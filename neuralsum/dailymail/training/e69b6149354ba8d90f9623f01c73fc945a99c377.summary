@entity0 is to write off £ 220million in debts of 330,000 customers after the company admitted it has made loans to people who could not afford to repay them , it was revealed today			1
the move by the pay - day lender comes after an agreement with the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) that requires it to make significant changes to its business immediately			1
the review means that about 330,000 customers who are currently in excess of 30 days in arrears will have the balance of their loan written off and will owe @entity0 nothing			1
pay - day lender : @entity0 is to write off the debts of 330,000 customers whose loans would not have been made under new affordability criteria being introduced approximately 45,000 customers who are up to 29 days in arrears will be asked to repay their debt without interest and charges and will be given an option of paying off their debt over an extended period of four months			1
@entity0 's new chairman @entity32 said : ' when i joined @entity0 i was made aware of concerns the @entity11 had already expressed around affordable lending , concerns which i shared			1
' i committed to ensuring our lending is conducted in a responsible and transparent manner , delivering the best outcomes for our customers			2
' i also said this would lead to a tightening of @entity0 ’s lending criteria and we will now be accepting far fewer applications from new and existing customers			1
' we want to ensure we only lend to those who can reasonably afford the loan in question and during my review , it became clear to me that this has unfortunately not always been the case			0
' i agreed with the concerns expressed by the @entity11 and as a consequence of our discussions we have committed to taking these actions			2
' new strategy : @entity0 put an end to its puppet adverts to prevent young people being lured into debt customers should continue to make payments unless they are told to stop by the firm			1
new chairman : @entity32 said he wants @entity0 's lending to be ' conducted in a responsible and transparent manner ' from today , the company has introduced new interim lending criteria and is working to put in place a new permanent platform as soon as possible			2
@entity0 said it would be accepting significantly fewer loan applications and that some existing customers would no longer be able to use the service			2
mr @entity32 added : ' it ’s clear to me that the need for change at @entity0 is real and urgent			0
our regulator is determined to improve standards in consumer credit and i share that determination			0
' there is much to do in order to make @entity0 a sustainable and accepted business , and today ’s announcement is a significant step forward in that process			1
' @entity0 will be contacting all customers by october 10 to notify them if they will be included in the redress programme			2
when it took over regulation of consumer credit in april , the @entity11 requested information from @entity0 which subsequently suggested it was not taking adequate steps to assess customers ' ability to meet repayments			1
@entity11 director of supervision @entity103 said : ‘ we are determined to drive up standards in the consumer credit market and it is disappointing that some firms still have a way to go to meet our expectations			0
‘ this should put the rest of the industry on notice - they need to lend affordably and responsibly			0
‘ it is absolutely right that @entity0 's new management team has acted quickly to put things right for their customers after these issues were raised by the @entity11			1
’ the total cost to @entity0 of writing off loans and not imposing interest and other charges will be £ 255million			1
this is made up of £ 220million lost through writing off the debts incurred by 330,000 of its customers and a further £ 35million lost by not imposing certain fees and charges and not making debt collections			1
most of the £ 220million has been accounted for already by @entity0 and it expects the £ 35million cost to feature in its accounting for 2014			0
the total number of customers who will have their loans either completely written off or who will see some charges dropped comes to around one fifth of the 1.8million people who have ever taken out a loan with @entity0			1
compared : while @entity0 's revenues were up by £ 5million in 2013 , their costs increased by almost £ 50million @entity0 's profits more than halved last year after it racked up £ 18.8million in costs relating to a scandal over fake legal letters			0
archbishop : @entity155 in @entity156 today archbishop of canterbury @entity155 has said the lending and savings industry should be a good servant , not a bad master			1
he welcomed @entity0 's decision to write off debt as an effort to put right some of the things that have gone wrong in the past			2
but the head of the @entity168 said the major issue was to create a reformed financial system			0
‘ the big issue is to create a financial system that gives access to the poor and hope for the poorest in our lands , to be able to flourish and develop and have proper access to finance , not just for loans but for savings			0
for lives in which finance is a good servant , not a bad master			1
’ mr @entity155 has been a high - profile opponent of pay day lenders			0
but it was revealed earlier this year that the @entity187 had £ 75,000 indirectly invested in @entity0 out of investments totalling £ 5.2billion			0
the revelation came after the archbishop received widespread publicity when he told @entity192 , @entity0 chief executive , that the @entity187 wanted to drive the pay - day lenders out of business through the creation of credit unions			2
during a visit to @entity156 today he said : ‘ i welcome anything in which the pay day lenders are involved in seeking to put right some of the things that have gone wrong in the past , which has left people burdened by debt that should never have been there , caught up in things which sometimes they did not fully see what they were getting into			0
’ the @entity187 , which claims to have a strong ethical investment policy that explicitly bans companies involved in pay day lending , had invested in @entity210 , the @entity211 venture capital firm that led @entity0 's 2009 fundraising			2
mr @entity155 said in july that he was irritated and embarrassed that @entity168 funds were being funnelled into @entity0 and said he would seek to remedy the situation			1
the company has said it expects it will be ‘ smaller and less profitable ’ in the near term as it carries out the task of cleaning up its reputation			0
in june , @entity0 was ordered to pay compensation of £ 2.6 million by the @entity11 after sending threatening legal letters from fake law firms to 45,000 customers			1
the regulator said @entity0 had been guilty of ‘ unfair and misleading debt collection practices ’ by creating fake companies to pressure struggling customers into paying their bills			1
the seven - year - old firm , which unlike many payday lenders has its roots in the @entity230 rather than the @entity211 , has around one million customers and a default rate of around 7 per cent on its loans			0
@entity0 is one of several payday lenders which recently signed up to a new real - time information sharing service , helping it to make more accurate decisions about who to lend money to			2
going ahead , @entity0 plans to overhaul the image it presents to the public , especially through its advertising , in a way that cuts the risk of it inadvertently attracting the very young or vulnerable			0
@entity0 's cuddly , elderly puppets disappeared from tv screens in july , as mr @entity32 said he was ‘ very aware ’ of criticism of its marketing campaign			0
the firm has no immediate plans to launch a new advertising drive			0
which ? executive director @entity257 said : ‘ @entity0 's announcement is better late than never for struggling borrowers but it 's clearly a result of the regulator taking a tougher approach			0
the @entity11 must keep payday lenders on a tight leash			0
' we have long called for more responsible affordability checks and better advice			0
the next step must be a clamp down on excessive fees and charges across the board to show lenders that the @entity11 will continue to clean up the credit market			2
’ and @entity277 , chief executive of @entity278 , said : ‘ a lack of checks by lenders is setting a debt trap for borrowers			0
people are left struggling to make ends meet as high interest rates and charges quickly ramp up debts			1
‘ the @entity11 is right to come down hard on @entity0 after it found it had poor affordability processes but it is not only lender guilty of this - it is a widespread problem within the industry			1
’ and dr @entity294 from @entity295 said : ‘ while companies like @entity0 may appear to provide a useful service to people caught up in serious financial difficulty , the help they provide must be ethical and responsible			2
this must be underpinned by a fair and robust internal governance framework , which protects the vulnerable			0
' although @entity0 ’s latest move was voluntary , the rest of the industry may have to alter their behaviour more proactively to prevent the hammer of regulation from the @entity11 falling at their doors			1

@entity0 admits it made loans to people who could *n't* afford to repay them
agreement with @entity11 means it must make significant changes to business
330,000 customers in excess of 30 days in arrears will owe @entity0 nothing
45,000 up to 29 days will be asked to repay debt without interest *&* charges
