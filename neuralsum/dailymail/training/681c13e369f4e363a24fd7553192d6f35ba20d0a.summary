raising a glass to her 11 dining companions , the bubbles in @entity5 's champagne sparkle in the candlelight			1
a waitress emerges to clear away the goat 's cheese ravioli starter before serving each guest with a lime and lemon granita palate cleanser , complete with tiny limoncello spheres — something @entity15 would surely be proud of			2
next up is a vibrant pea , mint and honeyed ham hock soup , each bowl perched amid an ornate nest of twigs			0
then , beef wellington and a mint chocolate delice for dessert			0
secret weapon : @entity5 , right , hires @entity27 , ' a home gourmet ' , to cook meals to wow her dinner party guests you might imagine that this decadent feast is being served in a swanky @entity35 - starred restaurant — the kind most of us can only dream of affording to go to			1
in fact , the setting is a lot closer to home			0
well , @entity5 's home anyway			1
it is the dining room of her five - bedroom country house near @entity45 in rural @entity46			0
more impressive still is the fact that @entity5 , 40 , an international sales director for a homeware company , has not lifted a finger all night			1
neither , has she decanted a stash of @entity52 ready meals to pass off as her own			0
so how has @entity5 pulled off this amazing feat ? @entity5 's secret is one which a growing number of middle - class women share			1
quite simply , they hire a private chef to slave over their stoves so they can sit back and socialise with friends			1
@entity5 , who 's married to @entity63 , 41 , a businessman , is adamant it 's the way forward			1
' some might say that paying up to £ 750 for a dinner party for 12 people is extravagant , ' she says			1
' but we work long hours and earn good money , and i 'm often away in the @entity70 , so to me it 's a small price to pay for buying quality time with close friends			1
because i 'm worth it : @entity5 would rather pay someone to cook so she can relax with friends a selection of @entity27 's dishes : from left , ham hock and pea soup , goats cheese wrapped in smoked salmon and mini cheesecakes with raspberries and edible flowers ' having someone cook for you in your own home is intimate and indulgent , from the canapes and cocktails to the menu and even how the table is decorated			1
many women would struggle to justify the equivalent cost of a month 's food shopping for a family on one dinner party			1
and if friends are true friends , would n't they be equally as happy with a casual lasagne ? it would seem not			2
the popularity of tv shows like @entity104 and @entity105 has raised expectations of what people should serve at their own dinner parties			1
a hearty casserole or fish pie just wo n't cut the mustard any more			0
additionally , a recent survey concluded that the average dinner party host spends six - and - a - half hours preparing food			1
' there 's a significant trend for ordinary middle - class people wanting to hire chefs to cook for special occasions in their own homes , ' says @entity123 of @entity124 , an agency that provides house staff including nannies , tutors and butlers			2
hired help : @entity131 regularly employs chef @entity132 , whose company is called @entity134			1
to dazzle her dinner party guests more relaxing : @entity137 says @entity132 is worth every penny as she can enjoy the dinner party and her friends do n't have a harassed host constantly dashing to the kitchen a year ago , in response to demand , they launched a spin - off business , my chef , dedicated purely to this			1
' many people told us they 're turning to dinner parties again because they 're fed up with the waiting lists at high - end restaurants , ' she says			0
' others said they 'd installed incredible kitchens and dining rooms at great expense yet never made use of them			0
' @entity5 and her husband moved into their home a year ago			2
' we 've got a grand dining table that seats 12 and enough bedrooms and bathrooms for our guests to stay over			0
many of them bring their little ones with them too and they sleep upstairs while we eat , ' says @entity5 , who does n't have children herself			2
her private chef of choice is @entity27 , 40 , who describes herself as a home gourmet			1
she is based in @entity175 and her clients include sports stars			0
@entity5 first hired @entity27 to accompany the extended family on a break to a cottage in @entity181 in 2011 where they celebrated her father - in - law 's 70th birthday			1
' we did n't want anyone to be put upon with shopping and cooking so we paid more than £ 1,000 for @entity27 to come with us , which included all the food for the weekend , ' @entity5 adds			1
' she produced every morsel that we ate , including making croissants for breakfast , picnic lunches and a posh birthday dinner party			1
' she and @entity63 have since hired @entity27 a dozen times to cater for them , including a five - course meal for @entity199			0
' as the host , you invite your friends over because you want to spend time in their company , but when you 're doing the cooking you miss out on the conversation , ' @entity5 says			1
' having @entity27 means we can fully engage with our friends — she even brings a waitress			0
' i 've never tried to hoodwink my guests into thinking i 've done the cooking , i always make sure @entity27 gets the credit			0
' the total cost sounds a lot , and per head it works out at anything from about £ 50 to £ 80 depending how extravagant @entity5 wants to be with the menu			1
naturally she would never dream of asking her guests to contribute financially			0
less stress : @entity220 calls upon chef @entity221 — who runs a company called @entity223 — when she feels she ca n't stand the heat in the kitchen no sweat : @entity220 says forking out for chefs at home is worth it - especially as they also do the washing up ' it would be the height of rudeness , ' she says			2
' i would n't cook a meal myself and then expect everyone to chip in			0
so why is this any different ? ' meanwhile , in @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity131 regularly hires a chef to dazzle her dinner guests at the farmhouse she shares with husband @entity63 , 43 , a software developer , and their five children , @entity243 , 22 , @entity244 , 20 , @entity245 , 17 , @entity246 , 13 , and @entity247 , eight			1
' we first started hiring chefs in our 30s when we lived in @entity250 , but since we moved here four years ago and discovered that the social scene revolves around dinner parties , we 've done it a lot more , ' says @entity137 , 43 , who works in television			2
' while i 'm happy cooking sunday lunch for 20 people , when it comes to dinner parties i 'm a perfectionist and put myself under a lot of pressure to shine			0
' the antidote to @entity137 's stress is local chef @entity132 , whom she discovered three years ago when she and @entity63 needed someone to create a dinner for 100 people to celebrate 25 years together			2
' we were so impressed with her food that we 've been hiring her to create small dinner parties for us ever since , ' @entity137 adds			1
' a three - course dinner for ten people works out at about £ 400 which might sound a lot , but you could spend that going to a gastropub			2
' @entity123 concurs that most of the people who hire chefs through @entity124 are time - starved professionals in their 30s to 50s			0
' they work really hard , so every spare moment is precious , ' she says			0
' if you think of the bill for dining in a @entity35 - starred restaurant , it 's much more affordable to hire a chef			2
' @entity137 discovered this the expensive way			0
celebrity favourite hotel @entity292 — the venue for the weddings of @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity298 — is a mile from her home and last year she organised a birthday dinner there for @entity63			0
' there were 14 of us and the bill , including booze , came to more than £ 1,500 , ' @entity137 says			0
' yes , it was wonderful , but we can have food cooked by @entity132 at home that 's every bit as delicious and costs half the price			2
' is @entity137 ever tempted to squirrel @entity132 out of the back door and pass the food off as her own ? ' never , ' she laughs , ' but equally i never feel like it 's a cop out			0
people love it — as a guest you do n't want to see your hostess looking fraught as she dashes between dining room and kitchen either			0
' it 's a sentiment shared by @entity220 , 50 , a freelance theatre consultant			1
despite being an avid cook , she calls upon chef @entity221 — who runs a company called @entity223 — when she feels she ca n't stand the heat in the kitchen			2
' my husband and i do quite a lot of entertaining , and we love to cook but occasionally , either as a treat or when life is just too busy , we 'll hire @entity221 to cater for a dinner party , ' says @entity220 , who lives near @entity335 in @entity336 with husband @entity337 , a theatre set designer , and their children @entity339 , 18 , @entity341 , 15 , and @entity342 , 14			1
' the trouble is that we 're ambitious about our own cooking which means it 's expensive because we buy ingredients such as pheasant and scallops			0
two days are wiped out buying the food and preparing dinner , and another half day clearing up the mess afterwards			2
hiring @entity221 removes that stress			0
' @entity5 sums it up : ' it 's not just about eating fabulous food that you have n't had to cook yourself — it 's the experience of being waited on in your own home			1
best of all , there 's no washing up at the end of the evening			0
that 's got to be worth every penny			0

shows like @entity104 has raised expectations of what should be served
@entity5 , 40 , is adamant hiring a private chef is the way forward
they slave over the stove while she socialises with her friends
' some might say paying £ 750 for a dinner party is extravagant , ' she says
but she adds : ' it 's a small price to pay for buying quality time with friends '
she also paid chef £ 1,000 to cook for them on *holiday*
@entity220 , 50 , and @entity131 , 43 , from @entity238 , agree
