by @entity0 last updated at 11:46 pm on 18th october 2011 a judge had to leave court while his anger subsided before sentencing a teenage mother who repeatedly beat her baby son and left him severely disabled			1
@entity6 , 19 , had slammed three - month - old @entity7 against a door , dropped him into his @entity10 basket and was even thought to have stamped on his head			1
she initially blamed her sex offender boyfriend for the horrifying abuse which left her baby with brain damage , but later admitted she was responsible , blaming the ‘ stresses ’ of being a mother			2
anger : @entity6 was jailed for eight years for the savage attack on her baby son by judge @entity21 , right , who said the offence angered him so greatly he was forced to spend 15 minutes composing himself before sentencing after the catalogue of assaults were detailed to judge @entity26 , he took the unusual step of revealing he needed to take a short break to avoid sentencing her in anger			1
following a 15 - minute adjournment , he returned to court to condemn the teenager as ‘ heartless and remorseless ’ and reject her claim that she had struggled to cope			0
‘ @entity7 ’s present plight is so distressing that i felt it necessary to adjourn for some time after hearing the case to make sure that i was not sentencing you in anger , for to do so would have been wrong , ’ he told her			0
jailing her for eight years , he went on : ‘ it is almost unimaginable that a mother could have inflicted such injuries on her own child , and furthermore shown no remorse at all			0
at @entity44 , pictured , judge @entity26 said @entity6 lacked ' basic humanity ' jailed : @entity46 , 19 , was sent to a young offenders institution for three years after earlier pleading guilty to child cruelty ‘ your conduct throughout the inquiry and the case have shown you to be completely heartless			1
you appear to lack even the basic humanity			1
’ @entity6 inflicted a series of injuries on @entity7 at their @entity57 home , slamming his head against a door , shaking him and slapping him on the back of the head when he began crying			1
the baby was taken to hospital last february with a fractured skull , bleeding to the brain and a broken collarbone			0
now almost one year old and being cared for in a hospice , he has irreparable brain damage , is blind and suffers considerable pain and frequent severe spasms			2
college student @entity6 initially blamed the injuries on ex-boyfriend @entity46			2
as he had been convicted of offences against two teenage girls , she had signed an agreement with social services to keep the 18 - year - old away from @entity7			1
but unbeknown to even her own parents , who lived next door , she let him share responsibility for @entity7 after deceiving him into believing he was the father , the court heard			0
however he stood by and did nothing as @entity6 repeatedly beat her child			2
after @entity7 was taken to hospital last february , @entity6 claimed @entity46 had shaken and ‘ belted ’ the baby			2
@entity46 was arrested and held in custody for a day , but @entity6 later admitted she was to blame			0
@entity6 pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm , child cruelty and perverting the course of justice			0
defending , @entity92 told @entity44 she had ‘ tried her best ’ but was ‘ young and inadequate ’			0
but judge @entity21 told @entity6 : ‘ i do n’t think you cared for him at all			1
’ @entity46 , now 19 , of @entity97 , @entity98 , was sent to a young offenders institution for three years after earlier pleading guilty to child cruelty .			0
