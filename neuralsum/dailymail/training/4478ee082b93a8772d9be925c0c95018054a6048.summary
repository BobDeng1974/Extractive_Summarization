by @entity0 gp surgeries will be given @entity3 style ratings and the worst will be shut down			1
the care watchdog will start inspecting all 8,000 practices this october and grading them ' outstanding ' , ' good ' , ' requires improvement ' or ' inadequate			1
' those rated inadequate will be placed in special measures if they fail to improve within six months â€“ or in the worst cases , immediately			1
this will mean they will be put under close supervision by the @entity15 watchdog and @entity17 officials and given a series of targets			2
gp surgeries will be graded ' outstanding ' , ' good ' , ' requires improvement ' or ' inadequate ' from october ( file picture ) if they fail to meet these targets and are deemed to be providing unsafe care , they will be closed down			1
this is the first national inspection of @entity29 surgeries and the @entity15 says it can not say how many could be put in special measures			1
but pilot checks on 900 practices last year by the watchdog found that 1 in 3 were failing to meet basic standards in one area of care			1
it included two which were infected with maggots and nine where standards were so poor they could affect thousands of patients			0
if the @entity15 's inspectors uncover concerns about a particular gp they will be referred to the @entity45 who could decide to strike them off or suspend them			0
professor @entity48 , a senior gp and chief inspector of @entity29 at the @entity15 said ; ' most gp practices provide good care			1
' we have confirmed this in our pilot inspections so far			0
but we ca n't allow those that provide poor care to continue to let their patients have an inadequate service			2
pilot checks on 900 practices last year by the watchdog found that 1 in 3 were failing to meet basic standards in one area of care ( file picture ) ' i want to do all i can to drive up standards in those that are not providing the services people deserve			1
' we need to have a clear framework and a process to respond to those gp practices that are providing inadequate care to ensure that they ca n't continue to provide inadequate care indefinitely			2
' special measures will firstly promote improvement , but where practices do not improve , working with @entity81 we will call time on poor care			1
' special measures will be viewed as the final chance for a practice to improve			1
' in december the @entity15 published findings of its pilot inspections of 900 practices which showed 300 were failing in at least one standard			2
they included patients being given out - of - date medicines or injections , and nurses not trained in basic first aid			0
in ten cases the failings were so severe they could potentially affect thousands of patients , the @entity15 warned at the time			0
but the @entity29 's union the @entity98 warned that the tough new inspections could create a blame culture			2
dr @entity101 , chair of the @entity98 's gp committee , said : ' gps care passionately about their patients , and it is only right that they should receive the best standards of care regardless of the gp practice they are registered with			0
' however , it is important not to create a counterproductive blame culture based on isolated examples that would wrongly damage patient trust in wider gp services			0
' @entity116 , chief executive of the @entity45 , said : ' whenever @entity15 's new inspection system raises concerns about the competency of individual gps , the matter will be referred to the @entity29 's local @entity121 and if necessary to the @entity45			2
' family doctors are now subject to regular checks , but the inspections in @entity81 are bound to expose areas of weakness as well as good practice			0
' we will work closely with @entity15 and local @entity129 to help drive up standards			0
' @entity131 , deputy medical director for @entity81 , the body overseeing the running of the @entity17 said : ' our vision is to see general practice play an even stronger role in the heart of local communities , offering more joined up , high quality services			0
as part of this , we want to help @entity120 to provide ever higher standards of care to patients			0
