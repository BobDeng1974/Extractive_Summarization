from @entity1 to @entity2 , personal robots have been one of the most widely portrayed future technologies in science fiction movies			1
and now one company claims they are close to bringing the fiction into reality with their @entity10 personal robot			1
the human - sized android can apparently perform simple tasks like walking the dog and serving drinks , or more complex tasks like assisting doctors and nurses in a hospital			2
@entity10 ( shown ) is described as the first human size personal robot designed for everyday practical use			2
the innovation received press in 2011 , but now the developers have launched a @entity33 campaign for £ 320,000 ( $ 500,000 ) @entity35 - based company @entity34 believe their product will revolutionise robotics in the same way that the pc did home computing and the @entity41 revolutionised mobile electronics			1
the innovation received press in 2011 , but now the developers have launched a @entity33 campaign for the £ 320,000 ( $ 500,000 ) needed to bring @entity10 to market			1
early adopters will get the robot for $ 999 , rather than the expected £ 965 ( $ 1,500 ) price tag , with a scheduled december 2015 shipping date			1
height : 5ft ( 1.5m ) weight : 60 lbs ( 27.2kg ) motherboard : mini-itx @entity55 : @entity56 storage : @entity58 screen : 8 " @entity60 camera : hi - def with wide angle lens @entity63 ( @entity64 ) : seven usb @entity66 : @entity67 interaction with @entity10 is possible using an 8 - inch touchscreen display on its face , as well as through a microphone , wireless and cellular communication			1
the robot stands five feet tall with two ‘ arms ’ on either side of its body			2
it rolls around on wheels - which might hamper its ability somewhat just as it did the @entity83 in @entity84			0
but the design of the robot is open source , and with multiple usb ports the makers claim that anyone could design accessories or various add - ons for it			1
it also features an hd camera and a carrying handle			0
personal robots have been frequently portrayed in science fiction movies , such as @entity1 ( shown ) and @entity2 from 2001 : a @entity98			2
now @entity34 say their @entity10 android could bring robots to the masses			1
the 5ft ( 1.5m ) tall android can be programmed to perform a number of tasks @entity10 is pictured left with @entity34 founder @entity105			1
on the right , near its base , can be seen the cameras and some of the usb ports that can be used to attach other devices			0
however , as the robot is on wheels its movements will likely be somewhat limited professor @entity116 has warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment			2
speaking at an event in @entity124 earlier this month , the physicist told the @entity125 : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			0
' this echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating @entity134 ' would be the biggest event in human history , [ but ] unfortunately , it might also be the last			0
' he argued that developments in digital personal assistants @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 are merely symptoms of an it arms race which ' pale against what the coming decades will bring			0
' but professor @entity116 noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant , with the potential to eradicate , war , disease and poverty			0
‘ since our founding 11 years ago our mission is to bring robots to the masses , ’ said @entity34 founder @entity105			1
‘ we believe that robots and humans can live and work in harmony together			0
that 's why we made @entity10			0
‘ @entity10 is a personal robot designed for everyday practical use			2
she is a powerful platform capable of an increasing universe of apps and services through an app store model			0
’ among the number of tasks that @entity10 could perform , the makers say it could be used to keep an eye on the elderly in their own home			1
it could also be employed as a medical assisting , reminding patients to take their medicine or assisting nurses by fetching items			0
and it could even be used as a patrolling security system for buildings , allowing humans to avoid dangerous situations			0
other uses and limitations of the robot have not yet been revealed , but the company is adamant that @entity10 can kick - start the personal robot industry			1
they rather ambitiously aim to see a robot in every home by 2021			0
interaction with @entity10 is possible using an 8 - inch touchscreen display on its face ( shown ) , as well as through a microphone , wireless and cellular communication early adopters will get the @entity201 robot for $ 999 , rather than the expected $ 1,500 price tag , with a scheduled december 2015 shipping date			1
@entity34 rather ambitiously aims to see a robot in every home by 2021			0

@entity35 - based @entity34 is seeking funding for its @entity10 robot
they say it could bring personal robots to the masses
the 5ft ( 1.5m ) tall droid has a touchscreen ' face ' and two arms
it can be programmed to perform a number of tasks
and it is open - source - so others can design attachments for it
@entity34 says it could be employed as a medical assistant or even walk your dog
however as it is on wheels its movements are somewhat limited
@entity10 can be reserved now for £ *645* ( $ 999 ) *ahead* of release in dec 2015
