by @entity0 @entity1 claims it has turned a corner in its efforts to create the ultimate self - driving car			1
in a blog post , the company said its self - driving cars have now mastered motorway driving			1
but city driving - with its obstacle course of stray walkers , bicyclists and blind corners - has been a far greater challenge for the cars ' computers			1
but it said city driving has been a far greater challenge for the cars ' computers and it will now be focusing on improving technology in this area			1
pictured is @entity1 co-founder @entity25 after riding in a driverless car with officials @entity28 , the project 's leader , said test cars now can handle thousands of urban situations that would have stumped them a year ago			1
‘ we 're growing more optimistic that we 're heading toward an achievable goal - a vehicle that operates fully without human intervention , ’ he wrote			2
@entity28 's post was the company 's first official update since 2012 on progress toward a driverless car , which has been underway within the company 's secretive @entity43 lab. the company has said its goal is to get the technology to the public by 2017			1

@entity63 - based @entity62 has decided to pimp @entity65 ’s ride in its latest concept car for truly autonomous driving			1
designed to be a car , office , living room and urban space all in one package , the @entity69 electric vehicle aims to make driving completely stress - free			1
‘ travelling in a driverless car will no longer require me to stare at the road , but will let me spend my time in a more meaningful way , ’ said @entity62 founder @entity75			0
the all - electric touring sedan features seats that can tilt , swivel and slide into more than twenty different seating arrangements			2
according to the company , ‘ passengers will be able to assume virtually any seating or resting position when travelling in the car			0
’ to begin with , human drivers would be expected to take control if the computer fails			0
the promise is that , eventually , there would be no need for a driver			0
passengers could read , daydream , sleep - or work - while the car drives			2
@entity1 maintains that computers will one day drive far more safely than humans , and part of the company 's pitch is that robotic cars can reduce traffic fatalities			1
the basics are now in place			0
the task for @entity1 now is perfecting the technology strapped onto its fleet of about two dozen @entity110			1
sensors including radar and lasers create 3d maps of a self - driving car 's surroundings in real - time , while @entity1 's software sorts objects into four categories			1
these include moving vehicles , pedestrians , cyclists and static objects such as signs , curbs and parked cars			0
initially , the car ’s capabilities were fairly crude			0
a group of pedestrians on a street corner registered as a single person			2
now , the technology can distinguish individuals , according to @entity1 spokeswoman @entity137			1
to deal with cyclists , engineers initially programmed the software to look for hand gestures that indicate an upcoming turn			0
the company has said its goal is to get the technology to the public by 2017			2
to begin with , human drivers would be expected to take control if the computer fails			0
the promise is that , eventually , there would be no need for a driver			0
passengers could read , daydream , sleep - or work - while the car drives then they realised that most cyclists do n't use standard gestures - and still others weave down a road the wrong way			2
engineers have taught the software to predict the behaviour of cyclists based on thousands of encounters during the approximately 10,000 miles ( 16,000 km ) the cars have driven autonomously on city streets , @entity137 said			1
the software projects a cyclist 's likely movements and plots the car 's path accordingly - then reacts if something unexpected happens			0
‘ a mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of freeway driving , with hundreds of different objects moving according to different rules of the road in a small area , ’ @entity28 wrote			1
before recent breakthroughs , @entity1 had considered mapping all the world 's stop signs			2
now the technology can read stop signs , including those held in the hands of school crossing guards , @entity137 added			0
this is the view the car sees when its navigating an intersection			0
initially , the car 's capabilities were fairly crude			0
a group of pedestrians on a street corner registered as a single person , for example			0
now , the technology can distinguish individuals a user , who is legally blind , sat behind the wheel during a recent test drive and showed off to the passengers that no hands were needed to date , @entity1 's cars have gone about 700,000 miles ( 1.1 million km ) in self - driving mode mean streets : @entity1 cars have driven about 700,000 accident - free miles ( 1.1 million km ) on motorways in ' autonomous mode '			1
@entity1 has been focusing on city driving for the past year			1
to - do list : @entity1 's @entity110 are retrofitted with lasers , radar and cameras rapidly learned how to handle thousands of urban driving situations			1
improvements are needed in merging and lane changes , turning right on red and handling bad weather			0
local tests : so far , the tech giant has focused on street driving in @entity226 , @entity60			1
the state , along with , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 , have formally opened public streets to testing of self - driving cars			1
the future is ( almost ) here : in 2012 , @entity1 co-founder @entity25 predicted that the public would be able to get hold of the technology within five years			1
this prediction has not been revised			0
@entity1 , the carmaker : while @entity1 has enough money to invest in making cars , that likelihood is remote			2
industry experts believe more likely options include collaborating with major car makers or giving away the software , as @entity1 did with its android operating system			2
while the car knows when to stop , when to start again is still a challenge because the cars are programmed to drive defensively			0
at a four - way stop , @entity1 's cars have been known to wait in place as people driving in other directions edge out into the intersection			1
the cars still need work on other predictably common tasks			0
among them , understanding the gestures that drivers give one another to signal it 's fine to merge or change lanes , turning right on red and driving in rain or fog			0
‘ you can count on one hand the number of years until people , ordinary people , can experience this , ' company co-founder @entity25 said in 2012			0
he made the remarks at a ceremony where @entity60 governor @entity275 signed legislation legalising the cars on public roads in the state			1
to date , @entity1 's cars have gone about 700,000 miles ( 1.1 million km ) in self - driving mode , the vast majority on motoways , the company said			1
@entity60 's @entity284 is in the process of writing regulations to implement that law			2
@entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 , also have written driverless car laws			0
@entity1 has not said how it plans to market the technology			1
options include collaborating with major carmakers or giving away the software , as the company did with its android operating system			0
while @entity1 has the balance sheet to invest in making cars , that likelihood is remote			2
traditional automakers also are developing driverless cars			0
@entity301 chief exectuve @entity300 said he hopes to deliver a model to the public by 2020 .			0

@entity1 has fleet of @entity306 retrofitted with lasers , radar and cameras
the fleet has done 700,000 accident - free miles ( 1.1m km ) on motorways
@entity1 has been focusing on improving city driving for the past year
so far , tech giant has focused street driving in @entity226 , @entity60
it predicts that the public could get hold of the technology within 3 years
