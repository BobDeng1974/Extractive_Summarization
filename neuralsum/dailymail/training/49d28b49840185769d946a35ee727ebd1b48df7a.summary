@entity0 is determined not to rush @entity1 back into action too quickly but will send him away on @entity4 duty with his blessing			1
@entity6 will receive no special instruction from the @entity9 manager about how to treat the winger who has played only 10 minutes of competitive football since rupturing cruciate knee ligaments in january			1
@entity6 has called @entity1 into the squad for a @entity15 qualifier against @entity16 and a friendly against @entity18			1
the winger has not played for @entity4 for more than a year			1
he has been out 10 months			1
people think it ’s like a machine			2
these are human beings and to get back into rhythm of top competition it takes time			2
' @entity6 is free to do what he wants			1
he has been injured in an accidental tackle against @entity40 and you can not plan that it will never happen again			2
' every time you have a big injury there is a bigger chance of having the next one			2
he has been taken care of well			2
we have to leave him in peace and give him time to come back			2
' @entity4 international @entity1 could make his first start since january when @entity9 travel to @entity21 @entity1 , in training earlier this week , suffered a serious knee injury in @entity9 's @entity56 win over @entity40 @entity9 head to @entity21 off the back of a disappointing 3 - 3 draw against @entity24 at the @entity60 on tuesday evening			1
the @entity61 were cruising to victory after goals from @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , but the visitors scored three times inside the final 30 minutes to leave the home fans reeling at the final whistle			1
@entity1 went down injured in @entity9 's @entity56 win over @entity72 at the @entity60 in january @entity1 reminded @entity40 fans of the score as he left the pitch on a stretcher ' they were disappointed , ' said @entity0 of his side after the draw which left @entity9 's bid to top the group in tatters			1
' it was a shock straight after game but we know we can score goals and we know we can do better defensively			2
@entity65 scored @entity9 's second goal against @entity24 with 29 minutes gone at the @entity60 @entity0 watches on from the bench as @entity9 throw away a three - goal lead against the @entity90 side ' it ’s harder to put the first part in the game than the second part			1
regardless of the score you have to play the right way			0
' we are very positive			0
inside our camp we are very positive			0
we are not touched by the criticism			0
when we do n’t win we are not happy			0
the rest we can live with			0
' @entity102 struck twice for @entity24 before @entity104 's last - gasp leveller but the first goal was clearly offside			1
@entity104 gets ahead of @entity106 to haul @entity24 level in the closing stages @entity109 ( centre0 looks dejected after his side allowed a three - goal lead to slip at the @entity60 and @entity0 , who has long been a fan of technology in football , felt let down by the referee 's assistant behind @entity118 's goal and believes @entity119 need to find a better way of making sure the correct decisions are made on the pitch			1
' we can learn a lot from what happened on tuesday , ' he said			0
' we have special incidents			0
some things we can correct , like the second and third goals			0
but we can not influence the first goal			0
when the goalscorers are one yard offside , we can not influence that			0
' every time we go to @entity134 , ( @entity136 ) @entity135 ( @entity119 's chief refereeing officer ) explains to us that the fifth referee is a fantastic finding			1
' but when you see the pictures on the first goal , it is unbelievable			0
a guy stands behind the line in front of the offside guy and does not stay a word			0
' i do not know what the guys behind the line are paid for			0
that is a general feeling shared by everyone who watches football			2
they should buy a seat for them , and give them a good book ! ' @entity0 also labelled any of the criticism aimed at his side following the slip - up as ' predictable ' after former @entity61 favourite @entity163 said the team were ' tactically clueless '			1
' if you are 3 - 0 up and get back to 3 - 3 , you always get the same , ' @entity0 said when asked about the criticism			1
' i have managed 2,000 games and can anticipate what people will say			0
if you defend and get back to 3 - 3 , people will ask why you defend and not continue to play a normal game			0
if you continue to attack , people ask why you attack			0
' @entity9 set to open contract talks with @entity1			1
