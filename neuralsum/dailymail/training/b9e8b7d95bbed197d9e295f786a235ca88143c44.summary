by @entity0 he was once named one of the world ’s sexiest vegetarians			1
however it is an accolade that is no longer true for @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
he revealed yesterday that having ‘ consciously uncoupled ’ from his marriage to @entity14 actress @entity13 he has also relinquished the vegetarian lifestyle that came with it and is now once again a carnivore			1
the 37 year - old @entity16 star let slip about his change in diet during an interview with @entity20 on @entity21 yesterday			1
i was vegetarian for a long time but for various reasons i changed			1
' my daughter [ @entity31 , 10 ] has been a vegetarian since she was born			1
i keep getting tempted to go back but i do n’t eat too much meat			2
’ warming to his theme he then bizarrely said : ‘ the honest answer why i changed is because i thought you can only eat something that you should be able to kill			2
' i do n’t why i am talking about this			2
i have got to stop as there will be some sort of headline			2
i mean “ could you kill a fish ? ” i would not like it but i probably could eat the fish ... or a giraffe ... i have been called the world ’s sexiest vegetarian			1
i do n’t think i am the world ’s sexiest singer			1
i think i came about 17th			2
’ miss @entity13 ’s enthusiasm for following a vegetarian diet is well - documented and she has written a cookbook and blogged about the health benefits of following a diet rich in plants and seeds			1
the perfect split ? @entity13 and @entity6 have remained close since their split and are even still living together and so stringent is her approach to diet she once admitted that her whole family can at times feel hungry because she will not allow them to eat carbohydrates like bread , pasta or white rice			1
the @entity69 star announced on her @entity71 lifestyle website in march that she and @entity6 were ‘ consciously uncoupling ’ after 10 years			2
the break up between @entity73 , 41 , and the @entity75 - born singer , appears to be amicable and the pair have even been spotted out together since looking close and comfortable in each other ’s company			1
’ miss @entity13 wrote on her website at the time of the announcement that she and mr @entity6 had tried in vain to save their marriage for over a year but that they would always be a family and their main concern was the welfare of their children			1
they also have a son , eight - year - old @entity92			1
when asked how he deals with such a major personal upheaval while performing mr @entity6 replied : ‘ my job is so uplifting and that naturally is an endorphin			0
‘ i am very lucky i have some good teachers and good people who have written some great things that make you able to alchemise			0
’ he also said that music has helped him through other tough times in the past and described his craft as his ‘ friend ’			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ music , especially over the last couple of years has been very alchemising			0
i mean if you are going through something difficult in life or whatever and music for me is always a friend and something that helps me figure things out			0
‘ at the end of the day that is what i am always doing in the middle of the night			0
i need my time on my own with it and also like playing			0
’ both mr @entity6 and @entity73 are involved in charity work and the singer said that for him it stems from his mother always encouraging him to give a portion of his money away			0
he added : ‘ when i first got pocket money as a kid my mum told me i should give 10 per cent away			0
‘ so we just keep doing it			0
‘ i do n’t think that is corny at all			0
i think it would be amazing if more companies did that			0
‘ we always work with @entity133 in @entity134 and that is mainly what we do behind the scenes			0
‘ we are a tiny bit involved in prince @entity141 ’s @entity140 charity			2
that is something we have got inspired by			0
