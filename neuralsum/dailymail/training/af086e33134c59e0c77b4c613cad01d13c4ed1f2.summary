made in @entity43 also appears to have influenced @entity45 's parents , with @entity46 , as in @entity47 , and @entity50 , as in @entity49 , climbing the table			2
@entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 remain the top three names for girls , holding the same positions as last year			1
@entity57 still tops the list for boys , holding off stiff competition from @entity61 and @entity62 , which climbed one place to third			1
@entity80 the trends emerged from @entity83 's annual report of names handed out to 370,000 babies who were born in the @entity45 this year			2
bounty spokeswoman @entity86 said : ' only a handful of parents named their girls @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity2 , but this could well be the start of something			1
' the trend for old - fashioned names continues to grow for girls and boys			1
even @entity97 took the plunge this year naming his baby son @entity99 after his own father			0
' celebrities like the @entity9 are renowned for choosing unusual names for their offspring and today 's parents are quick to follow a trend in a bid to make sure their choice of baby names stands out from the crowd			1
' but baby name trends can change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom			2
' just a couple of years ago @entity114 and @entity115 were relatively unheard of as a baby girl 's name , yet now they regularly feature in the top ten			0
' likewise for boys , a decade ago the names @entity121 and @entity122 were rarely considered and now they are in the top 10 as parents look beyond previously traditional biblical names like @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			1
' the name @entity2 , made popular shortly after the @entity34 by the actress @entity131 , is making a comeback old - fashioned girls ' @entity3 and @entity4 are also returning , but @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 are the three most popular names for the second year running other big climbers in the girl 's list are @entity14 , up 36 places , @entity15 , up 29 , and @entity16 , up 16			1

@entity162 @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 were also given to one or two baby girls each , as were @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171			0
huge gains were made in the boys ' list by @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity175			0
@entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 also made big leaps			0
meanwhile @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 saw a slump in popularity			0
ms @entity86 added : ' whilst certain baby names can quickly rise to fame they can just as easily fall from favour			2
' @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 for example			0
now that they are more common in classrooms across the country they no longer make the grade for new parents who want a name that no other child is likely to have in the playground			0
' like celebrities , parents are getting more and more creative with their name choices			0
' indeed , for some the sky really is the limit when it comes to creating something unique			0
' generally speaking whatever a child is called they usually grow up to make it their own , yet mums and dads should bear in mind that a really individual name can be a lot to live up to if you do n't grow up to be rich or famous			0
