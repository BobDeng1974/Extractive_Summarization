the @entity0 - even without the injured @entity13 - never looked in danger of failing to chase down their modest target , though , @entity17 ( 55 ) and @entity18 ( 50 not out ) leading the way as they romped to victory from 30.3 overs for the loss of four wickets			1
@entity0 batsman @entity18 waves his bat after reaching 50 runs during the @entity3 match @entity17 was also in impressive form for the @entity0 during the @entity30 match the result left @entity0 guaranteed a last - eight berth courtesy of their net run - rate - unless sunday 's other @entity30 encounter between @entity35 and @entity36 ends in a tie or a no - result in @entity39			1
@entity5 were on the ropes at 46 for six at @entity41 , with none of the top six batsmen managing double figures , but @entity9 and @entity10 helped give the scoreline some respectability			0
@entity47 ( four for 27 ) and @entity48 ( three for 36 ) accounted for the @entity5 top order , as @entity50 ( five ) , @entity51 ( seven ) , @entity52 ( nought ) , @entity53 ( five ) , @entity54 ( two ) and @entity55 ( six ) all fell cheaply			0
@entity9 and @entity10 shared a 107 - run seventh - wicket stand to get @entity5 back on track , as the @entity0 failed to fully capitalise on their early superiority			2
@entity5 bowler @entity9 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity60 their spirited partnership finally ended in the 41st over , when @entity9 bottom - edged an @entity60 delivery onto his stumps			0

@entity72 accounted for @entity73 ( 15 ) and @entity69 ( nine ) within the first eight overs of the response , but @entity17 and @entity18 made sure @entity0 were always in control			1
@entity17 ' departure , having scored 55 from 40 balls , left the @entity0 109 for three in the 16th over			2
