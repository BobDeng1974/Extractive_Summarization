hi - tech thieves are simply driving off with cars and vans after bypassing security devices by attacking onboard computers increasing numbers of top - of - the - range vehicles are being stolen every day by thieves who simply drive off after bypassing security devices by hacking onboard computers			1
gangs using ‘ keyless ’ techniques are estimated to have stolen more than 6,000 vehicles in @entity15 alone last year – almost half of all cars and vans stolen			1
most of the vehicles are broken down within hours before being loaded on to containers and shipped to @entity21 and @entity22			2
top - of - the - range @entity23 and @entity24 , as well as @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 vans , make up 70 per cent of all vehicles stolen in this way			1
four - wheel - drive vehicles such as @entity24 are among the most commonly targeted because they can be used in countries with poor roads			1
one technique involves breaking into the vehicle and plugging a laptop into the hidden diagnostic socket used by garages to detect and solve faults			0
once connected the thieves can access the vehicle ’s electronic information , allowing them to drive it away			2
in some cases criminals have intercepted the remote ‘ lock ’ signal as the owner walks away , allowing them easy access to the vehicle			0
the theft can sometimes take as little as ten seconds , with some vehicles then fetching £ 10,000 on the black market			2
the trend threatens to destroy years of falling car crime figures as manufacturers create more secure vehicles			1
in @entity15 , police chiefs are so concerned at the surge that they have launched a week - long crackdown to try and catch those responsible red - handed			0
investigators have discovered the vehicles are driven to remote locations in the @entity65 where they are stripped down			2
they are then loaded into shipping containers and exported to clients in @entity22 , @entity68 , @entity21 , the @entity69 and even @entity70 and @entity71			0
some of the car theft rings are so sophisticated they can steal a car and get it out of the country in less than an hour			2
most of the thefts take place between 10pm and 4am between @entity79 , when the owner is least likely to return to the vehicle			0
top - of - the - range @entity24 , as well as @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 vans , make up 70 per cent of all vehicles stolen			1
most of the vehicles are broken down within hours just hours after being taken detective chief superintendent @entity87 , from the @entity88 , said car owners must wise up to the risk of their brand new car being stolen			1
he said : ‘ we believe that organised crime groups using this technique are responsible for the theft of thousands of vehicles in @entity15			1
‘ many of those that we have already arrested in connection with keyless vehicle theft have previous links to other types of serious crime			0
‘ these people currently view keyless vehicle theft as a low - risk , high - return crime , with the most valued motor engines fetching anything up to £ 1,000 when sold on the black market , and entire vehicles making up to £ 10,000			1
’ last year 90,000 vehicles were stolen in @entity115 and the authorities believe and many of these will have been exported			0
experts are concerned that thieves may even be using computer malware to take over vehicle systems via satellite , issuing remote commands for them to unlock and start up			0
bmws are also among the high - end vehicles being targeted by criminals across the country ( file picture ) many devices can be bought cheaply online , often from websites based in @entity132			1
they are accompanied by video tutorials posted online			0
the problem was first exposed several years ago in certain models , but police now suspect that all modern makes are potentially vulnerable			0
police advise car owners to leave their cars in well - lit areas , to consider using steering , gear shift and pedal locks , as well as tracking devices			1
@entity147 , of the @entity148 , called on the government to introduce stronger regulation to prevent vehicle diagnostic equipment falling into the wrong hands			0
he said : ‘ the challenge remains that some forms of keyless theft involve equipment legitimately available to workshops for routine repairs and servicing , and a small minority of individuals are exploiting this to access vehicles illegally			0
