in @entity2 , @entity1 , there seems to be an 18 percent surcharge for speaking @entity4			1
some waiters in the @entity7 tourist town have begun adding a mandatory tip onto the bill of foreign diners			1
restaurant owners say it 's their solution to an influx of @entity4 - speaking @entity14 from @entity15 who are extraordinarily bad tippers -- sometimes leaving just $ 1 or a few cents tip on $ 50 or $ 100 tabs			1
discrimination ? splash at the @entity20 is one of the restaurants in @entity2 , @entity1 , where servers add a mandatory 18 percent tip to @entity4 - speaking diners ' tabs at least one @entity1 resident , who grew up in @entity28 , says the new rules are discrimination and they might be illegal			1
she has been slapped with an automatic 18 percent gratuity three times because she often speaks @entity4 to her friends during dinner			1
restaurant owners say there 's no policy in place to include mandatory tip on diners from @entity14 and other countries			2
they claim they have left the decision up to individual waiters and waitresses			2
however , the practice is so common , servers refer to it as the ' @entity48 ' -- after the @entity51 who inspired it , @entity49 , a @entity1 news site , reports			1
the @entity54 is one restaurant where foreigners are likely to be hit with an 18 percent gratuity included on their bill			2
owner @entity59 told @entity60 that she was tired of her waitresses getting bad tips			2
' some @entity14 come in , they spend like $ 100 or $ 150 and they leave the wait staff maybe a $ 1 tip , ' she said			2
' it happens pretty often			0
i realize that the @entity14 think it 's discrimination , but on all the receipts it 's printed out on bottom : " we suggest an 18 or 20 percent tip. " ' visitors : the city of @entity2 has been encouraging tourists from @entity15 to visit @entity1 and spend their money ms @entity59 , who was born in @entity77 , said other foreigners are often lousy at leaving money for the wait staff			1
' @entity81 do it also			0
but it seems that @entity14 tip the worst , ' she said			0
@entity85 - @entity84 , who lives in a nearby town in @entity1 , first noticed the practice when she had dinner with her husband at @entity90 on @entity2			1
the two spent their dinner speaking @entity4 to each mother			0
ms @entity84 was born and raised in @entity28 , but has lived in the @entity94 for 30 years			0
when the bill came , it looked too steep , until she realized the waitress had included an 18 percent tip on top of the total for the meal			0
ms @entity84 protested and the server removed the surcharge			0
ms @entity84 says she left a 15 percent tip. the policies are discrimination , ms @entity84 says , because waiters are targeting anyone who they assume is n't @entity94			0
the problem likely arises from a cultural difference			0
in @entity14 and most countries , tipping 10 to 15 percent is customary , though many restaurants automatically include a gratuity on the bill			0
