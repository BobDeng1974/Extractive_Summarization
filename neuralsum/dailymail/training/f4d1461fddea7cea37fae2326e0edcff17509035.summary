in a dramatic escalation of the @entity10 ’s involvement in the @entity7 civil war , the prime minister will today give the green light for @entity10 officials to advise rebel commanders on the ground for the first time			1
officials say the talks are designed to help the opposition forces form one united rebel army to bring about regime change			2
but in a clear sign that he would like to go even further , mr @entity5 told the @entity28 that he is ‘ frustrated ’ by the @entity30 arms embargo on sending weapons to @entity32 , of which @entity10 is part			1
‘ we must ask ourselves , “ what more can we do to help the opposition ? ” , ’ he declared , adding that he is ‘ not currently planning to ’ supply arms to the rebels			0
‘ i am very frustrated we ca n’t do more , ’ he said during a trip to the @entity41			2
‘ this is an appalling slaughter			0
we must keep pushing , keep seeing what more can be done to hasten the political transition that ’s clearly needed			0
’ raising the stakes further , mr @entity5 said yesterday that president @entity6 would be offered a safe haven if he wants to flee the country – but not in @entity10			1
the prime minister visited the @entity50 capital @entity51 ahead of a trip today to a refugee camp on @entity50 ’s border with @entity32 , where thousands have fled the bloodshed , which has already cost 40,000 lives			1

@entity32 campaign manager @entity108 said : ' instead of talking about immunity deals for president @entity6 , @entity5 should be supporting efforts to ensure that he faces justice , ideally at the @entity113 at the @entity114			1
' after @entity7 government forces have indulged in a massive campaign of indiscriminate bombings , mass round - ups and torture , there should be no question of @entity6 escaping justice with a cosy deal of this kind			2
' the thousands of @entity7 who have lost relatives are entitled to and deserve credible justice , and president @entity6 and his commanders must be held to account for their brutal actions			2
mr @entity5 should use all of his influence to ensure that this happens			1
' the blodshed in @entity32 has lasted for some 18 months			0

mr @entity5 said : ‘ it is my job to get good deals for @entity10 , which means jobs in the @entity10 , investment in the @entity10 and make sure that we 're in the global race , but at the same time not compromising on our strong views about human rights , which we raise with all of these countries			1
‘ but let 's be clear , i came here to the @entity101 wanting the strongest possible long - term defence partnership between our two countries and that 's exactly what we 've agreed with @entity140 , and that is a very good outcome for both our countries and for jobs in the @entity10			2
‘ now when it comes to @entity167 , again this is a country that 's very important for our prosperity but it 's also important for our security too			0
as a full @entity173 member , we 'll both be discussing @entity32 , @entity174 , other regional issues that are vital to the future security of the @entity10			0
