few people expect @entity1 to go to @entity2 and overturn a 2 - 1 deficit from the first leg and reach the quarter - finals of the @entity5			1
but here 's 10 good reasons @entity9 's men should travel in hope ... 1 - @entity11 @entity12 were 2 - 1 down on aggregate to @entity2 and down to only 10 men in their second leg at the @entity16 in 2012 – and still went through			1
goals from @entity18 and @entity19 put @entity20 in control even before @entity22 was sent off			0
then , incredibly , @entity24 scored on the stroke of half - time and after surviving immense pressure , @entity23 scored to book @entity12 's place in the final , which they went on to win			0
@entity12 sealed a place in the 2012 @entity5 final by drawing 2 - 2 with @entity2 at the @entity16 2 - pellegrini can @entity32 @entity2 lost their last game at the @entity16 on february 21 to @entity34 , the team that @entity9 managed between 2010 and 2013			1
@entity9 will be able to get all the inside info on how they did it and also used to work with the winning goalscorer , @entity37			0
if @entity37 can slay @entity2 , there 's not reason why @entity40 ca n't follow suit			2
3 - no reason to fear @entity1 captain @entity45 knows what it feels like to score at the @entity16 , @entity44 saved a penalty from @entity49 three weeks ago and @entity50 won the @entity5 with @entity20 alongside the likes of @entity52 , @entity19 , @entity18 , @entity49 and @entity53			1
while the rest of the world regard @entity20 's players as demi - gods , @entity1 have been up against them before and shown they are human , or played with them			2
@entity44 saved a late @entity49 penalty to keep his side in with a chance of progressing to the next round 4 - @entity63 coach @entity64 wo n't be thanking @entity65 for the way they 've worked out their fixture list because an even bigger match lies in store on sunday when @entity20 meet @entity71 in a potential title decider			0
the temptation not to play at 100 per cent against @entity1 will be there particularly as they already hold a 2 - 1 advantage from the first leg			1
it will be up to @entity9 's side to take advantage if the @entity20 players have half an eye on the weekend			1
@entity2 boss @entity64 will have one eye on his side 's upcoming match against @entity71 5 - city best in adversity if there is one thing @entity1 have proved in recent times it 's that they should never be written off			1
they were eight points behind @entity92 with six games to play in 2012 – and won the title			0
in 2014 , they were three points behind @entity97 with three to play , and again came out on top			0
most significantly , they have shown ' bouncebackability ' in @entity101 too			0
they qualified from the group stages despite taking two points from their opening four matches and trailing 2 - 1 against @entity107 in their fifth match			1
@entity1 showed on the final day of the 2011 - 12 season that they are capable of springing a surprise 6 - prolific @entity111 @entity40 has scored six goals in six @entity5 ties this season , at a ratio of a goal every 76 minutes			1
if he scores again in the @entity16 , @entity1 will be halfway there to overturning the first - leg deficit			2
@entity9 believes @entity40 has the ability to be considered the third - best player in the world behind @entity49 and @entity121			0
a match - winning performance to rank alongside his hat - trick against @entity107 earlier in the tournament would go a long way to making that come true			0
@entity1 forward @entity40 ( he 's at the bottom ) has scored six goals in the @entity5 this season 7 - history on the side of @entity132 clubs it 's not impossible for @entity132 clubs not to be represented in the last eight of the @entity5 – but history shows it 's very rare			1
only once since 1996 have the quarter - finals taken place without a @entity139 team			0
with @entity97 , @entity12 and @entity141 gone , all hopes rest on @entity1 now			0
they have n't always been the most popular team since @entity144 's takeover but the club might thrive on the need to restore some national pride			0
@entity1 are @entity149 's last hope following @entity141 's exit from the @entity5 on tuesday 8 - all roads lead to @entity152 @entity9 has been criticised for rigidly sticking to 4 - 4 - 2 in @entity101 and being outplayed in midfield , as he was against @entity20 in the first leg			1
but when @entity40 was injured for the critical final group game away to @entity156 , he played @entity157 as a lone striker and @entity1 comfortably won 2 - 0			2
if @entity9 repeats the tactics – but with @entity40 replacing @entity157 – and @entity162 crowd @entity20 in the middle of the park , there 's no reason they should n't threaten the @entity167 with the talent they 've got in the team like @entity171			0
@entity172 playmaker @entity171 ( centre ) may be given the licence to roam if he plays behind @entity40 9 - managerial @entity175 - match @entity2 boss @entity64 is a @entity5 novice as a manager – this is his first campaign in the tournament and he 's never experienced a knockout second leg			2
in contrast @entity9 has guided @entity182 to the semi-final , @entity34 to the quarters and took @entity1 the @entity16 last season where they lost 2 - 1 with 10 men			1
the @entity186 knows what to expect – @entity64 does n't			0
@entity64 is a novice when it comes to managing a side in the @entity5 knockout stages @entity20 will attack - @entity64 10 - yaya motivation @entity50 is available for @entity1 are serving a three - match @entity194 ban and could n't be more motivated			1
for all the stealth of @entity2 's midfield with @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity19 , they have n't got the power to live with @entity50 if he is allowed to run at them			2
the @entity201 international has proved he 's a big - match player – remember his incredible goal at @entity204 in last season 's @entity205 final – and this could be his defining match in a @entity1 shirt			2
@entity50 is available for selection after missing the first leg against his former side through suspension @entity215 here 's three reasons why @entity1 should be fearful of @entity2			1

@entity1 face @entity2 at the @entity16 in @entity5
@entity9 's must overturn a 2 - 1 deficit to qualify for next round
@entity1 have to score at least two goals
@entity1 ace @entity50 can face his former side after serving suspension
