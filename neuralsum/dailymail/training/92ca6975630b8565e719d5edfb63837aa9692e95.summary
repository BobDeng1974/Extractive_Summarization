' an a-bomb ! from @entity2 : @entity2 watches his towering home run sail over the fence friday night the honeymoon ended quickly : what started out so promising , quickly became acrimonious as @entity2 's personal life soon became a major distraction for the team not everyone is convinced : a fan holds a sign that reads " @entity219 , " while @entity2 signs autographs before a friday rehab game for @entity218 @entity217 been there , done that : fans have been holding up signs labeling the beleaguered player a cheater for years , this sign is being held up by a fan in @entity228 during the 2009 @entity229			1
