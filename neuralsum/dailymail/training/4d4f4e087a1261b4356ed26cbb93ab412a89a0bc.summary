a headteacher who introduced a policy of handing out razor blades to a pupil so they could self harm ' safely ' at school has been cleared of misconduct			1
@entity7 , the former head of @entity9 - a specialist school in @entity11 for children with @entity14 ’s syndrome and ‘ higher functioning autism ’ - was investigated after whistleblowers at the school alerted the authorities			1
however a disciplinary panel of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) has now cleared @entity20 of unacceptable professional conduct			1
@entity7 introduced a policy of handing out razor blades to a pupil at @entity9 , pictured , in @entity25 , @entity11 , so they could self harm			1
she has been cleared of of unacceptable professional conduct the panel heard how the headteacher allowed a ‘ controlled self - harm ’ policy at the school in @entity25 , in a bid to control the behaviour of a single pupil , referred to as @entity35 , who had a history of self harming			1
just six days after the policy was launched a number of whistleblowers at the school raised concerns - saying they were worried the pupil could accidentally kill themselves - and the policy was scrapped by the headteacher			2
the panel heard how the pupil was given a ‘ sterile disposable razor blade ’ and was allowed in a room by themselves so they could ‘ self harm ’ - with a teacher checking in on them every five - 10 minutes			1
when the pupil had finished , teachers would dress and clean the wounds			2
just six days after the ' controlled self harm ' policy was launched at @entity9 , pictured , a number of whistleblowers at the school raised concerns - saying they were worried the pupil could kill themselves a spokeswoman for the @entity66 , which is responsible for running the school , said last year that it was a ‘ short term procedure ’ in the ‘ best interests of the pupil ’ after it was introduced in january 2012			2
@entity70 , a former child support worker at the school , told the panel this week that he had raised concerns that the pupil ‘ could bleed to death in as little as two minutes if an artery was cut ’			2
but the @entity19 panel this week found that the former head - who left the school after her botched policy came to light in march last year - was not guilty of unacceptable professional conduct			1
the panel ruled that the ‘ controlled self harm policy ’ was ill - advised and ‘ badly thought out ’ , but that it came about because of ‘ failings in communication ’ between school chiefs and a ‘ lack of experience ’ of miss @entity7 ’s part			1
when the pupil had finished using the razor , teachers would dress and clean the wounds , a disciplinary panel of the @entity19 heard ( file picture ) @entity95 , the chair of the panel , said that miss @entity7 was responsible for the policy , saying that she had told them ‘ @entity35 ’s behaviour was becoming an increasing cause for concern ’			1
he said that @entity20 ‘ failed to follow best practices ’ due to her lack of experience and her keenness to help @entity106 he told the panel : ' she said that she wo n’t make the same mistake again and the panel accepts this			0
' the school principal @entity111 and general manager @entity112 were both cleared of any involvement in the policy			0
a spokesman for the @entity66 , which runs the school , said : ' the company notes the decision of the @entity19			0
' @entity119 , founder of parenting website @entity121 said : ' children who self harm need intense help and support - but this sends out the wrong signals			1
' having an adult in a position of authority not only condone your actions but assist you in them could make children think the behaviour is normal and not a danger to them			0
' while the clearly teacher felt she was acting in the child 's best interests , it may show that specialists in this area need more training and guidance			0
' @entity145 harm is a cry for help and shows kids are not coping			0
' they need love and care to get to the root of their issues , not a razor blade to slash open their skin			0
' a spokesperson from charity @entity158 said when the policy was revealed last year : ' the issue of controlled self - harm has proven to be effective in some areas , but only under the correct supervision			2
' self - harm is sometimes the safest option for a young person - if they ’re using self - harm to make life a bit easier to manage , then taking it away from them without replacing it with something else can actually bring on a desperate kind of depression that could make them slide from self - harm to having suicidal ideation			0
' i ’d rather someone be self - harming in a way they can manage as safely as possible than be left stranded with no way to cope and be thinking about more desperate measures			0
' in essence , it ’s not possible to say that it ’s a right or wrong approach to dealing with self - harm in young people - that judgment comes down to how it ’s being supported , the policies in place and the point at which someone is deemed appropriate to engage in such a programme			0
' i ’d be horrified if a school was trying to manage such a scheme , but open - minded to an appropriate residential facility implementing it as one of many care pathways			0
