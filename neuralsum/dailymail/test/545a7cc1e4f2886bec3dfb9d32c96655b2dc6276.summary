@entity0 is renowned as the playground of the rich and famous			1
it is a melting pot of decadence in the @entity4 with year - round sunshine , some of the best hotels on the planet , and shopping opportunities to seriously damage the credit card			1
despite the restrictions of local religious laws , the champagne - fuelled party life has come to somewhat define @entity0 as a holiday destination			2
@entity0 : it 's still ' bling ' but the natural habitat of the mega-wealthy has a developing cultural underside because of this , i have always regarded this @entity23 state as the natural habitat for the types of mega-wealthy who like to splash their cash ; @entity30 footballers , nightclub owners , rappers and reality tv stars - the @entity34 and the cast of @entity36 will continue to flock to @entity0			1
so i was surprised to discover that @entity0 has a rapidly developing cultural underside			2
in recent times , the place has attracted more unlikely visitors - a-listers including @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			2
@entity41 was guest of honour at the recent @entity47 , following in the footsteps of the @entity49 - winning ms @entity42 , who attended in 2013			2
@entity43 was in town in november with @entity52 's @entity51 to perform at @entity0 's first - ever @entity53 at the @entity54			1
and although @entity43 was ordered to censor her lyrics - ' they told me to cover up and not swear ! ' she announced on stage - punters said the relaxed atmosphere , cool crowd and outdoor , grassy setting made the festival feel like @entity0 's answer to @entity63			1
@entity43 performed at @entity0 's first @entity64 there is now the annual @entity66			1
this year , @entity67 and @entity68 performed in february			2
and work is also under way to build @entity0 's first opera house in @entity73 area			1
the 2,500 - seat venue is anticipated to be complete in 2017			2
@entity44 showed his @entity76 collection in @entity0 , while @entity45 decamped from @entity77 to launch her shoe collection in @entity79 of the @entity80 in december			2
and with @entity83 shopping meccas @entity81 and @entity84 now established , and @entity88 emporium @entity86 on the cards to open in the next few years , the retail scene also caters for more sophisticated customers			1
according to @entity92 , deputy editor of fashion magazine @entity94 , there is even an underground fashion scene emerging in the city 's industrial area , @entity99			1
' it has pop - up fashion shops and cool @entity0 designers , ' says @entity103			2
' there really is another shopping side to @entity0 , away from the malls			2
' there are also several trendy art galleries in this area			1
so why the sudden cultural shift ? two things seem to have happened in recent times			0
firstly the party scene has relocated an hour down the road to @entity116 , thanks in part to the launch of the @entity120 and @entity121 ( the world 's first theme park devoted to the @entity124 motors )			1
second , @entity0 was also recently made host to the global @entity129 , an honour of which it is very proud			0
the government is pumping millions into creating the infrastructure for the global mega-event			0
so @entity0 has upped its game , and with great results			0
now art , music and fashion events are near - weekly fixtures on the calendar			1
of course , all this has not stopped the partying - there 's just a more sophisticated crowd of revellers			1
branches of @entity83 nightclubs lead the way , starting with @entity149 's most famous one , @entity148			1
art exhibitions are on the rise such as the @entity153 art gallery in @entity99 district in @entity155 ( above ) since the club opened its doors in @entity160 three years ago , @entity156 and @entity157 have arrived too			1
do the clubs worry about @entity116 stealing their party crown and cliental ? apparently not			0
the general consensus is that @entity116 has a lot to learn from @entity0			0
indeed , @entity148 recently took the party to @entity116 - and arguably the greatest vip guest of all , prince @entity168			0
in november the nightclub hosted a pop - up venue on a yacht for the @entity120 , and , of course , the party - loving @entity168 could n't resist sinking a few rum cocktails on board			0
but when it comes to hotels , @entity0 has always been ahead			0
i was lucky enough to stay at the world - famous @entity179			0
world famous : the @entity182 towers over the malls and souks of @entity0 not only did my visit coincide with the @entity23 's @entity187 , it was also the architecturally unique hotel 's 15th birthday			1
i have never seen a fireworks display and laser show like it			0
i was completely bowled over by the world - class level of service at the suite - only hotel , and even had my own butler on hand for the duration of the stay			0
the @entity204 restaurant , in the perpendicular pod that juts from the side of the building on the 27th floor , not only served the most exquisite fish , but the bartender made a mean martini too			0
it 's little wonder the hotel that prides itself as ' the world 's most luxurious ' has a regular roll - call of royalty and a-listers staying			1
many arrive by helicopter , landing on the helipad perched on top of the sail			0
apparently it is used nearly every day			0
i had to slum it with a chauffeur driven @entity222 picking me up at the airport			0
i 'll be sure to book the chopper next time ... the @entity226 package costs from £ 2,850 per couple and includes two nights ' b&b in a two - floor suite ( minimum stay two nights ) , with private butler , dinner both evenings at @entity179 's signature restaurant , massages and set of @entity239 amenities			1
visit jumeirah.com or email @entity240			0
@entity242 ( ba.com ) offers return flights from @entity244 to @entity0 from £ 537 .			0
