mapping the nation 's honesty : people in @entity8 are by far the most dishonest in @entity9 , while their cousins in @entity12 and @entity13 are basically saints but only eight in 10 beverage guzzlers in the nation 's capital paid for their tea , while the other 20 per cent of people skipped out on the minimal amount			1
@entity8 's wise words : ' i hope i shall possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what i consider the most enviable of all titles , the character of an honest man ' the other states where you should hold on to your purse were @entity40 where only 85 per cent of participants paid for their tea , followed by @entity42 and @entity43 at 87 per cent			2
in comparison , everyone in @entity12 and @entity13 paid up without exception			1
@entity47 and @entity48 followed closely behind , with some 99 per cent proving to be honest , according to the company 's fifth annual test			0
this year , however , was the first year every state has been represented			0
unlike the city that shares its name , @entity52 seemed to honor it 's founding @entity56 's sentiment , scoring 96 per cent â€” considerably higher than the national average of 92 per cent			0
' even though my bicycle was stolen the same day as our @entity8 experiment , it 's reassuring to know that 92 per cent of @entity9 will do the right thing even when it seems no one is watching , ' @entity14 co-founder @entity58 said			2
@entity66 ranked in the middle of the pack at 91 per cent , which was better than people expected			0
@entity71 tied with @entity72 , with a score of 96 per cent			0

most honest : people in @entity12 , pictured , and @entity13 were the most honest of all @entity9 according to the informal tea test unlike last year where redheads were most honest , in 2013 blondes were the most likely to pay , scoring 95 per cent , followed by brunettes , at 93 per cent and then redheads at 92 per cent			1
people with short hair were 91 per cent honest , vs. people with medium and long hair who were 93 per cent and 94 per cent honest , respectively			2
people in groups tended to be more honest than people on their own , perhaps because they were bullied by their friends .			2
