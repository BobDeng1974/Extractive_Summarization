@entity1 manager @entity0 is pushing ahead with the signing of @entity4 ’s £ 20million midfielder , @entity3 , as he devises a strategy to win the @entity6 next season with just 21 players			1
@entity0 plans to base his next @entity10 campaign around the @entity11 — one of the best holding midfielders in the world — after accepting that the team need to tighten up following three successive @entity6 failures			2
city are determined that friday ’s punishment by @entity20 for breaking @entity18 rules , consisting of a heavy fine and squad restrictions , will not alter their ambitions for next season			2
’ @entity20 ’s stance will force @entity1 into difficult decisions over who to leave out , although a senior club source said : ‘ there will be no change in transfer strategy			0
’ that means @entity3 , @entity4 team - mate @entity26 and @entity52 ’s @entity51 are still expected to sign this summer			1
@entity53 and @entity54 may be sold to raise funds , while a number of @entity58 players , including @entity60 - bound @entity59 , are considering their futures because of a lack of first - team opportunities			1
@entity59 ’s contract talks have stalled as he enters the final year of his current deal			2
@entity3 , 26 , is regarded as a particularly important acquisition by @entity0 , who privately acknowledged after the club ’s @entity6 exit to @entity69 last season that he might have to be more cautious in big games to succeed against @entity20 ’s elite			1
@entity0 ’s plan is to use @entity3 as a defensive midfield player , allowing @entity75 and @entity76 to play ahead of him			1
that would mean @entity1 playing with just one striker in a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 system for some @entity10 games , leaving @entity81 in danger of missing out altogether on @entity1 ’s reduced @entity6 squad			0
despite a £ 1billion investment in @entity1 since 2008 , the club ’s @entity85 owners have yet to see them reach the quarter - finals of the @entity6 , despite twice winning the @entity89			0
@entity20 ’s sanctions pose difficult problems as @entity1 plan for next season			0
in addition to the £ 49m fine — £ 33m of which is suspended — and @entity10 squad restrictions , @entity1 must not increase their wage bill and can not spend more than £ 49m net in this transfer window			0
whatever questions are thrown at @entity1 , however , @entity0 believes @entity3 is the answer because of his willingness to help protect the defence at all times			1
leaving : @entity53 is another who may make way with city 's reduced budget options : @entity59 may leave in search of more first - team football the 6ft 1in player has twice before been close to coming to the @entity89			1
@entity115 boss @entity114 applied for and received a work permit for him on deadline day last summer only for the move to break down when @entity4 failed to sign a replacement			2
@entity1 then tried to sign @entity3 in january in a double deal with @entity26 but failed to agree a fee with their @entity123 club			1
@entity3 ’s new contract has a £ 20m buy - out clause			2
however , his impending arrival will have a knock - on effect with @entity1 ’s @entity58 players growing increasingly disenchanted about their lack of game time			0
city need eight home - grown players if they name the full allocation of 25 allowed for their @entity89 squad			0
wanted : @entity52 defender @entity51 is wanted by a number of clubs , including @entity1 gone : @entity138 will definitely leave after his contract expired they have already lost @entity138 , whose contract has run out , and @entity59 is in no hurry to negotiate his new deal			1
the 28 - year - old was disappointed to be left out of their team for the @entity147 final and the final @entity89 game of the season against @entity150 , when they clinched the title			0
@entity1 would love @entity59 to stay because of his versatility — a stance that will surely only harden following @entity20 ’s ruling — and the lack of top @entity58 players good enough for their squad			1
if @entity59 refuses to renew his deal , they could either sell him this summer or hold him to the final year to make up their home - grown quota but lose him for nothing in 12 months ’ time			1
sidelined : @entity162 is interesting @entity163 and has just 12 months left on his current deal desperate : @entity165 ( right ) might also leave as he barely played last season despite being fit defender @entity162 , who interests @entity163 , is in a similar position			1
@entity169 has 12 months left on his contract but will not sign a new one having spent most of last season on the sidelines			0
midfielder @entity165 , 23 , is also desperate for games			0
he was hardly used by @entity0 despite being fit for virtually the entire campaign and missed any chance of being in @entity176 ’s @entity60 squad as a result			0
@entity59 , @entity169 and @entity165 had only 15 @entity89 starts between them last season — 12 of those by @entity59			2
@entity179 midfielder @entity53 will be allowed to leave as @entity1 are not permitted more than 17 overseas players aged over 21 in their @entity89 squad .			0

@entity0 pushing ahead with top targets despite @entity18 sanctions
@entity4 *duo* @entity3 and @entity26 and @entity51 top list
city may be forced to sell @entity53 and @entity54 to fund moves
@entity138 already departed but @entity59 , @entity165 and @entity162 considering their options after lack of first - team action
