huge salaries and lavish expenses are allowing members of the @entity4 to live like ‘ latter - day roman senators ’ , a report warned yesterday			0
the shocking study found that cosseted @entity7 now have incomes up to 20 times higher than the people they represent			1
while millions of families across @entity13 have had their incomes squeezed , most meps have enjoyed large increases in their salaries – while continuing to vote through ever - higher budgets for the @entity18			2
@entity7 in @entity19 from the member nations earn £ 137million a year before allowances and expenses the study found that @entity7 now enjoy an average income of £ 182,826 including allowances for attendance and travel			1
the figure is almost ten times higher than the average @entity18 wage of £ 18,617 a year			2
it is also 695 per cent higher than the average @entity32 salary of £ 23,000			2
the biggest discrepancy is in @entity34 , where the average wage is just £ 8,500 – less than a twentieth of the salary of an mep			2
over a five - year term @entity7 now have an income approaching £ 1million			1
the report , by the @entity43 website @entity41 , estimates it would take the average @entity34 108 years to earn the same sum			0
the @entity18 project has been rocked by a series of scandals unlike mps in this country , @entity7 still vote on their own salaries and perks			1
until 2010 they received the same salary as an mp in their own country – equal to £ 65,738 in this country , but just £ 9,046 in @entity34			0
but at that point they decided to ‘ equalise ’ salaries based on those of the best - paid countries , @entity43 and @entity60			0
the decision has led to most meps getting a huge boost in income at a time when their own citizens have been suffering as a result of the recession			0
@entity7 like @entity69 earn about 200 per cent more than @entity49 , according to the research the report says the situation is reminiscent of ancient @entity73 , adding : ‘ the survey results show the huge income disparities between the @entity18 citizens battered by the economic crisis and their @entity18 parliamentarians , concluding with one thesis only ; we are dealing in @entity19 and some national parliaments of the @entity18 countries with conditions similar to ancient @entity73 , because just like in the former @entity84 none of these “ new class @entity18 senators ” are controlled in any way			1
‘ the extreme differences in pay structure between politicians and citizens are very serious			0
‘ there is at least as much need for discussion on this issue as on the @entity18 ’s plan to cap the manager salaries of public companies			0
’ the salaries and allowances of the @entity7 of the 27 @entity18 states now total £ 137million			1
but this does not include the cost of the £ 217,000 office allowance available to each mep			1
the report also looks at some of the extraordinary perks available to mps in some national parliaments			0
in @entity60 , mps are allowed to claim expenses for haircuts , while @entity114 mps get 240 litres of petrol a month			1
the revelations will add to concern about the cost of the @entity4 , which maintains expensive legislatures in both @entity19 and @entity120 but still has relatively few real powers , except over the @entity18 budget where it has repeatedly voted for above - inflation increases .			0

@entity7 perks receive free haircuts and *52* *gallons* of petrol a month
their salaries cost £ 137million a month but do not include allowances
research finds @entity136 meps earn *740* *%* more than average @entity136 citizen
