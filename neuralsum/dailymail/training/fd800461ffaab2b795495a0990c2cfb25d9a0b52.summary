@entity1 blokes are renowned worldwide for their no - nonsense masculinity			0
but take another very close at that spunky bloke at the bar , because his new - found confidence may be thanks to his syringe - wielding cosmetic practitioner			0
as well as having his accountant , gym instructor , and barber on speed - dial it appears the modern - day @entity1 macho man is a closet metrosexual , suggested by the rise in injectable muscle relaxants like @entity20 toxin , otherwise known as @entity21 and its cousins @entity23 and @entity23			1
@entity24 , practice manager for @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , says , ' bro - tox is on the increase as men are no longer embarrassed about calling or coming into the clinic to find out how they can improve their looks '			1
before and after : @entity34 from @entity27 turns to @entity21 to try and eradicate he deep - set wrinkles he inherited from his father smooth the frowns away : @entity38 client @entity34 turned to ' @entity28 ' to eradicate his inherited lines ' the number of male clients has definitely risen over the past few years and anti-wrinkle injections have become our most popular treatment for men , counting for about 20 % of our clients , ' she said			1
' in the run - up to @entity50 the figure is even higher because we offer lay - by , so we have a lot of younger men who usually could n't afford it coming in			2
' when @entity38 opened in 1988 its clients were 99 % female , apart from men who were being treated for skin disorders			1
but because @entity21 is now widely spoken about and seen as acceptable - and celebrities like @entity58 and @entity59 , have praised its effects - ms @entity24 says the stigma has been removed			1
smooth as a baby 's bottom : unlike his earlier days , @entity58 is a now a full member of the ' @entity28 ' club the procedure takes just a few minutes so can be performed discreetly in a lunch hour , and because it can take up to two weeks for the drug to take effect , it 's not a dramatic sudden change			1
' our male clients used to have treatments like laser for pigmentation or sun damage , ' ms @entity24 adds			1
' but nowadays men , like their female counterparts , do n't want to look their age , and are proactive about doing something about it			2
' often women who attend the clinic will bring the husband in for a treatment , ' she continues , ' and although there are lots of male skincare products out there , muscle relaxants are more effective and provide a quick fix with no downtime			1
1 ) to reduce gummy smiles 2 ) relaxing the corners of the mouth ( sad lines ) 3 ) dimpled chin 4 ) excessive sweating 5 ) reducing pore size when tradie @entity34 , 38 , from @entity99 , who has inherited lines across his forehead from his dad , noticed the wrinkles were getting deeper and beginning to age him , he turned to @entity38 for help			1
doctor @entity106 had already cured @entity34 's bruxism ( teeth grinding causing headache and jaw soreness ) using muscle relaxants so because he knew the staff he did n't feel so awkward asking for the ' girly ' procedure			1
' i was embarrassed as it 's a bit girly , ' he said			2
' but the lines were making me look older than 38 and i was beginning to feel really self - conscious			0
my female friends said it stops more wrinkles forming so i bit the bullet and made the appointment			0
' i panicked initially and began to regret it in case it was really obvious but two weeks later , my lines have reduced and softened and – most importantly – i still look like me , ' he said			0
fake it ' till you make it : @entity21 is the secret women for many women with clear , line - free complexions ' if i looked like the @entity135 or worse my mates would never let me live it down , ' he laughed			2
' i 've had a few people saying i look relaxed and asking if i 've been on holiday but no one has twigged yet			0
' i love the results and will definitely be having a top - up when it starts to wear off			0
' dr @entity38 , who treats a number of celebrities , says that her male customers are from all walks of life , and reels off tradies , salesmen , doctors and media - executives as the majority			1
' men see @entity28 as an investment in their career and their life as it boosts confidence and self - esteem , ' she said			0
