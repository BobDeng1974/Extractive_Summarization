from elaborate hats to colourful coats and skyscraper heels , this week 's @entity0 has proved as memorable for its fashion as it has for the drama unfolding on the course			1
but today , racing fans were left shivering in their flimsy frocks as the heavens opened and gave everyone a soaking			1
luckily , most had come prepared with umbrellas , turning the racecourse into a sea of bright colour as the brollies were unfurled			0
beneath them were racegoers dressed in an array of colourful ensembles , with some braving the downpour in bare legs and spike heels while trying desperately to keep their elaborate titfers dry			0
more still , perhaps with an eye to the weather rather than fashion , shucked off their finery and replaced it with waterproof cagoules			0
despite the downpours , most of the men and women arriving for the final day of racing action managed to look cheerful - perhaps with the prospect of seeing veteran jockey @entity73 compete in the final @entity74 of his career in mind			1
@entity73 , who has won the prestigious trophy no fewer than five times during his 20 - year career , will compete for the final time aboard the hotly - tipped @entity82 bay gelding , @entity83			0
' it 's impossible to not back @entity73 's last ever ride in the @entity74 , ' comments @entity86 's @entity85			2
' it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20 - time champion jockey			0
back again : @entity91 returned for the fourth day in a row and looked chic in her brown wool coat by @entity82 designer , @entity94 good look : the @entity97 's granddaughter opted for a striking @entity99 cocktail hat topped with traditional pheasant feathers family outing : @entity91 was later joined by her mother @entity102 and her husband @entity103 enjoying their day : @entity91 and @entity103 enjoy a chat during their day out at @entity0 in a row close : @entity91 gives her mother @entity102 a kiss on the cheek ( left ) and right , @entity91 and @entity103 pay close attention to the action @entity91 and @entity103 share a joke with their friend as they look through the programme the progress of the race can be tracked by @entity91 's expression , from contemplative to anxious then resigned to defeat ... but she seemed happy with the end result , centre , while @entity103 was also in high spirits , right making an entrance : princess @entity102 arrived at @entity0 having spent the morning at a service for soldiers in @entity127 @entity102 was pictured cheering passionately during the race the royal was gripped by the action and cheered and clapped as the horses races past their seats @entity102 appears to be celebrating as she punches the air after the race day out : a beaming @entity138 star @entity137 arrived hand - in - hand with husband @entity136 ' @entity140 might be the heavily backed favourite , yet there 's still question marks whether he can finally make it third time lucky at @entity0 , but for the old romantics there 's only one man that can win this year 's @entity74 , and it 's @entity73			1
' also on hand to see @entity73 compete in his final @entity74 was @entity91 who arrived looking glamorous in a brown wool coat by @entity82 designer @entity94 and sporting a chic cocktail hat decorated with traditional pheasant feathers			2
@entity91 's appearance made it a full four out of four for the @entity97 's granddaughter , who made her first visit to the racecourse on tuesday where she saw her and husband @entity103 's horse @entity161 fail to deliver and take a lowly 14th place in his race			2
she reappeared for a second time on @entity166 and opted for another @entity94 ensemble , this time a black and grey checked coat and a detailed black cocktail hat			0
for the second day in a row , she spent most of her time watching the action unfold from the grandstand and chose not to join her aunt , the @entity175 , in her private box			0
today saw @entity91 joined for the event by her mother @entity102 , who arrived in the early afternoon having come direct from a service held to honour the fallen of @entity180 at @entity181			1
splash of colour : brightly dressed racegoers ensured the final day of @entity0 was n't without colour braving the rain : a lady in a wonderful crimson hat and matching scarf brandishes her umbrella as she arrives messy ! a lady braves the rain in a pair of white jeans and an elegant fur - trimmed eau - de - nil coat having fun : racing fans , among them @entity198 and his wife ( left ) , appeared to be enjoying their day in spite of the rain a tale of two racegoers : while some opted for practical boots and raincoats , others chose flimsy frocks and high - heeled sandals sensible : the vast majority chose to strike a balance between the two extremes and teamed their heeled shoes with trousers staying dry : a lady arrives wearing a pack - a - mac while others are forced to shelter beneath copies of the @entity220 stepping out for the final time : @entity73 prepares to mount his horse ahead of the first race of the day , the @entity225 @entity224 @entity226 weather : racegoers enjoy a chat beside the empty parade ring as the final day of the @entity0 gets underway dreary : after three beautiful days of sunshine , the heavens opened as racegoers arrived for the final day of @entity0 wet : despite the awful weather , racegoers carrying bright umbrellas livened up the scene courtesy of colourful brollies			1

temperatures took a turn for the worse as the final day of the @entity0 got underway this morning
@entity91 and @entity137 were among the racegoers waiting to see the biggest race of the week , the @entity74
princess @entity102 was also at the races and went straight there after attending a service at @entity181 's in @entity127
