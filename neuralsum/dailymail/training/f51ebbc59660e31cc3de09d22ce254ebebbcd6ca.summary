for most of its working life it was most commonly seen thousands of feet in the air , transporting jet - setters to all corners of the world			1
but this decommissioned @entity8 jumbo jet ended up causing travel misery today as it crawled down the motorway behind a police escort			1
the front section and cockpit of the ' @entity8 ' made its way from @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , down the @entity19 dual carriageway between @entity20 and @entity21			1
the disused plane will eventually be put back together on a site in @entity24 to provide a studio for interior design university students			1
weighing 60 - tonnes , the aircraft measures 22 feet wide , 16ft 3ins high and is 137ft long			1
the fuselage and other parts of a @entity8 is transported along the @entity30 flanked by an ' abnormal load escort vehicle ' the disused aircraft on the back of a lorry takes up the whole of a narrow country lane as it makes its way into @entity20 the abnormally large load took up two lanes of the motorway as it travelled from @entity15 via @entity40 and onto @entity24 a lorry transporting a decommissioned @entity8 jumbo jet crawls along the @entity19 near @entity21 causing congestion on the roads following a police escort , the front section and cockpit of the jumbo jet were transported down the @entity19 causing a long tailback police cars drove either side of the disused @entity8 as it slowly made its way through @entity17 as part of a massive logistical effort the @entity8 aircraft left the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , at 7am and will be transported to @entity24 the disused plane will eventually be put back together on a site in @entity24 to provide a studio for interior design university students a man and child watch on as the abnormally large load attempts a right turn as it leaves the airport in the early hours this morning the decommissioned @entity8 caused further travel misery ( pictured on @entity30 ) on the same day as two major crashes on the @entity64 and @entity65 the aircraft left the @entity15 at 7am today and will head north to @entity20 , then south east heading north up the @entity67 through @entity17			1
it will then be driven to @entity69 , before arriving at the @entity24 site where it will be converted into a unique studio for interior design students @entity73 , director of quality and business at the academy , said the old plane had deliberately been chosen for a venue for the students to work in because it would provide a challenging and creative environment for them			1
she said : ' it 's much cheaper than putting up a building			2
we are really going to prepare them for the world of work			0
' they 're not going to sit in a lecture theatre , they 're going to be totally in the design practice			2
' they will work there for 45 weeks a year and learn how to design venues			2
' police warned the abnormally large loads were likely to cause considerable disruption to motorists			0
a spokesman for @entity101 police said			0
' due to the size of these transporters they will be slow moving and will have the potential to create congestion			0
' wherever possible disruption will be kept to a minimum but hauliers and motorists are asked to please be patient if they come across this load			0
' anyone travelling over this period to catch a flight or meet appointments should allow sufficient additional time			0
' please be aware that once on the @entity19 these loads will be slow moving and take up the entire southbound carriageways			0
' regular updates and travel information in respect of this abnormal load will be passed from our control room at @entity127 when appropriate to help motorists plan their journey			0
' the transfer of the aircraft will add to the travel misery this @entity132			2
it comes as two major crashes , on the @entity64 near @entity135 in @entity136 and the @entity65 near @entity137 in @entity138 , caused long tailbacks			1
the @entity8 is a wide - body commercial airliner and cargo transport aircraft , often referred to by its original nickname , @entity8 , or @entity8			1
its iconic ' hump ' upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft make it among the world 's most recognizable aircraft			2
first flown commercially in 1970 , the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years			0
the 747 is to be replaced by the @entity151 ( part of the @entity153 ) in the future .			0

decommissioned @entity8 jumbo jet made its way from @entity15 in @entity17 to @entity24
disused plane will be put back together on a site in @entity24 to provide a studio for interior design students
the aircraft , weighing 60 - tonnes and measuring 22 feet wide , 16ft 3ins high and 137ft long , caused *traffic* chaos
