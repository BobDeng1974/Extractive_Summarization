the most exciting all - round talent in @entity1 and perhaps world women ’s cricket was born in @entity4 and played football in a @entity7 youth league before finally taking up the game that would make her name			1
that most cosmopolitan of upbringings was the result of her mother working for the foreign office			0
but @entity17 is very much a product of @entity19 , @entity20 and an ever expanding @entity1 set - up			1
now she is at the forefront of a group of young players , which includes @entity26 and @entity27 , who will carry the flag for a professional @entity30 team as they attempt to establish cricket as the no 1 choice for elite sportswomen			1
@entity34 , or @entity17 , @entity17 was born in @entity4 and played football in a @entity7 youth league before taking up cricket @entity38 , @entity30 ’s long - serving and outstanding captain , is still the face of women ’s cricket			1
but it is the new breed who will determine the long - term profile of the @entity1 game , not least the engaging @entity17			1
@entity17 , 22 , is a batting all - rounder good enough as a seam bowler to take a hat - trick in a @entity46 international against @entity48			1
crucially , she is as powerful a striker of a ball as any woman in world cricket			2
significant investment in the women ’s game has seen the @entity30 team make great strides , but one of the biggest criticisms of them has been their lack of real strength , a failing summed up by their inability to regularly clear the ropes			1
that is where @entity17 comes in			2
when she played tennis she struggled to keep the ball in play and when she plays golf she regularly drives the ball as far as most men			0
most importantly , she can give a cricket ball a real whack			2
the 22 - year - old considers her powerful striking of the ball to be one of her best strengths ‘ i ’d like to think i ’m the biggest hitter around , ’ said @entity17 coyly during one of @entity30 ’s regular training sessions at @entity85			1
‘ we ’ve put quite a bit of emphasis on powerful striking , not necessarily hitting sixes , but everyone has been working hard on the technique of that			0
‘ it ’s one of my strengths which i want to use in a game more often			2
‘ when i played tennis i could n’t keep the ball in the court but luckily there are no restrictions in cricket			0
i guess i ’m naturally strong			0
’ strength is what @entity30 need			2
they have led the way in many of the improvements in the women ’s game but their lack of collective power was summed up by the fact that they did not hit a single six between them in the @entity46 in @entity117 in march and april			2
‘ the game is moving forward so quickly that this was always something we ’d need to work on , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ you ca n’t stand still			0
‘ women ’s cricket is getting more and more competitive and we have to keep up			2
@entity17 celebrates taking a wicket against @entity124 during the @entity126 semi-final in @entity117 ‘ we ’ve taken a bit of baseball , both the technique and using the whole body , and it ’s something we ’ve been working on for a few months			2
‘ it ’s hard to tell how far i can hit it now because i ’ve only got the hall at @entity85 to go by but it ’s something i want and need to take into games			0
’ it has been quite a journey for @entity17 to where we are now , at the @entity138 at @entity85 where she has studied for the last three - and - a - half years and now shares a house with four other @entity30 cricketers			1
she spent the first two years of her life in @entity144 before a brief return to @entity30 and then a prolonged spell in @entity147 which saw her family based in @entity149 as well as @entity7			2
@entity17 played football competitively and tried her hand at other sports before settling on cricket when returning home for good at 14			1
‘ it has been brilliant , ’ she says of her cricketing conversion			0
‘ my dad played at school and university and every summer after he left @entity160 he would have this weekend where he would get back together with his mates and play			0
next on the agenda for @entity17 is a tour of @entity48 , while another @entity166 series awaits @entity30 ’s women ‘ i used to go along with him and join in but they did n’t like it when a girl got them out ! ‘ so i started properly at @entity173 because it was the only club with a women ’s section near where i lived and i was lucky enough to have a @entity176 coach			1
i was put forward for a trial and i went through the county system			0
’ she made her @entity30 debut just 18 months ago but has already become a key performer in all formats , while cricket became her career in may when the @entity138 took the momentous step of making the elite players full - time			1
next on the agenda for @entity17 is february ’s tour of @entity48 , while another @entity166 series awaits @entity30 ’s women as well as men this summer			1
‘ professional contracts have been a huge step not just for women ’s cricket but women ’s sport , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ we ’re standing on our own two feet which is really nice and there ’s more and more development through the pathways and grass - roots			0
it ’s growing all the time and it ’s a really exciting time to be involved			0
as well as working on her hitting , @entity17 wants to get faster with the ball - closer to the 75mph mark ‘ it has made everyone a bit more competitive and the battle for places is brilliant			1
you have more time to work on the game rather than having to work , too			0
i ’ve got six months left on my studies [ she is doing a sports and exercise studies degree ] and have been balancing cricket and uni for a while now			0
@entity85 have been very accommodating and i ’ve sat exams in @entity117 and @entity221 among other places			0
’ as well as working on her hitting , @entity17 wants to get faster with the ball and hopes to move towards the sort of speeds , 75 miles per hour plus , that have made her house - mate , @entity229 , @entity30 ’s fastest bowler			1
‘ i ’ve been playing in the @entity30 set up for a year - and - a - half now and hopefully this is n’t it yet , ’ she said			1
‘ it has gone pretty well			0
i have n’t had a down spell yet but , touch wood , the only way is up			0
’ she is certainly one to watch .			0
