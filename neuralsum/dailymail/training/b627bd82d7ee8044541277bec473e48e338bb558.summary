by @entity0 @entity1 has refused to be drawn into any mind games with @entity3 as his @entity5 side prepare to do battle with @entity7 this season			1
the @entity9 knows @entity3 well from mentoring him at @entity10 , but insists he wo n't react to any wind - ups from the @entity12			1
asked if he was looking forward to facing old pal @entity3 , @entity13 said : ' no. i play against @entity7			1
my team and his team are playing against each other			0
since his arrival on @entity27 shores in 2004 , the @entity12 has dragged players , referees and opposition managers into his web of mind - games			1
and he did n't let his guard slip after returning to @entity7 last summer , either			1
already the @entity35 boss has aimed a first swipe at his old mentor , suggesting @entity5 overpaid for teen sensation @entity38			0
@entity13 remained ice cool : ' no. i ’m not reacting to that kind of stuff			0
' he 'd be the first			0
here , @entity44 looks at @entity3 's war of words with top bosses throughout his time in @entity27			1
@entity49 @entity3 ’s trading of verbal blows with the @entity53 boss dates back to august 2005 , when @entity49 claimed that @entity7 ’s defensive tactics were putting ' the sport in danger '			1
the @entity12 responded by calling @entity49 a ' voyeur ' and , since then , a never - ending battle has taken place between the pair			0
last season proved no exception , with the @entity63 being labelled a ' specialist in failure ' by the @entity66 before @entity49 had another blast at the @entity7 manager over the transfer of @entity70 to @entity5			1
a feud set to rumble on			0
@entity3 on @entity49 : ' he is what you call in @entity27 a voyeur			1
he is someone who likes to watch other people			0
there are some guys who , when they are at home , have this big telescope to look into the homes of other people and see what is happening			0
wenger must be one of them … it ’s a sickness			0
' wenger on @entity3 : ' he ’s out of order , disconnected with reality and disrespectful			1
when you give success to stupid people , it makes them more stupid sometimes			0
false handshake : @entity3 and @entity49 greet each other ahead of @entity53 's clash at @entity7 @entity97 the relationship between @entity3 and @entity97 has fluctuated over the years , with the two ‘ good friends ’ at one point and blasting each other at others			1
once @entity7 won the @entity106 title in 2005 and again a year later , the war of words began , with @entity97 questioning whether the @entity35 really were one of the best sides in world football			1
@entity3 responded by mocking the @entity111 ’s relative lack of success , asking the press ' how many championships has @entity97 won , ' before answering with ' none '			2
the row remains ongoing , with @entity97 recently claiming to want no association with the @entity7 manager , because of his ' crossing [ of ] the line of sportsmanship			2
' @entity3 on @entity97 ( upon leaving @entity123 in 2010 with the @entity111 replacing him ) : ' one thing is for certain , @entity97 wo n’t do better than me			2
' @entity97 on @entity3 : ' i like to talk about facts			2
at @entity127 , we eliminated his @entity7 from the @entity128 with a team that cost half as much as his side			2
with the most expensive squad at @entity132 , he did nothing in the @entity128			0
' feud rating : 7/10 - bubbling away			0
no eye contact : then @entity127 manager @entity97 fails to look at @entity7 boss @entity3 sir @entity136 @entity3 ’s relationship with the retired @entity5 manager has perhaps never been the one football fans would have expected			1
the pair have remained good friends , often sharing their footballing secrets with each other , as well as discussing players and tactics			1
the @entity12 tactician has said , very simply that the two men ' trust each other ' and that he knew of sir @entity136 ’s retirement long before the news was broken			1
in return , @entity3 informed @entity136 of his return to @entity7			1
the pair have traded harsher blows at times , with the @entity158 complaining about @entity3 ’s ' personal crusade ' against him			2
@entity3 also had to patch up their relationship after berating @entity136 for pressurising the referee at half - time during a @entity165 semi-final			1
@entity3 is said to have cried when not approached to succeed @entity136 , having been convinced , says journalist @entity166 , by a ' friendship of genuine trust '			1
@entity3 on @entity136 : ' he was unique , absolutely unique			1
the number of trophies he won for @entity5 in @entity27 football is absolutely amazing			0
' @entity136 on @entity3 : ' @entity3 understands winning and losing are twins in a way			1
when you win you do n’t gloat and when you lose you do n’t go bananas			0
' feud rating : 3/10 - friendly with the occasionally harsh mind - games			2
good friends : former @entity5 boss sir @entity136 has made it clear he is a keen admirer of @entity3 @entity182 there is little love lost between @entity3 and the current @entity186 manager			1
the rivalry dates back to the pair ’s time in @entity190 , with @entity3 , succeeding the @entity191 as manager of @entity132 , claiming @entity182 ’s second place finish the previous season made real ' the first loser '			2
bitterness has lingered ever since and has now been transferred to the @entity106			0
@entity3 leaping into the @entity198 crowd after a late winner against @entity186 last year , followed by a refusal to shake hands , did not help matters , but @entity182 ultimately had the final word by capturing the @entity106 crown			2
@entity3 on @entity182 : ' second place is just the first loser			2
if @entity132 were to fire me , i would n’t go to @entity208			0
i ’d go to a top - level team in @entity210 or the @entity106			0
' @entity182 on @entity3 : ' i did n’t expect anything else [ from him ]			2
i do n’t like coaches who are only interested in results			0
the concepts of spectacle and creativity are fundamental to me			0
' feud rating : 6/10 - a rivalry which keeps threatening to ignite			0
@entity3 keeps fuelling the fire , @entity182 tries to keep out of it			2
big rivals : @entity3 's @entity7 will compete with @entity186 for the title next season @entity224 @entity3 created hostility between himself and the @entity226 upon his succession at @entity123			1
the @entity12 later claimed @entity224 left him with little more than a ' five - a - side team ' and the now @entity230 manager responded by saying the comments were born out of jealousy			0
@entity3 is said to have turned down the invitation of @entity224 to join him for dinner after @entity7 ’s @entity128 tie with @entity230 last season , keeping tensions high between the two men			1
@entity3 on @entity224 : ' i wo n’t have a meal with somebody [ @entity224 ] who has the same job as i do and the only thing we have in common is the fact we ’re both football managers			1
' @entity224 on @entity3 : ' when i went to @entity123 they played very bad football and we changed this			2
he took a team that i had built			0
' feud rating : 7/10 - not the greatest of friends			0
true enemies : @entity3 and @entity224 have both made it clear they do not see eye - to - eye @entity261 the young @entity12 manager worked closely under @entity3 at @entity7 and @entity123 , before a spectacular fall - out between the two after @entity261 left to become a coach himself , having apparently not informed @entity3 of his unhappiness in a lesser role			1
the former has since claimed he does not even have @entity3 ’s phone number and their relationship has remained frosty ever since			2
the rivalry eased somewhat after @entity261 was sacked by @entity270 late last year , with @entity3 calling his former protégé to console him and remind him that “ another job will come			2
” @entity3 on @entity261 : ' i do n’t care what he says			2
i ’m not here to do that			0
' @entity261 on @entity3 : ' we had a great personal and professional relationship before			0
we do n’t have that now			0
' feud rating : 5/10 - a bad fall out but the ice is thawing slowly			0
compatriots : @entity261 learned his trade under @entity7 boss @entity3 @entity286 the @entity288 manager is another with whom @entity3 enjoys a largely friendly relationship			1
@entity3 voiced his support for @entity286 after the latter was banned for headbutting @entity293 ’s @entity292 in march this year , saying he ' spoke with @entity286 ' just a couple of hours after the incident took place			1
@entity286 , in return , praised @entity3 ’s tactics and influence			1
whilst @entity3 was with @entity132 , @entity286 was full of praise for him , calling him a ' big manager ' and suggesting that his ' impact can not be lost on my education '			1
@entity3 on @entity286 : ' he is a good friend and a great guy			1
' @entity286 on @entity3 : ' there were things i was seeing [ from @entity3 ] that i had n’t seen in @entity27 football before			1
some of the managerial traits he was bringing i ’ve learned from			0
and i ca n’t help but say i ’ve nicked a few of them ! ' feud rating : 1/10 - a genuine friendship			0
friends reunited : @entity3 and @entity288 boss @entity286 have a strong relationship @entity316 @entity3 and @entity316 have relatively little history between them , which is understandable considering @entity3 ’s view that he would never want to fight the @entity321 manager , who would in his words ' kill me '			1
the last @entity106 campaign did see a war of words however , with the pair trading blows at their respective press conferences after a goalless draw at @entity198			0
@entity3 on @entity316 ’s tactics : ' it ’s very difficult to play a football match where only one team wants to play			1
this is football from the nineteenth century			0
' @entity316 on @entity3 : ' i do n’t give a s * * * e to be honest … we ’ve out - tacticed him , outwitted him			0
' feud rating : 4/10 - a spat which could continue into next season			0
scary opposition : @entity3 has said that he would not want to get in a spat with @entity316 video next season will be tough - @entity3			0

@entity3 has been involved in public spats with several managers
@entity3 has already tried to play mind games with @entity1
the @entity7 boss is good friends with sir @entity136 and @entity286
