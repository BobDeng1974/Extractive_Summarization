@entity0 was warned that her financial sector reforms would lead to a new culture of ‘ unscrupulous ’ practices in the @entity4 , according to newly - released government papers			1
her most senior official , cabinet secretary sir @entity6 , set out his ‘ increasing disquiet ’ about ‘ the things that people think are going on in the @entity4 ’			1
he said that a ‘ bubble ’ was being created that would be ‘ pricked ’ and said that ‘ corners were being cut ’ and money made in ways ‘ that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous ’			1
critics claim that mrs @entity0 ’s reform of the financial sector paved the way for the ‘ loadsamoney ’ era and the future financial crisis of 2007 which led to economic downturn			1
the memo came just months before the @entity31 - the deregulation of the @entity33 and its replacement with electronic trading floors and foreign investors			0
it was so called because the change meant a huge increase in activity and established @entity41 as the premier international financial centre and brought huge wealth to @entity45 workers			0
but it was also a period also of financial scandals - most notably the @entity49 share - rigging affair which involved an attempt to manipulate the stock market			0
in an extraordinary memorandum contained in files released by the @entity54 in @entity55 , west @entity41 , sir @entity6 put down on paper his doubts about the effect the changes were having			1
cabinet secretary sir @entity6 set out his ‘ increasing disquiet ’ about ‘ the things that people think are going on in the @entity4 ’ in a memo to the prime minister in march 1986 jan 1984 : ftse 100 index of 100 leading shares created , at a base of 1,000 points oct 1986 : the @entity31 reforms deregulated the stock market , with new technology sweeping aside old trading practices			1
banks were able to buy up old stockbroking firms , seeing high street names becoming players on the stock market 19 oct 1987 : @entity78 sees stock values crash around the world , down almost 11 per cent			0
the following day the @entity81 fell by 12.22 per cent 30 dec 1999 : @entity81 peaks at 6950.6 , a level not since surpassed 11 sep 2001 : @entity85 terror attacks cause panic around the world and the @entity81 falls by almost 6 per cent 4 sep 2007 : the amount banks lend to each other hits highest level since 1998 14 sep 2007 : @entity92 goes to the @entity93 for a bailout after suffering a run on its money 15 sep 2008 : @entity97 collapses 29 sep 2008 : @entity81 falls 5.3 per cent after @entity98 and @entity99 is nationalised 21 jan 2008 : @entity81 slumps 5.5 per cent , wiping £ 77billion off the value of shares 13 oct 2008 : @entity103 government orders £ 37billion bailout of @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 his note , dated march 17 1986 , seven months before the @entity31 , was addressed to mrs @entity0 ’s private secretary @entity110 , who would almost certainly have shown it to her			2
while he acknowledged his concerns were ‘ pretty vague and unspecific ’ , he said that he was by no means alone in harbouring such doubts			0
‘ i do not know whether you are having the same experience but i am finding , among people who work outside the @entity45 but whose activities bring them into touch in some degree with the @entity4 , that there is increasing disquiet about the things that people think are going on in the @entity4 , ’ he wrote			1
‘ i do not just mean the levels of remuneration ; a lot of people , including some from inside the @entity45 , think that is a bubble that will be pricked in a year or two			0
‘ they think more about the way in which corners are being cut and money is being made in ways that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous			1
‘ it tends to be summed up by the people saying that they doubt whether it really is good enough any more to leaving the policing of the @entity4 to self - regulation			2
‘ i ’m afraid that all this is pretty vague and unspecific ; but i find it sufficiently prevalent to be concerned			0
’ mrs @entity0 received an altogether rosier assessment from @entity144 , who was then working in the no 10 policy unit and who co-authored a paper for her on the likely impact of @entity31			0
the paper dismissed concerns that it could lead to a repeat of the ‘ boom and bust ’ which followed previous @entity4 deregulation in 1971 when a property boom was followed by a market collapse and a banking crisis			2
‘ this does not mean that there might not be individual financial failures as a result of bad commercial decisions , but we do not expect a systemic problem , ’ the paper noted .			2
