the thieves struck in broad daylight , seemingly undaunted by the fact that they were surrounded by dozens of members of the public			2
yesterday , the @entity5 announced that between 8am and 3pm last thursday — peak visiting hours — a rare species of water lily , the nymphaea thermarum , had been stolen from the @entity10 at @entity12 ’s @entity11			1
they believe the specimen of the smallest water lily in the world , with flowers smaller than a pound coin , was wrenched or dug up from its shallow pond before being smuggled out			1
the smallest waterlily in the world was stolen from @entity11 this week during peak visiting hours , @entity5 have announced the plant — discovered in south - west @entity25 not quite three decades ago by @entity27 botanist professor @entity26 — is now extinct in the wild			1
there are only a few cultivated samples at @entity11 and in @entity27			1
@entity32 ’s specimen has been described as of ‘ enormous scientific importance ’			2
‘ it ’s difficult to put a value on it , ’ says @entity34 , @entity11 ’s director of horticulture			1
‘ they ’re incredibly hard to cultivate and we have only a small number			2
it has been known in just one location in the wild			2
’ but if he is devastated , he is n’t surprised			2
‘ there are people who act this way			0
the trade in stolen plants is a global issue			1
’ of course , plant cuttings have been taken surreptitiously by keen gardeners for centuries			0
records from the @entity53 in the 18th century refer to thieves ‘ plucking up , digging up , breaking , spoiling and carrying away ’ flowers , shrubs and trees			1
indeed , @entity11 is no stranger to such crime ; the @entity60 was introduced in 1847			1
at first a small band of former soldiers who doubled as gardeners , these days there are eight constables dealing with everything from lost property to plant rustling			0
officials at @entity11 say there have been cases of women spiriting away plants in their handbags			1
but last week ’s incident was something different : there is every indication the water lily was the target of a pre-planned operation by an experienced professional			1
the rare , tiny flower that was originally found in @entity25 is now extinct in the wild ‘ to reach where it was growing required several steps across a wet garden — it ’s not just someone taking advantage or being opportunistic , ’ says @entity34			0
‘ they had their eye on that particular species			0
’ the corner of the conservatory from which it was stolen is one of a few areas not monitored by cctv cameras — suggesting the thief may have scouted out the crime scene			1
it may sound far - fetched , but organised plant theft is an increasingly common occurrence			1
in 2012 , a clump of rare arum maculatum — known as lords - and - ladies or cuckoo - pint — was stolen from a beauty spot in @entity109 , @entity110			1
the stubby green plant with a flower resembling a lily is believed to have been taken by those seeking to profit from its rumoured medicinal benefits			0
some practitioners of alternative medicine mistakenly believe it can cure cancer			0
in 2011 , a rare 100 - year - old filmy fern vanished from the @entity126 - run @entity124 estate near @entity127 , @entity128			0
the estate is a designated site of @entity130 — damaging such an area is an offence under the @entity133 , punishable by a fine of up to £ 20,000			0
@entity135 inspects the flower and , in 2010 , a lady ’s slipper orchid growing on the @entity140 golf course in @entity141 was given police protection , including patrols and @entity144			0
the measures were taken to avoid a repeat of the 2004 incident that saw a lady ’s slipper dug up and stolen from the course overnight			1
private collectors are prepared to pay up to £ 5,000 for a specimen			0
a new breed of plant thieves are targeting ordinary back gardens , too			0
according to one recent survey , more than a fifth of households have had a plant stolen from their garden			1
exotic species , such as lilies , olive trees , bonsais and magnolia trees , are the most popular targets			0
so , just who are the criminals and how do they operate ? one theory is that the crime is perpetrated by professional thieves stealing to order for wealthy private collectors			1
@entity174 , of @entity175 , a non-governmental organisation that monitors the black market in plants and wildlife , says : ‘ we know there are very rich people who will pay up to £ 10,000 to get their hands on a rare orchid , cactus or lily			1
’ there is a thriving international black market for rare species , stretching across @entity190 to the @entity191 , where many rare plants are valued for medicinal benefits			2
of the 799 illegal plant seizures reported by @entity196 border police in 2012 , 42 per cent were packaged as alternative remedies			0
given the sums for which they can swap hands , it ’s not surprising that criminal gangs , more accustomed to dealing in drugs or the proceeds of robberies , are turning their attention to plant rustling			0
would - be thieves even advertise on the internet , offering to steal the rarest plants			2
police officers in @entity213 have expressed alarm at ‘ work parties ’ of illegal immigrants being used to steal sphagnum moss ( used to line hanging baskets ) , primroses and snowdrops to sell to nurseries across @entity222 , with the proceeds being used to fund other criminal activity			0
the law on such matters is clear			0
it is an offence to uproot a wild plant without the permission of the landowner			0
in the case of rare species , it is also an offence to pick the plants or sell them			2
where plants have been cultivated by a botanical garden , they are private property			2
staff at @entity11 said the incident was not isolated , and that there have been other instances of theft in the past the @entity5 has a dedicated @entity246 and 178 countries have signed the @entity249 agreement pledging not to trade in stolen plants , but enforcing these laws is extremely difficult			1
conviction rates for plant - related crime are extremely low			0
such is the difficulty in tracing stolen plants that @entity256 recently took to attaching microchips to council - owned flowers			1
back at @entity11 , they are stepping up security following the theft of the water lily and appealing to members of the public to be vigilant when visiting the gardens			1
of course , the only way to ensure the safety of plants of such scientific importance would be to remove them from public view — something that @entity32 says it will have to consider if stocks dwindle			2
that would be a terrible shame			0
as @entity34 puts it : ‘ putting plants under lock and key would take the joy out of visits here			2
and it would let the thieves win			0

the world *'s* smallest waterlily was stolen from @entity11 last week
officials say theft has occurred with women stealing flowers in handbags
experts describe the trade in stolen plants as a ' global issue '
