a @entity1 photographer has created the world 's first printer which produces self - destructing documents , just like those seen in @entity6 : impossible			1
similar in size to a regular printer but much more complex , the device coats paper in particular substances that begin to ignite when combined			1
this gives the reader just 60 seconds to read the paper document before it bursts into flames			1
the device was created by @entity1 photographer @entity19			1
it is part of a project called ' this tape @entity22 '			1
its name is in homage to the 1966 spy series @entity27 , which also spawned several movies @entity19 , 27 , spent a year building the printer			2
the complex machine coats one part of the paper with a light dusting of potassium salts while layering another section with glycerol gel			1
once the print is finished , a mechanism in the printer presses the two sections together , sparking a chemical reaction which destroys the document in a mission : impossible - style blaze after a delay of around a minute			2
mr @entity19 titled his quirky homebrew project this tape @entity22 in homage to the 1966 spy series			1
earlier this month @entity51 - based electronics company @entity50 unveiled two new printers that have refillable tanks rather than ink cartridges			2
in place of costly cartridges they both have an ink reservoir			0
this can print 4,000 pages in black or 6,500 in colour on one fill			0
when depleted it costs £ 8 to refill the printers with @entity50 's own ink			0
two printers are on sale now , the @entity69 at £ 249.99 ( $ 400 ) and the @entity70 at £ 329.99 ( $ 530 )			0
both come with wireless connectivity so users can print from their smartphones			0
mr @entity19 said : ' it 's a pretty slow reaction so it gives you about a minute to read the document			1
it will then start to smoke and eventually go up in flames			0
' the printer cost more than £ 4,000 ( $ 6,440 ) to build			2
mr @entity19 used a laser cutter to fashion many of the machine 's individual components			2
mr @entity19 said : ' it took a very long time to build			2
i had no social life for the best part of a year			0
' despite the machine 's potential for making sure sensitive documents do not fall into the wrong hands , mr @entity19 is pessimistic about its chances of adoption among the security services			2
he said : ' i do n't think the security agencies will be using this technology any time soon			0
' they 're more interested in encryption for digital files			0
' there is n't much need for the destruction of hard - copy documents any more			0
' the £ 4,000 printer coats paper in potassium salts and glycerol gel			1
when combined they start to ignite in 60 seconds			1
this gives the reader just a minute before the paper catches fire			1
mr @entity19 got the idea from the @entity115 and @entity116 scandals			1
but he says it might not have much use in the digital age ' what was happening in the news really reminded me of 1960s spy novels , ' said mr @entity19			1
' it was this blurring of fiction and reality that made me want to take something from a spy thriller and make a real , functioning object			0
' pictured is a scene from the 1996 movie mission : impossible starring @entity133 mr @entity19 became fascinated with replicating the iconic tv gadget after reading several articles on the @entity115 and @entity116 scandals			1
mr @entity19 said : ' i had read an article on how the @entity139 had gone back to using typewriters to avoid the leaking of digital files			1
' what was happening in the news really reminded me of 1960s spy novels			0
' it was this blurring of fiction and reality that made me want to take something from a spy thriller and make a real , functioning object			0
' in september 2014 mr @entity19 , who was born in @entity150 , debuted the machine in @entity150 's @entity152 in @entity153			2
while on display guests could print out combustible documents that were stored on an internal , encrypted , sd card within the printer			0
video footage and burnt images from this tape will self destruct will stay on display at the @entity152 until february 2015			0
the machine itself was put into storage having been deemed a major fire hazard if operated without supervision .			0
