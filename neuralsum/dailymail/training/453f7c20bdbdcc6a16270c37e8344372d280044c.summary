by @entity0 for @entity1 princes @entity2 and @entity3 are both fierce competitors on the polo field , but even when they win @entity6 heads straight home to his family , while @entity3 's up for a celebratory drink			1
that 's according to @entity12 , one of three @entity14 cousins on the international polo circuit , who now counts the princes as mates after saddling up with the royal pair and helping them to victory at a competition at @entity23 this year			1
‘ @entity3 makes fun of @entity25 by telling him that he 's whipped ! ' @entity12 told @entity1			1
‘ @entity25 had to go home to @entity27 and @entity28 , but @entity3 was very keen to hang around for drinks at the function afterwards			1
