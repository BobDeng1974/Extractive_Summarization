a footballer woke from a coma after a horrific car crash thinking he was @entity4 actor @entity3 and speaking fluent @entity5 – despite only having a basic grasp from school			1
@entity8 , 25 , suffered a serious brain injury and a broken pelvis after his van flipped over on the @entity12 near @entity13 , @entity14 , and five vehicles ploughed into it in august 2012			1
he was placed in an induced coma for six days and when he finally came round he started chatting to nurses in fluent @entity5 even though he had not spoken the language in 12 years			1
the former semi-professional footballer for @entity21 also said he did not recognise himself in the mirror as he was convinced he was @entity23 - winning actor @entity3			1
' when i went to the toilet i went to look in the mirror and i was shocked because i did n't look like him , i did n't know what i was looking at			0
' then slowly over time it eventually clicked and i thought ' he is an actor , what am i on about ? ' but at times i was in hospital thinking i ca n't wait to get out of here and back to filming movies			2
' i was convinced i was him and that i had his good looks as well - i know it was hopeful thinking really			2
' doctors at @entity49 's @entity48 found he had suffered a multifocal intracranial brain haemorrhage , which meant his blood vessels had burst and blood was leaking into his brain			2
the former semi-professional footballer said he did not recognise himself in the mirror as he was convinced he was @entity23 - winning actor @entity3 he suffered a suffered a serious brain injury , a broken pelvis and hurt his arm after his van flipped over and five vehicles ploughed into it he left the hospital in november 2012 no longer believing he was @entity3 , but still able to speak in fluent @entity5 – a skill he still retains two years on			1
' i did n't even do @entity5 at @entity66 so have n't studied it since year 9 - then all of a sudden i 'm fluent in it , ' he said			1
' i ca n't explain how it happened			0
i do n't remember coming round but my family said one of the nurses was from @entity74 and spoke @entity5 and i was having conversations with her			2
' i was just casually chatting away about how i was feeling in this perfect @entity5 accent			1
' my mum and dad were stunned when they got to hospital and the nurse asked them what side of the family was @entity5			2
he was treated with an experimental drug and learned walk again in just two months ' and then i was sitting there spouting a foreign language from my hospital bed acting all @entity5 in their sort of arrogant yet sophisticated way			1
it was n't me at all			0
' i was n't really that good at it at school , so i do n't how my brain has managed to do what is has			2
i do n't know how i know it - i just do			2
' the talented footballer also went through several stages of believing he was 12 or 14 - years - old and would cry when his parents left the hospital			1
' i 'd ask @entity103 if she 'd fed our dog but he 'd died three or four years before			2
as soon as she said that i cried , too			0
then my memory clicked in and i thought , ' oh yeah , what was that all about ? ' ' i remember @entity103 helping me to the toilet and i could n't believe who i was looking at when i saw myself in a mirror			0
i had a scar on my right temple and that side of my hair had been shaved off			0
' i did n't realise until then that i 'd had a brain injury			1
i just thought i was there for a broken hip and elbow			0
' he had to undergo many psychological tests because his brain injury was so complex			1
' they 'd ask me to do simple things like draw a line from a to b and i 'd be thinking , ' are you serious ? ' then i 'd find it really difficult , ' he explains			0
' it was like my brain was playing catch - up with my hand			2
' he was treated with an experimental drug after his family were approached by the @entity134 and @entity135			1
mr @entity8 from @entity136 , @entity137 , was the second person in @entity138 to have the treatment - which drew upon the @entity141 's expertise with injured soldiers			1
his family was warned that everyday activities such as getting dressed would be difficult and that he would struggle with short - term memory			2
but he learned to walk again in just two months and even got back in the football squad			0
he now works as a barber and is convinced his recovery is down to the experimental drug			1
' i feel it made a difference to me and because i do n't remember the crash , it does n't feel like i 've had a brain injury			1
apart from obviously being able to now speak @entity5			1
' the accident changed my outlook on life			0
i ca n't leave the house now without telling everyone i love them and giving them a hug			0
he had to undergo many psychological tests because his brain injury from the car crash was so complex his parents @entity167 , 57 , and @entity168 , 62 , could not believe when he started speaking fluent @entity5 in hospital ' i know with a click of your fingers , it could all be over , because life is fragile			1
there 's no point in wasting any time			0
' his mother @entity167 , 57 , said : ' he is so lucky to be alive			0
we thought we would lose him			0
then all of a sudden he wakes up and he 's speaking @entity5			1
' this nurse was from @entity74 and spoke @entity5 - she asked us what side of the family was from @entity185 , as his accent was so good			2
' well i told her none of us			0
the brain really is an incredible thing , nobody has quite been able to explain why it has happened			0
' @entity193 , a spokesperson for brain injury association @entity194 , said : ' waking from a coma is not how it 's often portrayed in the movies			1
' it can be a very gradual process , with the patient suffering bouts of confusion and disorientation as the brain tries to recover some functionality			0
' after a coma , during a period known as post-traumatic amnesia ( @entity211 ) , the patient 's behaviour may well be restless , disinhibited and agitated for example , with uncharacteristic behaviour not uncommon			0
' while different parts of our brain are responsible for different things , all parts of the brain are interconnected			0
damage to one part of the brain can lead to increased activity in other parts of the brain , which can sometimes result in surprising and unexpected effects			0
' the reality for most , however , is that the recovery journey from a brain injury can arduous and last a lifetime with patients often faced with having to relearn the most basic of life skills			1
' he had trials with @entity237 at the age of 14 and played for @entity21 until the accident			0
