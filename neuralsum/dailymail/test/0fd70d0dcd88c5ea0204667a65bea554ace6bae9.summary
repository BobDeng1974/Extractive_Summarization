it really is tough to think of a previous @entity2 game of such importance being undercut by this depth of friendship between dugouts			2
@entity7 and @entity8 know each other inside out			1
they also know how their careers could be shaped by 90 minutes of football at @entity12			0
from living 10 minutes apart in @entity14 and @entity15 , the pair will be 10 metres away from each other on a touchline in @entity18 , relishing the pressure			0
the careers of @entity7 ( above ) and @entity8 ( below ) could be shaped by 90 minutes on tuesday @entity8 's @entity21 go to the home of @entity24 's @entity23 for a match that could see them out of the bottom three a match of this magnitude is what these two @entity30 coaches craved during years working together at @entity32 , probably believing they would be united in battle			1
a quirky sequence of events has pitted them on opposite sides instead			0
@entity7 came close to the @entity21 job when @entity39 resigned , but @entity40 was sacked in the same period and @entity23 placed the call			1
@entity8 looked the unlikely choice at @entity43 but guided @entity21 to their first away @entity2 victory this season at @entity46 , earning the reins until the summer			1
a second win on the road at @entity50 on saturday means @entity21 can go above @entity23 with three points on tuesday night , plunging @entity7 ’s team into the relegation zone			1
the reverse result would take @entity23 to the precipice of safety , leaving @entity21 with a fainter glimmer of hope			1
@entity21 come into the match with confidence after a convincing 4 - 1 victory over @entity23 's neighbours @entity50 @entity62 celebrates his goal in @entity23 's 3 - 1 defeat by @entity65 on saturday it is a sliding doors match , the kind to be looked back upon in months to come as the moment futures were directed , both for clubs and managers			1
lose and suffer relegation ? @entity7 ’s position would come under considerable question , his trajectory as the bright thing of @entity30 coaching skewered			1
@entity8 would likely be shuffled back to a role behind the curtain			2
win and survive ? reputation enhanced , the opportunity to lay foundations would be presented			2
either way , this pair will share pints again , unpicking the evening when their top - flight statuses came under enormous scrutiny			0
neither @entity7 nor @entity8 has been trying to underplay this match , even if one offered a little more bombast than the other			1
‘ i think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club , ’ said @entity7			2
‘ if i could hype up the pressure even more i would			0
’ ‘ a win would be a fantastic boost for us because it would see us above the line , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ it would give the fans a lot of hope that we have a chance of staying up			0
’ neighbours within 10 minutes and friends , @entity8 ( centre ) and @entity24 ( right ) know each other inside out the pair worked together at @entity32 with @entity110 ( second right ) , now @entity21 's director of football under the floodlights , this promises to be a thrilling night of action			1
@entity12 has already enjoyed that with back - to - back matches in darkness against @entity50			0
the second victory , in the @entity117 , sparked a pitch invasion			0
the atmosphere against @entity21 will be tense and frenetic again			2
@entity7 will live every moment on the sidelines , @entity8 will be more considered			1
there are likely to be some telling looks either direction			0
both would be inclined to work with each other again			0
‘ he ’s a good pal of mine and a very loyal friend , but it ’s been put to one side , ’ insisted @entity7			1
‘ considering we worked together for four - five years before , there is going to be some sort of strange feeling , ’ said @entity8			1
once the whistle blows it is down to the players , of course			0
@entity21 ’s will bounce into action off the back of one of their finest performances this season			2
@entity23 underwhelmed in defeat at @entity146			2
the @entity148 hotel just off @entity149 brought comfort for @entity8 ’s squad during their trip to the @entity153 three days ago , but @entity154 , scorer of two in two , will be missing through injury this time			1
@entity157 , who claimed a wonderful strike at the @entity159 , has been wrapped in cotton wool over the weekend			1
@entity21 will be without @entity154 , who scored his second in two games against @entity50 @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 are out for @entity23 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity169 major doubts			1
@entity7 wants attacking football with a gritty underbelly , @entity8 is likely to map out a plan to threaten on the break			1
@entity174 have been beaten late at home under @entity7 , as @entity8 will be aware			1
quality may suffer in the circumstances , but excitement should still course through the encounter			0
@entity62 struggled on return form @entity182 injury and looked disinterested at times under @entity40 , seems to have found his mojo for @entity24 as four goals in four games testifies			0
should strike terror into @entity21 at his best			2
@entity190 the beating heart of @entity23 , a demanding , driving bundle of energy in midfield to whom others turn			2
scored the breakthrough goal in the @entity117 tie against @entity50 and needs a similar impact here			0
@entity190 is the beating heart of @entity23 @entity202 the 25 - year - old has grown in stature this season for @entity23 , a vocal presence at the back and thoroughly committed			2
he will be the defender to put in a tackle of substance to get the fans cheering			0
@entity211 has now scored 16 @entity2 goals this season , a remarkable tally in his debut campaign			0
will look to get on the end of any opportunities in the area and has movement to trouble			0
@entity221 was at his snarling best against @entity50 , tackling and passing to dominate midfield			0
picked up his eighth booking in ten games but is available against @entity23			2
much depends on how much he imposes himself			0
@entity221 's midfield menace is key for @entity21 @entity157 produced probably the best goal of his career aged 34 at the @entity159 and has rested up since			1
his aching limbs mean training is minimal			0
but on the pitch he can provide a focal point to attacks and win plenty in the air .			0
