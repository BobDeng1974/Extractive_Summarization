a retired policeman battled for three hours to catch a halibut weighing a whopping 38.5 stone to claim a world record			1
the super flat fish was so big that at one point @entity6 's rod snapped in two as he was tried to snare the creature off the island of @entity10 in northern @entity11			1
the 62 - year - old and two others were only able to haul it onto their boat after tying a rope around it when it came alongside			0
what a catch ! : @entity6 caught this halibut in the north of @entity11 , it took him three hours to pull the fish in the 8ft 3in @entity24 halibut tipped the scales at just over 540lb - smashing the previous world record by an impressive 58lb			1
it would have sold for about £ 2,500 at a @entity30 fish market and made about 1,000 fillet portions			1
a good quality fish restaurant can charge £ 25 for a halibut main course , meaning the record fish could have realised a value of £ 25,000			1
despite being very tired after catching the halibut , mr @entity6 still went through with a bet to shave off his beard the men had previously made for netting the biggest fish			1
three hour battle : @entity6 , 62 , fought with the monster from the deep for three hours before he and three fishermen colleagues finally detained it boat skipper @entity46 , 53 , said : ' it was an incredible experience and we are very proud			0
' @entity6 was very tired afterwards but also intoxicated by the experience and by claiming a world record			1
' we had made a bet to shave his beard if he caught the biggest fish			2
like a good sport he went through with it			2
' @entity46 said : ' the halibut took @entity6 's little jigg bait and his rod bent over double			2
' we all watched for a few minutes and then it became clear this was going to be a big fish			2
' after about 90 minutes of @entity6 trying to reel it in his rod broke in two from the pressure it was under			0
it was his favourite rod			0
supersize : at 8ft 3ins the @entity24 halibut tipped the scales at just over 540 pounds - smashing the previous world record by an impressive 58lbs ' because i am taller than him i took what was left of his rod and after another hour the fish was alongside the boat			1
it was then seen for the first time and it was a huge fish			2
' it then shot another 100 metres deep and it took me another 15 minutes to bring him up and another 15 minutes to get a rope around it			0
' it was a team effort but @entity6 was the official catcher			0
' the men each took about 25lb of halibut fillets home and the rest was given away to other anglers and locals			0
the previous record for an @entity24 halibut was held by fellow @entity90 @entity89 who caught a 483lb specimen off @entity92 last year			1
anglers @entity93 and @entity95 caught a 464lbs halibut off @entity11 in 2009			0
before that @entity99 angler @entity97 caught a then - record 443lbs specimen in the @entity101 off @entity11 in 2008			0
the biggest @entity102 caught was by @entity103 off @entity104 in november 1996 with a 459lbs fish			0
@entity24 halibut - @entity106 in @entity107 - is among the largest bony fish in the world			1
their native habitat is the northern @entity24 , from @entity112 to the @entity113 and as far south as the @entity114			1
they can reach up to 15ft in length , weigh up to 700lbs and can live for 50 years			0
their diet is usually other fish like cod , haddock and herring although they do face predation from seals and the @entity112 shark .			0

8ft 3in @entity24 halibut smashed previous world record by 58lb
would make 1,000 fillet portions and as a good quality fish restaurant can charge £ 25 for halibut main course , it could have realised a value of £ 25,000
