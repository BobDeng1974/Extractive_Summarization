so does one still rule the waves ? that may have been the question asked by the @entity3 yesterday - and the unimpressed look that followed may have revealed the answer she may well have been concerned to learn how much @entity8 's naval might has diminished since 1977			0
her majesty was being shown a chart outlining the current strength of the @entity12 at @entity14 's @entity13 as the @entity15 finally received his birthday present			1
@entity17 and the @entity15 ( right ) are shown a map by @entity19 , admiral sir @entity20 ( centre ) during a visit to @entity13 in central @entity23 the @entity15 was given the office of titular head of the @entity12 , for his 90th on june 10			1
for a man who has achieved much in his years the @entity3 may have been in a quandary as to what to get her husband			0
but as a former @entity12 officer it was fitting the title of @entity34 - which dates back to the 14th century - was chosen as a gift			1
@entity15 gave up his promising career on the seas to devote his life to @entity40 duty and support his wife in her role as @entity43			1
and yesterday at @entity13 , the former home of the @entity44 , the @entity15 received the @entity45 as the holder of the title , as the @entity3 watched			1
in the 18th century building 's @entity48 - where @entity50 attended meetings and the @entity52 still meets today - @entity15 saw the formal document			2
prince @entity15 takes the salute during his visit to the @entity56 and @entity13 , where he formally received @entity45 as the holder of the title and office of lord high admiral prince @entity15 and the @entity3 were treated to a display of precision drumming by five members of the @entity63 of drummers he listened intently as a senior naval officer gave a brief speech on the history of the title which had been held by the @entity3 since 1964 until this summer			1
when the description turned to the previous holder before the @entity3 , the @entity69 , later @entity70 , @entity15 laughed when told that the royal had argued with his advisory council ' and when in 1828 he led a squadron out for manoeuvres without consulting either his council , the @entity43 or the @entity78 and was gone , no one knew where , for 10 days it proved too much and he was asked to resign '			1
during the event , @entity15 was wearing a flesh - coloured plaster on both ears above the lobe , but a @entity87 spokeswoman said she did not believe it was anything serious			2
admiral sir @entity20 , the @entity19 and chief of naval staff , hosted the event , which featured senior naval officers as well as rank - and - file sailors			0
the @entity15 studying in the section room at the @entity94 @entity15 and the @entity3 watched a display of precision drumming by five members of the @entity98 in the courtyard outside the building and also attended a reception for senior naval officers and ordinary servicemen before having lunch with the @entity12 's top brass			1
the @entity15 is an admiral of the fleet and the military uniform he wore today is the same outfit he was dressed in on his wedding day in 1947			1
the birthday gift from the @entity3 could be seen as a touching acknowledgement of the sacrifices the @entity15 has made for his wife			2
had he not become the monarch 's husband , some believe he would have been @entity19 , the professional head of the @entity12			2
in an @entity119 interview to mark his 90th year , he was asked how he felt giving up his job as a @entity12 officer			2
' i do n't know how difficult it was , it was naturally disappointing , ' he replied			0
' i had just been promoted to commander and the fact was that the most interesting part of my naval career was just starting			0
' by - gone age : the might of the @entity12 was there for all to see at @entity132 and @entity133 in 1977 for the @entity3 's @entity134 as part of the 1977 celebrations , the @entity3 reviewed the @entity137 at @entity138 on board @entity139 @entity15 joined the @entity12 after leaving school and in may 1939 enrolled at the @entity141 , in @entity142 , where he was singled out as best cadet			1
he rose rapidly through the ranks , earning promotion after promotion , but his life was to take a very different course			0
during the @entity149 , @entity15 served with the @entity151 and @entity152 fleets , and reached the rank of commander before his flourishing naval career came to a premature end in 1951			0
the health of his father - in - law @entity158 was deteriorating and @entity3 - in - waiting princess @entity17 was required to take on more royal responsibilities			0
@entity15 stepped down from his active role in the forces to fulfil his duty as her consort			0
his wife acceded to the throne within the year when the @entity43 died in february 1952			0
the number of warships in the @entity12 has fallen dramatically in the past 30 years			0
