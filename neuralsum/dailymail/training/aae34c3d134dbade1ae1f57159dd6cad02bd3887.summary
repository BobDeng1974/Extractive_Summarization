by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 founder @entity2 , a community college dropout who has gone on to build a $ 100million fashion business , has lifted the lid on her unlikely journey from thief to chief , rags to riches and anti-capitalist to ceo			1
‘ # @entity24 , ’ ms @entity2 's first foray into writing , has garnered attention since its release this month for the intimate details of the entrepreneur 's turbulent past : from being a broke and shoplifting youngster to harnessing the power of the @entity21 to sell vintage clothing on @entity23			1
sitting in her 55,000 - square - foot loft office in downtown @entity28 , the @entity30 - clad ms @entity2 , 30 , oversees hundreds of employees at @entity3 headquarters , her @entity23 business now a flourishing online fashion brand			1
hitting it big : @entity2 , founder and ceo of @entity3 , built her online business from an @entity23 shop to a multi-million - dollar company ‘ but there 's also the serendipity of meeting the right person at the right time , and the serendipity of just having the idea at the right time that drives you to actually ask for something rather than have it fall on your lap. ’ because ms @entity2 started her @entity23 boutique turned mega brand the age of 22 , she was not as concerned with the possibility of failure as many entrepreneurs typically can be			1
flair for design : @entity3 is known for its trendy merchandise , which runs the gamut from haute hippie to @entity62 raver ‘ but there 's also the serendipity of meeting the right person at the right time , and the serendipity of just having the idea at the right time that drives you to actually ask for something rather than have it fall on your lap. ’ because ms @entity2 started her @entity23 boutique turned mega brand the age of 22 , she was not as concerned with the premise of failure as many entrepreneurs typically can be			1
on shelves : ms @entity2 's first book , # @entity24 , was released earlier this month @entity75 formally launched in 2008 after ms @entity2 ’s @entity23 business had become so large that a standalone site became a plausible idea			1
her account on the auction site was terminated soon after amid allegations of ‘ linking out ’ ( leaving @entity23 without its commission fee ) , and toying with bids			2
the site is named for a song by @entity85 , and is known for its trendy merchandise , which runs the gamut from haute hippie to @entity62 raver - all at an affordable price			2
but despite her entrepreneurial spirit , ms @entity2 says that she never even intended to become a ceo			1
‘ failure is , it 's like those are the people who are going out in the world and saying , “ this is what i want to do , and if this does n't work , i 've failed , ” which i never did			0
i never wanted to be a ceo , ' she explained			0
‘ i mean , i want to be one today but i never intended to be a ceo			0
i never intended to build a $ 100 million business			0
if that was what i was focused on , i think i would be missing all of these things along the way , all of the small things that got us here			0
’ as for her lack of formal education , ms @entity2 , a @entity112 , @entity114 native , says ‘ [ college ] just was n't for me			2
i think it 's amazing			0
i think if you know what value you can derive from college and are mature enough to do that and get what there is to get out of the college experience , it 's perfect			0
‘ if you 're unhappy like i was , and too impatient to complete four years of anything at that age , it 's not for you			0

@entity2 is the 30 - year - old founder and ceo of @entity3
the site was founded in 2008 , following ms @entity2 's *immensely* *popular* @entity23 boutique for vintage clothes
