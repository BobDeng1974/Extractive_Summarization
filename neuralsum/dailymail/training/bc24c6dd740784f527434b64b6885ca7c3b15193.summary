for radicalised @entity1 women in @entity2 and beyond who seek to marry into the blood - stained ranks of @entity5 , @entity6 is the ultimate icon			1
she is the striking former wife of the supreme is leader and mother of his child ; a smuggler of gold chains worth hundreds of thousands of pounds – hidden under her burka – to finance the @entity17 ’s murderous schemes , and a figure so senior she was once central to a high - value prisoner exchange			1
and now , along with her daughter by @entity21 , she has special martyr status			1
her home is a cell in the grim @entity26 jail , one of the most feared prisons in the @entity29 , a military detention centre in @entity30 notorious for its dungeons and systematic use of torture			1
described by one @entity35 general as a ‘ fabulous beauty behind her veil ’ , the defiant prisoner in her early 30s is barred from receiving visitors			1
heavily armed female soldiers on the all - women wing pace the corridors outside as they keep watch over their prized captive			1
the only picture : @entity47 is the ultimate icon for radicalised @entity1 women in @entity2 and beyond @entity6 is probably the most infamous female jihadi operating in the maelstrom of the @entity29 – although only one picture believed to be of her exists			1
born in @entity51 into a family of lethal fanatics , her ex-husband is responsible for spreading bloody carnage across @entity51 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
@entity6 was caught late last year close to @entity35 ’s @entity58 coast with the couple ’s daughter after an @entity62 tip - off to @entity35 authorities			1
she was using false papers and smuggling huge sums of gold under her @entity68 dress to fund the murderous activities of militants			1
despite weeks of intensive questioning , however , she has said almost nothing and , astonishingly , her daughter @entity71 , thought to be only ten years old , has also refused to crack			1
to the dismay of local and @entity76 intelligence agencies , neither has given any significant information ; reports concluded both are ‘ well - trained ’ to withstand interrogations			2
yet , slowly , security teams are piecing together a hazy picture of a mysterious woman connected by family and three marriages to some of the world ’s most deadly firebrands			2
‘ one day they ’ll make a movie about her , ’ concluded an observer			2
certainly this independent and beguiling woman must have stood out in the sinister world of @entity68 fanatics as she flitted around @entity29 countries using false names – such a contrast with conventional jihadi imagery of docile women hidden away in homes			1
one analyst concluded her exploits on behalf of the extremists marked her out as an ‘ honorary jihadi man ’ ; another even called her ‘ a bit of a superstar ’			2
such is the secrecy swirling around @entity111 and his ex-wife , there are few precise details known about their relationship			2
@entity111 is thought to have had three wives , although @entity6 is the only one ever seen in public			2
yet she refused to confirm their marriage under interrogation in prison , sometimes responding in an aggressive or rude manner to questions			2
she even told one senior officer her husband was dead			2
@entity35 security sources say they wed six years ago in @entity55 , staying together for only three months			2
@entity47 is the former wife of is leader @entity21 and is the mother of his child their union would have come after @entity21 was freed by the @entity62 , who held him for three years in the aftermath of their ill - conceived invasion of @entity51 in 2003			1
having been radicalised in prison , @entity111 became head of the group now known as is within a year of his release			1
dna tests using samples taken during his detention confirm @entity71 is the daughter of the self - styled successor to the @entity143			1
yet one senior iraqi government source said there was evidence the couple married in 2005 – which would fit with the age of their child – and remained formally wed until two years ago			1
‘ everyone is very tight - lipped about her , ’ said @entity151 , author of @entity5 : the @entity153			2
‘ the problem is that these ultra-orthodox islamists do not like to talk about their wives , and when it comes to @entity111 there is little known about his wives or children			2
’ @entity6 had previously been married to another @entity51 militant leader named @entity162 , with whom she had her first child			1
he was gunned down by @entity51 troops five years ago			0
@entity51 sources believe @entity6 spent time in the @entity35 port of @entity168 last year before moving to @entity169 , a turbulent mountain town on the border , swollen by tens of thousands of refugees from the conflict in @entity55			0
during her months there , she frequently crossed the border wearing gold chains worth up to £ 25,000 hidden by wearing full hijab , knowing male border guards would not search her , then sold to provide funds for fighters			0
@entity35 security sources say she was so successful she is ‘ implicated ’ in providing several hundred thousand pounds to rebels from @entity183 – an @entity184 affiliate group – in the @entity55 border regions			0
she was caught in mid-november at a @entity35 army checkpoint in @entity187 near the fishing village of @entity189 , with papers claiming to be a @entity55 called @entity191 and two other sets of false documents			0
she was in the early stages of pregnancy after hooking up with her latest husband , a @entity56 or @entity197 militant from another extremist @entity199 group who has been arrested on charges of assisting @entity6 in funding terrorism			0
one intelligence source , asked what she had revealed , replied : ‘ only the devil knows			0
‘ my colleagues believe her cv , obtained by @entity35 security , is fraught with false confessions to avoid giving damaging leads			0
’ such is the confusion , @entity51 officials have even claimed she is not @entity21 ’s wife but the sister of a senior @entity184 commander awaiting execution in their country			1
@entity6 ’s importance to @entity17 first became apparent amid negotiations early last year to swap 150 women and children held by the @entity55 government for 13 @entity225 nuns , kidnapped by @entity227 rebels			1
during tense discussions , negotiators from @entity183 insisted a woman identified as @entity231 must be among those freed , even postponing the deal several times until this was agreed			0
‘ the negotiators said she was very important , ’ disclosed one security source			0
‘ they were ready to cancel the deal for her sake			0
’ the group was finally released in march , ‘ @entity231 ’ walking out with dainty handbag hanging from her arm and her two children alongside her			0
when a local official touched her , an @entity183 operative screamed : ‘ keep your hands away from that woman – no one touches her			0
’ days later , it emerged why she was seen as so special			1
first , a leading local jihadi cryptically tweeted : ‘ if only you knew , my brother , who was released in the negotiations , you would have cried a bit and laughed a lot			0
’ then , an @entity183 emir tweeted the truth : ‘ our sister , the wife of sheik @entity21 , @entity257 bless him , was freed by us			1
we did this because it ’s our duty			0
’ incredibly , the shaky @entity55 regime had released the former wife of @entity17 ’s leader – a person of immense symbolic and strategic significance to the barbaric group			1
now she is a possible pawn again in hostage negotiations , this time over the release of 25 @entity35 security personnel threatened with execution by @entity17 and @entity183 after being seized last august			0
a @entity35 @entity270 attempting to mediate their release claimed to have received a letter from @entity17 demanding @entity6 ’s release in return for those kidnapped			0
however , if she does end up dying for her twisted cause , @entity6 would be far from the first member of her extraordinarily - militant family to meet a bloody end			0
her father was a high - ranking jihadist who may have arranged her marriage to seal an alliance with @entity111 as the self - proclaimed caliph began his rise to power			0
he was reportedly killed in september while fighting against the @entity55			0
she has three brothers , all thought to be militants fighting in @entity55 and @entity51			0
one is said to have been caught and sentenced to death for a bombing in @entity290			0
her sisters include one reported to have died in a suicide attack , while a second was arrested with 13lb of explosives wrapped around her body in the @entity297 city of @entity298 , northern @entity51			0
this is indeed an extraordinary life story that seems like a film script			0
but sadly it would be for the darkest and most blood - drenched of stories , starring a deadly woman playing a key role in the horrific events ripping apart the @entity29 .			1

for radicalised @entity1 women , @entity47 is the ultimate icon
she *'s* the striking former wife of supreme is leader and mother of his child
she and her daughter by @entity21 have special martyr status
she is in the @entity26 jail , one of the most feared prisons in the @entity29
@entity30 military detention centre is notorious for its dungeons and systematic use of torture
