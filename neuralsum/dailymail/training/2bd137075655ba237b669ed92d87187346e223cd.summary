@entity7 , 55 , who wrote a training programme on avoiding avalanches , was one of three @entity3 swept more than 600ft to their deaths by a huge wall of snow			1
the victims were part of a group of 28 experienced climbers who had been attempting one of the most dangerous ascents in @entity19 to reach the summit of @entity21			1
tragedy : experienced climber @entity7 was killed by the avalanche in the @entity6			1
on the right , he is pictured during a climb in the @entity26 the climbers were hit by a 60ft high and 500ft wide wall of snow as they climbed 14,649ft @entity30 – which translates as ‘ cursed peak ’ – to reach @entity21			1
police in the nearby town of @entity34 confirmed that three @entity38 , two of them women , two @entity35 and one @entity37 victim were among the dead			1
nine others were airlifted to hospital with broken bones , dislocations and deep cuts			0
last night two other @entity3 climbers who had been missing feared dead walked into @entity34 police station			1
by nightfall all the climbers on the trip had been accounted for			2
dramatic pictures taken minutes after the disaster by mountaineer @entity52 show injured climbers huddled under survival blankets awaiting rescue			1
mr @entity57 , a guide who works for the @entity3 - run company @entity60 , was part of a following group and was one of the first on the scene			1
he said : ‘ i saw people coming down the mountain from the accident			0
some of them were bleeding and there were bad injuries – dislocated shoulders , broken legs			0
there were dead people as well , it was a horrible accident			2
we helped the injured climbers and mountain guides but the conditions were difficult			2
it was clear but there were very strong winds			0
@entity119 , 35 , was 100 yards away when the avalanche fell			0
the web designer from @entity122 said : ‘ we heard some crying and when we got up the slope we looked down and saw there had been an avalanche			0
‘ we could see maybe five or six bodies in the snow , and six or seven people with broken arms or legs			1
no one who was there had escaped injury , though some only had cuts on their faces and were walking around			0
’ @entity3 mountaineer @entity137 , based in @entity34 , said : ‘ it would have been a huge wave of snow			1
the climbers making their way up the slope would have had no chance			0
’ @entity6 rescuers believe the disaster unfolded after one of the lead climbers dislodged a bank of snow			2
unavoidable : mountain guide @entity57 's avalanche aftermath pictures show the devastating sheets of show after they shifted down the mountainside help : three members of the 28 - strong group wait for their rescue minutes after the @entity30 snow slide in the @entity6 @entity6 flying rescue : this was the view climbers had of helicopters flying towards the mountain to lift them to safety soon after the avalanche desperate search : emergency crews and climbers tried in vain to locate nine of their party , but were too late to save them disastrous : rescuers could do nothing to save nine climbers hit by the avalanche , as bodies were returned from the mountainside by helicopter tragic : the @entity6 @entity184 wheel away the body of the one of the avalanche victims as crews continued their desperate search for survivors saved : emergency crews arrive back in @entity34 with a survivor from the avalanche the six dead in the avalanche were said to have been in a group of 20 climbers when they were caught in the snow slide at the scene : the climbing route where emergency crews focused their searches is said to be one of the most dangerous in @entity19 the 28 climbers , who had split into two groups , had spent wednesday evening sleeping at @entity203 , a climbers ’ hut at 11,800ft			1
they left the hut at 1.30am and began their ascent in temperatures of minus @entity208 ( @entity209 )			0
when they left there were no weather reports warning of avalanche risks , officials say			0
however gusts of wind of up to 43mph may have created huge walls of snow , known as wind slabs , which are extremely dangerous when they collapse			0
the group were trying to climb up a steep snow - covered ridge on the north face of @entity30 at 13,120ft when the avalanche struck			1
one of the injured climbers called the emergency services on his mobile phone at 5.25am			0
another local guide said that some of the injured were dug out of the snow ‘ very quickly ’ by the first rescue teams on the scene			0
one of the first to arrive was a @entity3 guide @entity234 and his doctor client			2
they had left two hours later than the avalanched party after the guide expressed concerns about the weather			0
they gave first aid to the survivors and alerted the rescue services			0
climbers who were only 100 meters away from the avalanche , left , visiting survivors at @entity248 and sir @entity249 , right , the @entity3 ambassador to @entity250 arrived in @entity34 last night perilous : the @entity21 route , with @entity30 to the right , is one particularly popular with tourist climbers ( file picture ) rescue : a helicopter from the @entity258 ( emergency services ) flies over the @entity21 massif as investigators look for those stranded in the avalanche more than 50 mountain rescuers and police using teams of dogs and heat - seeking devices spent the day searching the snow in an attempt to find any bodies buried			1
teams of rescuers from across the border in @entity275 joined the search			0
the @entity21 massif , although hugely popular with tourists , is an extremely dangerous climbing area which takes over 100 lives every year			2
the route has some of the most easily accessible mountains in the world , but has hidden perils due to its changeable climate			0
unprecedented storms , as well as falling blocks and lightning strikes , all contribute to the dangers of the mountain range			0
in august 2008 eight climbers – three @entity37 , one @entity38 , and four @entity292 - died in a similar accident on the nearby @entity294			1
and a year earlier there was an even more catastrophic death toll , as nearly 30 were killed on @entity21 and its satellite peaks in july 2007			1
more recently , a @entity299 cross-country skier died in april after being caught up in an avalanche on @entity21 , only about a month after a @entity302 skier died after plunging into a 20 - metre ( 65 - foot ) crevice on the mountain			1
the latest tragedy on @entity30 - literally meaning ' @entity306 ' - is the biggest disaster to happen in the @entity6 in a decade			2
last night members of the close - knit climbing community were paying their respects to mr @entity7 , 55 , and the other climbers			1
@entity312 , chief executive of the @entity313 , said mr @entity7 was a former @entity313 general secretary and president of the @entity315			1
‘ @entity7 was one of the @entity3 ’s most enthusiastic and respected climbers with a track record of @entity319 and @entity26 mountaineering stretching back to the 1980s , ’ he said			1
‘ our thoughts are with @entity7 ’s friends and family , in particular his wife @entity326 ’ @entity324 , from the @entity325 , said : ‘ he was such an energetic character			2
he really was a truly remarkable and amazing individual			0
’ mr @entity7 , originally from @entity329 in @entity330 , was an expert guide with an intimate knowledge of the @entity319 range			2
the climber , who lived in @entity335 , @entity37 , with his wife , also a mountaineer , had been on 20 expeditions to some of the world ’s highest and most challenging peaks			1
his avalanche training programme is used to teach hundreds of students each year			0
last night members of the @entity344 arrived in @entity34 to offer assistance			0
the two @entity3 climbers who escaped had taken a different route , said sir @entity249 , the @entity3 ambassador to @entity250 , who last night arrived in @entity34 to offer assistance			1
a local official added : ‘ they were part of the original party but for some reason they changed their minds			0
they must have had some premonition			0
’ recovery : five @entity3 are said to be among those still missing from the group of 28 climbers , as helicopters rushed to the scene one of the dead @entity35 climbers was @entity364 , a 51 - year - old father of two who was an experienced climber and head of the fire services mountain rescue team at @entity122 national park			1
in a bizarre twist of fate he and another @entity35 victim had swapped places with two fellow countrymen to take part in the ill - fated trip			2
the avalanche is the worst to hit the @entity34 community since 1999 when 12 were killed in their chalets in @entity379			2
