' bunny - boiler ' @entity0 - played by @entity2 in the 1987 blockbuster she is one of @entity6 ’s most notorious female characters – a ‘ crazed harpy ’ who boils her ex-lover ’s family rabbit after he ditches her to return to his wife after a weekend affair			1
but the creator of @entity0 ’s @entity0 – played by @entity2 in the 1987 blockbuster – says the character will be seen in a far more sympathetic light when a stage adaptation of the story opens in @entity19 ’s @entity18 later this month			1
screenwriter @entity20 said he regarded it as a ‘ dubious honour ’ that the phrase ‘ bunny - boiler ’ had entered the @entity26 language as slang for an unhinged woman – and claimed he was forced to rewrite the character after pressure from studio bosses			1
his original plan was for the unfortunate rabbit to be grilled on a rotisserie , but added : ‘ somehow i do n’t think bunny broiler has quite the same ring ! ’ @entity20 sees the stage version ‘ as an opportunity to redress some of the wrongs we may , however unintentionally , have done to @entity0 ’			2
he said : ‘ i am not going to claim that she is suddenly @entity42 , nor am i suggesting that dear little floppy - eared creatures are no longer an endangered species , but i can reveal that they will not be scraping @entity0 off the bathroom tiles at the end of the play			2
‘ @entity0 is emphatically not a monster – she is a sad , tragic , lonely woman , holding down a tough job in a tough , unforgiving city			0
’ @entity20 explained why @entity0 ’s character was changed and how his original story was warped into an attack on feminism and single , career women			0
he said : ‘ @entity6 likes its leading men heroic , so gradually @entity60 ’s character @entity61 is made more blameless while @entity0 turns more and more into the villain			0
‘ the film was seen by the studio as a parable about @entity66 , a critique of the permissive society or an attack on feminism in general and single , career women – all of which could not have been further from my mind			0
’ @entity73 as a ' toned down ' @entity0 in the upcoming @entity18 production he said @entity2 was initially reluctant to take on the changes to @entity0 ’s character and that the cast of the forthcoming play – which features @entity26 actress @entity73 as @entity0 – needed convincing that it would not follow the film ’s moral outlook			1
he said : ‘ when @entity73 agreed to play @entity0 on stage for this production it was on the strict understanding – which we are more than happy to give – that this time around @entity0 will not be demonised			1
’ the play also stars @entity26 actor @entity86 as @entity61 and @entity87 as his wife			0
@entity89 opens at the @entity90 , @entity90 , on march 25 .			0
