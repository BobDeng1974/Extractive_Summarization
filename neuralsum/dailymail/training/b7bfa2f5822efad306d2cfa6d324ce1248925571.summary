@entity244 - shocked residents of @entity14 in @entity4 took a small step toward normalcy on friday after homes and businesses reopened just yards away from the lakeside town 's devastated centre			0
police erected an 8 - foot ( 2.5 - meter ) fence blocking from view what was once a downtown core of restaurants , bars and shops - but which now resembles a blackened warzone after a train pulling 72 cars of crude oil jumped the track and exploded into flames there on july 6			1
bells from the town 's main church , whose spire towers over the treetops in this normally quiet town in @entity4 's eastern hills , could be heard ringing out for the first time since the incident as residents prepared to bring in mementos of the dead for a memorial			1
' it is good to be home , even if we 're near a disaster area , ' said @entity284 , 47 , as he stood on his doorstep peering over the police barricade across the street and into the warped pile of train cars			1
in a testament to the intensity of the blast , which killed an estimated 50 people in @entity111 's worst train incident in years , the vinyl siding of nearby houses was curled outward and the leaves in the trees blackened .			1
