@entity9 believes the offender was inspired to set fire to his £ 18,000 @entity12 outside his @entity14 home after reading one of his crime - thriller novels			1
the blaze caused a small explosion and sent flames 10ft into the air			1
torched : a crime novelist 's £ 18,000 @entity2 was set alight by arsonists , pictured			1

now mr @entity9 fears he has been singled out by one of his readers following the attack at his home in @entity33 , near @entity45 , @entity14			1
he wrote on his @entity47 page : ' some of you may know that myself and my family were subject to an horrific arson attack			2

damage : the blaze caused a small explosion which also damaged the author 's wife 's mini , pictured destroyed : one of the writer 's daughters @entity65 looks at the damage			1
the author said he was ' gutted ' at the ' malicious ' attack ' in terms of my real life , it is shocking , however the police are following up numerous leads , and are confident that they will find those responsible imminently			2
' i will not allow this to intrude upon my family life or the @entity34 series			0
' he added : ' in my third book , the @entity35 , the lead character had his @entity2 blown up in the street			1
' i ’m gutted , absolutely gutted that someone had the malicious nature to do it			0
i worked very hard to get that car and it is a car i would have kept forever			2
' response : the author took to social media to express his concern about the copycat attack investigation : police are looking in to the cause of the blaze and are appealing for witnesses concern : the family say the car was the novelists ' pride and joy ' and were in ' pristine condition ' the arson attack also caused damage to mr @entity9 ’s wife ’s @entity110 car			1

it was his pride and joy and was in pristine condition			0
' police are investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses who saw a man carrying a green petrol canister running away from the property			0
an exceptionally valuable @entity139 painting , stolen from a museum in @entity141 by art thieves , turns up in the private collection of the rich and powerful @entity144			0
former army intelligence officer @entity145 investigates the crime - in a hope that his connections in the underworld will lead him to the gang			0
but after a heated conversation with mr @entity144 - where the officer not so subtly asks him where he got the painting - all hell breaks loose and his beloved @entity38 is blown up			0
more worryingly , though , is that a contract is put out on him , his lawyer girlfriend and anyone he associates with			0
but despite the threats , the officer begins to peel away the layers of a world of organised crime , gangs and even an unsolved heist that took place 25 years previously .			0
