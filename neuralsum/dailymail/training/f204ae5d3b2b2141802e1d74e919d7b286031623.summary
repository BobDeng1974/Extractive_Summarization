@entity9 , 41 , stated in court documents that @entity2 hurled anti-semitic insults at her and slammed her head against the wall
@entity16 appeals court ruled last week that @entity2 is entitled to fight for his recognition of his paternity rights
the 47 - year - old star of @entity38 was stripped of visitation rights last february when a judge sided with his ex-girlfriend
@entity16 law states that sperm donors do not have parental rights if the baby 's mother and father are no longer together
the new ruling does n't establish @entity2 's parental rights , howere it gives him a chance to fight for custody in court
@entity2 claims he signed forms at sperm clinic expressing an ' intent to parent ' and has been acting as @entity11 ' father from day one
@entity9 , 41 , insists @entity2 agreed to donate his sperm knowing that he would have no parental rights or obligations

the couple co-parented for more that a year before they split
