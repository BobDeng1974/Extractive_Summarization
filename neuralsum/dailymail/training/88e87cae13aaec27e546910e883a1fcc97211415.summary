by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 12:52 est , 23 august 2013 a hotelier has demanded an ancient clock stop chiming every 15 because it is keeping his customers awake			1
the town hall clock in @entity5 in @entity6 which has rung every 15 minutes since the 18th century is now causing a storm on @entity8 after one hotelier complained about the noise the small market town in @entity6 attracts thousands of tourists every year , but @entity13 , of @entity14 , has requested the traditional tolls be halted after dark			1
the bells ! residents of @entity5 in @entity6 are divided over whether the bells should be silenced after dark he says guests have told him that however much they love the town they will never return to @entity5 because of the clock ’s 24 - hour chiming			1
he said : ' if anyone can come up with a genuine reason why the town clock should chime every 15 minutes throughout the night then i would like to hear it			1
surly it would be beneficial to everyone living in close proximity to the clock to have it chime at most on the hour throughout the dead of night ? ' but his request to the town council has been criticised by many residents who say the chimes are ' part of @entity5 ’s character '			1
using their @entity8 site the town council asked locals to leave their opinion on the clock asking the question : ' does the noise of chiming bother people throughout the night or is it part of the ‘ deal ’ of living in a rural town with an historic town hall and clock ? ' the @entity14 owner says guests have told him that however much they love the town they will never return to @entity5 because of the bells within days they received hundreds of responses with the majority in favour of keeping the chimes			1

it is definitely part of the town and it would be a real shame to see it go			2

when i moved back here after 18 months away i really knew that i was home again when i heard the chimes			0
it has been a part of my growing up			0
' but some have sympathy with @entity13 and the guests who stay at @entity83			0
@entity84 wrote : ' i agree that it is part of town , but " never annoyed anybody ? " try having your bedroom 25 feet from it ! ' using their @entity8 site the town council has asked locals to leave their opinion on the clock because of the controversial chimes @entity97 posted : ' i doubt anyone would support complete removal of the chimes as they are part of the fabric of @entity5 life , however surely the people who are closest to it are those affected the most at four in the morning			1
i would be interested to know why turning off the chimes between 1am and 6am is such a big deal as most of us are then asleep			0
' @entity111 , a town councillor who runs a bed and breakfast in the town , has described claims that the clock chimes are having a detrimental effect on the local economy as ' absolute rubbish '			1
she said : ' @entity5 has become increasingly popular as a holiday destination over the past 20 years and numbers continue to grow			2
yet all this time the @entity123 clock has been donging away every 15 minutes , day and night			1
' @entity124 has worked hard on tourism development over the years and has always had a policy of attracting visitors for what the town and area have to offer rather than changing things to suit visitors specifically			0
any initiatives , be it good public footpaths , better signage , an excellent town website , promotion of town events and festivals and , of course , the renovation of the @entity123 should benefit residents as much as visitors			0
' altering the chiming of the @entity123 clock would go completely against this principle as most town centre residents want the clock chimes to stay as they are			1
they are a familiar and friendly background sound to our lives and , for many people , a very useful time keeper			0
without the quarters , the chimes would be useless as the latter			0
' instead of complaining about the chimes , the accommodation providers and residents should be celebrating our historic @entity123 clock			2
it is part of the character of @entity5 and appreciated by many			2
' the future of @entity5 ’s @entity123 clock will be discussed at a meeting of the full council on september 10 .			2

market town @entity5 attracts thousands of tourists
hotelier has asked clock that chimes every 15 minutes stop after dark
@entity174 divided over whether to silence the bells
