by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 12:38 est , 6 january 2014 @entity2 has launched a new version of the @entity5 black cab , featuring an engine it claims will be far more environmentally friendly than any of its rivals			1
the new taxi , which comes with a 1.6 litre petrol engine instead of the 2.5 litre diesel one fitted in the majority of the capital 's cabs , is designed to mix innovation and tradition - embracing the large round headlights and over-sized grilles that have been synonymous with @entity5 taxis for decades			1
@entity2 says the new taxi will be available to any city that wants to embrace the black cab , not just @entity5 , and although the @entity24 car giant has a large manufacturing plant in @entity26 , the vehicle will instead be built in @entity27			1
@entity28 and black : the @entity2 taxi promises to be environmentally cleaner than existing cabs , offering 32 miles to the gallon and @entity33 emissions of 132g/km			1
an electric ' zero emission ' version is to follow in 2015 the launch has stoked up a taxi - war among rival manufacturers			0
priced at around £ 30,000 , the @entity2 cab ditches diesel in favour of a frugal petrol - powered 1.6 litre six - speed automatic taxi which will be launched in december this year			1
it promises to be cleaner and greener than existing cabs , offering 32 miles to the gallon and co2 emissions of 132g/km			2
an electric - powered ' zero emission ' version of the @entity2 taxi is to follow in 2015			2
launching the ' new face ' of its taxi for @entity5 , a @entity2 spokesman said : ' it has been re-designed to make it instantly recognisable as one of the capital ’s iconic black cabs			2
' @entity2 's first stab at creating its own version of the famous @entity58 came in august 2012 when it unveiled a prototype based on its successful multi-purpose @entity61 van			0
but the taxi version did n’t quite hit the mark			0
the new @entity2 taxi will be available to any city that wants to take on the black cab			1
but despite the car manufacturer having a large plant in @entity26 , the groundbreaking vehicle will be built in @entity27 the new @entity2 taxi has been designed using ' feedback ' from a number of sources , including @entity73 and @entity74			2
strict guidelines seek to protect not only the safety and efficiency of @entity5 taxis , but also the black cab 's iconic design			1
as a result , the new @entity2 features large , round headlights and an over-sized grille to ensure it mirrors the traditional black cab look			1
elsewhere , the taxi has a 25 - foot turning circle - the minimum required by @entity74 , who insist all cabs are able to pick - up and drop - off passengers in the narrow road outside the @entity93			0
the @entity2 taxi also features a panoramic glass roof designed to appeal to tourists , antibacterial seat covers , and ultra-fast sliding doors which allow passengers to make a swift exit if they are going to be sick			1
finally @entity2 have removed cup - holders from their taxi as research suggests passengers are more likely to lose their wallets and phones in them than use them for drinks			1
so in response to ' feedback ' from @entity5 mayor @entity73 , @entity74 and other key organisations , @entity2 's @entity109 design team - who also created the best - selling @entity112 and @entity113 models - redesigned the vehicle ' to better reflect the iconic nature of the traditional black cab '			1
this included fitting round headlamps and a re-modelled grille mirroring the traditional black cab ' face ' , adding led lighting to improve visibility of the traditional taxi sign , and creating completely new front bumper panels			2
to be allowed to ply its trade in the capital , the new @entity2 taxi has to the strict @entity74 regulations governing @entity133 , including the required 25 - foot turning circle which allows it to pick - up and drop - off outside the narrow confines of the @entity93			2
a panoramic glass roof helps sight - seers , but @entity2 went further			0
@entity2 's global chief planning officer and executive vice president @entity140 , noted : ' it included fitting antibacterial seat fabric , no cup - holders because passengers leave their mobile phones in them , and sliding doors that are n’t a hazard to cyclists			1
' most practically he noted : ' they also wanted doors that can open fast in case the passenger wants to be sick			0
' expecting the worst : one of the key features of the new @entity2 taxi is an ultra-fast door release , allowing passengers to exit the vehicle quickly if they are going to be sick @entity2 stress the taxi will be available to any other town or city across the @entity161 which wants a new take on the traditional black cab			1
but although @entity2 has a big factory at @entity26 , the new taxi will be built in @entity27			0
engineers at @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity169 have worked on the cab however , and have been running real - world trials on the streets of @entity5			0
@entity2 design chief @entity173 , said : ' the main challenges were concerned with making sure customers can easily recognise it as a taxi			0
being in @entity5 , we were able to go out and talk to cabbies about what was important to them as well as look at the vehicle from a customer ’s viewpoint			0
' the mayor ’s office and taxi drivers were very keen that we maintain the character of the @entity133 , making it something that people in the city can be proud of			0
' rivals : @entity192 has entered the capital ’s taxi cab - market with its own @entity195 ( left )			0
