' there 's a farm nearby but the farmer said it could n't be his			2
' i raised him with my three dogs , so now he thinks he 's one of them			1
it 's a dog 's life : @entity5 with @entity34 the @entity35 cross			2
he prefers the company of humans rather than sheep ' most sheep do revert to their natural characteristics if they are not brought up in their natural surroundings but clearly @entity5 prefers life as a dog , ' said vet @entity60 woolly jumper : @entity5 joined the @entity61 when he was a terrified lamb			0

baa - rk : ms @entity20 said @entity5 is always trying to get her attention and is constantly getting up to mischief and everywhere that ms @entity20 went ... her @entity5 was sure to go she added : ' he gets really excited when we take him out in the van for a walk down the country lanes			0
' he wriggles around and starts screwing his nose up ' when we swing open the back doors , he 's standing there panting and looking really pleased with himself			0
' he loves a little swim now and again too - it 's quite amazing to see him dive in for a quick dip			1
' vet @entity60 said : ' sheep are more intelligent than some people think and they are very capable of learned behaviour			0
