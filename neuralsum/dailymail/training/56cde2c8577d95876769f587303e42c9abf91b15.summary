by @entity0 published : 15:49 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 03:18 est , 19 september 2012 braving extreme temperatures as he pushes the limits of human endurance , sir @entity1 has few opportunities to worry about his appearance			1

speaking at the @entity20 in october 2009 - the year he became the oldest @entity22 to reach the summit of @entity25 - sir @entity1 had no more than a few strands to keep him warm			1

bravery : sir @entity1 was the first person to cross the @entity95 on foot and in 2009 he became the oldest @entity22 to climb @entity25 - despite having a heart condition and a fear of heights natural look : sir @entity1 in 1961 , left , and in 1993 , right , when he became one of the first men to walk unaided across the great frozen continent frozen stiff : sir @entity1 , right , once had such bad frostbite that he amputated his fingers himself ' our caboose will be bristling with scientific instruments , for @entity110 , for the @entity111			1
' no doubt the bristles will also include those on a hairbrush , after the adventurer apparently decided to recapture his youth with a new head of hair			2
