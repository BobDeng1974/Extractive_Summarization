aviation ministers are ‘ stalling ’ over controversial plans to build more runways , angry critics warned today in a new row			2
status quo : today 's announcement will see see noise restrictions extended at @entity8 for three years it came as transport secretary @entity10 kicked into the long grass a recommendation by the government ’s ‘ airports ‘ @entity18 ’ sir @entity15 for the creation of a new @entity17 - saying a decision on this would be ‘ more appropriate ’ after next may ’s election			1
instead , noise and night - flight restrictions at three of @entity25 ’s busiest airports are to be extended by three years while ministers ponder where to build a controversial new runway			1
existing restrictions at @entity8 , @entity31 and @entity32 will continue until october 2017 , he said			1
campaigners said the government ’s response was ‘ deeply disappointing ’ , and said mr @entity10 had sought to ‘ bury ’ bad news behind the excitement of today 's re-shuffle , and to ‘ kick the can down the road for another year ’			2
they also expressed dismay that the @entity10 was ‘ stalling ’ , and had failed to explicitly back the need for at least one extra runway in the @entity44 of @entity45 - which sir @entity15 ’s @entity46 says is needed			2
at close quarters : a decision over a possible third runway at @entity8 has been left hanging by today 's news the argument is over whether it should be at @entity8 , @entity31 or the increasingly unlikely ‘ @entity56 ’ plan for the @entity55			1
but the @entity46 ’s final recommendation on this matter will be left for the winner of next may ’s general election to implement – or not			0
announcing the government ’s response to the @entity46 ’s interim report published back in december , mr @entity10 told @entity64 in a written statement : ‘ in relation to the commission ’s recommendation for an @entity17 , the government believes that it would be more appropriate to consider the role for such a body alongside the commission ’s final recommendations on long term capacity			1
‘ instead he said : ‘ the government is confirming today that we will be maintaining the existing restrictions on night flights at @entity8 , @entity31 and @entity32 airports for a further three years until october 2017 , as well as extending the ban on rare movements made by older , noisier types of aircraft			1
’ mr @entity10 said this decision ‘ will help give certainty around the night noise environment for those living near the airports , as well as ensuring that operational capacity at these airports is not affected pending decisions on any new airport capacity in light of the commission ’s final report			1
‘ with an eye to the rows that noise has caused in the past , he said : ‘ the government is conscious of the potential concerns of those living near the sites that have been shortlisted for future runway development			2
however , the government is also mindful that introducing inappropriate measures too early has the potential to increase uncertainty and create other negative outcomes			2
‘ in the frame : @entity107 airports @entity31 and @entity32 have also been considered as options for new runways decisions on trials of using departure runways for early morning ‘ schedule smoothing ’ at @entity8 should also be considered later , and ‘ in the context of the commission ’s recommendations on long term capacity ’ , he said			1
mr @entity10 added that the government has been working with the promoters of the shortlisted runway schemes to determine when ‘ blight ’ measures might be put in place to address concerns and what these measures could consist of			2
@entity128 , director of the ‘ @entity132 ’ campaign backed by major businesses said : ‘ they are stalling			0
we are disappointed that the government has failed to make any progress on the early establishment of an independent aircraft noise authority			2
‘ we think a new body is fundamental to ensuring that we build cross-party support for airport expansion			0
this should be established as soon as possible			0
‘ he added : ‘ furthermore instead of bold political leadership , the government has decided to kick the can down the road for another year			0
‘ we so desperately need a clear direction of travel and an in - principle commitment to build additional runways to boost our international connectivity and secure future jobs , growth and prosperity			0
instead , we have yet more political procrastination			0
’ transport secretary @entity10 ( left ) has been accused of ' stalling ' in today 's announcement campaigners also accused the minister of trying top ‘ bury ’ bad news behind the re-shuffle : ‘ it is also regrettable that the government have decided to release a statement on an issue of strategic national importance on the day of the reshuffle			1
when @entity10 created the @entity46 , he rightly pointed out that ' the reality is that , since the 1960s , @entity25 has failed to keep pace with our international competitors in addressing long term aviation capacity and connectivity needs ' , and emphasised the urgent need to put that right			1
' sadly , the only consequence of today 's statement is that the @entity25 will drop still further off the pace			1
’ @entity178 , chief executive of business leaders ' group @entity179 , said : ‘ after seven months of waiting , the government has failed to rise to the challenge set by the commission in its interim report ’			0
she added : ‘ it will be over a decade before we have a new runway serving @entity107 , if we 're lucky , and this was a great chance to hear how the government will make best use of the airports we have to boost our global reach			0
‘ instead we have no short - term plans to make the rail link to @entity32 world - class , and no plans to attract airlines and passengers to grow our global air links			1
’ @entity202 continued : ‘ there is no detail about an independent aviation noise authority , to bring new levels of trust around airports that more flights will mean less noise , and no certainty over proposals to cut flight delays at @entity8			1
’ mr @entity214 said the @entity215 ( sdg ) , whose first report is also published today , was setting pit plans expected to deliver annual benefits of more than £ 150million to the aviation industry and environment by 2020 , and more than £ 2billion worth of cumulative benefits by 2030			0
mr @entity10 said : ‘ we are taking steps now to make the best use of what we already have , and looking at what more can be done in the short to medium term while the @entity46 prepares its recommendations on the best options in the long run			0
‘ as we have said before , it will be for the government of the day to respond to the commission 's recommendations once it publishes its final report in summer 2015			0
’ the government set up the @entity46 in september 2012 to advise on the need for , and the location of , future runways			0
the @entity46 will decide in the autumn whether or not to shortlist an estuary option , before launching a formal consultation on the final shortlisted options ahead of its final recommendations in summer 2015 .			0

new government announcement fails to rule on new airport in south - east
@entity8 , @entity31 , @entity32 and ' @entity56 ' are all under consideration
critics say lack of new air capacity means @entity25 is falling behind the world
