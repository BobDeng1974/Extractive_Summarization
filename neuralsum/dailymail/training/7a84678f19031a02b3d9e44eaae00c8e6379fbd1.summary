the eccentric millionaire , 67 , is currently believed to be on the run in @entity16 with a 20 - year - old female companion called @entity18 and two journalists from the arts and culture magazine @entity21			1
a post on his own blog , uploaded over the weekend , claimed he had been arrested attempting to cross into @entity26 , although officials in @entity9 denied this was the case			1
the post reads : ' we are not in @entity9 , but not quite out of the woods yet			2
i will do a more detailed posting later today if all goes well			0
' my " double " , carrying on ( sic ) a @entity8 passport under my name , was in fact detained in @entity26 for pre-planned misbehavior , but due to indifference on the part of authorities was evicted from the jail and was unable to serve his intended purpose in our exit plan			1
' he is now safely out of @entity26			2
' it is not known whether there is any truth in these claims or indeed if the posts were uploaded by @entity5 himself			1
where in the world is he ? a new photo published online today appears to show that @entity5 is in @entity16 is the game up ? several @entity76 followers quickly noticed that the metadata in @entity21 's photo showed its location in @entity16 @entity5 did not describe the entire plan , nor did he say where exactly he was now			1

' i 'm not going to leave this country , ' he said			0
' i love this country , this is my home			0

he titled this photo ' new friends ' on the run : @entity5 , seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor , claims he is being set up by the @entity9 government the photo of vice editor @entity129 alongside @entity5 , included metadata pinpointing their exact location to a @entity16 mansion surrounded by forest at the edge of the sea			1
however the millionaire then quickly posted on his blog an ' apology ' to @entity21 for manipulating their photo 's location for his own safety			0
in an email , @entity5 confirmed a posting to his website in which he described , in what appeared to be joking tones , how he mounted the ruse			2
in monday 's post , @entity5 said he left @entity9 because he thought ' @entity18 ' , the young @entity9 woman who has accompanied him since he went on the lam , was in danger			1
he wrote : ' i left @entity9 because of a series of events which led both @entity18 and i to believe that she was in danger of capture			2
she has been my go - between and my eyes and ears in the outside world			0
' i decided to make the move			0
i will be returning to @entity9 after i have place ( sic ) @entity18 in a safe position			2

' @entity5 and @entity97 repeatedly had run - ins with each other the dogs that the multi-millionaire owned and in one interview with @entity303 claimed that the killers of mr @entity97 were looking for him in fact and not his unfortunate neighbou			0
in fact , the last six months have proven to be one odd episode after another for @entity5 , which began in may when his home was raided and police said they found multiple firearms and the 67 - year - old living with a 17 - year - old girl			0
