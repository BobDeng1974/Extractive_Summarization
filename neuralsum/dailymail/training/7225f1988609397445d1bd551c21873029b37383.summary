by @entity0 published : 07:38 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 08:42 est , 9 november 2012 insurers could be hit for billions of dollars more than expected after superstorm @entity2 was labelled a post-tropical cyclone rather than a hurricane			1
lowering the classification means the insurance providers have to pay more of the costs towards rebuilding the parts of @entity10 and @entity11 which were damaged			2
had @entity2 been given hurricane status homeowners would have needed to contribute more towards their costs			1
total rebuild : insurers will have to pay for houses like these , in area near the coast which burned down during a fire in the midst of the storm , to be rebuilt without claiming hurricane deductions the @entity23 's @entity22 ( @entity22 ) made the call which has been contested by insurers , who are estimated to lose between $ 10 - 20billion			1
' in @entity10 , @entity11 , by all sorts of normal measures , it was a hurricane , ' @entity27 , senior vice-president of state and policy affairs at the @entity30 , told the @entity35			2
' if you ask any one who lives [ in @entity10 or @entity11 ] they will tell you it was a hurricane			2
' he continued : ' it ’s ironic that the industry gets beaten up all the time about the way it hides behind policy language			0
torn to pieces : a girl tries to recover some items from her parents house which was destroyed in the storm ' it seems to me that this is what the states are doing : they ’re hiding behind this technicality			0
' however they may succeed in their bid to challenge the determination of @entity2			1
@entity62 , an attorney at the @entity63 , told the @entity35 : ' most courts would have to take judicial notice of the determinations of @entity23 and the post tropical declaration would be upheld			0
' however , because so much money is involved , i would not be surprised to see the determination challenged			0
' a hurricane deductible is usually between 1 per cent and 5 per cent of the value of the property - which means homeowners would have to pay thousands of dollars before the insurers covered the rest			0
shattered : homeowner @entity76 stands at a wall of windows damaged by @entity2 to watch snow fall but a storm deductible is usually a fixed figure between $ 500 and $ 1000 - considerably less			1
for instance , if a house was valued at $ 400,000 a hurricane deductible could cost up to $ 20,000			0
the @entity10 , @entity86 , @entity11 , @entity87 , @entity88 and the @entity90 jurisdictions have all already declared hurricane deductibles invalid			1
individual insurance companies use different ways to decide whether storms are classified as hurricanes or not			1
some use the @entity22 decision while others decide on an observed wind speed			0
the @entity22 's @entity100 says a hurricane is a tropical cyclone or rotating wind system with a minimum sustained surface wind speed of 74mph			2
still standing : this house fared better than many during the storm which hit land at 8pm on october 29 even though maximum sustained wind speeds with @entity2 were at 85mph when the classification changed the storm was downgraded because it had ' lost its tropical characteristics ' , according to the @entity100			2
they labelled it a post-tropical cyclone at 7pm on october 29 - an hour before it hit land			0
last week governors across the @entity118 states hit by @entity2 said insurance companies should not charge hurricane deductibles			1
@entity10 governor @entity121 said : ' homeowners should not have to pay hurricane deductibles for damage caused by the storm and insurers should understand the @entity127 will be monitoring how claims are handled			0

insurance companies are contesting the decision to change @entity2 's status
some jurisdictions have already said hurricane deductions are invalid
