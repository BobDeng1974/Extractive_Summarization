by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 08:50 est , 16 october 2013 older sisters make better confidants than a parents , friends or relatives for teenage girls , a new study has found			1
in particular , adolescent girls going through problems with romance , sex and other sensitive issues make better choices when they have an older sister to confide in			1
researchers from the @entity16 in @entity17 recorded conversations between volunteer family members , talking about health , sex and their worries			2
sisters like @entity24 and @entity25 are likely to have the same views and ideas , having grown up in the same environment , the study suggests they found teenage girls were most open when discussing issues with an older sister while the older sister was the most useful in dispensing the right advice and guidance			1
in general girls tend to identify with other girls as they are most likely to have had the same types of experience , and so confide in them			2
however it may be easier with a sister than , for example , a friend , because they are likely to have the same views and ideas , having grown up in the same environment , the study suggests			0
in return , the older sister can give the best advice - whether it is about contraception to romantic feelings - because she will have been through it and made both right and wrong choices			1
the study , published in the specialist journal @entity54 , was led by @entity55 , assistant professor of human development at @entity16			1
she said : ' our findings indicate that sisters play important roles as adolescent girls form ideas about romantic relationships and sexuality			0
it may be that @entity66 acts as a role model to her younger sister @entity68 , who has also chosen to be an actress ' sisters are important communication partners when it comes to these sensitive topics			1
' the study suggests that older sisters should be included in family planning programmes aimed at teenagers , particular over issues like practicing safe sex			0
conversations between sisters are more intimate and more likely to get to the root of an issue , said the researchers			0
older sisters ask more pertinent questions , for instance , which in turn produces more revealing disclosures by the younger girl , they found			0
additionally an older sister is much more likely to serve as a role model than a parent or friend , it added			1
@entity55 said : ' given their age , older sisters were more likely to have advice to share and have romantic relationships and sexual experiences from which their younger sisters can learn			0
' having a role model also means learning from their mistakes , she added			2
' younger sisters frequently commented on their older sisters ' negative experiences , such as teen pregnancy and abusive relationships , and made decisions to be different			0
' learning only from negative experiences could occur because younger sisters only consciously identify the experiences of their sisters that they do not want to repeat			0

study by @entity16 was published in the journal @entity54
found girls make better decisions if they have an older sister to confide in
most open when talking to their sister , and older *sibling* acts as role model
