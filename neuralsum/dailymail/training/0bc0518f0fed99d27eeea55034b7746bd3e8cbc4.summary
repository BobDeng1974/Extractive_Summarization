a crisis - hit hospital has been cleared of deliberately manipulating cancer waiting times - with a review finding any failings were the result of managerial incompetence , not corruption			1
@entity9 in @entity10 , which is in special measures and was forced to declare a major incident last month , had been subject to two separate but related inquiries after concerns were raised by the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , who inspect hospitals , in november last year			1
the first looked into alleged manipulation of cancer waiting times while the second focused on claims staff were bullied into changing data so that the hospital appeared to be meeting targets			1
while the review published today found no evidence of systematic data manipulation , it did find evidence of poor documentation and record - keeping and identified a number of patients who had experienced sub-optimal care , diagnosis or treatment			1
scandal hit @entity37 ( pictured ) has been cleared of deliberately manipulating cancer waiting times in a report published today the report said that it was impossible to establish the extent to which patients suffered as a result but there was evidence of clear harm to at least one patient			1
dr @entity48 , chief executive of @entity37 , said she hoped the findings would allow staff to focus on improving services			0
she added : ' i welcome the publication of this report and i am very pleased there appears to be no evidence of systematic data manipulation at the trust			1
' it is important that we now rebuild confidence in the cancer services provided here in @entity9			2
' we apologise unreservedly to any of our patients who have suffered delays in treatment or diagnosis or who have received poor care			1
' we have scrutinised the care of any patient where we think there might have been imperfect care and the trust is in contact with all of the patients who have suffered significant sub-optimal care			0
' we are continuing to work with our health partners to improve the quality of our cancer services			0
' allegations of bullying and waiting list manipulation at the @entity37 was passed to the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) in the summer of 2013			2
on investigation the @entity15 identified “ serious concerns ” and said staff reported to the @entity15 that they were “ pressured to change data … to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines ”			2
the @entity37 commissioned two reviews of the experience of a number of patients treated between april 2010 and march 2014 who may have been affected by misreporting			0
it found 16 cases of possible deliberate and inappropriate data entry but in none of these cases could the reviewers establish intent to deliberately falsify the figures			0
the review found a number of small discrepancies between recorded and actual patient data and concluded that these were most likely to be the result of minor , but erroneous interpretations of the guidelines governing cancer waiting times			1
these discrepancies sometimes made waiting times appear longer than in reality and sometimes shorter			1
while the review found no evidence of systematic , deliberate data manipulation it did find evidence of poor documentation and record keeping with multiple causes including data entry errors , misinterpretation of national guidance , operating process issues , poor information sharing and poor record keeping			1
it also identified a number of patients who had experienced suboptimal care , diagnosis or treatment			1
the retrospective review , commissioned by the trust , look at 822 cancer patients treated at the hospital between 2010 and 2014			2
it was launched after the @entity15 raised ' serious concerns ' about staff being pressured to change data to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines			2
under national targets , patients with suspected cancer must start their treatment within 62 days of a gp referral			2
any patient found to have cancer should start treatment within 31 days , according to the @entity154			2
various specialities at the hospital , particularly those dealing with urology and lower gastrointestinal cancer , were at risk of breaching the required standard and it was alleged that data had been altered to address these concerns			0
the report found 16 cases of possible deliberate and inappropriate data entry but the reviewers could not firmly establish intent to deliberately falsify figures			0
the @entity171 , which reviewed the report , said : ' the overarching impression was there was evidence of inaccuracies in the cancer waits data but this was as likely to negatively impact on the trust 's performance statistics as enhance them			1
' this suggested the issue was one of effectiveness and competence in the cancer management team rather than a deliberate manipulation			0
' the independent inquiry into bullying and intimidation was commissioned under the instruction of health regulator monitor , which oversaw the process			0
while some staff members had said they felt ' pressured ' to manipulate data , the report said there had been no systematic culture of bullying			1
@entity201 , regional director at @entity193 , said the report should ' bring a very difficult chapter in the history of this trust to a close '			0
the review did identify a number of patients who had received sub optimal care , diagnosis or treatment ( file photo ) ' it is reassuring to find that there is no evidence of staff being bullied into changing cancer data , but it is even clearer that there were serious managerial failures at the trust , ' he added			1
' the new management team at the hospital is already delivering improvements for patients - a process we expect to see continue			0
' @entity231 , the trust 's chairman , said : ' although this report found no evidence of a systemic culture of bullying , this trust takes bullying very seriously and will take prompt action wherever and whenever bullying is identified			1
' the trust said it had made a number of improvements to its cancer services over the last year			0
a spokesman said it had also made ' significant strides ' in improving data collection and handling for cancer patients			0
the trust 's cancer mortality statistics are now within the normal national range for @entity154 trusts in @entity253			0
bosses declared a major incident last month - which included cancelling operations and telling patients to stay away from @entity258 - after @entity15 inspectors said staff were under strain and patient care was suffering as a result			0
the trust has since resumed normal service after reducing the number of beds in its under - pressure @entity268 to allow staff to focus on priority cases .			0

today 's review found no evidence of systematic data manipulation
no systematic bullying was found , though some staff felt pressured
