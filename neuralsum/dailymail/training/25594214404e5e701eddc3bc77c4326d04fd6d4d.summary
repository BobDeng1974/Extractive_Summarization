3d printing has been used to make everything from toys and plaster casts to parts for jet engines			0
and now one @entity7 automotive company has unveiled a revolutionary conceptual car body that it claims will only be made possible by using what is termed as ' additive manufacturing ' or large - scale 3d printing			2
the internal structure is inspired by the shape of a turtle skeleton and is designed so that it will provide incredible protection and cushioning , just like the animal ’s shell			1
its structure is inspired by the shape of a turtle shell and is designed to provide protection and cushioning			2
in the future the car 's internal body could be made using high - resolution fuse deposition modelling ( @entity41 ) machines			2
the internal structure would be @entity11 printed using a mixture of thermoplastic materials and carbon fibre			1
a metal casing would shield the @entity11 printed internal frame			1
experts believe the concept is over a decade away from becoming reality			0
in the future the car body could be made in one piece using high - resolution fuse deposition modelling ( @entity41 ) machines and then sheathed in metal to protect it			2
@entity25 ’s ‘ @entity57 ’ concept has gone on show at the @entity59 , which is focused on the future of car design			1
the car body is intended to be built using 3d printing and a mixture of carbon fibre and plastic			1
the company says its concept is ‘ designed to demonstrate the revolutionary potential of additive manufacturing			0
’ the structure ( illustrated bottom ) is inspired by the shape of a turtle shell and is designed so that it will provide protection and cushioning , just like the animal 's shell ( pictured top ) in the future the car body ( illustrated ) could be made in one piece using high - resolution fuse deposition modelling ( @entity41 ) machines @entity25 claims that cars based on organic structures ‘ can not be built using conventional tools ’			1
the firm believes that 3d printers will one day manufacture a car 's entire body and envision a continuous strand of carbon fibre being used within the printing process , helping to create an ultra- strong outer shell of a vehicle in one piece			1
while hi - tech plastic might seem like an odd choice of material to build a car ’s body from , the company said : ‘ unlike other technologies , @entity41 makes it possible for components of almost any size to be produced , as there are no pre-determined space requirements to pose any restrictions			0
' instead , the structures are generated by having robots apply thermoplastic materials			0
’ cars need to be strong to withstand collisions so the @entity7 firm plans to introduce ' endless carbon fibres ' to the 3d printed frame ( illustrated ) during the production process , which they say will give the body the strength and stiffness needed cars need to be strong to withstand collisions so the @entity7 firm plans to introduce ‘ endless carbon fibres ’ during the production process , which they say will give the body the strength and stiffness needed			1
designers used a turtle shell to inspire the shape of the car body to create a body that ‘ cushions and supports ’ an interior carriage , surrounded by reinforcing metals for an outer shell			0
designers used a turtle shell to inspire the shape of the car body to create a body that ' cushions and supports ' an interior carriage , surrounded by reinforcing metals ( illustrated ) experts believe the concept is over a decade away from becoming reality , but production of components is feasible at the moment			0
‘ as for the target of using additive manufacturing to produce complete vehicle bodies , there is still a long way to go before this becomes an industrial application , so for the time being , it remains a vision , ’ the firm said			0

@entity7 auto firm @entity25 unveiled concept car at the @entity59
its internal frame is designed to be @entity11 printed from a mixture of thermo - plastic materials and carbon fibre for strength and cushioning
a conventional metal frame , also inspired by a shell , would protect the @entity11 printed internal structure
