by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 07:36 est , 13 february 2013 teetering precariously on the edge of a busy motorway bridge the scene of a lorry hanging terrifyingly close to taking a tumble off the @entity6 looked strangely familiar			1
passers by would have been forgiven for being reminded of the famous cliffhanger scene at the end of cult crime caper @entity10			1
but instead of gold bars , the lorry was stacked high with ten tons of food when it came off the main northbound carriageway at @entity15 , @entity16 , this morning			1
the road passing under the bridge was closed off by quick thinking passers - by following the incident between junctions 41 and 42 at around 8.25am			2
the area was then cordoned off properly by police , with two lanes of the motorway shut off			0
officers are still trying to work out how the truck came to be stuck on the edge of the bridge and are appealing for witnesses			0
perched : the lorry , which was carrying a ten tonne cargo , crashed between junctions 41 and 42			2
all three wheels on the nearside of the trailer are hanging over the edge of the bridge quick thinking : the road passing under the bridge was closed by members of the public working nearby before being fully cordoned off by police the scene was reminiscent of the thrilling climax of @entity60 's much - loved 1969 film starring sir @entity61 and @entity62			1
the classic literally ends on a cliffhanger with the heist gang 's getaway vehicle left hanging over the edge of a vast precipice			1
members of the gang are all stuck at one end of the coach with the gold at the other			0
sir @entity61 's character @entity75 attempts to crawl towards the gold in an attempt to salvage it but to no avail			0
precarious : the lorry , which was carrying food , is perched above another road cliffhanger : the end scene of the 1969 cult crime caper @entity10 desperate : sir @entity61 's character @entity75 makes a vain grab for the gold in the film he utters that famous final line ' hang on a minute lads , i 've got a great idea ' and the credits roll			1
@entity61 ended almost four decades of debate by revealing the ending of the film in 2008			2
he said that his character goes back to the front of the coach , starts the engine and the gang wait for four hours until the petrol runs out			0
the balance of the coach changes with the weight of the fuel gone and the gang are able to jump off leaving the gold to crash down the cliff and the watching rival mafia gang to make off with it .			0
