by @entity0 last updated at 12:55 am on 16th december 2011 at 24 and a half , @entity1 is way too advanced in years to be learning any new tricks			2
but as probably the oldest dog in the world – and most certainly in her home county of @entity7 – she already has plenty of tricks under her belt – or rather her collar			1
the terrier - whippet cross is believed to have become the most senior canine after the death of a 26 - year - old pet in @entity16 earlier this month			1
pip with her owner @entity17			0
the highly - trained hound still performs with 18 other dogs in the @entity21 and @entity1 has lived a life that most young pups could only dream of			1
jumping through hoops of fire , sniffing out weapons and even meeting royalty , she has packed a lot into her 170 dog years			2
she is still a key member of a display team for whom she has performed 1,000 times , and was singled out for praise by the @entity34 after the @entity35 at @entity36 in 1997			0
@entity1 took the mantle of the world ’s oldest dog after the death of a @entity42 mix in @entity16 called @entity43			1
but she still has a while to go before she can lay claim to being the oldest recorded dog in history – a title held by @entity49 , an @entity51 cattle dog who was 29 when he died in 1939			1
@entity1 ’s owner @entity17 , 36 , of @entity54 , @entity7 , said : ‘ it is wonderful to know that she is the oldest dog in the world but the main thing for me is her quality of life			1
royalty : @entity1 is pictured meeting meeting the @entity63			0
her age in human years stands at a jaw - dropping 170 and she will celebrate another birthday in june talented : @entity1 jumping through flaming hoops in 2004			0
she has worked as a display dog for 23 years and has hundreds of fans ‘ she has the right amount of exercise and a very good diet but she is a little old lady now so she needs her time to relax and does have problems with her eye - sight and hearing			2
’ miss @entity17 ’s father @entity76 , 68 , said : ‘ after the team performed for the @entity34 , @entity34 said “ mr @entity78 , that was absolutely brilliant ”			0
’ as well as her weapon - hunting and fire - jumping activities with the @entity21 , @entity1 has been helping children overcome their fear of dogs			0
she is unlikely to get in the official records because @entity78 does not have a birth certificate for her , having taken her on at one when she needed re-homing			0
old ladies : for the past 20 years @entity1 , left , has been helping children with a fear of dogs			0
