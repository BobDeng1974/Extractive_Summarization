after 30 years as a pilot , captain @entity0 got to fly with a co-pilot he knew more than most			1
the pilot , who has clocked up more than 15,500 hours of flying during his career , made a special announcement to passengers travelling from @entity7 to @entity8 to tell them he was flying with his daughter			1
senior first officer @entity10 has been flying for six years but has never before got to work her father who first inspired her to fly when she was 18			2
captain @entity0 ( left ) and his daughter senior first officer @entity10 flew together for the first time mr @entity0 inspired his daughter ( pictured with her father as a child ) to take to the skies when she was just 18 ' it 's a dream come true to be able to fly with my @entity21 - even if he was still checking up on me , ' said @entity22 in the @entity23			1
the father - daughter pairing at the controls was a fluke but miss @entity10 said she hopes she will be able to fly with her father again before he retires			2
it had seemed unlikely the pair would ever co-pilot the same aircraft because miss @entity10 learned to fly on @entity31 planes when she joined the company in 2009 , and her father flew boeings			1
however when miss @entity10 took a break from @entity35 to work for another company her father retrained to work on the @entity31 fleet and the pair were able to co-pilot their first flight			1
miss @entity10 , 30 , became interesting in flying when her father got her a trial flight for her 18th birthday			2
she said : ' becoming a pilot was never something i had considered , even though @entity21 had been a pilot since before i was born			0
the father and daughter flying team made their dream a reality after mr @entity0 trained to fly an @entity31 mr @entity0 told passengers aboard the @entity31 that the flight on february 6 was a special one for him miss @entity10 ( pictured in yellow headband ) said she had never thought about flying until she went on a trial ' it was only when my @entity21 bought me trial flight as a birthday present that i got the bug			1
' but i was already preparing to go to university so i headed off to study sport and exercise science like i 'd always planned			0
' it was only when i graduated four years later that i considered following in my @entity21 's footsteps			0
' i applied for a flying course and spent 14 months in southern @entity67 getting my license and then started with @entity35 in 2009			2
miss @entity10 has been flying for six years and her father ( right ) has more than 20 years experience as a pilot 2006 - graduated from @entity71 2007 - 2008 - training in @entity67 at flight training @entity73 2009 – joined @entity35 as a cadet nov 2011 – promoted to senior first officer at @entity35 dec 2013 – went to fly for @entity77 for one year dec 2014 – returned to @entity35 1977 – graduated from @entity78 1979 - 81 – @entity80 training at @entity81 after working as accountant 1985 - @entity83 1992 - @entity84 which became @entity85 and merged with @entity35			1
2014 - @entity86 to fly an @entity31 craft , similar to the craft his daughter flies feb 2015 - first flight with his daughter miss @entity10 said her father inspired her to train to become a pilot and her mother had encouraged them both ' @entity21 and i are really similar - he had n't planned on being a pilot at the beginning either and was an accountant before but @entity101 encouraged us both			1
' the pair are the first father - daughter team at @entity35 , but miss @entity10 said she is not surprised			2
she added : ' female pilots are still very unusual			0
the airline industry is still a bit of a mystery for some people and nationally just three per cent of pilots are women			0
' the pair finally sat in the cockpit together on february 6 and mr @entity0 , who has been a training captain for 23 years , made an announcement to passengers that the flight made it a special day for him as he was flying with his daughter			1
the father - daughter flying - duo found themselves in the cockpit together because of a quirk in the roster after a hassle - free flight both said they hoped to fly together again on a @entity35 flight in the future miss @entity127 added : ' i thought that @entity21 would have retired by the time i got back to work and so we thought that we 'd never get the opportunity			1
' but after just a year i went back to work , and in the time away @entity21 had retrained on the @entity31			0
' it was only my second flight back that it just popped up on the rota that we were due to fly together , simply by chance			0
' it was quite a surprise because @entity21 's based in @entity7 and my base is @entity139 , but when we realise i was so pleased i 'd finally get to fulfil my wish			0
' miss @entity10 said she was initially nervous flying with her father and said it was like going for a driving lesson with him			0
however the flight went smoothly and both hope to repeat the experience .			0

captain @entity0 has worked as pilot for @entity35 for over 30 years
he inspired his daughter @entity22 to join and learn to fly herself in 2009
she flew @entity31 and her father boeings so working together was unlikely
@entity156 in the roster meant father and daughter *shared* cockpit this month
mr @entity0 made announcement to passengers that it was a special flight
he told those travelling to @entity8 he was flying with his daughter
