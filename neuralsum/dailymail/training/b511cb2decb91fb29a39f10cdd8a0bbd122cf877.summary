by @entity0 published : 14:02 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 21 november 2013 a martian meteorite dug up by @entity3 tribesmen in the @entity4 dates back almost 4.5 billion years and could contain the secret to the red planet once harbouring life			2
the rock is believed to be the oldest recognised sample of soil from @entity11 and holds a wealth of information about its origin and age			1
it also provides clues about the release of volatiles - chemicals linked to a planet 's water - with evidence about the first 100 million years of the planet 's existence			1
a meteorite from @entity26 called @entity27 7533 may be the first recognized example of ancient @entity11 crust , according to data presented in @entity31 this week using spectrometers - which can identify thousands of different chemicals - scientists discovered high concentrations of trace metals such as iridium which showed the sample is the first to come from @entity11 ' southern highlands			1
the meteorite called @entity27 7533 after its landing spot of @entity26 was part of a celestial rock that broke up on entering @entity46 's atmosphere producing at least five recovered stones			0
another sample - known as 7034 and nicknamed ' @entity48 ' - was dated earlier this year at 2.1 billion years old but the new age of 4.4 billion years is based on minerals called zircons providing evidence of an early differentiation of the @entity11 crust in the first 100 million years of its history			1
professor @entity56 said : ' the early magmatic build - up of the @entity11 highland crust requires an equally rapid release of volatiles from the @entity11 interior - forming the early atmosphere and hydrosphere ( water found on , under and over the surface ) - with implications for early @entity11 climate and biological potential			1
' the fist - sized meteorite nicknamed @entity48 , could unlock vital clues to the evolution of @entity11 from the warm and wet place it once was to its current cold and dry state like @entity46 the red planet is ' differentiated ' in it has a central core of metallic iron and nickel surrounded by a less dense , silicate mantle and crust			1
its distinctive colour is due to the oxidation of iron on its surface			0
it might not just be men who are from @entity11 - a recent study suggests that all life on @entity46 began on the red planet too			1
an element believed to be crucial to the origin of life would only have been available on the surface of @entity11 , it is claimed			1
geochemist professor @entity96 has argued that the ' seeds ' of life probably arrived on @entity46 in meteorites blasted off @entity11 by impacts or volcanic eruptions			0
as evidence , he points to the oxidised mineral form of the element molybdenum , thought to be a catalyst that helped organic molecules develop into the first living structures			0
‘ in addition , recent studies show that these conditions , suitable for the origin of life , may still exist on @entity11 , ’ said professor @entity96 , of the @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110			2
‘ it ’s only when molybdenum becomes highly oxidised that it is able to influence how early life formed			0
‘ this form of molybdenum could n’t have been available on @entity46 at the time life first began , because three billion years ago the surface of the @entity46 had very little oxygen , but @entity11 did			2
‘ it ’s yet another piece of evidence which makes it more likely life came to @entity46 on a @entity11 meteorite , rather than starting on this planet			2
’ the zircons in the meteorite were probably formed by re-melting of the original @entity11 crust , says professor @entity134			0
their similarity with the earliest terrestrial and lunar zircons suggests @entity11 ' crust form at the same time as @entity46 and @entity140			0
professor @entity134 , if @entity142 , said : ' this cratered terrain has been long thought to hold the keys to @entity11 ' birth and early childhood			0
' this date is about 100 million years after the first dust condensed in the solar system			1
' we now know @entity11 had a crust within the first 100 million years of the start of planet building and its crust formed concurrently with the oldest crusts on @entity46 and the @entity140			1
' the researchers , who findings are published in the journal nature , were also able to calculate the thickness of the planet 's crust and say their trailblazing discoveries are just the tip of the iceberg			2
further studies could reveal more clues about the impact history of @entity11 , the nature of @entity11 zircons and the make - up of the earliest sediments on the @entity11			2
leading meteorite expert prof @entity172 , of @entity173 , who reviewed the study , said : ' the real surprise is the ancient age reported for @entity27 7533 - 4.4 billion years - demonstrating it is a sample of the earliest @entity11 crust			1
" many of the @entity11 meteorites that exist today have been found in the @entity4 by @entity3 tribesmen who know the rocks can fetch a pretty price in the marketplace of @entity185			0
and that 's where the five stones eventually surfaced			0
three were bought by a wealthy @entity190 collector while at least one was bought by a @entity192 who suspected it was somehow different and sent it to @entity195 via a museum in @entity197			0
since its discovery @entity48 's value has jumped from $ 50 a gram to $ 15,000 a gram - and now could soar			0
