by @entity0 tens of thousands of people are putting themselves at risk of stroke by dismissing early warning signs as a ‘ funny turn ’ , experts say			2
mini-strokes – also known as transient ischaemic attacks ( @entity10 ) – are often a precursor to a potentially fatal major stroke			2
common symptoms such as arm weakness , slurred speech and blurred vision are often written off by sufferers as sciatica or a migraine			2
patients often dismiss symptoms such as arm weakness , slurred speech and blurred vision as having a ' funny turn ' ( picture posed by models ) however , one in 12 people who have a @entity10 will go on to suffer a full - blown stroke within a week			1
every year , 46,000 people in @entity28 have a mini-stroke for the first time			1
if these were treated properly , around 10,000 strokes a year could be prevented and the @entity32 could save more than £ 200million , according to the @entity34 ’s report , not just a @entity35			1
@entity36 , chief executive of the @entity34 , said : ‘ the greatest risk of having a major stroke is within the first few days after a mini-stroke			1
however , for many people it does n’t feel like an emergency because the symptoms are brief			2
‘ too many mini-stroke patients delay calling 999 when their symptoms start and instead book a @entity46 appointment or visit their optician because of their visual symptoms			1
’ the charity ’s report found that one in three people who had a mini-stroke in the past five years thought it was just a ‘ funny turn ’			1
only one in five rang 999 and almost half said the symptoms did not feel like an emergency			1
but one in five then went on to have a stroke			2
what to watch for the charity questioned 670 people for the report , which was supported by @entity62			0
and a quarter of those surveyed said healthcare professionals had not recognised the symptoms as those of a @entity10			0
more than a fifth said they were not given any information about lifestyle changes they needed to make to prevent a stroke			1
strokes can affect even the seemingly fit and healthy , as father of four @entity76 , 53 , discovered			0
he had a @entity10 one evening in october 2011			0
he said : ‘ i was clearing the dishes away after dinner with my wife , @entity79 , when i felt a sudden numbness in my left arm and could n’t get my words out			0
i had to sit down			0
but it was over within about 30 seconds			0
’ mr @entity76 was taken to hospital , where a specialist confirmed he had had a mini-stroke			0
it was a huge shock , given his age and healthy lifestyle			0
‘ i had lost weight , my diet was good and i was in training for a 100km cycle ride , ’ he said			0
the mini-stroke was caused by atrial fibrillation , a condition which affects heart rhythm and increases risk of blood clots , which in turn raises risk of stroke and @entity10			1
mr @entity76 was put on medication to manage the condition and prevent a stroke			1
‘ i dread to think what could have happened if i had ignored it and just put it down to a “ funny turn ”			0

better awareness of symptoms could prevent 10,000 stroke a year
increased *surveillance* could save the @entity32 £ 200 million a year
only one in five patients suffering a mini-stroke thought to call 999
