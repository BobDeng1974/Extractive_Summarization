sir @entity1 , who won the @entity12 for economics in 2010 , was once a passionate believer in the benefits of the single currency			1

single currency : professor @entity94 will say that unless there is a dramatic change of policy the euro should be broken up ( file picture ) ' the policies pursued now to steady the euro are costing @entity21 jobs and they are creating a lost generation of educated young people			1
