by @entity1 reporter published : 13:05 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 15:12 est , 10 january 2013 the @entity3 college professor who is promoting conspiracy theories about the @entity6 shooting refuses to stand down from his outrageous statements			1
' i think that the entire country mourned about @entity6 and yet , once again , the investigation that journalistic institutions should have actually carried out never took place as far as i 'm concerned , ' @entity8 told a local television reporter on wednesday			1
the 47 - year - old professor bases his outrageous allegations largely on the flurry of conflicting media reports that were made as news of the shooting was released throughout the tragic day			1
now he adds that the confusion and so - called acceptance of the main stream version of events is telling of a larger problem			0
' well , i think that we need to as a society look at things more carefully			0
perhaps we as a society have been conditioned to be duped , ' he told @entity49 's @entity48 12			0
this interview comes just one day after a @entity52 official called for the professor to be fired his incendiary statements			2
@entity55 , the town selectwoman who has been helping @entity52 deal with the logistics of the aftermath from the shooting , slammed @entity24 professor @entity8 after he made outrageous claims about the december 14 massacre			1
placing blame : @entity8 says that the national media has not done enough to unearth the ' truth ' outrages : @entity55 ( center ) , the town selectman for @entity52 , says that professor @entity8 should be fired for his outlandish and insensitive claims ' shame on you , @entity24 , to even have someone like this on your payroll , ' she said of the tenured communications professor			1
' it is outrageous and an insult to all caring people to think that this man would chose this event as a stage for his outlandish conspiracy theories , ' she told @entity80			0
outrageous : @entity8 claims that the timeline of the @entity6 tragedy shows that there was a coordinated effort to hide the ' real ' story ' professor @entity8 is an embarrassment to me as an educator and should be to you as well , ' ms @entity55 said			1
' i can assure you , sadly , that the events here in @entity52 unfolded exactly as are being reported , with the horrible outcome of the violent death of 26 innocent people , including 20 children			0
' mr @entity8 , however , appears to think that what he was saying was in keeping with his role as an educator and asking both his students and the general public at large to review the events critically			1
' i describe myself as a scholar and public intellectual interested in going more deeply into controversial public events			0
although some may see ( my theories ) as beyond the pale , i am doing what we should be doing as academics , ' he told the @entity110			0
as with many conspiracy theorists who find darker linings in even the most horrific tragedies , this is far from his first foray into the world of the unproven			0
mr @entity8 has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars , economic overhauls and union negotiations			1
on his blog , however , he has hit a number of the classic conspiracy theories : the september 11 attacks , the purview of the @entity126 , the @entity127 , the death of @entity129 and @entity130 have all been topics of interest			0
shut down : @entity6 is now closed , seen here on january 3 , but a professor in @entity3 argues that the shooting that took place in the school may not have happened as is conventionally believed tragic : one of the points of professor @entity8 's argument is the fact that there have been no photos of the bodies of the 20 child victims or the six teachers even though he is paid to teach a class called @entity152 which will undoubtedly produce outrageous ideas , @entity24 appears to feel that the questioning of the murder of first graders was a bridge too far			1
' @entity8 does not speak for the university			2
the website on which his post appeared is not affiliated with @entity24 in any way			2
as for any previous disciplinary actions at @entity24 , we do not comment on personnel matters , ' school spokesman @entity162 said to the @entity110			1
though his ultimate end goal is unclear , he says that the end goal of the ' supposed ' shooting was political in nature			2
political ends : he argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns predictably , his statements have sparked outrage from people across the country and not just in the still - grieving @entity180 town where much of the last three weeks has been spent picking up the pieces			2
' is there something in the water in @entity3 that makes for idiocy , ' commented @entity186 on the story by the local @entity189 affiliate @entity188			0
' how dare you suggest this was a hoax and entertain that this did n't happen , ' said a @entity110 reader with the username @entity196			0
' i 'm afraid that you do not seem to be worthy of the teaching credentials that you hold and were any of my kids students of yours , i 'd withdraw them from your roster within the @entity203 are not good at what you do and you suck as a human being			0
' the moment he heard : mr @entity8 believes that there were government forces at work in the shooting at @entity6 , and theoretically then this may not be the moment president @entity212 was told instead , he is speaking plenty for himself and other believers by posting repeatedly on his blog , @entity216 , and appearing on talk radio shows to promote the theory			1
' as documents relating to the @entity6 shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent researchers , there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public consumption to further larger political ends , ' he wrote			2
he argues that senator @entity229 was already in the midst of trying to rework the assault weapons ban that she co-sponsored back in the 1990s , and that the shooting gave her leverage to move it through the legislative process quicker			0
it is unclear if mr @entity8 has any vested interest in the gun control debate or if he himself owns any guns			2
calls to mr @entity8 were not immediately returned .			1
