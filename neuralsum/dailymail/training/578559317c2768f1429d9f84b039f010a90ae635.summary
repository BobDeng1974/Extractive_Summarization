in space , no one can hear you snore - but that 's probably because you 're not asleep			1
most astronauts suffer serious levels of sleep deprivation that could be putting their lives in danger , a study has revealed			2
the reasons for this are poorly understood , but the sun rising and setting every 90 minutes when orbiting @entity13 on the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) is thought to be one possible cause			2
this , scientists believe , could be one of the reasons for the disturbed sleep patterns observed in the @entity28 study scientists studied the sleep patterns of 64 astronauts on 80 space shuttle missions and 21 @entity14 ( @entity14 ) crew members before , during and after spaceflight			1
a functioning man - made leaf ( pictured , right ) that absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen , just like natural leaves , has been created by an art graduate			0
the new material could provide a steady source of oxygen for humans on long missions in space and even help us colonise new planets			2
designer @entity49 claims that the leaves they could be dumped on planets that humans will colonise , as ' real ' plants can not grow in zero gravity			0
the material is made up of chloroplasts from plant cells that are suspended in a web of silk protein			0
the protein is extracted from natural silk fibres			0
they found that on average astronauts get less than six hours sleep a night on orbiting space shuttles and just over six hours on @entity14 missions			1
this was despite the @entity66 space agency @entity65 scheduling 8.5 hours of sleep per night for space - travelling astronauts			1
around three - quarters of astronauts also resorted to sleeping pills during spaceflight , raising concerns about the effect the drugs may be having on their performance			1
dr @entity76 , from @entity77 in @entity78 who led the study reported in the journal @entity82 , said : ' sleep deficiency is pervasive among crew members			0
' it ’s clear that more effective measures are needed to promote adequate sleep in crew members , both during training and spaceflight , as sleep deficiency has been associated with performance decrements in numerous laboratory and field - based studies			1
' she added : ' the ability for a crew member to optimally perform if awakened from sleep by an emergency alarm may be jeopardised by the use of sleep - promoting pharmaceuticals			2
routine use of such medications by crew members operating spacecraft is of particular concern			0
' @entity108 health guidelines warned patients taking sleeping pills not to engage in hazardous occupations requiring a high degree of mental alertness and co-ordination , dr @entity76 pointed out			1
scientists also believe that microgravity ( water under microgravity conditions , with astronaut @entity118 in the background , pictured ) could be causing @entity14 inhabitants to lose valuable sleep and resort to sleeping pills ' this consideration is especially important because all crew members on a given mission may be under the influence of a sleep - promoting medication at the same time , ' she said			1
' in fact , on the four shuttle missions on which all crew members participated , all crew members reported taking sleep - medications on the same night 6 per cent of the time			1
' with the sun rising and setting every 90 minutes , @entity13 orbit is known to be non-conducive to sleep			0
the @entity138 astronauts complained that their sleep was interrupted by light , noise and the cooling systems in space suits			2
but sleep disturbance continues to affect astronauts despite the quiet and dark ' sleep stations ' installed on the @entity14 , leading some scientists to speculate that microgravity itself may be to blame			1
however the research showed that sleep deficiency began to build up in astronauts long before a mission launch			2
on average , crew members enjoyed less than 6.5 hours sleep a night during training some three months before taking off into space - about half an hour less than the average @entity66 adult			1
after missions ended however , at least half of the astronauts found they gained a great deal more sleep			1
just 12 per cent of sleep sessions on the space shuttle and 24 per cent on the @entity14 lasted seven hours or more , compared with 42 per cent and 50 per cent after the same crew members had finished their missions			1
@entity167 - based scientist @entity166 has revealed all you could ever want to know about microgravity toilets in his latest video			0
@entity166 explains that astronauts perform numbers one and two using a suction system , and some of the waste is reused on the @entity14 for life - essential systems			1
on @entity13 , we are used to toilet seats about 12 to 28 inches ( 30 to 45cm ) in diameter , but in space astronauts must contend with an opening that ’s about four inches ( ten centimetres ) wide when they do a ' number two '			2
they use restraints to hold themselves to the seat , which ensures that no waste can escape while they sit down and do their business			0
to train astronauts to do this , @entity65 has a toilet with a camera inside so they can practice positioning themselves correctly when they sit down			2
‘ the toilet itself works like a vacuum cleaner , using differential air pressure to suck the solid waste away , ’ continues @entity166 in the video			0
the waste is not jettisoned into space , however , and is instead stored on the station to be disposed of on a capsule returning to @entity13			0
astronauts ’ sleep patterns were studied using an actigraph , a device worn on the wrist which records sleep and wake cycles			0
researchers also looked at diary entries from astronauts recording alertness and sleep quality			0
co-author dr @entity216 , also from @entity77 , said : ' future exploration spaceflight missions to the moon , @entity219 , or beyond will require more effective countermeasures to optimise human performance by promoting sleep during spaceflight			1
' these may include modifications to schedules , strategically timed exposure to specific wavelengths of light , and behavioural strategies to ensure adequate sleep , which is essential for maintaining health , performance and safety			0
' commenting on the findings in the journal , dr @entity237 from the @entity238 , @entity66 , stressed the need for more research on the effects of space travel on sleep			1
' only four people have consecutively lived and worked for more than one year in space , ' he said			0
' as such , how sleep and behavioural health will be affected during space exploration is poorly understood			0
' studies of the physiology of sleep stages and the intensity of sleep			0
. in space are necessary to answer the important question of whether spaceflight reduces the need for sleep and therefore the ability to sleep , or whether it reduces the ability to sleep but not the need for sleep			2
