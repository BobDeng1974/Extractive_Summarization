airline rivals @entity0 and @entity1 have locked horns once again on @entity3			1
in not - so - subtle posts on the social networking site , the two carriers reignited their feud by posting tweets concerning their operation at @entity10			0
@entity0 , run by @entity11 , shared a photo of two of its staff by an advertising banner in @entity16 , along with the words : ' @entity18 have come to @ @entity19 at last			1
' fly from @entity20 for the lowest fares made simple			0
' @entity0 took to @entity3 for a cheeky promotional photo in terminal 2 in @entity10 - where @entity1 fly out from in response to @entity0 's post , @entity1 had a dig at where @entity0 fly their passengers out too @entity0 flies out of @entity28 at @entity10 , whereas @entity1 flies from @entity16 , so it was clear the tweet was a joke at its rival 's expense			1
however , without directly responding to the sly dig , @entity1 responded in fine form			0
@entity37 's national airline tweeted : ' fly from @entity19 at @ @entity19 to central locations across @entity39			1
@entity20 gets you nearly there , we get you really there			0
' the words appear to be a reaction to terminal 1 - based @entity0 often using smaller and former military bases throughout @entity39 , often away from the central point of the destination city			1
@entity0 have been accused by rivals @entity1 of getting their customers ' nearly ' to central locations this is n't the first time the two have taken to @entity3 to engage in some light - hearted banter			1
back in january a row erupted when @entity1 tweeted photos and claimed one of its planes was featured in the background of an online advert for @entity0 ’s ‘ business plus ’ service			2
with a smiley face emoticon for good measure , @entity1 gleefully wrote to its 89,000 followers : ‘ @entity66 by @entity67 on @entity0 ’s website ! even they know we ’re @entity70 ’			2
@entity1 took to @entity3 to point out that @entity0 had used an @entity1 plane on some of its promotional material @entity1 ’ attempt to publicly embarrass @entity0 did n’t sit well with its low - cost rival			1
@entity0 responded with an affront of its own : ‘ even @ @entity1 is talking about @ @entity76			2
fyi , he ’s smiling cos he saved a fortune & avoided another late @ @entity1 arrival ! ’ as their @entity3 followers weighed in and encouraged more banter , the @entity10 - based airlines traded a few more tweets before calling it quits			0
@entity0 , in typical fashion , responded to @entity1 ' post as only they would the @entity88 @entity87 is set to rule @entity0 ’s 29.82 per cent stake in @entity1			1
@entity0 is the largest individual shareholder and it is set to find out if it will be forced to comply with competition regulators and sell down to no more than five per cent			0
@entity0 has predicted @entity92 - owner @entity93 will return with another tilt at @entity1 as soon as this week			2
the budget airline said it is ‘ actively ’ seeking a buyer for its stake in @entity1 , which it has to sell due to competition requirements , and expects @entity93 to make a third offer to the group imminently			0
@entity1 and @entity0 have often taken to social networking for subtle digs at each other			0

@entity0 post promo photo in @entity16 - where @entity1 fly out from
they tweet that ' low fares have come to @entity108 at last '
the low - cost airline are actually based out of @entity28
@entity1 respond saying they get customers to central locations , not ' nearly there '
