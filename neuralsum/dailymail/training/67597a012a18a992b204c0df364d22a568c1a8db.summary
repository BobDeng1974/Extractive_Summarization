a cargo of 20billion euros in cash has lain unclaimed at a @entity3 airport for six years amid allegations it could be the secret fortune of @entity6			1
the stash , now under high security in a cargo depot , is held on 200 wooden pallets each worth 100 million euros , enough to keep the entire @entity11 going for almost two months			1
@entity14 customs have demanded the real owner of the booty " presents himself " to claim the fortune , but while a number of bogus and unconvincing attempts have been made to obtain it , no - one has satisfied the authorities that they are the rightful recipient			1
under armed guard at @entity26 in @entity14 there is £ 16.75bn in cash stored on wooden pallets ' it is possible that this is the money of @entity6 , ' an anonymous intelligence source told @entity33 newspaper			1
the cash mountain , all in 100 euro notes , was flown to @entity26 in @entity3 from @entity36 on 7 august 2007 and it has remained frozen there ever since			1
@entity14 sources say the authorities have failed to untangle the identity of the ultimate owner of the money , which - strangely - arrived at the airport without a specified recipient on the consignment			1
why @entity6 's ill - gotten nest egg would have been sent from @entity48 to @entity14 four years after he was toppled , and eight months after his execution , is unclear , but this is not the only theory about the money 's origin			1
it is claimed that the @entity56 tyrant had shifted £ 7.5 billion to @entity3 in diplomatic bags before he was ousted , yet this was far short of the full wealth he had amassed			2
documents show @entity62 as the sender of the money but he has not come to claim the cash dead dictators : theories suggest the money could have actually belonged to either @entity6 ( left ) , former ruler of @entity56 , or @entity70 , who was shot following the @entity72 uprising ' there are other possibilities too , ' said a security source last night			1
@entity6 was not the only dictator who funnelled away a fortune : what about @entity70 ? ' another explanation is that this is @entity14 mafia money or the fortune of corrupt @entity14 officials but that has become too dangerous for anyone to claim			1
it is a gargantuan sum			0
' the waybill , while not naming a recipient , suggested the owner was 45 - year - old @entity88			1
his passport details show him to be @entity90 , but @entity14 customs and other agencies appear far from convinced that he is the ultimate owner			1
nor has he appeared in @entity3 to claim the loot			2
reports last night suggested that the cash was intended for an obscure foundation called @entity98 , yet its headquarters are @entity100 and the final destination of the cash was @entity14			0
it 's boss , called @entity104 , 53 , is one of a number of people who have failed to convince the authorities to hand him cash that would make him wealthier than @entity111 , who is worth £ 9 billion			1
his charitable organisation is reported to have offered a two billion euro fee to lawyers to win the case , but @entity3 's legal experts show no desire to take it on			2
@entity118 , a customs affairs expert , said : ' the shipper did n't specify a recipient			0
it suggests that something is wrong with the cash			0
' surely someone would have claimed the cargo from the very beginning			0
it remains unknown who exactly did so			0
' probably , there was a certain plan how this cash was supposed to cross the @entity14 border since no - one with any sense would send such money to " nowhere "			2
' something must have gone wrong , and " mr @entity138 " failed to receive the cargo			0
after a number of failed attempts to collect the cash , it was decided to act via a foundation			2
' this is a common money laundering practice			0
' whoever manages to convince @entity14 authorities the money is theirs will be worth more than @entity111 the @entity14 government has so far not seized the money			2
@entity118 added : ' it turns out that there are no reasonable grounds for seizing it			0
' the owner of the cash is named on paper			2
the cash is real and was transferred from a @entity48 bank			0
' the bank has been named as @entity158 , though this is not confirmed			0
' @entity160 demanded the owner of the cargo to appear in person , ' said @entity118			0
' the authorities had to make sure that the owner was alive and is not a fake			2
' @entity62 ( also known as @entity167 ) - who in 2010 was accused of being the " mastermind " of an attempt to steal $ 14billion from the @entity170 of @entity171 using false documents - has not appeared in @entity3 to stake his claim			1
he was reported to have avoided trial in the @entity175 by fleeing to @entity90			0
it is unclear if there is any link between the @entity171 and @entity3 cases , but in any event the @entity14 have rejected his attempts to use intermediaries to claim the cash			1
one source familiar with the situation said that a dozen groups have sought to claim the cash , all claiming to have @entity62 's authority			0
' they include criminals , @entity192 groups , and @entity100 gangsters , ' said the source			0
the security source claimed that @entity62 was a likely ' front man who lost control of a fortune he was nursing on behalf of shady interests related to a wicked dictator , corrupt senior officials , or a huge mafia operation linked to a state			1
we may never know to whom it belongs			0
