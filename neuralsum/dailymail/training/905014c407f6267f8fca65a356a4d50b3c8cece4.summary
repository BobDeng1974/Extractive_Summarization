by @entity0 published : 16:18 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 20:21 est , 1 january 2014 the treason trial of former @entity4 president @entity3 was delayed again yesterday by an explosive device found near his home			1
police said officers scanning the route to court spotted the device two miles from the retired general 's farmhouse on the outskirts of @entity15			0
his lawyers said it was too dangerous for @entity3 to appear			1
this was the third time since the trial began that explosives have been found			1
facing charges : former @entity4 president @entity3 ( centre ) is escorted by soldiers it 's the most serious of the legal troubles the 70 - year - old @entity3 has faced since he returned to @entity4 in march			1
he came back hoping to run in elections but instead had been faced with a barrage of court cases connected to his rule and barred from being a candidate			0
the case has also brought some grumbling from within the military 's supporters , wary that one of their own is in court			0
for their part , @entity3 's lawyers have contended that the judiciary trying him and the government bringing the case are biased against the former general			1
the current prime minister , @entity46 , was the man deposed by @entity3 in the 1999 coup and the recently retired chief justice was also detained by @entity3 in 2007			1
the judge in wednesday 's hearing , @entity51 , was sympathetic to the defense 's security concerns and adjourned the hearing until thursday			0
but he pointed out the security arrangements and suggested he could issue an arrest warrant for @entity3 if he fails to appear thursday			0
police officer @entity57 said officials scanning the route to court spotted the device on wednesday along a road about two kilometers ( a mile ) from @entity3 's farmhouse on @entity15 's outskirts			2
one of @entity3 's lawyers , @entity65 , told the three - member panel of judges hearing the case that there were ' many security issues ' preventing the former leader 's appearance and that the court would be responsible if anything went wrong			1
former @entity4 president @entity3 after he resigned from office in 2008 @entity15 police officials said 1,000 security personnel were deployed to protect @entity3 but said they could not guarantee a bomb - proof vehicle for the former general to ride in			2
@entity3 's lawyers have also argued that the special court hearing his case was not properly formed , that the individual judges are biased and that the case against him is a vendetta by the prime minster and the recently retired chief justice			1
at one point during the sometimes testy proceedings , @entity65 pointed his finger at the prosecutor , @entity92 , and said : ' he 's not a prosecutor			0
he 's a persecutor ! ' @entity3 took power in a 1999 coup and ruled @entity4 for nearly a decade			0
but he 's not on trial for the coup			0
instead he 's accused of high treason in connection with the state of emergency he imposed in 2007 and the detention of judges			1
those actions sparked widespread demonstrations by lawyers around the country that eventually weakened the rule of the already unpopular @entity3 so much that he was forced to step down			2
@entity3 's legal ups and downs have riveted a country that has experienced three military coups and where top generals and army chiefs have traditionally been above the law			2
the scenes of @entity3 going into and out of court rooms - essentially being treated like a common citizen - has underlined how much prestige the power the @entity4 military has lost in recent years			1
the army has said nothing publicly about the @entity3 trial but many retired military officers - sometimes a barometer for opinion within the service - have stood up for @entity3			1
a group of retired military officers met tuesday in @entity15 in what was essentially a show of solidarity			0
@entity134 , a retired major in the @entity4 army , said @entity3 was a ' good general ' and that he was worried that the trial would not be ' free and fair			2
' the government pushed back wednesday against any suggestion that @entity3 may have the support of the military			0
information minister @entity142 said @entity3 is trying to use the army to cover up his crimes and that the army is a ' national institution ' that is devoted to serving their nation , not one individual			2
meanwhile , a suicide bomber rammed a bomb - laden vehicle into a bus carrying @entity154 pilgrims through the southwestern city of @entity156 , killing two people and wounding an additional 26 , said police chief @entity158			0
there was no claim of responsibility but @entity163 extremists who view members of the @entity154 minority sect as heretics have carried out multiple such attacks in @entity168 in the past .			0

former army chief @entity3 is facing high treason proceedings
his lawyers said it was too dangerous for the 70 - year - old to appear
it is third time that explosives have been found on his way to court
