by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 as @entity2 puts his body through another gruelling pre-season , three of his @entity6 team - mates are still to start their summer holidays			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 wo n't be able to put their feet up until sunday night following the @entity13			1
' i text them to congratulate them on how well they ’re doing and just hope that they can go on and win it , ' said @entity2			1
preparation : @entity2 takes part in @entity6 's first pre-season training session of the summer ' it must be an unbelievable feeling just to have the chance to play in a @entity13 final			1
' i ’m sure they ’re enjoying it and the way they are playing is a joy to watch			2
it must be really good to be a part of that			2
' we ’ll be very proud for them if they win it and it will be a big experience for them to win a tournament like that			2
' it gives you confidence and another dimension			2
hopefully they can do it and bring that spirit back with them to @entity6			1
' that will only strengthen our team and spirit and the ability to win which is the most important thing			1
' so i am supporting @entity56 , absolutely			1
i would be so happy for these three to win it			0
' indeed , having been pilloried an eight season trophy drought , winning is once again becoming a habit at the @entity61			2
first there was may 's dramatic @entity64 win over @entity65 - and now three @entity66 are on the brink of winning the biggest prize of all			1
all the way : @entity6 trio @entity8 ( left ) , @entity9 ( right ) and @entity10 have reached the @entity13 final with @entity56 ' when you are under pressure and in a difficult situations and end of up winning that trophy which is something we had n’t done for a long time , it creates a bit of momentum and belief , ' explained the @entity66 vice-captain			1
' hopefully this can be the platform for the future			0
the @entity64 is not enough			0
for me , i do n’t accept that			0
' for this club it is not enough and we need to go to bigger challenges now			2
' despite their excellent start , there was an air of inevitability when their title challenge faded during the closing stages of last season			0
big game : @entity2 revealed he has text his @entity104 team - mates to wish them good luck for the final those humiliating defeats to @entity109 and @entity110 merely underlined just how far the @entity66 were from reclaiming their crown as @entity113 's top club			1
but the imminent arrivals of @entity115 and @entity116 will go someway towards helping @entity6 build on their @entity64 success , and perhaps , finally mount a sustained title challenge			1
' all the top clubs will be strengthening and it is going to get even more difficult , ' said the @entity120			0
' only one is going to win it and then the other ones who have n’t been good enough are going to get criticised			0
staying ? the former @entity125 man has just 12 months left on his @entity6 contract ' if we start very well again , people will say : " @entity6 will tire by @entity129 "			1
i do n’t think that is going to change			0
' the only thing that will change that is if we get to that stage and go through it and win it			0
if we add in the right areas , together with the experience we have now , i think we have a great chance			0
' but whether @entity2 is at the club to play a role in their resurgence remains to be seen			1
the former @entity125 man has just 12 months left on his contract and has been offered no guarantees of an extension			0
he will hold talks with manager @entity148 once the @entity149 returns to the club 's @entity150 next week			2
and if the @entity120 has his way , then he 'll be at the @entity61 beyond his existing contract			0
new boy : @entity115 has completed his £ 30million move from @entity156 to @entity6 ' i can not give you an answer at the moment but yes , the manager and i will be in contact and we will decide			1
' i do n’t know when , sometime soon , we want what is best for everyone			0
i ’m really happy here and i ’ve always been happy and grateful to play for this club			2
' if i continue doing that i ’ll be more than happy			0
but if i feel i am not productive then there is no point me being here			0
gunner : @entity6 midfielder @entity2 ( right ) has reiterated his intention to extend his stay with the club ' at this club you are always going to challenge with big players and good players , and i ’ve been doing it for the last few years with players in my position and i have no problem with competing with players			1
' but if someone comes to me and says : " @entity2 , you ’re not going to play anymore , you ’re not important " , then with my personality i do n’t want to be somewhere they do n’t want me , there ’s no point in that			2
' but this is not the case			0
i absolutely expect to be here next season			0
