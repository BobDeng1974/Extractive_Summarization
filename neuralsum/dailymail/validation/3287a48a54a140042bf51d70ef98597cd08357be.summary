a short circuit has temporarily rendered @entity2 's @entity1 inactive as engineers investigate the problem			1
the @entity6 rover stopped work when an electrical problem was discovered while it was using its arm to move powder into its sample container			1
the severity of the problem is not yet known , but @entity2 said they expected to resume operations in several days if it can be resolved			1
a short circuit occurred in the rover 's arm as it was moving			1
@entity2 engineers in @entity19 are now investigating the problem			1
the rover ( shown here in a recent mosaic image taken by its arm ) had been transferring rock powder into a sample analysis container ' we are running tests on the vehicle in its present configuration before we move the arm or drive , ' said curiosity project manager @entity31 , of @entity2 's @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity19			1
' this gives us the best opportunity to determine where the short is			2
' the short circuit occurred while the rover was moving its arm on 27 february			1
when the rover detected the anomaly , it stopped the movement of its arm			2
@entity2 said that such a brief short could have little effect on rover operations , or it ' could prompt the rover team to restrict use of a mechanism '			1
quite how much lasting damage the short will have caused , if any , is not yet known			2
on @entity55 the official account for the rover , @ @entity54 , said : ' call me @entity57			2
some ops on hold while my team investigates a short circuit			1
' the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			1
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity6			2
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity6			0
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity69 at approximately 2,000lb ( 900kg )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity72			0
the fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover			1
this powder was taken from a rocket target called @entity82			0
curiosity has successfully analysed five samples from drilling targets before in 2013 and 2014 , but this is the first time this problem has arisen			0
on this particular occasion , @entity1 revealed the true colour of @entity6 was not red - but blue and grey			0
by drilling a few centimetres into the ground , the drill dug up material that had a different colouration to the surface			0
the fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover			1
this powder was taken from a rocket target called @entity82			0
the material appears blueish - grey , seen here , because it had not yet oxidised in the @entity6 air the reason is that @entity6 is mostly made of silicon and oxygen , and also contains significant quantities of iron , magnesium , aluminium , calcium and potassium			0
when the soil is exposed to the air it oxidises and ' rusts ' , giving it its red appearance			0
' we 're sort of seeing a new colouration for @entity6 here , and it 's an exciting one to us , ' @entity118 , sampling system scientist for curiosity at @entity2 's @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , said in a statement			2
this raw - color view from @entity1 's @entity126 shows the rover 's drill just after finishing a drilling operation at @entity82 on 24 february 2015			1
three days later , a fault - protection action by the rover halted a process of transferring sample powder that was collected during this drilling on @entity55 the official account for the rover , @ @entity54 , said : ' call me @entity57 [ pictured ]			1
some ops on hold while my team investigates a short circuit			1
' one of the reasons for the particularly different colour might be the large amounts of silicon that were dug up , as analysed by the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) on the rover			0
' when you graph the ratios of silica to magnesium and silica to aluminium , ' @entity82 ' is toward the end of the range we 've seen , ' said @entity1 co-investigator @entity156 , from the @entity157 in the @entity158			0
' it 's what you would expect if there has been some acidic leaching			0
we want to see what minerals are present where we found this chemistry			0
' curiosity is now continuing to climb @entity169 , at the centre of @entity72 , to look back into the geological history of @entity6 - and analyse soils at different altitudes			0
the rover had been transferring material to the @entity176 at @entity6 ( @entity178 ) instrument , seen here in a previous image taken by @entity1			2
it has successfully analysed four drill samples before , but has not yet experienced this short circuit failure			2

a short circuit occurred in the rover 's arm as it was moving
it had been transferring rock powder into a sample analysis container
however an electrical problem then caused the rover to stop operations
@entity2 engineers in @entity19 are now investigating the problem
if it can be solved the rover should begin operations again in a few days
