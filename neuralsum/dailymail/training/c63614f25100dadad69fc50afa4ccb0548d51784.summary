the traditional bedtime story is dying out as a new study shows a third of parents never read their young children a story at night			1
just 64 per cent of those with children under seven read to them at all			2
and of those , a mere one in five get a book out every night			0
the average child gets three bedtime stories a week , but five per cent do not own a single book ( picture posed by models ) the study shows the average modern day child gets three bedtime stories a week			1
but a quarter of a milllion children aged seven or under , or just under five per cent , do not own a single book			1
in contrast , 91 per cent of those parents said they were read regular stories as a child , according to the research by online family retailer @entity29			2
this has clearly had an impact as the vast majority of parents admit they see the importance of the bedtime ritual			2
unfortunately , it seems many struggle to get their children interested in books			0
@entity42 star @entity41 is helping launch a children 's bedtime story competition - pictured here with husband @entity47 and sons @entity49 and @entity50 two years ago the study found that nearly half of kids would much rather watch tv , play with toys or computer games			1
meanwhile , 13 per cent of parents blame a lack of time for not reading to them and 9 per cent claim they are ' too stressed '			1
yet three quarters of them were read to every night of the week as children			0
in light of the findings , @entity29 has teamed up with pop star @entity41 to launch a children 's bedtime story competition			1
children aged up to seven enter by creating their own tale as an illustrated storyboard showing their adventures with a magical friend			2
@entity42 star @entity41 , 31 , said : ' as a mum of three , i know just how enjoyable reading bedtime stories to my kids is			1
' @entity80 is only three , so he especially loves me putting on different silly voices when i 'm telling him stories before bed			0
' i 'm really excited to see all the different story ideas and ca n't wait to see what the kids come up with			0
choosing a winner 's not going to be easy			0
' in contrast , businessman @entity88 , 48 , admits he struggled to find time to read to his two children			0
mr @entity88 , of @entity92 , @entity93 , said : ' i tended to get back too late from work and the children were already in bed			0
' if they were lucky their mother had time to read them a story but it could be a real struggle to get them both fed and ready for bed in time			0
' @entity104 , @entity105 at @entity29 , said : ' we appreciate how important it is for parents and kids to spend quality time together , and bedtime stories are a great way to do just this			1
' the fact one in three parents feel they could and should spend more time reading with their kids felt like the perfect opportunity to launch this new campaign			1
' the more excited we can get children and parents about writing and drawing , hopefully the more they will want to read together at home			0
