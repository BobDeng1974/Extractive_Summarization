eastern @entity1 migrants are being offered expert help to fraudulently milk the benefits system by an accountants agency run by a @entity6 businessman , a @entity7 on sunday undercover investigation has revealed			1
our reporter , posing as a newly arrived @entity6 migrant seeking to claim benefits , was filmed being illegally offered bogus documents to support her application by an ‘ advice ’ agency in @entity16 yesterday			1
the news comes as work and benefit restrictions were relaxed by the government on @entity22 for migrants from the @entity25 ’s two poorest nations , @entity6 and @entity26			1
@entity27 , left , and @entity28 at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity16 speaking to our undercover reporter our investigator , @entity32 , a 25 - year - old @entity6 graduate living in @entity16 , told the company – @entity29 ( @entity34 ) in @entity30 – that she had been in this country for two months , working cash - in - hand as a cleaner without paying tax or @entity38 , but now wanted to see what benefits she could claim			1
two women employees , @entity41 and @entity28 , spoke to her for around 45 minutes and much of their advice was legal and correct			0
but they also told her they could draw up bogus paperwork , falsely stating she had cleaned both their houses to back up a housing benefit claim			2
@entity47 , wedged between a shop with a hand - painted sign reading ‘ houses cleared ’ and an accountancy firm , charges £ 20 for an hour - long consultation and its quarter - page advert in @entity16 - based @entity6 - language newspaper , @entity55 , claims that it can help with ‘ any type of benefits ’			1
the sole director of the company , which was registered in october last year , is 37 - year - old @entity6 @entity61			1
he also runs a firm called @entity63 , which changed its name from @entity65 in june last year and lists its activities as ‘ freight transport by road ’			0
change : @entity26 migrants arriving at @entity70 on the first day since the lifting of travel restrictions when @entity7 contacted the company , a man who called himself @entity73 said he offered face - to - face consultations on benefits for £ 20 , plus additional charges for extra services			1
these include a £ 50 ‘ registration fee ’ , £ 20 for help applying for a national insurance number , £ 60 to register as self - employed , and £ 60 to prepare a tax return			0
@entity47 also claims to provide help and advice with bank accounts , opening a limited company , arranging car insurance , mots , and exchanging a @entity6 driving licence for a @entity93 version			1
there is no suggestion that any of these activities involve any improper activity			0
at yesterday ’s consultation , the first woman , @entity27 , advised @entity32 that if she wanted to claim housing benefit she would need a national insurance number			2
but , as a self - employed person , she would have to submit work records and references along with her application to prove her past income			0
@entity27 even suggested she and her colleague @entity28 would be prepared to lie in writing to benefits officers , stating that their own homes had been cleaned by our reporter			2
the true cost of our open borders : the mail on sunday story last week @entity27 explained that @entity32 would need ‘ contracts with clients , references from clients			0
if you do not have them , we can help you			0
‘ we can give you references and if they [ the authorities ] call , they will call us to confirm			0
’ when @entity32 asked whether the arrangement was legal , @entity27 assured her it was			0
to apply for housing benefit from a local authority , claimants must fill in a 40 - page form giving details of their income and outgoings , including rent			2
crucially , for self - employed people who have not been in business long , they must provide a ‘ summary of their trading records ’ plus copies of invoices and payments			0
when approached by @entity7 last night , mr @entity61 said : ‘ we did not offer to prepare bogus documents to support a housing benefit application			2
‘ we suggested that if she needed help with references to apply for national insurance number , she could clean our houses and we can confirm that she has done so			0
’ another firm in @entity30 , called @entity150 , also gives advice about benefits , tax and @entity38 , but its staff did not suggest anything improper or illegal			2
when @entity32 asked @entity6 - born director @entity156 , 48 , about claiming the @entity157 while working , he replied : ‘ i would n’t advise it because you will get caught			1
’ he charged £ 40 for an hour ’s consultation in which he explained how to claim housing benefit , register for @entity38 , and he also offered help filling out the forms at the same hourly rate			1
immigration pressure group @entity166 @entity93 has warned that a total of 250,000 migrants from the two countries are likely to travel to @entity93 in the next five years , increasing pressure on the @entity171 and schools			0
the government has banned @entity26 and @entity6 from claiming out - of - work benefits for the next three months , but @entity166 forecasts that in - work benefits such as housing benefit and tax credits for low - paid workers will lure many of @entity26 and @entity6 currently working in @entity179 and @entity180 , as @entity93 handouts are significantly more generous			1
@entity166 ’s figures claim that single migrants from @entity26 and @entity6 can earn five times more in the @entity93 than at home , a wage topped up by the @entity93 ’s generous tax credits system .			1
