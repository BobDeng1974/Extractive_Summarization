the watchdog which branded the first privately run @entity2 hospital as ' inadequate ' ignored a large survey showing patients were very happy with the care they received			1
a damning report by the @entity7 last week gave @entity8 in @entity9 the lowest ever score for standards of care			1
the report was particularly scathing of @entity8 's @entity14 unit , with inspectors saying that 16 out of the 17 patients they had spoken to were unhappy with their treatment			1
this found patients gave it an average score of 8.4 out of ten , rising to nine out of ten for the respect and dignity patients were treated with			1
the @entity7 report and financial pressures led to @entity33 , the firm running hospital , resigning its contract – to the dismay of patients and staff who fear it may now close , or lose vital departments			1
but an investigation by the @entity43 this weekend raised suspicions that the report had been ' stitched - up ' by senior @entity46 and union figures implacably opposed to privatisation			1
they included one of the @entity7 inspectors who is linked to the pressure group @entity52 , and another a former member of the doctors ' trade union			2
in addition , a paediatrician believed to have heavily influenced the report is the local @entity46 parliamentary candidate			2
the glowing patients ' survey was carried out by the @entity7 just eight months prior to the inspection as part of a national poll involving nearly 40,000 patients from 140 hospitals in @entity67			1
a damning report by the @entity7 last week gave @entity8 the lowest ever score for standards of care , but it ignored a larger survey showing patients were very happy with the level of care there are now growing calls for an independent inquiry into the @entity7 's inspection over suspicions that it was unfairly critical			1
they are being led by @entity84 mep @entity83 , who has written to health secretary @entity85 urging him to carry out a review into the watchdog 's behaviour			0
and since publishing our investigation on saturday , scores of patients have been in touch with the @entity43 , relating their own experiences of first - class care at the hospital			1
they include one who wrote on our website : ' my father had a knee replacement surgery at this hospital in november and the place is immaculate , his care could not have been better			0
honestly , i am stunned that the place is in trouble			0
' another said : ' had to go to @entity8 on a couple of occasions and i must say i found the hospital to be one of the best i have been to			2
' the hospital , just outside @entity20 , serves 160,000 patients			2
under @entity2 management , it had been run by the private healthcare firm @entity33 since 2012			2
one of its key principles was to give more power to doctors and nurses , rather than middle managers , because they know what patients need			0
healthcare assistants pictured working on the stroke ward at @entity8 in @entity20 in 2011 since @entity33 took over , the hospital 's waiting times for @entity14 and treatment have been among the best in the country and patient reviews have been excellent			1
the @entity7 's initial survey of 293 patients treated at @entity8 's @entity14 – undertaken by post between january and march last year – gave it an average score of 8.4 out of ten			1
this rose to 9.1 for being treated with privacy and 8.7 for whether doctors and nurses properly listened			0
yet when the @entity7 visited the hospital in september , they claimed patients did not feel ' supported ' or ' well - cared for '			2
inspectors said they received ' feedback cards ' from 17 patients of which 16 contained ' negative comments ' and 12 who said they had not been treated with respect			0
this led the @entity7 to conclude the @entity14 unit ' requires improvement ' , while the hospital as a whole was branded ' inadequate ' and given the lowest ever rating for patient care			1
mr @entity83 said : ' i 'm really astonished by this report and find it very suspicious			0
it does n't stand up			0
' the patient feedback has been fantastic , @entity33 have really turned it around			0
' a larger survey found that patients gave the hospital an average score of 8.4 out of ten , rising to nine out of ten for the respect and dignity patients were treated with by hospital staff ( pictured ) more than 3,000 people have ' liked ' a @entity171 page set up to show backing for nurses , doctors and other staff at @entity8			1
and last week dozens of passionate supporters held up ' we love @entity20 ' signs at a public meeting held to discuss the hospital 's future			2
meanwhile a group of more than 40 doctors have written an open letter to the @entity185 journal pointing out that @entity20 's very promising statistics do not tally with its ' inadequate ' rating			0
these include figures showing that 97 per cent of patients would recommend the hospital to friends and family – one of the best scores in the country			2
professor sir @entity197 , chief inspector of hospitals at the @entity7 , said : ' we stand fully behind our assessment that safety , caring and leadership at @entity8 were inadequate			1
there is no reason to question the integrity of any member of the inspection team			0
' our findings highlight the significant failings at @entity8			0
they are not a judgment on the role of the private sector in the @entity2 or on franchise arrangements			0
our priority is the care that patients receive			0
where hospitals are failing to promote good care , we will say so regardless of who owns and runs them			0

report gave @entity8 lowest ever score for care standards
but damning report ignored large survey showing patients were very happy
larger survey showed 300 patients gave it an average of 8.4 out of 10
@entity7 report led to @entity33 , the firm running hospital , resigning its contract
but investigation raised suspicions report was ' stitched up ' by senior @entity46 and union figures *strongly* opposed to privatisation
a *spokesman* for @entity33 , the private **company** which has been running services at @entity8 , *explained* in full his **company** *’*s reasons for terminating its involvement : *‘* since the contract was put out to *procurement* in 2009 , the playing field has *changed* . first , like most hospitals , over the past year we have seen *unprecedented* @entity14 *attendances* at times up to 30 **%** higher , year - on - year - and not enough care places for healthy patients who await @entity249 , at the same time , our funding has been cut by approximately 10.1 **%** this year . with these pressures on the system , to *maintain* the standards our patients *deserve* requires significant further investment , on top of the *£* 4.84 million and *considerable* *resources* @entity33 have invested in the hospital to @entity258 believe that solving the problems *facing* @entity20 can only be *achieved* through joined - up *reform* in @entity9 across hospitals , *gps* and *community* services . we fully support the vision of @entity275 ( @entity67 chief *executive* ) 5 - year *forward* view , but these *potentially* *exciting* *reform*s are too far into the @entity279 , we were one of the first hospitals to be inspected under the @entity7 's new process . we *understand* their report will be published soon , and fully expect it to be *unbalanced* and to *disagree* with many of its conclusions . we are not the only hospital to find their process *problematic* , and believe that *inconsistent* and *conflicting* regulatory *regimes* *compound* the *challenges* for acute hospitals in the *current* @entity295 *combination* of these *factors* means we have now *reluctantly* concluded that in its existing form , @entity33 's involvement in @entity8 is *unsustainable* . *’*
