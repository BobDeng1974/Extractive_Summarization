by @entity0 published : 13:01 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 13:06 est , 2 october 2013 struck off : @entity1 was banned from ever practising as a nurse in the @entity3 again after a baby died during a home circumcision a nurse who let a three - and - a - half week baby bleed to death after carrying out a circumcision using just scissors , forceps and olive oil has been banned from practising in the @entity3			1
@entity1 , 67 , performed the dangerous @entity14 treatment known as a ' clamp and cut ' on @entity17 for a fee of £ 100 at the baby 's home in @entity21 , @entity22			1
a @entity24 panel heard that @entity1 carried out the circumcision at around 5pm on april 16 2010 and that @entity17 was still bleeding at 7am the following morning			1
@entity1 had reassured the baby 's parents , whom she had been put in touch with by a mutual friend , that the bleeding was slowing			0
but @entity17 was eventually taken to the @entity31 later that morning where he died shortly after arrival			1
a post mortem later found he died from blood loss			1
sitting in @entity36 today , the panel ruled that @entity1 , who was found guilty of manslaughter at @entity38 on february 9 , should never work as a nurse in this country again			1
@entity24 panel chair , @entity41 , said : ‘ ms @entity1 ’s actions resulted in the death of a three and a half week old baby			2
‘ she has provided the panel with no evidence of insight or remediation and as such the panel can not be confident that there would not be a repetition of her actions			0
‘ the panel therefore decided that a @entity52 was the only sanction which was sufficient to protect the public			0
‘ the panel was further concerned at ms @entity1 ’s failures to obtain informed consent and to provide the parents with any written or verbal information regarding aftercare , either before or after the procedure			0
’ @entity1 had previously received a 21 - month jail term suspended for two years at @entity38 and quickly announced she would be retiring from nursing			0
the court heard the nurse had performed thousands of similar procedures with each one costing £ 100 as she operated from a mobile clinic			0
tragic : the three and a half week old baby was rushed to the @entity31 in @entity22 but died soon after arriving many of the parents whose babies @entity1 treated were unaware that the simple procedure is available on the @entity71			2
@entity1 , who did not attend her central @entity36 hearing , was struck off with immediate effect			2
most circumcisions in the @entity3 are done for religious reasons but currently no formal qualifications are required to perform the operation .			0

@entity79 was struck off at a @entity24 hearing
@entity17 died in april 2010 after a home circumcision
she had already been found guilty of manslaughter in february this year
