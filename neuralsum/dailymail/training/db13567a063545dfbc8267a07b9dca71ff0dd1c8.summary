they have now been transferred to police custody where they are all locked up together the move is another twist of the knife as dr @entity12 tries to get to @entity43 with her two children where she can live with her husband @entity47 , a @entity43 citizen , from @entity48 , @entity49			1
instead she is back in a cell with her son @entity19 , 21 , and daughter @entity22 , one month			1
mr @entity47 is also locked up with them at the @entity56 police station in @entity57 after being confronted at @entity58 by 40 agents of the feared @entity30 and @entity60			1
it is believed they were trying to travel to @entity63 and @entity64 media have claimed that the @entity43 vice consul was with the family at the airport			1
mr @entity47 told @entity69 : ' we are worried			2
that ; s why we want to get out of here as soon as possible			0
' dr @entity12 ’s lawyer @entity73 told @entity0 : ' the authorities do not have the right to hold her			0
they appear not to want to let her leave @entity5			0
they are restricting her movements			0
' her husband @entity19 and the children are with her in the same cell			1
any reports suggesting she has been released are wrong			2
we need to highlight her plight			0
’ a diplomatic row has now erupted and the @entity5 @entity90 has summoned the @entity43 and @entity5 ambassadors to explain themselves			2
dr @entity12 had been granted emergency travel documents by the government of @entity5 to travel there and then on to the @entity43			1
menacing : @entity1 , her husband and children were detained by 40 national security guards on tuesday			1

@entity43 senator @entity105 ( @entity106 ) launched a blistering attack on the government of @entity5 on the floor @entity110 today in which he said it had ‘ forcibly captured ’ dr @entity12			2
standing in front of a picture of dr @entity12 and her husband , he said : ‘ we need to speak even louder , we need to speak out for @entity1 because it is wrong , especially for this young mother , to be subject to torture and murder for being a @entity122			1
‘ that is unequivocally wrong and we need to speak in one voice			0
’ earlier in an interview with @entity127 , president of the @entity128 , a christian right think tank , @entity105 called on president @entity129 to do more			0
he said : ‘ we do n’t know what their status is , we do n’t know if the @entity5 government is going to reimpose the horrific sentence			0
it ’s a powerful reminder - every one of us cherishes our religious liberty and i bet you to say that virtually none of us have had their faith tested as @entity1 has had her faith tested			1
‘ it underscores the need for all of us to lift her up in prayer and it also underscores the need for @entity43 leadership			2
‘ what i have been begging for is for president @entity129 to stand up and lead ... the president needs to say to the government of @entity5 : ‘ @entity149 now ’ ’			0
@entity105 added : ‘ sharia law that would torture and murder a young mother for protesting her religious faith is barbaric , it is wrong and it should be condemned ’ dr @entity12 was released from the grim @entity154 on monday after nine months in custody during which time she was sentenced to death and 100 lashes for apostasy and adultery and gave birth to @entity22 in her call whilst shackled to the floor			1
a judge had ruled that she had broken strict @entity166 law by failing to renounce her @entity122 faith and become a @entity168			0
' barbaric ' : as well as the death sentence for apostasy ( the crime of abandoning your religion ) @entity12 was also sentenced to 100 lashes for what the court deemed her adultery for marrying a @entity122 on monday an appeal court overturned her conviction after an international outcry but on tuesday she and her family were detained again			1
what happens next is unclear - dr @entity12 has yet to be granted asylum by the @entity43 - but so long as she remains in @entity5 her life is in danger			1
a man claiming to be dr @entity12 ’s half brother went to the prison in @entity57 the night she was released and , upon discovering she had been freed , flew into a rage and vowed to kill her			0
according to @entity197 , @entity196 , said : ‘ the family is unconvinced by the court ’s decision			0
‘ we were not informed by the court that she was to be released ; this came as a surprise to us			0
the law has failed to uphold our rights			0
this is now an issue of honour			0
the @entity122 have tarnished our honour , and we will know how to avenge it			0

fight for life : mr @entity47 , an @entity43 citizen , has been fighting for his wife and children 's release but his lawyers believe the help he has received from the @entity43 embassy has been ' shameful ' the statement added that the document was only supposed to be used for somebody travelling to their homeland and as dr @entity12 would be using it to fly to @entity43 it was invalid			1
in an interview with @entity0 @entity250 , founder of religious freedom organization @entity251 , which has campaigned for dr @entity12 to be freed , has said that the @entity43 embassy in @entity5 should have foreseen these kind of problems			1
she said that the @entity256 had been aware of her plight since 2011 when she married her husband and that the handling of her case had been ‘ incredibly negligent ’			0
ms @entity250 said : ‘ the @entity43 government should have coordinated with the government of @entity5 to get them out of the country			2
‘ i think that @entity265 should be investigating what happened here			0
‘ the @entity43 says that it cares about human rights issues and this is something they should be caring about			2
it ’s a total failure , it ’s shameful			0
