as the new financial year began , @entity3 launched a campaign highlighting the impact of reforms , which includes a cut in the top rate of income tax , launching a poster with the tagline ' who wants to @entity22 a millionaire ? @entity24 '			1
@entity3 said that ' millions are paying more while millionaires pay less ' and claimed a one earner family with children will be £ 4,000 worse off on average in the next 12 months as a result of changes introduced since the coalition took power			1
reducing the 50p top rate of tax to 45p will save 13,000 people with an income of more than £ 1 million an average of £ 100,000 , it added			2
but mr @entity2 insisted ministers had fixed a ' gross unfairness ' in the system left by the previous government that allowed the rich to pay less tax than the poor			1
in a letter he told @entity46 supporters : ' of course , the new 45p upper tax rate - down from 50p - is also coming into effect			2
' but do n't let @entity3 pull the wool over people 's eyes			1
they may complain now , but of the 13 years they were in power , the 50p rate was in place for just 36 days			2
' in fact , for most of the time their top tax rate was 40p			2
but 40p - 5p less than now			2
' and under @entity3 a cleaner would pay a higher rate of tax on their wages than a hedge fund manager selling their shares - a gross unfairness we have fixed			1
' among a raft of changes that came in today is the largest rise in the personal allowance , which means that no one pays any tax until they earn more than £ 9,440			2
prime minister @entity77 took to @entity78 to highlight change			0
he wrote : ' from today 24 million people will be paying £ 600 less income tax than in 2010			0
' but shadow chancellor @entity82 said the personal allowance increase was effectively swept away by the coalition 's other benefit and tax reforms			1
attack : @entity3 's poster hitting out at the coalition financial reforms ' families with children are being hit hardest of all , ' he said			1
' for example , a one earner family with children will be a staggering £ 4,000 worse off on average this year because of tax and benefit changes since 2010			0
' and this is on top of the income squeeze we have seen over the last three years as a flatlining economy has seen prices rise faster than wages			0
' these figures show the full picture @entity77 and @entity109 do not want you to see			0
' they reveal that any gains ministers boast about from the rise in the personal allowance are swamped by higher vat , cuts to tax credits and child benefit			1
' people in work , people looking for work , stay at home mums and pensioners hit by the granny tax are all being squeezed like never before			0
millions are paying more while millionaires pay less			0
' criticism : shadow chancellor @entity82 is pictured unveiling @entity3 's poster campaign today unite union general secretary @entity128 said : ' millionaires will be raising a glass of champagne to @entity109 this weekend as he slashes the incomes of people struggling to get by to give handouts to the rich			1
' but ordinary people - taxpayers - will be furious that @entity109 has chosen to give away £ 1 billion to the super-rich while their fuel and food costs rise and wages are falling			0
' @entity142 general secretary @entity141 said : ' cutting taxes for the richest in our society is a huge slap in the face for the millions of hard - working families struggling to make ends meet			0
' this move , which will lead to the loss of vital revenues , comes at a time when low - income households are seeing a huge range of vital benefits and tax credits mercilessly cut back			0
' it says a lot about this government 's priorities that it is forever coming up with new ways to take money away from those at the bottom , whilst handing out tax breaks to those at the top			0
