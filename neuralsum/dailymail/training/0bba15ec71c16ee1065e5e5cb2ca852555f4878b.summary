by @entity0 convention has it that women worry most about their bodies			0
men , however , are just as concerned , suffering the same lack of confidence about their shape – be it a tomato , brick , snowman or nacho			1
hundreds were asked to give details of their figures , allowing researchers to identify seven types among @entity20 males			1
although the look is popular with women , only 5 per cent of men thought they lived up to this muscular ideal			2
the biggest group – 49 per cent – admitted being a ' pear ' like comedian @entity59 , carrying a little extra round their middle			0
the most coveted shape was a ' cucumber ' , the lean figure sported by former @entity65 cricket captain @entity26			0
although 46 per cent wanted this , only 15 per cent managed it			0
the ' brick ' or generally broad all over figure similar to pop star @entity24 applied to 9 per cent of the 1,500 men quizzed by menswear retailer @entity71			2
on the chubby side were the one in ten who confessed to being a ' tomato ' like television presenter @entity34			0
professor @entity75 , a body image expert at @entity77 , said that media portrayals of men ( left ) are making the average man ( right ) feel insecure about his looks fewer than 5 per cent were at the extremes of the ' snowman ' – with the rounded chest and belly of @entity86 – or the skinny physique of a ' string bean ' like cycling champion @entity28			1
few of the men surveyed were happy with their shape , with almost half admitting they needed to lose weight			2
in fact , almost three - quarters hated their body , proving that it is not just women who feel self - conscious about their looks			1
professor @entity75 , a psychologist at @entity77 , said modern men care much more about their appearance than previous generations			2
' we live in a world where appearance is very important for guys – in work , relationships and well - being , ' he added			2
' @entity109 live up to the models on magazine covers , but more are moisturising , tanning and even wearing make - up			2
when men look good , they feel good			1
' the survey found that men felt at their physical best aged 28			1
but , as they aged , they lost confidence and some even suffered depression about the way they looked			0
many felt pressure from magazines to look good but most admitted poor diets and lack of exercise stopped them having a better body			0
according to the poll , prince @entity127 , 28 , probably feels quite confident about his looks the age at which men feel most confident about their body peaks at 28 , according to the same study			1
around 40 per cent admit that at this age they have the perfect shape for their age			0
one in three men said they feel they can wear what they want at that age , while 41 per cent think they have the perfect weight for their size			1
professor @entity75 said : ' men are changing and so is masculinity			0
in our younger years , we are still struggling to find our identity and who we are			0
' but when we get into our late twenties and reach 28 we become more comfortable with our bodies and assured about ourselves			1
' at that age people are typically starting to get married , have children and establish themselves in their career			0
' they become more comfortable in their body and it is the perfect age where you can still get away with eating less sensibility			1
' when we get into our 30s our metabolism decreases and start to put on weight			0
the last opportunity where we can get away with eating more and still feel good about our body is around 28 .			1

@entity20 men in fact fall into a *diverse* range of body shapes
study also found that men feel most comfortable in their skin aged 28
but regardless of body type , men are struggling with their self - esteem
