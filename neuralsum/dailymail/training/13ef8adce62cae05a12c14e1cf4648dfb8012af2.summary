it ’s hardly the most auspicious time for @entity2 to be travelling to @entity3			1
@entity4 after all are the swashbuckling , free - scoring darlings of @entity7 at present , spearheaded by @entity8 , whose extraordinary start in @entity10 has already seen him score two hat - tricks and seven goals in four games			1
meanwhile , last weekend in the @entity14 , @entity2 lost 4 - 1 to @entity15 , with striker @entity16 admitting ‘ they could have scored ten			1
’ so things would have been bad enough in normal circumstances , given that manager @entity22 ’s job is in the balance , with former @entity25 manager @entity24 , the latest young , hipster @entity26 , poised to take over if a poor start to the season continues			2
@entity8 has started his @entity4 career in sensational style with seven goals in four matches @entity2 coach @entity22 is under pressure ahead of the @entity4 match after a poor start to the season @entity2 captain @entity37 , who will miss the @entity4 match through injury , furiously gestures at his defence as they slipped to a 4 - 1 defeat at the hands of @entity15 @entity2 players admitted that @entity44 could have scored 10 in the weekend match @entity2 find themselves third bottom of the @entity14 table after three rounds of matches worse , though , @entity50 , the @entity26 @entity51 winner and mainstay of the defence , ripped his groin in that match and misses wednesday night 's game , meaning @entity2 now have an entire back four out through injury and face the prospect of having to field a centre - half partnership with a combined age of 37 in @entity62 and @entity63			1
the latter , 18 , only made his debut at the weekend as a substitute			2
centre - halves @entity67 , @entity69 and full backs @entity70 and @entity72 are all out as well as @entity37 , meaning @entity22 is left to fight for his future against one of the most - fearsome attacks in @entity7 with a make - shift defence			2
even at near full strength @entity2 struggled against @entity4 last season , losing 3 - 0 home and away			1
they have never scored against @entity4 in four previous matches and have conceded eight goals			2
all of which suggests it could be something of a goal-fest for @entity4			0
and though circumstances may dictate that @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity8 could have an enjoyable evening ’s work given the rawness of their defensive opponents , there is a broader point to be made about @entity4 's direction of travel			1
young centre - half @entity62 ( right ) faces the toughest test of his career against @entity4 @entity62 will partner fellow teenager @entity63 in the centre of @entity2 's defence at @entity3 @entity2 get the feel of @entity3 as they train on the eve of the match there has been plenty of scepticism about the dichotomy between @entity109 ’s desire for sexy football and @entity112 's instinctive need to defend a result			1
at times the tension between the two competing philosophies has threatened to tear the club apart , as it did seven years ago this week			0
cast your minds back to a desperately uninspiring 1 - 1 draw with @entity120 in the @entity121 at @entity3 in september 2007			1
two days later @entity112 was sacked , @entity109 seemingly no longer content with results - focused football			0
@entity124 like this and he invariably bristles and points you to @entity128 record - breaking season of 121 goals under his stewardship in 2011 - 12			0
yet there is undoubtedly a safety - first instinct in @entity112 that is missing in his tactical adversaries such as @entity136 and the @entity138 school or among the next generation of innovators , such as @entity141			0
@entity112 appears to have found the perfect balance between attack and defence at @entity4 this season @entity109 will be very satisfied by the start @entity4 have made to the season @entity147 also opened his account for @entity4 in the 4 - 2 win over @entity150 at the weekend it was evident as recently as last year ’s @entity121 semi-finals against @entity153 , where caution in the first leg and a failure to react to @entity153 ’s aggressive attacking football in the second half of the second leg cost @entity4			1
yet in this line up , with @entity8 up front , a trio of playmakers behind him and with @entity163 and @entity164 – or @entity165 – holding in midfield there does seem to be formidable goal - scoring potential which for the first time in years is properly balanced in midfield			2
of course there is a grave danger in hailing teams on the basis of fine performances in the late summer			0
@entity179 ’s @entity4 looked good initially			0
the real test will come when they are not playing against a rookie defence and some truly world - class attacks test what might well be a shaky back four			0
certainly @entity184 and @entity150 found @entity4 easy enough to breach and even @entity186 and @entity187 had their chances			0
but for now @entity112 seems to have found the right formula and tonight surely there will be much to enjoy in @entity4 ’s football ?			0

@entity2 forced to field a *makeshift* defence in @entity121 tie with @entity4 at @entity3
injuries mean teenage pairing @entity62 , *19* , and @entity63 , 18 , will take on @entity4 's formidable *frontline*
@entity8 has been in *excellent* form , scoring seven in four matches
while @entity4 have made 100 per cent start , @entity2 are third bottom of the @entity14 after three round of *fixtures*
@entity2 boss @entity22 is facing the sack if results do *n't* *improve*
