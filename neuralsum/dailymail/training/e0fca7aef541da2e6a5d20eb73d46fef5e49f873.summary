in their hunt for alien life , astronomers have so far focused on looking for @entity4 - like planets around smaller , cooler suns			1
but these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star			1
now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars , and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day - night cycle similar to @entity4 – increasing the chance of finding alien life			1
a study by astrophysicists at the @entity24 suggests that exoplanets - planets outside our solar system - are more likely to have liquid water and be more habitable than we thought			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of an exoplanet around a red dwarf ' planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to @entity4 's than previously expected , ' said @entity38 , a postdoctoral fellow at the @entity39 ( @entity40 ) at the @entity24			2
' if we are correct , there is no permanent , cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet , ' he said			1
' whether this new understanding of exoplanets ' climate increases the ability of these planets to develop life remains an open question			0
' dr @entity38 and his team reached their conclusions isomg a three - dimensional climate model they developed to predict the effect of a given planet 's atmosphere on the speed of its rotation			2
though astronomers are still awaiting concrete evidence , theoretical arguments suggest that many exoplanets should be able to maintain an atmosphere as massive that of @entity4			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of a hypothetical planetary system ' @entity74 is a key factor affecting a planet 's spin , the impact of which can be of enough significance to overcome synchronous rotation and put a planet in a day - night cycle , ' said dr @entity38			1
in separate research today , astronomers said they believe there are two unknown planets waiting to be discovered well beyond @entity86			0
they claim these planets are changing the position of objects away from @entity90 , causing them to behave in strange ways			0
@entity94 objects these objects , known as @entity96 , describe minor worlds such as @entity86 that orbit the sun at a greater average distance than @entity90			0
the most accepted theory says that the orbits of these objects , which travel beyond @entity90 , should be distributed randomly			0
they should also fulfil a series of characteristics such as have an inclination of almost 0 ° and an or angle of perihelion – which is their closest point of the orbit to our sun - close to 0 ° or 180 °			2
yet what is observed in a dozen of these bodies is quite different : the average inclination of their orbit is around 20 ° and angle of perihelion – 31 °			0
' this excess of objects with unexpected orbital parameters makes us believe that some invisible forces are altering the distribution of the orbital elements of the @entity128 , ' said @entity129 , a scientist at the @entity130 and co-author of the study			0
though astronomers are still awaiting concrete evidence , theoretical arguments suggest that many exoplanets should be able to maintain an atmosphere as massive that of @entity4			1
in @entity4 's case - with its relatively thin atmosphere - most of the light from the sun reaches the surface of the planet , maximising the effect of heating throughout the atmosphere and producing a more moderate climate across the planet			1
by creating temperature differences at the surface , between day and night and between equator and poles , the solar heating drives winds that redistribute the mass of the atmosphere			2
the impact is so significant that it overcomes the effect of tidal friction exerted by a star on whatever satellite is orbiting it , much like @entity4 does on the moon			0
' the moon always shows us the same side , because the tides raised by @entity4 create a friction that alters its spin , ' said dr @entity38			2
' the moon is in synchronous rotation with @entity4 because the time it takes to spin once on its axis equals the time it takes for it to orbit around @entity4			2
' that is why there is a dark side of the moon			0
the tidal theory , however , neglects the effects of an atmosphere			0
' the researchers say that a large number of known terrestrial exoplanets should not be in a state of synchronous rotation , as initially believed			0
while their models show that they would have a day - night cycle making them much more similar to @entity4 , the duration of their days could last between a few weeks and few months .			1

astronomers believe exoplanets that could hold water rotate around their stars at such a speed that they exhibit a day - night cycle similar to @entity4
this contradicts the *popular* theory that many exoplanets are locked in a rotation which causes only one side of their surface face their sun
