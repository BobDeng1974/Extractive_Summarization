the upset of @entity2 ’s travelling support at their treatment by the @entity4 led to the chants during the victory in @entity7 concentrating on that controversy rather than the team ’s top performance			1
the hard core fans were furious at the @entity4 for switching their loyalty scheme to award two points , or ‘ caps ’ , for attending home matches and one for away games when previously it had been the reverse			1
it is claimed the switch could lead to the demand for @entity22 tickets being over-subscribed with more fans getting enough ‘ caps ’ to be considered for priority allocation			0
the disgruntled supporters sang : ‘ two points for @entity29 , you ’re having a laugh ’ , ‘ we only get one cap ’ and ‘ loyal support , treated like s * * * ’			0
unhappy : loyal @entity2 supporters expressed their discontent at the new ticketing policy followers : @entity2 players celebrate with the travelling supporters after the 2 - 0 win over @entity7 the unpopular strategy has been brought in by the @entity4 because filling @entity29 for @entity2 matches is the priority over the next two years			1
they claim a lot of fans who travel to @entity2 away games do not watch the team at home			2
the away following claim the first game since the revised credit system was introduced — the @entity29 friendly against @entity53 — attracting the lowest crowd for an @entity2 match since the stadium opened showed a botched policy			2
fans chief @entity58 said : ‘ there is no question the @entity4 ’s policy is alienating the loyal travelling support			1
after all the improvements in behaviour , being regarded as surplus to requirements has gone down like a lead balloon			0
’ the @entity4 say they are monitoring fans ’ disquiet but have no plans to make any changes			2
another serious concern over the @entity4 falling out with the fans is that it will lead to a churn from the official @entity2 supporters club — all of whom are police vetted when they apply for tickets — and bring about unregulated accessing of seats elsewhere			1
certainly no extra problems are needed in the build - up to the powderkeg friendly against @entity85 at @entity86 in november			0
however , the @entity2 and @entity88 fas said on tuesday that they are confident of their security arrangements at a venue used to dealing with high - profile occasions where there is a potential for trouble , such as @entity96 games			2
ramping up : the @entity2 and @entity88 fas will have similar security arrangements to @entity96 games the viewing public have yet to re-engage fully with @entity101 ’s team , despite the impressive performance in @entity103			2
the average of 5.6million viewers and a peak of 7.7m were less than @entity107 were expecting for @entity2 ’s toughest qualifying match on the road to @entity22			1
it does not augur well , ratings-wise , for the next game at home against @entity113 , who offer no proper competition			0
meanwhile , @entity107 ’s ranking seems to be such that commentator @entity117 was seated in @entity119 economy on the way back from @entity7 while pundit colleagues @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 were travelling business class			1
downgraded : @entity107 presenter @entity117 flew back from @entity7 in economy class @entity4 chairman @entity127 , who was famously spotted reading the aptly - named erotic thriller @entity128 in @entity130 while watching @entity2 training during the @entity132 , whiled away some time in @entity103 in similar cerebral fashion — at an arts and craft store checking out pencils and brushes			1
a youth football league with more than 10,000 players has returned its @entity140 in protest at a mandatory rule to award three points for a win across all age groups from under 10 upwards			0
the @entity147 and @entity148 pride themselves on child friendly principles and want to keep two points for a victory to stop teams running away with the league or being stranded at the bottom			0
the @entity4 have yet to respond			0
bookmaker giants @entity156 — who have helped revitalise the @entity158 — are not expected to renew their title sponsorship of the fifth classic after saturday ’s running , following the clash with @entity164 champions weekend			1
@entity156 will wait for post-race findings before reaching a decision			0
closing shop : @entity156 will not renew its sponsorship of the @entity158 @entity171 's bright start to the @entity172 — leading to @entity174 ’s promising @entity2 debut — has also meant selling @entity176 owner @entity175 remaining remarkably relaxed that there are no buyers on the horizon			1
bright start : @entity174 has been one of the major positives to come out of @entity171			0
