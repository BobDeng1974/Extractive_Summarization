the @entity1 's @entity0 : @entity3 courts are trying to ensure their mobsters ' sons do n't go down the same route by taking them from their families @entity8 fought its mafia mobsters by confiscating their wealth			2
now judges are taking away something more precious : their sons			0
@entity14 ' , a shy 18 - year - old scion of one of @entity3 's most notorious mob families , is a pioneer in a new strategy to fight the mafia by exiling crime clan sons from their homes and families			1
@entity14 is the first of about 20 sons sent into a kind of rehab away from the mob by juvenile courts in the southern region of @entity30 , home to the dangerous ' ndrangheta syndicate			1
by age 16 , @entity14 seemed destined to go the way of his father , a reputed boss gunned down in a turf war , and three elder brothers in prison on mafia - related convictions			1
their photos line the wall of the fortress - like @entity14 ' home in @entity30 , seen in an exclusive visit by @entity47 , in a testimony to the rule of blood in the powerful ' ndrangheta			1
but when @entity14 was charged with attempted theft and damage to a police car , judge @entity51 followed up his acquittal with a startling order : the ' ndrangheta family prince would be sent away to @entity58 until he turned 18			1
@entity51 had sent @entity14 's three brothers to prison and wanted to spare the last son a similar fate			1
he cited legal provisions that allowed courts to remove minors from families incapable of properly raising them			0
@entity14 's mother seethed , but there was nothing she could do			1
' if you do n't like it , we 'll take him away anyway , ' the judge told her			0
@entity14 was placed in a @entity58 facility for troubled youths where nobody cared that he was a @entity14 '			1
rules were rigid , including no going out at night			0
everyone made their own bed and sat down for meals at a communal table			2
i was counting the days , ' @entity14 said in interviews with the @entity47			1
the judge put @entity14 under the wing of a fledgling psychologist , @entity88			1
the psychologist had helped launch a courageous band of youths who encourage @entity58 business owners to stop paying ' protection ' money to the @entity95			0
it was an audacious pairing , because the @entity98 ' crime clan was itself alleged to be in the protection racket			0
this unlikely mentor helped @entity14 understand the terrible human toll of organized crime , taking him incognito to ceremonies for @entity95 victims			1
@entity3 @entity106 police officers stand in front of the entrance of a @entity30 court after a bomb explosion : a court sent @entity14 ' , an ' ndrangheta family prince , away to ' rehab ' in @entity58 until he turned 18 if the psychologist acted as a surrogate brother , a construction company owner practically became @entity14 's second father			1
@entity117 told @entity14 what happened when he refused to pay protection money : his car was torched , his daughter ostracised			1
@entity117 even gave away the family dog , because @entity95 threats made walks dangerous			1
slowly @entity14 began to change			1
twice a week , he helped out at an after - school center for children from broken homes , even though doing something for nothing is an alien concept in the ' ndrangheta			2
he moved stiffly , always buttoned up , wearing a jacket even at outings at the sea			0
but he came willingly , a supervisor recalled			0
one day , he surprised everybody by clucking like a hen to make the children laugh			0
' @entity139 heartland : the beach near the town of @entity142 , @entity30 , were @entity14 ' is from @entity14 's exile was n't all hard work			2
on saturday nights , @entity145 took @entity14 out for pizza and beers , and even to discos			2
there , he earned respect because of his personality , not his name			0
just weeks before he was due to leave , @entity14 rebelled			2
his mother helped persuade him to stay			0
on his 18th birthday - february 8 , 2014 - @entity14 's exile ended			2
the after - school center treated him to a birthday cake with strawberries			0
soon afterward , he returned home to @entity142			0
in a letter to @entity161 in may , @entity14 made clear he was n't repudiating his family			1
but he wrote that he now wants a ' clean ' life			2
he recalled how one morning in exile , he went to the sea , from where he could see @entity30			0
' this time , however , i saw it from another perspective : i was seeing it from another place , ' he said			0
' but it was i who was different			0

@entity14 , scion of an ' ndrangheta family , was exiled for three years
carers made him come face to face with the victims of mafia crimes
since turning 18 , he has been freed and says he wants a ' clean ' life
