@entity1 was given the chance to flee when two other inmates hijacked the van he was being transported in , which had been left unattended outside a hospital in @entity12 , @entity13			1
unbelievably , instead of making a run for it , he dialed 911 and alerted the police about the escape			1
' @entity19 , you 're probably not going to believe this , but i 'm a prisoner in a van , and i 'm here with a couple of these other cats , ' he politely explained to the emergency operator			0
' a couple of the guys that were in the van jacked the van at the hospital			2
' the security vehicle was being driven by guards from the @entity33 when it stopped at the hospital on tuesday to drop off some ill inmates			1
the guards accompanied the sick prisoners into the building - leaving eight other inmates unsupervised in the vehicle			2
they also left keys in the van 's ignition so the prisoners could have air conditioning			1
inmates @entity43 and @entity45 took their chance to escape - kicking out a partition in the van , before moving up front and driving off			1
they travelled for about a mile before ditching the vehicle and fleeing on foot , according to police			0
however , @entity1 , one of six inmates left behind , was reluctant to escape			1
still shackled , he managed to climb out of the van and dial 911 with a mobile phone police believe he might have found in the vehicle			1
they were recaptured by police on tuesday evening @entity1 struggled to explain the van 's whereabouts to the operator - but volunteered to walk to a nearby road to flag down an officer			1
' we 're in @entity13 somewhere			2
i do n't know because we 're not on a road and i 'm not from here , ' he said			0
' i just do n't want to get shot by no cops or nothing			0
' the operator then asked @entity1 where the rest of the prisoners were			2
' we 're all in the van , ' said @entity1			1
' two of the dudes took off			0
the dudes that were doing whatever they were doing took off			0
' the prisoner remained on the phone until a police officer arrived on the scene			0
stolen : the inmates commandeered a van operated by @entity95 @entity1 , who was in custody on drug - related charges , was being taken to @entity98 when the van was hijacked , according to @entity12 assistant police chief @entity100			1

mr @entity100 said @entity1 's call had helped police narrow their search for @entity43 and @entity45 , who were recaptured and taken back into custody on tuesday evening			2
' it helped us locate them a lot quicker , ' said mr @entity100			0
' we did n't know what direction they were traveling in and his call helped us pinpoint their location			0
' all of the inmates were from jails in the western and northern @entity121 and were being transported to agencies in those parts of the country			0
