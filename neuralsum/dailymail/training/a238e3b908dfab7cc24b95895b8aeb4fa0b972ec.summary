@entity6 , 38 , has spent years claiming he and @entity8 billionaire @entity7 jointly founded @entity1 , which was later sold to @entity9 for an estimated $ 170 million			1
as a supposed high flyer in the tech world , his arrest over the fatal shooting of his ex-wife 's new husband on january 15 made national headlines			1
but it has now emerged that @entity6 never set foot in the @entity1 building , was not present for any of the seminal discussions , and repeatedly edited the company 's wikipedia page listing himself as a co-founder - even though marketing directors kept correcting his changes			1
his only connection to @entity1 , former executives told @entity28 , was that he went to school in @entity30 with @entity7 , who went to become the first president of @entity32			1
lies ? @entity6 ( left ) who is charged with murdering @entity38 ( right ) , new husband of his ex-wife @entity35 ( also pictured right ) , claimed to be a co-founder of @entity1 - which former executives say is false he also attended one of @entity7 's ' brainstorming ' sessions before @entity1 was created , but was not present at any of the brainstorming sessions which led to @entity1 's inception			1
in fact , a former friend of @entity6 told @entity28 , the self - professed co-founder left the tech business altogether to become a hairdresser during @entity1 's early years			1
@entity50 , former marketing director of @entity1 from 2006 to 2009 , told @entity28 he never saw @entity6			1
' @entity6 was a person that caused a fair bit of puzzlement for the company , ' @entity50 said			2
' he was publicly making the claim of being a co-founder			2
we were aware of this through @entity59 , which is a wonderful resource but comes with its own issues			0
' as the new head of marketing , soon after i joined i was curious to know who this person was			0
' socially , people told me no one knew why he made the claim			0
he was n't there when @entity7 , @entity72 [ @entity71 ] and @entity73 [ @entity74 ] came up with the idea and developed the idea			2
he was n't there when the company was finally formed			0
he never even set foot in the building			0
turned a blind eye ? @entity8 billionaire @entity7 has not commented on the controversy as former executives of @entity1 reveal @entity6 , @entity7 's school friend , pretended to be a co-founder of the network @entity1 : ( left to right ) engineer @entity87 , marketing executive @entity86 , marketing director @entity50 , and co-founders @entity88 and @entity90			1
@entity50 and @entity90 told @entity91 never worked at @entity1 ' according to his @entity92 , @entity6 worked at @entity1 for ten months between 2001 and 2002 , before the @entity94 version of @entity1 launched			1
there are no records of this and no one ever saw him there			0
' @entity50 said the company fought a constant battle , spanning years , trying to maintain the accuracy of their @entity59			2
' we went about correcting the false claim by editing it			2
but time and time again , a user by the name of @entity107 would go back in and change it inaccurately to say he was a co-founder			0
' that happened many times over multiple years			0
it became almost a joke			0
' eventually , after @entity1 was sold and many of us went on to our own start - ups or new firms , the importance of altering the wikipedia page to accurately reflect history was not a priority			1
' we almost forgot all about it until this tragic story came out			0
' speaking to @entity71 , a founder of @entity1 who was with the company through its sale to @entity9 , said that ' in my nine years working on @entity1 , [ @entity6 ] was n't involved in any capacity beyond some initial discussions with @entity7 [ @entity7 , another @entity1 founder ] before the company was incorporated '			1
@entity90 , who is no longer with @entity1 , said @entity6 ' never met or worked with any of our employees , investors , or partners			1

when @entity7 got serious about the idea , he enlisted the partnership of @entity90 and @entity88 - two @entity177 co-founders - to work with and left @entity178 behind			2
' over the years , while the @entity177 co-founders were always annoyed by it and they all played the game of editing @entity59 , it never seemed like @entity7 had a problem with @entity6 calling himself a co-founder - probably because he thought it was dumb and did n't care about it , ' the source said			1
