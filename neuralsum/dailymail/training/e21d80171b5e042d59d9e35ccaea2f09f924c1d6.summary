by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent ' currying favour ' : @entity3 mp accused the establishment of bribing the @entity5 the @entity7 establishment was accused of ‘ cynical bribery ’ last night after it emerged @entity5 have been showered with honours in advance of the independence referendum			1
the number of knighthoods , cbes , obes and @entity16 handed to @entity5 people has soared by 40 per cent over the past 18 months as the vote approaches			1
historically , @entity5 has been under - represented in the bi-annual awards , receiving fewer medals than would be expected for its population			1
but the dramatic increase has meant that in the last three sets of honours , @entity5 has been strikingly over-represented			1
@entity3 , an mp on the @entity26 public administration select committee , said the revelations further discredited the honours system by showing it was being used to ‘ curry favour ’ with the @entity5			1
any indication that the system is being skewed towards the @entity5 to sway the referendum result will cause deep unease in @entity36			2
the honours are handed out in the name of the @entity39 , who remains above the political fray			2
but the lists are drawn up by committees which include politicians and civil servants			0
@entity5 accounts for 8.6 per cent of the @entity7 population			2
if awards were distributed according to population size , the same percentage of honours would go north of the border			1
but an analysis by the @entity52 has found that in the @entity53 earlier this month , 10.1 per cent of awards went to @entity5 – much higher than would be expected , and a dramatic increase from the 7.2 per cent going to @entity5 18 months before in the @entity56			1
the @entity39 has been careful to remain neutral ahead of the independence vote on september 18 , and has reportedly refused requests by the ‘ @entity62 ’ campaign to speak in favour of the @entity61 , as she famously did in 1977			2
last night mr @entity3 said : ‘ the honours system is being used as it has always been used – to curry favours			1
‘ it could well be that , consciously or unconsciously , attempts have been made to curry favour with @entity5 , but i am sure @entity5 are capable of having their own honours system if they want it			1
the whole system is degraded – it is at best arbitrary and at worst corrupt			0
’ the number of honours north of the border has soared , including @entity75 ( pictured ) @entity76 , @entity77 mp for the @entity78 , said : ‘ this 40 per cent increase in honours will be seen by many fair - minded people as a cynical bribe by @entity84 politicians			1
’ among the @entity5 to receive awards in this month ’s @entity53 were @entity86 , chief executive of the @entity88 , and entrepreneur @entity89 who set up a jam business aged 14			2
@entity5 historian @entity91 received a knighthood , as did @entity93 , of trade body @entity94			0
around 1,200 honours are handed out twice a year – at @entity97 and on the @entity98			0
@entity76 : ' this 40 per cent increase will be seen by many people as a cynical bribe ' until 2013 , @entity5 was always under - represented – a fact acknowledged by the government in november 2012			1
it said : ‘ @entity105 and @entity106 have done better than their population size would suggest in recent lists , while @entity5 has been under - represented			1
’ at the @entity56 , @entity5 received 88 awards out of 1,223 – just 7.2 per cent			0
yet by the @entity53 in june 2013 , @entity5 received 114 awards out of 1,180			0
its rate had jumped to 9.6 per cent – well above what would be justified by its population share			0
by the @entity114 , @entity5 was taking home 10.2 per cent of the awards – 121 out of 1,192			0
this fell marginally to 10.1 per cent in this month ’s @entity53 – 116 out of 1,149			0
a @entity118 spokesman said : ‘ all nominations for honours are looked at individually and entirely on merit by independent committees			0
’ if @entity5 does vote for independence on september 18 , the @entity77 has promised that the honours system will be retained			1
@entity126 ’s party is keen to give the impression to voters that as little as possible will change if the country decides to secede			0
@entity39 will remain as @entity39 of @entity5 – and continue to award honours			2
but details about how this might operate are sketchy to say the least			0
at the moment , the devolved government in @entity5 can put people forward for awards			0
these are then considered by officials in @entity138			0
after independence , @entity138 would be taken out of the picture and honours would be an entirely @entity143 - based decision			0
so it is likely that , rather than announcing a @entity7 - wide list of honours as at the moment , @entity36 would announce two sets – one for @entity5 , and one for the rest of the @entity7			1
however , the @entity77 is still yet to work out exactly what would happen to honours for @entity5 people if the country opts for independence			2
the @entity5 government ’s official website of referendum questions and answers says that it will ‘ agree with the @entity157 any amendments to the honours system to reflect @entity5 ’s independence ’ .			2

number of top honours handed to @entity5 has soared 40 *%* in 18 months
historically @entity5 was under - represented - now it is over-represented
one mp , @entity3 , said it was being used to ' curry favour ' north of border
