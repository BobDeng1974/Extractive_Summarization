when it was announced the @entity3 leaders ' meeting would be coming to @entity4 , those living in @entity6 were assured the summit would be no interruption to their daily lives			1
however , video shot on tuesday showing a @entity13 aircraft whipping up an almighty dust cloud which engulfs a highway suggests otherwise			2
the footage shows a two tilt - rotor @entity18 aircraft practicing a landing near the busy @entity21 in @entity6 when it hits an unexpected spot of trouble			1
at first the dust cloud covered only a small amount of space around the aircraft itself , but less than 30 seconds later it has completely engulfed the surrounding area			0
@entity47 presenter @entity46 described the planes to the @entity49 as ' celebrities ' of the aircraft world and revealed they are not often spotted @entity52			0
however as the @entity18 started its descent it stirred up a huge red dust cloud the dust spread across the road and onto the busy @entity21 in @entity6 at one stage it engulfed the motorway making it near impossible for drivers to see ' we all know these aircraft purely through cinema , through news , they are like the celebrities of the aviation world , ' the keen plane spotter said			1
' @entity72 is probably the most recognised aircraft in the world , closely followed by @entity75 , which is what the @entity76 is called when it is carrying the president , ' ms @entity46 continued			0
it 's not the first air power that 's been spotted flexing its muscles at @entity82 at @entity83 leading up to the @entity3			0
all of the world leaders have brought aircraft to @entity4 with them , however the @entity13 planes are arguably the most impressive .			2

a @entity13 @entity18 aircraft was taking part in a drill ahead of the @entity3
it stirred up a huge dust storm which engulfed the busy @entity21 in @entity6
the six - lane motorway was completed covered in the bright red dust
the aircraft are in @entity4 ahead of @entity13 president @entity100 's arrival this weekend
