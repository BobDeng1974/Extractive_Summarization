by @entity0 a young couple whose pictures were placed on the @entity4 website after they fled abroad to hide their baby from social workers have promised never to return to @entity7			1
@entity8 and @entity9 have accused their local council of trying to remove their son , now nine months old , and put him up for adoption			1
the @entity7 - born couple flew to @entity16 last autumn and were the subject of an international alert when their names and photos were placed on the missing persons ’ section of the @entity4 website			1
on the run : @entity8 ( left ) and @entity9 have fled to @entity16 to hide their baby @entity25 from social workers in @entity28 but until a ruling made in the @entity31 of the @entity31 , they could not be identified because of the secrecy surrounding the family courts			1
at the hearing mr @entity8 , 29 , told the judge via videolink that they had bought a ‘ one - way ticket ’ to @entity16 , which has broken away from @entity16 and has no extradition treaty with @entity7 and does not recognise @entity7 law			1
the couple , who formerly lived in @entity28 , renew their 90 - day visitors ’ visas by going to the border with @entity16 and getting their papers stamped without leaving the safety of @entity16			2
they can carry on doing this indefinitely , they say			0
@entity53 social workers argue that their son @entity54 , known as @entity25 , must be returned to the @entity7 where he is still ‘ habitually resident ’ because of his parents ’ social and family links			1
the judge mr @entity57 said that the couple , who met two years ago , could be breaking the law by refusing to bring their child back			2
but over the videolink from @entity16 , mr @entity8 told him : ‘ good luck in trying to find us			2
i do not believe your court has jurisdiction over us			0
we are never coming back to @entity68			0
’ financial adviser mr @entity8 and travel agent @entity69 , 19 , fled after a relative made an allegation to @entity53 social services that mr @entity8 had a violent past			1
search : the picture of @entity25 and his mother used on the @entity4 website it is a claim the couple vigorously deny , but social workers warned them to split up so @entity25 could live with miss @entity9 in safety or else they would seize the baby			1
last friday the family ’s story was recounted during an extraordinary hearing in @entity87 when the couple backed an application by the @entity90 to lift reporting restrictions on the case			0
mr @entity57 said it would be ‘ absurd ’ to impose a reporting ban because the family ’s details were already on the @entity4 website			1
the judge emphasised at the beginning of the hearing that it was not being heard in secret			0
waiving the couple and baby ’s anonymity in a ground - breaking ruling , he said again later : ‘ i have explained repeatedly this is not a secret court			2
’ it was an important decision because the @entity90 has vigorously campaigned against family court cases being held behind closed doors			0
often , strict reporting restrictions are imposed against the wishes of parents or family members who appear there			0
last night @entity115 mp @entity114 , who has demanded more openness in the family courts , said : ‘ many , many families are escaping abroad to avoid having their children taken by social services which like a veil of secrecy in these courts because it hides any wrong decisions , of which there are many , by them			0
’ speaking from @entity16 yesterday , miss @entity9 said : ‘ the social workers said that if i stayed with @entity8 they would take our newborn son into care and get him adopted in less than four months			1
‘ i was scared they would take @entity25 so we decided to make the move to @entity16			2
‘ a few days later the social services found out we had gone			0
they went to the family court and were granted orders to recover @entity25 , and make him a ward of court without our knowledge			2
it meant the state officially became his “ parents ” and we were being treated like our own baby ’s abductors			0
‘ we were horrified when we found out our son ’s picture was plastered all over the @entity4 website alongside criminals , terrorists and murderers who are on the run			1
‘ we have been forced to live like fugitives , but we can not let them take our son			0
’ the family have rented a flat in @entity16 , where miss @entity9 lived for two years as a child			2
she added : ‘ we want to settle here so @entity25 is safe with us for ever			0
why would we return to a country that wants to take your baby and give him to strangers ? ’ in court the barrister for @entity28 social services said they still want @entity25 brought back to @entity7			1
another hearing is scheduled in a month ’s time .			0
