@entity0 has spoken out following widespread criticism over the recently revealed concert rider that appears to show the guitarist 's extreme dislike for bananas and love of guacamole			1
the former @entity10 front man 's contends that not only was that guacamole recipe on the list of demands not his own , but someone in his band ca n't have bananas around due to an allergy			1
an exasperated @entity0 took to his website to clear up the matter once and for all with a letter he posted sunday explaining the very particular demands			1
no diva : @entity0 's ( above ) backstage demands for a performance at the @entity24 were published by the student newspaper but on sunday the musician tried to explain the controversy away as for the bananas ban : ' did it occur to anyone someone on the tour might have an allergy to them ? ' asks @entity0 ' first off , this is none of your business , but i have no specific demands in my dressing room			1
i know i could ask for lots of things but i actually do n't ask for anything , ' he writes			0
@entity0 says the guacamole recipe is an ' inside joke ' between his tour manager and the local promoters to see ' who can make it the best			2
' he says the recipe could never be his because he ' ca n’t even make kool aid let alone cook any real food			0
' as for the banana ban , ' did it occur to anyone someone on the tour might have an allergy to them ? ' demands @entity0			1
' i know it ’s a fun thing for people to try to turn me into a jerk and a diva , but in this case it ’s pretty ridiculous , ' he writes			0
the ' drama , ' as @entity0 calls it , began when the much admired @entity69 musician made an appearance at @entity24 this week and , after getting their hands on his contract for the evening , the student newspaper decided to let the world know all of @entity0 's backstage demands			1
it turns out however , that @entity0 may be one of the easiest stars ever when it comes to demands , asking for little and even skipping out on alcohol all together , but stressing one thing above all - that his homemade guacamole recipe is made just how he likes it			1
that and that there be no bananas anywhere in the building			2
the artist ( seen above at the @entity89 performance ) asked for very little , and no alcohol , but did demand his guacamole be made just how he likes it and wrote out the recipe @entity0 's amazing guacamole recipe from his rider the @entity95 seemed less interested in then guacamole than in @entity0 was being paid that evening though , writing ; ' @entity0 in the contract is guaranteed $ 80,000 versus the right to receive 90 percent of the amount earned from ticket sales , which have a net potential of a little over $ 147,000			1
' they did however attach the contract , which breaks down how @entity0 's guacamole is made			1
it starts with 8 ' large , ripe @entity106 avocados ' which are cut in chunks and combined with four ' vine - ripened tomatoes ' diced , half of a chopped yellow onion , a bunch of chopped cilantro , four @entity116 peppers that are both ' de-veined and chopped ' and some salt and pepper to taste			0
this then gets gently mixed , so as not to mush up the avocados , and then covered with the avocado pits and the juice of half of a lime so the mixture does not brown			0
@entity0 suggests that it be made early , but not too early , and tossed in the refrigerator			2
the rider also states this is a ' no banana tour , ' and then adds ; ' we do n't want to see bananas anywhere in the building			2
' speaking of @entity0 , he was none too happy to have his rider go public , and a member of his team let it be known in a letter on his website			0
it said : ' the most important function of a rider is that it lays out optimal technical specifications to ensure the audience has the best experience possible			0
for that , @entity0 hires a team of very qualified touring professionals who write the rider and attempt to execute a professional and pleasant experience for all involved			0
' the letter the said ; ' part of that is making sure that the tour personnel of about 30 people plus the local venue staff are fed. contrary to what some believe , @entity0 does n’t write the rider nor make demands about his favorite snacks that must be in his dressing room			2
' most importantly however , this letter makes one thing clear above all else			0
' we recommend you try @entity166 ’s guacamole recipe , ' says the author			0

@entity0 's backstage demands for a performance at the @entity24 were published by the student newspaper
it was also made clear there should be no bananas anywhere in the building
@entity0 was angry with the paper as they also revealed his $ 80,000 *fee* for the performance
