by @entity0 in @entity1 last updated at 1:46 pm on 1st march 2012 a joke about the 9/11 terrorist attacks on @entity5 was cut from @entity7 's new film so that he could win an @entity8 , it emerged today			1
the 39 - year - old @entity10 star of the silent comedy @entity12 scooped the @entity14 statue at the @entity15 in @entity16 on sunday			1
but what many of the @entity5 voting for him did not know was that he produced and acted in a potentially devastating sketch in @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , which he is currently promoting in @entity10			1
graphic : the @entity10 advertising authorities banned this poster of @entity20 after complaints that it was degrading to women , but @entity7 apparently feared the deleted 9/11 scene would do most damage to his @entity8 hopes			1
a source close to the makers of @entity20 confirmed that @entity7 played a cheating @entity10 businessman in one of the scenes cut out of the film , which went on show in @entity1 this week			2
in the removed extract , the @entity10 had travelled to @entity38 to conduct an affair , while telling his wife that he was working hard in an office in @entity42			1
as he is about to seduce his lover in a hotel room , the businessman receives a phone call from his wife and tells her : ‘ yes , yes , my darling , everything is fine ! ’ triumph : @entity7 ( right ) pictured with his wife @entity49 at the 2012 @entity51 @entity50 starring role : @entity7 ( left ) , with @entity54 - @entity10 actress @entity53 , danced into the @entity15 's hearts in the artist			1
the silent film won three @entity15 , including best actor for @entity7 , best director for @entity59 and @entity8 meanwhile , the september 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 can be seen starting outside the window behind him , as a passenger plane flies in to the @entity64			1
original news footage was used in the sketch			1
the source said : ‘ yes , the scene was considered too much for @entity5			2
it would have been provocative , especially in the run up to the @entity15 and other awards			2
’ neither @entity7 , nor the official publicists of his film , were immediately available for comment			2
@entity20 has already been attacked in @entity10 for being shockingly sexist			2
in a publicity photo for the film , @entity7 grips a pair of naked women 's legs open , under the caption : ' i 'm going into another meeting '			2
on the promo trail : co-stars @entity7 ( @entity85 ) and @entity86 share a laugh on tv show ' @entity88 ' while promoting their new film @entity20 @entity91 newspaper warned before the @entity15 that @entity5 ' does n't joke about this kind of saucy picture ' and the artist could suffer ' collateral damage ' from the controversy			0
what is certain is that @entity5 never joke about september 11th 2001 - one of the darkest days in the history of the @entity5			0
nearly 3000 people died in the four coordinated attacks by suicide bombers on @entity38 and @entity103 one of @entity12 's competitors for the @entity8 - which it won - was the @entity105 ' , which many believe had solely been nominated because it was considered a ' patriotic ' film			0
controversial : @entity108 faced demands that she should return her best actress @entity8 after saying she doubted the official account of the 9/11 terrorist attacks it is not the first time that a @entity10 @entity8 winner has been involved in a 9/11 controversy following an @entity8 win			0
in 2008 it emerged that @entity108 , who had just won @entity110 for her portrayal of @entity120 in @entity121 , doubted the official account of the terrorist attacks			0
footage from a @entity1 talk show showed her questioning both the @entity38 attacks , and the 1969 moon landing			1
' i think we 're lied to about a number of things , ' said ms @entity108			0
referring to the destruction of the two @entity64 buildings , ms @entity108 said : ' we see other towers of the same kind being hit by planes , are they burned ? there was a tower , i believe it was in @entity140 , which burned for 24 hours			1
none of these towers collapsed			0
and there [ @entity38 ] , in a few minutes , the whole thing collapsed			0
' ms @entity108 suggested that the towers , planned in the early 1960s , were an outdated ' money sucker ' which would have cost so much to modernise that it was easier to destroy them			0
her words - which she later claimed were taken out of context - led to calls for her to give her @entity8 back			0
@entity153 over diplomatic matters have been fraught in recent years , mainly because of @entity1 's refusal to support the @entity5 - led invasion of @entity157 in 2003 .			0
