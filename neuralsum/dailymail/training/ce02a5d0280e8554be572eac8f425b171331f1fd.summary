' ' we were looking for a kitchen and a design guy from @entity3 came to design and plan it			1
fortunately the replacement did n't extend to the washer and drier , which remain in place the sink and a chest of drawers holding it up are all that remains in what used to be the family 's kitchen the old kitchen , including the tiling , was taken to a skip as they thought their upgrade was being delivered yesterday ' he was with us for three hours and he was lovely			1
he planned it all and gave us a quote and then we just had to make a few tweaks before they said it would be ready on monday			0
' i feel stupid because i have recommended them to a colleague and i 've had to go back and tell her what 's happened to us , in case they have the same problem			0
