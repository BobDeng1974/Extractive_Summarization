with its amiable discussions on greenfly and compost , it may seem as innocuous as a radio show could be			1
so regular listeners to @entity7 ’ @entity5 will be surprised to find it caught up in a race row			0
for an academic claims that @entity11 ’s long - running programme is spreading covert racist stereotypes disguised as horticultural advice			1
the panel from @entity11 's @entity5 , which has been criticised as being full of racial language dr @entity16 , a senior lecturer in sociology at the @entity18 , says the panel show is ‘ saturated ’ with racial language			1
from debates about native and non-native plant species to advice about the purity of different soil types , the programme ’s resident green - fingered experts are secretly feeding nationalist and fascist fantasies , he claims			1
speaking on another @entity11 programme , thinking allowed , he said : ‘ gardeners ’ @entity5 is not the most controversial show on @entity11 , and yet it is layered with , saturated with , racial meanings			1
the context here is the rise of nationalism			0
the rise of racist and fascist parties across @entity42			1
nationalism is about shoring up a fantasy of national integrity			0
my question is , what feeds nationalism ? what makes nationalism powerful ? ’ dr @entity16 said there is a ‘ crisis in white identity in multicultural @entity53 ’ caused by the fact that ‘ white culture ’ is historically associated with racism and far - right views			1
white people are therefore forced to find other ways of talking about white identity – such as through gardening – so they do not appear to be racist			2
speaking on the same programme , @entity62 , a crossbench peer and former professor of cultural studies , agreed with dr @entity16 ’s argument			1
she added : ‘ i remember back in the late 80s - early 90s when rhododendrons were seen as this huge problem , and people were talking about going out rhododendron - bashing			0
dr @entity16 said he believes the programme is saturated with racial language ‘ that was at a time when paki - bashing was something that was all too prevalent on our streets			1
this kind of slippage of language into alien and native is a thread in our language			0
’ it is not the first time @entity7 ’ @entity5 has been embroiled in a race row			0
in 2008 , listeners complained after a plant known as a ‘ black man ’s willy ’ was mentioned			0
the @entity11 was accused of ‘ pandering to political correctness ’ after it apologised			1
last night horticulturalist @entity94 , who was on the programme for 13 years , said dr @entity16 ’s claims were ‘ utterly absurd ’			1
‘ many things have been said about @entity7 ’ @entity5 , but you ca n’t say it is racist , ’ he said			2
‘ his comments show a complete lack of understanding of the natural world			2
‘ gardeners understand the fluidity of species over space and time			0
‘ they come and go , and adapt to different environments			0
that is what we mean by native and non-native species			0
it has nothing whatsoever to do with nationalism or racism			2
‘ there is enough real racism in the world without looking for it in places it does n’t exist			2
’ a @entity11 spokesman said : ‘ the passing mention of @entity7 ’ @entity5 was part of a broader discussion about language and race ... the comment simply reflected the programme ’s use of accepted gardening and horticultural terminology			1
’ @entity136 : the show ’s experts often warn gardeners of the dangers of introducing foreign species of plant to a garden , and the importance of weed control			2
but is this actually a racist code ? @entity147 : according to dr pitcher , nationalists often use the metaphor of soil to discuss ethnic purity			1
are the @entity7 ’ @entity5 discussions about compost and soil types as innocent as they seem ? @entity157 @entity156 : a 2008 episode outraged some viewers when a caller asked for advice on how to care for the perennial climber , commonly known as ‘ black man ’s willy ’			0
@entity165 : to most gardeners , it is no more than a simple garden implement			0
but in @entity170 , the word has long been a derogatory term for @entity172 , equivalent to n * * * * *			0
@entity173 : listeners often call in asking how to rid their broad beans of the pesky black bean aphid , commonly known as blackfly			0
but is there a secret racist subtext ?			2
