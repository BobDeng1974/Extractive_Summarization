by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 02:37 est , 28 march 2013 @entity1 was today accused of behaving like @entity2 after demanding even more mobey from the @entity5 taxpayer			1
there was fury from ministers as the @entity9 asked the @entity5 to find an extra £ 1.4billion to cover a shortfall in this year ’s budget			1
all member states are being asked to stump up a total of £ 9billion to cover overspending on regional development projects			1
begging bowl : @entity5 politicians condemned the @entity9 for demanding more from taxpayers , likening the move to the plea in @entity2 for more food a £ 415million chunk relates to projects run by the @entity25 ’s foreign service headed by @entity26 , whose members have already come under fire for their lavish spending on chartered planes and diplomatic residences			1
the budget shortfall costs more than the controversial £ 8.5bn @entity34 bailout			1
but it can not be vetoed and only needs to be passed by a simple majority of the 27 member states			0
it has been demanded by disgruntled @entity25 officials who have only reluctantly accepted hard - won cuts to the @entity41 from 2014 to 2020 negotiated by @entity42 last month in a marathon session			0
they made it clear they would veto the deal if unpaid bills for 2012 and 2013 - equivalent to around £ 77 per @entity5 household – are not paid this year before the budget cut comes in			1
in a terse statement yesterday , the @entity25 ’s commissioner for @entity52 , @entity53 said members ‘ should not be surprised ’ at having to pay these extra costs			0
and he accused members – led by @entity42 - who say the @entity25 should embrace austerity of acting like ‘ ostriches ’ by burying their heads in the sand as the bills for such projects mounted up			0
@entity41 budget commissioner @entity53 ( left ) said national politicians should not be surprised at his demand for more money but @entity69 mep @entity68 said that at a time of family budgets being under strain , the @entity25 was out of touch mr @entity53 said : ‘ this is creating a snowballing effect of unpaid claims transferred onto the following year			1
the ostrich policy can only work for so long : postponing payment of a bill will not make it go away			0
‘ not one cent of the extra amount we request today is for the @entity25 institutions , it will merely allow the @entity25 to pay its share of projects that member states agreed to start in the past			0
’ @entity89 , the financial secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ this is a totally unacceptable request from the @entity9 at a time when most @entity25 member states are taking difficult decisions to reduce public spending			1
‘ it is extraordinary that the @entity9 should demand an increase in the @entity25 budget that is bigger than the rescue package that was agreed for @entity34 earlier this week			1
’ @entity68 @entity68 , who leads the @entity69 group in the @entity25 parliament and sits on its budget committee , said the @entity25 was behaving like ‘ the @entity2 of international organisations ’ – always asking for more , when it would not be clear until the autumn what the final bills will be			2
he said : ‘ it is hard to understand how the @entity9 can justify this increase in the @entity25 budget , long before bills from member states are even through the door			2
‘ at a tough time for ordinary families and citizens across @entity41 , @entity25 spending can not be out of touch with the problems of the real world and people deserve some more answers			2
’ among the schemes which receive this funding are adult education and language exchanges for university students , development and environmental projects in rural areas , and improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector			0
the think tank @entity131 say the way this money is distributed is seriously flawed because if a rich region or country carries out an infrastructure project they must claim the money from @entity25 , which has already been footed by their taxpayers , creating unnecessary bureaucracy			0
the @entity25 has accused leaders like @entity42 of behaving like ' ostriches ' by burying their heads in the sand on the need for more money they say reforming it so only poorer nations can access infrastructure funding , while richer nations save money by funding their own , would save @entity5 £ 4billion over seven years			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity9 and @entity159 ’ demands for extra cash are unreasonable given the squeeze on national budgets and present a direct challenge to the @entity5 and other national governments ’ decision to cut the @entity25 ’s long term budget from 2014 onwards			1
‘ the @entity25 needs to accept that circumstances have changed and that any outstanding projects should be funded from cuts elsewhere in the budget , for which there is ample scope			0
’ the @entity25 say the estimates for these projects have gone up and they are under contract to foot the bill to avoid legal action or fines			0
members pay a share of the budget according to their economic strength – so if the budget amendment is passed @entity176 foots the largest bill followed by @entity179 then @entity5 .			2

@entity182 demand from @entity9 to help plug £ 9billion shortfall likened to plea in @entity187 ' novel for more food
@entity5 politicians brand move ' unacceptable ' and ' out of touch '
budget black hole is bigger than bailout needed for stricken @entity34
