many @entity1 people are now too embarrassed to fly the @entity2 – because they think the nation 's flag has become too ‘ chavvy ’			1
almost a third would not display the flag because it has become associated with football and lager louts , a social anthropologist @entity5 has said			1
a quarter were put off by its links to far right extremists , she said			1
( file image ) miss @entity5 , co-director of the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , said the shunning of the flag by middle @entity1 had now become a ‘ class problem ’ rather than a political one			1
speaking at the @entity24 , she said most people in this country are ‘ closet patriots ’ but fear being judged by their peers if they embrace it			1
she said : ‘ 30 per cent do n’t fly the flag because for them , it ’s associated with football and the phrase they used is – i do n’t like the word , but they said it ’s a bit chavvy to fly the flag			1
so it ’s got lower class associations			0
‘ it ’s almost more of a class problem that the flag has now rather than a political problem			2
’ @entity5 , author of the bestseller watching the @entity1 , said her research showed 83 per cent of people in @entity1 feel some pride in their country , with only three per cent never taking pride in it			1

above , @entity62 supporters march with the flag she said her research showed that we are a ‘ nation of closet patriots ’ but that we valued ‘ the importance of not being @entity71 ’ and felt ‘ embarrassed ’ about the big open shows of patriotism seen in other countries			2
‘ there ’s this notion that the @entity1 lack all patriotic feeling , ’ she said			1
‘ we take a bit of pride in our lack of national pride			0
’ another factor is that the national flag has in recent years been embraced by far - right extremists , she said			2
‘ there are about 25 per cent of people for whom the association with the far right and racism puts them off flying the national flag , ’ she said			1
‘ although actually 60 per cent of people would like us to embrace @entity53 , and fly the flag , 25 per cent of people do not do it because of those associations			1
‘ but if you think about it , the flag was only available for appropriation by extremists because the rest of the population already shunned it			2
‘ that ’s how they were able to steal it – to highjack it			0
’ @entity5 also spoke about the impact of the internet and social media on our national identity , saying it had helped us become less reserved			0

it ’s a bit like being drunk			0
‘ the @entity1 online are uninhibited			2
‘ it ’s like you ’re down the pub. ’ on our use of vocabulary , said that we collectively enjoyed feeling that we had the power of foresight over our lives , which is why many @entity1 people enjoyed using the word ‘ typical ’			1
she said : ‘ you have to be able to say it in a way that sounds simultaneously peeved but also stoically resigned and shruggy			0
‘ and at the same time smugly omniscient - almost pleased that your predictions have been fulfilled			0
everything may have gone pear shaped but you have not been taken unawares			0
’ and on tea , the nation ’s favourite drink , she said she had underestimated its ‘ magical properties ’ when she joked about it in the first edition of her book			0
she said : ‘ of course , the next thing i saw was that , in the 7/7 bombings in @entity142 , concerned shop keepers rushed out to give aid and comfort to the walking wounded			0

‘ you can imagine those shop keepers looking out and thinking oh god , i ’ll put the kettle on			0
