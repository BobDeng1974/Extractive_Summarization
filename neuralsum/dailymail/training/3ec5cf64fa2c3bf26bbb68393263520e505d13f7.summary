@entity2 bowler @entity0 took a remarkable nine wickets for 52 runs from 12 overs on wednesday @entity0 rewrote @entity2 's history with 15 wickets in 20 overs in their innings victory over @entity11 the 28 - year - old paceman helped @entity2 to bowl out @entity3 for just 82 runs in their first innings @entity29 v @entity28 - highlights in the second innings , @entity0 claimed another six wickets to reach 15 wickets for the match - and the day - surpassing @entity35 's 19 - year - old @entity2 record			1
@entity35 previously took 14 - 177 against @entity36 in 1995 but @entity0 's figures of 15 - 95 means he is the first @entity2 bowler to take 15 first - class wickets in a match			1
and after play finished , @entity0 was embraced by @entity35 on the balcony			0
@entity0 dismissed @entity43 for a duck , with a score of just one on the board , and then continued to take wicket after wicket before claiming @entity11 ' final batsman @entity50 for two runs to wrap up the innings			2
and , after forcing @entity11 to follow on , @entity0 then claimed another six wickets as @entity11 ' crumbed to 90 all out in their second innings			2
he was later given a rest , having bowled 20 overs - in between a lunch and innings break - and @entity60 and @entity61 completed an innings and 219 - run victory for @entity2			2
@entity64 dismissed @entity43 for a duck , with a score of just one on the board @entity2 's @entity0 sends the bails flying as he bowls @entity70 ' @entity69 on day three @entity71 bowler @entity14 took @entity11 ' eighth wicket to deny @entity0 the chance to claim all 10 last season 's @entity75 winners @entity2 had put the visitors into bat at the @entity79 after posting 392 in their first innings			1
captain @entity81 ( 101 ) and @entity82 ( 136 ) both made centuries and set a @entity84 fifth - wicket stand of 187			1
@entity87 's remarkable spell appears to have put the final nail in the coffin of @entity11 ' @entity91 status			0
they sit bottom of the table - 76 points adrift of @entity96 and 88 from safety - and look certain to lose this match too , with just one game remaining in the season			0
@entity0 rewrote @entity2 's history books with 15 wickets in 20 overs in their innings victory over @entity3			1
but what else is known about the 28 - year - old seamer ? few outside @entity2 , and perhaps not that many inside either , will be able to tell you much about an unheralded @entity109 cricketer who is making the most of his second shot at the professional game after being released by his current employers seven years ago			1
undeterred , the @entity115 - born cousin of @entity2 and former @entity71 wicketkeeper @entity116 , fought his way back into the reckoning after spells selling satellite dishes and working in a call centre			0
in that time , coincidentally , @entity11 were one of two other counties to reject him after a trial - and @entity0 went back to club cricket with @entity115 to try to catch @entity2 's eye again			2
it worked - and in 53 first - class matches before his date with destiny in an end - of - season championship fixture at home to relegated @entity11 , he had taken a 167 wickets at a laudable average of 26.5			0
@entity134 , @entity0 cuts a throwback figure to another recent @entity2 favourite @entity137 - and he was a near ever - present in his team 's unexpected march last summer to a third championship title in six seasons			0
others then grabbed most of the headlines nonetheless , but this time the limelight is his alone .			0
