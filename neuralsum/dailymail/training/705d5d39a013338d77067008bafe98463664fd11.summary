by @entity0 published : 14:23 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 15:23 est , 16 april 2013 @entity1 , an ultra-liberal former @entity2 , and rep. @entity3 , a right - wing flamethrower from @entity5 , were the first two national figures to politicize monday 's @entity8 massacre			1
@entity3 said in an interview with the conservative @entity11 magazine that the @entity13 's immigration reform bill should stop dead in its tracks , reacting to early reports that a @entity17 suspect in the @entity18 on a student visa had been detained for questioning			1
@entity1 said tuesday on @entity21 , as reported by @entity22 , that the bombing attacks at the @entity24 showed that @entity26 ' calls for tax cuts could hinder the federal government 's responses to terror attacks and other tragedies that local governments are n't equipped to handle on their own			1
' i 've updated leaders of @entity51 in both parties , ' @entity41 said , ' and we reaffirmed that on days like this there are no @entity26 or @entity55 -- we are @entity18 , united in concern for our fellow citizens			0
' but the 73 - year - old @entity1 , no longer a member of @entity51 since his retirement in january , never got the memo			1
' part of the answer ' to the question of how to make @entity65 feel safe again , he said , ' is , and i have to repeat this : maybe we 'll resist this [ idea of ] " oh , let 's have less government			0
let 's reduce the resources			0
" ' ' no , let 's continue to build up security , ' @entity1 argued			2
“ and then , by the way , as a practical matter this is very expensive for the city of @entity8			2
... i hope that we will be able to find some revenue so that @entity8 does n’t have to pay for this absolutely necessary expenditure			2
' @entity21 anchor @entity82 challenged @entity1 , asking him , ' do you feel like you 're capitalizing and making political hay of this event that happened ... that you 're making a political argument about revenue right now ? ' ' yes ! exactly ! i 'm talking common sense ! ' @entity1 responded			1
@entity90 was one of the liberal lions of the @entity18 @entity92 until his 2013 retirement			0
the only openly gay congressman during his tenure , he was seen as a reliable vote for left - wing social causes and liberal tax policy right - wing firebrand @entity3 of @entity5 said the @entity13 should scrap plans to provide conditional amnesty to illegal immigrants , given the possibility that the @entity8 attacks were carried out by foreign nationals			1
@entity3 is among the most reliably conservative members of @entity51 ' i 'm saying that if the sequester had gone through , ' @entity1 continued , ' and we had not had enough money , we could n’t be able to do this			2
yeah , i 'm making an argument about reality , and that ’s the only responsible response			0
' @entity1 added that he hoped some people - referring to those on the political right - would be ' less enthusiastic about reducing our ability to respond to a crisis like this			1
' also on tuesday , @entity1 told @entity119 anchor @entity118 that @entity18 should be ' grateful that we had a well - funded , functioning government			1
' ' it is very fashionable in @entity18 , and has been for some time , to criticize government , belittle public employees , talk about their pensions , talk about what people think is their excessive health care			0
here we saw government ... perform very well			0
. ' you know , ' he added , ' i never was , as a member of @entity51 , one of the cheerleaders for less government , lower taxes			0
' ' no tax cut would have helped us deal with this , or will help us recover			0
' on the other side of the political aisle , ideological worlds away , @entity3 told @entity11 that @entity51 should n't rush immigration reform legislation because the government does n't yet know if foreign national weer involved in the @entity8 bombings			1
' some of the speculation that has come out is that yes , it was a foreign national and , speculating here , that it was potentially a person on a student visa , ' @entity3 said			0
' if that 's the case , then we need to take a look at the big picture			0
' a @entity17 student was initially reported to be a detained suspect , but authorities subsequently ruled him out , noting that a @entity8 bystander had tackled him to the ground for merely acting ' suspiciously			1
' @entity3 favors the border security portion of legislation reportedly finalized monday by the so - called ' @entity164 ' in the @entity13			2
but a plan to provide illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship , he said , should be delayed at a minimum			1
' we need to be ever vigilant , ' he told reporter @entity171			0
' we need to go far deeper into our border crossings			0
... if we ca n’t background - check people that are coming from @entity17 , how do we think we are going to background check the 11 to 20 million people that are here from who knows where ? ' @entity13 leaders will introduce their bill on april 19 , after @entity8 attacks forced the postponement of an event originally scheduled for april 16			1
@entity3 leads a group of republicans who have said they will try to block @entity13 - originated immigration legislation in the @entity92 .			2

right - winger wants to ice @entity13 talk of citizenship pathway for illegal immigrants , citing @entity17 student now ruled out as a bombing suspect
@entity198 former congressman urges *opposition* to tax cuts and shrinking government , citing ' very expensive ' responses in @entity8
asked if he was ' making political hay of this event , ' @entity1 replied , ' yes ! exactly ! i 'm talking common sense ! '
