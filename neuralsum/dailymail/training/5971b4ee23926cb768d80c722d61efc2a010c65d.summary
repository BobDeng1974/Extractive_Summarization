peering into the mirror , i carefully apply a thick layer of a fetching coral pink lipstick			1
but i ca n’t help but feel i look slightly like a small child who ’s got hold of her mother ’s make - up bag			2
that ’s because i ’m not wearing it on my lips , but have smeared it around my eyes			2
i ’m trying the latest internet beauty tip , which suggests that , when it comes to dark circles around the eyes , lipstick could be the secret weapon we ’ve all been looking for			1
last week , websites and forums were buzzing with the news after a beauty blogger revealed her unconventional approach in a video posted on @entity26			1
in the video , @entity39 starts her make - up routine by taking an eye - shadow brush , dabbing it on the lipstick and then tapping the colour around her eye wherever she has dark circles or blemishes			1
she blends it with the brush until she has two raccoon - style orange circles around her eyes and then continues with the rest of her make - up , using a sponge to apply concealer over the top of the lipstick			2
the result is impressive and , as celebrity make - up artist @entity59 explains , while it might sound — and look — peculiar , it makes perfect sense			2
‘ dark circles around the eyes tend to be blue or purple in tone , ’ @entity59 says			1
‘ when you look at a colour wheel [ a visual representation of all the colours of the rainbow , arranged according to how they relate to each other ] , those shades sit directly opposite the corally oranges , which means that the lipstick should help neutralise the darkness			1
’ she adds : ‘ it ’s similar to the way in which people with very red tones in their skin are advised to use a green colour - correcting cream to cancel out the redness , because green and red are opposite each other on the colour wheel			1
’ during : @entity28 ( pictured ) bravely opted to try out the new beauty craze sweeping the internet which involves using lipstick to cover up under eye dark circles like many people , i seem to be permanently cursed with dark circles around my eyes , irrespective of how much sleep i ’ve had			1
dark circles happen for a number of reasons			2
because the skin around the eye area is thinner than elsewhere , the blood vessels beneath the surface are more apparent , giving a darker appearance — and while sleep , a healthy diet and avoiding cigarettes and alcohol can help alleviate the problem , some people , like me , are genetically predisposed to looking like pandas			1
so , if you ca n’t get rid of them , you have to cover them up			2
over the years , i ’ve tried almost every concealer going			0
everyone swears by the reflective powers of @entity118 ’s @entity117 ( £ 25 ) , but the texture is light and i felt i needed heavier coverage — and while its light - reflecting properties work well in real life , if you ’re photographed with a flash , because of the way it bounces back light you can look like you have white stripes under your eyes			0
then there was @entity130 ’s @entity129 ( £ 29.50 ) , which definitely did cover , but felt a bit cakey , with a tendency to sit in creases			0
currently , i ’m using @entity136 ’s @entity135 ( £ 17.50 ) which is n’t bad , but has a tendency to dull my skin			1
which was why , when i heard about this new approach , i was intrigued enough to give it a go			0
although the video suggests using a deep orange - red lipstick , @entity59 recommends i try something a little less dramatic			1
‘ @entity146 ’s got a darker skin tone than you , so i think that the shade she ’s used will be too dark			1
i ’d recommend something that still has those orange tones , but is more coral than fiery orange			1
’ i decide to try @entity130 ’s @entity152 in @entity153			0
it ’s sheer — anything sparkly would n’t work — but has a good amount of pigment			0
because i ’m putting on more make - up than usual , @entity59 advises that i use an eye cream first to keep the area well hydrated to avoid the end result looking caked on			0
rather than messing around with a brush — who has the time ? — i decide to simply scrawl it directly on to my face , under the eyes and into the eye socket , where i also have dark marks , before smudging it slightly with my ring finger			0
although i feel a bit stupid , the feel of the lipstick on my skin is n’t that strange			1
because it ’s a sheer lipstick , it goes on easily , does n’t drag the skin when i smudge it , and does n’t feel like it ’s too heavy			1
after : @entity28 ( pictured ) was impressed by the results but did not like the fact that she felt like she was caked in make - up i ’m still not convinced it is going to work , but i let it sit for a minute as many cosmetics need a bit of time to ‘ set ’ , and then , as per instructions , begin to apply my regular concealer over the top			1
‘ use your finger or a sponge to press the concealer on top of the lipstick , ’ says @entity59			0
‘ if you use a sponge with a pointed tip , you can get right into the corner of the eye and up to the lash line			0
but press , do n’t rub , or you ’ll mix it all together and end up with a pink mess			0
’ gradually , i build up the coverage of my concealer over the top of the lipstick and , to my surprise , it looks like it ’s working			0
when i ’ve finished , the dark circles are gone — as has the coral lipstick			2
but whereas my concealer often looks chalky , the combination of the pinky - orange tones , and the glossy formulation of the lipstick underneath , means that the end result is warmer , more radiant and more natural			2
on the downside , i do feel like i ’m caked in make - up and i ca n’t help feeling that using a better concealer — or even blending a touch of lipstick into my concealer before applying it — might be a better , and more lightweight , solution			0
this is especially the case as the day goes on , and the heavy make - up begins to settle into the fine lines under my eyes , leaving creases			0
it ’s not something that i ’d do every day , but for an early morning meeting when i ’m feeling bleary eyed , it ’s a useful trick to have up my sleeve			0
for now , though , my search for the ultimate concealer continues .			0

beauty blogger , @entity39 , revealed the unusual method last week
a colour wheel demonstrates which colours balance each other out
coral oranges neutralise blue or purple tones , reducing the darkness
those with red tones in their skin should use the colour green to offset it
here , @entity28 tries out the new method for @entity254
