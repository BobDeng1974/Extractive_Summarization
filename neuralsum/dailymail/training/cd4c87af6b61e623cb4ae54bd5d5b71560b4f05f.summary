by @entity0 published : 20:40 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 02:43 est , 21 november 2012 shocked : @entity1 , the @entity3 mp and chairman of the @entity5 , said the scale of the problem was ' staggering ' celebrities , small firms and large corporations are among those robbing @entity13 of around £ 5billion of tax revenue every year , a damning report reveals today			1
the investigation , by the @entity15 , lays bare the ‘ staggering ’ scale of tax avoidance – and warns that @entity19 is struggling to control the epidemic			1
the government spending watchdog says some 2,289 tax avoidance schemes have been disclosed to @entity19 by experts over the last eight years			1
but @entity24 , head of the @entity15 , said the disclosure regime , introduced in 2004 , ‘ has had little impact on the persistent use of highly contrived schemes which deprive the public purse of billions of pounds ’			0
tax avoidance is legal while tax evasion , which involves fraud or deliberate concealment , is not			2
according to @entity19 ’s own definition , tax avoidance is ‘ using the tax law to get a tax advantage that @entity38 never intended ’			2
but the report reveals how @entity19 wins more than eight in ten tax avoidance cases which end up in court , a sign of how tax experts are stretching the law to the point of absurdity			1
it is currently investigating around 41,000 tax avoidance cases among small firms and individuals – but about 15 per cent have been under investigation for between five and ten years			1
probe : the investigation , by the @entity15 ( central @entity54 office pictured ) , lays bare the ' staggering ' scale of tax avoidance - and warns that @entity19 is struggling to control the epidemic and it warns these 41,000 cases are estimated to have avoided a total of £ 10.2billion in tax over several years			1
@entity1 , the @entity3 mp and chairman of the @entity5 , said : ‘ the scale of the problem is staggering			0
' people who pay their taxes promptly and in full will be dismayed to discover that the enormous level of tax avoidance taking place is overwhelming @entity19 ’s efforts to combat it			2
’ she said it was ‘ particularly galling ’ that taxes are not being paid at a time when the government ’s austerity drive is hitting essential services			0
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ my concern is that without a credible plan to resolve these cases and to stamp out future avoidance , the public will lose confidence in the tax system ’s ability to collect even - handedly what is due from all individuals and companies			0
’ the @entity15 report reveals the top five ‘ mass marketed ’ tax avoidance schemes alone have around 40,900 ‘ users ’ among small firms and individuals			1
questions : big businesses , such as @entity97 , @entity98 ( pictured ) and @entity99 , are caught up in a growing scandal about the amount of tax that they pay big businesses , such as @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , are also caught up in a growing scandal about the amount of tax that they pay			0
to make matters worse , the report says @entity19 is likely to ‘ understate the true scale of avoidance ’ , and says the problem could be even larger			0
' my concern is that without a credible plan to resolve these cases and to stamp out future avoidance , the public will lose confidence in the tax system ’s ability to collect even - handedly what is due from all individuals and companies ' @entity1 , @entity3 mp and @entity5 chairman it raised fears about specialist firms , dubbed ‘ tax boutiques ’ , which exist solely for the purpose of helping people to avoid paying tax			2
the report reveals how they ‘ stretch the rules to the limit and will typically exist only to invent and administer avoidance schemes			0
’ in each of the last four years , accountants and other tax avoidance experts have ‘ disclosed ’ more than 118 new tax avoidance schemes to @entity19 every single year			1
since 2004 when the disclosure regime was introduced , @entity19 has applied to tax tribunals against firms for not complying with the rules just 11 times			0
the maximum penalty is just £ 5,000			0
the number of tax avoidance cases which it brings to court is equally paltry			2
between april 2010 and october 2012 , just 110 cases went to court			0
an @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ @entity19 has successfully challenged over 40 tax avoidance schemes through the courts in the last two years alone , successfully disrupting the avoidance industry through a combination of legal challenge and improved intelligence on new schemes , and protecting around £ 4billion			1
