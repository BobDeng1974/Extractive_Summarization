by @entity1 reporter published : 21:40 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 07:57 est , 23 may 2013 a public housing project that began as the an architectural marvel by the man who would later design the @entity5 quickly deteriorated into an infamous slum			1
in twenty years , @entity9 , @entity8 ’s @entity7 crumbled into decrepitude and even now , 40 years after the massive public project was imploded , people are asking why			1
a 2011 documentary called ' the @entity14 , ' screening this summer in cities across the country , tells the tale of the hope - filled project ’s violent demise			1
previously , the working class residents of @entity9 had been living in dangerous squalor with communal bathrooms and unreliable electricity			0
the city commissioned what they thought was the solution : a 33 - building modern complex designed by the future architect of the @entity5 @entity44			1
originally envisioned as segregated housing — the name @entity47 came from a @entity49 airman , while @entity50 was a white man — the complex became all - black once segregation was outlawed and the whites began fleeing the inner city			1
big idea : designed by architect @entity44 , who would later build the @entity5 , @entity7 was supposed to be the answer to @entity9 's inner city housing problems success : and at first , it was			1
working class residents were wowed by their new surroundings and the complex embodied the extensive urban renewal attempts of the 1950s and 1960s sleek : though small , the apartments offered comforts and conveniences many residents had never seen @entity7 opened in 1956 to the wide - eyed awe of residents accustomed to far less from their housing			1
@entity74 spaces invited their children to play and clean contemporary décor made residents feel , according to a woman quoted in the documentary , like they were in ‘ a big hotel resort			0
’ marketing footage from the time of the complex ’s opening called it a reprieve from the ‘ crowded , collapsing tenements ’ that many of the new residents had grown up with			2
escape : @entity7 won residents a reprieve from decrepit @entity9 tenement housing , which had extensive water and electricity problems and trash - filled streets stylish : here was housing that did n't just gleam , it did so in style paradise : there were even verdant lawns where children could play and for the first few years , things were good at @entity7 and the community there thrived as 24 - hour patrols kept watch and maintenance crews kept everything gleaming			1
but by the 1960 , things had taken a turn			0
community : for the first few years , an active community flourished around the ambitious housing projects model : for a time , the project appeared to be a success and @entity7 looked like a model on which the world 's cities could base future projects occupancy started to drop as crime rose			1
lower occupancy meant less rent going to the city to cover the building ’s expenses			2
which , in turn , meant crime went up as fewer patrols were around to keep order			0
changes : but in the 1960s , things started to change			0
occupancy rates began to flag but maintenance crews still needed to be paid darkening : vandalism increased and the housing authority even installed special light fixtures that could n't be broken by kids struggle to cope : the city tried to keep up with maintenance and security costs by raising the rents evidence : malfunctioning trash incinerators were never repaired it also meant nothing got fixed			1
the once revered project started to decay			2
the city responded by raising rents and the tenants who remained were n’t able to afford it			2
they striked in 1969 , refusing to pay rent until conditions improved and the city eventually gave in			2
backlash : the tenants reacted angrily			0
they were being charged more and more for progressively worsening housing conditions and held a rent strike bitter victory : the city eventually caved to demands for improved conditions , but it was likely too late shortly after the 1969 strike , a sewage line broke and flooded units with raw sewage gutted : it was the start of a rapid downward spiral decline : it was winter and the sewage that poured from 10,000 shattered windows froze in the cold and hung there as a testament to @entity7 's failure but a water main would soon break and flood many of the buildings and surrounding area with raw sewage			1
the whole thing was declared a disaster area			0
buildings were quickly abandoned by tenants and began to fill up with drug users , criminals , and the homeless			0
by 1972 , three of the buildings would be demolished			0
two years later , the rest would go down , too			2
' the @entity14 , ' by @entity194 tells the tale of how the dream of the @entity9 project became a nightmare			0
fleeing : the city would soon declare the flooded buildings a disaster area			0
as tenants left , crime rapidly moved in history : three buildings were imploded in 1972			0
the explosions would be broadcast worldwide and create and enduring and negative image of the once great project finished : two years later , the rest of the buildings would be demolished and @entity7 would be no more @entity211 : the 55 acres on which the complex was built were bare again , just 20 years after the hopeful undertaking began			1

it was created out of a city 's hope and the *ingenuity* of the same architect who would later design the @entity5 , but @entity222 's most ambitious public housing project went out with bang just 20 years after its 1956 opening
