instead , low level misconduct probes could be carried out by elected @entity10 , police minister @entity8 suggested			1
the shift in powers could improve confidence in the police by making investigations more transparent and ensuring they were conducted ‘ without fear or favour ’ , mr @entity8 said			1
shift in powers : chief constables could be stripped of powers to investigate their own officers for rudeness or laziness on duty , a minister signalled today critics of police disciplinary systems have long complained that too many investigations are carried out ‘ in house ’			1
some senior officers have been accused of being too willing to brush allegations under the carpet or let their officers escape with only a low level penalty			1
last year the police watchdog , the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) warned that forces were ignoring or wrongly dismissing thousands of complaints that officers were rude , lazy or failing in their duty			2
ministers have already announced that all serious and sensitive allegations against the police will be handled by the @entity35 - which will be given tens of millions of pounds to take on work that was previously carried out by internal standards departments			1
but the latest move raises the prospect of forces losing all control over complaints against their officers			0
mr @entity8 , warning that policing can be too insular , says elected @entity10 or @entity52 have been lobbying ministers for more power to carry out their own investigations			1
turning a blind eye : last year the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) warned that forces were ignoring or wrongly dismissing thousands of complaints that officers were rude , lazy or failing in their duty in a speech to a conference of the @entity63 in central @entity64 , mr @entity8 will say : ‘ public confidence in the police requires appropriate action to be taken against officers when wrongdoing is identified			1
‘ and they must be sure that investigations against the police are pursued without fear or favour for those involved			2
the ‘ vast majority ’ of day - to - day policing is conducted with the ‘ utmost efficacy and professionalism ’ , he will say			0
crackdown : @entity8 , warning that policing can be too insular , says elected @entity10 or @entity52 have been lobbying ministers for more power to carry out their own investigations ‘ but when it is not , complaints of something as simple as basic rudeness can damage an individual ’s confidence in policing			1
’ having @entity52 take a bigger role in complaints has ‘ some obvious attractions ’ , he will say			0
‘ it would serve to increase accountability and transparency in the complaints system and , therefore , increase public confidence			2
’ mr @entity8 will defend the decision to abolish police authorities , which were replaced by @entity52 following elections a year ago			1
ahead of friday ’s one year anniversary of the elections , which were blighted by low turnout , mr @entity8 will say @entity52 are ‘ here to stay ’ and were an important element of democratic control of policing			1
he will say : ‘ far from shying away from our landmark reform it is our intention to reinforce , strengthen and expand this new democratic institution			0
‘ police authorities were invisible and unaccountable - the very opposite of the system we have introduced			2
‘ policing , by its very nature , tends towards insularity			0
@entity52 are beginning to take that away by being more aware of , and responsive to , the communities they serve			0
’ almost two - thirds of appeals were overturned by the @entity35 in 2011 , after forces had first ruled the allegations were unfounded			0
some 54,714 individual allegations were made against police officers and staff in 2011 - the equivalent of one every ten minutes			0
most were for officers ’ failure to do their job or for being rude to the public			0
it could mean around one in five police workers had an allegation made against them			0
one in four ( 28 per cent ) was for neglect or failure in duty - a total of 15,201 complaints - while one in six was for lack of civility , impoliteness or intolerance .			0

low level misconduct probes could be handled by @entity144
police minister @entity8 hopes shift will increase confidence in police
