@entity0 runs you through what we learned from the weekend 's football			2
this week , @entity6 supporters show their frustrations with @entity9 's tactics , @entity11 ' original back four provided @entity12 with victory in his first game in charge of @entity16 while @entity17 have lost the ability to defend set - pieces ... 1			1
the frustration of @entity6 fans with manager @entity24 ’s route one tactics is perhaps explained by the stats for their 1 - 0 defeat at @entity27			1
left back @entity28 did play the ball 11 times to winger @entity31 just in front of him – but after that the most successful passing combination in the team was goalkeeper @entity36 ’s eight long punts to the head of @entity38			0
@entity38 won seven flick - ons – more than any other striker in the @entity41 on saturday – but only four of them went to a team mate			0
@entity45 : @entity6 fans unfurled a ' @entity48 ' banner during the 1 - 0 loss against @entity27 @entity50 one : one of @entity6 's successful passing combinations was keeper @entity36 's kicks to @entity38 2			1
@entity17 started the season as set - piece experts at both ends of the field , but since @entity57 moved on have lost the ability to defend them			1
@entity61 ’s header from a @entity63 corner that bounced in the six yard box was the pivotal moment of the 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity67 , whatever the debate about @entity70 ’s red card			0
until @entity57 was sacked by owner @entity73 on december 27 the @entity72 side had conceded just four set - piece goals in 18 @entity41 matches – in the 18 following his dismissal they have let in ten			1
punished : @entity61 celebrates after heading home a @entity67 set - piece against @entity17 3			1
@entity11 picked the same back four - @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 - in all of his first three @entity41 games as @entity16 manager			1
but that defensive line - up never began together again until @entity12 named them against @entity87 in saturday night ’s 4 - 0 win over @entity87 , when the @entity89 kept their first clean sheet in a @entity41 game at @entity92 since january			1
the red card shown to @entity94 by @entity95 in @entity97 ’s 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity98 means there are now only two outfield players who have appeared in every minute of every @entity41 game for their club			1
one is @entity17 and @entity104 centre - half @entity103 , the other @entity105 midfielder @entity103			1
neither will be looking for a rest when the season ends on may 11 , though			0
@entity103 hopes to be in @entity111 ’s @entity110 squad , while 29 - year - old @entity103 is captain of @entity113 ’s squad to play in @entity114 back four : @entity80 , along with @entity79 , @entity81 and @entity82 started in @entity11 first three games as @entity16 manager ever - present : @entity17 defender @entity103 ( right ) and @entity105 midfielder @entity116 have appeared in every minute of every @entity41 game this season 5			1
@entity118 has been a bit of an unsung hero at @entity121 while @entity104 new boys @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 have been gaining all the attention			1
the 24 - year - old son of @entity129 winner @entity127 has been a consistent performer in midfield and took a starring role with both the quantity and quality of his work in the win over @entity136			0
he covered eight miles – the furthest run by any @entity41 player on saturday – but also contributed the most attacking passes of any @entity121 player including making two chances for team mates			1
unsung hero : @entity121 midfielder @entity118 has been a consistent performer for the @entity121 this season 6			1
do n’t know if veteran @entity145 defender @entity144 has an appearance money clause in his contract – but if not he should have			0
the 34 - year - old made his 54th appearance of the season in the 2 - 0 home defeat by @entity152 that leaves @entity154 ’s team clinging on to the last play - off place in the @entity156			1
@entity154 says tiredness should n’t be a problem for the @entity159 because the squad has been rotated in their 60 games this season at home and in @entity163 – but @entity144 and fellow defender @entity164 who has played 50 matches seem to have been excluded from that policy			2
selected : @entity144 , pictured against @entity168 's @entity167 , has made 54 appearances this season 7			2
getting @entity171 fit again has been a key for @entity174 boss @entity173 in the run of ten points from six games that has secured the club ’s @entity41 future			2
the @entity180 spent much of the campaign in and out of the side with hamstring trouble , and the 4 - 1 win over @entity185 was only the second time he ’s finished all 90 minutes of a @entity41 game this year			2
he proved his value – as well as scoring the @entity190 crucial third goal he gave the ball away only once in the entire game			0
key man : @entity171 shoots to score @entity174 's third goal during saturday 's 4 - 1 win over @entity185 8			2
striker @entity196 was allowed to leave @entity87 on a free transfer to @entity198 last summer after @entity199 spent a club record £ 8.5million on @entity201			0
the 25 - year - old , never given a real chance at @entity41 level after helping the @entity87 win back to back promotion , has n’t looked back since			2
he got his 20th @entity156 goal in the 4 - 2 win over @entity208 which guaranteed @entity210 ’s side third place in the table			0
taking his chances : @entity198 striker @entity196 scores his 20th goal of the season against @entity208 9			0
when @entity216 decided in february he needed a new captain for his struggling @entity219 side , he turned to fellow @entity221 @entity220			0
it ’s proved a good move – the popular 27 - year - old left back has been an inspiring leader in an astonishing run of six wins in eight games that has lifted the club out of the relegation zone			1
saturday ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity220 ’s old club @entity232 , in which he scored one of the goals , means @entity235 now need a point at @entity159 on the final day to stay up			2
captain fantastic : @entity219 manager @entity216 hugs @entity220 after beating @entity232 10			0
@entity238 of the weekend came from @entity240 manager @entity239 , who handed 18 - year - old striker @entity241 only his second start in @entity41 football for the must - win trip to @entity245			0
it paid off handsomely as the teenager , who was the youngest ever to play for the @entity249 when he made his debut at 16 , scored twice in a 3 - 0 win			0
@entity240 , six points from safety when @entity239 left promotion chasing @entity256 to take over in january , now need a point at home to his old club to stay up after taking 28 points from 19 matches under his command			0
without him @entity256 have sunk like a stone – just eight points from the last 14 matches means they wo n’t even finish in the play - off places after once looking certainties to go up automatically			0
@entity238 : @entity240 manager @entity239 handed 18 - year - old @entity241 only his second start in @entity41 football and the youngster went on to score twice in a 3 - 0 win over @entity245			0
