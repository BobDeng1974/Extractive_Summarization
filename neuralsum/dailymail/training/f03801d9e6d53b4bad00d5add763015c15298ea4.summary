the prime minister is furious at the @entity11 mp ’s decision to leave the @entity13 party , and has used speeches at the @entity13 party conference to vow to personally lead the fight to defeat him in the forthcoming by - election			1
and he insisted he cared 1,000 times more about @entity20 remaining in the @entity21 than he did about whether @entity21 left the @entity22 , insisting he only wanted to act in the national interest			0
prime minister @entity0 has branded @entity4 defector @entity2 a ' fat arse ' who has betrayed the hard work of @entity13 activists mr @entity2 , pictured with @entity28 , announced on saturday that he was joining @entity4 , but admits he could lose the by - election in @entity11 and @entity30 the @entity13 party conference has been rocked by the defections of mr @entity2 and @entity32 to @entity4			1
the moves have threatened to overshadow the @entity13 leadership ’s planned focus on the economy			2
while mr @entity0 is resigned to the fact that mr @entity32 , a long - standing @entity38 mp , will win the by - election in @entity40 , he is furious at @entity41 ’ ‘ betrayal ’			1
speaking at several parties and receptions held around the conference in @entity45 , mr @entity0 has become increasingly animated about the way mr @entity2 relied on the support of conservative activists to get elected			1
the prime minister argues that committed volunteers have ‘ knocked on doors , stuffed envelopes , licked stamps to get his fat arse on the @entity8 benches , and this is how he repays them ’			1
at another event mr @entity0 is said to have claimed that if mr reckless ' got off his fat arse and worked harder he would n't have to defect to @entity4 to save his skin '			2
the @entity13 party is expected to mount a huge effort to hold the seat , with local activists lining up to criticise mr reckless ’ decision to change parties			1
mr @entity0 has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the @entity22 , clawing back powers from @entity69 , before holding an in - out referendum in 2017			2
under pressure from @entity38 , mr @entity0 has made clear he will not argue for @entity21 to remain in the @entity22 if it is not in the national interest			0
@entity74 mayor @entity73 last night launched an extraordinary attack on @entity76 who have defected to @entity4 , claiming they were the sort of people who injure themselves having sex with vacuum cleaners in an interview this morning , the prime minister made clear he holds no love for the @entity22 institution			1
during the campaign on @entity20 independence , mr @entity0 said he would be ‘ heartbroken ’ if the @entity21 had been broken up			0
today he revealed : ‘ i feel about a thousand times more strongly about our @entity21 than i do about the @entity22			0
‘ if i did n’t think it was in @entity21 ’s interest to be in the @entity22 , i would n’t argue for it			0
i think the best answer for @entity21 is a reformed position in the @entity22 because we ’re a trading nation , we do n’t just want access to those markets , we want a say over the rules			0
but let ’s be frank , it ’s not working properly for us at the moment			0
‘ the single currency has driven process of change that has alienated in people in @entity109			0
’ in an apparent admission of the scale of the challenge , mr @entity2 yesterday confessed that he could lose his seat and become ' a footnote in history '			0
he has faced an onslaught of criticism from his former conservative party colleagues since his defection , with some openly accusing him of lying about his plans to defect			2
today it emerged a former deputy to @entity74 mayor @entity73 has also defected to @entity4			1
@entity123 told the @entity124 that the @entity76 , @entity127 and @entity128 did not “ speak the language of normal people ”			2
@entity32 became the first conservative to defect to @entity4 last month , sparking speculation that up to eight @entity131 were considering leaving the party mr @entity73 last night launched an extraordinary attack on @entity76 who have defected to @entity4 , claiming they were the sort of people who injure themselves having sex with vacuum cleaners			1
mr @entity73 vowed to take on the ' quitters , the splitters , the kippers ' who are trying to undermine the @entity13 party			1
and he mocked defectors with an extraordinary sex joke			0
he told delighted @entity13 activists : ' the @entity22 commission wants to ban vacuum cleaners on the grounds that they are too powerful			1
‘ if you do not handle your vacuum cleaner correctly , you may end up inhaling the hamster – the budgerigar through the bars of the cage			0
‘ and i have read that there are some people – probably the type who are thinking of defecting to @entity4 – who present themselves at @entity163 with barely credible injuries sustained through vacuum cleaner abuse			0
’ he suggested that @entity4 leader @entity28 should switch to become a conservative			1
mr @entity0 today also urged @entity76 not to follow the defectors			0
he told @entity169 ’s @entity168 : ‘ the point is there 's no need for anyone to defect , because if you want an in - out referendum on @entity109 , if you want action on immigration , if you want further reform of our welfare system , if you want to keep our economy growing , the only way to get that is to have a @entity13 government			2
‘ if you vote for @entity4 , you ’re more than likely to end up with @entity185 no 10 @entity186 and @entity187 in the @entity188 , repeating all the mistakes they made in the past and not giving you a choice over @entity109			0
‘ so it ’s a very straight choice at the next election , and i think the feeling at this conference is of a team coming together rot serve our country and put forward a very clear long - term economic plan f or how we can deliver in that country in the years ahead			2
