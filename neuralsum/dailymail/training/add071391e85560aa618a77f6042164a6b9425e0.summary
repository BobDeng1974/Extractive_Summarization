by @entity0 published : 23:07 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 23:09 est , 15 february 2013 social media giant @entity1 has announced that several company computers were victims of a cyber attack that occurred sometime last month			0
‘ our systems had been targeted in a sophisticated attack , ’ read the statement dated february 15			0
warning signs : often accused of being loose with user data , @entity1 recently announced it recently came under a ' sophisticated attack ' the company says the infiltration occurred when ‘ a handful of employees ’ visited a website that , in turn , infected their laptops with security compromising malware			1
this , the statement says , despite the laptops being ‘ fully - patched and running up - to - date anti-virus software			2
’ according to the statement , the compromised site installed software that bypassed internal security through a so - called ‘ zero - day , ’ or previously unseen , vulnerability and exploit the company ’s built - in protections			1
under investigation : reports say @entity1 knew about the attacks , which likely exploited a @entity35 software flaw , well before the announcement as reported by the @entity38 on friday , the security hole was a ‘ well - publicized vulnerability in @entity41 ’s @entity35 software			1
’ @entity1 says they immediately quarantined the affected laptops and alerted authorities			0
‘ we have no evidence , ’ the company stated on a blog post announcing the incident , ‘ that @entity1 user data was compromised in this attack			1
’ all atwitter : on feb. 1 , @entity51 announced a breach and 250,000 of its users ' data was potentially accessed weeks before the announcement , on february 1 , @entity1 was provided a patch for the software from @entity41 , the makers of @entity35			1
that same day , ubiquitous microblogging site @entity51 announced its security had been breached and 250,000 of its users ’ data potentially accessed			1
@entity51 then suggested that other companies had fallen victim to similar attacks			1
today 's @entity1 ’s announcement made similar claims			2
‘ @entity1 was not alone in this attack , ’ the statement read			0
‘ as one of the first companies to discover this malware , we immediately took steps to start sharing details about the infiltration with the other companies and entities that were affected			0
’ dark forces : @entity51 and @entity1 have named not their attackers , but both have claimed that multiple organizations were similarly affected @entity1 , says a @entity38 source close to the investigation , has known of the problem for at least a month			2
a @entity1 spokesman says the company chose to wait longer than the companies it claims were also ‘ attacked and infiltrated ’ made their own announcements in order to fully investigate the origin of the breach along with authorities			2
@entity1 ’s announcement does not cite @entity51 or what other specific companies were affected along with them			1
nonetheless , the events come at a conspicuous time for high - profile cyber attacks			0
in late january , both the @entity38 and @entity100 announced they ’re systems had been infiltrated by @entity103 hackers in apparent attempts to monitor the outlets ’ coverage of that country			0
meanwhile , neither @entity1 nor @entity51 have suggested who might be responsible for their security breaches .			0

*official* statement claims no user data was compromised , as far as they know
announced just weeks after @entity51 experienced similar attacks
both companies said the events were not isolated , @entity35 software vulnerability likely to blame
