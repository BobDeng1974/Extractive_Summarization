speaking generally , ms @entity221 told the @entity222 it is notoriously difficult to bring charges under @entity92 laws because victims are afraid to give evidence			2
' it is a very difficult injury to talk about , ' she said			0
' it is an abuse of their body and it is not a part of the body that people want to talk about in public			0
