by @entity0 published : 07:33 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 13:01 est , 27 march 2013 executives at @entity2 have been forced to deliver a swift and rather blunt response to the rumors they were in talks with @entity7 about taking over from @entity8 on the today show at the end of the year			1
@entity2 allegedly contacted the @entity12 anchor recently about the move and when $ 25million - a - year @entity8 , found out , he is believed to have exploded and told them he would not support their decision			1
but this afternoon , @entity2 issued a short statement simply saying : ' we are not considering replacing @entity8			1
' @entity12 anchor : @entity2 executives allegedly contacted @entity7 recently about replacing @entity8 at the end of the year when his contract runs out @entity2 executives have confirmed they were in touch with @entity7 , but not to take over from @entity8			1
they said : ' the network has exploratory talks with talent inside and outside of the network			0
but to read anything specific into that is presumptuous			0
' and @entity29 senior vp @entity30 told @entity31 in a statement : ' as we ’ve said before , @entity8 is the best in the business			1
we want him in the today show anchor chair for many years to come			0
' according to @entity31 , sources close to @entity7 say he is not interested in trading globetrotting for 4am wake up calls and he said recently that he expects new @entity12 chief @entity40 to keep his program , @entity7 360 in its 8pm time slot			1
but the rumors will undoubtedly rock the today show boat once again , which is happening more and more frequently in recent weeks			0
yesterday , it was reported that @entity8 is furious with the show 's producers as he feels they set him up by airing an interview with the controversial filmmaker who made a disturbing documentary about @entity53			1
the today co-host believes he was put in the line of fire for getting him to anchor the interview that @entity58 did with the convicted child rapist and former @entity61 assistant football coach			0
according to @entity62 : ' morale just could n’t get any lower among the cast and crew of today			0
@entity8 feels that he was set up by producers to fail by participating in the interview with @entity58			1
move : today show host @entity8 was on the brink of moving to rival network @entity70 last year , it has been claimed ' @entity8 did n’t think it was a good idea to air it to begin with			1
@entity53 is a convicted child rapist , and @entity8 ’s feeling was , let ’s talk to the victims , and not him			1
' however , he wanted to prove he was a team player and did it			0
producers thought it would generate a lot of publicity , but no had any idea it would have garnered so much controversy			0
' it was first believed that @entity8 would go to @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 , and interview @entity53 himself , but when the segment was aired on monday it became clear it was a preview of @entity87 of @entity88			1
in the documentary , @entity58 calls the legal case against @entity53 ' remarkably weak ' and claims the sexual assault @entity92 said he saw was actually a ' botched grooming '			0
he does however , agree that @entity53 was guilty of ' many , if not all , of the things he was convicted of '			0
@entity8 is said to be suspicious of the timing of the interview and wonders if the network is setting him up to fail			1
it comes just after the news anchor did an interview with @entity101 about the behind - the - scenes turmoil surrounding @entity104 's public ousting			0
the source told @entity62 : ' @entity8 is trying to do everything he can to save the sinking ship , but he just does n’t know who he can trust anymore			1
' ratings slide : @entity8 , seen left with co-anchor @entity110 , is said to have changed his mind and stay at @entity2 - his home of almost 20 years it was also revealed earlier this week that @entity8 was on the brink of defecting to rival network @entity70 last year			1
he is believed to have been was so close to making the move to @entity70 last year that everybody close to the situation thought the deal was ' signed , sealed and delivered ' , according to a report			0
the claims emerge amid reports the 55 - year - old journalist 's $ 25million @entity2 contract will not be renewed when it expires next year , after the fiasco surrounding the dismissal of former co-anchor @entity104 saw his popularity with viewers take a nosedive			2
@entity70 chiefs including @entity131 , ceo of parent company @entity133 , and @entity134 , @entity136 boss , all thought the move was confirmed , as did @entity8 's agent , according to a report in the @entity139			2
the @entity2 stalwart would have become an @entity136 personality , co-hosted the @entity143 talk show , and taken an occasional role on @entity145 , said the report , which cited @entity101			2
but the journalist changed his mind and decided to stay at @entity2 , a decision which is said to have left mr @entity131 and others ' infuriated '			2
the today show was thrown into turmoil after co-anchor @entity104 was sacked from her post , and mr @entity8 was not seen to fight for his colleague			2
the handling of ms @entity104 's dismissal prompted a backlash from viewers of the show , which is now in second place behind @entity145 in the ratings			0
dismissal : the treatment of former co-anchor @entity104 has seen some viewers desert the today show mr @entity8 's @entity164 - the television industry 's measure of popularity - has slumped from 19 last september to 9 in january			2
@entity145 host @entity168 now ranks higher than mr @entity8 in the popularity stakes for the first time			2
earlier this month it was reported that the high - profile television personality 's $ 25million contract will not be renewed when it expires next year			0
@entity174 , 37 , and @entity175 , 42 , have been named as potential replacements for mr @entity8 in news reports in the @entity178			0
