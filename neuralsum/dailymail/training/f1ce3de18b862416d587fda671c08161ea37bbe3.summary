contaminated : ms @entity6 and her husband had lunch with 11 of their friends and family members at this @entity2 in @entity16 , @entity1 within 36 hours , 13 people who ate at the restaurant , including ms @entity6 and her husband , became sick with gastrointestinal symptoms			1
when ms @entity6 went into labor soon after , she started suffering nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and dehydration in the hospital			1
doctors discovered that her baby was in the breech position , but ms @entity6 was too sick and dehydrated for them to turn the baby for a normal head - first delivery so they were forced to perform a caesarian section instead			1
' they could n't do it , ' her lawyer @entity40 told the @entity42			0
' they just knocked her out and went ahead with an emergency @entity44 contagion : @entity47 is a very contagious illness which causes the stomach and intestines to become inflamed			0
above , what the virus looks like under a microscope also known as the @entity47 in the @entity54 , norovirus is a very contagious illness that causes the stomach and intestines to become inflamed			0
symptoms of norovirus include diarrhea , vomiting , nausea , stomach pain , fever , headache and body aches			0
norovirus can also cause dehydration which can result in a decrease in urination , dry mouth and throat and feeling dizzy when standing up			0
@entity47 is sometimes described as food poisoning or the stomach flu , which is incorrect			0
while food poisoning can be a result of norovius , other germs and chemicals can cause food poisoning as well			0
@entity76 is spread by accidentally ingesting the stool of an infected person			0
this usually happens by eating food contaminated with the virus , touching something contaminated with the virus or having contact with someone already infected			0
past outbreaks of norovirus have been linked to leafy greens , fresh fruit and shellfish but any food served raw or exposed to the virus after being cooked can become contaminated			0
@entity93 at the same time ms @entity6 was delivering her baby , her husband was also experiencing the food poisoning - like symptoms and could n't support his wife through labor the way he would if he were healthy			1
blood tests later confirmed that ms @entity6 was infected with the norovirus			1
its unclear whether the same tests were performed on her husband , but she was the only person diagnosed with the virus			2
while both parents and the baby are fine , the family is suing the company for negligence , saying the restaurant failed to maintain health standards which lead to ms @entity6 getting sick and having a c - section			1
both parents out : ms @entity6 's husband @entity12 ( pictured with their first child ) also got sick and was not much help with his wife in labor because he was dealing with his own symptoms in the lawsuit they say the @entity2 failed to make sure employees washed their hands , or that the food was properly cleaned , prepared and cooked			1
they also say that the restaurant allowed a staff member to work while infected with the virus			0
the claim is currently pending with @entity132 , the restaurant 's insurance company			2

' we do n't have any indication that this lady contracted norovirus at our restaurant or that norovirus caused her to have a c - section , ' spokesman @entity147 said			1
' we do n't have any indication of a norovirus outbreak in january 2013			2
' there was an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness on a @entity138 cruise ship this month that caused more than 300 of the 4,000 on board to get sick and norovirus is the suspected culprit			2
that ship , @entity164 , is due back in port in @entity167 today , two days earlier than its scheduled 10 - day cruise .			0
