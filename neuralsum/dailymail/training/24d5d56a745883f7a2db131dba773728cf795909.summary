it was introduced last @entity1 as a special party food treat under the banner of @entity5 star chef , @entity4			1
however , the ham hock and piccalilli terrine sold by @entity8 has since proved remarkably elusive			1
one shopper has revealed that she has tried to order the terrine 13 times in recent months via the supermarket ’s website without once seeing it arrive in her kitchen			1
’ the absence of the terrine is something of a mystery and suggests either @entity8 has been unable to keep up with demand or , more worrying for @entity4 , that production has been restricted because of poor demand			1
the reviews on the @entity8 website and food blogs offers a distinctly mixed verdict , with some suggesting it has left a nasty taste in the mouth			1
the single review on the @entity8 website from a woman who lives near @entity44 in @entity45 , appears under the heading ‘ @entity46 ’			1
it adds : ‘ absolutely nothing special about this , nowhere near as good as my own @entity49 ( @entity52 recipe ) , will not buy again			2
’ @entity4 pictured outside his @entity54 restaurant in , @entity55 , @entity56 , offered a glowing description when the terrine was launched a blog on a food lovers website offers an even grimmer description , suggesting the two slices in the pack , ‘ do look alarmingly like dog food with a bit of colour added ’			1
it adds : ‘ i peeled back the cellophane and it was like someone had just farted in my face			0
’ the blog concluded : ‘ the texture was really good , it was n’t over processed and had chunks of ham alongside the broken down pulled apart pork , it was a satisfying meaty mouthful			2
‘ unfortunately that is where the positives end , because it did n’t taste too good			0
in fact it tasted just like cheap hot dog sausages			0
’ however , there were other positive reviews on the web , particularly the @entity89 website			2
one five star rating described it as the ‘ nicest pate we ’ve had in a long time ’			0
another reviewer wrote : ‘ a rather coarse terrine but tasty all the same			0
comes in two slices individually packaged which is extremely handy for picnics or packed lunch			0
has a nice mix of flavour with a kick from the pickle			0
’ a @entity8 spokesman said : ' this is a speciality product and branches do n't hold a great deal of stock - so we are sorry this has caused availability problems for this online customer			2
we are very sorry for any inconvenience caused			0
