fending off demands to ban travel from @entity6 - stricken @entity5 , the @entity50 administration instead tightened the nation 's defenses against @entity6 by requiring that all arrivals from the disease - ravaged zone pass through one of five @entity3 airports			2
the move responds to pressure from some @entity61 members and the public to impose a travel ban on the three countries at the heart of the @entity6 outbreak , which has killed over 4,500 people , mostly in @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity15 , since it emerged 10 months ago			1
beginning on wednesday , people whose trips began in @entity16 , @entity14 or @entity15 must fly into one of the five @entity3 airports performing fever checks for @entity6 , the @entity68 said			1

there are no direct flights from those nations into the @entity3 ; about 150 fliers per day arrive by various multi-leg routes			2
homeland security secretary @entity84 said ' we currently have in place measures to identify and screen anyone at all land , sea and air ports of entry into the @entity3 who we have reason to believe has been present in @entity14 , @entity15 or @entity16 in the preceding 21 days '			1

senator @entity164 , described the action as an ' added layer of protection against @entity6 entering our country '			0
the change comes as the @entity0 works to spread the word about its new protective guidelines for medical workers			1
the advice , released on monday night , had been sought by health workers after two @entity176 nurses were infected while caring for a @entity14 traveler , the first person diagnosed with the virus in the @entity3			1
the @entity0 said it 's still unclear exactly how the nurses were infected , but the stronger rules will provide better protection			1

@entity107 governor @entity187 urged the health - care workers there to use their training to educate their families and communities			0
a passenger landed at @entity194 on tuesday and following a screening was taken to a @entity121 hospital to be further evaluated for @entity6 ' keep the anxiety down			0
keep the fear down , ' he said			0
earlier @entity0 guidelines allowed hospitals some flexibility to use available covering when dealing with suspected @entity6 patients			1
the new guidelines set a firmer standard , calling for full - body garb and hoods that protect worker 's necks ; setting rigorous rules for removal of equipment and disinfection of hands ; and calling for a ' site manager ' to supervise the putting on and taking off of equipment			0
they also call for health workers who may be involved in an @entity6 patient 's care to repeatedly practice and demonstrate proficiency in donning and doffing gear - before ever being allowed near a patient			0
the @entity0 can not require hospitals to follow the guidance ; it 's merely official advice			1

dr. @entity256 , @entity137 's health minister , said tuesday the travelers will be required to fill a detailed form upon arrival at border entry points			2
' it is definitely extra work for us , ' @entity261 said			0
