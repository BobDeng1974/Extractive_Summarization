@entity0 is craving the minutes he was rarely awarded at @entity1 and the @entity3 striker revealed he is itching for a show of faith from new manager @entity6			1
on monday the 24 - year - old was gifted 90 minutes by @entity8 , and @entity0 returned the favour with two goals as @entity11 beat @entity12 2 - 0 in their opening @entity14 qualifier			1
@entity0 averaged just 48 minutes in the final @entity16 season under sir @entity17 and 58 the following year under @entity18 , but the forward is confident he can prove more than worthy of his £ 16million price - tag with more time on the pitch			1
video @entity22 is n't alone - his brother , @entity24 , agrees @entity0 was a steal at £ 16m @entity0 was gifted 90 minutes for @entity11 against @entity12 on monday in the @entity14 qualifier new @entity3 striker @entity0 is itching for more minutes on the pitch now under @entity6 @entity0 suffered under sir @entity17 and @entity18 but hopes @entity6 will trust him @entity0 reckons if the minutes come , then the goals will follow			1
the striker hopes @entity3 will show faith in his ability , but how has he averaged over the last four seasons ? 2010:11 : 68 minutes ( 6 goals , 1 assist ) 2011/12 : 67 minutes ( 9 goals , 5 assists ) 2012/13 : 48 minutes ( 1 goal , 4 assists ) 2013:14 : 58 minutes ( 9 goals , 4 assists ) ' it is good for any footballer to get a run of games , ' @entity0 said , as reported by @entity44			0
' you become more confident and play much more at ease , so to get a run would be absolutely perfect			0
' the game against @entity12 was my first 90 minutes this season , so it is just the start of things and i 'm really looking forward to it			2
' in the 2012/13 season , @entity0 averaged just 48 minutes per @entity16 match as @entity1 won their final title under sir @entity17			1
he did , however , score just one goal throughout with four assists			0
life under @entity18 the year after was worse for those on the red half of @entity63 , but ever - so - slightly better for @entity0 , who upped his average to 58 minutes a game			2
again , the faith was repaid as @entity0 upped his goal tally to nine with four assists			0
@entity0 grew frustrated at @entity1 and hopes for a fresh start at @entity71 club @entity3 @entity0 's minutes - per - game average has never been above 70 in the last four @entity16 years the forward 's switch from @entity75 to the @entity76 defied belief , with @entity22 among those saying he can not comprehend how the deadline - day £ 16m move was agreed			1
the former @entity1 defender said : ' of all the prices paid this summer , there are right backs and left - backs galore who have been bought for £ 14m , £ 15m , £ 16m ? ' how have @entity3 got him for £ 16m ? i ca n’t work it out			0
it has helped out a competitor because @entity3 are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly			0
‘ i am struggling to work out the logic , i ca n’t understand it			0
it ’s odd in two or three ways			0
' @entity0 has been scrutinised for his @entity16 record , having scored just 26 in 118 appearances , but time will only tell if the striker can take advantage of more opportunities on the pitch at the @entity76			2
@entity0 was unveiled as an @entity3 player after his deadline - day move from @entity1			1

@entity0 was rarely given 90 minutes at @entity1 under sir @entity17 or @entity18 , but the striker is eager for a full shift
@entity0 played the entire 90 under @entity8 for @entity11 on monday and scored twice against @entity12 in the opening @entity14 qualifier
@entity0 is yet to average 70 minutes or more in a season per @entity16 game
the 24 - year - old *signed* for @entity3 in a deadline - day move worth £ 16million , which left @entity22 and others struggling to comprehend price
@entity0 has been *criticised* for scoring just 26 times in 118 *top* *flight* games
