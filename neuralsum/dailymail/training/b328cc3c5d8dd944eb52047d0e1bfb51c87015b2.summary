@entity0 is laughing at the bone - juddering memory			1
his command of @entity3 is limited but he understands the question perfectly			0
with the help of universal sign language — a fist crashing against a hand — @entity0 is being taken back to his introduction to the rough and tumble of @entity3 football , when he realised artistic midfielders are not afforded the same time and space as on the continent			1
standing next to @entity0 in an interview room at @entity20 ’s @entity19 training ground , you can not help but wonder how he survives			1
he is 22 but his boyish face and diminutive frame make you think he is not long out of school			0
@entity0 left @entity25 at the age of 18 to pursue a career in @entity29 football @entity30 , rather than steel , is a quality that you would associate with this young man from @entity34			1
looks , though , are deceptive			0
@entity36 may have given @entity0 the nickname ‘ @entity38 ’ for his magical abilities but those talents would not be on show without inner steel			1
@entity0 left home at 18 to chase his dream with @entity45			1
he had to contend with homesickness and constant upheaval at the @entity49 and , given the circumstances , it would have been easy to shirk the challenge			0
but nothing was going to get in the way of his ambitions — especially not a few heavy tackles			0
‘ my parents stayed with me in @entity57 for a while , that helped at first , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ but then they went home and it was hard			0
when they left you start to appreciate how big a step it is leaving behind everything that you know			2
@entity0 made the move from @entity68 to join @entity57 side @entity45 in 2010 @entity69 was in charge of the @entity57 side when @entity0 signed , but he left before the @entity25 joined @entity0 was helped by @entity72 at @entity45 , but feels he never played with confidence and struggled @entity74 : june 12 , 1992 in @entity34 , @entity25 height : 5ft 7in weight : 11st 2lb former clubs : @entity78 ( 09 - 10 ) , @entity45 ( 10 - 13 ) , @entity79 ( loan 12 ) total transfer fees : £ 11.6m @entity82 : 128			1
goals : 19 @entity84 : 5 ‘ my home was a simple place , near a few favelas			0
the famous @entity90 was close by			0
i never had any problems in childhood , my father ( @entity85 ) worked hard to give me and my brothers ( @entity94 and @entity95 ) every opportunity			2
‘ my dad has always been passionate about football			0
but it was one of my friends ’ grandmother who told my father to get me into the soccer school			0
she said i had talent			0
i signed for @entity45 when i was 16 but moved when i was 18			1
you miss your family and friends but you have to deal with it			2
i have been away four years now and i still miss them			2
my ambition was to succeed and you have to get on with life			0
’ perhaps a family reunion at @entity114 is one of the reasons @entity0 has started to spark back into life again ; his family and the family of his wife , @entity120 , stayed with him for the festive period , meaning 18 people were squeezed into his home in @entity20 ’s @entity124 returned to @entity25 on thursday but any sadness at their departure has been balanced by @entity20 ’s schedule ; on tuesday , after all , there is the first leg of the @entity130 semi-final against @entity132 and a reunion with the man who helped entice him to @entity29			1
@entity135 pounced to sign @entity0 from @entity45 for £ 8.5million in january 2013 @entity0 was surprised at the physicality of the @entity3 game and was helped to adapt by @entity135 @entity69 was in charge at the @entity49 in 2008 when @entity45 struck a deal with @entity78 for @entity0 ; he would have liked the opportunity to work with @entity69 but his successor at @entity45 , @entity72 — a man @entity20 fans hold close to their heart — played a key role in helping him settle			1
‘ i trained with @entity45 for two days when i went to sign , ’ @entity0 reveals			1
‘ i met @entity69 and had a couple of conversations with him			1
he was helpful because it was someone who spoke @entity148			0
i never got the chance to work with him as he left in the summer i joined			1
by then , @entity72 had come in			1
training was good but i did n’t play well at @entity45			1
i did n’t have confidence			2
’ sent to @entity79 on loan , where he regained belief under @entity154 , he has thrived since @entity135 signed him two years ago			1
having missed the @entity155 , he is now a regular in @entity25 ’s squad and @entity135 has been important to his development			2
‘ he has helped a lot , ’ @entity0 agrees			2
‘ he gave me time to adapt			0
the physicality takes you by surprise			0
when you put your head up in @entity3 , you see two or three players ready to hit you			0
@entity0 has thrived at @entity20 and scored some big goals , including this one against @entity166 the @entity25 feels his @entity20 team are improving of late after a slow start to the season ‘ the intensity , the speed is what really takes time to adjust			1
you can never relax for a minute in one game			0
in @entity25 , @entity57 and @entity175 you have time and space to play the ball			1
’ movement and control , technique and vision , @entity0 has all the attributes @entity184 associates with its leading men and when a new era dawns without @entity188 the onus will be on the 22 - year - old to step forward and show why @entity135 thinks so highly of him			2
@entity0 is one of a number of players who @entity20 want to secure on long - term contracts and the idea of committing for a lengthy period appeals ; what appeals even more , however , is the prospect of winning some silverware			1
the 22 - year - old says he would be happy to stay at @entity20 for a long time and wants to win trophies ‘ the start to the season was slow but we are improving and results have been much better over the last few weeks , ’ he said			1
‘ if we could win a trophy that would be very important for the team and the club			2
‘ the major difference is the ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) system we are now playing			0
we have more options in each position			0
we press high , we are creating more opportunities and we have intensity again			0
we have our confidence back			2
‘ it is not a hot topic for me about signing a new contract			0
but i would be very happy to stay here for a long time and , maybe , i could become like one of the great players who have been here			0
i want to win trophies here of my own			1
’ @entity0 was speaking ahead of tuesday 's @entity130 semi-final first leg on behalf of @entity130 — the card in your corner			2

@entity0 left his native @entity25 aged 18 to join @entity45

@entity25 wants to stay at @entity20 and win trophies with the club
