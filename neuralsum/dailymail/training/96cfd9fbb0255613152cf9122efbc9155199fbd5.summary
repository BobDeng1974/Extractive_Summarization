by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 15 march 2012 updated : 12:13 est , 15 march 2012 a @entity2 farmer will lose a crop of 15million daffodils which bloomed early - because he ca n't get enough people to pull them out of the ground in time			1
@entity7 says severe winter weather which hit @entity9 in february delayed the flowers by a fortnight , while in @entity2 they arrived a week early			1
as a result , crops arrived at the same time north and south of the border			0
blooming nightmare : @entity7 's daffodils arrived a week early while @entity9 crops were ready two weeks late			1
as they are ready at the same time , the market has been flooded with flowers the market price will be so low that it wo n't be worth @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , pulling the flowers out of the ground			1
and despite there being 234,000 people unemployed in @entity2 , mr @entity7 has struggled to recruit pickers locally because they do n't want to do the back - breaking work			1
there are currently 100 pickers working at the farm - but mr @entity7 needs closer to 500 to bring the crop in			1
despite placing adverts in local newspapers and in job centres he has not found enough workers			0
he is set to lose £ 300,000 because the daffodils can not be picked in time			1
frustration : a solitary daffodil picker , @entity41 , 24 , works a @entity22 daffodil field			0
@entity7 needs around 500 workers - he has only 100 warm weather in @entity2 meant the crop was ready for picking one week earlier than expected			1
mr @entity7 said : ' we ’ve lost about 25 per cent of our volume because of the weather			1
that ’s 1.5 million of our bunches , each containing 10 blooms , completely wiped out			0
' every single day that we do n’t have enough pickers helping out , we are losing 150,000 to 200,000 bunches			0
' it looks like it ’s going to cost us just over £ 300,000 , which is absolutely devastating			1
' we were looking for a cold week last week , so that the growth of our daffodils will halt , but it just never happened			0
pick your own : @entity7 inspects his crop			2
if they are n't pulled out of the ground soon the market will already be flooded with flowers and the price will plunge ' instead we had really mild weather last week which has continued from november , december time			2
' when you look back at the whole winter we ’ve not even had one spell of particularly cold weather			2
' he added that the weather had conspired to bring the @entity2 and @entity9 picking seasons together			1
with all the flowers coming at once , the market has been saturated and the price has tumbled			2
he added : ' even when we finally get some pickers we ’re going to lose money , the market value will be so low			0
' our main competitors for growing daffodils are down in @entity83 and @entity84			0
down there they had that very cold weather front from @entity87 in early february			0
' @entity83 even reached -15 , -16 degrees which put their crops on hold for two weeks			0
this has meant that it ’s brought our picking seasons together			2
' even if the market was n’t flooded we do n’t have any pickers anyway , because they ’re all still down in @entity84 and @entity83			0
' we are probably ten days earlier than what we normally would be			0
we started picking on march 2 when on average we start on march 12			2
normally , the @entity9 production would be much further on at that time			0
' frustration : @entity7 is still waiting for travelling teams of pickers to arrive in @entity2 to pick his crop			1

despite 234,000 unemployed people in @entity2 , farmer @entity7 ca n't find people to do the back - breaking work
delay in picking flowers will cost him £ 300,000 in lost *revenue*
