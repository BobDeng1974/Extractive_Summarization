reigning @entity1 @entity0 will be aiming to sink his home - town club when @entity4 visit struggling @entity5 as part of a full @entity8 programme on @entity9			1
the @entity11 hooker left the @entity4 at the end of last season and , despite the switch , he has kept a close eye on events at his old club			1
' it was the only team i played for coming through as a youngster so it 'll feel a bit different being on the other side , ' said @entity0 , who is expected to recover from a busted nose sustained in thursday 's defeat at @entity25 to maintain his ever - present record for the @entity5			1
' i still look out for their results to see how they 're going and i hope they do well			2
@entity0 is ready to take on his former team - mates at @entity4 , his boyhood club ' i 've seen their games and highlights on tv and they 're probably a bit like us			1
they 've put a few good performances together and got some good wins but they 've been poor in other games			2
' i 'm not too sure what the reception for me will be , i 'll have to wait and see			0
' @entity5 coach @entity46 , who persuaded owner @entity47 to fork out Â £ 185,000 to buy the hooker out of his contract with the @entity4 last summer , believes the player deserves a good reception from the visiting fans			1
' he was super for them , he gave everything he had , ' @entity46 said			0
' i do n't think there should be any resentment towards him			0
' he was going to be lost to that club any way and the coffers that were earned from him has probably allowed them to survive a bit longer and in a much better state than they would have been otherwise			1
reigning @entity67 will lead the way for @entity5 as they try to end a three game losing run ' so they should be very grateful for his talent and hope that one day he comes home to them at the end of his career			1
but in the meantime i think he 's got a bright future with us			0
' @entity5 have won their last five home games against @entity4 but they have dropped to seventh place after suffering a third consecutive defeat at @entity25 , who have drawn the short straw over @entity9 with a trip to @entity90 as they seek a their first - ever win over @entity91			1
@entity93 coach @entity92 has made no apology for ringing the changes , as he rests a host of regulars , including skipper @entity98 , his half - back partner @entity99 and full - back @entity100			1
' it will be a completely different side , ' @entity92 said			0
' three games in eight days is atrocious when you look at what we 've gone through			0
what happens over this @entity9 period could affect us for 10 weeks			1
flashback : @entity0 says he still keenly follows the fortunes of the @entity4 and hopes they do well ' i 've got to use the squad and give others opportunities			1
@entity117 and @entity118 will play and @entity119 will come into the side			0
it gives them an opportunity to show what they can do			0
' we 'll go over there with a load of desire and purpose			0
those lads have known all week they 're going to play			0
' champions @entity132 will also be much changed as they look to avoid a third successive defeat when @entity136 visit @entity137 for the @entity138			2
@entity140 coach @entity139 has called up youngsters @entity141 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 after @entity146 and @entity147 joined his side 's lengthening injury list following the defeat at @entity151			0
former @entity154 full - back @entity152 earns his first call - up for @entity136 , who also have former @entity132 hooker @entity157 in their squad			2
it is fourth against third at the @entity160 where @entity161 will aim to continue their impressive run against a @entity151 side on a high from their derby triumph over @entity140			0
@entity161 , who are aiming to halt a 17 - match losing run against the @entity168 , are without full - back @entity169 after he was concussed in the win at @entity172 , while @entity151 coach @entity173 rests @entity174 and @entity175 and recalls @entity176 at full - back			1
@entity178 expect to have skipper @entity179 back from a three - game absence in the top - versus - bottom clash against @entity182 , who are struggling to raise a team , according to coach @entity184			2
the @entity185 , who have not won at @entity187 since 2007 , were without 12 senior players for their recent game at @entity151 and , although three returned for thursday 's home defeat by @entity91 , their injury worries worsened , with centre @entity192 among the latest casualties after undergoing emergency surgery for a ruptured testicle			1
' we picked up another three or four injuries , ' @entity184 said			0
' has a club ever not fielded a team ? we 're close to that situation			2
monday 's going to be a hard job for us , mentally and physically			0
' in monday 's other game , @entity204 hooker @entity203 will face his parent club after @entity172 raised no objections following his loan move to @entity209 .			2

@entity5 host @entity4 on @entity9
@entity0 will be facing the home - town club he left last year
*wolves* are keen to end a a three - match @entity8 losing streak
@entity219 will rest a host of regular for visit to @entity91
