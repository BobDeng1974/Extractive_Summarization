just when you thought @entity3 's infamous butt - baring magazine cover had been parodied to death here comes the @entity6 with an slightly different take on things			1
on thursday the @entity9 tweeted its own pic of an ample - bottomed sculpture that bears a striking resemblance to the one that 's got so much attention over the past 48 hours			1
' here at the @entity9 , we have artworks that can # @entity17 too ! ' read the tweet , which even adopted the hashtag that has been blowing up on social media since @entity21 revealed the cover of its winter issue			2
the photo attached to the tweet shows an ancient fertility symbol that predates @entity3 by about 6,500 years , although the @entity29 female figure is slightly shorter at 8.4 inches tall			1
the @entity9 's cheeky attempt at generating some publicity has been retweeted more than 2,000 times since it was posted on thursday morning			1
' bless whoever wrote this tweet			0
it deserves an actual visit to the @entity9 to see this , ' tweeted @ @entity40			2
while @ @entity42 joked , ' that 's obviously the only way they had in ancient times ( b4 cellphones ) to capture the beauty of @entity48 shoppers '			0
mythical beast : one internet user turned @entity3 into a beautiful centaur in a hilarious meme - after seeing her naked shoot for @entity21 magazine the original : @entity3 certainly lit up the internet after her lewd shoot came out now that 's an eyebrow raiser ! the stunner also posted a super racy naked snap of her body from the front within hours of posting the image of her oiled - up , @entity64 - enhanced behind on tuesday , the internet had gone to town with people inspired to create their own versions of the pic including everything from centaurs to docking stations			1
@entity3 may have wanted to ' break the internet ' but it seems she united the online world in finding the most comical way of parodying the lewd cover - she also posed for a full frontal snap inside			1
twitter user @ @entity84 was reminded of a mythical creature when he saw the @entity21 image , tweeting his own version with the caption : ' @entity3 looks so much like a centaur in @entity90 , i figured i 'd take it one step further			0
' @entity3 's rear becomes the rump of a horse , turning the reality star into a centaur , who certainly would n't have been booted out of the @entity99			1
the wife of @entity101 was then given the capital treatment by @ @entity103 , who joked that the @entity105 have been given a bootylicious makeover			0
having a laugh : entourage star @entity108 spoofed the picture by superimposing his head onto her body dock of the week ! @entity105 have a new style of docking stations endorsed by the mayor of @entity117 two birds , one stone : another user mocked @entity3 and @entity121 at the same time strong look : who needs couture when you can step out in this nude ensemble ? eyes on the prize : @entity3 's bottom becomes its on person with a pair of googly peepers she fits in in @entity133 ! @entity3 's cover got a @entity136 makeover ' @ @entity143 unveils new style @entity146 rack coming to the streets of the capital soon , ' the parody tweeter posted with an image of @entity140 parking his bike between @entity3 's cheeks			1
@ @entity149 killed two celebrity birds with one stone by photoshopping @entity121 's face onto @entity3 's derriere with a speech bubble exclaiming ' @entity155 ! ' food items has also been another way to describe @entity3 's glistening rear ; from peaches and potatoes to glazed donuts the internet went to the market on comparisons			1
yum yum : the reality star was morphed into a tasty hot dog by one internet user @entity169 : a lot of users compared the reality star to a glazed donut market share : the internet also found her derriere to look like a number of food items , from potatoes to peaches photoshop : she also bared a resemblance to a @entity186 doll , famous the play toy famous for it 's unrealistic body shape brits do it better : @entity3 is compared to @entity192 ' @entity3 ' proved to be an apt nickname for the reality star , and her rear was even replaced with two pieces of @entity197			2
@entity192 wearing that bridesmaid dress at her sister 's @entity199 was also used as a comparision , though really the @entity190 behind did n't really ' do it better ' than @entity3			0
another tweeter highlighted the mother - of - one 's gravitational pull by surrounding her derriere with asteroids			0
now that 's a brand : the star 's pert posterior symbolises the double o in @entity212 in one sexy meme @entity3 and the giant peach : the soft fruit was another thing that looked like her behind ooh ! someone thought her bottom was n't quite rotund enough and added a few extra inches sweet treat : @entity3 makes an appearance , while another user compares her bum to an @entity224 banging ! another food item that looks like @entity3 are two uncooked sausages , apparently the user also gave @entity3 a surrealist makeover by photoshopping her bottom onto her face for quadruple the cheeky impact			2
one user even compared the image of @entity3 to that of a @entity186 doll , as @ @entity236 pointed out : ' @entity3 literally looks like a plastic & unrealistic @entity186 doll			0
look at her waist in comparison to her body			0
' it does seem the magazine have done their best to photoshop the reality star 's waist to oblivion and make a behind look bigger than @entity249 's @entity248			0
@entity250 thinking : the star stands in a rubbish bag in another spoofy moment astronomic proportions : the reality star 's rear has serious gravitational pull in one meme , but in another she is given a surrealist makeover boredom wins : one tweeter photoshopped the @entity263 probe landing on her bum @entity265 : @entity3 certainly spices up the rock carvings of past presidents @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 flood gates are closed : there 's a new @entity275 barrier in town and it 's made of @entity3 you want some do ya ? @entity279 is the latest victim of @entity280 just under a fortnight ago , @entity3 stepped out looking far curvier as she joined her husband @entity101 at the 2014 @entity281 honouring @entity282 and @entity283			0
of course the rapper , who only follows @entity3 on @entity285 , tweeted his approval of the cover with the simple hashtag ' @entity288 '			2
however @entity3 did n't get exactly what she wanted ... the internet seems to be working perfectly fine			0
@entity292 : at the start of the month , @entity3 's waist looked more natural than on the @entity21 cover support : of course @entity101 had nothing but good things to hashtag about his wife			1
