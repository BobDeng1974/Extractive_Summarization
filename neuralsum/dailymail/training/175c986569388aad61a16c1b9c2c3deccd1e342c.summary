with @entity1 in the @entity3 relegation zone and in the worst form slump of any of the 20 top - flight clubs , @entity0 will have to get cracking the moment his appointment as the new manager is officially announced			1
here are some of the issues that need urgent attention			0
@entity12 @entity11 @entity1 's success in the last couple of seasons has been based on being solid at the back			1
under @entity18 , they conceded only five goals in nine matches ( 0.55 goals per game ) during the run that secured their @entity3 status			0
this season they conceded 30 goals in 18 games ( 1.6 per game ) with @entity29 in charge and their organisation and confidence looked shot before caretaker @entity33 led them to a clean sheet at @entity35 on sunday			0
luckily for @entity1 , @entity0 is of the school that being hard to beat is the first priority , and you can build from there			1
@entity0 is set to be confirmed as @entity1 's new manager after deciding to leave @entity41 right recruitment @entity1 need a consistent goalscorer , their main summer signing @entity46 has netted only three times so far this season			1
@entity49 was on @entity29 's radar and he would be the type to interest @entity0 too – a creator and scorer or goals , and exciting to watch			1
whether @entity55 would let him go to a @entity3 rival in january when @entity57 is away at the @entity58 is debatable but something needs to be done			0
@entity1 have also struggled in the full - back positions so expect a couple of acquisitions there			2
@entity1 were interested in @entity55 's @entity49 ( second from left ) before @entity0 's appointment unlock the key to @entity66 and @entity67 @entity0 was a big fan of @entity68 when he was manager of @entity41 but could n't persuade @entity69 to get him on the terms that @entity71 wanted			1
@entity68 has shown glimpses of his talent during his second spell at @entity75 but is still not the player who won @entity78 recognition towards the end of 2012			0
likewise , @entity67 is the best natural finisher at the club and one goal in his last eight games is below - par for someone of his talent			2
@entity18 and @entity29 did n't trust him as a regular starter but @entity0 likes a bit of flamboyance in his forwards and at the age of 24 , it is time for @entity67 to start delivering			1
@entity66 ( left ) , who is on loan from @entity71 , has failed to hit top form this season @entity93 and getting back to basics the return of @entity93 from a loan spell from @entity99 is symbolic , his goals got @entity1 into the @entity3 and they need that togetherness and spirit within the club again			1
likewise , long - serving centre - half @entity103 may be important , he is currently on loan to @entity105			0
for all the money @entity0 may get to spend in january , the diehards at the club – @entity93 , @entity103 , goalkeeper @entity108 , defender @entity109 and skipper @entity110 are vital			1
the never - say - die attitude of the dressing - room is the biggest asset @entity1 have and @entity0 's playing links to the club will help with that			1
@entity93 ( right ) , pictured scoring against @entity117 , has returned from a loan spell at @entity99 the relationship with chairman @entity120 parish is on his fifth manager in just over two years , a high churn rate given @entity1 have been successful on the pitch during that time			2
@entity127 , @entity128 , @entity18 and @entity29 have come and gone for different reasons , the only common link is @entity130 appointed and then lost them , suggesting he may be an acquired taste for any manager			0
he and @entity0 have watched games and socialised together in the past and of course @entity0 has shown his loyalty to owners before , he never let any frustrations with @entity69 at @entity41 spill over into public bad blood			2
@entity0 and his staff have a neat little trick in helping keep the club 's chairman and chief executive feel part of things , they send a private email before and after every game , explaining team selection and tactics			2
it is a sign of respect from @entity0 , he shows by doing that he understands he is the manager working for a chairman or owner			0
it should mean his relationship with @entity130 is less trained than @entity18 's was for example			0
@entity1 chairman @entity120 ( left ) has paid compensation to secure @entity0 's services get the fans behind the team @entity75 is one of the most atmospheric grounds in the @entity3 , @entity18 said where you see chimney pots , you will find real football fans , and there are plenty of chimney pots on the houses in south @entity176			1
former player @entity177 , a close associate of @entity130 , said the silence of @entity1 fans during their last home game , a 3 - 1 home defeat against @entity182 , spoke volumes and probably accelerated the need for a managerial change			0
anyone who was at @entity75 last season when @entity1 roared back from 3 - 0 down against @entity188 to draw 3 - 3 will know the fans ' vocal backing is critical to @entity1 's survival hopes			1
@entity0 was initially known as @entity193 fans in an ironic way when he played for the club , but his winner against @entity188 in the 1990 @entity198 semi-final – one of the most famous goals in the club 's history – made him a genuine hero overnight			2
@entity1 's fans are well known for creating a raucous atmosphere at @entity75 on matchdays @entity206 @entity207 , 21 , is adored by @entity1 fans and @entity130			1
at @entity75 , he is known as @entity209 as a nod towards the great @entity212 midfielder @entity211			0
@entity214 manager @entity213 , a former @entity1 player himself , has been happy to throw @entity207 into his team with @entity217 and @entity218 without suffering a drop in standards , but it has n't worked out for him at @entity1 yet , with @entity18 and @entity29 - who both prefer experienced players - sending him on loan to @entity225			0
@entity207 is due to return in the @entity226 and once he is over a groin injury , @entity0 could be the manager to unlock his talents , he has shown at @entity41 with @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 , he puts faith in younger players			0
@entity235 in midfield , @entity207 can pass and move with the best of them .			0

@entity0 is on the verge of being confirmed as @entity1 boss
his *job* is to take the @entity1 out of the relegation zone and to *safety*
@entity0 must organise @entity1 's defence and start keeping clean sheets
he needs to get more out of @entity66 and @entity67
the @entity251 boss must also make wise additions in january
