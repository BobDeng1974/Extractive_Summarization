the @entity1 catalogue appears to have been leaked online a day before the streaming service is due to launch in @entity3			1
images that claim to show the tv shows and movies that will be on offer were posted to @entity8 , listing titles including popular @entity12 series @entity10 and @entity13 and @entity3 shows including @entity15 and @entity16			0
a @entity1 spokesman would not confirm if the images were authentic , or comment on whether the company released them , telling @entity21 : ' we 're not commenting on that supposed leak '			0
the service launches on tuesday charging $ 8.99 per month for a single screen ( standard definition ) , $ 11.99 for two screens ( high definition ) and $ 14.99 for ultra definition on four screens			1
this makes @entity1 's lowest offering the cheapest tv streaming option on the market			1
but competitor @entity44 – a joint partnership between @entity46 and the @entity47 – charges $ 10 per month for @entity49 streaming on three screens			2
like @entity1 , this is inclusive of tv shows and movies			0
@entity44 's exclusive series include breaking bad spin - off @entity55 , season six of @entity58 and @entity59 along with a number of @entity47 shows			0
presto - a @entity64 - @entity63 partnership - charges $ 9.99 per month for tv shows or movies only , or $ 14.99 for both			0
all packages are standard definition			0
@entity69 carries @entity71 content and a number of older @entity74 and @entity75 series including @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 but most of those networks ' series still in production - including @entity74 's @entity82 - are not included			0
all three @entity83 ( subscription video on demand ) services are offering a free month trial			1
@entity1 will stream a range of titles from companies including @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 ( @entity95 ) and the @entity96			0
@entity13 will be available online on @entity1 , but will also screen on @entity64 acclaimed series @entity10 is available in @entity3 exclusively via @entity1 @entity1 price : one screen - $ 8.99 ; two screens - $ 11.99 ; four screens - $ 14.99 video resolution : one screen - standard definition ; two screens - high definition ; four screens - ultra definition exclusive content : @entity13 ( exclusive to @entity83 in @entity3 , will screen on @entity64 ) , @entity10 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , @entity114 's @entity113 , @entity96 films and tv shows @entity117 price : three screens - $ 10 video resolution : high definition exclusive content : better call @entity123 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity129 - 5 , @entity130 , @entity47 series @entity69 price : tv shows only - $ 9.99 ; movies only - $ 9.99 ; tv shows and movies - $ 14.99 video resolution : standard definition exclusive content : ( exclusive to @entity83 in @entity3 ) @entity140 , @entity76 , @entity141 , @entity77 , @entity142 , @entity143 , girls , @entity145 , @entity78 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity71 series the launch of @entity1 ushers in what is arguably the biggest change to the @entity3 tv landscape in decades			1
but the online streaming services will still have to convince @entity3 - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content			1
this could prove difficult , with a new @entity162 survey finding that the majority of @entity3 are still not willing to pay for tv content			2
around one in five are willing to pay up to $ 20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see			2
but this could change in future , with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young @entity3 are already utilising online streaming services like @entity44 , @entity69 , @entity172 and @entity1 .			1

@entity1 will launch on tuesday charging *subscribers* $ 8.99 per month
this makes it the cheapest tv streaming service on the market , *undercutting* competitors @entity44 , @entity69 and @entity172 by $ 1 per month
like other tv streaming services , @entity1 is offering a free month trial
but most @entity3 still say they 're not willing to pay for tv content
