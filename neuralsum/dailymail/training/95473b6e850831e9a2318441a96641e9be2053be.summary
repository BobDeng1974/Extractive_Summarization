by @entity0 published : 02:56 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 09:06 est , 23 october 2013 it was the craze that saw customers sleep outside a @entity4 bakery to be first in line outside the shop this summer			0
skirmishes broke out when those who had been queuing were unable to get their hands on dwindling supplies of precious cronuts , the flaky , fried treat that is half - doughnut , half - croissant			1
. @entity15 has since embraced the cronut madness and seen the birth of the @entity19 's own limited edition version of the doughnut - croissant hybrid , which was such as success it is to be rolled out nationwide			1
now , @entity22 has hopped on the doughnut - blend bandwagon and come up with its own flaky , fried treat : the yumdough , a yum yum - doughnut hybrid			1
yumdoughs are topped with sugar icing with pockets of filling and fondant and comes in four flavours made from 144 - layer dough , the treat is light and airy with a textured effect			1
it is topped with sugar icing with pockets of filling and fondant , and comes in four flavours : chocolate and orange ; lemon ; butterscotch and raspberry and vanilla			1
arriving today , the yumdough will be sold in 40 @entity22 branches for £ 1.49			1
there is an introductory offer of 25 per cent off			0
the original @entity51 was a croissant - doughnut pastry attributed to chef @entity53 of the @entity53 in @entity4			1
the recipe took two months and ten recipes to perfect			0
in may 2013 , the bakery trademarked the name it took @entity59 by storm and spawned a bakery black market as demand outstripped supply			0
to the delight of everyone on this side of the @entity68 , @entity15 bakers soon came up with their own take on the treat			0
the @entity19 , which comes in two flavours , berry or caramel - pecan , is made using a similar method - layers of pastry formed into a doughnut shape , fried , iced , and filled with either berry cream or caramel			2
the @entity19 came in two flavours , berry or caramel - pecan and was made using a similar method to cronut and hot on their heels , the ring - shaped yumdough : a mixture of the yum yum ( a flakier take on the doughnut , where the pastry is traditionally plaited ) and the doughnut			1
' our customers will love this delicious combination of two of their favourite sweet treats on the bakery counter , ' says @entity95 , bakery buyer at @entity22			2
' our customers love to try something new and we think they 'll find the yumdough lip - smackingly good			2
' the cronut was quietly unveiled by @entity4 's @entity53 with a small batch of 50 by creator @entity53 the cronut , which has already received interest from curious pastry chefs in @entity104 , @entity105 , and @entity106 , is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried , rolled in rose sugar , and then filled with light tahitian vanilla cream			2
rose - flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer , which peels apart ; finally , crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish			0
' a cronut is not as simple as frying up some croissant dough , ' said the chef			0
' we actually make a special laminated dough that is sheeted and folded different than a croissant '			0
man behind the invention : ' i 'm a big fan of quality over quantity ... it takes a lot to ensure all our other pastries are up to par with standards as well , ' said mr @entity53			0
