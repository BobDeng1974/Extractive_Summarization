vice president @entity0 is saluting military veterans , calling them not only the ' heart and soul , ' but the ' spine of the nation			1
' @entity0 spoke at @entity6 , where he participated in a wreath - laying ceremony in honor of @entity9			1
@entity0 singled out the generation of men and women who joined the armed forces after the sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , stating that the 3.5 million men and women of that 9/11 military generation made their decision with the near certainty they would be deployed to @entity20 or @entity21			1
@entity0 said that the @entity41 has never before ' asked so much over such a sustained period of an all - volunteer force			2
' he also acknowledged the families of those who serve in his remarks , saying , ' it ’s not just the forces on the front line that are asked to sacrifice and to serve			0
it ’s also the families			0
' @entity0 spoke of this while acknowledging his own son 's deployment to @entity20 and how difficult that was for him and his family			2

' there have actually been 52,168 wounded troops , a difference of 47,000			0
perhaps making this misstatement even worse is the fact that immediately before listing these numbers , @entity0 said , ' every day for the last six years , i ask my staff early in the morning to contact the @entity89 to get a detailed report of the number of troops deployed , the number wounded , and the number killed			2
not a general number ; the exact number every day			0
