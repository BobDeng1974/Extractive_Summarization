by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 09:46 est , 3 june 2013 a @entity2 city plans to fine mothers who have a child out of wedlock , sparking criticism that the policy is discriminatory and could lead to an increase in abandoned babies			1
@entity10 says the rule is aimed at keeping the birth rate low			1
one expert says it is the first time that out - of - wedlock children have been expressly singled out for penalty by one of @entity2 's municipalities , which have flexibility in how they enforce national population - control policies			0
@entity10 's policy to fine single mothers follows the rescue of @entity24 , whose mother took days to come forward after he slipped down a sewer pipe it comes days after the rescue of a young single mother 's newborn from a sewer pipe in eastern @entity2 prompted discussion over the stigma that single mothers face			1
' if the policy is approved , there could be more " sewer babies " because when mothers ca n't afford the cost , they might think about throwing their babies away , ' said @entity42 , a gender equality researcher at the @entity44			1
on friday , the government of the city , in central @entity47 , published online a draft updated family planning policy which it says is aimed at keeping the city 's birth rate at a low level			1
the policy says that ' the parties ' should pay the fee in cases of births that are out of wedlock or when one side knowingly has a child with someone who has a spouse			1
it has been interpreted in state media as mainly targeting unmarried mothers and women who have affairs with married men			2
the public has a week to comment on it			0
' it looks like the policy is targeted just at women from my understanding , ' @entity42 said			0
she said unmarried mothers already faced discrimination , including being barred from receiving maternity benefits from the government			0
unmarried mothers also face stigma because premarital sex traditionally has been frowned upon			0
in the case of the baby found in the sewer in @entity87 on may 25 , his mother told police she got pregnant after a brief affair , could not afford an abortion , hid her pregnancy from family and neighbours and had concerns about whether she would be able to raise the child			2
police also said she told them the baby slipped into the sewer accidentally shortly after its birth , an account they later said they accepted			2
@entity10 's proposed rule would be the first time that bearing a child when unmarried has been spelled out as a separate offence , said @entity106 , a professor of population studies at @entity108			1
gender equality researcher @entity42 said the policy could produce more ' sewer babies ' if mothers can not afford the cost of the fine ' in fact , a lot of family planning regulations have included unmarried childbearing under illegal childbearing			1
they were just not specified as a separate term as is the case this time with @entity10 , ' he said			2
' we need to distinguish between the legal and moral aspects and define what a family is nowadays , said @entity106			0
' let 's say i am single , and i want to have a child			0
is that wrong ? no , it 's not , so is it considered a family ? ' having a baby with a married man , is that considered a family ? all these details need to be specified			0
' babies resulting from an unmarried relationship or an affair with someone who is already married will provoke a ' social compensation fee ' , an official at the family planning committee of @entity10 said			1
social compensation fees are levied on people who break @entity2 's strict family planning policy , which restricts many urban couples to one child			2
the fee depends on the province and the whim of the local family planning bureau , and the children are denied education and health benefits			0
@entity47 province sets its social compensation fee at three times average annual disposable income .			0

@entity10 says the fine and rule is aimed at keeping the birth rate low
policy also includes those who knowingly have a child with a married person
critics say the *prohibitive* fine could lead to more abandoned ' sewer babies '
