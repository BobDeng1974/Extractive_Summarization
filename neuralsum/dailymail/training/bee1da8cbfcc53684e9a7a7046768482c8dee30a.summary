@entity6 , a 37 - year - old taxi - driver from @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , and his wife @entity11 , 31 , first married in 2004			1
but @entity6 - who back then weighed 25st 3lb stone - is so ' embarrassed ' to look at their old wedding photos that he and @entity11 are going to do it all again , in order to generate a brand new family album			1
@entity6 , 37 , and his wife @entity11 , 31 , have lost 11 stone between them since their 2004 wedding , and will now be renewing their vows so as to generate a brand new photo album of their second special day @entity6 has lost over eight stone in just 11 months after realising he needed to take drastic action to tackle his weight when he became physically incapable of playing football with his sons @entity30 and @entity32			1
he embarked upon a healthy eating and lifestyle regime - and @entity11 joined him , managing to lose three stone herself			1
after hitting his target weight , @entity6 proposed to @entity11 for the second time , because he feels ' like a new man ' and is finally confident if front of a camera			1
the couple are planning to renews their vows in @entity43 , at the same church where they wed in 2004			1
embarrassed : @entity6 feels embarrassed when he looks at his wedding pictures from 2004 and ca n't wait to marry his wife as a new man he said : ' when i married @entity11 i was about 24 stone and my suit jacket would n't do up - so i had to have an extra button put in			1
' when i look at our wedding photos now i feel embarrassed			0
so i got down on one knee and proposed to @entity11 again as i thought , " i 'm a new man and i want to do it again "			2
' i look completely different to how i did , and i would like to do my wedding again because i feel like an improved version of myself			0
' we are really excited about renewing our vows			2
i meant them the first time around , but now i am not only going to feel comfortable saying them , but feel comfortable in the suit i am wearing too ! ' second time lucky : @entity6 will meet his wife down the aisle for a second time in a bid to recreate their wedding day now that he has lost 8.5 stone @entity11 said : ' when we first met , @entity6 was quite slim - probably the same weight he is now			1
so when i walk down the aisle again it will be like marrying the man i first met			0
' he has completely changed and become much more confident			0
i am so proud of his achievements			0
' @entity6 used to live on a diet of ready meals , fish and chips and takeaways			1
over the years his waist six ballooned to a staggering 61 inches			0
he said : ' i have always been a big person , even though i have played football all my life			2
' when i left school i worked at a fish and chips shop where i could have a free meal - then i started working at the taxi company			0
' there 's a chippy next door and a @entity91 and kebab shop nearby , so it was easy to grab something - and most of the food at home was from @entity97			0
' i was playing football with my son last year and had to go and get a drink because within minutes i was sweating - he looked so embarrassed in front of his friends			2
' i decided to do something about it and joined @entity106			0
since then , i have lost a lot of weight and feel like a new person			0
' different man : father - of - two @entity6 had ballooned to 25 stone , and he decided to take action when he realised he was too rotund to play football with his eldest son @entity6 's waist size is now down to a trim 36 inches and he has had to buy new clothes from normal shops rather than plus - size catalogues			1
his new diet consists of healthy home - cooked meals and he visits the gym three to four times a week			2
@entity11 , an administrator at a care home , has also lost three stone by eating the same meals as @entity6 in the evening and has gone from a size 20 to a 14			1
she said : ' although i eat healthy food at work i was n't as committed as @entity6 but still managed to lose weight by eating the same dinners as him			2
' when @entity6 proposed i was shocked			2
we both were n't wearing our wedding rings because they were too big after we lost weight			0
' he had taken mine without me knowing and had it made smaller for me			0
i am really looking forward to the day			0
