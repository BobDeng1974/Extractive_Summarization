@entity0 : would your team sign him after he was snubbed by @entity3 ? @entity4 has risked sparking outrage by publicly questioning the conviction of rapist @entity0			1
the @entity8 boss , who admits he was among the three @entity10 managers to support @entity3 in trying to sign @entity0 this week , challenged the unanimous verdict of the jury and the three judges at the @entity14 by saying he thought the 26 - year - old had a strong case to have his conviction overturned			1
@entity0 ’s case has gone to the @entity19			1
but @entity4 delivered his own verdict after @entity3 became the third club to step back from signing a player released from prison after serving half a five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old woman			1
‘ when you look at the evidence , it is there for appeal			2
when you look at the case in detail then @entity0 has a case			1
’ @entity4 made an important mistake in his remarks			1
the @entity0 case is not there for appeal			1
it is up to the @entity19 whether the case is referred to the @entity14 , and so far only three per cent of the 18,753 investigated have been referred			2
@entity4 confirmed he had spoken to @entity3 chairman @entity57 — an old friend — and offered his support to the @entity60 club prior to the chaos that erupted at @entity62 this week			1
‘ @entity57 has looked at the case and evidence and he was of the opinion to give the kid a chance , ’ @entity4 said			1
‘ i ’m a big believer that if you have done your time , you ’ve done your time			2
everyone deserves a second chance			1
’ @entity0 , pictured with girlfriend @entity72 on thursday , is still without a club @entity0 affair has been made even worse by giving in to the mob the @entity0 case could now lead to the introduction of a @entity77 for professional footballers in @entity79			1
@entity80 , the @entity81 chairman , said yesterday he would ‘ encourage the game ’ to look at that option			0
the @entity81 introduced a code for the @entity79 players in 2012 , but a wider code would need approval from @entity10 and @entity89 clubs as well as the @entity90			0
‘ rape and sexual violence are abhorrent and unacceptable , ’ said @entity80			0
‘ this can not be overstated			0
‘ we have reviewed the @entity0 case in detail at the @entity81 and we have examined the legal requirements and our rules and regulations and there is no basis for us to intervene directly			2
‘ that said , it is important we continue to look at the issue of behaviour and attitudes within football , and recognise the unique privileges and responsibilities that come with being a ( player )			0
‘ i would encourage the game to consider and discuss this matter and the prospect for future guidelines or codes of conduct			0
the @entity81 will certainly be considering it			0
’ @entity3 chief executive @entity118 reads out a statement in relation to @entity0 on thursday currently , the @entity81 do not have the legislative powers to intervene but they can push for the introduction of a code , even if the clubs would ultimately remain the moral arbiters			1
the governing body would want any code to focus less on the idea that players are role models but instead that they should recognise that it is a privilege to play professionally and the need to protect the game			0
the @entity90 ’s main concern was to calm the storm created by ill - advised comments from chief executive @entity136			2
in an interview with the @entity138 on thursday @entity136 made the mistake of comparing @entity0 ’s plight to that of the @entity143 families , which sparked calls for him to resign			1
@entity0 was signed by @entity33 for £ 3million back in 2009 and impressed at @entity146 @entity3 boss @entity147 directs his squad during training on thursday , and ( right ) at @entity62 @entity0 was released from prison in october , with his potential return to football sparking widespread debate @entity136 was branded ‘ a disgrace ’ by @entity143 family members , while @entity155 , for the @entity154 , said his comments were ‘ insensitive and crass ’			1
@entity136 apologised on friday but succeeded only in causing further offence and was forced to issue a second apology on the @entity90 website			0
dr @entity161 , primary author of the @entity163 report , said : ‘ @entity136 apologised for any offence he may have caused			0
he then proceeded to compound yesterday ’s crass , insensitive and wholly inappropriate comments by stating that , “ @entity0 is a totally different case but he has the same belief of his innocence ”			2
’ @entity136 , 70 , responded by offering to telephone each family to apologise personally			0
‘ the last thing i intended was to upset anybody connected to the @entity143 tragedy			0
i can only apologise , ’ he said			0
asked if he had considered resigning , @entity136 said : ‘ not all , not while i ’m trying to do my job with the @entity90			0
’ @entity90 chairman @entity136 insists he will not resign over comments relating @entity0 ' case with @entity178 victims ' families			2

@entity3 *announced* on thursday that they wo *n't* be signing @entity0
the convicted rapist was set to sign a two - and - a - half - year deal at the club
@entity8 manager @entity4 says the striker deserves a second chance
