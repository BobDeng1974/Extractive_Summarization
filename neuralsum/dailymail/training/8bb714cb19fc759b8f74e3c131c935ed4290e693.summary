by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 06:20 est , 1 may 2012 the @entity1 has widened its inquiry into ' false ' claims made by @entity4 about the capabilities of its new @entity6 - which is advertised as offering a network @entity10 consumers can not use			1
the regulator said was investigating ‘ potentially problematic ’ claims on @entity4 ’s website about the @entity6 ’s 4g capabilities in the @entity10			1
the @entity10 does not yet have widespread @entity16 coverage , and the @entity6 will be incompatible with it when the first networks arrive			1
the feature is much - hyped by @entity4 as a selling point for the new tablet			0
wall of @entity6 in @entity23 's @entity22 : the @entity10 does not yet have widespread @entity16 coverage , and the @entity6 will be incompatible with it when the first networks arrive			1
the feature is much - hyped by @entity4 as a selling point for the new tablet this @entity16 stands for ‘ fourth generation ’ , a new kind of signal technology used to receive the internet on mobile phones			1
much of the @entity10 already uses @entity31 , but demand for ' on the go ' data means the networks are overloaded			0
what will make @entity36 ? the industry says @entity16 will allow mobile internet to run at the same speed as domestic superfast broadband			0
this will allow users to watch videos more easily on the go , and could provide access to those whose are out of reach of underground broadband cables			0
when will @entity10 get its first @entity16 network ? the firm @entity49 estimates it will be able to put out the first @entity16 signal by the end of this year			1
it yesterday published a report saying that a roll - out of @entity16 would need £ 5.5billion from telecoms companies , but could create up to 125,000 jobs			0
why wo n't it work with @entity4 's @entity6 ? the @entity6 ’s current 4g configuration means it will not be able to connect to @entity10 and @entity61 networks because the frequencies are different to those used in the @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity4 has already offered a refund to all @entity68 buyers of the new tablet - which has a similarly incompatible network - in response to pressure from a consumer watchdog			2
the @entity1 first investigated @entity4 for misleading ’ 4g claims but closed the case informally when the company agreed to change its advertising			1
it was now investigating new complaints from consumers that suggested the problematic claims were still appearing			0
@entity4 has so far declined to comment			0
however the @entity80 reported a source at the company saying that no undertaking was given to remove all references to @entity16 from its site			0
@entity4 ’s @entity10 site still allows consumers to buy a ‘ @entity88 + 4g ’ version of the @entity6 - and @entity6 are still marked as offering @entity16			1
the @entity1 said in a statement : ‘ to confirm , we received 40 complaints about claims for the @entity6 with @entity88 and @entity16 that appeared on @entity95 ’s website			1
' complainants challenged whether the references to @entity16 were misleading , because they understood that @entity16 was not currently available in the @entity10			2
' some of the complainants also challenged the description of the @entity6 as @entity16 because they did not believe that the @entity6 would be compatible with @entity16 networks when they were introduced in the future			2
' ‘ when we approached @entity4 with the concerns that had been raised , it stated it had removed references to @entity16 from the webpage that was subject to the complaints			1
@entity4 ceo @entity106 introduces the new @entity6 during an event in @entity108 , @entity110 regulator said was investigating ¿ potentially problematic ¿ claims on @entity113 s website about the @entity6 ¿ s 4g capabilities in the @entity10 there is no national 4g network in @entity10 - and the planned networks will not even work with @entity4 's machine when they do appear ' @entity4 also agreed to edit a video that contained references to @entity16			1
on the basis that the issues that had been raised with us had been resolved we closed the case informally			0
‘ we have since been contacted by several complainants who have identified other potentially problematic claims about the @entity6 and @entity16 on @entity4 ’s website			1
' we are currently assessing these new complaints			0
if it appears that the problem claims we asked @entity4 to remove are still appearing , will investigate these new complaints			2
’ @entity4 also faced a dispute with @entity68 regulators over the advertising of the @entity6 there			2
the country ’s @entity133 accused the firm of misleading consumers by telling them that the product could connect to a 4g network in @entity68 when that was not the @entity139 offered to refund any @entity6 buyers in @entity68 who felt that they had been misled			0
one model of the tablet claims that it is ' 4g ' - but it will not work with @entity68 4g networks			0
there is no national 4g network in @entity10 - and it 's uncertain whether the planned networks will even work with @entity4 's machine when they do appear			1
the new tablet is labelled as ' @entity16 ' - but the connection wo n't work in many countries including the @entity10 ' all @entity10 ads should avoid containing anything that is likely to mislead , ' says an @entity1 spokesperson			1
' @entity156 states that ads must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information or by presenting it in an unclear , unintelligible or ambiguous way			0
@entity4 will email all @entity68 buyers of its new @entity6 to offer them a refund , a lawyer for the company said today			2
the move came after the nation 's consumer watchdog accused it of misleading advertising over one key aspect of the product			0
the @entity172 has taken legal action to ensure @entity4 makes consumers aware its third - generation @entity6 can not connect to a @entity176 data network in @entity68 due to technical incompatibility			2
passers - by look at @entity4 's new ipad in a window display at an @entity182 in @entity183			0
the company has now said it will issue a refund to all buyers			0
