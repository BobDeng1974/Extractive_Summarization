while manager @entity3 wound down after a crushing @entity5 quarter - final defeat to soft soul on his favourite radio station , his @entity1 team flushed the defeat out of their system with a trip to the go - karting track			1
very different approaches but both seemed to have the desired effect of melting away the disappointment			2
a narrow victory over @entity17 may have lacked petrol fuelled highs or many thrills of any description , but it lifted @entity1 to 13th in the table , consigning two defeats to local rivals @entity24 within a week to distant memory			1
@entity3 ' @entity1 squad went on a go - karting trip after their @entity5 quarter - final defeat @entity29 ( right ) said the midweek trip was kept under wraps for fear of sending out the wrong message ' i let them have a couple of days away from me , ' said @entity3 about the aftermath of a 2 - 0 defeat which ended in a pitch invasion and @entity5 probe into seats being thrown by @entity1 supporters , ' i was obviously bitterly disappointed myself and i can be a bit snappy at times			1
so i took myself away from the firing line			0
' you either have a passion or you do n't and sometimes i get myself in such a state i am best away from people			0
' despite saturday 's win — thanks to @entity51 's headed goal — taking @entity1 11 points clear of the relegation zone @entity3 said his aims were unchanged			1
' i still want 40 points , ' he said			2
' i 'm not concerned about what others do , i would be in my grave by now if i sat worrying about every goal that goes in			0
i listen to @entity61 and a bit of music rather than worry about what other people are doing			0
' @entity1 beat @entity17 at the @entity66 on saturday thanks to @entity51 's headed goal @entity29 said the midweek go - karting trip was kept under wraps for fear of sending out the wrong message to fans			1
' we did n't want to show the world we doing it and we did n't want the fans to see us trying to do stuff like that straight after losing to @entity24			1
we gave ourselves a little lift , it was just for us as the lads			0
they were down , it was hard to lose two games to @entity24 , especially the @entity5 game			1
i think it worked quite well so maybe we 'll go karting again next week			2
' @entity29 , 31 , is enjoying a resurgence at @entity66 after joining on a free transfer in january from @entity88 , where his later years were blighted by a struggle with ulcerative colitis			2
he bossed the midfield against @entity17 but claimed he rolled over on the racing track			0
' in the interests of team spirit , i let the rest of the lads win , ' he joked , ' the top three were @entity98 , [ @entity100 ] @entity99 and [ @entity102 ] @entity101 , they were saying the @entity105 lads did the business			0
gards organised it and he definitely had the fastest car			0

@entity1 had a midweek go - karting *session* after @entity24 *dumped* them out of the @entity5
@entity29 said it was kept under wraps by the squad
@entity3 still wants to reach the magic 40 - point mark
