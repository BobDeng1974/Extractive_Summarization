by @entity0 have you seen @entity4 's video / single , @entity2 ? it is one of the most unintentionally comical things i have seen in a long while			1
it 's all rather steamy , but in the most absurdly contrived way imaginable			1
i mean , honestly : who works out in @entity12 ? and balance balls have many uses , but i 've never seen them as sex aids			1
time efficient way to get fit : @entity0 has discovered hiit the title probably tells you all you need to know			1
it 's about sex as exercise , you see			1
or perhaps it 's the other way round			2
either way , there 's a lot of pert bottoms			2
the director , @entity27 , has expressed his intention to ' take the viewer on a voyeuristic journey ' that he hopes ' will no doubt see gym memberships soar '			1
really ? if there 's one thing guaranteed to make me never set foot in a gym ever again it 's the prospect of being surrounded by nubile @entity38 writhing around on yoga mats			1
but the good news is that for , shall we say , rather exercise - averse ladies like me , it 's perfectly possible to get fit without going anywhere near a gym			1
you just need to get into high intensity interval training			2
no more slogging it out for endless boring hours on the treadmill			2
high intensity interval training ( aka @entity53 ) is the modern way to keep fit , a flexible , versatile method of exercise that need n't cost a penny and that pretty much anyone can do			1
@entity59 : @entity4 looks nimble on an exercise ball in her new video and it 's got even me , lazy - pants extraordinaire , hooked			1
essentially , it 's all about short , sharp bursts of intense exercise , alternated with rest ( i do so love a rest , do n't you ? )			1
it 's ideal for the time - pressed - or for those who are easily bored by physical jerks			1
best of all , you can do it anywhere : in the park , your garden , you can even incorporate it into your daily commute - for example , running hell for leather up the stairs at work a few times a day or getting off the bus a couple of stops earlier and walking as fast as you can			1
cycling , running , skipping , swimming - all can be adapted to @entity53 , and it does n't require any equipment			1
the key thing is to push yourself to the absolute limit , for short bursts of time , then have a nice long sitdown			2
the roots of this approach lie with dr @entity95 , whose work with the @entity99 @entity98 speed - skating team in the @entity100 led him to conclude that short bursts of very high intensity activity produced better results than long hours of more moderate training			1
but it was n't until relatively recently that these principles began to catch on			2
so , why am i recommending it so heartily for sloths like me ? well , i 'm rather unnerved by the sudden approach of springtime and the dreaded day when i have to ditch the tights and show my bare legs			2
and @entity53 works fast , fast enough to assassinate any winter chub			1
studies have shown that 30 - second bike sprints for a total of three minutes led to the same changes in muscle cells as two hours of long , steady bike riding			1
essentially , it 's about taking the body by surprise			2
the human body is annoyingly adaptable , constantly re-calibrating itself depending on your level of activity and eking out energy levels to meet demand			2
but if you really want to burn fat , you need to run your metabolism ragged by constantly shifting the goal posts			2
that way it will use up more energy responding to demand - rather like over-revving an engine			1
not all experts concur on how long the energy bursts should be			2
professor @entity142 at @entity143 , for example , advocates a three - minute approach , 20 seconds flat - out of , say , sprinting , followed by a two - minute recovery of walking , repeated three times			1
at the start i used to run up and down the stairs at home , but i had to stop when the dog started chasing after me			2
now i find a park bench does the trick for step - ups and tricep dips			1
i 'm also told that star jumps are brilliant - though after two children they 're slightly off the agenda			1
i 've also taken to skipping with a rope , really fast			2
it might sound rather simple and a bit silly			2
but it 's really not			2
the researchers at @entity143 found that @entity53 improves insulin sensitivity , important for stabilising blood sugar			1
in this respect it 's ideal for us middle - aged fatties , as it helps kick - start the metabolism			1
that said , do check with your doctor before you embark on @entity53 , and i 'd suggest starting off in the care of a qualified personal trainer who can make sure you do n't end up in @entity180			1
when i first did it , i got carried away and pulled a muscle			0
the person who taught me was @entity184 of @entity185 ( freedom2train.com ) and he has some excellent ( and free ) online tips at @entity187			0
@entity188 , the man who got everyone hooked on the 5:2 diet , recently published a book about @entity53 called @entity192			1
there 's even an app called seven ( @entity195 ) that puts you through your paces with a chair and your own body weight - and not a @entity4 in sight			1
secret weapon : @entity202 bronzer is the most abused and misused item in the beauty cupboard			0
and yet , done properly , it 's also one of the most effective			0
as the weather slowly improves and our thoughts turn to balmy evenings with the odd glass of rosé , the temptation to fake a glow can seem irresistible			0
sadly , the result is all too often less than successful			0
i know , because i 've been there			0
back in the @entity219 , when shoulder pads and batwings were all the rage , i happily tripped about the place looking an alarming shade of brick			0
@entity226 was the thing back then , a russet - coloured powder that made the wearer look as if they 'd fallen asleep face - first on a clay tennis court			1
modern bronzers are a much less risky prospect			0
they come very finely milled for a super-sheer finish and , provided you know what you are doing , can impart instant fabulousness , in a just - stepped - off - a - yacht sort of a way			1
crush ... @entity243 embroidered lipstick cosmetic pouch ( £ 30 , johnlewiscom ) , pictured above			0
most make - up bags are hideous or hideously expensive			1
adorable , practical and original			0
everything a make - up bag should be			1
. the cougar cheek lift , £ 750			0
involves injecting fillers into the temples			0
yes , ladies , apparently our temples can betray our age			0
i 'm not even going to tell you where you can get it done			0
it 's all about light and shade , you see			0
light on the bits of your face where the sun might fall : forehead , temples , tops of the cheekbones , the bridge of the nose			0
and shade , well , everywhere else : the hollows of your cheeks , under the chin , sides of the nose			0
the best come in two shades			0
@entity285 's @entity284 ( £ 49 , charlotte tilbury.com ) , above , occupies pride of place on my dressing table , and with good reason			0
it makes achieving that contoured @entity292 look possible even for an old boiler like me , whose contours are far from sharp these days			0
i start by applying the darker shade underneath my cheekbones and chin , and blending			0
the result is a very subtle contouring effect , which works particularly well on my jawline			0
the highlighter goes anywhere else it 's needed , including the decolletage			0
it 's an investment piece , though			0
if you want a budget alternative , @entity308 's @entity307 ( £ 11 ) is an excellent choice			0
the quality of this is quite hard to believe at the price			0
not a hint of orange , and it works well for most skin tones , warming up a grey winter complexion			0
you can use it on the eyes , too , for a lovely natural look			0
it even has its own mirror .			0
