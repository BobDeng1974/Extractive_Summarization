we were told he was doing really well			0
' then all of a sudden he went downhill			0
the doctors told me there was nothing more they could do and i just held him until he died in my arms			1
' a doctor rang us up after he died and told us that he would still be here if he had not got the infection , and they did n't expect it at all			2
' it has been a major shock - i am heartbroken			0
' ms @entity19 was rushed to @entity10 on august 17 after she experienced labour pains just 24 weeks into her pregnancy			1

' a few days later they received a phone call from a doctor who told them that @entity6 had died from a blood infection			1
@entity117 is a common bacteria which can cause disease in many animals , including humans			0
it is most commonly found in soil and groundwater and is most dangerous to people with weakened immune systems , such as cancer patients and premature babies			2
it lives on the skin but can spread through medical equipment such as catheters and feeding tubes inserted into the body			0
the main symptoms include inflammation and sepsis and if it infects the body 's main organs , such as the lungs and kidneys , it can lead to death			0
it does not usually cause illness in healthy people			0

he was a right little pickle and a little rascal			0
' the couple were only officially informed that @entity6 had died of the bacteria just minutes before the hospital released a statement yesterday			1
they have now instructed lawyers to begin legal proceedings for compensation and are due to meet hospital staff			0

' dr @entity179 said other babies at the unit had been tested and 12 were found to have pseudomonas bacteria on the skin			1
' on its own this does not cause illness or require treatment but presents a risk if bacteria gets into the blood stream , ' he said			0
' one baby has had treatment for a minor infection but the others remain well and eight have been discharged home			1
' three babies with the bacteria on their skin remain in the unit but are being treated in isolation			1
' the trust said pseudomonas bacteria has been found in the water supply in the neonatal intensive care unit			1
' this is the most common source when similar events have happened in other units , ' dr @entity179 said			0
' to minimise the risk to patients , strict infection control measures have been instituted for staff , parents and visitors			0
' babies are washed in sterile water and the tap water is being filtered to ensure that any pseudomonas bacteria is removed			1
' other measures that have been adopted include more regular testing and enhanced cleaning regimes			0
' whilst these measures have reduced the risk to babies , the hospital estates team are reviewing the water supply and considering other work that could be done to reduce the risk of pseudomonas			1
' dr @entity179 said that parents of babies in the unit had been given information about the infection			2
he also said admissions to the unit had currently been reduced			0

killer : @entity6 died after an outbreak of the water - borne bacteria pseudomonas , pictured , in the baby intensive care unit ' @entity117 is commonly found in soil and groundwater and it is a recognised healthcare associated infection that affects people with weakened immune systems			1
' the people most at risk are those with depleted immune systems such as cancer patients , people with severe burns and premature babies in neonatal units			0
' the bacteria can be spread by contaminated water , inhalation of aerosols , touching contaminated surfaces or person - to - person through poor hand hygiene			2
' the @entity257 has provided advice to the trust on measures to reduce the risk to other babies in the unit and we will continue to work with the trust to monitor the situation until confident that the risk has been minimised			0
' the infection can be treated effectively with antibiotics , especially if treatment is started immediately after confirming the diagnosis			0
' @entity117 lives on the skin but can spread through medical equipment such as catheters and feeding tubes inserted into the body			0
