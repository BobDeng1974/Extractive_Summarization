by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 09:38 est , 28 august 2012 a medical student has become the youngest @entity3 woman to conquer @entity4 despite suffering a life - threatening stroke on her first attempt - at 20,000 feet			1
@entity7 was too high to be airlifted and had to be carried 4,000 feet down the mountain by a sherpa after being left paralysed by the stroke in may last year			1
but after recovering from the near fatal drama she made a second successful attempt despite doctors warnings it could happen again - and be much worse			1
she did it ! @entity7 , left , pictured at the summit of @entity4 which she described as ' overwhelming ' back home in @entity18 , @entity19 , miss @entity7 , now 20 , said : ' reaching the summit was overwhelming			1
i did n’t dare to think i would actually make it to the top after what happened first time			2
' on the day of the stroke , i ’d felt well during the day but it had been a long hike and we ’d been carrying a heavy load to camp			2
determined : @entity7 is pictured during her successful attempt this year which she managed despite doctors warning her of the risks of a second stroke ' we were just 9,000 feet from the summit and i was looking forward to the final push			1
i went to bed that night exhausted			2
' i woke up in the middle of the night feeling pins and needles spreading from my torso to my limbs and face			2
' i patted around inside my sleeping back looking for my left arm but could n’t find it			1
dead arms are common at altitude because blood circulation is more difficult so at first i thought i ’d been lying in an awkward position			2
' i sat up and tried moving around but the feeling was simply getting worse			2
that ’s when i realised from my medical studies i was in a serious situation			2
' she added : ' i was very scared at first			2
but then when i realised we were too high for the helicopter to reach us i felt at peace			2
' i resigned myself to the fact i would n’t make it - i accepted i was as good as dead			2
i ’ve never been one to get stressed in life			2
i could n’t see the use of panicking			0
' but fellow climber @entity61 , who was sharing @entity7 ’s tent , raised the alarm after he asked miss @entity7 what was wrong and realised she could n’t speak			1
he headed out into temperatures of minus 25 degrees celsius to find help			0
mr @entity61 , 30 , of @entity68 , said : ' at first i thought she was just very cold			0
by the time i woke up , half of her body was outside her sleeping bag			0
' i realised things were very bad when i tried to put a glove on her left hand and it was completely limp			1
i knew if she stayed where she was , she was going to die			0
' miss @entity7 struggled to her feet and a sherpa helped carry her just over a kilometre further down the mountain where a helicopter picked her up			1
on the way down she faced sheer drops and was required to use unstable ladders to cross plunging crevasses			0
paralysed : @entity7 is pictured waiting for the helicopter to rescue her following her stroke just 9,000 feet from the top last year			1
she could n't feel the left side of her body and her left side is still weaker than her right she said : ' as we crossed the ladders i could n’t place my legs too well , and i could n’t grip supporting ropes with my left hand			1
beneath me were 40 - metre drops into darkness			0
i could n’t hold on properly , which was frightening			0
' she was flown to the nearest hospital in @entity106 , the capital of @entity107 , where doctors scanned her body before declaring her fit to fly home a week later			1
back in the @entity3 doctors prescribed medication to thin her blood			1
initially she was told she had suffered a cerebral oedema - a swelling of the brain commonly seen in climbers at extreme altitudes			0
@entity7 was too high to be airlifted and had to be carried 4,000 feet down the mountain by a sherpa after being left paralysed by the stroke			1
she is pictured being stretchered on to a helicopter which flew her to hospital ' my symptoms did n’t fit			0
i wanted to believe i had suffered a simple migraine and that i could go back to the mountain straight away , but i learned that was n’t going to happen			1
' eventually dr @entity130 , a top neurologist , confirmed that @entity7 had suffered a vasospasmic event in her brain			1
blood vessels had spasmed , restricting circulation which led to paralysis			0
' i had suffered a transient ischaemic attack - a mini-stroke			0
had i stayed at altitude , i would have died			0
recovery : after the stroke she rested for several months and before trying again , determined to fulfill her ambitions ' an mri scan showed there had n’t been any permanent damage , but i was warned that if i went back up i could suffer a major attack which would leave me in a wheelchair for the rest of my life			1
' miss @entity7 was ordered to rest for several months			1
she tried swimming to regain strength in the left side of her body , which despite the hopeful prognosis , is still partially paralysed today			1
' i went for a lot of testing and i still have a significantly weaker left side			1
it ’s probably as strong now as it ’s ever going to get			0
but it ’s annoying rather than debilitating			0
' she had dreamed of scaling @entity4 since she saw the peak for the first time during a @entity163 expedition to @entity107 when she was 17			0
shortly before her ill - fated first attempt at climbing @entity4 last may , she had entered the record books as the youngest female climber ever to scale @entity167 , a deadly peak in the shadow of the world ’s tallest mountain			1
she was determined to fulfill her ambitions to scale @entity4 and , unknown to doctors and her parents , she arranged the return trip almost immediately after flying back to the @entity3			1
' to have a stroke at my age is very rare			0
doctors warned me that if i tried to climb the mountain again it could result in permanent paralysis , or worse			1
but their advice was n’t going to stop me			0
' her family , including terrified mother @entity185 , 59 , father @entity186 , 55 , and sister @entity187 , 19 , begged her not to make a second attempt , but she was determined			1
in april , @entity7 began her second attempt , aided by a doctor travelling as part of the expedition			1
' i was jumping at every little ache and pain , and you get plenty of those on the way up			0
i knew if it happened again , even if i survived , i would never be able to climb again			0
' on may 19th this year , aged 20 , she became the youngest @entity3 female climber ever to reach the summit of @entity4 - a record broken by friend @entity204 , 19 , just 24 hours later			1
sisters : @entity7 , left , at home with sister @entity187			1
she said as she started to reach the summit she started hallucinating and she imagined there was a party waiting for her with music and people dancing ' @entity212 caused me to hallucinate and i imagined there was a party waiting for me at the summit , with music and people dancing			2
we stayed at the top for ten minutes before starting the descent			0
' i did n’t want to believe doctors who had told me not to go back , but i could n’t put their warnings out of my mind			1
it was amazing that i ’d got there			0
' many doubted me , which was understandable			0
it was a crazy thing to do			0
i did it , and it ’s an amazing feeling			0
' now miss @entity7 is putting her mountain climbing career on hold to concentrate on her medical training at the @entity235 , where she is entering her second year			1
' i had made sacrifices to conquer @entity4			0
i missed exams , and i am still working to catch up			0
but i do n’t see that i made a mistake by returning to the mountain			2
' in the long term , my medical practice will be more informed by my experiences			0
i have come to realise there is a lot of strength in everybody			0
until you are in a position where your body is dying , you do n’t know the strength you have			0
' when you ’re on the very extremity of life , you can be surprised at how much fight is left in you			2

@entity7 had to be carried 4,000 feet down the mountain by a sherpa after being left paralysed just 9,000 feet from the summit
after months spent recovering and despite warnings from doctors not to attempt it again , she did and reached the summit
