by @entity0 published : 03:52 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 09:36 est , 17 september 2012 a mother feared her toddler could go blind in one eye after he bit into a liquid laundry capsule , causing detergent to squirt in his face			1
@entity7 believes that her 22 - month - old son @entity8 had mistaken the pink @entity9 for a sweet			1
it is the latest in a string of cases in which young children have been injured after putting detergent capsules , which are used in dishwashers and washing machines , into their mouths			1
agony : @entity19 screamed as his right eye swelled shut after he bit into a liquid laundry capsule the brightly coloured capsules , known as ' liquitabs ' cause an immediate chemical burn , resulting in breathing problems as the airway swells			1
the consequences can be fatal without medical attention			0
one hospital in @entity31 has already seen five cases this year , and today the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) called on manufacturers to redesign the packaging of the capsules to deter children from playing with them			1
ms @entity38 , 30 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , described how @entity8 screamed as his eye swelled shut and the chemicals inside the capsule also got into his mouth and on his stomach			1
' i heard him scream , ' she told the @entity47 ' the chemicals were burning him			0
i was terrified he would n't be able to see properly			0
' @entity8 was kept in hospital for four days and put on a drip			1
he is due to go back to hospital today for a check - up , but doctors do not believe that he suffered any internal damage			1
medics will monitor the child 's sight every three months			0
the scare has prompted ms @entity58 to warn other parents of the dangers of leaving liquid laundry capsules where children can find them			1
she said : ' i want to warn parents to keep the capsules locked away in a cupboard			1
we had left ours on the side and somehow @entity8 managed to climb up			0
injured : @entity8 is recovering well ( left ) after he was kept in hospital for four days ( right ) and put on a drip , but doctors will monitor his sight every three months ' the capsules come in a child - proof plastic box , but @entity8 still got into it			1
' the @entity78 recorded 647 reports of injury involving detergent capsules last year			1
some 850million capsules are sold in the @entity83 each year			1
@entity84 , public health adviser at the @entity33 , said : ' the safe storage of all household chemicals and medicines is absolutely crucial so we encourage families to keep items like laundry detergents in a lockable cupboard			1
fear : @entity7 believes that her 22 - month - old son @entity8 had mistaken the pink @entity9 for a sweet ' in addition to children accidentally squirting detergent in their eyes , doctors have also recently raised awareness of the risk of children ingesting detergent – accidents that have reportedly caused near - fatal injuries			1
' given the seriousness of some of the injuries already caused , it is perhaps time for the industry to look again at the way these products are packaged			0
' so often they are brightly coloured and very tactile – and must be quite attractive to young children , who may mistake them for sweets or toys			2
' @entity8 's case came to light less than a fortnight after it emerged that five children under the age of two have been admitted to the @entity123 in @entity124 this year after possibly thinking they were jelly sweets			1
doctors called for childproof packaging for the products and advised parents to take a child to their nearest @entity132 unit as soon as possible if it is suspected they have swallowed something poisonous			2
dr @entity135 , from the hospital 's ear , nose and throat department , said : ' we have known for some time about the risk of eye injuries from kids squeezing these liquitabs until they burst			2
' what we have seen more recently is that children are biting into the tablets , presumably because they think they are sweets as they have the same soft texture and bright colouring			2
' the alkaline chemicals in the liquitab cause an immediate chemical burn , causing breathing problems as the airway starts to swell rapidly			2
getting them to hospital straight away is imperative			0
' in most of the cases seen so far , we have had to insert a breathing tube to protect the child 's airway from the swelling and help them breathe			0
' if these children had n't reached @entity132 on time , the airway could close over completely with potentially fatal consequences			2
' once the breathing tube is inserted , children can be on a ventilator for as long as two weeks until the swelling settles			2
one child admitted to the hospital required further surgery to repair the damage caused by the capsule			0
dr @entity135 said : ' it really is only good fortune that we have n't seen a death resulting from this type of injury			0
@entity183 methylpropional : a synthetic fragrance that is also used in a number of beauty products			0
it is considered safe only within recommended use of @entity189 , it is a skin irritant and there have been tests that found that skin applications at high concentrations in animals caused sperm damage			0
alpha - isomethyl @entity196 : banned by the @entity198 ( @entity198 ) from being mixed into fragrance products , such as perfume and cologne , it has been found to irritate the skin and trigger allergic reactions in some people			2
however , it is still found in detergents and other cosmetics that are not classed as a ' fragrance '			0
@entity210 , @entity209 , @entity211 : severe allergens that be listed on the label because they are severe allergens			0
higher concentrations can even cause central nervous system disruption ( thus their use in certain pesticides ) and skin , eye and respiratory tract irritation			2
these chemicals can also trigger asthma attacks			0
' it is important parents realise that these liquid capsules are dangerous chemicals and they should be kept locked away so children ca n't reach them			1
they must be stored safely at all times , out of reach and sight of young children			2
' wherever possible and , as with all household cleaning products and bleaches , they should be stored in a locked cupboard or in a cupboard that can not be accessed by children			2
' dr @entity135 and his colleagues have published a letter in the medical journal @entity243 to alert medics and parents to the danger			0
earlier this month , concerned mother @entity247 revealed how her seven - month - old daughter spent 10 days in hospital and was treated in intensive care after eating the contents of a tablet			1
' @entity253 was at my sister 's house playing with my two - year - old nephew who managed to get hold of one of these liquitabs , ' ms @entity247 said			1
' he thought it was a sweetie because it was bright and like a jelly , so he gave it to @entity253 who bit into it			2
' immediately we realised there was a problem as she was going in and out of consciousness , so phoned an ambulance right away			0
i 'm just so lucky to still have my little girl			0
' now i make sure that all the liquitabs are locked away and i tell everyone to do the same			0
' the boxes they come in really should be child - proof and i hope manufacturers do something about this as i would n't want this to happen to any other little girl or boy			1
' @entity286 , director general of the @entity287 , said that manufacturers were taking steps to make their products safer			0
' companies are introducing child - frustrating closures , there have always been safe - use icons , and where companies have packaged the capsules in clear boxes we are increasingly seeing that those boxes are milky or opaque so children can not see what is inside , ' he added			1
' the simplest way to reduce the number of incidents to zero would be for parents to keep the capsules out of the reach of children			1
' warning : @entity8 was injured after he bit into a pink @entity9 which he had apparently mistaken for a sweet a spokesman for @entity312 , the company which makes vanish products , said : ' when developing our products we are also always looking for formats which are effective , practical , convenient , but above all safe for consumers			1
' the safety and quality of all our vanish products is always our primary objective			0
' this includes clear user instructions on the pack which should always be followed			0
' as with all household cleaning products these include clear instructions that products of this type should be stored safely and kept away from small children			0
' in the case of @entity332 this warning is clearly on the lid and the box has been designed to make it difficult for children to open			1
' we are unaware of the details of this particular case as we have not heard directly from the family			0
' however , we take it very seriously and will urgently look into the case			0
