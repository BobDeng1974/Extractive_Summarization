@entity0 was @entity2 ’s match - winner with his first goal for the club on what was his full @entity7 debut			1
but who is rookie @entity9 ? @entity10 brings you more … where did he come from ? @entity0 celebrates scoring the winner for @entity2 against @entity15 on his first start for the club @entity2 moved quickly to beat off interest from a host of @entity21 clubs and signed the 21 - year - old from @entity23 for £ 1.5m in june			1
why was there so much interest ? well , 16 goals in @entity21 ’s second tier alerted the @entity28 and many others but the player preferred to test himself in the @entity7			2
he left @entity31 and headed straight back to his homeland for an awards ceremony , where he is up for the best breakthrough player prize for last season			0
he has also now broken into @entity21 ’s under - 21 side			1
how has he done at @entity2 ? after seven substitute appearances he had yet to break his duck before his headed winner at @entity15			1
he did , however , score a sublime solo effort for the under - 21s , weaving his way between four defenders before slotting home			2
striker @entity0 , 21 , signed in june from @entity21 club @entity23 , scoring 16 goals in the @entity21 second tier and that won him a start ? not really , although it did put him to the front of the queue should @entity50 have got injured			1
and that is exactly what happened , the @entity57 striker failing a fitness test just two hours before the game			2
@entity60 must have been delighted with him ? he was , and here ’s what he said : ‘ he ’s a really great individual talent			1
he has n’t quite got the strength and power that you associate with the @entity7 but that will come to him			0
he has worked really , really hard			0
the players love him so they were really made up that he scored the winner			2
’ does he speak any @entity71 then ? @entity10 tried to grab a few words with him outside of the ground , and this is what we got			0
‘ i am very happy			0
i hope i can play good for @entity2 and score many goals			0
’ the @entity2 will certainly be hoping he is good to his word .			0

@entity0 *rewarded* @entity60 for starting him with a winning goal
the 21 - year - old striker signed from @entity23 for £ 1.5m in june
he had made seven substitute appearances before starting against @entity15
