by @entity0 for @entity1 bones of large animals discovered in south - west @entity4 , suggest that @entity5 were more sophisticated at hunting and gathering than previously thought			1
our ancient cousins may have butchered the bodies of animals such as mammoths and bison , only carrying the meatiest cuts back to their caves			1
@entity4 archaeologists came to this conclusion because long bones were missing from the carcasses of many of the animals found at the @entity23 site in @entity24			1
neanderthals may have butchered the bodies of animals such as mammoths and horses so they only carried the meatiest parts back to their dwellings to eat			1
@entity4 archaeologists based their idea on bones discovered at the @entity23 site in @entity24 , including this section of an ancient horses ' spine neanderthals lived at the site between 35,000 and 55,000 years ago			1
archaeologists from @entity38 ( @entity39 ) in @entity40 discovered the bones of mammoths , woolly rhinoceros , horse , bison and reindeer when land was being cleared for the new @entity49 road			1
the prehistoric site on a hill would have overlooked the ancient bed of the @entity53 and has yielded ‘ a rich faunal assemblage ’ spread throughout three levels including flaked flint objects made by @entity5			2
archaeologists from @entity39 said that most of the bones belonged to animals that lived in a cold climate and were herbivores			1
archaeologists from @entity38 ( @entity38 ) in @entity40 discovered the bones of mammoths , woolly rhinoceros , horse ( pictured right ) , bison and reindeer as land was being cleared for a new road – the @entity49			1
they also found the skull of a cave bear ( pictured left ) bones of large animals discovered in south western @entity4 , suggest that @entity5 were more sophisticated at hunting and gathering than previously thought			1
it is already known that @entity5 used tools to scrape carcasses clean ( illustrated ) and sometimes cooked meat before eating it they also found the skull of a cave bear and a several wolf bones			1
the experts think that all the bones belong to animals that were deliberately hunted or scavenged by @entity5 who used the carcasses			2
some of the bones have cutting marks , showing they were butchered			0
the archaeologists noted a ‘ lack of long bones , ’ which they believe shows that only the meat - rich parts of the bodies were carried back to the @entity5 ' homes			1
they think the poorly - preserved site might have been a carcass processing area			0
it is hoped that the site will reveal more about the behaviour of @entity5 away from hunting camps and dwellings so that experts learn more about their hunting techniques			2
toasted pigeon was a favourite dish of @entity5 , who unlike their brutish reputation , had the brains and skill to catch the birds			0
the discovery was announced earlier this month after an excavation of @entity115 where @entity5 are thought to have lived nearly 100,000 years ago			2
archaeologists unearthed leftovers of @entity5 feasts , which included pigeon bone , in sediments that built up between 28,000 and 67,000 years ago on the east face of @entity122			2
researchers believe the @entity5 hunted wild pigeons , possibly by climbing steep cliffs to reach raid their nests			0
so far , 150 ancient bird species have been identified from bones found in the cave sediments			2
many were of rock doves , the ancestors of modern feral pigeons			0
twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools and 15 had tooth marks			0
some also had signs of charring , which may have been created when the meat cooked on an open fire			0
they liked what we like and went for the breasts , the drumsticks and the wings , ' study author @entity142 , director of the @entity143 , told journalists of the bone analysis			0
' they had the knowledge and technology to do this			0
' professor @entity142 said the bone analysis added to a growing body of evidence that @entity5 were more sophisticated than was once widely believed			0
' this makes them even more human , ' he said			0
' in june , researchers at @entity161 reported evidence from 50,000 - year - old @entity5 poo that those living in southern @entity165 also ate nuts and vegetables			0
other researchers recently found plant microfossils trapped in @entity5 teeth - a finding that suggests the species may have led a more complex lifestyle , harvesting and cooking a variety of plants in addition to hunting prey			2
archaeologists from @entity38 ( @entity39 ) discovered the bones as land was being cleared for a new road – the @entity49 in @entity24 ( circled on the map ) the experts think that all the bones they discovered belong to animals that were deliberately hunted or scavenged by @entity5 who used the carcasses			1
a horse 's jawbone is pictured			0

animal bones were found at a @entity23 site in @entity24 , @entity4
they belong to mammoths , woolly rhinoceros , horse , bison and reindeer
the bones are between *33,000* and 55,000 years old
archaeologists from @entity39 believe @entity5 may have butchered large herbivores , only carrying the meatiest parts back to their homes
this because ' long bones ' were not found with carcasses
