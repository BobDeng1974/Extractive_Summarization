the government chief whip @entity24 informed all 303 @entity25 @entity6 in a note last month that there will be no major legislation on thursdays for the foreseeable future			1
it means the politicians , who are paid £ 67,060 a year , are now expected to attend @entity9 for just two - and - a - half days from 2.30pm on mondays to the end of business on wednesdays			1
thursdays will be treated as a one - line whip , meaning attendance is not required			0
departmental questions and backbench debates will continue to be held in the @entity39 , but few are expected to stay behind			2
with no crunch votes to stay for , @entity2 and @entity18 @entity6 are also likely to return home to campaign for votes ahead of next year ’s election			1
@entity45 , @entity2 mp for @entity46 , accused the @entity20 of creating ‘ part - time mps ’			0
he said : ‘ the government is nervous about the election			2
what they are trying to do is give their mps time off to fight off the electoral challenge			0
it is to encourage part - time mps out electioneering			0

’ @entity1 , @entity2 ’s shadow deputy leader of the @entity3 , said : ‘ this is a zombie government completely out of ideas			1
they are doing the parliamentary equivalent of twiddling their thumbs			0
’ two - day week : from this week , mps will be allowed to leave @entity11 to begin their weekend as early as wednesday afternoons because of a lack of legislation to pass			1
above , the @entity11 @entity69 , @entity25 mp for @entity70 , described it as a ‘ farcical situation ’			0
he said : ‘ we need a general election , but we can not have one			0
so we ’re going to have to go through another six months of this charade of @entity20			0
‘ the @entity18 are basically trying to ride two horses at the same time – one being part of government and the other being against the government			1
it makes for a farcical situation and it is no way to govern			0
’ prime minister @entity83 agreed to introduce the fixed - term @entity84 in a deal with deputy prime minister @entity86			0
the commitment – which was enacted in september 2011 – was supposed to guarantee stability following the formation of the @entity20			0
critics say that the five - year term is too long and has led to the impasse , but a backbench attempt to repeal the act was rejected earlier this year			2
sir @entity95 , @entity25 mp for @entity96 , said the legislation was ‘ a hash job ’ and ‘ never thought through properly ’			2

a @entity25 spokesman said : ‘ as advice to conservative mps made clear , if there is a three line whip then @entity6 will be required to be in @entity9 , as has always been the case			1
and just as has always been the case , if there is not a three line whip , they are free to choose whether to work in their constituencies instead			0
