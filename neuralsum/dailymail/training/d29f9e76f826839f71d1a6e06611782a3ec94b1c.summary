@entity0 has revealed he wants his @entity2 team to play in the same style as sunday 's opponents @entity4 as he once again prepared to be without a raft of players this weekend			1
@entity2 boss @entity7 said this afternoon he will be without nine first team players for the visit of @entity11 's side from @entity12 and revealed that central defender @entity13 will be selected once again after his debut against @entity15 last week			1
but the @entity16 continues his quest for following football and believes @entity4 and their @entity20 coach are a fitting template			1
it shall be a very interesting game			2
' i know @entity2 lost to them twice last year so they 're a difficult opponent			2
' i hope we can dominate the game but they want to dominate the game also			2
they are more allowed to play on the counter than we are so that 's also the difficulty			0
' @entity7 will be hoping his car trouble is n't a bad omen for him ahead of @entity2 's clash with @entity4 this weekend			1
the @entity65 boss suffered a flat tyre while out and about driving and signing autographs on thursday			0
@entity2 have several players back in training but @entity7 has revealed that players like @entity71 are not yet ready for 90 minutes			1
' it 's difficult to explain but you can be fit but not match fit , that 's the big difference , ' he added			0
@entity7 has been implimenting some tough training sessions at @entity76 , but says he wants his team to play ' the @entity4 way ' @entity7 says @entity13 will play again on sunday as @entity2 still have three central defenders injured @entity7 was in good spirits ahead of his latest @entity46 encounter and will look to add to his two home @entity46 victories @entity4 have only won one game this season and are coming off the back of a tricky @entity88 fixture against @entity89 in @entity90 on thursday @entity91 will miss the game this sunday after being sent off against @entity15 after he needlessly hacked @entity93 ' so , for example , @entity94 is fit but he ca n't play because of his rib fracture			1
but he can not play			0
so , for example @entity71 has trained one week but he 's not fit to play 90 minutes			0
' we have eight injuries and one red card so nine players are not available to play			2
' i believe we still have three central defenders injured so @entity13 shall play			1
he 's the only player that can play in that right central defender position			0
i have chosen him last week			0
' for a player like him it 's very difficult to maintain that level			0
that is his biggest challenge			0
' @entity7 also revealed that he has spoken to executive vice-chairman @entity112 about playing midweek exhibition games and has given the go - ahead			1
@entity115 ( left ) and @entity116 ( right ) will be looking to build on their striking partnership this weekend @entity0 says he has spoken to @entity112 about midweek friendlies and has given the club the go ahead he said : ' i agree with that			1
' we have spoken last week with each other and @entity112 so i fully agree			1
' i 'm used to playing midweeks but i have said in the first three months we have to wait because it 's difficult enough for the players to adapt and adjust to the new play organisation and style and they shall honour that also but we shall play midweeks			2
' it 's good because i like to play games against high level opponents			0

@entity0 says he wants @entity2 to play the @entity4 way this weekend at @entity138
two sides meet on sunday with both looking for a *crucial* @entity46 victory
@entity7 admits eight players are out injured and @entity13 will feature again
@entity4 have won just one game this season but @entity7 admits he loves the way @entity11 sees the game
@entity16 boss says he has spoken to @entity112 about midweek friendlies and is a fan of the idea
despite the glowing praise of @entity4 , @entity7 still insists he wants @entity2 to dominate the @entity46 fixture
