a motorbike hurtles towards me , a man carrying a goat perched pillion			0
i leap out of the way just in time and hear the warning cry - ‘ @entity6 ! @entity6 ! ’ - as two young men on bicycles heading in the opposite direction swerve around me and disappear into the throng			2
on my right , silk , silver and spice sellers jostle with leather - workers and wood carvers ; on my left people queue to buy boiled sheep ’s brains			2
musky aromas emanate from herboristas to compete with the smell of citrus , mint , cedarwood - and the odd whiff of drains			2
just desert : the @entity29 tour was an evening excursion which involved riding dromedaries ( resting in the distance ) into the 450 foot high @entity34 dunes to watch the sun go down			1
thunderstorm optional the word ' bustling ' could have been invented to describe the souks of @entity38			1
and nowhere does it seem more appropriate than here in the medina of @entity42 , where human life exists in all shades , from poverty to splendour			1
the winding passages - full of shops , locals , tourists , saucepans , mirrors , wedding dresses , children selling packs of tissues , and the odd lost kitten - seem even more vibrant than in the fabled market of @entity59 , which i passed through two days earlier			1
is it really only 48 hours since i landed in north @entity62 ? it feels a lifetime ago			0
archers has been offering mainstream and specialist holidays to destinations across the planet for 50 years			0
its 10 - night ’ highlights of @entity38 ’ package is a firm favourite - and the itinerary is exhaustive			1
our tour director @entity73 - a resident of the country for 35 years , having arrived as young rep – is a font of information , and has links with local businesses and guides all over the country			1
the group i am travelling with could not be described as young			0
pensioners with a yearning for adventure dominate this inquisitive army of 36 adventure - seekers - from the @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and the @entity93			2
my travelling companion and i are soon rather sweetly dubbed ‘ the girls ’			0
alliances and unlikely friendships are formed , and we swap contact details with people we would never have expected to meet before the trip			2
the medina in @entity42 ( left ) was a real eye - opener , teeming with life - in contrast to the tranquillity found in former palace gardens like this one in @entity108 ( right ) , which was made even more colourful by the local guide it does not take long to see why former @entity112 described his country as having ‘ one foot in @entity62 , the other in @entity115 ’			1
@entity38 is a vast and varied territory that was only united into a modern nation state in 1956			1
the rise and fall of powerful dynasties and mighty empires - a recurring pattern in its colourful history - has resulted in a melting pot of tribes , and a multi-faith society			2
while @entity127 and @entity128 is spoken by the majority , a large number of people are descended from the ancient @entity130 ( or @entity131 ) , who have preserved their own languages and customs			0
our tour is a 1,000 - mile ( 1,700 km ) round trip which takes in the labyrinthine walled cities of @entity59 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity42			1
roman ruins , ornate mosques , kasbahs and palaces with beautiful tiled courtyards are all part of our progress			0
@entity149 - capped mountains , vast barren plains and deep gorges feature heavily as we continue our journey			2
although i am unconvinced about the prospect of lengthy stints on a coach , i soon find that this is a good way of getting under the skin of a country - each day offering a totally different experience			1
from the urban sprawl of @entity139 we travel to the historic city of @entity108 - where , during a tour of the former royal stables and granaries , our local guide paints a colourful picture of the bloodthirsty 17th century megalomaniac @entity169 , who was rumoured to have sired 1,000 children			1
@entity171 and @entity172 chill out in a shepherd family 's tent in the desert ( left ) , but say no to the mint tea ... right , camels woven from palm trees are sold at the side of the road by young boys to boost the family income then we journey through vast red plains , past the occasional solitary goatherd or flock of camels , to the ancient city of @entity42			1
after a couple of days there – the chaotic medina being an obvious highlight - we travel south , through the curiously @entity194 - like chalet town of @entity195 , where the privileged go to ski			1
then we wind through the @entity197 and the spectacular @entity198 - a slash of green in the barren landscape , with more than a million trees			2
we end up in @entity203 , an oasis town on the edge of the mighty @entity29			1
king @entity205 , who began his rule in 1999 when his father @entity112 died , has brought a ( relative ) wave of democracy and modernity to the country			2
a massive road building programme ( with solar - powered street lights in places ) has been implemented to improve the movement of @entity38 ’s rural population - while the inevitable increase in tourism is mirrored by a growing number of golf courses and shopping malls			1
thankfully ( for us anyway ) there are still few modern features in the south , and an extraordinary experience in the @entity29 tour proves to be my favourite moment of the entire tour			1
from our haven of a hotel in @entity203 , a fleet of four - by - fours whizzes us into the desert			1
an hour later , we are removing our shoes outside a @entity238 shepherd ’s tent , although ( pre-warned by @entity73 that the ‘ furry bag ’ the water is stored in is in fact a goat ’s carcass ) we politely turn down the offer of mint tea			0
the next leg of our trek into the 450ft - high @entity34 dunes is on a different type of 4x4 entirely			0
atop my own personal dromedary i drink in the sight of the vast orange sands curving ahead of us , the line of majestic camels silhouetted against the sky			0
there is no sound except the occasional grunt of a camel , or call from one of the men , and an expectant hush descends as we sit in a line along the sharp edge of a dune , to watch the sunset			0
suddenly , thunder rumbles and a flash of lighting cracks the sky			0
the sand turns red as the heavens open , and our camel drivers scurry to cover us in blankets			0
a thunderstorm in the desert ! i feel blessed to experience such an incredible sight			0
our tour ends where it began - in exotic @entity59 , with its extravagant architecture and busy squares and markets			1
lights up : snake charmers , musicians and acrobats appear every night in the main square in @entity59 as dusk falls on the @entity296 square , stallholders scramble to set up their mobile restaurants , the light provided by bare bulbs hooked up to gas cylinders			1
we descend from the rooftop terrace where we have been watching the scene unfold , and sit at one of the food stalls - where we enjoy freshly fried calamari , salads and flatbreads with fiery dips , and aubergine cooked to perfection			0
families huddle in circles around flickering coloured lanterns , and men selling gaudy toys shout for custom - amid snake charmers , musicians , acrobats and storytellers			0
it is a magical scene			0
but i ca n't help drifting back to that sand dune , lightning flickering above me - an experience that touched my soul			0

@entity59 is @entity38 's most famous city , but @entity42 is also a *global* wonder
a good portion of the country can be easily seen on a 1,000 - mile round trip
@entity203 , a small town in the south , is a great base for @entity29 visits
