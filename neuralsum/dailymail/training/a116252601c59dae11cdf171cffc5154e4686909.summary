@entity0 , 42 , had no idea why she was suddenly struggling to control her asthma symptoms @entity0 had no idea why she was suddenly struggling to control her asthma symptoms			1
the nurse had been diagnosed with the condition in 2006 , after developing a tickly cough and wheeze			1
but once diagnosed , she rarely had asthma symptoms as her condition was controlled with her preventer and reliever inhalers			1
then , in march 2011 , she had an asthma attack and was admitted to hospital after going to @entity14			2
' i was wheezing , coughing a lot at night and could n't breathe properly - but , unusually , my reliever inhaler was n't helping , ' says @entity0 , 42 , from @entity18 , @entity19			1
doctors gave her stronger medications , including a nebuliser , which creates a mist of higher - dose medicine breathed in through a mask , and steroid tablets to reduce the inflammation in her airways			0
@entity0 was admitted to hospital again that september , october and november - each time two or three days before her period			1
looking back , she realised the march attack had also occurred just before her period and wondered if hormones could be to blame			2
' i knew that my asthma triggers were cold weather , dust , or a cold - but , in those instances , inhalers helped , ' she says			1
' when i suspected my hormones could be causing my attacks , i looked back at the results of my daily peak flow meter tests , which measure how quickly you can exhale air and indicate your lung function			2
' they showed levels of my airflow dropped about a week before every period , becoming critical about two days before and improving a few days after a period ended			1
my consultant said that he 'd seen such cases before			0
' @entity53 - which affects 5.4 million @entity54 - makes airways become inflamed when in contact with a trigger , causing characteristic symptoms such as coughing , shortness of breath and wheezing			2
typically , pollen , dust and pet hair have been identified as common triggers - but , increasingly , evidence suggests that hormones can be a significant trigger in women			0
' it 's thought that 25 to 40 per cent of female asthmatics may have pre-menstrual associated asthma symptoms , with 4 to 5 per cent having a more severe deterioration , which may lead to an attack , ' says dr @entity75 , a consultant respiratory physician at @entity77 , in @entity78 , and @entity79 , in @entity80			1
and it 's telling that asthma is more likely to affect adult women during their reproductive years			2
before puberty , asthma affects more boys than girls ; after puberty , when girls ' levels of female sex hormones - such as oestrogen and progesterone - rise , more women are affected than men			1
adult - onset asthma is more common among women			2
professor @entity98 , a former consultant gynaecologist at @entity99 and @entity100 , in @entity80 , says it is likely to be the hormone changes that occur between ovulation and a period starting that cause the symptoms			1
as well as puberty , a key time when asthma can first develop in women is the years before the menopause ( known as the peri-menopause ) , when they experience irregular periods and fluctuating hormones			2
though asthma is often thought of as a childhood disease , it can first develop at any age			2
a key time when asthma can first develop in women is the years before the menopause ' worryingly for these women , their condition is more likely to be severe , with many experiencing more asthma attacks at this early stage , ' says @entity128 , chief executive of charity asthma @entity129			1
' yet years of underfunding of research - and the lack of women in clinical trials - mean the exact reasons why more adult women have asthma than men remain a relative mystery			2
' women who already have asthma may also find it gets worse around the menopause , says ms @entity128			2
indeed , 76 per cent of callers to the @entity129 helpline are women , and many are aged 45 to 55 - the average age of the menopause in @entity54 is 51			0
a study published in the @entity152 last year found that menopausal women with asthma had a 95 per cent higher risk of symptoms			1
ms @entity128 says women need to be vigilant with their asthma care during those years , making sure they have annual asthma reviews with their doctor or nurse and a written asthma action plan , including steps on how to lower their risk of a potentially - fatal asthma attack			1
after the menopause , when hormone levels have fallen and stabilised , asthma incidence declines in women , unless they take hormone replacement therapy ( @entity171 ) , according to a 2009 paper from the @entity173			1
pregnancy can also affect asthma			2
during this time , hormone levels are not fluctuating , progesterone levels are consistently high and oestrogen is suppressed			0
a third of pregnant women with asthma will find their symptoms improve , a third get worse and the rest stay the same - so hormones seem to affect their asthma differently , says dr @entity75			1
typical asthma treatments , such as inhalers and steroids , may have little effect when hormones seem to be a trigger - instead , some women can only control symptoms through treatments that target hormones			1
' chest physicians do n't always recognise the effect hormones can have on asthma , which is a tragedy because it is easily treated , ' says professor @entity98			0
he adds that oestrogen patches , gels and creams , which suppress ovulation and hormonal changes , can help			0
in extreme cases , and once a woman has completed her family , she may be offered a hysterectomy , with removal of her ovaries followed by the appropriate hormone replacement therapy			0
yet while some studies have found that oestrogen treatments are effective , others show progesterone is the key			0
' more research is needed because many of the existing studies are contradictory , ' says dr @entity75			0
' asthma varies hugely among patients , so it 's likely hormones wo n't affect all women in the same way			0
treatments should be tailored to the individual			0
' once @entity0 's doctors realised the significance of her monthly cycles , they tried a number of treatments not usually given to treat asthma			1
initially , she was given drugs to reduce her oestrogen levels			0
when these did n't help , she was given three - monthly injections of @entity241 , a treatment more commonly given to treat breast and prostate cancer , which acts on the pituitary gland in the brain to prevent production of oestrogen and progesterone			0
asthma treatments such as inhalers and steroids may have little effect when hormones seem to be a trigger but every time @entity0 had the jabs , she initially suffered an asthma attack , resulting in a hospital stay			1
last february , she ended up on a ventilator and spent three weeks in intensive care , because her oxygen levels were so low and due to developing pneumonia ( inflammation of the lungs ) as a result of the asthma attack			1
she was taken off the @entity241 , but the lack of oxygen caused lasting memory and balance problems			0
she was also left with drop foot ( weakness or paralysis in one foot ) because of the position she was put in while she was unconscious			0
' half the month , my asthma was controlled by my medication , but they did n't work when it was bad , ' says @entity0 , who has been unable to work since late 2011 as a result of her condition			1
' when it gets worse , it feels as if i 'm trying to breathe sucking through a straw that 's stuck together - i 'm desperately trying to get air in , but i ca n't			0
' i was so desperate for a normal life again that i 'd planned to get my ovaries removed last spring - even though i do n't have children - but my severe attack in february meant i was n't well enough for surgery			0
' however , there was a reprieve - the @entity241 appeared to have triggered the menopause as @entity0 's periods stopped , and her asthma symptoms improved			1
but last september , her periods and symptoms returned			0
her consultant advised she took the mini-pill , which contains only progesterone			0
so far , it has been effective			0
@entity0 believes there are other women who have n't realised hormones are affecting their asthma			1
' i do n't think all doctors are aware of this link , either , ' she says			0
' more needs to be said about it so women can get the treatment they need			0

@entity0 , 42 , was suddenly struggling to control her asthma
the nurse from @entity18 , @entity19 , rarely had symptoms
her condition was controlled with her preventer and reliever inhalers
but tests showed levels of airflow dropped shortly before every period
