by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 04:18 est , 15 march 2012 like this , just a bit smaller : the @entity3 may bring an eight - inch tablet to the table @entity6 are looking at launching an ' @entity3 ' later this year , bringing an eight - inch younger brother into the fold , according to a rumour from a well - placed source			1
@entity6 are notoriously secretive about upcoming products , but this leak comes from inside @entity13 , a company which holds the unique position of being @entity6 's fiercest competitor - and one of their biggest hardware suppliers			1
the source from within @entity13 made the ' mini ' indescretion while talking to the @entity21 about how @entity6 spends £ 7billion on @entity13 components , which go into @entity6 's iphones , @entity24 and macbooks			1
the leaky official said : ' the amount of the current contract [ between @entity6 and @entity13 ] is around $ 9.7billion			1
' the contract is expected to rise to $ 11billion by the end of this year as @entity6 is planning to release a smaller @entity3 , probably with a 7.85 - inch screen , and to sell more of its @entity32 using @entity13 ’s faster solid state drive ( @entity35 ) storage			1
' the @entity3 would add variety to @entity6 's one - size - fits - all approach , and would be more portable			1
it will also show that @entity6 is prepared to break away from former chief exec @entity40 ' deeply - held mantras			2
the @entity6 leader , who passed away last october , publicly derided the smaller tablet model , in particular the seven - inch form - factor , which is becoming a standard for a smaller tablet			1
in a 2010 earnings call , he said : ' one naturally thinks that a seven - inch screen would offer 70 percent of the benefits of a ten - inch screen			0
' unfortunately , this is far from the truth			0
… the reason we wo n't make a seven - inch tablet is n’t because we do n’t want to hit a lower price point , it ’s because we think the screen is too small to express the software			0
' not a fan : @entity40 , father of the @entity3 , said a seven - inch tablet did not offer the best experience however a segment of the market is likely to disagree with @entity40 , particularly with the rise of the ebook reader and @entity68 tablets which come in all shapes and sizes			1
consumers like commuters and travellers will find the size ( almost ) pocket - friendly , and @entity75 are likely to lead the mainstream acceptance of smaller tablets when they bring out their own seven - inch @entity68 tablet before the summer			0
on the other hand , the risk to @entity6 is that a different - sized tablet might lead to fragmentation - where apps and games need re-configuring by their developers to ensure they are compatible on both versions			2
this has been @entity68 's biggest issue in the last few years			0
different screen sizes , different manufacturers , different versions of the operating system and different price - points all lead to choice for the consumer - but at the cost of development headaches and an inconsistent experience			0
indeed , one indie developer , @entity100 , decided to stop supporting @entity68 this week , stating @entity68 was costing them so much in tweaking that it was swallowing all their profits			0
@entity6 has avoided all these problems so far by keeping full ownership of the product line , and keeping a uniform screen size for their two big ranges , iphones and @entity3			1
the only major fragmentation that occurs is as older models become obsolete			0
@entity13 has a full complement of phones and tablets to compete with @entity6 , such as the five - inch note @entity13 is a very strange bed - fellow of @entity6			2
to the consumers , they are arch - rivals , with the @entity119 smartphone competing directly with the @entity120 and being the runaway success of @entity68 in the last year			0
in the courts the fighting is even more fierce , with @entity6 repeatedly trying - and sometimes succeeding - in getting injunctions to stop @entity13 selling phones and tablets around the world , claiming patent infrigement			1
but in business , @entity13 is one of @entity6 's top suppliers - and @entity6 will spend up to £ 7billion on @entity13 parts for their products this year , according to the @entity13 leak			1
the leak also said the amount is expected to increase until at least 2014 under the current terms of their contract , following a deal between @entity13 and @entity6 's ceo @entity139			2
the @entity21 also said that @entity6 bought around £ 4.9billion worth of parts from @entity13 in 2011 including displays , mobile application processors , nand flash chips and mobile memory			1
you will find @entity13 processors , displays and memory chips inside the new @entity3			2
the source continued : ' @entity6 ’s top management still believes @entity13 is the only parts maker in the world ideally - positioned to meet all of the critical conditions - better pricing , technologically - enhanced products , on - time delivery and the capability to immediately respond to any emergency situation			1
' however one thing @entity6 may not like is the lack of discretion , as they plan the hype and launch of their new products down to the smallest details			0
the source also said that @entity13 's oled panel supplies - the type which power @entity13 's top - range smartphones - may appear in future @entity170 , if @entity13 is able to output the screens in high - enough quantities			0
@entity6 's much - admired ' @entity174 ' displays are also manufactured by @entity13			2
also on the rumour mill today are suggestions that @entity6 's anticipated television set - the @entity178 - will launch towards the end of the year			2
analyst @entity180 said yesterday that panel suppliers are gearing up to begin production in may or june , and therefore the television may launch in the few months leading up to @entity184			0
@entity6 has played in the tv market before , with @entity186 working like a set - top box to pump videos to flat - screens			0
but with the tech built inside , and @entity6 's respected attention to detail and usability , the tv industry may be in for a bit of a revolution , as @entity6 did before for the music , movie , tv and phone industries .			0

@entity13 insider leaks ' @entity3 '
new model ' will have 7.85ins screen '
@entity40 derided the idea of a smaller tablet
@entity6 and @entity13 are fierce rivals ( even though @entity6 spends £ *7bn* a year on @entity13 parts )
