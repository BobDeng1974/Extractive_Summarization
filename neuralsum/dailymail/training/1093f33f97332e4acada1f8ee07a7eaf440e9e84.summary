by @entity1 reporter published : 17:44 est , 8 december 2013 @entity3 : 00:28 est , 9 december 2013 some parents intent on being different have thrown out the most common baby names this year in favor of some very peculiar monikers			1
at least three newborns were named cheese this year , for example			2
and that ’s just the boys			2
on the girls side came such out - of - left field choices as @entity15 and @entity16			1
scroll down for full list ... @entity18 : while searching for the most popular baby names of 2013 , the website @entity19 stumbled upon some of the weirdest the parenting website @entity19 put together their list of the most common baby names of the year after surveying half a million parents			1
while the decidedly unscientific method of simply asking around yielded some expected results — @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 top among them — it also uncovered some oddities			0
the survey found that at least three parents out of the half a million had named their new baby things like @entity9 , @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44			1
and those are just a few of the stranger boys names			1
my son the car : at least three parents named their sons after the chevrolet motor company in 2013 the weird girl names include @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56			1
while some seem random , others among the bizarre names have a familiar ring to them			0
@entity62 , for instance , conjures images of the glory days of baseball in @entity66			0
though it should be noted , it ’s on the girl list			0
@entity69 is n’t just a bath and tile scrub but also a classical soldier ’s name			0
it ’s on the boy list			0
two for one : for girls , @entity62 was named as one of the oddest baby names of the year			2
and @entity79 was one of the boy names in addition to @entity9 , other food related names include @entity85 , @entity16 and @entity86			1
bears were also a popular inspiration			0
included on the weird name list were @entity79 , @entity90 , and @entity91 ( all boys )			1
like the top names in @entity19 ’s survey , the bottom names are just a guess at the oddest names of 2013			2
the official list wo n’t be released until may			0
however , the top names will likely be the names we see popping up everywhere like @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity35 , and @entity104			0
the list of weirdest names , on the other hand , is likely to get both longer and stranger			0
