@entity0 famously used to say his @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 was worth 18 points a season when @entity5 were winning league titles and @entity7			0
well , @entity8 could beat even that – on current form he is going to earn @entity11 an extra 24 points in this campaign			2
in the last two months , @entity14 has helped turn likely defeats against @entity16 and @entity17 into victories , and enabled them to draw with @entity20 and beat @entity21			1
@entity8 punches the air in celebration after his saves helped earn @entity11 three more points @entity26 congratulates his club and international team - mate after the keeper had earned yet more points those extra nine points won buy @entity11 in the first 14 matches equate to 24 points over a 38 - game season			1
and without the super @entity35 , @entity11 would be sitting in 11th place with 16 points – not in a top - four @entity39 spot			0
this is how @entity14 's influence can be broken down			2
october 5 – @entity11 2 @entity16 1 points saved : three it is no exaggeration to say @entity11 could have lost , let alone drawn , against @entity16 had it not been for @entity14 's heroics			1
his first vital intervention was to save a penalty from @entity47 – diving low to his right to get a strong hand to the spot - kick , the first one @entity47 had missed in 15 penalty attempts			0
@entity47 sees his penalty saved , the first time the @entity55 had been denied from the spot then , with @entity16 pushing for a late equaliser , @entity14 made a flying save to tip away a shot from @entity60 and followed up with an incredible leap to get his fingertips to a @entity64 half - volley that was heading for the postage stamp in the very top corner			1
he was immediately mobbed by @entity67 and other @entity11 defenders while @entity16 boss @entity69 put his head in his hands on the touchline			2
once @entity11 had taken the lead @entity14 kept them in front with a stunning double save to deny @entity16 october 26 – @entity11 1 @entity20 1 points saved : one @entity79 's injury - time equaliser gave @entity11 a massive pyschological lift for the remainder of the season , but @entity20 would already have been out of sight if not for @entity14			1
the @entity35 showed good judgement and reflexes to save from @entity87 and @entity84 in one - against - one situations , @entity84 could n't believe he had been denied with his clever low finish to the corner			0
even more critically , once @entity20 had gone in front through @entity87 , @entity14 kept out a rising shot from @entity92 that would have given the unassailable 2 - 0 lead			0
not only did he stop the 25 - yard drive , he caught it – and was able to immediately launch a @entity11 counter-attack			0
november 22 – @entity17 1 @entity11 2 points saved : three both managers said afterwards @entity17 had been the better team at the @entity97			2
the home side ended up empty - handed though because of their nine shots on target , only one beat @entity14 – and that was a late effort from @entity104 when it was too late			0
@entity14 does brilliantly to deny @entity105 as @entity17 dominated the game but could not take the lead the @entity109 keeper saved eight of @entity17 's nine shots on target , and @entity11 snatched all three points @entity14 was n't even a guaranteed starter after dislocating his finger on international duty with @entity117 , but you could n't tell as he made a string of saves , most notably from @entity105 , @entity121 and his former @entity11 team - mate @entity122			1
december 2 – man utd 2 @entity21 1 points saved : two praised by manager @entity125 for keeping his ' concentration and focus ' after two fantastic late saves to earn @entity11 a win having previously been a spectator for 89 minutes			1
@entity132 's late header would have put @entity21 level , but @entity14 made a sharp stop to preserve @entity11 's lead it was clear to see how much another win , @entity11 's fourth on the bounce , meant to the young @entity109 stopper first , he somehow managed to block a bullet header from @entity141 right on the line with a combination of arms , legs and body when the @entity21 forward could n't have been more than four yards out			1
and with @entity21 pressing , he then stopped a fierce drive by @entity148 at point - blank range total points saved by @entity151 – nine			0

@entity11 goalkeeper @entity8 has been in superb form
@entity14 made *crucial* saves against @entity16 , @entity20 , @entity17 and @entity21
without their keeper , @entity11 would be in 11th position in the league
with @entity14 's heroics @entity125 's team are currently fourth
