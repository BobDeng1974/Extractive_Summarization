@entity0 , 31 , died at @entity1 after a catalogue of errors by staff			1
an inquest heard staff accused her of faking illness a 31 - year - old mentally ill patient died unnecessarily because of a catalogue of errors by @entity11 staff , an inquest has concluded			1
@entity0 , from @entity13 , @entity1 , died at @entity1 on march 8 , 2012 , after taking an overdose of painkillers			1
while at the hospital she was left in the care of unqualified healthcare assistants , was believed to be faking her illness despite being in a deep coma , and was not given the antidote which could have saved her life , the inquest heard			1
her medical notes were also written on the back of a glove which was subsequently lost , and staff mixed up her blood samples with those from another patient			1
the coroner , @entity31 , delivered a narrative verdict , which stated that : ' there was a failure to undertake and report on her regular observations and a failure to recognise her deteriorating condition or the seriousness of her situation that resulted in a lost opportunity to render further effective treatment before she went into respiratory arrest caused by obstruction of her airway , attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and she died at 11.18 on 8th march 2012			1
' ms @entity0 , who had a history of mental illness , arrived at the hospital ’s @entity11 department at midnight on march 7 , 2012			1
initially , she told staff that she had not taken any drugs			0
she later told staff she had in fact taken @entity60			0
she was well known to the department ’s staff but they failed to administer the antidote which would have counteracted the effects of the painkiller within minutes			2
her family ’s lawyer , @entity67 , a partner in the clinical negligence department of @entity70 , told @entity71 : ‘ there is no record of anyone having considered giving her the antidote			0
‘ the whole attitude of the staff was clouded by the fact that she was a regular attender – she was not treated as the vulnerable patient that she was			0
’ ms @entity0 was left in the care of a healthcare assistant , instead of a nurse , and only two sets of formal observations were taken during her 11 hours in the hospital			1
one of these sets of results was written on a surgical glove which was then lost			1
ms @entity0 was left in the care of healthcare assistants instead of fully qualified nurses			1
she was believed to be faking her illness despite being in a deep coma			0
she was not given the antidote which could have saved her life			0
her medical notes were written on the back of a glove which was then lost			1
her blood samples were mixed up with those of another patient			1
the second set of observations was taken by a healthcare assistant at 8.30am but she failed to report the seriously abnormal results to her seniors			1
ms @entity67 said : ‘ either the @entity109 did not recognise the danger signs or she did , and she failed to pass on the information			0
‘ if the findings had been passed on , @entity0 would have been put on half hourly observations and her rapid deterioration in the following hours would have been spotted			0
‘ the coroner believes that the observations should have been carried out by a fully qualified nurse because having @entity109 ’s playing this role is a major risk to a patient ’s life			2
’ the inquest also heard that ms @entity0 had been placed to sleep on her back which resulted in her breathing becoming obstructed and caused her death			2
while she was in the hospital staff also mixed her blood gas samples with that of another patient			2
she died at 11.20am after she stopped breathing			0
@entity131 , ms @entity0 ’s sister , said : ‘ @entity0 may have suffered with mental health issues but to the family she was a fun - loving and caring person who was very much adored by every one of us			0
‘ @entity0 was a very much loved aunt , daughter and sister who we all miss desperately			0
‘ it has been incredibly difficult to come to terms with her untimely death			0
we wish she was still here bringing smiles to us all and we 'll never forget her			0
while at the hospital ( pictured ) she was left in the care of unqualified healthcare assistants , was accused of faking her illness despite being in a deep coma , and was not given the antidote which could have saved her life ‘ we can only hope that her tragic death will bring a change to attitudes towards mental health patients who are being treated in a general hospital and make it a safer place for the vulnerable and those struggling with mental illness			1
’ ms @entity67 added : ‘ @entity0 ’s inquest has highlighted the problems that vulnerable patients with mental health issues can encounter in hospitals and i hope that the @entity1 will have learnt lessons from this			2
‘ i can only hope that the family can take some comfort from knowing that as a direct result of @entity0 ’s death the coroner has written to the secretary of state for health asking her to consider changing hospital policy so that observations taken in patients who are seriously ill , like @entity0 , are to be carried out by trained nurses			1
‘ as the coroner said , this should mean that @entity0 has not died in vain			2
’ she told @entity71 : ‘ it is clear that due to staff shortages it has become general practice in hospitals for healthcare assistants to take nursing observations			2
‘ whilst this may be acceptable in patients that are not seriously ill , for patients that are very ill or have for example taken an overdose , like @entity0 , observations should be taken by fully trained nurses who are able to take them and then to interpret them properly			1
the hospital has apologised that ' @entity0 did not consistently receive the high level of care that we expect ' ‘ if that had been done on the night that @entity0 was admitted to hospital then she would most likely still be here today			0
’ @entity199 , chief executive of of @entity1 , said : ' our thoughts are with @entity0 ’s family at this difficult time			2
' @entity0 sadly passed away in our @entity203 in march 2012			2
we are sorry that @entity0 did not consistently receive the high level of care that we expect			0
' since @entity0 ’s death , we have conducted an investigation to ensure lessons are learned			0
we will be continuing to improve our service in regard to emergency patients			0
' the coroner has issued a rule 43 to the secretary of state for health to express his concerns about the national practice of healthcare assistants ( @entity217 ) taking crucial observations			1
' we have already commissioned the @entity219 to provide training for 50 of our @entity221 ( @entity217 ) to build on their skills			0
