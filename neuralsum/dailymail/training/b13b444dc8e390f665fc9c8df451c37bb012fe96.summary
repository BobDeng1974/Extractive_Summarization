by @entity0 a royal blue lobster has been saved from the boiling pot thanks to his rare colouring			2
@entity5 , from @entity6 , was sorting through his catch when he spotted a lobster with a royal blue shell among the other regular lobsters in the pot. it was a unusual discovery - only one in two million lobsters can have a mutation that allows them to have a blue outer shell			1
a royal blue lobster has been saved from the boiling pot due to his unusual colouring mr @entity5 , who has fished on the @entity21 , @entity22 , for 32 years , said : ' i 'd caught blue ones before but never one so blue ' mr @entity5 , who has fished on the @entity21 , @entity22 , for 32 years , said : ' i noticed a flash of blue when i pulled the lobster pots up and as i looked in i saw it was a blue lobster			1
' i ’d caught blue ones before but never one so blue			1
' it ’s not often you see blue lobsters and even this one ’s antenna was blue so it was a very rare catch			2
' i was going to sell it but re-considered as i thought it was too rare to just give away so i decided to keep it in the tank in our fish and chip shop in @entity6			0
' its colour has faded slightly since it ’s been in the tank but it ’s very popular , a lot of people come in just to see it ! ' normally appearing brown or dark green in nature prior to boiling , scientists say just one lobster in two million is blue - the result of a genetic defect that causes them to produce an excessive amount of protein			2
the blue lobster is no different to a regular lobster - it is only the mutation which influences the lobsters outer shell colour			1
ordinary : prior to being cooked and turning red , most lobsters are found in browns and dark greens , as seen in this file photo of them removed from a cage at sea scientists say just one lobster in two million is blue - the result of a genetic defect that causes them to produce an excessive amount of protein			1
the blue lobster is no different from the regular lobster - it ’s only the mutation which influences the lobsters outer shell colour			1
they can be found any place where regular lobsters are found			0
a research study conducted by professor @entity79 , at the @entity80 , @entity81 , found that excessive levels of a protein combines with a red caratenoid molecule known as astaxanthin , forming a blue complex known as crustacyanin			0
it is this that makes the lobster blue			2
in 2006 lobsterman @entity91 caught a yellow lobster near @entity93 in the @entity81 at the mouth of the @entity95			0
the odds of finding a yellow lobster are approximately 1 in 30 million			0
it is estimated that only about one in 100 million lobsters are albino - lacking in coloured pigments			1
they are known as ' white ' or ' crystal ' lobsters			0
they can be found any place where regular lobsters are found			0
in 2008 a rare blue lobster was found off the @entity107 and in 2012 another fisherman caught one off the coast of @entity110			2
according to researchers at the @entity113 lobsters have been found in even more rare colours than blue			0
according to the @entity117 , one - out - of - 10 million lobsters are found in a bright red colour			2
even rarer , however , are yellow and calico lobsters - speckled with yellows and oranges - which both have an estimated one - in - 30 million chance of finding			0
mr @entity5 said he is now planning to release it back into the ocean at the end of the summer			1
the blue lobster was not the only spectacular catch mr @entity5 has made in the last month			1
he also caught a monster lobster , weighing in a whopping nine pounds			0
' the big lobster weighed in around nine pounds , its claws were huge and it ’s definitely the biggest one i ’ve seen in a while			0
' i was n’t too sure what to do with it but then i was contacted by the @entity136 at @entity137 who have now tagged it and it ’s been released back into the ocean , ' added mr @entity5 .			1

@entity5 caught the lobster on the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity143
only one in two million lobsters have mutation that gives them a blue shell
mr @entity5 : ' i 'd caught blue ones before but never one so blue '
