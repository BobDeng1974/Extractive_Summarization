@entity0 was today criticised for describing @entity2 's late son @entity1 as ' retarded ' during his testimony at the @entity4			1
the 81 - year - old casually used the word , which is now deemed offensive , for the disabled boy as he explained how much admiration he had for the prime minister 's kindness towards his children			2
the media tycoon was telling the hearing about his relationship with @entity2 during the period when the prime minister became the opposition leader of the @entity19			1
@entity2 tenderly kisses his son @entity1 's cheek at home in 2004			0
@entity1 needed round - the - clock care and died in 2009 aged six ' unfortunate ' : @entity0 referred to @entity2 's late son @entity1 as ' retarded ' during his testimony at the @entity4 in @entity25 today mr @entity0 said : ' i first met him once , maybe even twice , at family picnics at weekends at my daughter 's house in the grounds of @entity31 ( @entity31 in @entity32 ) where he came with his family			1
' we were overrun with children , there were no politics			0
' but i was extremely impressed at the kindness and feeling he showed to the children , particularly to his retarded son			0
' and i came away talking about this - what a good family man			2
' @entity46 suffered from severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy and died in 2009 aged six			1
he had needed round - the - clock care			1
the chief executive of the @entity51 today criticised mr @entity0 's ' unfortunate ' language			1
caring : @entity2 and his wife @entity53 with their late son @entity1 , who suffered from severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy , in 2008 @entity2 talking to @entity0 at the wedding of @entity58 to @entity59 in june 2009 @entity60 , the organisation 's chief executive , said : ' it 's an unfortunate turn of phrase			1
using it is very much of a certain age and 81 - year - olds do tend to use words that we would n't use today			2
the word ' retard ' originated in the late 15th century and comes from the @entity73 word ' retarder ' , which itself derives from the @entity75 ' retardare ' meaning backwards or slow			2
after centuries of being used as an official medical adjective to describe a mentally disabled person , it has become increasingly offensive to use the word in recent decades			2
by the late 20th century , the word had become slang for describing someone who had done something idiotic or foolish			2
but it was n't until 2006 that the term ' mental retardation ' was dropped by the @entity88 and the organisation was renamed @entity88 in 2008 , a poll by the @entity91 concluded that ' retard ' was the most offensive disability - related word			2
' we would hope that people now would be more enlightened that to use such negative terminology			0
' meanwhile @entity98 , campaigns and policy officer for learning disability charity @entity101 , said : ' from @entity101 's point of view , the use of the word is completely outdated and it is quite shocking that someone of @entity0 's standing , who is supposed to be close to public views and the public opinion , would be so careless in his choice of language			1
' @entity101 campaigns against the use of this sort of language and really wants a positive representation of disabled people and while high profile figures are continuing to use this sort of language we know that is never going to happen			1
' we want people to be aware of how damaging this language is and move beyond the use of that word			2
' in a written statement , mr @entity0 said : ' mr @entity2 , since his election as prime minister , i have met principally in social settings , where little of substance was discussed			1
' i do recall that , shortly after his election , mr @entity2 invited me in for tea at @entity136			2
he thanked me for the support of our papers			0
@entity2 and @entity140 pictured with their children including @entity1 , left , who died in 2009 aged just six			1
they have since had another daughter , @entity144 ' i congratulated him and told him that i was sure our titles would watch carefully and report whether he kept all of his campaign promises			0
the meeting lasted at most 20 minutes			0
' but the tycoon denied any involvement in the appointment of former @entity154 editor @entity153 as mr @entity2 's communications chief in may 2007			2
the @entity157 ' first child , @entity1 was born in 2002 with a rare form of cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy			1
though the couple were initially told by doctors he was suffering a kidney malfunction , @entity1 was eventually diagnosed with @entity164 - a rare neurological disorder characterised by seizures			2
doctors told the couple that some children with @entity164 die in infancy , while others live for years but with profound disability			0
mr @entity2 ensured @entity1 was christened at the ' earliest opportunity ' because of the lack of clarity about his prospects			0
genetic experts told the couple there was a one in 20 chance of future children being born with the condition , though happily @entity182 and @entity183 are healthy			0
the @entity157 had to adapt their home in @entity25 to accommodate @entity1 , who needed a special lift to get him in and out of his bath			0
though his condition meant he could not move his limbs or speak , the @entity157 drew strength from the fact that he appeared to respond to their love and care			0
' i was just as surprised as anyone else , ' he told the hearing			0
mr @entity0 also recalled how an ' unbalanced ' @entity197 ' declared war ' on his media empire after switching sides to support the @entity201 at the last election			1
but he said claims that mr @entity197 had ‘ roared at him for 20 minutes ’ were a ' colourful exaggeration '			0
he went on to recount in detail the conversation he had with the former prime minister			0
mr @entity0 recalled how mr @entity197 asked : ‘ do you know what 's going on here ? , ’ when the front page of the @entity209 was published declaring support for @entity2 in september 2009			1
mr @entity0 said he replied : ‘ i was not warned of the exact timing , i 'm not aware of what they 're saying , but i 'm sorry to tell you @entity197 we will support a change of government if there is an election			1
’ he then said mr @entity197 responded : ‘ well , your company has declared war on the government			0
we have no alternative but to declare war on your company			0
’ he replied : ‘ i 'm sorry to hear that @entity197			0
mr @entity0 said today : ' i did not think he was in a very balanced state of mind			1
' during today 's hearing mr @entity0 faced repeated questioning over whether he sought to influence the politics of @entity235 through the power of his numerous newspapers			1
but at each turn , speaking deliberately and slowly , he denied ever seeking favours , and at one point thumped the table to say : ' in ten years of his power , i never asked @entity243 for anything , nor indeed did i receive any favours			0
' in addition , mr @entity0 said that he admired , and still does admire @entity247 - but denied he was ' one of the main powers ' behind her leadership and denied consulting with her regularly on important policy matters			1
he again insisted : ' i 've never asked a prime minister for anything '			0
he also denied ever talking to mr @entity2 about the £ 8bn @entity256 bid			0
mr @entity0 said it was ‘ pure coincidence ’ that the @entity256 bid was launched a month after mr @entity2 took power			1
the inquiry - which also saw one person ejected by police for refusing to sit down - heard that mr @entity0 visited @entity263 by the back door weeks earlier on 10 may 2010 to congratulate mr @entity2 on winning the election .			1
