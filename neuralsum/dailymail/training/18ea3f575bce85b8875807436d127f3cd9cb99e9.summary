appropriate dress : the @entity1 prefers people in public to cover up , including shoulders and knees advice cards ordering shoppers to cover up at a @entity9 shopping mall have been branded ' unfair ' and ' humiliating ' by tourists and ex-pats			1
in the latest crackdown on those who flout the @entity1 ' strict dress code , security guards at @entity16 , have been handing out the cards to men and women who are deemed to be dressed inappropriately			1
the blue cards tell customers to wear ' respectful clothing ' that covers the shoulders and knees at all times			1
the cards also explain what is considered acceptable clothing , and what is not			1
although signs asking shoppers to follow the dress code have been put up at the mall 's entrances , staff say they are either not being read , or people are deliberately ignoring them			1
one employee , who asked not to be named , said : ' we put up a lot of posters , but everyone ignores them , this is the only way to tell people directly			2
' according to @entity46 , ' dozens of women ' at the mall yesterday were breaching the rules by showing off their shoulders and knees			2
although @entity51 , from the @entity52 , was wearing a dress which exposed her shoulders , she had not been handed a card			2
she said : ' i do n’t think i ’m breaking any rules			2
i ’m not wearing beachwear , that ’s why no one has said anything			0
' an @entity63 shopper , who asked only to be named as @entity64 , said she thought the rule unfairly targeted women			0
she added : ' i see men walking around in shorts all the time , but women ca n’t do the same			0
that does n’t seem fair			0
' reminder : @entity9 has strict policies when it comes to dress , and baring shoulders and knees is inappropriate @entity78 , from the @entity77 , believed it would be humiliating to be told directly that they were inappropriately dressed			1
she said : ' i would be very embarrassed if they said that			0
i do n’t think i ’d want to come back to the mall if they treat people like that			0
' another employee at the mall , who declined to be named , said the rule was applied only for the most flagrant breaches			0
they said : ' we only give it to those people who are dressed totally unacceptably			1
this is @entity9 ’s rules , not just the rules of the mall			0
' @entity101 , which operates @entity16 and the @entity102 , declined to comment			1
but the issue of inappropriate clothing remains a key talking point			1
last year @entity1 @entity106 and @entity107 launched @entity109 page @ @entity110 , which regularly posts on issues of modest dress in public places , and now has 4,600 followers			0
cover up : tourists flock to @entity9 in droves , but one shopping centre is ordering them to dress appropriately cultural adviser and columnist for @entity46 , @entity121 , said the problem was due to a lack of clarity over what constituted ' disrespectful ' dress			2
he said : ' it ’s always a grey area on how to judge it , on what ’s okay and what ’s not okay			0
' we keep hoping that people would kindly understand that when you ’re revealing a lot of skin , like a short skirt or showing your shoulder or chest , this would definitely be considered not modest			0
' this goes for everyone , including men			0
' mr @entity121 insisted the @entity16 initiative was ' just an extra reminder , on top of all the other many reminders ' , and claimed that tougher rules needed to be introduced			1
he added : ' everything can be solved easily if the mall did n’t let people inappropriately dressed people enter in the first place			1
