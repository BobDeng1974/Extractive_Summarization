@entity0 must somehow shut out the deafening noise enveloping @entity3 cricket and concentrate on what has become one of the most important @entity7 series of his career			1
defeat against @entity9 in a three - @entity7 battle that begins here on monday is simply unthinkable for an @entity13 captain who is desperate to avoid being distracted by the seismic changes going on all around him			1
there has been so much happening , from the demise of @entity19 , to speculation surrounding the new director of cricket and the ever - present spectre of @entity24 , that the imminent first @entity7 has barely registered			1
@entity0 in the nets ahead of the first test in the @entity9 of a vitally important series for his career @entity0 and his @entity13 team - mates share a few words in practice ahead of the first test on monday @entity9 ( probable ) : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( captain and wkt ) , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45			1
@entity13 ( probable ) : @entity0 ( captain ) , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( wkt ) , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56			1
umpires : @entity58 ( @entity59 ) and @entity60 ( @entity61 )			0
tv umpire : @entity63 ( @entity59 )			0
match referee : @entity65 ( @entity66 )			0
tv and radio : @entity69 ( from 2.30pm ) and @entity70 ( from 2.45pm )			0
chance of showers on all five days and strong cross-wind throughout which will affect bowling and make reverse swing crucial			2
26 ° c yet @entity0 knows that he , and coach @entity77 , can afford no slip - ups in what should be the least taxing assignment of @entity13 ’s ridiculous schedule of 17 tests in the next nine months			1
in less chaotic times @entity56 ’s 100th @entity7 appearance and his chances of securing the four victims he needs to overtake sir @entity86 and become @entity13 ’s leading @entity7 wicket - taker would dominate the agenda			1
equally , the return of @entity47 , who looks set to open with @entity0 , 18 months after he left @entity13 ’s @entity93 tour in a state of turmoil is a significant development that has virtually passed under the radar			1
instead all eyes are on the duo whose futures are in the balance with an arch - critic of both , @entity101 , favourite to become supremo even though he has played down his links to the job			0
@entity0 has seemed relaxed in his first week in the @entity106 and looked in good touch while scoring a hundred against @entity109 with the slightly altered stance he has been working on with @entity111			2
@entity0 ( left ) and coach @entity77 ( right ) know they ca n't afford any slip - ups in the @entity106 this month @entity0 has slightly altered his batting stance after working with @entity111 in his enforced off - season he made three half centuries in his last four test innings against @entity117 last summer while leading @entity13 to three successive victories , yet the disaster of a @entity120 that went on without him has heaped pressure back on his side			1
that pressure can only have been increased by the somehow inevitable news that @entity24 had smashed a huge century on his return to the domestic game with @entity127 yesterday , albeit against the students of @entity129			1
@entity13 , both publicly and privately , still insist that nothing has changed regarding @entity24 and there seemed a genuine indifference from @entity0 when asked about the sacked maverick for the umpteenth time on sunday			1
@entity24 hit 170 off 149 balls against @entity129 as he put on a show for @entity127 @entity56 ( left ) will make his 100th @entity7 appearance as @entity0 looks to get the tour off to winning ways ‘ i ’m pleased he scored runs for @entity127 but it is exactly what i said before we came here , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s for other people to make any decision regarding him			0
’ the difference now , of course , is that the two men most responsible for jettisoning @entity24 after the @entity93 have gone , @entity19 having been sacked and former @entity151 chairman @entity150 now marginalised as the new president			1
it was @entity19 who put so much faith in @entity0 to lead a new @entity13 era that the captain still believes is full of promise			1
‘ it ’s sad when anyone gets fired , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it ’s not a nice feeling in any walk of life			0
@entity19 is a good man and i feel for him but as players and staff we have to concentrate on the next three weeks			0
’ @entity47 has returned to the test side equally , @entity0 did not want to think about the implications of what will happen when the new men at the helm in chairman elect @entity174 and new chief executive @entity175 continue their revolution of the @entity3 game			1
‘ i have absolutely no idea , ’ said @entity0 when asked about the new director of cricket			0
‘ i ’m probably reading less about it than anyone			0
that ’s how it should be			0
the day before a @entity7 the captain should be worrying about what ’s important to him			0
‘ that ’s making sure we ’re ready to try to win a series against @entity9			2
’ a glance at the @entity9 net session yesterday was an exercise in trying to put faces to names that are little known in the wider cricket world			0
this is an inexperienced home team and one that @entity13 really should defeat easily			0
yet the pitches will be slow and turgid , making it difficult for either side to take 20 wickets and @entity9 can clearly sense that @entity13 must be vulnerable			2
‘ we had a function the other night and it was made quite clear to us that @entity9 are here to fight and want to beat us 3 - 0 , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ they kept on calling it a war so we know we ’re in for a hell of a battle			0
’ one thing that has become clear under the new regime is that the @entity151 want to try to involve the many good brains of former captains , with @entity213 due to talk to the team last night and @entity215 due to make a presentation to @entity56 today ahead of his landmark @entity7			2
for now what comes next for @entity13 has to be pushed to one side			0
for @entity0 is facing a @entity7 series he has to win .			2

it has been an eventful few days since @entity13 arrived in the @entity106
despite the sacking of @entity19 , @entity0 is focused on test series
@entity13 take on the @entity9 in the first of three tests from monday
@entity24 hit an *aggressive* 170 for @entity127 against @entity129
@entity56 will make his 100th @entity7 outing on monday
@entity47 returns to the @entity7 line - up after the @entity93 series
