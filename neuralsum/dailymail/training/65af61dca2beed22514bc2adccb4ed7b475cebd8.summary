bowel ischaemia can lead to a 75 per cent loss of blood flow to the bowel			2
the 23 - year - old had taken two or four @entity5 tablets during the race , as well as sports supplements , but his preparation was described as ' entirely sensible '			1
at an inquest into his death , @entity35 and @entity37 coroner @entity36 said the combination of circumstances ' have never been recorded before '			1
the cause of death was contributed to by an ‘ idiosyncratic reaction ’ to hyperthermia , dehydration , endurance exertion , hyperosmolar sports supplements and ibuprofen , and his potassium levels were three times higher than normal levels			1
the inquest heard that he also used an inhaler for asthma but the coroner ruled that this did not contribute to his death			1
describing his body ’s reaction , ms @entity59 said it was a ‘ perfect storm ’ situation			1
‘ from the point of his collapse there was nothing that could have been done to help @entity3 , ' she said			2
‘ there is no evidence that any other death has occurred in the same circumstances as @entity3 ’s did			2
’ popular : mr @entity3 was raising cash for charity by running the @entity35 marathon , one of @entity80 's largest races recording a verdict of misadventure , she added : ‘ @entity3 died as a result of a combination of complications arising on a background of endurance sport			1
' this combination has never been recorded before and may never be recorded again			0
' ‘ @entity3 was unique in life and he remains unique in his death			0

fit as a fiddle : the 23 - year - old 's death was described by the coroner as unique			1
the young man did not ' indulge in risky behaviour ' ' he did n’t indulge in any risky behaviour			0

he was cared for by extraordinarily kind , compassionate people who could not have done more or tried harder to keep him alive			0
' @entity3 ’s death was described by the coroner as extraordinarily rare , but it is a tragic reminder that participation in any endurance event and taking gels and analgesics to help you get through it carry a level of risk , no matter how fit you are or how hard you train			2
' the endurance sports industry is still relatively new and we are all still learning about how the body copes and reacts to what we put it through and feed it			0
' we would urge all those involved in the industry to do what they can to ensure that everyone who participates does so knowing what they need to do and take to make the experience unforgettable for all the right reasons			0
