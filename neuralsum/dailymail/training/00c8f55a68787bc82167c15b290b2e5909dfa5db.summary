like a scene out of @entity6 , the sickening images of the oozing , putrid grease blocking @entity4 's sewers made even those with the strongest stomachs queasy			1
the stinking mass of lard , and much worse , highlighted @entity11 's love of cooking oil - and how we think nothing of throwing it down our sinks			2
now the double - decker sized blockage is getting worse , after experts discovered three tonnes had been added to the mass since its discovery last month			1
@entity21 : the mass of lard and other household waste has grown by a huge three tonnes since its discovery in the sewers of @entity4 despite engineers ' efforts to remove the then 15 ton mass and pleas from the water company , fresh grease is continuing to clog up our sewers			1
the blockage was so critical at one point it threatened to blast the covers off manholes in @entity40 with raw sewage			0
but @entity43 contracts supervisor @entity42 said a campaign for customers to bin their fat has done little to ease the problem			1
growing : despite pleas from @entity43 , customers are still getting rid of their cooking oil in their sinks rather than their bins he said : ' this sewer pipe collects the sewage from across most of @entity40 so it could be coming from anywhere			0
' old , congealed fat is white , but this was yellow in colour , so it ’s been put into the sewers over the last few weeks			0
' we ’ve spent a lot of time drawing attention to the dangers of putting fat down the drain , so i ca n’t imagine where these huge amounts are coming from			0
' @entity72 cost : the repair bills to fix problems caused by fat blockages in @entity4 have now reached £ 1million mr @entity42 adds : ' we need everyone to treat these sewers better			2
and that means one thing : @entity81 it - do n’t block it			1
' this issue is nothing new , but in the @entity85 , @entity43 spent £ 2 million a year removing fat from its network - that figure bulged to £ 12million in 2012			2
it 's not only disgarded cooking oil which is adding to the current batch of @entity92 , a 15 per cent annual rise in wet wipes has also been blamed - a product our @entity97 sewers can not deal with			1
@entity99 , a @entity43 spokesman , said : ‘ we are seeing an increasing trend across @entity11 of people using wet - wipes instead of loo roll			2
discovery : @entity43 workers were shocked to find the original 15 - ton blockage in august residents alerted engineers to the ' fatberg ' after they complained of not being able to flush their toilets ‘ our sewers are designed to take human waste and loo roll , and nothing else			1
' when a wipe goes down , it does n’t break down			0
manufacturers say they do eventually , but that ’s in a landfill site			0
in contrast , loo roll breaks down in seconds			0
‘ no moistened wipe has yet to come on the market that is acceptable to sewers			0

the huge amount of grease is added to the 15 - ton ' @entity21 ' which was discovered in @entity4 's sewers in august
the gunge blockage is the same size as three blue *whales*
@entity43 *bosses* to *launch* new campaign to ' @entity81 it - not block it '
