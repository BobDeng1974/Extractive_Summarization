by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 04:59 est , 7 august 2012 on the same day @entity1 makes a historic encounter with @entity3 , one of @entity6 's earliest rockets is setting it 's own truly historic record			0
in the last week , @entity8 , which floated into the heavens in 1977 , has signalled it has passed two of the ' key changes ' expected when it passes out of the furthest fringes of our solar system - a staggering 11,100,000,000 miles away			1
this is the furthest distance any man - made object has ever travelled - and on july 28th , it 's long and arduous journey was broken by cosmic changes			0
the @entity8 probe has been travelling towards the outer reaches of the solar system since 1977 - it has enough batteries to last until 2020 , scientists estimate the data received from the @entity8 , which travels at ten miles a second , on july 28th showed a five per cent spike in the level of high - energy cosmic rays			1
this implies the @entity8 is moving out of the heliosheath - the ' protective bubble ' around the solar system created from charged particles from the sun. on the same day , the level of lower - energy particles coming from within the solar system dropped by half			1
however , over the next three days , these levels returned to their previous amounts , giving @entity1 scientists a small mystery to study while they await for more information			0
for the past year , @entity8 used its instruments to explore the new region			0
it appeared to be the cosmic doldrums where solar winds streaming out from the sun at 1 million mph have dramatically eased @entity8 is now detecting the first traces of ' interstellar winds ' - the signs it is finally reaching the edges of solar system the third indicator that the @entity8 is leaving the solar system is the direction of the magnetic field , and this is now being studied by @entity1			1
once all signals have been passed , @entity1 can confirm the @entity8 is on to the final frontier , and they expect to provide a preliminary report on the magnetic fields next month			1
voyager project scientist @entity74 said : ' these are thrilling times for the @entity76 as we try to understand the quickening pace of changes as @entity8 approaches the edge of interstellar space			0
' we are certainly in a new region at the edge of the solar system where things are changing rapidly			2
but we are not yet able to say that @entity8 has entered interstellar space			0
' voyager 1 and its twin , @entity89 , were launched in 1977 to tour the outer planets including @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 video : at the edge of the solar system , @entity8 reports a sharp increase in cosmic rays ...			2

@entity8 passes two out of three ' key changes ' for *escaping* solar system
@entity1 expected to report on third vital test next month
