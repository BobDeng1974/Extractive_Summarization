a gp surgery tried to ban its own patients from posting negative comments about the practice on social media			1
a poster at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , warned patients that criticisms could be treated as a breach of its ' zero tolerance policy ' against abusive treatment if posted on @entity15 and @entity16			1
the request was made after staff allegedly saw bad language used to describe the surgery 's standard of care on a @entity15 page			1
' do not use social media sites , @entity15 / @entity16			1
' any comments we see on social media sites may be seen as a breach of our zero tolerance policy			2
' we are happy to deal with your comments / complaints in the usual way			2
' practice manager @entity50 said the sign had been changed and now says : ' this ensures we can respond to people 's concerns with patient confidentiality in mind '			1
@entity57 , chief executive of @entity58 which gathers healthcare feedback from people all over the @entity61 said : ' we believe people should be able to share and explore good and not so good feedback , and also to leave feedback on their personal experiences across the entire spectrum of healthcare			0
' we know that capturing this type of experience and sharing it openly and transparently will lead to patient empowerment			0
' it will highlight excellence but also highlight where there is poor practice			2
it 's really important from a patients point of view in order for them to make an informed decision			0
' i absolutely think that patients are more likely to give a more open and honest opinion on social media or in forums where they are speaking with their peers			0
' the @entity88 zero tolerance policy states ' any act of aggression , violence or intimidation , both physical and non-physical from any member of staff , patient , visitor or member of the public is unacceptable			0
' as an organisation , we are committed to introducing measures , through the @entity88 and relevant guidelines , to reduce risk and to have procedures in place that will enable staff to manage appropriately an aggressive or violent situation should it arise			0
' the surgery warned any comments posted on @entity15 and @entity16 could be considered a breach of its zero tolerance policy towards abusive treatment of staff ( picture posed by models ) ms @entity50 said they put the sign up after staff discovered personal comments using bad language about themselves online			1
' those sort of comments and that sort of language is a form of bullying , ' she said			0
' we would much rather people come and see us in person if they have something they want to say			0
' we ca n't respond to people properly if they choose to make their comments on @entity15 or @entity16			1
' @entity6 refused to comment when contacted by @entity130 this afternoon .			2
