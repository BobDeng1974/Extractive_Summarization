the 32 - year - old , who has 156 international caps and 57 goals to his name , has been left out by coach @entity9 , but @entity11 's struggling striker @entity10 has been selected			1
it means @entity0 will not get the chance to play in his fourth @entity3 - a record that would have put him alongside @entity15 and @entity16 - a tournament in which he has scored as many goals as @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 combined			1

' but again , my sincerest apologies to everyone who was offended			0
' another midfielder who did n't make the squad was @entity70 of the @entity58 - though he had a rather more humorous reaction when informed			0

regardless , i will be cheering on my friends and teammates this summer , and i remain committed to helping grow soccer in the @entity90 in the years to come			0
