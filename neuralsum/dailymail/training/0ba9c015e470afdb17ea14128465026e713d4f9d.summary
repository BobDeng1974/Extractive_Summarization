by @entity0 ' arrogance ' : @entity2 commissioner for @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 says @entity7 politicians are pandering to prejudices and ignoring the benefits migrants bring @entity12 is ‘ pandering ’ to xenophobes by seeking to limit the number of migrants from the @entity2 – and the price to pay will be a rise in @entity7 taxes , the @entity11 will say today			1
in an outspoken assault on the government ’s demands to curb the free movement of people , @entity24 – the @entity26 employment commissioner – said @entity27 has been given ‘ no evidence ’ that benefits tourism is a widespread problem			1
he accuses @entity7 of an ‘ inappropriate over-reaction ’ to the lifting of transition controls on @entity35 and @entity36			1
and in a calculated rebuff to the prime minister , he will say that it is impossible for @entity7 to rewrite the free movement of workers around @entity42 – a key plank of the mr @entity12 ’s plans to renegotiate the @entity7 ’s relationship with @entity27 ahead of a referendum in 2017			2
in a speech at the @entity48 mr @entity24 will say politicians are avoiding the ‘ inconvenient truth ’ that the ‘ vast majority ’ of migrants move to work and are an ‘ asset ’ to economies like the @entity7 ’s with an ageing population			1
he will say : ‘ politicians should be responsible enough to talk about facts , rather than to pander to prejudice , or in the worst cases , xenophobia			1
‘ the truth , and indeed it might be inconvenient for some , is that they do n’t do it in order to claim benefits			0
these workers are in fact of considerable benefit to the economies , and to the welfare systems , of the receiving countries			0
’ mr @entity24 will add : ‘ in the specific case of the @entity7 , public debt would be much higher in the future without immigration because of the ageing population			1
do people in the @entity7 really want to pay higher taxes instead of immigration ? ’ the government has already tightened the rules to limit the ‘ pull factors ’ in the benefits system which ministers believe has enticed @entity84 migrants to the @entity7			1
@entity85 ( left ) , the @entity86 chairman , says @entity7 is trying to ' get a grip ' on its borders			2
mr @entity24 's comments are a swipe at mr @entity12 ’s wider reform drive new migrants from the @entity93 will no longer be able to get housing benefit from april 2014 and they wo n’t be able to claim income - based @entity95 ( @entity95 ) until they have been in the country for three months			1
and those who pass an @entity97 , will only be able to get @entity95 for six months			0
but mr @entity24 will say he is yet to see evidence of widespread benefit tourism			2
he will add : ‘ in the case of the @entity7 , i have been asking for such evidence to back up their claims for over two years but all that we have received is a series of anecdotes about cases of criminal fraud and vicars performing sham marriages			2
’ in a direct swipe at mr @entity12 ’s wider reform drive , mr @entity24 will say freedom of movement is ‘ just one of the four freedoms on which the @entity2 ’s @entity117 is based , along with free movement of goods , capital and services			0
member @entity123 can not cherry pick which of the freedoms they want and leave the rest			0
’ the speech , which was briefed to journalists in advance , sparked fury last night			0
@entity86 chairman @entity85 said : ‘ why mr @entity24 thinks it ’s his job to criticise the government ’s actions to get a grip of our borders is beyond me			0
a source close to work and pensions secretary @entity137 added : ‘ these attempts to interfere in the @entity7 welfare state are frankly tiresome			0
’ @entity86 mp @entity140 said : this intervention typifies the arrogance , remoteness and lack of accountability of the @entity11			0

@entity24 says benefits tourism is not the problem @entity7 believes it is
he calls @entity7 's reaction to lifting of border controls ' inappropriate '
@entity24 said @entity154 ' pander ' to prejudice and should focus on facts
