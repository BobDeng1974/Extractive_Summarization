by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 4 november 2013 @entity2 : 03:16 est , 5 november 2013 it 's national dress but you 'd be forgiven for failing to realise it			0
but while the majority managed to make their mermaid , the @entity7 and @entity8 inspired outfits look glamorous , the same could n't be said for the bizarre creation worn by the @entity15 's @entity14			1
eschewing traditional stars and stripes , miss @entity14 instead chose a strange catsuit that appeared to have been inspired by the @entity20 franchise , @entity19			1
by contrast , @entity22 's @entity21 looked to history for her gown and ended up with a mishmash of @entity28 royal splendour and @entity29 on tour			2
she was appearing in the @entity83 , the first in a series of events leading up to the final of the @entity89 pageant which concludes on the 9th november in the @entity91 city of @entity92 , and the only one to insist on patriotic dress			1
what transpired was less patriotic dress and more style world tour , as contestants drew upon everything from natural phenomena to history and geography to create their look			0
among those looking to the past was @entity43 , who chose a @entity8 - inspired get - up , which came complete with a sequinned armour - plated bodice and a silver sword			2
bizarre though @entity110 's look was , she at least managed to make an effort which is more than could be said for miss @entity63 who appeared in an insipid blue crop top and skirt combination , that appeared to be inspired by @entity117 's @entity116			1
@entity118 : @entity120 's @entity119 chose an ensemble inspired by @entity122 carnival : @entity125 's @entity124 plumped for a @entity127 gown and mask for the event patriotic : miss @entity131 , @entity133 , wore a dress inspired by the @entity7 traditional : @entity136 's @entity135 and @entity138 's @entity137 both appeared in gorgeously colourful ensembles that clearly referenced their home nation inspired by the sea ? the inspiration for @entity145 ' @entity144 outfit is n't entirely clear glamorous : @entity147 's @entity146 plumped for a surprisingly elegant red , white and black outfit colourful : miss @entity150 , @entity152 , wore a traditional red and white dress eye - catching : @entity155 's @entity154 plumped for a psychedelic ensemble , that included a feather - hemmed catsuit , an impressive amount of sequins and a flowing cape @entity161 also chose blue but referenced the @entity70 , or @entity66 , with her sequin - spangled ensemble			1
@entity60 's @entity59 , meanwhile , chose a garish black , red and gold outfit that inexplicably had a pair of huge golden rings hanging off the hem			0
@entity120 's contestant took inspiration from @entity122 rather than her home nation , and stepped out onto the runway in a black feathered dress , oversized headdress and demonic trident that appeared to have little in common with @entity120			0
@entity175 , from the @entity176 , did at least manage to choose something that referenced her home country			0
her blue ensemble appeared to be inspired by @entity180 and came complete with canals , embroidered tulips and a windmill			0
another who looked to her nation 's capital for her pageant gown was miss @entity131 , @entity133 , who chose a sparkling silver design inspired by @entity192 ' iconic @entity7			2
more inspiring were the looks that came from the @entity194 , with @entity135 , @entity136 , appearing in a luxury version of her country 's actual national dress , as did @entity138 's @entity137 who wore a geisha - inspired ensemble			0
while not every outfit hit the heights of @entity137 's , the remaining 85 contestants have a week to finesse their look before hitting the stage at the @entity89 finals on the 9th			0
last year 's winner , the @entity15 's @entity207 , will be on hand to pass on her crown while the judging panel includes @entity212 former model @entity211 , @entity214 fashion designer @entity213 and @entity216 frontman , @entity217			1
capital chic : the @entity176 ' @entity175 appeared in a silk and sequins version of @entity180 , complete with canals , tulips and a windmill that 's @entity225 ? while it 's unclear what inspired the dress of the @entity231 nation 's entrant , @entity232 , the origin of @entity235 's @entity234 was clear ballet : miss @entity238 @entity237 danced along the runway in @entity241 opulent : @entity243 , the contestant from @entity244 chose a glamorous black and gold outfit lady in red : @entity250 's @entity249 sparkles in a traditional crimson gown pretty : miss @entity252 , @entity254 , combines plenty of raffia with a bizarre rattle type accessory homegrown talent : @entity91 's @entity259 in an elaborately bejewelled gown looking good : miss @entity261 , @entity263 , in a colourful ensemble on the catwalk in @entity241 impressive : both @entity266 and @entity267 chose to sport heavily feathered , sequinned and otherwise embellished ensembles on the runway deity : @entity273 's @entity272 looked like one of her country 's pantheon of goddesses in her striking red sequinned skirt , gold headdress and plentiful jewellery			1

the @entity15 's @entity14 was the source of a *contretemps* caused by her bizarre @entity19 - inspired look
also plumping for an unusual outfit was the @entity38 's @entity21 who chose an @entity28 design
other gowns were inspired by the @entity7 , the @entity66 and @entity117 's @entity65 statue
the gowns appeared at the @entity293 in the @entity91 city of @entity92
the final round of the pageant takes place on the 9th november and will be judged by @entity216 's @entity217
