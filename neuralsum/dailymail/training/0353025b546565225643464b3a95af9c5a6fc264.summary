' it was a bit of a shock and my heart did miss several beats when i saw it for the first time			2
a @entity23 visitor to @entity27 took photographs of the suitcases and researched the names @entity11 's mother @entity15 ( left ) and a family photograph taken in 1930 with @entity11 's sister @entity82 ' this is the first evidence i have ever had that my mother , my father and my grandmother actually arrived at @entity5			1

' in the last message in october 1944 my father stated that they expected to move east			2
we knew what he meant because east meant the extermination camps in @entity23			1
@entity11 in @entity139 uniform taken 1946 as a lieutenant ' in a way my sister and i had come to expect this news			1

' before the end of the war mr @entity11 had built up such a hatred of his homeland that he volunteered to join the @entity54 army			1
