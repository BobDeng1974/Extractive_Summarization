by @entity0 last updated at 11:35 am on 8th february 2012 reboot and refresh : the new @entity5 - @entity4 title will be the first in a series to include modern touches in the 1960s comic they were stories created in an era when phones were attached to hooks , faces were in books and the only tweets were the ones coming from birds in trees			1
however the modern touches which are so commonplace in today 's digital age are to make their debut - in @entity22			1
the @entity5 comic book , which was created in the 1960s , is the first to be modernised in a makeover promising to ' blow the cobwebs off a story that 's decades old '			1
mobile phones , tablet pcs , the @entity30 and @entity31 are all to feature in ' tweaked ' versions of the classic comic in a bid by the publishers to connect younger generations with its 1960s titles			1
the @entity5 is the story of a science genius , his girlfriend , her hot - shot brother and a football player - turned - accomplished pilot , who are exposed to cosmic rays in space and return to @entity46 with super powers			1
the origin of the story is being updated this week in a sleeker tale dubbed ' season one ' with a more contemporary vibe , while sticking to the roots of @entity54 , @entity55 , brother @entity56 , and @entity57 - who have otherwise been known for the past 51 years as mr. @entity54 , @entity55 , the @entity56 and the @entity57			1
the revision is part of @entity22 's push to add modern touches to its characters			1
@entity22 also is bringing a modern spin to the origins of its other classic characters this year in similar ' @entity4 ' editions , including @entity67 , @entity68 and the x-men			1
@entity70 , who edits the publisher 's @entity5 lines of books , said : ' the aim is definitely to continue to keep these characters relevant in an ever - changing world , but also to tell a new story set within this time frame , not merely recount or retell comics that other people have previously done			1
' we tweaked elements where it made sense			2
everybody in the ` @entity4 ' books has a cell phone , for example , but we tried to maintain the spirit of the seminal stories that these tales are built upon			2
' @entity92 , a playwright and tv writer whose credits include ' glee ' along with several stories for @entity22 , said ' @entity5 : season one ' was not a reboot of the classic origin , penned by @entity100 and drawn by @entity101			2
what a @entity22 : the comic book publisher is planning on giving some of its other titles a modern spin he added : ' it 's more of a ... refresh			2
the world 's changed over the last 50 years			2
how we tell comic stories , how we absorb them , so let 's update a great concept by setting it in the present			2
by giving it a contemporary sensibility			0
' artist @entity118 , whose first published comic work ' syndrome ' came out in 2010 , likened it to reintroducing classic stories to modern audiences			0
he said : ' the storytelling techniques we use as creators and the expectations of readers have changed since the @entity129 's origins were first told			0
' and because of this , it can be hard for people who did n't grow up accustomed to the @entity134 style to find these stories as exciting and inspiring as those of us who did			0
' @entity138 said the idea is to make the characters more relevant to a reader who navigates social media , consumes information and is fluent in not just pop culture , but entertainment of all stripes			0
modern makeover : @entity148 in the high - tech 2005 film @entity5 , based on the original 1960s comic he added : ' another example , and it 's just a little thing , but the @entity5 - after their ill - fated debut battling the @entity155 - are @entity30 sensations			0
' and @entity56 , annoyingly , is burning up @entity31			1
again , it 's little details like that , which do n't alter the fundamental dna of the @entity5 , but blow the cobwebs off a story that 's decades old			0
and have a slightly more pop flavor			0
' ultimately , however , no matter the year - be it 1961 or 2012 - the objective is creating a fresh and invigorating story with characters that have been a bedrock for @entity22			0
@entity118 added : ' this was my first big project at @entity22 , and it gave me a chance to draw characters i have been in love with since i first started reading comics as a kid			0
' i really had to up my game to show everyone at @entity22 that i could do justice to @entity92 's script , not to mention the high bar set by @entity100 and @entity101			0
