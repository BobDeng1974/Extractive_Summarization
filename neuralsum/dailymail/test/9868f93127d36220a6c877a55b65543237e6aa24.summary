revenues declined to £ 217.2million in the period , down by almost £ 100million			0
@entity5 's executive chairman @entity14 said : ' we know it will take time to repair our reputation and gain an accepted place in the financial services industry , but we 're determined to deliver on our plans and serve our customers in the right way			2
' hundreds of payday lenders , such as @entity5 , will be wiped out by tougher rules designed to protect customers , experts have predicted the @entity28 watchdog has forecast that just three or four payday lenders out of 400 will be left standing following the introduction of the rules in january			1
they include a daily interest cap of 0.8 per cent and stricter affordability checks to ensure customers can repay loans			0
the true picture should become clearer later this year , as the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) attempts to weed out dodgy firms			0
payday lenders have all had to apply for a license to trade and will learn in the coming months whether they have been successful			1

the cap on the cost of loans has reduced @entity5 ’s annual interest rate from 5,853per cent to 1,509 per cent since the changes were enforced in january			0
