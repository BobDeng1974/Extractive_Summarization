today , she will travel to @entity1 in @entity2 to present @entity3 with their new standard			1
next week , princess @entity5 will travel the length and breadth of the @entity8 , starting the week with a livestock sale in @entity10 and ending it with three engagements in @entity13			1
' the apple never falls far from the tree and @entity5 has had two very good royal role models in her parents , ' she explains			1
' none of them has ever craved the limelight , even though they all understand the importance of using their public profile to highlight the causes they support			0
' in this , plain - speaking @entity5 has few equals and makes regular , if rare , contributions to public debate , most controversially on the subject of horses			1
speaking at the annual conference of @entity53 , of which the 64 - year - old is president , she caused outrage when she suggested that ' attitudes towards the horse meat trade may need to change '			0
noting that horse neglect is almost unheard of in @entity59 where horse meat is legal , she added : close : princess @entity5 is famously close to her parents and insiders say she gets her work ethic from them still working : the @entity63 , pictured here at the @entity64 , is still working at 93 ' if that is true then , and they value their horses and they look after them well because they are in the horse meat trade , should we be considering a real market for horse meat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases ? ' i just chuck that out there for what it 's worth because it needs a debate			1
we have to understand if value has a part to play in how we reduce welfare cases … ' if it [ the horse ] has real financial value then you look a little bit further ahead in the way you look after your animals			0
' such a practical approach is typical of the princess royal , who has a country - woman 's clear - eyed view of livestock , all while owning a much - loved herd of horses - among them a former abuse case that she re-homed			1
the same approach can be seen in her philanthropic work of which she does a considerable amount , albeit mostly unrecorded			1
' the power of the princess royal ’s support is that she genuinely understands the issues we aim to address , ' says @entity113 of @entity114 , an organisation that aims to provide finance to would - be entrepreneurs in some of the world 's poorest countries			2
close : as well as being close to the @entity119 , princess @entity5 is also popular with her three brothers duty : according to royal insiders , @entity5 , pictured as a baby , takes inspiration from her parents ' her knowledge of the difficulties facing men and women living in poverty is impressive and brings real gravitas to our charity			1
' she is an important ambassador for our work and supports both what we do and how we do it			2
it is not a superficial relationship in any way			0
' that she puts so much effort into each charity she supports is all the more impressive given that her current list of philanthropic patronages totals 332			2
these range from the @entity146 to @entity147 and the @entity148			0
many require travel ; the most recent being a flying visit to @entity152 and @entity153 where she toured projects run by @entity155 , another charity of which @entity5 is president			1
' she has huge knowledge of our history and work , going back to our founder @entity160 , ' says ceo @entity161 , who has worked with the princess royal for many years			1
' over the years she has visited our programmes in some of the remotest and toughest parts of the world from @entity152 to @entity166 as well as inspiring our volunteers and supporters here at home			0
' she passionately believes that all children should have a chance to fulfil their potential and that the cornerstone of the work of @entity155 is our local staff			2
' interests : she has a huge range of interests and works with @entity155 among others busy : next week @entity5 , pictured arriving at the @entity182 embassy last year , will criss - cross the @entity8 work : last week saw her count the @entity183 among her many visits involved : nevertheless , those who work with her such as the @entity186 , say she is very involved @entity5 spent much of her @entity152 tour meeting locals , according to @entity161 , who says her down - to - earth approach never fails to impress			1
' her willingness to roll up her sleeves means she gets a front line view of the challenges children face , ' he adds			0
' i remember accompanying her on a visit to a slum in @entity198 when she decided to jump across open sewers to get to a health clinic and meet our midwives and nurses			0
' she also has a special way of not patronising children , asking them serious questions and getting serious answers			0
' the same easygoing attitude is also characteristic of her many @entity8 visits			2
' she has a great sense of humour , ' says @entity211 of @entity212			2
' she always puts the carers she meets at their ease and is genuinely interested in their stories and how we can continue to improve support for them			0
' amusing : @entity5 also has a sense of humour , as prince @entity221 's reaction ( left ) proves , and she is close to @entity222 all together : along with @entity222 , @entity223 and his wife @entity224 also live on @entity5 's @entity225 hands - on : @entity5 is an involved grandmother and has been pictured with one - year - old @entity228 several times loved : @entity5 is now grandmother to three granddaughters , @entity223 ( pictured , now four ) , @entity230 and @entity228 @entity211 , who has worked with the princess royal for more than 20 years , says @entity5 does n't get the recognition she deserves			1
' her charity work is well known within our field but outside , while people think that @entity237 is hard working royal , they are probably not aware of just how involved she is			2
' @entity238 , however , suspects that what @entity5 really wants is to get on with her work with as little fuss as possible			1
' my personal perspective is that rather than seeking coverage for her work , she enjoys really exploring the issues that the charity is dealing with , ' he explains			2
' she does not seek personal publicity , ' adds @entity211			0
' she should be allowed to also have a life with her family away from the media			0
' both of her children , @entity253 and @entity223 , with whom she shares a passion for all things equine , live on her @entity257 in @entity258			0
she is also thought to be a hands - on grandmother to her three granddaughters , @entity230 , @entity223 and @entity228 , and has been pictured looking after her youngest granddaughter while @entity222 pursues her own career in eventing			0
easygoing : princess @entity5 meeting locals in @entity266 with @entity114 clever : @entity5 visits an @entity114 project involving mushroom farming in @entity266 supportive : princess @entity5 meets a group of full - time carers at a @entity186 tea party nevertheless , her work often takes her away from them for long periods , with @entity5 criss - crossing the country like a campaigning politician			1
in the first week of february alone , she will spend two days in @entity279 , two in @entity281 and one in @entity283 , before visiting various parts of @entity285 and @entity286 the following week			1
along with spending three days in @entity281 , the second week of february will also take her back to @entity279 where she will watch a rugby match as part of her role as patron of @entity292			1
to those who know her , this seemingly inexhaustible ability to keep on working come what may and regardless of personal inclination is no surprise			0
' @entity5 is the rock of the royal family , ' adds @entity28			1
' she 's got her feet firmly on the ground , she cherishes tradition and champions solid family values			0
' she is never going to be thought of as the most popular but she is the one most people would say is doing a good job			0
and in my opinion , she is			0

princess @entity5 is patron of 332 charities and does up to 20 visits a week
today , she visits @entity1 to present a new standard
next week will start at a @entity279 livestock fair and end in @entity13
insiders say she has the same sense of duty and work ethic as the @entity119
