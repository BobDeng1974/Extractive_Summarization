snack tactics : knowing where to order your french fries can make all the difference to your waistline whether loaded with chili and cheese , or served simply with lashings of salt , the humble french fry is undoubtedly @entity13 's favourite deep - fried treat			1
but knowing where to order the popular snack can make all the difference to your waistline , as a new book reveals that servings can vary wildly in terms of fat and calorie content			2
researchers for @entity23 ! 2013 : the @entity24 found that one portion can differ by as many as 1,200 calories			1
@entity28 's french fries were surprisingly among the healthiest on offer at 230 calories and 11g of fat per small serving , however a plate of @entity35 's @entity34 is a serious diet - buster at 2,150 calories , with a staggering 144g of fat and 6,080mg sodium			1
loaded fries are n't all bad though - if yours are n't complete without a layer of melted cheese , then head to @entity45 instead , where a small @entity46 comes in at a rather less terrifying 360 calories and 20g fat			2
thicker - cut steak fries are the safest way to play it on a restaurant menu , the @entity23 team reveals , as the higher ratio of potato to oil cuts the fat content down significantly			1
that does not appear to be the case at @entity60 's though , as the chain 's @entity61 have almost double the fat of its regular fries at 49g and 660 calories			1
serving size : @entity28 's french fries ( left ) were surprisingly among the healthiest on offer at 230 calories and 11g of fat per small serving , while @entity71 ' huge portions ( right ) mean there are 1,474 calories in a large instead , choose @entity75 's potato wedges , at 290 calories and 15g of fat , just 2.5g of which is saturated			1
novelty value : @entity80 serves the lowest - calorie curly fries @entity83 editor - in - chief @entity82 , who is behind the @entity23 series , told @entity85 that the trick to having your fries and eating them is to exercise moderation			1
' the occasional order of fries is n’t so bad , but most people treat deep - fried potatoes like a food group , ' he said			0
' one out of every six restaurant orders comes with fries , and more than 50per cent of @entity13 potatoes pass through a deep fryer before being sold			0
when researchers look at the effect of this , it becomes clear that there ’s a direct connection between french fries and weight gain			0
' the new guide also compared sweet potato fries , which many might believe is a healthier alternative			2
the exact opposite is the case at the @entity112 , however , where a portion of sweet potato fries is 400 calories more than its regular fries			1
@entity117 @entity28 ’s is awfully proud of its fries			1
so proud , in fact , that the chain bought the rights to be the exclusive fry purveyor at the @entity124 in @entity125			0
and perhaps it should be proud - the spuds taste great and they have fewer calories than any other fast food chain ’s			0
@entity71 is also proud of its fries , but that pride manifests itself in elephantine portions that threaten to tip your table and will most certainly tip your bathroom scale			1
best : @entity28 's @entity137 ( small ) @entity138 : five @entity139 ( large ) loaded fries let ’s be frank : topping fries with cheese , ranch , bacon , gravy , sour cream , or any similar high - fat accoutrement is the kind of innovation that turns skinny people chubby			1
but if you have a hankering you ca n’t control , just remember to keep the portion in check			0
fortunately @entity45 gives you that option : order the chain ’s small over the loaded fries at @entity35 and you ’ll eliminate 1,790 calories			2
best : steak ‘ n @entity162 ( small ) @entity138 : @entity35 's @entity34 steak fries wedges tend to be a smarter option : you pack more soft potato inside each greasy exterior , which ultimately leads to fewer calories for the same amount of food			1
but that does n’t mean you do n’t still have to consider portion size			0
opt for @entity75 ’s over @entity60 ’s and you ’ll cut the calories by more than half			0
best : @entity75 @entity179 @entity138 : @entity60 friday 's @entity61 @entity180 think you ’re saving yourself calories by opting for sweet potatoes over standard spuds ? think again			2
a side of @entity112 ’s fries will run you 400 calories more than their regular fries and stick you with nearly 50 percent more carbohydrates than a can of @entity191			0
switch to @entity193 ’s fries and you ’ll cut more than two - thirds of the calories			0
best : @entity197 ( small ) @entity138 : @entity198 curly fries its menu once clotted with trans fats , @entity80 has made a concerted effort in recent years to cut down on dangerous oils			0
what remains is a dramatically improved side dish lineup , including your best option for a novelty fry			0
@entity209 ’s , on the other hand , seasons every order with more than half a teaspoon of salt			0
best : @entity214 ( small ) @entity138 : @entity209 ’s @entity215 ( large ) source : @entity23			2

the new @entity23 guide reveals that a single portion can vary by as many as 1,200 calories
