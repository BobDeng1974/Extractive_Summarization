@entity0 is prepared to forgive and forget when he faces the man who criticised his groundbreaking appointment of a female coach last summer			1
the @entity5 no 1 ’s second - round opponent at the @entity6 will be local hope @entity7 , who expressed some fairly unreconstructed macho views when @entity0 teamed up with @entity10 after the @entity11			1
asked what he thought of the idea , the @entity12 known as ‘ @entity13 ’ declared publicly what some of his peers or former players were only prepared to say in private			2
@entity0 beat @entity23 qualifier @entity21 in the @entity6 first round on monday @entity0 beat @entity21 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 in a laboured straight - sets victory ‘ i could n’t do it because i do n’t think that highly of the women ’s game , ’ he commented			1
‘ it ’s all equal rights these days , politically correct			0
someone ’s got to give it a go , but it wo n’t be me			0
’ now @entity0 has set up their first encounter since @entity7 brought the furies on himself			1
it is his reward for a sometimes laboured 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 victory over @entity23 qualifier @entity21			1
the world no 6 does not bear a grudge after @entity7 , with whom he has always got on well , swiftly moved to make amends last year			1
‘ he came and spoke to me immediately about it when it was in the papers and apologised , and spoke to my mum about it and apologised , and apologised to @entity10 , ’ revealed @entity0			2
the @entity5 no 1 takes on local hope @entity7 in the second round @entity7 said he did n't think highly enough of the women 's game to hire a female coach after @entity0 appointed @entity10 last year ‘ he ’s the sort of guy , he can say something and he does n’t necessarily mean anything bad with it if that ’s his opinion			1
if he does n’t want to work with a female coach then that ’s absolutely fine and that ’s the case with many players			0
i ’m not offended by it and i get on absolutely fine with him			0
’ the extrovert @entity7 , 29 , let out an animalistic scream when he finally edged out @entity64 @entity63 in a deciding fifth set , but insists he is mellowing and trying to avoid controversy			2
‘ i guess i ’m definitely maturing in my old age , i ’m a late bloomer , ’ he said			0
‘ i guess mentally-wise i ’m a late developer in that department as well			0
’ he described @entity0 ’s skill levels as ‘ probably second only to @entity70 ( @entity71 ) ’ and that is why the @entity74 ’s subtle ability to break down an opponent will probably prove too much for him when they meet			2
@entity10 watch on as @entity0 safely progresses through the first round @entity7 collapses to the floor in celebration after beating @entity63 in his first round one of the many fascinating questions to be answered this year is whether the @entity12 ’s original take on the @entity10 arrangement proves to be correct or if she can coax @entity0 back to the heights achieved with @entity85			1
they have had a chance to work together in @entity88 and , judging by yesterday , have altered his service action with particular reference to the ball toss which was a nagging issue through 2014			0
what does not appear to have changed is @entity0 ’s tendency to show frustration and communicate angrily with himself when things are not working out , as they sometimes failed to do against @entity21			2
@entity0 admitted this is a natural tendency , saying : ‘ when things do n’t go people ’s way , it ’s normal			2
if i went to play five - a - side football with my dad ’s friends and someone misplaces a pass , everyone ’s reaction when they do something wrong is to want to say something			0
@entity111 6 @entity0 shakes hand with his opponent after the victory on monday @entity0 signs autographs for fans in @entity117 after the straight - set win ‘ it ’s about making sure you are n't letting those things affect you ... it ’s not something that necessarily comes naturally to everyone			1
’ @entity0 feels his back is now in such good shape and he looks to be moving as well as ever			0
it is difficult to see @entity7 piercing his defences			0
they actually met the week before last at the @entity130 in @entity131 , with no ranking points at stake , and @entity0 won easily			0
but , as his demeanour against @entity135 sometimes showed — he needed to recover from 1 - 4 in the third set — the pressures are very different in a @entity138 .			1
