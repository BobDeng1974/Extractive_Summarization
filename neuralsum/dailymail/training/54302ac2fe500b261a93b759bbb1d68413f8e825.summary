by @entity0 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity1 went all out in buying @entity2 for £ 10million , breaking their own record transfer fee and telling the world they 're deadly serious about not being sucked into a relegation battle			1
but plenty of questions have been asked since they bought the striker from @entity10			0
who is he ? what 's he done to be worth that kind of money ? will he adapt or just be another dud ? here , @entity16 gives you the lowdown on the 25 - year - old from @entity20			1
how did the £ 10m price - tag come about ? @entity22 to @entity23 - £ 4m @entity23 to @entity10 - £ 7m @entity10 to @entity1 - £ 10m at 25 , @entity25 's stock has risen over the years			1
the forward began with @entity27 , where he won the @entity28 , before venturing to @entity29 , as most aspiring youngsters would			0
the then - 20 - year - old joined @entity32 outfit @entity22 and , a failed trial at @entity35 side @entity34 along the way , made it to @entity38 with @entity23 , costing about £ 4m at the time			1
he 's upped his price as he goes along , particularly after joining @entity10 for £ 7m in 2011			1
there , he scored 33 goals in 74 games in the @entity44			0
@entity45 wanted to make a profit on their initial investment , and have done so with the £ 10m sale			2
signed : @entity2 has signed for @entity1 for £ 10million from @entity10 as their fifth new player @entity51 : @entity20 , october 10 1988 ( age 25 ) 2006 - 2007 : @entity27 ( 5 apps , 1 gl ) 2008 - 2010 : @entity22 ( 55 , 23 ) 2010 - 2011 : @entity23 ( 52 , 17 ) 2011 - 2014 : @entity10 ( 74 , 33 ) 2014 - now : @entity1 2010 - now : @entity20 ( 23 , 5 ) statistics based on league appearances			1
has he had his heart set on the @entity28 for a while ? yes , but not with @entity1			0
the striker actually preferred @entity61			2
in 2013 , he was rated at £ 9m and @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 were others on the chase			1
but last year , his agent @entity67 had this to say : ' there has been a lot of interest from @entity73 clubs , but @entity61 would be @entity2 's preferred choice for a number of reasons			1
' they have a good fan - base and play an attacking style of football			1
' he has a good knowledge of the club and of the @entity28			0
@entity2 would love to test himself at that level			2
' he 's got the chance now , just not at @entity86			0
wanted : @entity10 striker @entity2 attracted interest from several @entity28 clubs at the time how will he fit in ? @entity1 have been crying out for a powerful striker ever since @entity91 's loan spell came to an end , and they may find it in @entity94			1
he 's strong , fast - paced , particularly good in the air , and has proved himself in the @entity96 and internationally , too			1
the @entity1 teetered above relegation to the @entity98 last year , and @entity99 and @entity100 were their top goalscorers in a dismal @entity28 campaign on five			0
if @entity25 can adapt to @entity73 as he did to @entity103 , then he can be the goalscorer they crave			2
new boy : @entity2 took to @entity105 to announce the move and was excited to join the @entity28 excited : @entity2 wrote on @entity105 that it was a ' done deal ' and thanked @entity108 for the chance to join @entity1 will he be a dud or a success ? it 's always difficult to judge , but there are no worrying signs to indicate that he will be anything other than a success at the @entity117			2
some players instantly adapt to the @entity28 , others take time , and a few never do			0
but @entity2 seems a determined striker who 's been waiting for this chance for a while			2
when he moved to @entity32 , he admitted he struggled with the cold weather			0
however , he became enough of a handful to defenders to earn a move to @entity38			0
@entity1 have raised a few eyebrows with their spending on @entity25 , but time will tell if it was too impulsive or a stroke of genius			0
proud : @entity2 took to @entity105 to announce his deal with @entity1 and thanked his family and agents			0

@entity2 's stock has risen over his *career* to reach £ 10million price - tag
@entity2 wanted to sign for @entity61 last year for £ 9m as agent said ' they have a good fan - base and play an attacking style of football '
@entity25 has @entity96 and internationally experience
