by @entity0 published : 03:01 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 17:46 est , 8 april 2013 two women have been tortured for three days and then beheaded in a remote village in @entity3 after being accused of witchcraft			1
a team of police rushed to the scene - but were forced to stand by and watch the victims being decapitated with axes as locals refused to let them come to their aid			1
a large crowd kept the police at bay within sight of the clearing where the women were lying trussed up on the ground			1
villagers on the island of @entity20 ignored orders to let them go , and instead set about them with axes and knives			0
villagers : residents of the island of @entity20 have executed two women for witchcraft ( other locals are pictured in this file photo ) brutal : in february , a young woman was burnt alive on a pile of tyres ( pictured ) for allegedly killing a boy the women , from the village of @entity35 , were accused of using sorcery to kill a popular schoolteacher who died a few weeks ago			1
' we could n't do anything to help these two women , ' said @entity20 police chief @entity40			1
' my men were threatened when they went to the area to negotiate the release of the women			2
we could n't do anything to help them because of the threats made against us			0
' he said the mob had burned down houses in the women 's village , forcing their relatives to flee into the jungle			1
' these killings were both barbaric and senseless , ' mr @entity40 said			0
remote : the killings happened in a small village located on the island of @entity20 sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in @entity3 and is commonly practiced in remote villages across the island nation			1
the cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 new @entity3 kina ( £ 303 ) , plus a pig and a bag of rice , in 1971 , whilst still a colony , the country introduced a @entity75 to criminalise the practice			1
however the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused of black magic , such as that on @entity83 , and convictions by ‘ kangaroo courts ’ made up of of local village elders			2
as a result the @entity3 law reform commission proposing to repeal the law			2
last july , 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and use their genitals for sorcery rituals			0
in 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘ kangaroo court ’ convicted him of sorcery			0
the gruesome murders follow a number of sorcery - related killings on the @entity3 mainland , mostly in remote highland villages			1
earlier this year a young woman accused of being a witch and causing the death of a young boy was dragged to a rubbish dump and burned alive , with police once again unable to help because of threats by the crowd			2
' i wish we could have helped these two women , ' said mr @entity40 in a reference to the latest killings			0
' but the villagers who had kidnapped the women were armed with five high - powered firearms , knives and axes			0
' he told the @entity128 newspaper that the two women were attacked at their village homes at night and taken to the nearby village of @entity131 , where the mob accused them of practicing sorcery and bringing about the death of the teacher			1
they were tortured for three days and nights , receiving numerous knife wounds , before being dragged out to a clearing to face execution			2
learning of the imminent murders , police desperately tried to bring in mediators , but all efforts to prevent the deaths failed			0
' we did not want to resort to force as the whole situation could have turned nasty with more lives at stake , ' mr @entity40 said			0
' even so , i 'm disgusted with my officers for failing to find a way of stopping these people who showed utter disregard to law and justice			0
' while they might well have been threatened , those police should have tried harder from the very beginning			0
