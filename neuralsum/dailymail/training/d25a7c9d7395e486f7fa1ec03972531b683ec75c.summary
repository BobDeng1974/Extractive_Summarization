@entity9 had intervened just a fortnight before the publication of this summer ’s results , to curtail grade inflation			1
the revelation will pile more pressure on education secretary @entity29 – accused of washing his hands of ‘ all responsibility ’ in the grading row			0
meanwhile teachers called for @entity9 ’s chief regulator , @entity34 , who appears before the @entity35 today , to quit			1
the @entity3 grading row erupted on august 23 , as furious teachers claimed thousands taking exams with various boards had unfairly missed out on cs			0

test : the revelation will pile more pressure on education secretary @entity29 now letters between @entity9 and exam board @entity11 , seen by the @entity49 , reveal summer grading decisions were overruled at the 11th hour			1
@entity9 ’s director of standards , @entity51 , wrote to @entity11 on august 7 , concerned that the board was about to award results for gcse @entity3 that would see the proportion of pupils with grade cs rise eight percentage points above the statistical prediction			1
he called on the board to act ‘ quickly ’ and ‘ produce outcomes that are much closer to the predictions ’			0
he said : ‘ this may require you to move grade boundary marks further than might normally be required			0
’ @entity11 replied the following day , stating that it had considered the issues raised by @entity9 but still felt its proposed grades were ‘ fair ’			1
however , the letter added that if @entity9 still required a change , the board could move the minimum requirement for a c grade in one of the gcse english units up to 65 marks out of 96 – up ten from january ’s 55 - mark grade boundary			1
in @entity9 ’s august 9 reply , mr @entity51 stated that the board was obliged to ensure its results were consistent with others that were close enough to predictions			1
