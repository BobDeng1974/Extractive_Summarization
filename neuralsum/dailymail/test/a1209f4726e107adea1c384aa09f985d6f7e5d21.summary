a video showing a man cracking a giant egg to reveal another fully formed egg inside , may be enough to scramble your brain			1
@entity8 user @entity6 cracked open the over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens , exclaiming : ‘ the big egg has another normal egg in it ! ’ while the instance is extremely rare , it ’s caused when the hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte – the ovum or egg cell that becomes the yolk of the egg – is released too soon			1
he then cracks the smaller egg , which also has a yolk and white inside			2
‘ that ’s the end of the nesting dolls of egg … an egg inside of an egg … crazy man , ’ he said , before noting that the yolks look rich			0
egg - citing : in the video , ‘ @entity6 ’ cracks the egg ( pictured ) , which is double the size of a normal one , to find a standard - sized egg inside , along with yolk and white			1
the unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction this is when a second oocyte ( yolk ) is released by the hen 's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid			1
when the second oocyte ’s released , the first is in the eggshell - gland portion of the oviduct , were the shell is made			2
it ’s thought that a shock , or stress causes a contraction , forcing first egg to reverse its course			0
this means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte , which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell , creating a giant egg around the first one			1
the unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction			0
a hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours , @entity84 explained			0
usually , the oocyte travels down the oviduct , adding layers of the egg until it ’s laid through the hen ’s vent			2
but in a counter-peristalsis contraction , a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey			2
when the second oocyte ’s released , the first is in the eggshell - gland portion of the oviduct , were the shell is made			0
it ’s thought that a shock , or stress causes a contraction , forcing first egg to reverse its course			0
this means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte , which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell , creating a giant egg around the first one			1
the phenomenon has been mentioned as far back as 1250 ad by the @entity115 friar and polymath @entity117 in his book @entity119			0
ask the egg - spert : in a counter-peristalsis contraction , a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey			1
this results in an egg with another made inside it , producing two yolks ( pictured )			0

unusual egg was *captured* on *camera* by @entity29 @entity8 user @entity6
shows him cracking the giant egg to reveal a normal sized one inside
phenomenon is caused when an oocyte - which becomes a yolk - is released too soon and *merges* with an earlier egg that has *n't* been laid
