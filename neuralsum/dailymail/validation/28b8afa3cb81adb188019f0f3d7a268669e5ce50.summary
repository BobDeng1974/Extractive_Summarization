@entity1 captain @entity0 inspired the @entity3 champions to a first home win over their near - neighbours for five years in an entertaining derby at @entity8			1
@entity9 had ended @entity10 100 per cent record in toppling them from top spot in their last match but they could not repeat the feat against a @entity18 side that for an hour played like champions			0
@entity0 , once more revelling in his role of makeshift scrum - half , was the architect of a superb 32 - 24 victory , @entity18 ' sixth out of six so far in their title defence , scoring one try and setting up two others to put his side into an 18 - 6 half - time lead			1
@entity0 scores a try past @entity29 during the @entity3 match at @entity8 @entity1 ' victory was based on their aggressive forward display but some of the shine was taken away by the loss of outstanding second rower @entity36 with a suspected broken arm			1
@entity9 carved out the first scoring chance of a frantic opening , with centre @entity41 breaking out of his own 20 - metre area to give winger @entity44 a sniff of the try line but @entity18 scrambled superbly to keep it intact			0
it was end - to - end football , with @entity9 stand - off @entity49 unable to finish off a clean break by @entity51 and @entity1 left winger @entity52 twice bundled into touch before @entity54 broke the deadlock on 17 minutes			1
@entity49 of @entity9 is tackled by @entity56 and @entity57 of @entity1 during the game he maintained his impressive start to the year by taking @entity0 's short pass to crash over for his fourth try of the campaign and @entity63 kicked the first of his six goals			1
the champions were clearly winning the physical battle but the visitors demonstrated their potency on 24 minutes when hooker @entity70 dummied his way over from dummy half after prop @entity73 had been hauled down short of the line			2
@entity51 's goal levelled the scores but @entity18 , with hooker @entity77 making a belated return to the side from the bench , struck twice in the last 12 minutes of the first half to establish control			0
@entity83 celebrates his second half try during the match @entity0 fortuitously scored the first , taking advantage of a kind bounce by regathering the ball after centre @entity89 had twice kicked ahead and then produced a sublime cut - out pass to get @entity52 over			1
@entity63 ' conversions made it 18 - 6 at the break and he attempted to extend the lead with a 40 - metre penalty early in the second half but was off target for the first time			2
@entity9 pulled a try back on 48 minutes through replacement hooker @entity83 , who shot through a gap in the home defence from dummy half to touch down , with @entity104 adding the goal to cut the gap to just six points			2
however , @entity18 were unmoved and scored their fourth try six minutes later through forward @entity109 , who took three defenders over the line with him			0
@entity73 of @entity9 is tackled by @entity77 at @entity8 @entity1 suffered a blow when the outstanding @entity54 went off on the hour and they survived a scare when @entity114 produced a spectacular dive at the corner only for slow - motion replays showed he touched the ball down on the touch - in - goal line			1
saints looked to have wrapped up the win when second rower @entity123 charged 60 metres after picking up a loose ball to set up the position for @entity77 to get right winger @entity127 over at the corner			2
@entity63 ' touchline conversion put his side 18 points clear but the champions were given a late fright when the visitors scored two tries in the last 11 minutes			0
@entity49 gained possession from a charge - down to send @entity114 away for a deserved try and prop @entity138 romped over from close range , with @entity104 adding both goals			0
however , @entity63 had the final say with a last - minute penalty to seal a notable success			0
@entity44 of @entity9 scores a second half try			0

@entity1 captain @entity0 inspired the @entity3 champions to win
@entity0 once again *excelled* in his role of makeshift scrum - half
saints have now win six out of six so far in their title defence
however , they lost the superb @entity36 to a suspected broken arm
