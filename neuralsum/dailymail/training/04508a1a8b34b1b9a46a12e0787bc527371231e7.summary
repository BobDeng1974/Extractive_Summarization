by @entity0 a staple in the royal calendar for generations , the @entity1 has been attended by countless members of @entity7 's leading family over the years			1
the event , dedicated to celebrating all things floral , has taken place almost every year since 1913 following the success of an international horticultural exhibition organised by the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) in 1912			0
held in the beautiful grounds of the @entity16 , @entity1 , it is an annual event ( with the exception of some years during the @entity18 ) and takes place in late may			2
as patron of the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , the @entity20 has attended almost every year since she came to the throne in 1953			1
she attends the opening of the show , which begins with @entity25 on the monday , and is then given two private views along with @entity13 members			0
she is often accompanied by other members of the @entity29			0
the aim of the exhibitions is to celebrate all things floral and encourage amateur gardeners of all standards to try to achieve similar displays at home and as a keen gardener the @entity20 is often seen at her most relaxed as she tours the extravagant displays amongst some of the world 's most talented green fingers			1
here @entity42 opens the @entity20 's @entity1 photo album ... 2013 : prince @entity44 gives his grandmother the @entity20 a tour of the garden he helped design on behalf of his charity @entity50 2013 : @entity20 visits the @entity1 in @entity51 with her husband @entity52 and grandson @entity44 the @entity20 seemed delighted at the special preparations that had been made to mark her @entity55 at the show when she attended last year @entity20 , seen here visiting the gardens at the 2010 @entity1 , is often at her most relaxed and happy at the event @entity20 is a patron of the @entity13 which hosts the flower show , and is well known for her love of the outdoors the @entity20 presents prince @entity44 with a @entity13 's @entity62 during her visit to @entity1 in 2009 the @entity20 expresses her joy at an amusing garden at the 2004 show , though it is not known what she thought of the inclusion of gnomes and other ' brightly colored mythical creatures ' in this years show there is no sign of the @entity20 's enthusiasm for the show waning as she ages , here pictured enjoying the exhibitions in 2001 ( right ) and 2002 ( left ) the @entity20 admires one of the 700 exhibits on display at the 1993 ( left ) and 1995 ( right ) @entity1 the queen at the 1984 show , in the year she became a grandmother for the fourth time upon the birth of @entity44 , who this year took part in the show himself this year marked the centennial of the show and @entity20 ’s presence was particularly poignant as her own grandson was involved			1
prince @entity44 worked with his charity @entity50 , which hopes its @entity95 - inspired garden will highlight its work aids orphans in the impoverished kingdom of @entity99			1
the @entity20 seemed delighted as her grandson showed her the garden , and her enthusiasm did n’t wane as the she took in the rest of the show , alongside many other members of the royal family			2
miss @entity107 , who has been working on the design since last august with @entity44 , said afterwards : ' @entity20 liked it			2
the @entity44 would like the plants in the middle to go to the stumpery at @entity113			0
the @entity20 thinks it needs it – it needs some greenery			0
so we are going to send them down			0
' she added : ' she has been coming here ( to @entity1 ) for nearly 60 years			0
she said she thought it might be her sixtieth year			0
' the @entity20 used to attend the show often with princess @entity124 ( left , in 1981 ) but clearly enjoys the day which ever members of her family are present in 1980 @entity20 opted for playful striped skirt and matching jacket in honour of the occasion the queen looking at @entity133 - a hybrid tea rose named in commemoration of her @entity133 in 1977 the @entity20 has attended almost every year since she came to the throne			1
seen here testing a strawberry at the 1977 show the @entity20 being shown the displays at the 1974 @entity1 by the 3rd @entity141 and @entity142			1
she has only missed five shows since becoming @entity20 in 1952 @entity144 flew back from a weekend at @entity145 to @entity146 and gave an audience to the prime minister before visiting the @entity1 in 1970 the queen admiring the blooms as she walks around the 1960 show ( left ) and the 1955 @entity1 accompanied by @entity152 ( right ) a young @entity20 visits the @entity1 with the @entity153 in 1952 , just a year after she became @entity20 following the tragic death of her father @entity155 , and before her coronation in 1953 usually demure and conservative in her style choices , the @entity20 often chooses to wear unusual headgear to the shows as a pragmatic guard against the windy conditions			1
attending the show for the 48th time last year during her @entity55 , the 86 - year - old opted for a rather different choice of head wear , striking for it 's simplicity : a decorated hairnet			0
the tulle hair piece was first designed by the @entity20 's dresser @entity172			2
it is made of a fine black netting which kept her majesty 's hair in place while she wandered the grounds			0
quite unlike the @entity20 ’s usual headgear , it is not clear why she so often chooses to don the netting for the show , but for @entity1 aficionados , @entity20 ’s fun fashion has become as much a staple of the show as her infectious smile			2
while the current @entity20 's love for the @entity13 's annual event is obvious she is by no means the only member of the family who enjoys the show			1
it has become almost a tradition that the female members in particular attend regularly , perhaps stemming from the @entity195 for gardening and the show itself			0
this year saw @entity199 attend , along with the @entity20 's grand daughters @entity200 and @entity202 , following the long tradition of @entity205 support of the show			1
2013 : getting the party started : the @entity20 's granddaughter @entity202 cuts the cake as the @entity1 celebrates its 100th birthday 2013 : the affection between the @entity44 and his father the @entity52 is obvious as they share an air kiss in the @entity213 1969 : looking very young in her floral hat , it was strawberry time for the @entity218 in the grounds of the @entity16 1950 : the queen mother wearing a dramatic two - tiered hat and fur stole when touring the show with the king 2000 : princess @entity124 did n't let ill health stop her attending the show 1987 : @entity227 of @entity228 joined her majesty at the event before her marriage to prince @entity232 ended it is certainly not something usually seen on the royal head , but for many years now @entity20 has chosen to wear a decorative hairnet when she attends her beloved flower show			1
opinion varies on why she continually chooses the slightly bizarre covering , but many believe it is to prevent her hair from blowing into her face , as much of the show is held outside in the gardens of the @entity16 , @entity1			2
however since it is presumably no more blustery than the countless other outdoor engagements , it seems the choice may be more a nod to the fun horticultural spirit of the day			0
whether adorned with tiny bows or flowers , or topped with a fascinator hat , the @entity20 's hairnet has delighted and amused for years			1
2012 1981 1987 1977 1993 2011			0

the @entity20 has attended every @entity1 , bar five , since she came to the throne in 1952
she missed her first show as @entity260 in 1953 *due* to preparation for her @entity262
a well known nature lover the queen clearly enjoys in the *festival* which celebrate 100 years this year
often pictured relaxed , smiling and *laughing* at the *elaborate* gardens on display
her grandson @entity44 took part himself this year with his charity @entity50 , much to @entity20 's delight
