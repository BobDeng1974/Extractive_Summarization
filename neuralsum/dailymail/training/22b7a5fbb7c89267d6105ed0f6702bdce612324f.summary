imagine never being able to let anyone , even your partner , see you in your natural state			2
it may sound ridiculous but this is the reality for @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , who is crippled with insecurities about her appearance without makeup			1
the 25 - year - old office administrator admits : ' my boyfriend did n't see me without makeup on until after a year			1
' i have n't been confident about my skin since i was about 15 and started suffering with acne			0
' from about the age of 17 i have never let a boyfriend see me without my makeup until at least a year down the line			1
' i would panic that they would n't find me attractive without my flawless finish and was scared to see the look on their faces when they did see me au natural			0
i went so far as to always wear waterproof mascara on holidays away together and never put my head under water for fear that was makeup mask would be washed away			2
' despite her obvious natural beauty , @entity6 's lack of confidence means she ensures she is never seen without a full face of makeup , regardless of the reassurances of those around her			1
' my friends and my boyfriends have always said they think i am mad and that i look just as beautiful without my make - up but it 's a confidence issue that i have and no matter what others say i know i look far better when my blemishes are concealed			0
' i do feel much more comfortable ' in my own skin ' these days as i have had various skin peels and lazer treatments and the affects have been amazing			0
' however if me and my partner were to split and i was to embark on a new relationship i still would n't dare to bare any sooner			1
while @entity6 's tale might sound extreme , new research reveals that the majority of women are crippled by insecurities about their natural appearance			1
women are more confident baring their bodies to a partner than their make - up free face a survey of women between the ages of 18 - 30 and found that over half ( 54 per cent ) would n't let their partner see them without cosmetics until they had been dating at least 12 months			1
in contrast the majority ( 51 per cent ) said they would bare their bodies after just six months , suggesting the nation 's females are more confident with their bodies than their skin			0
@entity91 , owner of skincare brand @entity92 + @entity92 , who conducted the research , comments : ' we were shocked to find out so many women feel so insecure about their skin that they would hide behind their makeup for such a long length of time			2
we would have expected less body confidence than skin shyness			0
' ' it 's a shame that us women appear to have so many hang ups about ourselves and we hope that our @entity92 + @entity92 beauty range will help to bring some well - needed confidence back			0
they do say after all that beauty is skin deep ! '			0
