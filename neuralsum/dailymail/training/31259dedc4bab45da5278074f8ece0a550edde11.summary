by @entity0 published : 04:24 est , 3 april 2012 updated : 05:18 est , 3 april 2012 controversial : private security guards would be able to impose £ 80 on - the - spot fines for rowdy patients in hospitals under radical new plans being discussed by the government private security firms could impose on - the - spot fines to rowdy troublemakers in @entity9 to help reduce the growing violence in @entity12 's hospital wards			1
under the controversial proposals , the guards working for the firms would also be allowed to confiscate alcohol from those who are taken to emergency departments following drunken disorder			1
the government hopes the £ 80 penalties will assist medics who are often threatened with violence			1
it is also considering a move to allow the @entity25 to apply for antisocial behaviour injuctions which could see persistent troublemakers banned from the wards			2
the @entity29 met the idea with concern claiming the move it was not in the public 's best interest			2
@entity35 , chairman of the @entity29 , said : ' the public should be greatly concerned about the gradual erosion of warranted police officers and the attempt to fill the gap with private security guards and police community support officers			1
' but the government claimed the plans - part of its alcohol strategy - were designed to hand back power to the community			2
a spokesman told @entity49 : ' we will support @entity25 trusts and foundation trusts to work with their local police to ensure that appropriate action is taken , including through hospital security staff being empowered through the @entity57			2
' under this scheme , accredited staff can be given powers to issue penalty notices for disorder to those individuals whose drunken behaviour is likely to cause harassment , alarm or distress			0
they can also take action against the consumption of alcohol in a designated public place			0
' there are already a number of hospitals in the @entity12 which have piloted similar schemes			0
security staff at @entity77 in @entity78 can demand the name and address of problem patients and issue an £ 80 fine for anti-social behaviour while in the building			0
@entity85 : security staff at @entity77 in @entity78 can already demand the name and address of problem patients and issue an £ 80 fine for anti-social behaviour inside the hospital clampdown : security guards at @entity92 in @entity93 have had similar powers to those currently being discussed by the government for four years but have not yet used them at @entity92 , @entity93 , security guards have had similar powers for four years but have not yet used them			1
security guards would need to take a training course and would need a special badge from the chief constable of their police force before they are handed the powers			1
they would not be able to detain or arrest people			0
a @entity105 spokesman said : ' we believe local people , services and businesses are best - placed to tackle these issues in partnership with law enforcement			0
' that 's why central to our alcohol strategy is ensuring local communities have the tools and powers they need to take action against irresponsible drinking and the crime and anti-social behaviour that too often results			0

security guards would also be allowed to confiscate alcohol
the @entity29 is concerned about ' the gradual erosion of warranted police officers ' but the government claims it will reduce violence on the wards
