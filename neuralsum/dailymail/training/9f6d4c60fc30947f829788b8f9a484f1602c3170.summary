statement : prime minister @entity53 delivered his long - awaited speech on immigration last week - pledging to make @entity1 less attractive to migrants @entity53 said he now planned to make migrants wait for four years before they could claim both in - work and out - of - work benefits			2

more than a third of them were highly skilled and almost four in ten worked in @entity76			0
however , the unemployment rate for foreign nationals was higher than for @entity1 at 9.2 per cent compared to 7.6 per cent			0
