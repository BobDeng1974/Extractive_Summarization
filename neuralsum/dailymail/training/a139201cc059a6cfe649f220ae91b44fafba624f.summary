@entity22 allegedly ordered beatings of wayward @entity4 , slept with married women to ' cleanse them , ' and , last fall , instructed followers to shave off the beards and hair of his critics - a deeply offensive act within @entity4 culture			1
the ' @entity31 ' - including four of @entity3 's 17 children , his son - in - law and three of his nephews - are to stand trial in @entity37 on federal charges of perpetrating hate crimes , conspiracy , evidence tampering and obstruction of justice			1
the defendants maintain the government is on a witch - hunt - and should n't intrude on internal church disciplinary matters			2
they 've denied the charges and rejected plea deals that would carry sentences of two to three years in prison instead of what they now face - sentences of 20 years or more			2
@entity3 has said he did n't order the hair - cutting but also added he did n't stop anyone from carrying it out			0
he also has defended what he thinks is his right to punish disobedient sect members			1

charged : @entity22 allegedly ordered beatings of wayward @entity4 , slept with married women to ' cleanse them , ' and , last fall , instructed followers to shave off the beards and hair of his critics - a deeply offensive act within @entity4 culture ' but i 'm not allowed to punish the church people ? i ( should ) just let them run over me ? if every family would just do as they pleased , what kind of church would we have ? ' ' you have your laws on the road and the town - if somebody does n't obey them , you punish them			1
but i 'm not allowed to punish the church people ? i ( should ) just let them run over me ? if every family would just do as they pleased , what kind of church would we have ? ' at stake is prosecutor 's ability to vividly portray how an @entity4 sect struggles with the encroaching modernity assaulting its insular community			1
in the case of the @entity3 sect , the alleged knee - jerk reaction , they claim , violently broke the law			2
' when there are conflicts and you find yourself outside the accepted set , it 's a very difficult place to be , ' said @entity108 , a one - time member of @entity110 's @entity4 community during the 1990s			1
' when someone believes something slightly different , ( people believe ) that 's a threat to my existence			0
' @entity108 added that religious disputes were commonplace in the often - time strictly - observant @entity4 culture - and often took an emotion toll on those not directly involved			1
to wit , it was just such a religious dispute that lead to the creation of the @entity4 , as a whole			1
@entity126 : deep differences within the @entity4 about how to cope with modernity have lead to dozens of splinter groups , one being the radical sect whose members ( pictured ) now stand trial the group famously broke away from the @entity135 in 1693 over the practice of shunning church members			1
another group known as the @entity4 formed in 1927 and soon began allowing the use electricity and automobiles			1
since then , multiple schisms within the church , which has no central authority , have created a range of @entity4 churches with varying rules and beliefs			1
@entity148 , a professor at @entity149 , said there are a dozen @entity4 groups living in @entity152 's @entity110 , alone , home to one of the nation 's largest @entity4 settlements			1
@entity157 relocated the members of his group in 1995 to a hilly area near the @entity162 panhandle after a dispute with his former group ' it 's a divorce within the congregation , ' said @entity167 , a professor at the @entity168 in @entity169			2
' it 's very , very sad and heart - breaking			0
' the usual expectation is that the breakup is the end of the dispute , she said			0
' each side says you go off and do your own thing and that 's the end of it , ' said @entity167			0
' there 's an understanding that you ca n't judge them			0
it 's up to @entity186 to judge the choices they make			0
' in the case of a break - up , new bishops and ministers assume control			0
sometimes the new group will move away but not usually			0
those that are pulled apart can join together at weddings and funerals but not for worship services			0
even families can be divided			0
@entity3 relocated the members of his group in 1995 to a hilly area near the @entity162 panhandle after a dispute with his former group			2
they now live on farms along a gravel @entity209 66 - year - old , who has fathered at least 17 children , has denied characterizations from authorities that his group is a cult			0
the hair - cuttings , he has said , were a response to continuous criticism he 'd received from other @entity4 religious leaders about his being too strict , including excommunicating and shunning people within his own group			1
the @entity4 believe the @entity222 instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards and stop shaving once they marry			2
in one of the attacks , authorities say , one couple acknowledged that their two sons and another man came into their house , held them down , and cut the father 's beard and the mother 's hair			0
