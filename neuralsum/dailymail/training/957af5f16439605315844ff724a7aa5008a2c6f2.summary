by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 06:39 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 18:33 est , 24 june 2013 warning : labour leader @entity3 last week raised doubts that safeguards could work to prevent arms falling into the hands of extremist groups @entity3 has been invited to a secret security meeting today in an apparent attempt to persuade him to soften his opposition to arming @entity13 rebels			1
the @entity15 leader will be briefed by spy chiefs and military top brass at the government ’s @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , which is chaired by @entity20			1
the pair have clashed over the idea of sending weapons to help end the civil war and mr @entity3 is expected to repeat concerns that arms could find their way to extremists , while backing moves for a peace conference			1
labour sources denied his hands would be ‘ dipped in blood ’ by accepting the invitation and suggested the meeting was routine			1
@entity37 also played down his role , saying it ‘ makes sense ’ for opposition leaders to discuss foreign policy issues			1
mr @entity3 attended an @entity18 meeting just once before – during the @entity44 crisis in 2011			0
it comes after mr @entity3 warned the prime minister he must ‘ build the greatest possible consensus ’ across political parties before intervening in @entity13			1
the @entity18 is chaired by the prime minister to oversee all aspects of @entity52 ’s security			0
the head of the armed forces and the intelligence agencies attend to brief ministers on the biggest threats at home and overseas			1
permanent members include deputy prime minister @entity60 , chancellor @entity61 , foreign secretary @entity62 and home secretary @entity63			0
defence secretary @entity64 , international development secretary @entity65 and security minister @entity66 are also expected to attend			2
mr @entity20 ’s official spokesman said mr @entity3 would be expected to ‘ contribute fully ’ to the talks			2
fire power : a @entity71 fighter is seen carrying his weapon near the frontline in the @entity75 neighborhood of @entity76 last week , as the row grows over the @entity52 providing lethal support ‘ they will be talking about a number of issues including @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity13			0
‘ it makes sense to discuss major issues of foreign policy and that ’s what is happening tomorrow			0
’ however , the policy differences are most stark over the issue of @entity13			0
mr @entity3 has accused the prime minister of spending too much ‘ political capital and energy ’ on lifting the @entity93 arms embargo to supply weapons to the rebels , without securing a major breakthrough at last week ’s @entity97			1
there are growing fears that any move by @entity52 to arm opposition forces could see weapons falling into the hands of extremist groups with links to @entity108			1
the @entity15 leader has questioned what safeguards the government believes could work in practice to stop this happening			2
in the commons last week mr @entity3 urged mr @entity20 ‘ to proceed with the greatest possible clarity on his strategy and purpose and to seek to build the greatest possible consensus across this @entity120 ’			0
talks : the @entity97 in @entity122 , hosted by @entity20 , was dominated last week by global divisions over how to end the bloody conflict the prime minister appeared to signal a change in approach , and suggested he wanted to reach cross-party agreement			2
‘ i appreciate the fact that [ mr @entity3 ] has tried to provide consensus on issues of foreign policy - we should always try to do that , and i hope we can re-forge that consensus in the months ahead			2
’ but he defended the decision to push for the lifting of the @entity93 arms embargo			1
‘ it sent a powerful signal that there is not a moral equivalence between @entity143 on the one hand and the official opposition , who want a democratic @entity13 , on the other			0
‘ that has helped to add to the pressure			0
there is a huge danger that people will fall into the trap of believing @entity143 ’s argument , which is that the only alternative to him is terrorism and extremism			0
‘ we should stand for something else in the @entity120 and in this country - we should stand up for people who want democracy , freedom and the sorts of things we take for granted right here			0
