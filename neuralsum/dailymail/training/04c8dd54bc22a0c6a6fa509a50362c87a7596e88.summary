professor @entity0 , who claims to be a 10th @entity1 in a form of karate having just been awarded an mbe for services to martial arts you would think @entity8 would be the toast of his fellow karate experts			1
but yesterday leading figures in @entity13 martial arts were instead angered and perplexed by the gong for a man they have never heard of			1
the award in the queen ’s birthday honours list was given to a ‘ professor @entity19 ’ who describes himself as a 10th @entity1 in a form of karate called ‘ @entity23 ’			1
however , last night former karate champions were lining up to criticise the @entity25 as they had heard of neither mr @entity8 nor his branch of their sport			1
‘ i have no idea who he is , ’ said @entity29 , who was awarded an obe for coaching the @entity31 and @entity13 karate teams for more than 20 years			2
‘ if he ’s a 10th @entity37 , then i certainly would have heard of him			0
’ @entity38 , also an obe and the winner of five @entity41 gold medals , added : ‘ i can honestly say that i have never heard of him			0
a 10th @entity37 is pretty rare – there are only very few in this country and i ’m pretty sure i know who they are			0
’ a 10th @entity37 is , indeed , exceptionally rare as it is the highest rank in many martial arts			1
despite their legendary status in karate , not even mr @entity29 or mr @entity38 have achieved it			0
@entity13 martial arts organisations were last night also similarly mystified			2
‘ i ’ve never heard of him , ’ said a spokesman for the @entity55			0
@entity57 , secretary of the @entity58 of @entity59 , added : ‘ i do n’t know who he is			0
’ investigations by the @entity63 yesterday revealed that mr @entity8 , 53 , who lives in @entity64 , west @entity65 , is a man who claims to hold many distinctions			1
although he styles himself as a professor – and the award of the @entity70 uses that form of address – mr @entity8 last night claimed it was not an academic title but awarded by a @entity76 martial arts organisation called ‘ @entity77 ’ – an organisation mr @entity38 has not heard of			1
mr @entity8 also claims to hold a bsc and a doctorate in ‘ naturopathic studies ’			1
when asked by the @entity63 where he had obtained these degrees , mr @entity8 was at first forgetful as it ‘ was a long time ago ’			1
he then said they were from the ‘ @entity85 ’ in @entity86 , the existence of which could not last night be easily verified			0
on one website , it is also claimed that mr @entity8 holds the inheritable title of @entity91 the @entity92 ¿ on one website , it is also claimed that mr @entity8 holds the inheritable title of ‘ @entity95 the @entity92 ’			1
‘ this was given to me by a friend supposedly because of what i had done , ’ said mr @entity8			2
once again , last night it proved hard to verify the existence of such a title			0
mr @entity8 denied nominating himself for the award and said he was put forward by a friend and former associate , @entity106			2
‘ he has been a friend for many years but is not a martial artist himself , ’ mr @entity8 said			1
‘ i have not put myself forward , i do n’t think that ’s allowed and its very insulting for anyone to suggest that			0
i feel like i ’m being treated as a rogue , all my ranks can be traced back to my teachers in @entity76			0
’ according to mr @entity38 ‘ anyone can invent an organisation or a martial art and label themselves a 10th @entity37 ’			2
investigations by the @entity63 yesterday revealed that mr @entity8 , 53 , who lives in @entity64 , @entity65 , is a man who claims to hold many distinctions mr @entity8 said he had been unable to teach his form of karate for a number of years because of an injury			1
but he said : ‘ my work is recognised by many organisations around the world			2
i do n’t know why other people in this country do n’t know me – i ’m certainly known within my circles , and i feel the award is deserved			0
’ a @entity133 spokesman said : ‘ the nomination for professor @entity19 , like any other , was considered on merit by the relevant independent committee , in this case the @entity138			0
‘ there are four criteria the committee particularly look at : sporting excellence ; what they give back to the community and / or their sport ; their length of service and career achievements ; and what honours they already hold			0

leading figures in martial arts baffled by @entity70 awarded to @entity8
describes himself as a 10th @entity1 in a form of karate
but former karate champions have never heard of him or branch of the sport
mr @entity8 of @entity162 , west @entity65 says his work is recognised around the world
