by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:19 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 04:01 est , 29 july 2013 he began life in a slum apartment in the backstreets of @entity6 , yet rose to become the @entity7 footman who announced @entity9 ’s birth to an expectant nation			1
to the cheers of thousands of people standing patiently outside @entity14 , it was @entity15 who strode proudly across the courtyard with the @entity18 ’s press secretary @entity17 to mount the official acknowledgement of the baby ’s safe arrival on an ornate easel			1
resplendent in his scarlet and black footman ’s outfit , the uniform gave no clue to his humble background			2
it was a mere twist of fate that @entity15 , 25 , happened to be on duty at the @entity46 door after the @entity47 gave birth to the third in line to the @entity50			1
but this simple coincidence seems fitting in a @entity53 fairytale that has delighted his impoverished family in @entity55			1
@entity15 ’s father @entity56 , a 52 - year - old welder who earns £ 33 a month , and his mother @entity58 , 41 , still live in the same slum dwelling in a rundown area of @entity6 where @entity15 spent his childhood			1
they are overwhelmed to be thrown into the spotlight thanks to their son ’s success			2
but according to the footman ’s brother @entity68 , 20 , who spoke to him after his starring role in delivering the news of the royal birth , @entity15 himself has taken the whole experience in his stride			1
joyous occasion : @entity15 , right , enjoyed a proud moment announcing the birth on monday ‘ he acted very normal about it but it was a proud moment for him , ’ said @entity68			1
‘ my parents are so proud			2
they knew nothing about the @entity82 before he got the job			2
‘ we did not know about any of it beforehand			2
we only read about it in the newspapers			2
my parents think @entity15 is blessed			1
’ standing in their dank , two - room home , which is shared between nine members of their extended family including @entity15 ’s other brother , 14 - year - old @entity93 , the footman ’s mother added : ‘ i am feeling on top of the world			1
’ to give you an idea of just how far @entity15 has travelled in his 25 years , just getting inside his family home requires negotiating several water - logged flights of stairs			1
a bed dominates the shabby main room			2
in terms of other material assets , all the family own is a television and a couple of plastic chairs			1
but although @entity15 ’s father was barely able to afford to put food on the table , he valued the importance of education and scrimped and saved to send @entity15 to school			1
‘ we were an economically challenged family , ’ said @entity68 quietly			1
‘ our parents let us boys sleep on the bed and they slept on the floor			2
but my father wanted us to go to a good school so that we could learn			2
‘ he even borrowed money so that we could go forward			2
’ after struggling at a public school in the city , @entity15 was taken in by the charitable @entity127			1
run by the @entity129 , it aims to help the destitute , homeless and underprivileged			2
@entity15 thrived in his new environment			1
‘ he is a funny guy and very creative , ’ added @entity68			2
‘ he used to play sports a lot			0
he was very enthusiastic but also serious about his studies			0
’ escape route : @entity137 's @entity136 in @entity6 which @entity15 attended before moving to the @entity138 the orphanage later sponsored @entity15 to go to the @entity140 in @entity6 , where he embarked on a degree in hospitality management			1
@entity143 , the director of the college , recalls an eager and diligent student			0
‘ he was a decent boy who never created any problems , ’ she said			0
‘ he was well - mannered and a good communicator			0
he was also punctual , well - groomed and decent , which is essential for roles in hotel management			0
’ after completing his first two years at the @entity140 , the orphanage raised another £ 10,000 to fly @entity15 to @entity152 , where he completed his degree at @entity155 ’s @entity154			1
he lived in digs in the @entity152 capital , where he cooked his own curries because he could not get used to @entity138 cuisine			1
during his final year at @entity154 , @entity15 organised a ten - mile charity walk to raise money for the orphanage ’s sponsorship scheme			1
he graduated on june 15 , 2011 , and landed a job as a junior footman at @entity14 in february the following year			0
‘ the conditions i live in now are so different from how i lived in @entity55 , ’ he said			1
‘ the orphanage literally helps transform the lives of hundreds of children each year			2
the charity enabled me to come to @entity155 and complete my studies – something others in @entity55 can only dream of			1
humble begginngs : @entity15 , pictured in the yellow t - shirt , with his old classmates ‘ if i had n’t gone to @entity137 ’s , i would be working somewhere on the streets of @entity6			1
it would have been very difficult to get a job in @entity55 because unless you have a good degree , you will not get a good job and a good salary			1
’ @entity184 , a lecturer at @entity155 ’s @entity154 , who leads the @entity185 – a scheme to bring disadvantaged children from the subcontinent to @entity138 – said : ‘ @entity15 is the sweetest of boys i have met			1
‘ he ’s particularly shy , quite reserved and old - fashioned			0
he ’s also humble , polite and gracious			0
‘ he used to call me @entity191 but i told him to call me @entity184 so now he calls me @entity193 – and i am only his teacher ! ‘ i got the shock of my life seeing him on television			0
i am so proud of him			0
he has done extremely well			0
‘ it took him a good few months to get the job at the @entity14 – he had a first interview and then the staff had to check out his credentials in @entity55			1
‘ but he loves working at @entity14			0
he has been there for 18 months and has met the @entity18			0
‘ at the moment he ’s trying to extend his visa to stay in the country			0
‘ it runs out in october so he is trying to get the paperwork together and sort it out			0
’ on the tiny island of @entity211 , they still talk about a visit the @entity18 made more than 30 years ago			0
but the momentous news of a new royal baby has barely caused a ripple in the smallest nation in the @entity217			0
as @entity219 toured the once @entity138 - ruled island , it became clear many residents had no idea a future @entity223 had been born			1
but as we broke the news , the message for @entity225 and @entity226 was clear : ‘ bring @entity229 to see us ! ’ poster boy : students and teachers at @entity233 cheering the birth of @entity9 there are no newspapers on @entity211 and only one television network , which is watched by just a few of the 11,000 inhabitants			1
the internet is notoriously unreliable			0
over breakfast at the @entity243 in @entity211 ’s central business district yesterday , most people were unaware of the royal birth			2
at a nearby market , we showed off a picture of the new infant			0
clothes stallholder @entity250 said : ‘ i had no idea about this			0
i ’d better get some royal blue baby clothes with @entity229 on them			0
’ we also visited @entity233 , where a photo of the @entity18 and prince @entity258 arriving in 1982 is still displayed on a noticeboard , and broke the news to a classroom of children and their teacher			0
student @entity264 , 15 , said : ‘ it would be the best thing if @entity225 and @entity226 could come here with baby @entity229			0
’ @entity229 is a popular name in @entity211 , but @entity268 , 15 , suggested a @entity270 name to add to his others : @entity272			0
‘ it means strong , ’ she explained			0
‘ i think @entity226 is very pretty and they all make a good family			2
’ @entity278 ’s state visit to @entity55 in 1911 marked the apogee of the @entity280			1
the centrepiece of the visit was a nine - day ceremony culminating in the @entity286 on december 12 , during which @entity278 and @entity281 were presented as @entity287 and @entity288 to princes , noblemen and landowners , as well as a crowd of more than half a million ordinary people			0
during a hunting trip in @entity296 , the @entity223 ’s party shot 21 tigers and eight rhinos			0
hot shot : @entity278 , @entity300 ( front row , fifth from the left ) in 1906			0

@entity15 , 25 , came to the @entity138 thanks to an orphanage *scholarship*
he found himself taking a lead role in announcing @entity9 's birth
his family of nine live in just two rooms back in @entity55
