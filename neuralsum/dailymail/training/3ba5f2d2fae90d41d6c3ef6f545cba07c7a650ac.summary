describing their previous lives , mr @entity12 said : ' i was 27 years - old , i had a mortgage and a business , which was very stressful and i felt like i was just existing			1
' it did n't matter when a model had made it big , whether it was us sending her or another agency , it was very inconsequential			1

reminiscing about their colourful exploits , mr @entity126 : ' we were filming with the shark fin fisherman and had dived down 20 metres , when the fisherman started hauling their nets up around us			2
everything , all our equipment got caught in the net			2
' it was pretty terrifying ; i had to pull out a knife and cut us free			2
we were very close to being in serious danger			0
' in @entity22 , we saw some commotion in the water and decided to jump in and take photos of what was going on			0
ten to twelve killer whales were circling around us but it was the bull sharks that were rushing at us from the deep			0
' i was fending off bull sharks with my camera and was too busy shoving my camera into a bull shark to get any photos , it was quite insane			0

miss @entity15 added : ' i guess you could call mine and @entity12 's meeting serendipitous			1
our strengths and weaknesses compliment one another enormously			0
all the work and constant moving we do is pretty draining - both emotionally and physically - and having my best friend and partner there with me somehow makes it all feel possible			0
i guess you kind of have to become each other 's home			0
' @entity61 is our little way of reminding people there are still ways we can make a difference and that we should n't wait until it 's too late to turn things around			0
' it 's about understanding the way the world works , how our shifting economy and desires are changing it and if there 's anything we can do to help			0
' wildlife is often the focus of our stories , but we must n't forget it 's usually man that has created the crisis			0
ultimately , our planet was n't built to cope with so many people , and the rate in which things are changing is staggering - the land is suffering , the wildlife is suffering and the people are suffering			0
' we want to show people how beautiful the natural world is but we also want to remind them there are real issues out there and we aim to show people tangible ways of supporting change			0
