just after 6pm most weekdays , @entity0 counts his tips and rushes out the door of the new @entity4 eaterie @entity5			1
@entity0 is a waiter now , blending into the @entity7 crowds as he heads for the tube station to make his way out to @entity10 , @entity11 , to train with his new club @entity12			1
four years ago @entity0 was an internet sensation , beating @entity14 in @entity17 ’s iconic @entity16 challenge in their battle over three rounds at @entity22 ’s @entity21 training centre			1
a young @entity14 poses for the camera during @entity17 's @entity16 in 2010 his @entity22 youth team - mate @entity0 readies himself for action at @entity21 training centre @entity0 currently plays for @entity27 the @entity29 clip of their duel has attracted 384,000 views so far and watching it is like something out of the console game @entity35			1
both were blessed with exceptional talent and yet they both ended up at very different ends of the football spectrum ? this , then , is a cautionary tale			0
@entity0 ’s good friend @entity41 , now 19 , is regarded as the brightest young talent in @entity44 football by @entity46 manager @entity45 and the national team ’s head coach @entity47			1
‘ if i text him , he more or less texts me back straight away , ’ reveals @entity0			2
‘ before the @entity50 , when he was about to play @entity49 i sent him a text to say i was supporting him , not my country			0
’ back in the day there was little to choose between the pair , both wingers and working hard at their game in @entity22 ’s academy teams			2
‘ when we heard @entity60 were coming , there was always a good chance we could be chosen because we were two of the most skilful players at the club , ’ revealed @entity0			2
they learned their tricks by peeking over the fence to watch @entity67 , then on loan from @entity69 , turn it on in first team training sessions			0
@entity14 is now one of @entity73 's hottest talents at the age of just 19 having moved to @entity46 @entity14 ( right ) performs the tricks as his academy pals and @entity0 ( left ) look on from there , they practised until the round the world trick that @entity14 and @entity0 routinely perform in the @entity16 became second nature			1
at 14 , @entity14 was so technically advanced that sometimes he was moved up a few levels to train with the first team			2
‘ he was that good , ’ concedes @entity0			2
watching that @entity16 clip , battled over three rounds , it appears that the world is at their feet as they perform clever tricks and flicks in front of their team - mates			1
round by round they become more adventurous , encouraged by their team - mates and playing up to the camera crew			1
it ’s good fun to watch			0
@entity14 walks out at @entity102 ahead of the @entity104 qualifiers with @entity105 and @entity106 @entity0 ( left ) is now a waiter and plays for @entity12 , while @entity14 has nine @entity73 cap @entity0 left his native @entity49 , where he was playing for a local side in @entity109 , to sign a scholarship for @entity22 when he was 16			1
he was a clever player , but he could n’t convince the coaches - @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 - to give him a professional contract at the end of his two - year spell at @entity119			0
by then , @entity14 was on his way to @entity46 , but @entity0 could n’t handle the rejection			1
the dream of making it professional was over			0
@entity0 eventually won the @entity16 competition after three rounds , but lost his place at @entity22 's academy @entity14 and @entity0 were considered as the most skillful players in the @entity22 academy at that time he was offered a short - term deal with @entity131 , but he told them he was n’t interested			1
‘ i lost my head , i was all over the place , ’ @entity0 admits			2
‘ i did n’t do anything bad , nothing stupid , i come from a good family and my dad has always been there to guide me			0
‘ but i wanted to be a pro footballer , that ’s all i wanted to do			0
’ when he went to @entity141 on trial for a week , he played well enough against @entity143 in a practice match to be asked back for a second week			0
’ he returned to @entity49 , to be with his family and friends for a few weeks while he worked it all out in his head			0
‘ i thought i was done with @entity44 football at first			0
’ in 2010 , at the age of 18 , he returned , playing for @entity151 in a @entity153 tie			1
he left , abruptly , when the club told him they could n’t afford his wages			0
@entity46 's @entity14 trains with @entity156 , and has now created a superb platform on which to build @entity0 is one of the most exciting players outside the @entity159 having forced his way back in then came the turning point , finding some focus in his football career for the first time since he was a happy - go - lucky teenager at @entity22			1
he hooked up with @entity166 ’s football academy in @entity167 , south @entity7 , putting in the hours again and was backed by the former @entity141 and @entity169 midfielder			0
few worked harder on the pitch than @entity166 in his day			0
@entity0 ’s journey has taken him into non-league football , establishing himself as one of the most exciting players to watch outside the pro game			2
since he knuckled down and worked at his game , he has played for @entity177 in @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 before his summer move to @entity182			1
@entity45 sees @entity14 as @entity73 's hottest prospect , and his performances this year have been superb @entity185 's a star anywhere in the world - @entity45 last week , when @entity14 was in @entity188 preparing for a @entity190 group game with @entity46 , @entity0 scored against @entity191 in a 3 - 0 victory at @entity193			1
‘ i still believe i can become a professional , why else would i spend six years away from my friends and family ? ’ he was in the squad on tuesday night in the @entity198 , travelling to @entity199 as his new club attempt to move away from the relegation zone			2
to play on the same pitch as @entity14 again seems fanciful , but @entity0 is determined to make it happen			1
if he does , the days of waiting on tables will be over			0
