by @entity0 pupils are not learning to think for themselves because teachers are ‘ playing safe ’ and setting work that is too easy , an adviser to prince @entity5 will warn today			1
many youngsters are not being stretched at school because staff shy away from topics that are too theoretical , according to @entity10 , a headmistress and co-director of the @entity5 ’s @entity12			1
some teachers may be bowing to the ‘ tyranny of league tables and targets ’ , fearing they will lose ground in the rankings if the material they cover is too challenging			1
' tyranny of league tables ' : headmistress @entity10 with prince @entity5 in 2005			1
mrs @entity10 recently helped the government shape its new , more rigorous national curriculum in music , for example , many teachers fail to introduce pupils to crucial aspects of music theory such as time signatures and scales because they are trying to ensure lessons are accessible to all			1
this has led to @entity35 branding some classes ‘ unchallenging , demotivating and sometimes dreary ’			2
mrs @entity10 , head of @entity37 , a high - performing private girls ’ school , will deliver the warning as she welcomes delegates to the @entity5 ’s 18th course for teachers			1
in a keynote speech at @entity44 , she will describe how the prince set up the institute 12 years ago to allow teachers to improve subject knowledge			0
mrs @entity10 will tell teachers their role is to help children learn to make critical judgments of their own			2
but she will claim pupils ‘ will be less likely to think for themselves if you are too accommodating ’			2
she will warn teachers against ‘ playing safe and submitting to the tyranny of league tables ’ , adding : ‘ it is all too easy as a teacher to fall back into the familiar routines , opt for the safe topics , stay within your comfort zone			1
but what excitement is there in that ? if it ’s too easy , there is little gained			2
‘ teaching is a matter of leading your pupils to higher ground , until they have the confidence to continue climbing by themselves			0
‘ it is the job of the teacher to motivate , to make difficult things accessible and enjoyable			0
’ mrs @entity10 recently helped the government shape its new , more rigorous national curriculum for primary and secondary schools			1
@entity35 last year reviewed a three - year @entity79 drive to raise standards of music education , following a damning report			0
it said that despite the programme , most of the schools inspected were still ‘ unduly worried that pupils might not enjoy lessons that included music theory ’			2
it added : ‘ sadly , the laudable wish for musical learning to be relevant , accessible and enjoyable too often ends in a curriculum that is unchallenging , demotivating and sometimes dreary			0
' primary education is more important than secondary in helping poor children succeed , a study claims			0
drives to improve primary learning in the 1990s have led to better gcses years later , says the @entity106 , while secondary policies have had less of an effect			0
poor pupils in @entity110 were up to 50 per cent more likely to get five good gcses in 2012 than those elsewhere in @entity114 , says the study			0
it suggests literacy and numeracy hours – which were introduced in @entity110 primary schools first – are the main reason for this .			0
