by @entity0 published : 22:17 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 06:53 est , 8 october 2013 the latest entrant in the crowded field of dating apps has perhaps the most unique twist of them all – no faces			1
launched on both @entity8 and @entity10 devices during the summer , @entity7 is banking on people wanting to meet others based on similar interests and not solely on looks			1
people can eventually choose to reveal pictures when they ’re comfortable			1
the app has moved away from the tried and true model of picking people to talk to almost solely based on looks , and steers people towards like - minded counterparts			1
write caption here the app feeds off of information in users ’ @entity24 profiles , and then creates matches through a combination of @entity28 proximity and interests in common – without revealing pictures of either side of the match			1
users then chat with each other and are even prompted with conversation topics , if they are n't as chatty as their match			2
eventually , pictures can be revealed to their new soul mate			2
billed by developers as an intellectual flirting and dating app , @entity7 has less than 50,000 downloads in the @entity43 store and has not yet cracked the top 50 social / dating apps in the @entity45			2
founder @entity46 claimed to the @entity47 that the app has had over 120,000 downloads and one million matches since its debut			2
‘ every other dating app is trying to show you a photo and pick people who are good looking , ’ mr @entity46 told the @entity47 , explaining that the idea of pairing people based on similar interests was borne from seeing everyday couples interacting			0
virtually blind : users ' faces are only revealed when they choose though apps like @entity63 , which have broken dating down to the level of a board game , have been the rage of late , mr @entity46 told the @entity47 he ’s trying to do the opposite			1
the swipe to like app has ‘ become popular because it expedites behavior in real life — we want to connect with attractive people whether the connection ’s meaningful or not , ’ mr @entity46 said			0
aside from not showing faces , @entity7 also limits the number of matches a user can receive , forcing users to deal in quality , not quantity			1
‘ we understand this is not common in real life			0
it would require a change in user behavior to accept what we ’re doing , ’ he told @entity47			0
one statistic that might draw more users to the app is the ration of women to men			0
there are currently 16 females for every male using the app , according to mr @entity46			0
additionally , only a balanced number of women can log in against men at any given time , this is done to level the playing field , the developer explained			0
if measured against @entity63 - which produces two million matches per day – @entity7 has quite a ways to go			0
but @entity7 is n’t after the @entity63 crowd .			1

went live on both @entity8 and @entity10 devices this past summer
faces are *blurred* out until both parties agree to reveal them
is aimed at the @entity115 crowd , *promotes* quality over quantity
