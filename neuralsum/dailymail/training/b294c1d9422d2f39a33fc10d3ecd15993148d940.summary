by @entity0 the images have been used throughout history , to define the bravery of @entity5 pilots who engaged in aerial combat over @entity8 skies			2
but these stunning photos of the @entity5 - some of which show more than half a dozen aircrafts engaged in acrobatic dogfights - are actually the work of a crafty fraudster			0
despite being published in 1933 in the ' diary ' of an anonymous pilot - who apparently took the photos using a camera attached to a machine gun - these impressive images were created by an @entity22 model - maker , who pocketed $ 20,000 through the scam			1
these images of aerial battle scenes were first published in 1933 by @entity27 in an anonymous diary apparently written by a flying corps pilot			1
but more than half a century later , experts discovered the images - and the words which went along with it - were actually fake according to the @entity34 , @entity27 , who served in the @entity35 , orchestrated the scenes using models of aircrafts which he suspended in the air using ' invisible ' string and wires			1
he later touched up the images , by superimposing other aircrafts onto the scene			0
the photos were then published in death in the @entity47 : the @entity48 and @entity49			0
at the time of publication , mr @entity27 said the anonymous pilot who wrote the diary could not be named , because he had defied military convention by taking his camera into aerial battle			1
mr @entity27 described in the book 's foreword how the photographs had been taken by a camera which was attached to the machine gun of the pilot 's aircraft			1
dedicating the book to those who had ' survived years of conflict and struggled over enemy lines ' , mr @entity27 said that permission was only given for the photos to be used , on condition of the pilot 's anonymity			1
mr @entity27 , who served in the @entity35 but later became a set - designer and model maker , created the images from his studio using models of aircrafts and ' invisible ' string			1
the scam made him and his wife @entity80 some $ 20,000 after the book 's publication , the impressive images were used in books , magazines and newspapers all over the world			1
but , more than half a century later , it emerged that every photograph - and the apparently personal words which went along with it - were made up			0
the scam was first unveiled in 1985 in the @entity93 and @entity94 , the magazine of the @entity96			0
but , because of the magazine 's small circulation , the photographs continued to fool the world until the @entity101 in @entity102 received documents from a friend of mr @entity27 , after his death			2
these images , pictured left , were published in death in the @entity47 : the @entity48 and photographs of a @entity110 , pictured right			0
a spokesman for the @entity101 said it accepted the photographs were fake while going through his personal documents , the experts came across photo negatives and letter from the ' @entity119 ' collection of photos , which apparently belonged to someone called ' @entity122 '			0
they soon discovered it was a pseudonym for his wife @entity124 - who had also been in on the scam			2
mr @entity27 died in @entity127 in 1955 and his widow four years later , unaware their secret would soon be discovered			2
former reconnaissance pilot @entity131 , now 91 , who served in the @entity35 during the @entity132 , was one of many who bought mr @entity27 's book			1
the former university lecturer told the @entity34 he had no idea the photos were fake until the scam was revealed			0
but he said he felt admiration towards mr @entity27 for his ' brilliant deception '			0
a spokesman for the @entity142 accepted the photographs were faked .			0
