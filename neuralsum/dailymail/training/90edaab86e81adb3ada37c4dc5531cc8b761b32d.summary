a dormant volcano buried two miles beneath @entity1 could supply heat to homes in the @entity5 city by 2019			1
there is a layer of hot rocks at this depth that heats water to more than 105 ° @entity11 )			1
and the @entity12 has announced it is planning to invest £ 52m ( $ 85m ) in a geothermal district heating network ( @entity14 ) to bring this heated water to the surface			1
it could then be used to supply nearby homes and buildings with cheaper fuel			0
houses in @entity1 could be heated by geothermal energy by 2019			1
a dormant volcano 350 - million - years - old is believed to be heating rocks and water to more than 105 ° @entity11 ) underground			1
this heated water would be brought to the surface by a geothermal district heating network ( @entity14 )			1
pictured is a @entity14 in @entity29 according to the @entity31 , work on the @entity14 will begin in 2016 and is expected to be completed by march 2019			0
district heating involves using pipes to transfer heat in the form of hot water or steam from one place to another			2
in the case of geothermal district heating , this involves bringing heated water up from underground			1
beneath @entity46 ’s crust , geothermal energy is stored in the form of heat			2
this can heat subsurface rocks and , in turn , heat water stored in underground reservoirs - or aquifers			0
bringing this water to the surface can provide a sustainable source of heat for homes , as the water underground is replenished			2
geothermal energy can be used not only to provide heat , but also to provide electricity in the form of geothermal power generation			2
while the @entity5 does not have the resource potential of volcanic regions like @entity69 and @entity70 for such power generation , it has enough geothermal energy underground to make heat - only projects a viable option			1
a network of pipes would take supply homes in @entity78 , @entity1 and @entity79 with heated water from this sleeping volcano			1
the scheme would apparently lift 1,000 homes out of so - called ' fuel poverty ' - a term used to describe households that ca n't reasonably afford to keep their homes warm - save 11,700 tonnes of @entity90 emissions a year , and safeguard 1,300 jobs			0
while geothermal @entity14 ’s are fairly common in @entity93 , this would be only the @entity5 ’s second such system			0
the first was built in @entity95 in 2012			0
the heat would be pumped to buildings through seven miles ( 11km ) of pipes , providing a cheaper form of heating than is currently available			0
each home would have a pair of pipes connected to the network , which would eliminate the need for a conventional boiler in the home			0
the pipes will be under the council ’s control , but the private sector will be tasked to construct and maintain the £ 17m ( $ 28m ) geothermal well			0
the hot water comes from heated rocks that are linked to a 350 million - year - old volcano in @entity115			2
district heating involves using pipes to transfer heat in the form of hot water or steam from one place to another			2
in the case of geothermal district heating , this involves bringing heated water up from underground where it is heated by rocks			1
this water can be pumped down before being returned to the surface while no one is entirely sure why the rocks are heated , its believed this dormant volcano is the cause			1
‘ with deep geothermal , you need a particular kind of geology , with rocks that are at a higher temperature than normal , ’ professor @entity137 from @entity138 told the @entity31			0
‘ but as you need to be able to extract the heat through water , you also need permeable rocks			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s a bit like having a hot water bottle in the ground			0
’ a network of pipes would take supply homes in @entity78 , @entity1 and @entity79 ( shown ) with heated water from this sleeping volcano			1
the scheme would apparently lift 1,000 homes out of so - called ' fuel poverty ' - a term used to describe households that ca n't reasonably afford to keep their homes warm while geothermal @entity14 ’s are fairly common in @entity93 this would be only the @entity5 ’s second such system , with the first in @entity95			2
the heat would be pumped to bildings through seven miles ( 11km ) of pipes ( comparable network shown in @entity70 ) , providing a cheaper form of heating than is currently available			0

houses in @entity1 could be heated by geothermal energy by 2019
a dormant volcano 350 million years old is believed to be heating rocks and water to more than 105 ° @entity11 ) underground
this heated water could be brought to the surface and used to heat homes
this would be done by a geothermal district heating network ( @entity14 )
only one currently exists in the @entity5 at the moment , in @entity95
@entity191 will invest £ 52m ( $ 85m ) in the project starting in 2016
