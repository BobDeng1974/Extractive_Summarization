radar images from @entity2 's sentinel - 1a satellite have revealed the aftermath of the @entity5 earthquake in unrivalled detail			2
the information from the satellites has been transformed into an interferogram , which provides a colourful and highly detailed view of the @entity12 's land mass. by comparing before and after images , scientists have discovered @entity15 shrank by about one inch due to the land that was shaken in the natural disaster			1
the tallest point in the world , however , still stands at 29,029 feet , according to @entity20			1
additionally , an area 75 miles ( 120km ) by 30 miles ( 50km ) has lifted up 3.2ft ( 1 metre ) from the ground around the capital , @entity24			1
@entity25 over @entity24 , @entity5 , generated from two @entity27 scans on 17 and 29 april 2015 – before and after the 25 april earthquake			1
each ‘ fringe ’ of colour represents about 3cm of deformation			0
the large amount of fringes indicates a large deformation pattern of 3.2ft ( 1 metre ) from the ground around @entity24 scene : a rescue chopper prepares to land , evacuating climbers from higher camps to @entity40 , @entity5			1
new radar images have shown that @entity15 shrank one inch following the @entity5 earthquake this week these are the first radar images to reveal the destruction caused by the 7 - magnitude earthquake that killed 5,000 people and affected millions more			1
' there 's a peak of slip just to the northeast of @entity24 , ' professor @entity47 from the @entity48 told the @entity53			2
he explained that what scientists count are the coloured ' fringes ' in the interferogram , of which there are about 34 from this quake			1
this translates to more than 3.2ft ( 1 metre ) of uplift			0
to the north of @entity24 , the interferogram suggests that the ground receded , and it also shows how a fault ruptured east from the epicentre , but did not break the surface			1
combining two @entity27 radar scans from 17 and 29 april 2015 , this interferogram shows changes on the ground that occurred during the 25 april earthquake that struck @entity5			2
an overall area of 120x100 km has moved – half of that uplifted and the other half , north of @entity24 subsided			1
vertical accuracy is a few centimetres @entity27 interferogram over @entity24 , @entity5 , showing deformation induced by the 25 april 2015 earthquake			1
@entity86 – west ‘ fringes ’ cross the city , with each coloured fringe corresponding to 2.8 cm of ground displacement ( both uplift and subsidence )			2
the interferogram combines two @entity27 images from 17 and 29 april 2015 launch : 3 april 2014 @entity89 life : minimum of seven years mass : 2300 kg ( 5070 lbs ) dimensions : 9.2ft ( 2.8m ) long , 8.2ft ( 2.5m ) wide , 13ft ( 4m ) high mission : monitoring sea ice , oil spills , winds and waves , land - use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes how it works : radar works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back			1
the satellite uses a technique called ' synthetic aperture radar interferometry '			2
two or more satellite radar images of the same area are combined to detect large - scale changes			2
small changes on the ground modify the reflected radar signal and lead to rainbow - coloured fringes in the ' interferogram '			2
professor @entity47 says this suggests not all the strain in the rocks before the earthquake was released in during the catastrophic event			0
@entity27 's swath width of 155 miles ( 250km ) over land surfaces has allowed for an unprecedented area size to be analysed from a single scan			1
scientists say the entire area will be covered under the same geometry every 12 days , allowing for the wider region to be regularly monitored for changes in the land			2
its ability to ' see ' through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring earthquakes and for offering images for emergency response			0
this is because it uses radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back			1
radio waves travel through air virtually unimpeded , but materials like metal , rock and water act almost as mirrors which can help reveal those areas inundated by floods			1
it also makes no different to radar if the @entity12 is in darkness			0
@entity27 is the first satellite for the @entity162 environment - monitoring programme led by the @entity163			2
the @entity164 was activated on the day the earthquake struck , prompting @entity166 to begin collecting satellite imagery , which is being made available to support relief efforts			0
in parallel , the @entity169 and @entity170 was activated by @entity172 , @entity173 and the @entity174			0
meanwhile , @entity175 has posted its own images of the earthquake providing much less detail due to cloud cover			0
' while we regularly post imagery of natural hazards , the weather and the satellites have n't cooperated in this case , ' the space agency wrote in a blog			0
' the orbital track of the satellites and the specific capabilities of the sensors on board determine whether we have imagery to share			0
in the case of @entity5 , things have n't lined up in our favour			0
' the satellite imagery is used to create maps to support relief efforts , such as this ‘ grading map ’ of @entity24 showing topographic features and crisis information			1
the red squares show road blockss , the green people markers show crowds , red dots are areas that are destroyed and yellow dots are areas that are possibly affected			0
the yellow lines mark out primary roads in the area @entity215 carries a radar that works in several specialised modes to provide detailed imagery ( artist 's impression left )			0
the data will be used for applications such as monitoring the oceans , including shipping lanes , sea ice and oil spills			0
it also provides data to map changing land cover and deformations such as those produced by saturday 's devastating earthquake in @entity5 ( right ) @entity15 before and after the earthquake			1
not much change is visible because of a fresh coat of snow and cloud cover			0
the april 23 image was acquired by the @entity239 on @entity240 @entity175 has posted its own images of the earthquake providing much less detail due to cloud cover			0
' while we regularly post imagery of natural hazards , the weather and the satellites have n't cooperated in this case , ' the space agency wrote in a blog			0

the satellite , @entity27 , sends out radio waves and times how long it takes for them to reflect back
the data has been transformed into an ' interferogram ' showing how the land mass has shifted
scientists count the colored ' fringes ' in the interferogram to detect how much the land has moved
@entity15 lost an inch of its height in the quake , but still stands at 29,029 feet
an area 75 miles by 30 miles around @entity24 has risen over three feet
