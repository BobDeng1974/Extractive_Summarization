' stepping down : @entity2 's @entity3 ambassador @entity23 ( right ) , pictured with president @entity24 in august , has resigned over claims he wrote a memo to @entity27 asking for its help in reining in the country 's military @entity2 today moved quickly to fill the vacant post after tension between the civilian government and military by appointing @entity36 , a former information minister and human rights campaigner , as mr @entity8 's successor			1
her appointment came as a surprise , with many analysts and media pundits expecting someone seen as closer to the military			0
businessman @entity46 , writing in a column in the @entity49 on october 10 , said a senior @entity2 diplomat had asked that a memo be delivered to the @entity52			2
it pleaded for @entity3 help to stave off a military coup in the days after @entity3 's may 2 raid that killed @entity58 leader @entity57 , he said			1
mr @entity46 later identified the diplomat as @entity8 , who denies involvement in the memo			0
no evidence has emerged that the military was plotting a coup and the @entity52 at the time dismissed the memo as not credible			2
replacement : former information minister @entity36 has already been appointed as mr @entity8 's successor close ties : @entity3 senator @entity66 talks to mr @entity8 ( left ) alongside mr @entity24 ( right ) during a visit to @entity68 during the summer mr @entity8 today said : ' i still maintain that i did not conceive , write or distribute the memo			1

mr @entity8 is a former journalist who covered @entity86 's civil war and later wrote a book on the role of radical @entity89 and the military in @entity2			1
with his crisp suits and colourful turns of phrase , he has developed close ties with @entity27 's top power brokers as @entity2 's envoy since 2008			0
in the past year , he has sought to ease tempers in both capitals and find common ground during an extraordinarily tense period in @entity3 - @entity2 relations that included the @entity57 raid , the jailing of a @entity105 contractor , and @entity3 accusations that @entity2 backed a militant attack on its embassy in @entity109			1

mr @entity8 's resignation was seen by many analysts as further weakening the civilian government , which is already beset by allegations of corruption and incompetence			0
@entity134 , a security analyst in @entity135 , said : ' the military may expect much more from the government , much more beyond the resignation of @entity8 , because they see that everybody perceived to be involved in this affair will be seen as anti-military and by implication anti-state			0
' @entity144 , a former senior @entity145 official who worked on @entity2 , said the issue would be unlikely to have a major impact on the strained @entity3 - @entity2 relationship unless it seriously weakened or toppled the civilian government			2
as @entity3 officials focus on thorny diplomatic and security issues with @entity2 , mr @entity8 's departure did not immediately make many visible ripples in @entity27			1
@entity155 senator @entity66 , who has been heavily involved in @entity3 - @entity2 relations , said he was sorry to learn of mr @entity8 's resignation			1
senator @entity66 said he respected the @entity2 government 's decision but that mr @entity8 would be missed ' as we continue to work through the ups and downs of our relationship ' .			2
