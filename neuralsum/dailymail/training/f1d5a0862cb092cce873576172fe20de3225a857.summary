by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 06:14 est , 8 june 2013 whether it is putting up wallpaper , assembly flat - pack furniture or tiling a bathroom - @entity5 men are hopeless at @entity7			1
more than half admit to having wrecked their homes during a failed attempt to be useful around the house , according to a new survey			0
and a third said they have been forced to try and cover up their mistakes after making a mess of a household job			0
useless : more than half of @entity5 men admit to having wrecked their home during a botched @entity7 attempt too proud to ask for help , half also confess to having left at least one @entity7 project unfinished			1
the survey of a 1,000 men , carried out by @entity29 to coincide with the blu - ray release of animation @entity27 , found 58 per cent of men had botched a @entity7 job in their home			1
and the most troublesome area is the bathroom where 20 per cent of all mishaps take place			2
a tenth of men admit to having called in repairmen to correct their blunders and then passed off the results as their own work			0
pride : half of @entity5 men also confess to having lest at least one @entity7 job unfinished the same number say they frequently wreck things but carry on regardless because they are too proud to ask for help			1
fortunately , an older generation of @entity5 men still know their way around the house			0
rather than admit their own failings , 15 per cent call on a family member , usually their fathers , to fix their @entity7 disaster			1
but all is not lost			0
around a fifth of @entity5 men are competent enough to carry out @entity7 themselves and are often asked for advice by others			2
and the same number are graceful enough to accept they have no aptitude for practical skills and get someone in to do the work for them .			0
