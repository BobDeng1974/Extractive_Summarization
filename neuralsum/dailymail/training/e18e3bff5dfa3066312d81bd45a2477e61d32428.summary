it was apparently named after a local man called @entity42 , who used to live in it			0
to ensure they would be able to find their way out , they used a long plastic line to keep them on track and mark the route they used to come into the underground tunnels the cave is so well disguised in the forest that it is incredibly difficult to find the entrance they say the cave , called @entity36 by locals , was created by underwater rivers the cave was also used by others during the @entity63 as a shelter and hideaway from enemy soldiers			1
