he said : ' ( there were ) huge expectations on him ( @entity0 )			0
he was a talent straight from day one and i think everyone put a lot of pressure on him , including himself			0
' has he maximised his potential compared to how good he was when he was young ? i think you 'd have to say he has n't			0
' he 's now won 100 caps but we still do n't know what his best position is which is not what you associate with the game 's greats , although he has achieved great things throughout his career			0
