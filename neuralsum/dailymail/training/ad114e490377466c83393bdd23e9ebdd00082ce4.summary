it can fit in a pocket , yet is nimble enough to fly through windows and even through tunnels deep underground			0
researchers have unveiled a radical new spy drone they say could revolutionise search and rescue			1
the @entity8 has even backed the project , hoping to use the drone to look for ieds and for surveillance mission			1
the tiny hexacopter , which measures about seven inches across when fully configured			1
the drone uses six rotors to keep it airborne			2
it has a 360 degree panoramic camera , and can operate when out of radio contact with operators			1
@entity26 , a @entity27 , @entity28 - based startup led by ceo ( and @entity31 co-founder ) @entity32 will build the drone			1
the @entity14 will carry a panoramic camera that provides both a 360 - degree view from the drone			1
the tiny hexacopter , which measures about seven inches across when fully configured , will initially be used in search and rescue operations in collapsed buildings , tunnels , and other confined spaces and steep grades that may be difficult for crawling robots to negotiate			1
' just like a camera , the best drone is the one you have with you , ' @entity32 said			1
' the market potential is one for every soldier , marine , police officer , swat team member , and many other jobs that expose people to danger			0
' it will also provide a way to search for improvised explosive devices and conduct surveillance of tunnels and other spaces without the use of radio frequency controls			0
funded under the @entity62 , @entity63 will address an existing capability gap in the remote inspection of small passageways and tunnels that are often â€“ blocked by debris and rubble			0
the drone uses six rotors to keep it airborne			2
it has a 360 degree panoramic camera , and can operate when out of radio contact with operators			1
under this new project , @entity26 will design and test @entity63 , a compact , highly versatile drone that can be quickly deployed for remote inspection of collapsed structures			2
the current approach used by search and rescue operations relies on costly ground robots that can be limited by ground obstacles and steep terrain			0
@entity88 users communities will include @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
@entity63 will also be used as an airborne in - tunnel surveillance system , the firm said			2
' @entity94 ( ieds ) , frequently placed in tunnels and culverts , are the predominant threat to our military forces ' said @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity26 vice president of @entity103			1
' imagine not having to get out of the protection of your armored vehicle and being able to closely inspect suspicious areas in a fraction of the time it currently takes			0
' that 's what @entity63 will enable			0
' @entity63 makes use of @entity114 's proprietary microfilament technology to solve the mission life and non-line - of - site telemetry issues			2
' a free flying vehicle this size would last less than twenty minutes and would lose communications when entering a building			0
' by contrast , the @entity63 will stay aloft as long as power is supplied from the ground and its batteries will be hot swappable .			0

tiny hexacopter measures about seven inches
has been backed by @entity8 who plan to use it to look for @entity94
carries a panoramic camera that provides 360 - degree view from the drone .
