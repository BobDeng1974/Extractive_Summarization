@entity0 has been counted out of one of the plum jobs waiting to be filled at the end of the season			2
@entity5 would have been the perfect fit for relaunching the 50 - year old @entity8 ’s managerial career after the shock of being sacked just 10 months into his @entity11 tenure			0
they are on the look out for a new boss after firing former @entity15 defender @entity14 earlier this month and are on course for a @entity17 place			0
additionally , @entity0 spoke of his wish to manage a top @entity20 side in a recent interview			1
but @entity22 understands @entity5 ’s board have ruled him out on grounds of price and profile			1
ruled out : @entity0 is too expensive to be considered for the @entity5 job they want a younger coach in the mould of @entity32 ’s @entity31 and are unwilling to pay any more than £ 1.2million a year for the right man			1
the initial response from the @entity35 is that @entity0 – like former @entity37 boss @entity36 , who also briefly came under consideration – would be too expensive after earning £ 5m a year at @entity39			0
they are also unconvinced that @entity0 , who turns 51 on friday , fits into the category of coach they are looking for after making a policy decision to try and unearth the next @entity31 and setting their sights on three targets			0
one of the trio , 40 - year old @entity48 , has already ruled himself out after declaring he intends spending at least one more season at @entity50 , where he took over in august , 2009 and reeled off seven straight wins at the start of the 2010 - 11 season , including a victory at @entity55			0
but @entity57 ’s @entity56 and @entity59 ’s 39 - year old coach @entity58 are still in the frame and look to be locked in a straight fight to succeed @entity14			1
sacked : @entity14 ( centre ) was ousted by @entity5 earlier this month down and out : @entity14 was sacked but @entity5 are on course for a @entity17 spot click here to see @entity0 ' job options @entity58 ’s stock has been steadily rising and reached new heights recently when his unfancied team beat @entity55 to end the @entity71 champions ’ remarkable 53 - game unbeaten run , while @entity56 has suffered only six defeats in 47 games as @entity57 boss and has just steered them to the @entity78 title by finishing an incredible 24 points ahead of @entity80			1
news that @entity5 are currently looking no further than those two may well come as a disappointment to @entity0 , who admitted in an interview with @entity84 just 16 months ago : ‘ i always had the hope of being a coach abroad , ’ he said			2
straight fight : @entity56 ( left ) and @entity58 are in the frame to replace @entity14 at @entity5 ‘ if i had the choice , i would probably go to @entity20 , in part because they have a mentality there that is similar to mine but also because i am fascinated by what happens in @entity20 football			1
they seem to have found a way of producing young players			0
’ unfortunately for @entity0 , they also seem to have found a way of producing young coaches , and @entity5 are closing in on two of the brightest , rather than venturing further afield , for their next managerial appointment .			2
