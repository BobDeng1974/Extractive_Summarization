@entity1 's fittest grandmother has set a new world record in weightlifting just one year after she took up the sport because her local swimming pool was closed as result of council cuts			1
all - action @entity7 , 57 , played basketball to a national level as a teenager and then took to the water after turning 40			1
she won a @entity14 gold and @entity16 silver medal at masters level but was forced to give up competing when two of her local pools were shut down in 2009			1
super-gran ! sports - mad @entity7 shows off her muscles with this deadlift the lecturer won three weightlifting golds at the @entity1 championships in @entity28 last month @entity7 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , discovered weights when her swimming pool closed the mum - of - four - who works as a sports lecturer and lives in @entity29 , @entity30 - was then introduced to dumbbells by her colleague @entity36 at the end of 2013			1
@entity7 initially lifted the weights to keep fit but soon realised she was good enough to enter the @entity39 in @entity40 in october last year			1
after qualifying with ease she then went on to win three gold medals in her first ever @entity1 championships in @entity28 in february			1
@entity7 took home first place in the deadlift , squat and bench press categories when she competed in the 63kg weight class and 55 to 59 age grouping			1
incredibly , she set a world record of 121kg in the deadlift as well as a @entity14 best in the 60kg squat and a new @entity1 record with 43kg in the bench press			1
@entity7 , who lives with her pe teacher husband @entity56 , 58 , admitted she does n't look like a typical weightlifter			1
mum - of - four and grandmother - of - three @entity7 weighs 9st 9lb and was introduced to weights by a colleague @entity7 during her qualifying event for the @entity62 in @entity40 in october 2014 @entity7 with her colleague and personal trainer @entity36 , who first introduced her to dumbbells in 2013 the 5ft 7in grandmother - of - three , who weighs 9st 9lb , said : ' i used to swim three or four times a week with a club but they closed down the one pool and a couple of years later they closed down the pool we moved to because of council cuts			1
' @entity36 got me into weights			2
he has had a go at it in the past and he looked at what i was lifting for swimming training and said i had a good chance of competing			2
' he asked if i fancied giving it a go and i just thought , " why not ? " ' when i first started training i was doing sessions at @entity86 , where the gym is mostly used by students			2
' lots of them used to look at me and think ' i bet you 're not going to lift much ' and i think they were quite surprised to see i could pull the weights i can pull			2
' i never thought of myself as someone who would be able to lift heavy weights			2
it has really been so unexpected			0
' i am reasonably tall but i am not a big person			0
i certainly do n't look like the stereotypical weightlifter			0
@entity7 , centre , won gold at her last swimming championship in 2009 but gave up when two local pools closed ' but had it not been for the pool closing i think swimming would still be my main sport			1
' @entity7 has now got her sights set on beating her global competitors when she enters the @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 , in june this year			1
the sports lecturer - who has four grown - up children @entity56 , 34 , @entity113 , 33 , @entity114 , 26 , and @entity115 , 25 - is also targeting the world record for the squat which stands at 65kg			2
@entity7 often cycles as part of her fitness routine she added : ' i had lifted weights in the past but only for conditioning to support swimming			1
' i virtually had to re-learn my technique because when you weight train for fun you can get away with slightly less technique but when you compete it 's very strict			0
' i could n't believe it when i broke the world record , i think there was a @entity134 woman who held it before me			0
i have lifted 125kg in qualifying but i just could n't quite hang on to it in the finals			0
' i want to work towards the squat world record			0
i need to get another 5kg on to the 60kg ( @entity14 record ) which i think i can achieve by june			0
' i wo n't know who is turning up until the day of the world championships but there could be people from all over the world in my age group so it will be a challenge			2
' @entity7 grew up in @entity149 before moving to the @entity30 in 1976 , where she met her husband , @entity56			1
all four of her children have caught the fitness bug and her only son @entity56 is the captain of the @entity156 national rugby union team after he emigrated there with his wife			0
the fitness fanatic only weight trains once a week but also plays netball and swims an average of 3,000m every week			0
and @entity7 hopes her success will show other people that they can keep active and strong as they get older			2
she added : ' when you look at others lifting big weights who are older than myself it shows that you do not have to get weaker with age , ' she said			0
' just because someone gets older it does not mean they ca n't do lots and lots of different things			0
' it is all about high impact stuff , they have done studies that prove if you do high impact sports where your feet are coming off the ground then muscles , bones and joints stay stronger for longer			0
' you lose strength and fitness with age but you do n't have to lose it as quickly			0
' i would like to think i feel younger and could give the college students a good run for their money in a lot of sports			0
