@entity0 controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station 's top job in an interview on @entity17 programme			1
mr @entity0 was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years			1
he said : ' if you look back at the @entity22 ( the original name for @entity8 ) , they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything			2
' they did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them			1
' the modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago – not consistently so , anyway			1
' we have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works			0
' it 's not lowering the standard , it 's not making the content simple			2
it 's about how we present it			0
' mr @entity0 , who until january was chief executive of @entity48 , added : ' i believe there are different ways to draw people into music			1
' there 's the @entity56 way , and they 're very good at that			0
' we 'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers , and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout			0
' the station has been accused of ' dumbing down ' in the past , especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more ' accessible ' to a broader audience			2
last year mr @entity0 's predecessor @entity69 ( above ) dismissed as ' complete nonsense ' claims that the station was dumbing down with just two million listeners , @entity8 is the least listened - to of the @entity8 's main stations			1

apparently we do phone - ins ? we do n't			0
' we have n't had a request show for a long , long time			0
you do hear one listener voice on the breakfast show suggesting a piece of music — that 's not exactly a phone - in			2
so it 's complete nonsense			0
