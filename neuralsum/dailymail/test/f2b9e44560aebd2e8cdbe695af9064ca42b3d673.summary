when @entity2 ' story was published last week , many were stunned by his polyamorous relationship and how he gets to share his life - and his bed - with two beautiful women			1

the women say they do not ' share ' @entity2 but are in a ' unique ' situation where they both love him - as well as each other			1

' it 's three people who fell for each other and into this unique situation			0
' @entity7 has a five - year - old son , @entity35 , from a previous relationship and has just had another baby , @entity37 , with @entity2			2
they will raise the boys in @entity40 with @entity41 - born @entity8 , who joined their open relationship after the three of them hit it off so well			2
the trio explained their open relationship to presenters @entity29 and @entity30 via a video link from their home in @entity40 @entity7 , from @entity51 , explained : ' we 're were n't looking to add a third person to our relationship when we met @entity8 , we just enjoyed going out and meeting women			1
but @entity8 fell in perfectly and it was serendipitous			0
' the trio all live together and share a super king - sized bed and @entity7 said there 's no jealousy between them as they are all in love			2
@entity8 agreed that if she ever feels jealousy , it 's never over @entity7 spending time with @entity2 but because the pair are having fun without her			1
she explained : ' when i get jealous , it 's me jealous of missing out if i 'm at work and not physically with them , it 's my two best friends hanging out and i 'm not there			0
' @entity2 said their relationship works because all parties knew where they stood at the outset			1
@entity8 and @entity7 say they do not ' share ' @entity2 and are as much in love with each other as they are with him he said : ' @entity7 and i knew when we first met we were open to the possibility of having other women in our relationship			1
' it 's not that i have two girlfriends , it 's that there are three of us in a relationship			0

we get questioned a lot about whether we 're intimate all together			0
most of the time it is all three of us			0
we like to enjoy the benefits of our unique relationship			0
' @entity2 revealed his friends and family in the @entity104 are astounded at how he 's transformed into a charming lady 's man - as at his @entity10 school , he was a ' loser ' once voted the least likely to get a girlfriend			2
the unconventional family are raising two children - @entity7 and @entity2 's newborn , @entity37 , and @entity7 's son @entity35 from a previous relationship			1
@entity8 is keen to have a baby with @entity2 in the future too but he said he gained in confidence after becoming a dating coach and learning techniques to help make himself more attractive			2
as a result , he says he 's not worried if his open relationship leads to @entity7 or @entity8 leaving him for someone else			1
' one of the cool things about the journey i have taken is i now have the confidence to meet other women if my partner moves on , so i will move on , ' he said			0
the trio admitted that all their families find their situation bizarre but all are supportive because they know they are so happy and in love			0
@entity8 said : ' imagine you meet your soul mate , now multiply that by two ! it 's twice the love			2
