emperor @entity0 : history has painted him as a cruel leader , but the poem romanticizes his life an ancient @entity6 poem praising the wife of the infamous roman emperor @entity0 has been discovered in an @entity10 town			1
the poem treats @entity12 , the wife of the cruel leader , as a goddess - describing her ascending into the heavens and painting a touching portrait of the couple			1
due to the lettering style , researchers believe the poem was written around @entity19 - two hundred years after @entity0 's death , leaving a mystery as to why someone more than 1,400miles from @entity24 would wish to write a tribute so many years later			1
@entity0 has gone down in history as one of @entity24 's most cruel , depraved and megalomaniac rulers , often indulging in orgies and blamed for a devastating city fire which allowed the emperor to rebuild the city to his own tastes			1
@entity12 was also criticised at the time			2
when , according to ancient records , @entity0 killed his first wife @entity35 , @entity12 was said to have been presented with her head			1
she then convinced @entity0 to commit matricide and was , according to the records , the real power behind the throne			2
but the poem sees @entity12 in a different light , with the goddess @entity43 welcoming her to the stars , telling her : ' my child , stop crying and hurry up : with all their heart @entity49 ' stars welcome you and establish you on the moon ... ' the poem was discovered 100 years ago - but was only recently translated			1
two excavators , @entity54 and @entity55 , found hundreds of thousands of scrolls in ancient city dumps in @entity58 in @entity59			1
the town had a population of around 10,000 at the time of the @entity63 , and the papyri contained thousands of records and details of life in the era			0
a tribute to @entity0 and @entity70 : the poem , written on two sides of the newly deciphered papyrus the process of translating is still continuing years down the line and the team , according to @entity78 , did not know what to expect other than the scroll contained a poem in @entity6 text			2
it turns out the poem , in early history 's answer to @entity87 , shows @entity12 lamenting over her lost lover			1
according to @entity78 the poem reads : ' [ @entity90 ] he was downcast and did not rejoice in the offered ( favour )			0
for she was leaving her husband , ( a man ) equal to the gods , and she moaned loudly from her longing ... ' @entity12 then ascends to the stars , crossing the planets then known to mankind , including ' the @entity99 star ' ( @entity100 ) , ' belt of the @entity102 ' ( @entity103 ) and ' @entity105 's bedfellow ' ( @entity106 )			2
when she arrived ' under a clear ( moon ) , the dance of the blessed ( gods ) she viewed '			0
then , she went out alone into the darkness of the @entity111 , ' looking around for her husband under the darkness ... ' where in the world ? @entity58 , near @entity115 , is more than 1,400miles from @entity24 theories about the range from the suggestion that it was originally composed in the time of @entity0 and was retold over the next 200 years before being written down in @entity59 , to this being a poem written about an @entity10 officials death , which used @entity0 and @entity12 as an example of star - crossed lovers			1
@entity125 , a professor at the @entity126 , who led the research , said it was possible such poems were written for members of the @entity63 imperial family after they died			0
he said : ' there is a possibility that the poem we have here recovered actually belongs to this lost genre , but we ca n't be sure			0
' emperor @entity0 was the fifth and final @entity0 of the @entity137 and inherited the throne and the title caesar from his adoptive uncle @entity140			0
the notorious emperor reigned from 54 to 68 ad , and his name was a byword for dissolution , cruelty and excess			0
n 64ad two - thirds of @entity24 was destroyed in a great fire and @entity0 famously rebuilt the city after the fire in the @entity6 classical style , including his lavish golden palace			1
@entity24 burns ; history tells us @entity0 sat playing his fiddle while @entity24 burned to the ground described by @entity157 as one of @entity24 's most cruel , depraved and megalomaniac rulers , @entity0 often indulged in orgies			1
fancying himself an artist , he entertained guests at his palace with his own performances of poetry and songs however @entity0 did not enjoy the frescoed halls and gold - encrusted ceilings for too long			0
it was completed in ad 68 - the year he committed suicide after his legions and bodyguards rose against him and the senate declared him a public enemy			0
many @entity63 at the time believed the fire and ensuing destruction had been a ploy for the emperor to indulge his aesthetic tastes , despite his having been at his villa in @entity183 , 56km away , at the time			0
the stories tell of @entity0 unconcernedly playing the fiddle while the city burned			2
he blamed the @entity188 , then a minority sect , for the fire , and persecuted them			0
early @entity192 tradition holds @entity0 responsible for the deaths of the @entity194			2
after @entity0 's suicide , the palace was stripped of its marble , jewels and ivory , and within a decade the site was filled in and built over			1
it was eventually rediscovered in the 15th century after a local fell through the ground and into the remains of the structure			0
within days people were letting themselves down on ropes so they could admire the frescoes that remained , among them artists @entity208 and @entity210 who carved their names on the walls .			0

poem was found in a city dump 1,400 miles from @entity24 along with thousands of other scrolls
pays tribute to @entity0 's wife , @entity12 , calling her a goddess who was called back to @entity221 to early
