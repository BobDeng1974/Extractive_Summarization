a 25 - year - old woman has become the fifth person in her family to be diagnosed with a devastating brain disease			1
@entity4 has @entity6 ’s disease – an inherited condition that damages the brain cells causing problems with movement , behaviour and cognition			1
she is thought to be one of the youngest people in the @entity16 diagnosed with the disease which usually develops in adulthood , after first suffering symptoms when she was 15			2
ms @entity4 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , said : ‘ the doctors told me that it would be surprising if i had @entity6 ’s at such a young age			1
@entity4 , 25 , has become the fifth person in her family to be diagnosed with a devastating brain illness ms @entity4 has @entity6 's disease as does her brother , @entity27 , ( also pictured as a child ) and father , @entity29			1
her grandmother , @entity31 , and aunt , @entity33 , have already died from the disease @entity6 's is an incurable disease caused by an inherited faulty gene , which produces a protein called @entity38			1
it 's not known how , but the gene causes widespread damage to the nerve cells in the brain , causing a range of symptoms			2
sufferers can exhibit emotional and mental changes such as mood swings , clumsiness , lack of motivation , aggression and depression which , in the early stages , can often be written off as simple personality traits			0
later , they develop physical problems such as the shakes or nervous tics , then weight loss and muscle weakness which leave the patient unable to swallow , speak or move			2
every sufferer has a different rate of deterioration , but it is a fatal condition			0
on average , patients live for between 10 and 20 years after their diagnosis			1
@entity6 's disease is estimated to affect around 8,000 people in the @entity16			1
in adults the symptoms usually appear between the ages of 35 and 50 , although until a blood test was introduced around 20 years ago , it was very difficult to diagnose it at an early stage			2
in rare cases , symptoms can start to develop in childhood			0
to inherit the condition a child has to have just one parent who has it - if a person has the faulty gene , there is a 50 per cent chance each of their children will inherit it			0
sufferers are typically aged between 30 and 50 years old and each child whose parent has @entity6 ’s has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the faulty gene			2
there is no way of slowing down or stopping the progression of the disease and sufferers usually get progressively worse for 10 to 20 years before eventually dying			1
‘ becoming 21 is a milestone and i did n’t want to go into the next stage of my life not knowing what lay in store for my future , ’ ms @entity4 said			1
‘ although i knew that @entity6 ’s was on the horizon , doctors had said it was so unlikely i had it so young so i was surprised when they told me			0
‘ i was in denial for a long time as is expected with any terminal diagnosis and i did n’t want to open up to anyone about it			0
‘ doctors told me they had n’t dealt with someone with @entity6 ’s as young as me before			0
’ the former optician suffers from involuntary movements which are managed with medication and says she has good and bad days			0
her father , @entity29 , and brother , @entity27 have also been diagnosed with the condition , and the 25 - year - old has already watched as the disease claimed the lives of her grandmother and aunt			1
her grandmother , @entity31 , died of the disease at 38 , and her aunt , @entity33 , died at 42			2
the future is uncertain for ms @entity4 and she fears she will not be able to do everything her friends may experience in their lifetimes			1
she said : ‘ i see my mates getting mortgages and having babies and i do feel like i ’m missing something			0
‘ i ’d love to think i would get the family and marriage situation but i do n’t know what the futures holds for me			0
ms @entity4 ( pictured with her mother , @entity142 ) experiences involuntary muscle movements and behavioural changes and knows the illness is progressive so wants to experience as much as possible now ms @entity4 ( pictured before her illness ) is trying to raise money for the @entity148 ‘ i would like to think it will happen			1
there is treatment sort of like an ivf process now which ensures genetically that the embryos they insert do n’t have the condition , so i would do that			0
‘ i do get sad that i do n’t have that normality that others have but i have amazing family and friends and i try my best to stay grounded and positive			0
’ she is determined not to succumb to her illness and has written a bucket list of things she wants to do before the disease worsens			1
so far she wants to meet her idol @entity164 , do a parachute jump and have a dream holiday in @entity167 to swim with dolphins			0
she will also be cycling from @entity169 to @entity170 on june 9 to raise money for the @entity148			0
to sponsor ms @entity4 visit : @entity172			2
