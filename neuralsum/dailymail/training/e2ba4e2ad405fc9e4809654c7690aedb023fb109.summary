pensioners are now better off than almost 60 per cent of the entire population , while young people have seen a slump in their fortunes			1
throughout the 1960s and 1970s people in their early twenties had more disposable income than most , but over several decades their comfortable position has been steadily eroded , according to research by the @entity11			0
at the same time , older people are now better off than most , as the @entity13 seek to woo the grey vote ahead of the general election			1
he repeated his 2010 pledge to cut @entity22 , free bus passes , tv licences , prescriptions and eye tests for wealthy pensioners			0
but at a time when deep cuts are needed to the welfare bill , critics accuse the prime minister of targeting the working poor while protecting the well - off in retirement			1
according to the @entity11 research , people aged 20 - 25 on average incomes after housing were better off than more than 60 per cent of the population			1
but dramatic shifts in their fortunes mean they are now only better off than 40 per cent of people			2
by contrast , people aged 65 - 69 , who were more comfortable than just 20 per cent of people in the 1960s and 1970s now have more disposable income than almost 60 per cent			1
it suggests @entity50 born in the 1940s are the luckiest generation , enjoying high standards of living in their teens continue today			0

' the @entity13 hope that the promise to protect Â£ 7.5billion in pensioner benefits will secure the support of older voters			1
mr @entity18 claimed people in retirement can not adjust their incomes if benefits are cut , whereas younger people could find extra work			1
in a speech in @entity89 yesterday , the @entity87 said : ' we need to make sure that we are fair as we reduce the deficit , we need to make sure the richest pay the most - and they have and they will in future			0
' the fact is , if something happens to you when you 're old , or to your income , you ca n't as easily change your circumstances as younger people can			0
' you ca n't as easily move house , or change job , or go full time			0
