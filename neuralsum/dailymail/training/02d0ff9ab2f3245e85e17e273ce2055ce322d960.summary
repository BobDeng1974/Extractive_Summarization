a fundamentalist christian church at the centre of a multi-million - pound dispute over charitable status is being investigated about claims of child cruelty			1
the @entity6 , which has 16,000 @entity8 followers , has gained the support of more than 50 @entity10 in its bid to retain its charitable status – and the entitlement to tax relief on donations			1
but this newspaper has uncovered allegations of a shocking regime inside @entity6 schools – including pupils being confined at home for using the internet , elders tearing pages from textbooks to remove material about gay rights or sexually transmitted diseases , and teenage boys and girls being banned from talking to each other			1
regime : pupils at the strict @entity34 , where liaisons are forbidden yesterday a local education authority confirmed it was investigating allegations of child cruelty and failures to teach the @entity40 at an @entity6 school in @entity42			1
@entity43 , near @entity44 , opened in september 2011 as an independent day school for boys and girls aged from 11 to 18			1
the probe , by @entity49 , local police officers and the @entity52 ’s @entity51 was triggered by a teacher at @entity43 handing over a dossier describing alleged abuses			1
these claims include the punishments imposed upon six pupils for setting up a @entity61 page			1
elders from the church are said to have responded so harshly because of the @entity6 ’s teachings on modern technology – laptops are considered instruments of evil and internet access is tightly controlled to protect followers from defiling material			1
pupils are also banned from emailing each other because , according to a school memo , ‘ such communications promote special friendships and are beneath the dignity of our calling ’			1
the dossier states that , on the elders ’ instruction , six pupils were withdrawn , confined to their homes and forbidden to have any communication with anyone outside their close families			1
inside the @entity6 community these punishments are called ‘ shutting up ’			1
the teacher , who is not a member of the @entity6 , wrote : ‘ as an employee i have known of families that have been “ shut up ’ ’ for different lengths of time			1
i have never witnessed pupils being shut up before			1
faith school : @entity43 says it has a ' strong @entity99 ethos designed to protect our students from the less desirable aspects of modern society ' ‘ the pupils were shut up between the months of may and july 2012			1
the only girl was shut up for the longest number of days and was recorded to have had 37 days off out of a possible 70 [ school ] days between may 4th and july 22nd [ when the school term ended ]			2
all of her absences were recorded as authorised absences			2
‘ she was not allowed to have any communication with anyone apart from immediate family members , i.e. those who she shared a house with			2
she suffered both mentally and physically from this controlled withdrawal from her friends ; she lost weight and was emotionally distressed			2
‘ when it was decided that she would be allowed back to school , it was controlled by the @entity6 [ @entity6 ] elders			2
she was dropped off and escorted into a classroom			2
' she remained there with work to do all day			2
she was not allowed to have contact with anyone apart from one or two teachers			2
they were not allowed to have any form of conversation with her unless it was study related			2
‘ at the end of the day she was picked up by a parent and taken home			2
she remained in her home until the following school day			2
’ a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ shutting up is not intended as a punishment but is meant to encourage people to consider the consequences of their actions			2
where young persons are involved this decision is taken ultimately by their parents , though the advice of elders may be sought			2
‘ the trustees – all brethren – decide what is best for the school based on their religious and moral beliefs			2
’ the six pupils were in @entity43 ’s sixth form			1
these boys and girls , aged 16 to 18 , are subjected to gender segregation at all times – to reflect the school ’s commitment to biblical values			2
liaisons and relationships between pupils are prohibited and monitored using @entity167			1
other stipulations include teenagers being forbidden to attend university or public events such as @entity173 football matches			2
pupils seldom play any competitive sport and have been banned from playing rugby by the church ’s @entity178 leadership			1
as the dossier compiled by the @entity43 teacher reads : ‘ the sixth - form boys at the school are a very athletic group and they wanted to start playing full - contact rugby			1
they put forward a very articulate and well - thought - through presentation as to why they felt this was necessary			0
the trustees told them they would come back with an answer within 24 hours			0
‘ their answer , as dictated to them by “ @entity178 ” , was clear that full - contact rugby should not be played as it promotes savagery			1
so for @entity6 schools in the @entity8 , decisions are no longer made locally or even nationally			0
’ teaching staff at @entity43 must also abide by strict codes of conduct and dress , as set out by the school : ‘ female staff must wear dresses or skirts ( at least knee - length ) and clothing must be modest and not revealing or low - cut			1
’ male teachers must have short hair and shave			0
the launch of the investigation comes just weeks before the @entity6 ’s appeal against the @entity214 is heard by a legal tribunal			0
the @entity214 recently decided the church did not qualify for charitable status			0
unless the verdict is overturned , the @entity6 stands to lose its entitlement to tax relief			0
as a charity , the church currently claims 25p from the @entity222 for every £ 1 received in donations under the @entity225 scheme			0
the case is worth so much to the church that it has spent £ 1.5 million on a legal campaign			0
the five - day tribunal in march will hear evidence about the church ’s charitable works			0
but other witnesses , including former members of the @entity6 , may gave their testimonies from behind screens – such is their fear of the potential consequences			0
an @entity239 spokeswoman confirmed she was aware of the dossier and added : ‘ we are working with police and local council to take any action necessary			0
’ a spokesman for @entity245 said : ‘ an allegation has been received in relation to this school			0
‘ the council is committed to protecting and safeguarding every child in @entity42			1
we take all allegations of child abuse seriously			1
’ ' sensitive ' : pupils at @entity254 in an @entity256 lesson as part of our investigation , @entity257 was given unprecedented access to another @entity6 school			1
all 192 pupils at @entity264 , near @entity265 , @entity266 , come from @entity6 families – in keeping with the church ’s stance of separation from the community , including other @entity99 groups			1
the pupils are aged from seven to 18			1
deputy head teacher @entity274 admitted that his staff – who do n’t belong to the controversial church – censor books to remove content that the school ’s trustees consider incompatible with their faith			0
deputy head : @entity274 admitted his staff censor books he also admitted the @entity6 ’s stance on issues such as gay rights and abortion made teaching ‘ delicate ’			0
mr @entity274 , a former policeman , said : ‘ i ’ve been working in @entity6 schools since 2001 so by now i know the areas that are sensitive			0
but today i still have to get approval for resources such as dvds			0
blasphemy is another area so we blank out any swear words			0
‘ recently i was teaching post- 1945 @entity8 history and the legalisation by @entity303 ’s government of abortion and homosexuality			0
many communities would say these were advances in society , the @entity6 would not			0
’ according to pupil @entity310 , 15 , his community is being unfairly targeted			0
he said : ‘ we do a lot of work for the public benefit and i really enjoy helping the less fortunate			0
for instance , we put on “ @entity316 ” , when the homeless come to our meeting hall and we feed them			0
' the public do n’t understand we only eat and drink with people with whom we share the @entity322			0
’ the @entity6 , which has 16,000 followers in the @entity8 and 46,000 worldwide , formed in 1848			0
in that year they broke off from the much larger @entity325 – an evangelical christian church founded in 1832			0
the church ’s worldwide leader @entity326 , based in @entity328 , @entity178 , assumed the leadership after the death of his father			0
@entity326 preaches that the world is ‘ evil ’ and that separation from it is the ‘ greatest thing that the @entity336 has provided ’			0
imposing : the @entity337 built next to the school leading man : @entity326 ( third from left ) , who leads the 40,000 members of the @entity6 since publication of this article the school closed for a month but reopened after being cleared by an investigation into claims that pupils were punished for using @entity61			1
@entity34 , run by @entity348 , the @entity6 , shut in february after an anonymous teacher made claims including that sixth - formers were disciplined after accessing the social networking site			0
the teacher also claimed that textbooks at the school near @entity44 , @entity42 were censored to remove material about gay rights and evolution , and that social interaction between boys and girls was banned			1
now @entity49 states : ‘ it has been unanimously agreed by all agencies involved that no specific safeguarding issues were identified and the investigation has now concluded ’			0
a letter from the @entity366 to the school described the concerns as ‘ unfounded ’			0
a statement from the school says : ‘ @entity43 is delighted that the @entity373 , the @entity371 , and the @entity372 have unanimously agreed that there were not safeguarding issues at the school after the enquiry that followed an anonymous complaint about its pastoral care			1
the school has now re-opened with the strengthened resolve on the part of both the teaching staff and pupils to maintain the standard of excellence that characterises focus schools			1
we are happy to confirm that , contrary to our article on january 20 , boy and girl pupils are not segregated at all times and pupils play competitive sport .			1
