today it ’s easy to explore foreign lands and oceans simply by using @entity3 , but centuries ago , when these worlds were first discovered , people had no choice but to rely on the tales of explorers			1
as these adventurers sailed uncharted seas and plotted what they saw , it was taken on face value that the lands they described existed			1
maps featuring these mysterious , and at times imaginary , places were copied and recreated for centuries - and in the case of the non-existent @entity19 in the @entity20 , featured in atlases as late as 1987			1
phantom islands are islands that appeared on maps before disappearing			1
among these is @entity26 , pictured here on the @entity28 as @entity29			0
the island was first referred to by @entity32 geographer @entity31 in reports taken from the 4th century bc. it was later identified as @entity34 this map shows the location of phantom islands that appears on maps from the early 16th century , but later disappeared or were renamed centuries ago when the first explorers were travelling the world , people back home had to rely on the accuracy of their sightings			1
as these explorers sailed the seas and plotted what they saw , it was taken on face value that these islands existed			1
however , despite appearing on maps for decades , some of these spotted islands were never seen again , while others were renamed			1
this phenomenon became known as the ' phantom island '			1
some were geographical errors , some were islands that were later reclassified or re-identified , while and some were mysterious land masses that people claimed to have visited but others could n’t find			2
@entity19 in the 1820s , @entity67 explorers on a ship called the @entity70 reported sightings of an island south of the @entity73 , between @entity74 and @entity75			1
captain @entity76 and his crew wrote that the landmass , later called @entity19 after the ship he was sailing on , was small and mountainous			1
however , explorers from the @entity80 who tried to locate the mysterious isle in 1840 found no trace of it			0
the island was later spotted by a captain visiting @entity86 in @entity74 some 50 years after this expedition , yet a follow - up search by captain @entity89 in 1909 , on board the ship @entity91 , again found nothing			2
despite this , the @entity19 featured on maps and in atlases until at least 1987 , although it was gradually removed from many during that time			1
in trying to explain these mysterious sightings , historians thought that @entity76 and his crew may have seen what is called a @entity102 , or a mirage , similar to those seen in the desert but are spotted in polar regions			2
the isle of demons similarly , the @entity109 , was a mysterious mass of land off the coast of @entity113 that first appeared on maps during the 16th century , before disappearing by the mid- 17th century			1
in the 1820s , @entity67 explorers on a ship called @entity70 reported sightings of an island south of the @entity73 , between @entity74 and @entity75 , pictured bottom left			0
however expeditions in 1840 and 1909 found no trace of it			0
despite this , the @entity19 appeared on maps until 1987 this map shows where reports claimed the mysterious @entity19 was located			1
it is thought that the sightings were @entity102 , or mirages , similar to those seen in the desert , but are spotted in polar regions legend has it that a woman called @entity137 was sailing to @entity138 in @entity139 , now known as @entity140 , and became pregnant to a sailor in 1542			1
she was abandoned on the so - called @entity109 as punishment , to live with the devils and wild beasts that inhabited the area			0
two years later she was rescued by fishermen and taken to @entity138 , where the story became popular folklore and was even mentioned in poems by the late 19th century poet @entity151			2
it is thought the island that @entity154 was marooned on was part of @entity156 in the @entity157 , off the coast of @entity139			0
the @entity109 , was a mysterious mass of land off the coast of @entity113 that first appeared on maps during the 16th century , pictured here in 1543 , before disappearing by the mid 17th century the story of the @entity109 became popular folklore and was mentioned in poems by the late 19th century poet @entity151			1
it is thought the island was part of @entity156 in the @entity157 , pictured , off the coast of @entity139 the @entity109 first appeared in 1508 and was often confused with the island of @entity169 , which means devils in @entity171 , located in the @entity172			2

it was shown with the inscription ‘ @entity180 ’ which means ‘ this is the island called of the devils ’			0
this island was never formerly identified , but along with @entity177 , many historians believe the two islands to be the coasts of @entity186			2
