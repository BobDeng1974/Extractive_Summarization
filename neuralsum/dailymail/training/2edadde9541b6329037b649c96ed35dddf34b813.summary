the site was originally called @entity9 , but was changed in 1997 to @entity10 - a misspelling of the word googol which is a term for the number one followed by one hundred zeros			1
there is a little confusion around when @entity10 's official birthday is , but reports claim papers to incorporate the company were filed on september 4 1998			1
