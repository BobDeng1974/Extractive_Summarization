@entity10 touches down for one of her three tries as @entity0 thrashed @entity4 in @entity20 @entity16 dives in for a score , one of eight that @entity0 managed on the night , in an impressive display @entity13 directs proceedings from behind the scrum as @entity0 bounced back from defeat to @entity7 @entity27 missed the conversion and a @entity30 penalty cut the deficit before @entity32 barged her way over after a nicely floated @entity27 pass			1
@entity35 booted another @entity37 penalty but two further tries before the break from @entity40 and @entity41 put @entity0 in control with a 14 - point lead			2
