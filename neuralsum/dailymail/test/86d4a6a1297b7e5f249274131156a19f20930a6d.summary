for two hours at the start of a test match that @entity2 can not afford to lose it was possible to believe that @entity4 ’ description of @entity5 as ‘ mediocre ’ would have the same motivating effect as @entity7 saying he would make them grovel			1
certainly the comments of the @entity11 ’s outspoken new chairman were not looking very accurate when @entity2 ’s new top three had all succumbed to a @entity5 pace attack seemingly inspired by bowling coach @entity14			2
that @entity2 averted disaster was down to their middle order			0
@entity20 , with his 22nd test century , @entity19 and , thrillingly , the rejuvenated @entity18 had restored order in this crucial first test			1
@entity23 , the most respected of @entity25 broadcasters , had said ahead of this series that @entity4 ’ words might well inspire the home side , just as @entity7 did all those years ago in 1976 when @entity5 were approaching their peak			0
and it looked that way when the @entity5 pace trio of @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 had all bowled with a discipline and skill in the opening session worthy of their great mentor @entity14 himself			0
the last time @entity2 played a test at the sir @entity44 , in 2009 , it was abandoned after 10 balls because of an unplayable outfield , and for a while it looked like @entity5 were going to kick sand in their faces again			2
what a terrible start this was for @entity2 and a captain in @entity54 , who desperately needs both runs and victories here if he is to avoid being swept out along with managing director @entity57 by the mood for seismic change			0
@entity54 , still steaming about his sacking as one - day captain ahead of the @entity62 , has been working hard on his batting with his old mentor and the man he sacked himself as @entity2 batting coach in @entity67			2
@entity20 hit his 22nd test match century to rescue @entity2 after a top - order collapse in the first test @entity20 is congratulated by @entity18 on reaching his ton and leading @entity2 out of trouble @entity20 and @entity19 put on 177 for the fourth wicket after @entity2 's top order collapsed in @entity75 @entity54 - 25 @entity76 - 23 @entity77 - 22 @entity78 - 22 @entity79 - 22 @entity20 - 22 yet a slightly altered technique that worked so well against hapless @entity81 last week did not pass its examination against a much better attack here , notably @entity34 , who took advantage of @entity54 ’s old failing against the full ball			1
by that stage the remarkable comeback of @entity88 , making his 50th @entity91 appearance 18 months after his traumatic 49th , had been nipped in the bud in the first over of the day when he fended his third ball to slip			0
the decision to prefer the proven quality of @entity88 as @entity54 ’s new opening partner to the county form horse in @entity99 had not found universal approval but it would be foolish to judge the move until @entity88 has adapted to a new role			0
a minute silence was held before the start of play in honour of @entity108 , who died last week @entity2 fast bowler @entity109 was presented with a silver cap by @entity111 in his 100th test @entity109 with @entity113 ( left ) and @entity114 after receiving a special silver cap before play @entity88 's return to the team ended with a three - ball duck when he was dismissed in the first over @entity33 celebrates after having @entity88 caught in the slips in the first over in @entity75 when @entity122 became the third to fall to a bad shot with just 34 on the board @entity2 were in trouble and @entity126 was spluttering on @entity127 about the top three being ‘ constipated ’ and in need of a ‘ good dose of syrup of figs. ’ yet by the close of the first day of a hectic spell of 17 tests in the next nine months that will make or break the captaincy of @entity54 and the coaching of @entity139 @entity2 could breathe a lot more easily after being put in to bat			1
they had moved on to 341 for five , with @entity18 , unbeaten with 71 off 80 balls , adding refreshing attacking impetus with a flurry of boundaries in a stand of 130 with 174 coming in the final session as @entity150 wheels began to fall off			1
@entity2 captain @entity54 was clean bowled by @entity34 having scored just 11 runs @entity5 fast bowler @entity34 runs off to celebrate after making a mess of @entity54 's stumps the @entity2 captain makes his way off the field after being dismissed for 11 with his team on 22 for two @entity122 was dismissed by @entity35 to leave @entity2 in a hole at 34 for three if @entity2 are going to emerge from the @entity25 unscathed then @entity20 , as the senior member of their batting order , must make his quality count , as he did here after going 20 balls without scoring before he got off the mark			1
@entity20 survived an early scare when he edged through the vacant third slip on 21 but he was soon unfurling his silky array of shots and @entity5 were looking much more like the side who @entity4 dismissed so disrespectfully			2
he was joined in a stand of 177 by the man who looks sure to be the figurehead of a new era that has struggled to blossom under the giant shadow that continues to be cast over @entity2 by @entity76			0
@entity20 and @entity19 combined to dig @entity2 out of trouble with a fourth - wicket partnership of 177 @entity20 was in brilliant form as he scored his 22nd test match century on monday in @entity75 @entity19 hit 83 off 133 balls as @entity2 began to accelerate in a wicket-less afternoon session @entity20 and @entity19 walk off for tea unbeaten on 69 and 61 respectively having led @entity2 's revival @entity19 punches his bat in frustration after being dismissed by @entity187 runs short of a century @entity19 will undoubtedly succeed @entity54 as @entity2 captain one day , especially with @entity189 being in such vogue , but for now his runs are invaluable to the incumbent and he carried on where he left off last summer			1
the man who hit who three big test hundreds and three more half centuries against @entity198 and @entity199 looked certain to add another century here , especially when @entity194 dropped him on 61 , before he got an inside edge to a short ball from @entity33 and was bowled for 83			0
there was to be no denying @entity20 , however , as he went to a hard earned hundred with a late cut boundary off @entity207 and fell just before the close for 143 to a brute from @entity34			1
only @entity54 , with 25 , and @entity76 , 23 , have scored more test centuries for @entity2			2
@entity20 kisses the @entity2 badge on his helmet after reaching his century on the first day in @entity75 @entity18 was unbeaten on 71 at the close of play having put on 130 for the fifth wicket with @entity20 the sir @entity217 in @entity44 , @entity75 on the first day of the first test match @entity2 supporters relax on the grassy bank and watch the action from the @entity25 @entity2 had chosen the side that looked inevitable after their unsatisfactory warm - up in @entity81 , with @entity88 being preferred to @entity99 and the steady @entity225 profiting from @entity227 ’s inconsistency last week			1
@entity5 , meanwhile , were bereft of those players who prefer to put money ahead of @entity91 by playing in the @entity230 , notably their star batsman in @entity232			0
it is a sad but inevitable consequence of the @entity235 revolution and one that , by the close , with the @entity91 running away from them , saw @entity5 look much more like the eighth ranked @entity91 team that they currently are .			0

@entity2 close day one of first test against @entity5 on 341 for five
@entity20 scored his 22nd test match century to lead the *recovery*
@entity2 fell to 34 for three having lost the toss and been put into bat
@entity88 fell for a duck on his return to the @entity2 team
@entity54 and @entity122 also fell *cheaply* in @entity75
@entity20 put on 177 for the fourth wicket with @entity19 ( 83 )
@entity18 unbeaten on 71 after 130 - run fifth - wicket stand with @entity20
@entity20 edged behind off @entity34 late in the day and was out for 143
