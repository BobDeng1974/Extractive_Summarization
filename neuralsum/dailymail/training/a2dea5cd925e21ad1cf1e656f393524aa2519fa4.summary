ms @entity1 says she is just following guidance from council officers who said the 70 - year - old trees are unsafe			1
workmen cut down cypress trees outside the new home of former @entity25 girl @entity1 in @entity16 , @entity17 @entity1 and @entity26 in @entity27 , the fourteenth @entity25 film but neighbours believe they should be saved and have accused the @entity29 star of putting profit before the community			1
the huge trees have now been cut down			1
@entity34 - who has lived alongside the star 's home for 30 years - dubbed the trees ' iconic '			1
she said : ' the greenery of this area is what makes it so special			0
' if you look at this road , the old trees are so important to the way it looks			2
felling them will change the whole atmosphere			0
' a lot of residents feel very strongly about this			0
we do n't want these trees to go			2
they are iconic and have been there ever since i moved in			2
' i think it is a shame for the area , it will look very different without those trees			2
' we will notice it more in winter because they were evergreens which came into their own at that time of year			2
before : the @entity11 trees as they once looked outside the new home of former @entity25 girl @entity1 in @entity16 , @entity17 after : workmen have now cut down the trees , even though a neighbour called them ' iconic ' ' i just hope they plant something else there in their place			1
' @entity72 , chairman of @entity73 who also lives alongside the property , added : ' felling these trees basically amounts to vandalism			1
' it 's just property developers making some cash without a care for the community			0
' miss @entity1 and husband @entity82 bought @entity83 , which had formerly been used as an architect 's office , at @entity86 last year			1
the @entity88 listed property was marketed with an asking price of £ 895,000			2
after submitting plans to turn it back into a six - bed home they were visited by a tree preservation officer who told them the trees were unsafe			1
@entity1 's neighbour @entity34 , pictured , called the trees ' iconic ' and that ' the greenery of this area is what makes it so special ' @entity1 , right , and husband @entity82 bought @entity83 , which had formerly been used as an architect 's office , at @entity86 last year			1
pictured left , workmen fell trees outside the property which is being renovated ' the tree preservation officer actually asked us if we were going to take down the trees because they were inappropriate for the area , ' ms @entity1 said			1
' we also took advice from three different tree surgeons and one of the trees is old and unsafe			2
' we are just doing what we have been directed to do			0
' the trees will be replaced with @entity117 oaks , fitting in with the ones across the road			0
if neighbours have any concerns we are happy to talk to them about it			0
' the former bond girl , who starred as a @entity126 spy in 1985 film @entity27 alongside @entity26 , has released books on how to renovate properties to increase their value			1
but she flatly denied this project was about making a quick buck			0
she added : ' it 's going to be our home			0
it has been used as offices for the last 60 years but we are bringing it back to residential use			0
it 's a beautiful house			0
' @entity1 says the felling came following guidance from council officers who said the 70 - year - old trees were unsafe @entity144 , tree officer at @entity145 , said the authority had decided the cypress trees were not worth keeping			1
' it is a shame to lose these two trees , but it was felt they were not worthy of a preservation order , ' she said			0
' we did publicise the proposed works and no objections were received			0
' it is felt the trees have reached the end of their useful life but we do hope the applicant continues with intentions to replace them with @entity117 oaks			0
