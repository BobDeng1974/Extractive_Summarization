by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor hundreds of children under the age of 10 are being stopped and searched by police , a @entity3 report has revealed			1
the @entity7 found over the last five years 1,136 stop and searches were carried out on under 10s - despite being under the age of criminal responsibility in @entity12 and @entity13			1
over the same period , more than one million stop and searches were carried out on children and young people under the age of 18 across 26 forces			1
the police have come under fire for using stop and search powers too often			1
the home secretary @entity23 earlier this year slammed the @entity24 for not reforming its behaviour this accounts for up to 26 per cent of all stop and searches done by the forces			1
the report said the figures collected suggested that stop and search was used ' disproportionately ' on black and ethnic minority children and young people			1
it found that of the 43 forces which provided data for the inquiry , 20 had no separate custody facilities for children and young people - which may mean they could be held alongside adults , potentially exposing them to harm and distress			0
the all - party group chair , @entity44 , said : ' we were surprised to find that despite the fact so many children are being stopped and searched by the police there is no practice guidance to inform how to deal with children , particularly those who are young or vulnerable			0
' many of these children will be in need of care and protection , possibly fleeing from sexual predators or gang violence			0
' the police need to make sure that they do n't see children as small adults and do more to ensure they always adopt an age appropriate response to every child			2
' @entity23 warned rank and file police officers the way they used stop and search powers was unacceptable @entity70 , of the @entity71 , said the findings showed the need for a new approach by police when dealing with young people			2
he said : ' any child who comes into contact with the police should always be treated differently from an adult			0
' for children who are at risk of exploitation , abuse or violence it is particularly important that the police know what steps to take to protect them and put their welfare first			0
' commander @entity90 , the @entity92 ' spokesman on stop and search , admitted a lot of youngsters were being stopped			2
he said : ' the reality is that young adults are disproportionately represented as both victims of crime and offenders			0
' a recording error that gave the person a default age of zero when no address was entered has led to an inaccurate figure of children under 10 years old who were allegedly searched			1
' in the genuine cases , children are often stopped because of intelligence that they are being exploited by adults , including gang members , to carry drugs , weapons or get involved in other criminal activity			0
' commander @entity90 said the police would consider the recommendations published today by the all - party group to ensure they were only stopping children and young people when they needed to and that they were dealt with sensitively and appropriately .			0
