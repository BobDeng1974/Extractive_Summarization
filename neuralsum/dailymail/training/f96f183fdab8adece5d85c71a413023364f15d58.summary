by @entity1 reporter when @entity3 went to hospital complaining of back ache , doctors dismissed her with a dose of painkillers			1
hours later , she was back in hospital – giving birth			2
the 20 - year - old had no idea she was expecting as she did n’t put on weight , still wore her size - ten clothes and continued having regular periods throughout the pregnancy			1
she even kept going on nights out with friends up until 5lb 8oz son @entity18 arrived			0
surprise : @entity3 , 20 , had no idea she was pregnant when she woke in the middle of the night with severe back ache			1
her son @entity18 was born just hours later miss @entity3 said : ‘ it was a big shock to everyone when i suddenly arrived home with a baby			1
‘ when i gave birth i did n’t even have a nappy to my name , let alone clothes , pram , cot … i had nothing			1
’ miss @entity3 , who lives with her parents in @entity36 , @entity37 , had woken up in the middle of the night with agonising back ache , but blamed it on period pains			1
when her condition deteriorated the next day , her mother took her to hospital , but doctors could n’t find anything wrong and sent her away with drugs to make her more comfortable			1
shortly after arriving home , however , the pain became too much to bear and miss @entity3 was taken back to hospital in an ambulance			1
it was only then that paramedics broke the news that she was pregnant and in labour – and @entity18 was born less than half an hour after she arrived at @entity55			2
slim : miss @entity3 ( in the red skirt ) when she was eight months pregnant and ( right ) at seven months			2
because she had no idea she was expecting , she continued to drink throughout her pregnancy miss @entity3 , who works as a carer , said : ‘ i was due to come on to my period that day so i thought that must have been why i was having such bad pains			1
‘ i know it might sound really stupid to some people but i literally had no idea i was pregnant – i did n’t have any symptoms			2
‘ i did n’t get morning sickness , i stayed wearing my size - ten clothes , i had regular periods throughout the pregnancy and i did n’t have any cravings			2
to give birth there and then like i did was absolutely terrifying			0
’ fortunately , friends and family rallied around to help the single mother cope with the unexpected arrival			0
she said : ‘ when i came home from hospital my friends and family had come together and donated nearly everything @entity18 and i needed , which was so kind			0
’ ' miracle ' : miss @entity3 had thought her back pain was period pain - but then her waters broke and baby @entity18 arrived half an hour later miss @entity3 had still been enjoying frequent nights out with friends right up until @entity18 ’s arrival			1
she said : ‘ i was still going out and getting drunk with my friends while i was pregnant – i had no idea i was pregnant , obviously			0
‘ i was still wearing crop - tops and mini skirts , i did n’t have a bump or anything			0
’ her pregnancy was discovered in november only after the crippling back ache struck			1
her worried mother called 111 for emergency advice and took her daughter to @entity102 in @entity103 , but doctors found nothing wrong			0
miss @entity3 said : ‘ a doctor gave me some tablets and then just sent me home			1
‘ i thought that obviously everything was fine and normal and that it must have just been period pain – they would n’t have sent me home otherwise			1
’ miss @entity3 said : ' i know it might sound really stupid to some people , but i literally had no idea i was pregnant - i did n't have any symptoms ' just hours after returning home , however , the pain became too much to bear and her mother called an ambulance to take her back to the hospital			1
in the ambulance , miss @entity3 ’s waters broke and paramedics realised she was in labour			1
‘ the next thing i remember i was in hospital with a baby in my arms , ’ she said			0
‘ everything was just so quick i did n’t really have time to gauge what was happening			0
‘ i was only in labour for 30 minutes			0
‘ in a way i ’m so glad it all happened – i would n’t change @entity18 for the world now			0
i like to call him my little miracle			0
’ unprepared : ' when i came home from hospital my friends and family had come together and donated nearly everything me and @entity18 needed , which was so kind ' , said miss @entity3 the phenomenon of undiagnosed pregnancy is n’t quite as rare as might be expected			2
studies have shown that up to one in 600 mothers - to - be do not realise they are pregnant until they give birth , or just before			2
it is more likely to occur among menopausal women and younger , busy women because they are not expecting to be pregnant and will not be looking for the signs			0
it is not uncommon for pregnant women to experience some light bleeding – or ‘ spotting ’ – especially in the first few months , which can allow them to think they are still menstruating			0
many do n’t put on very much weight and wo n’t necessarily have a defined bump			0
although the average woman puts on two stone , some gain as little as half a stone and can still fit into the same clothes .			0

@entity3 , 20 , assumed her back ache was due to period pain
when it got worse , went to hospital but was sent home shortly afterwards
when her condition deteriorated , she was *rushed* back in an ambulance
on the way , her waters broke - she gave birth to baby @entity180 mins later
says she had ' no idea ' she was pregnant as continued to have periods
she also did n't gain any weight , have a baby bump or any cravings
