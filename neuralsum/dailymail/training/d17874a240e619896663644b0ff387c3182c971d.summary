by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 19:00 est , 27 december 2012 @entity3 : 06:43 est , 28 december 2012 in his memoirs , former defence secretary sir @entity4 describes @entity6 as @entity8 's ' greatest ally ' during the @entity9			1
but behind the scenes , the relationship between the two countries was strained almost to breaking point over the sale of @entity6 @entity17 missiles in 1982 , newly released documents reveal			1
declassified files show that prime minister @entity19 warned @entity6 that if the weapons fell into @entity24 hands , the consequences for @entity8 - @entity6 relations would be ' disastrous '			1
sir @entity25 , the attorney - general , even wrote a memo on july 1 proposing the hijack of aircraft carrying missiles to @entity24 by infiltrating a cargo airline			2
@entity31 was bombed by @entity24 forces in the bay of @entity34 , @entity35 , on the may 6 , 1982 during the @entity9 there was an increasingly strained relationship between @entity19 and then @entity6 president @entity39 during the @entity40 , documents reveal the elaborate @entity42 operation was designed to convince the @entity24 that the cell was buying @entity44 on their behalf			1
he said : ' the risk of resupply to the @entity24 of further air - to - sea missiles justifies consideration of all options to prevent this — even the most way - out which may be thought to be more appropriate to a @entity54 movie ! ' the profits [ of an arms shipment ] can be enormous and will attract the cowboy carriers in circumstances where the exporting country will not want to risk its own aircraft for publicity reasons			1
' if we can discover a situation where the freight is being offered to the cowboys ... [ my friend can ] get the job but with the condition ( not unusual ) that the ' loadmaster ' is a man whom he nominates			0
' if this can be agreed , the loadmaster has total control over the flight and , therefore , could redirect the aircraft in transit to ( for example ) @entity78			0
this will cost money ( this is an expensive dirty business ) but would , in my view , be cheap at the price			0
' however , mrs @entity19 appeared unimpressed , writing on the document : ' can we have a word ? @entity86			0
' the files , released today under the 30 - year rule by the @entity89 in @entity90 , document the increasingly strained relationship between @entity19 and then @entity6 president @entity39			1
at the start of the conflict , @entity39 had declared an embargo on @entity6 arms sales and assistance to @entity24 and allowed the @entity8 fleet to use @entity6 port facilities in @entity99			2
he also aided @entity8 efforts to stop @entity24 acquiring @entity44 on the world 's arms market and provided detailed information about planes and weaponry @entity6 had sold to @entity24			2
but when @entity24 used the @entity6 guided missiles against the @entity8 @entity108 to devastating effect , relations between @entity19 and @entity39 soured			1
on may 4 , 1982 , a pair of @entity24 navy @entity6 @entity112 fighter planes attacked @entity8 ships heading towards the @entity40 with air - launched @entity116 missiles			1
one hit the type - 42 destroyer @entity118 , crippling the ship which sank six days later , killing 20 crew and bringing home the full magnitude of what the @entity108 was up against			2
@entity6 president @entity39 gestures -- watched by the @entity8 prime minister @entity19 -- during a joint press conference in @entity128 in 1983 controversial : an @entity130 fighter with @entity17 missiles a @entity133 helicopter hovers overhead as @entity31 , still burning fiercely , slips beneath the water of @entity135 @entity118 after being hit by an @entity24 exocet missile in the @entity9			1
the vessel sank whilst being towed back to safe water three weeks later , on may 25 , two more @entity44 sank the @entity139 which was carrying vital supplies , including @entity142 helicopters which were supposed to transport troops and equipment			0
twelve lost their lives in the attack and the news badly affected the nation 's morale			0
the force commander admiral @entity151 later admitted that if one of the aircraft carriers invincible or @entity155 had been hit the mission would have effectively been over			0
tensions increased still further when the @entity6 were initially reluctant to reveal how many @entity17 missiles they had supplied to @entity24			1
it was only on may 11 , a week after the attack on @entity118 , that the @entity8 embassy in @entity162 was told that an order for ten missiles had been agreed , of which five had been delivered			2
the files reveal that although @entity6 agreed to delay the completion of the deal , there was concern that they had agreed a deal to send four @entity172 to @entity173			1
as there was every indication that they would end up in the hands of the @entity24 , mrs @entity19 raised the issue with @entity39 on may 17			0
although he assured her the delivery would be delayed ' as long as necessary ' , he phoned @entity19 on may 29 to say that he was in a ' difficult position ' over the deal			0
@entity31 was a @entity183 frigate which was sunk in the @entity9 on may 24 , 1982 the files state : ' @entity173 had made it known to other @entity186 countries that @entity6 was declining to execute the contract			1
consequently , @entity6 's contracts with other @entity186 countries were in danger			2
' he then demanded a ' precise estimate ' of the date by which the missiles would no longer endanger the @entity8 @entity108			0
the rebel @entity196 wanted the @entity197 to be read in @entity198 during a thanksgiving service after the @entity40 , the papers reveal			0
a memo from mrs @entity19 's private secretary @entity201 on july 2 , 1982 , also said the very rev @entity202 wanted the order of service to contain a printed translation of the prayer			0
mrs @entity19 responded by underlining almost the entire paragraph and scribbling ' why ? ' next to it			0
although the translation was prevented , the then archbishop of @entity210 , @entity211 , provoked controversy by telling the congregation they should remember the @entity24 casualties as well as the @entity8			0
the following day , she sent him a strongly worded telegram which said : ' if it became known , as it certainly would , that @entity6 was now releasing weapons to @entity173 that would certainly be passed on to @entity24 for use against us , @entity6 's ally , this would have a devastating effect on the relationship between our two countries			2
' indeed , it would have a disastrous effect on the alliance ( @entity228 ) as a whole			0
this is the last thing that either of us would wish			0
' the next day the @entity6 backed down and said the @entity173 would be told the missiles could not be sent for ' political reasons '			1
it was thought the @entity6 had supplied around 100 @entity172 to air forces around the world , of which 30 to 35 could be available for sale on the international market			1
to prevent the missiles ending up in the hands of the @entity24 , the @entity239 set up a secret arms traffic cell to prevent the sale of any @entity44			2
a letter by then attorney general , sir @entity25 to @entity19 in which he proposes an elaborate deception plan aimed at @entity24 arms buyers which he himself admitted was ' more appropriate to a @entity54 movie ' @entity89 handout photo dated 1982 of a map key of @entity8 forces a map showing @entity8 forces surrounding @entity257 , released by the @entity89 under the 30 - year rule a map of @entity260 in @entity35 a close up of @entity8 military positions around the @entity40			1

*leaders* clashed over sale of @entity6 @entity17 missiles in 1982
@entity268 revealed in files released under 30 - year rule by @entity89
@entity42 plan ' appropriate to a @entity54 movie ' was proposed to steal missiles
