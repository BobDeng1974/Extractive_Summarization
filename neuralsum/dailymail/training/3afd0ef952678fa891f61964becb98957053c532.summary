by @entity0 it is an intensely personal question : what does it take to make you cry ? but for 100 actors , writers and other male cultural giants , it was no trouble to share the secrets that set them weeping			2
figures including @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 have all revealed that it ’s poetry that brings them to tears – and their most emotional picks have been collected for a new anthology			1
tear - jerkers : @entity13 , left , and @entity10 , right , have both identified poems which bring a lump to their throats though my mother was already two years dead @entity25 kept her slippers warming by the gas , put hot water bottles her side of the bed and still went to renew her transport pass			1
... i believe life ends with death , and that is all			0
you have n't both gone shopping ; just the same , in my new black leather phone book there 's your name and the disconnected number i still call			2
... when he whom i love travels with me , or sits a long while holding me by the hand , when the subtle air , the impalpable , the sense that words and reason hold not , surround us and pervade us , then i am charged with untold and untellable wisdom - i am silent - i require nothing further , i can not answer the question of appearances , or that of identity beyond the grave ; but i walk or sit indifferent - i am satisfied , he ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me			0
for @entity60 star mr @entity13 , modern poet @entity59 can reliably bring a lump to his throat with a touching portrait of a widower clinging to the memory of his dead wife			1
his contribution to the collection is a pair of poems , @entity71 and @entity72 , published in 1978			2
the verses , written from the perspective of the grieving man ’s son , tells how the older man keeps hoping that his wife will return at any moment , and keeps the house ready for when she does			0
of its closing lines , when the son admits that feels the same way about his departed mother , he said : ‘ if the last line does n’t bring you up short , you have a heart the size of a snow pea			2
’ the famous lines , some ancient and some just a few years old , were collected by father and son @entity95 and @entity96 , and have been published in the anthology @entity97 , which was launched yesterday			1
emotional : sir @entity12 , left , and @entity100 star @entity99 , right , chose very different verses sir @entity12 , famous for his @entity103 roles and countless theatrical performances , plumped instead for a poem describing the beauty of nature			1
in his entry for the book he described how @entity110 , a 1917 poem by @entity112 , brought him to tears in the middle of the street with its depiction of autumn			0
speaking of the inspiring moment , which struck him in @entity118 , an @entity119 near @entity120 , he said : ‘ i walked two hundred yards down the lane and broke down helplessly weeping with the never - before - seen beauty and grandeur of it all ’			0

there shall bein that rich earth a richer dust concealed ; a dust whom @entity141 bore , shaped , made aware , gave , once , her flowers to love , her ways to roam , a body of @entity141 's , breathing @entity141 air , washed by the rivers , blest by the suns of @entity156 think , this heart , all evil shed away , a pulse in the eternal mind , no @entity161 somewhere back the thoughts by @entity141 given ; her sights and sounds ; dreams happy as her day ; and laughter , learnt of friends ; and gentleness , in hearts at peace , under an @entity141 heaven			0
