by @entity1 reporter published : 17:32 est , 24 april 2012 updated : 17:32 est , 24 april 2012 a single dose of ecstasy can reset the drug user ’s internal clock and cause weeks of interrupted sleep , a new study claims			1
researchers at @entity9 in @entity10 report that the drug is a stimulant , and causes users to lose their ability to sleep peacefully and resets the body ’s internal clock			1

’ sleepless nights ? a new study claims that using ecstasy only once or twice can reset the body 's internal clock at the wrong time the study , published in a recent issue of @entity30 , springboards on past research endeavours that have found up to 70 per cent of ecstasy users reported sleep disturbance			1
dr @entity17 said that most ecstasy users partake of the drug recreationally			0
‘ they take one or two pills once a month or less , ’ he said			0
in his study – the first of its kind , @entity38 in @entity10 notes – dr @entity17 and his colleagues injected 72 lab rats with the equivalence of one to doses of @entity46 , the active ingredient in ecstasy			1
the scientists then examined the effect of the drug on the rat ’s ‘ internal clocks ’ – the parts of the body that regulate sleep			1
sleepless nights : researchers said those taking @entity46 sometimes reported weeks of restless nights researchers found that ecstasy in their systems modified two specific genes – the @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity46 , also known as 3,4 methylenedioxy methamphetamine is a psychoactive drug that releases serotonin in the brain – the chemical that is responsible for affecting mood , sexual activity , and sensitivity to pain			1
