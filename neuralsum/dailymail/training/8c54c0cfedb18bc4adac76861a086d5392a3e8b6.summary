by @entity0 published : 18:37 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 01:39 est , 5 august 2013 when @entity2 bought a holiday home in the countryside two years ago , he did it to escape the hustle and bustle of life in @entity8			1
but the @entity10 political editor has been ruffling feathers near his @entity13 cottage after complaining about a commotion of a rural kind			0
@entity2 , 49 , was so angry at a cockerel crowing outside his home early in the morning he took to @entity19 to say he was ‘ contemplating murder ’ and joked about eating the bird			1
country life : the rooster marching around outside the journalist 's holiday home , on the left cry of frustration : @entity2 bought the home in @entity29 , @entity13 , to escape the hustle and bustle of @entity8 the rooster ’s owner was less than impressed that the city - dweller was moaning about the farming lifestyle that first persuaded him to buy a cottage there			1
and after a local paper reported his gripes , @entity2 has been forced to backtrack , defending his comment as a ‘ one - off cry of frustration ’			1
the town - country clash began last week when the @entity10 journalist was at his property on the coast			0
on thursday morning he tweeted to his 180,000 followers : ‘ awoke contemplating murder – the @entity13 countryside is n’t big enough for me and the b * * * * y cockerel who sat outside my window at 5am			0
’ shortly after , he apparently endorsed the comment of @entity10 colleague @entity55 , who wrote : ‘ that ’s not murder			0
’ @entity2 re-tweeted those words , saying : ‘ interesting thought			2
’ he later retweeted a suggestion that he should make the bird into a haggis , writing : ‘ good tip. ’ after buying the cottage ( left ) he said he loved the village because it was ' laid - back '			2
@entity2 usually lives in @entity67 , @entity68 , with his wife @entity69 and their three children as a local paper in @entity73 got wind of the story he tweeted to one of its journalists : ‘ glad you tracked down the fowl bird			1
sorry you missed me ! did you photograph them or prepare them for the pot ? ! # onlyjoking			0
’ the bird ’s owner , @entity85 – himself a former @entity87 who moved to @entity13 30 years ago – said crowing was simply what roosters did , adding : ‘ that ’s all part of country life … they ’re just part of the scenery			0
’ @entity2 said last night : ‘ i have never and would never dream of complaining about what makes the countryside such an escape – the sights and sounds are natural and not man - made			1
my tweet was a one - off cry of frustration – a sort of anti-cockerel troll if you like – from a grumpy middle - aged man who had not had enough sleep			1
‘ i would no more want to have the cock - a - doodle - doos silenced than to pave over the fields or fill in the estuary			0
’ @entity2 usually lives in @entity67 , @entity68 , with his wife @entity69 and their three children			2
