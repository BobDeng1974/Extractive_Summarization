alive and kicking : @entity1 , 72 , is as healthy as an ancient 30 - year - old , scientists have said here 's the good news – 72 is the new 30			1
the bad news ? it does n’t quite mean you ’ll be wrinkle - free in your eighth decade			0
scientists have found that a primitive hunter gatherer at 30 would have had the same odds of dying as a 72 - year - old in a developed country does now			1
and over the course of 8,000 generations of humans , the biggest drop in mortality has occurred in the past four			0
since 1840 , the life expectancy of a newborn baby in a @entity20 industrialised nation has risen by around three months each year			1
lifespans are now beyond 80 in some developed nations , thanks to improved medicine and nutrition			0
the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , say that modern healthcare and medicines are responsible for increased life expectancies			0
researchers have studied the death rates of hunter - gatherers whose way of life has not changed for generations			1
they looked at tribal people in @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and the @entity42 and found that at 30 - years - old , these people had the same chance of dying as @entity46 people aged 72			2
growing old : women in @entity46 and @entity48 were found to be in the healthiest @entity20 nations at 72 @entity50 @entity51 @entity52 @entity53 @entity54 @entity55 comparing hunter gatherers with the long - lived @entity46 , the authors led by dr @entity57 , wrote : ‘ hunter - gatherers at age 30 have the same probability of death as present - day @entity46 at the age of 72			1
' in fact , hunter - gatherer death rates were closer to those of chimpanzees than to citizens of @entity46 or @entity48 , the research showed			1
since about 1840 , life spans in the longest - lived populations have increased by about three months per year , said the researchers			2
most of the death - rate reduction had occurred since 1900 and been experienced by only about four of the roughly 8,000 human generations that have ever lived			0
up to the age of around 15 , hunter - gatherers had death rates more than 100 times higher than those seen in modern - day @entity46 and @entity48			1
across the whole of their life spans they had a more than 10-fold greater likelihood of dying			0
hunter - gatherer death rates and those of people in @entity48 were much closer in 1900 than they are today , said the scientists			2
the increase in human life expectancy had been largely achieved ' by removing environmental shocks , by making injuries and illnesses less fatal with medical technology , and by enhancing health at older ages by improving nutrition and reducing disease at younger ages '			0
the findings are published in the journal @entity101 .			0

*hominids* - early humans - had the same life expectancy at 30 as a 72 - year - old living now
@entity28 researchers use death rate *statistics* to *build* theory
hunter - gatherers at 30 have the same probability of death as present - day @entity46 at 72 , ' dr @entity57
