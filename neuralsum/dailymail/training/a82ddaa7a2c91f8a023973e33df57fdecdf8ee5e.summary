by @entity0 last updated at 12:19 am on 23rd september 2011 even the most ardent fan of @entity2 will concede the seaside town has little in common with @entity4			2
any tans you might spot on @entity8 ’s @entity7 tend to come from bottles rather than hours spent in the golden @entity11 sunshine			2
and the only cowboys you ’ll find on the golden mile are builders			2
but soon that could all change			2
in an extraordinary announcement , gas prospectors have revealed that the @entity19 of @entity20 is poised to become the centre of one of the biggest gas drilling operations in @entity24			1
towering prospect : @entity2 could turn into @entity11 - by - the - sea @entity27 : @entity4 grew into a hugely prosperous city thanks to the nearby oil reserves @entity31 energy consortium @entity30 has discovered that @entity20 is sitting on one of largest reserve of ‘ shale gas ’ in @entity24			1
according to results from its test wells , there are 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the ground , trapped in a layer of compacted mud			1
if the gas can be recovered , it could provide @entity31 with enough fuel to last 50 years , plug the looming energy shortfall caused by reduced @entity48 gas supplies and create 5,600 jobs			1
and it could turn @entity2 from the leisure capital of the @entity7 , to the centre of @entity8 ’s oil and gas industry — a @entity11 - by - the - sea			1
two hundred trillion cubic feet is an unimaginably vast amount of gas			1
it is ten times more than all the gas known to be left under the @entity48			1
it ’s one - fifth the size of the biggest gas field in the world , and the volume of 66,666 @entity64			1
the prospect of 400 gas wells across @entity20 and thousands of new jobs — not to mention all those tax revenues — could n’t have come at a better time for the chancellor			1
but there is one problem : in gas and oil exploration , if something sounds too good to be true , it usually is			1
protesters who gathered in @entity2 yesterday say shale gas extraction in @entity31 is untested , expensive and dangerous			1
the gas has to be exploded out of the shale rocks using a technique called ‘ fracking ’ , which can trigger earthquakes and contaminate water supplies with toxic chemicals			1
in @entity86 , opponents have even claimed that methane escapes into nearby water sources and can emerge from bathroom taps			2
commercial fracking is new to @entity31 , but the shale gas it releases has been known about for more than a century			1
in 1875 , geologists sank a borehole in the @entity95 to investigate shale — a fine - grained rock made of compacted mud			2
during the experiment , a naked light was lowered into the hole which exploded dramatically			0
serious research into exploiting shale gas got under way in the @entity86 after @entity105 by the 1990s , drilling technology had evolved to tap into the vast amounts of fuel locked away deep in the ground			1
although shale reserves beneath the land are much easier to access than @entity48 fields far offshore , the gas is harder to extract			1
@entity48 gas forms mostly within sandstone			1
once a drill has reached the sandstone , the gas flows up and out into the world			1
shale gas is more obstinate , and stays locked away in the dense rock			1
engineers must first drill straight down through thousands of feet of earth to reach the relatively shallow layer of shale , and then turn their drills sideways to bore horizontally			0
vast amounts of water , sand and chemicals are then pumped into the hole under pressure — a technique called hydraulic fracturing , or fracking			0
under this huge strain , fissures appear in the rock , allowing the gas locked up in the shale to escape along the bore and up the well to the surface			1
until this week , the @entity144 had estimated that the shale under the @entity7 of @entity8 stored five trilllion cubic feet of gas			1
but the figure announced is beyond their wildest predictions			0
if @entity30 is right , it marks the start of a new age of gas production for @entity31 — and a lifeline for the economy			1
within five years , some of the @entity31 ’s biggest coal - fired power stations will have been shut down under @entity24 pollution regulations , while by 2023 all our nuclear plants — apart from @entity162 in @entity163 — will have been mothballed			0
some of the resulting energy deficit will be met by the thousands of new wind turbines going up in the next eight years			0
but on a still , cold january day when the turbines are still , new supplies of gas could be invaluable			2
a new move towards for gas will be good news for energy security , too			2
with the @entity48 gs fields running dry , the @entity31 will become increasingly reliant on imports from @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			0
but for all that enthusiasm , many geologists are already questioning @entity30 ’s figures			0
professor @entity181 , an expert in gas and oil at @entity184 , @entity185 , said : ‘ i ’m sceptical about these numbers and i think they could be out by a factor of 10			2
there ’s a lot of variability in these wells			2
it ’s a classic case of the money going in before the science			0
we do n’t know what makes a good or bad deposit , and we do n’t understand the impact of fracking on the environment			0
’ certainly , the prospect of exploding areas of rock underneath @entity20 has alarmed critics			1
on april 1 , a magnitude 2.3 earthquake shook the @entity7			0
it originated less than two miles from an experimental shale gas well near @entity2 run by @entity30			2
a second tremor occurred on may 27 with a magnitude of 1.5			0
the epicentre was within 500 yards of the well			0
professor @entity211 , head of energy at @entity144 , said : ‘ our work seems to show that there is probably a link between the fracking that went on and the earthquake			0
‘ but the quakes were minute in scale — on the edge of human sensitivity			0
if you pump high - pressure water into rocks that are already naturally stressed by pressure , it will tend to make them move			0
but it does n’t mean catastrophic movement			0
’ the earthquakes may be alarming , but they are unlikely to be dangerous			0
however , growing concerns over pollution are more real			0
during fracking , chemicals such as benzene are added to the water to kill off bacteria that could clog the fissure in the rocks , and to improve the efficiency of the process			0
in @entity86 , chemicals have already escaped from badly - sealed shale gas wells			1
in 2008 , researchers found benzene in a water well in @entity248 , close to a large gas field			1
sceptics also point to the fact that fracking has already been banned in @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 , as well as in @entity256 and parts of @entity258			0
@entity259 , energy campaigner at @entity261 , says : ‘ there are serious environmental and public health concerns over this			0
@entity31 has abundant renewable energy resources — the place we need to be putting our focus is wind , wave , solar and tidal			0
’ a predictable enough response , you may say			0
but there is no doubt a major shale gas development in @entity8 will meet with considerable opposition			2
that said , if in the coming months geologists confirm the claims made for the size of this reserve , it could indeed prove to be a seismic development for @entity31 .			0

the gas field in @entity20 could fill 66,000 @entity64
around 400 wells could be built across the county
