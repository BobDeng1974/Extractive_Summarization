in the future , your electric car will drop you off at work , drive home and charge itself using an automated charger , before coming to pick you up later in the day			1
that ’s the vision of @entity9 boss @entity8 , who tweeted his firm is working on a ‘ solid metal snake ’ charger that automatically moves out from the wall			1
the short reveal on @entity14 is just one of several new features @entity9 is planning to roll out for its electric cars in the next few years			1
these would autonomously charge @entity9 's electric cars			1
in a tweet ( shown ) he said it would move ' out from the wall and connect like a solid metal snake '			1
@entity8 had previously alluded to the technology at a talk in october at the moment , @entity9 vehicles are charged either by using one of the company ’s supercharger station , or plugging the vehicle in when at home			1
but , the latest technology would eliminate the need for people to manually connect their car to a charger			2
and , as cars become more automated , this could open up new possibilities for self - driving vehicles			2
currently , @entity9 has about 100 ' @entity46 ' stations scattered across @entity47 and @entity48 that give @entity50 drivers a free power source when traveling long distances			2
the technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes			0
@entity9 recently opened three supercharger stations in @entity57 and plans to set up 200 more around the world , including @entity59 , soon			2
in his tweet @entity8 wrote : ‘ btw , we are actually working on a charger that moves out from the wall and connects like a solid metal snake			1
’ he previously alluded to the technology at the reveal of the @entity68 version of the @entity50 back in october			1
‘ something i ’d like to do ... is to have the charge connector plug itself in , ’ he said at the time			0
‘ like an articulating sort of snake , or something			0
‘ i think we ’ll probably do something like that			0
so then you can just get out of your car and it ’ll go park itself in your garage			0
’ his latest tweet confirms the company 's plans to develop the technology			0
it ’s not clear when it will be rolled out , but in another tweet that has since been deleted , mr @entity8 said the technology would be used on current and future versions of the @entity50 at the moment , @entity9 vehicles are charged either by using one of the company ’s supercharger stations , or plugging the vehicle in when at home ( shown )			1
but the latest technology would eliminate the need for people to manually connect their car to a charger is this what @entity9 's charger might look like ? a video posted to @entity106 by @entity107 showed off the @entity109 system , which is a ' snake ' that can move and support itself in mid-air autonomously , perhaps showing how @entity9 's charger will move from the wall to a car in other @entity9 news , last week the firm updated its electric @entity116 sports car with a huge boost to its battery , enabling it to drive 400 miles ( 645km ) on a single charge			1
the upgraded battery pack along with tweaks to its aerodynamics means it will effectively double its range			0
to prove the capabilities , mr @entity8 revealed the firm plans to drive the car from @entity126 to @entity127 in a single trip			1
the firm has also made a new aero kit for the car to reduce drag by 15 per cent , and revealed tyres with 20 per cent less drag			0
' we have identified a new cell that has 31 per cent more energy than the original @entity116 cell , ' the company said			0
' using this new cell we have created a battery pack that delivers roughly 70kwh in the same package as the original battery			0
' combining all of these improvements we can achieve a predicted 40 to 50 per cent improvement on range between the original roadster and @entity146			0
' in other @entity9 news , last week @entity9 updated its electric @entity116 sports car ( shown ) with a huge boost to its battery , enabling it to drive 400 miles on a single charge			2
the upgraded battery pack along with tweaks to its aerodynamics means it will effectively double its range			0

@entity8 said @entity19 - based @entity9 is working on automatic chargers
these would plug themselves in autonomously and charge electric cars
he tweeted it would move ' out from the wall and connect like a solid snake '
mr @entity8 previously alluded to the technology at a talk in october
he *envisions* a future where @entity9 's cars park and charge themselves
