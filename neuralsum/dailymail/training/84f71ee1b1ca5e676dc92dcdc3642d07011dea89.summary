@entity0 may have been trapped into rocks in a process called carbonation by @entity5 reporter published : 05:19 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 10:27 est , 23 october 2013 scientists have discovered how the atmosphere of @entity8 turned to stone			1
@entity11 researchers believe they have worked out how @entity8 lost its early carbon - dioxide - rich atmosphere to become the cold and arid planet it is today			1
the research provides the first direct evidence on @entity8 of a process called ' carbonation ' , whereby a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide , water and chemicals within solid rock react to ' suck in ' the carbon and trap it within the rock			1
the process exists here as well , and scientists believe understanding and harnessing carbonation could make it an ally in controlling climate and @entity0 emissions on @entity34			1
however , the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of @entity8 around 4,000 million years ago is likely to have caused the planet to cool			0
the research was carried out at the @entity48 , the @entity49 , and the @entity50 in @entity51 in a paper published in the journal @entity55 , the research team describes analyses of a @entity8 meteorite known as @entity58 , sourced from the research collections of the @entity50 and the @entity60 in @entity61			2
researchers found evidence of carbonation by studying a meteorite known as @entity58 ( pictured )			2
the meteorite is thought to have landed on @entity34 roughly 3000 years ago the latest theory is the co2 in @entity8 ' atmosphere was sucked into rocks , in a process called carbonation			1
the process occurs naturally on @entity34 , and if harnessed , could be used to combat climate change			1
researchers at the @entity48 , the @entity49 and the @entity50 in @entity51 found evidence of this by studying a meteorite known as @entity58			2
the meteorite is thought to have landed on @entity34 roughly 3,000 years ago			0
they found patterns of carbonate minerals in the meteorite by using an electron scanning microscope			2
these patterns form when carbon dissolved in liquid water seeps into rocks containing the mineral olivine			0
the carbon replaces the olivine , locking it away in the rock			0
it formed from molten rock around 1,300 million years ago , and was blasted from the surface of @entity8 by a massive impact 11 million years ago			0
since its discovery in @entity96 , @entity97 , in 1931 , @entity58 has been studied by scientists around the world			0
the new research focused on a carbon - rich mineral called siderite			0
although found in @entity58 previously , the team discovered that the siderite had formed by the process of ' carbonation ' , whereby water and carbon dioxide from the @entity8 atmosphere reacted with rocks containing the mineral olivine			1
these reactions then formed siderite crystals , replacing the olivine , and in so doing captured the atmospheric carbon dioxide and permanently stored it within the rock			0
@entity58 provides direct evidence for storage of carbon dioxide in the fairly recent history of @entity8 , some time after 1,300 million years			0
however , as all of the ingredients for carbonation were present on early @entity8 - in the form of olivine , water and carbon dioxide - this reaction may explain how carbon dioxide was removed from the planet 's atmosphere , changing its climate from warm , wet and hospitable to life , to cold , dry and hostile			2
the research may explain how carbon dioxide was removed from @entity8 ' atmosphere changing its climate from warm , wet and hospitable to life , the hostile one that @entity139 's @entity138 ( pictured ) is exploring today while this process also occurs naturally on @entity34 , and is the focus of research examining methods of permanently locking up carbon dioxide from power stations , the magnitude of the effect on early @entity8 indicates that it has the potential to be effective on a planetary scale			1
lead author doctor @entity151 , of the @entity48 , said : ' @entity8 once had a thick atmosphere that was rich in water and carbon dioxide , and so this process of carbonation may help answer the mystery of why the @entity8 climate deteriorated around 4,000 million years ago			0
' this discovery is both significant in terms of the way in which scientists will study @entity8 in the future but also to providing us with vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the @entity34 's atmosphere and so reduce climate change			1

@entity0 may have been trapped into rocks in a process called carbonation
evidence of this was found in patterns of carbonate in @entity58 meteorite
this caused @entity8 to become the cold and arid planet it is today
the process also occurs on @entity34 , and if harnessed , could help *improve* *technologies* to battle climate change
