a hat - trick of tries from teenage winger @entity2 helped @entity3 to a handsome 41 - 16 win over reigning champions @entity5 that takes them six points clear at the top of @entity10			1
the 19 - year - old @entity2 got his big chance due to an injury to @entity14 winger @entity13 and how he has seized it , with six tries in just six @entity10 appearances			1
the @entity17 simply oozed confidence on the back of their five - match winning run while @entity21 looked fragile as the one - time leaders crashed to a fourth defeat in their last five matches			1
@entity3 veteran @entity25 crossed for one of his side 's seven tries against @entity5 on friday night @entity3 have now played every other team in @entity10 and , with just one defeat in their opening 11 matches , will take some stopping as they eye a first league - leaders ' title for six years			1
@entity2 's first try came against the run of play as he plucked out of the air @entity41 ' pass intended for debutant winger @entity42 of the air and sprinted 90 metres to the other end of the pitch			1
handling errors by @entity47 and @entity48 ensured @entity21 remained on the back foot and they fell further behind on 15 minutes when hugely - impressive prop @entity50 kept the ball alive on the last tackle and centre @entity52 produced a delightful one - handed pass out of the back of his hands to get @entity2 over again			2
stand - off @entity57 , preferred to skipper @entity59 in @entity3 ' starting team , justified his selection with a superb break to create a try for full - back @entity64 and his third conversion made it 18 - 0 in as many minutes			2
it got even better for the visitors when makeshift centre @entity69 split open the @entity21 defence to get veteran half - back @entity25 sprinting over from halfway for a fourth try and this time @entity59 , starting as a substitute for the first time for nearly 12 years , added the goal			0
inspired by the never - say - die efforts of @entity14 hooker @entity78 , @entity5 produced their best spell of the match and pulled a try back in fortuitous circumstances when full - back @entity83 touched down @entity86 's kick when for all it looked like a knock - on and @entity88 added the goal			0
that score suddenly brought the game to life but the @entity17 struck a devastating blow to the champions deep into first - half stoppage time when a break out of defence by @entity98 created the position for @entity100 to gift - wrap a third try for @entity2 courtesy of a pin - point kick to the corner			1
at 28 - 6 , it looked a hopeless task for the home side but the belated introduction of @entity111 scrum - half @entity112 added a new dimension to their attack and , within four minutes of the restart , he produced a jinking run through the heart of the @entity3 defence to create a try for @entity121			2
the champions were fired up by the score and props @entity123 and @entity125 were both held up over the line as they sought to further close the gap			0
the pressure finally paid off on the hour when @entity131 's high kick bounced kindly for @entity121 to score his second try and @entity88 ' second conversion cut the gap to 12 points			0
but the comeback was snuffed on 66 minutes when another @entity50 offload caused havoc in the @entity21 defence and @entity59 sent @entity100 on a jinking run to the line for the match - winning try			0
@entity143 put over a drop goal and wrapped up the scoring by converting @entity52 's last - minute try .			0

@entity2 has now scored six tries in six appearances for @entity3
the @entity17 are now six points clear at the top of @entity10
@entity3 have lost just once in their opening 11 matches
