by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 not for the first time , @entity2 have done the bulk of their summer spending in the duty free @entity7 aisle			1
it is a prudent ploy : they pick up quality goods at a competitive price , repackage them as a @entity13 commodity and place them in the ' @entity15 ' window perused by the @entity17 elite			0
this year 's continental sweep , however , has bought manager @entity19 the one stock he so desperately craves – time			1
new boys : @entity22 ( right ) and @entity23 ( left ) are @entity19 's latest acquisitions seven new signings - plus yesterday 's arrival of @entity23 and @entity22 from @entity30 , who will return on loan - have lifted the depression which had descended in the second half of last season , a period in which the @entity25 won just five of 21 matches , @entity19 headbutted @entity38 's @entity37 and 2,000 fans protested against the regime by walking out during the final home game			1
but the uprising fell flat and a steady stream of summer unveilings have , for now , quelled the dissenters			2
optimism on @entity47 , however , will always be tempered while @entity19 and owner @entity48 are in power ; time , then , is a provisional luxury , no matter the six years remaining on the manager 's contract			1
@entity53 – who scored 50 goals for @entity2 in the mid-nineties - agrees			1
' the jury is still out on the manager and the signings , ' he told the @entity59 , ' and a good start is huge for them			2
' but i 've always had sympathy with @entity19 and i think he has n't been helped at all by the owner in the past couple of seasons			2
' he has n't had the money when he 's needed it and they 've struggled because of that , it 's frustrating			0
' respected radio commentator @entity71 has covered the club for more than 20 years and , while siding with @entity53 , he feels @entity19 is now under pressure to return on the £ 30million investment			1
on the hunt : the @entity2 manager has made seven summer signings so far main man : @entity80 ( centre ) seems to have hit the ground running in a @entity2 shirt ' there was always a feeling that he was a manager operating with one hand tied behind his back – well that hand has been loosened now , ' he said			1
' last season will not be forgotten if they start badly , but the fixture computer has been kind and he has to take advantage of that			0
there is no excuse that he has not been backed by the owner this time			0
' and what of that backing ? to give the sudden splurge some perspective , the arrival of @entity101 from @entity102 for £ 1.6million in june was the club 's first permanent signing in 17 months			0
their soccer - market sweep has again seen them journey down the autoroutes of the continent , picking up @entity115 midfielder @entity114 and @entity118 internationals @entity116 and @entity119 , as well as @entity120 striker @entity80 , @entity121 forward @entity122 and , a lot closer to home , @entity125 from @entity126			0
and @entity2 's @entity71 added : ' in terms of numbers and quality it 's better than we ever expected			2
the likes of @entity114 , @entity116 and @entity133 are top - class players and fit that mould of @entity136 and @entity137 , internationals who were then sold for a big profit			0
' jury still out : @entity53 ( left ) believes a good start is crucial for under - fire @entity19 @entity53 admits to a sense of anticipation , although he is scarred by the experience of @entity145			1
they splashed more than £ 100m on seven new players 12 months ago but both @entity148 and then @entity149 – assisted by @entity53 – were sacked before the season 's end			2
' you look at the players @entity2 have brought in and you 'd say it 's been a very good summer and i can see why fans might be excited again , ' he said			1
' i have been to watch @entity119 play for @entity158 a good few times and he is a top player			0
' it will be interesting to see how that translates to the @entity13 because i thought he was very good in @entity118			0
' but i was at @entity145 last year and we spent a lot of money on new signings and everyone expected us to challenge for the league			2
' it did n't happen that way and you 'll probably find @entity145 come back better this season for those lads having had a year to settle in			0
' that could be the same at @entity2 , but has the manager got that time ? ' the answer to @entity53 's question , of course , is dependent on results			1
the @entity2 boss has been afforded more time than many anticipated – new signings have helped see to that			1
but time and goodwill have a limited shelf - life at @entity186			0
@entity19 must hope his new goods are not faulty			2
@entity188 : @entity115 midfielder @entity114 ( left ) in action during a pre-season friendly chief scout @entity191 and new managing director @entity192 have been the brains behind @entity2 's summer spree			1
encouraged by @entity48 , @entity191 was the man who originally brought about their @entity7 transfer policy , and he has repaid his wages 100 times over			0
here are their best buys ... 2010 @entity200 - £ 3.5m from @entity201 – 119/1 ( apps / goals ) – still at club @entity205 – free – 57/29 – sold for £ 7m to @entity206 2011 @entity207 - £ 2m from @entity208 – 86/14 – still at club @entity136 - £ 4.8m from @entity210 – 93/18 – sold for £ 20m to @entity211 2012 @entity212 - £ 9m from @entity213 – 78/30 – still at club 2013 @entity137 - £ 5m from @entity210 – 46/1 – sold for £ 12m to @entity215 @entity216 - £ 2m from @entity217 – 56/6 – still at club and as for 2014 ... @entity101 - £ 1.6m from @entity102 @entity125 – free from @entity126 @entity119 - £ 6m from @entity158 @entity114 - £ 12m from @entity219 @entity80 - £ 5m from @entity120 @entity116 - £ 5m from @entity220 @entity122 – season loan from @entity222 @entity23 - £ 3m from @entity30 * @entity22 - £ 2m from @entity30 * * loaned back to @entity30 for season			0
