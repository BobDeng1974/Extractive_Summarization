by @entity0 locals in @entity2 could not believe their eyes when they spotted a bright pink pigeon flying around their street			1
@entity6 , 58 , saw the unusual bird , which has white and pink plumage and a grey head , flying around the street as he ate his breakfast			1
the regional sales manager , from @entity13 , captured the images of the bird only seconds before it flew away			2
@entity6 photographed the unusual pink pigeon after it landed on the roof of his @entity2 home he said : ' i saw a pink bird on the roof on the house opposite me and i could n’t believe my eyes			1
' it looked very unusual so i grabbed my camera because i did n’t think anyone would believe me if i told them what i ’d seen			0
' i went back to get a picture but it had gone so i thought i ’d missed my chance			0
' thankfully it re-appeared about 15 minutes later so i got the pictures quickly then it flew away			0
' i ’ve never heard of a pink pigeon before so who knows where its from			2
' @entity39 , 27 , posted images of the unusual bird on her @entity43 account after it landed in her back garden			0
mr @entity6 said he had to take a photograph of the unusual bird , with pink and white plumage and grey head because no - one would believe him otherwise she said : ' i have just been sitting at home and a pink pigeon has landed on my shed roof			1
is it real ? ' i have googled it and sure enough there are pink pigeons			0
' bit of nice news for a change			0
' another resident , @entity60 , thought the bird had been painted in tribute to the @entity65 @entity64 squad after spotting it only minutes before they took to the field against @entity69 , 57 , said : “ i just saw it there and realised it had been painted white and red , to look like the @entity65 flag			1
' i have to say as supporting @entity65 goes , this is a bit too much and i would class it as cruelty and a bit beyond a joke if that was the case			0
' there is a known breed of pink pigeon , called nesoenas mayeri , which are native to @entity85 , but they are incredibly rare and are almost completely white			1
but the cause of the pigeon ’s pink hue is not known , however , a diet of high levels of beta carotene and canthaxanthin which are harmless natural food pigments .			2

resident @entity6 spotted the multi-*colour*ed bird flying around his road
the pigeon has pink and white plumage and a ' *normal* ' grey head
the bird may have changed *colour* after *eating* too much pink food
