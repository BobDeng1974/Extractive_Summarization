by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 10:04 est , 7 september 2012 a keen horsewoman died after being crushed by a ‘ precariously balanced ’ hay bale just months after warning about the dangers at a livery stable , an inquest heard today			1
@entity7 @entity6 , was killed when the giant hay bale weighing a ton fell on her at the stables where she kept her daughter @entity11 ’s horse , @entity13			1
mrs @entity6 had kept the horse at @entity15 , which has an equestrian centre with a riding school , for several years			1
but tragedy struck in may last year when mrs @entity6 , 45 , went to the stables to help ‘ muck out ’ @entity11 ’s horse after returning from a family holiday			1
crushed : @entity22 was killed by a one - ton hay bale only months after warning of the risk of such an incident , an inquest has heard an inquest into her death at @entity29 was told that @entity30 died almost instantly after being struck by the hay bale covered in black plastic			1
giving evidence 13 - year - old @entity11 told how her mother had warned of an accident occurring with the hay bales prior to her death			1
she said : ‘ a few months before the accident my mum said " i bet one day one of them is going to fall " because she was n’t as happy as she should have been with the way that they were stacked			2
the girl said she went to the stables with her mother every evening at around 5pm			2
mrs @entity6 , @entity46 manager at @entity47 , would begin mucking out duties whilst @entity11 rode her horse around the stables			1
@entity11 said her mother suffered from a bad back causing her to ‘ hunch over ’ meaning she preferred to get hay from a trough within the stables rather than access the bales			1
however , on a number of occasions clients were forced to access the hay bales as the trough ‘ was more often than not empty ’			0
she said : ‘ we never opened a bale at the bottom of the stack and would know not to open one supporting the stack			2
it would make it unstable or fall it was common sense			0
’ on may 31 last year , the last time @entity11 saw her mother alive was as she stood next to a stack of hay bales around five metres high			1
@entity69 and @entity70 , @entity71 said : ‘ @entity11 went to muck out the horse and @entity7 went to collect some hay			1
' precariously balanced ' : a giant hay bale fell on @entity30 at @entity15 , an equestrian centre with a riding school ‘ but after her mother left @entity11 heard a scream a few moments later and found her mother on the floor with a hay bale near her feet and another by her side			1
‘ @entity11 called for help but @entity7 had already succumbed to her death			1
’ @entity11 held her mother ’s hand and squeezed it but mrs @entity6 did not respond , the court heard			1
emergency services were called to the farm in @entity90 but @entity30 , who lived with her husband @entity91 at @entity92 , near @entity93 , was pronounced dead later the same day			1
four days after @entity30 ’s death the farm in @entity95 , @entity96 , was visited by a number of health and safety experts			0
@entity101 , an environmental health officer for @entity102 , told the jury he found an almost empty plastic wrapper at the bottom of the hay bale stack			2
he said : ‘ this empty wrapper was obviously a full bale at one time but hay had been taken from it on a regular basis and this had caused instability in the stack above			2
‘ the stack was precariously balanced and as the bale below got emptier it provided less support , causing it to collapse			2
’ mr @entity101 said stable owner @entity119 claimed that she had repeatedly tried to stop clients from accessing hay bales			0
he said : ‘ she told me she was red hot about this and told them regularly not to do it and to prevent it she had purchased a large wheeled trough which she kept stacked up with hay			0
’ ' the stack was precariously balanced and as the bale below got emptier it provided less support , causing it to collapse ' mrs @entity119 who runs the equine centre with her husband , @entity132 , told inspectors on the day of the accident the trough had contained hay			0
however , detective sergeant @entity136 from @entity137 said that during his inspection of the site the day after @entity30 ’s death the trough was ‘ completely empty			0
’ @entity141 from the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) said he became ‘ very concerned ’ about the safety of the stack during a visit to the farm following the incident			0
he said : ‘ we were reluctant to leave the centre because we thought the stacking at the stables was unsafe			0
‘ the front and back stack was not tied together and they were free standing			0
we had concerns about the structural integrity of the stack			0
’ @entity159 , agricultural expert at the @entity142 , told the court he had major concerns after he found the stack ‘ dangerously ’ leaning towards one side			0
he ordered the couple to reassemble the stack immediately as clients including children were still using the stables			0
he said : ‘ we were not prepared to leave the site until the stack had been made safe			0
‘ it was a major concern as the stack was not tied together and the left hand row was leaning over			0
’ pathologist @entity174 told the court that @entity30 had died from multiple injuries including collapsed lungs and internal bleeding caused by the weight of the hay bale .			2
