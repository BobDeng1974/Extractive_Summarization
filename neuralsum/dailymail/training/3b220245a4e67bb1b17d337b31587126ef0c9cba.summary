former @entity1 chairman @entity0 has backed calls for a @entity4 boycott to force @entity5 to introduce more reforms and admitted that some of @entity9 's tactics in pursuing votes for its 2018 bid were ' unwise '			1

his successor at the @entity1 , @entity19 , who stepped down from the post in 2013 , has called for @entity22 to lead a boycott of the 2018 @entity4 in @entity24			1
@entity0 ( left ) backed the call for a boycott of the 2018 @entity4 in @entity24 @entity19 called for the boycott , saying @entity5 need to be forced to introduce reforms @entity0 ( right ) supported the idea of @entity22 leading the boycott of the 2018 @entity4 @entity0 told @entity30 : ' @entity19 has been saying @entity22 should get its act together and preferably do it together and i think he 's got an extremely strong point and i support it			1
' @entity34 and @entity22 should be saying ' if you want the @entity36 involved in this world sport then it 's got to be a clean sport run in a transparent way and to standards that are exacting '			2
' @entity24 will of course resist it but the fact of the matter is the most powerful of all the continental football groups is in a position to influence it , as are the major sponsors and i think until @entity5 is confronted by that it will never change			0
' ethics judge @entity48 last week made a number of criticisms of @entity9 2018 's tactics in trying to win the vote of now - disgraced former @entity5 vice-president @entity53 , including securing a job for an associate of his and picking up the bill for a Â£ 35,000 gala dinner			0
@entity0 added : ' i think the pursuit of some people and their votes was probably done in a way that was unwise			1
maybe i would say that			0
' people used to complain because i and @entity53 could n't bear to be in the same room as one another so the idea that we were cosy with each other never occurred and there were no exchanges of promises or gifts in that period			0
' in my view it would have been much more sensible for @entity9 to have been at greater arm 's lengths of someone like @entity53			0
i said that at the time so i 'm not saying anything new today			0
' @entity0 said he had wanted to speak to @entity16 but had been prevented from doing so as he was being sued at the time - unsuccessfully , by @entity81 's @entity5 member @entity80 - and had been advised not to do so as the case was sub judice .			2
