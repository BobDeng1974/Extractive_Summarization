@entity0 are continuing to discuss the possibility of new additions to their squad should @entity4 get money to spend			1
a goalkeeper and striker remain the objectives but key could be the departure of £ 10million - rated @entity11			1
@entity12 remain interested but the @entity13 is not keen to join and @entity14 have yet to firm up tentative interest			1
@entity11 is clearly surplus to requirements but wanted to fight for his place with @entity0 short on in - form and fit strikers			1
the @entity19 would also likely have to pay @entity11 to leave and that is not something they are overly keen to do			1
@entity0 striker @entity11 could leave the club in january with @entity14 and @entity12 both keen @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity25 of @entity26 are names in the frame for the goalkeeping position but these deals are not straightforward for january			1
@entity32 's @entity31 remains a player @entity4 likes but his cost will see any deal likely shelved until the summer and the loan market may be @entity0 's best route			1
@entity39 confirmed that @entity0 have yet to make any call on bringing in @entity41 ahead of schedule but , when asked , @entity39 director @entity38 said : ' @entity43 to @entity0 ? we have n't received any proposal , but they could offer £ 5.5m in january			1
' meetings will continue this week over potential targets			0
@entity32 striker @entity31 is a long - term target for @entity0 boss @entity4 @entity0 are also considering moves for @entity24 's @entity23 ( left ) and @entity26 's @entity25 ( right0 @entity51 is unlikely to join @entity52 despite being a free agent			1
manager @entity54 , who remains keen on @entity56 's @entity55 and @entity57 plus @entity59 's @entity58 , wanted to sign the former @entity61 midfielder @entity51 in the summer after his fall - out with @entity63			1
however , after delays in his release paperwork from @entity63 , @entity54 moved for @entity66 at @entity56 instead			0
@entity51 , 29 , has been training with @entity68 's head of medicine and sports science @entity71 to maintain his fitness and , if anything , would prefer to join up with his former colleague at @entity75			1
former @entity76 midfielder @entity51 ( left ) is unlikely to join @entity52 as a free agent @entity51 worked with @entity71 at @entity76 and has always held the @entity78 in high regard			1
@entity51 though also has offers to return to @entity81 while there are clubs in @entity84 and @entity85 also showing an interest			1
@entity52 , who have opened talks about a new contract for striker @entity90 , will likely have to deal in loans or free transfers , even more rare at this time of year , as they remain fearful of what punishment they will be given over breach of financial fair play guidelines			1
rangers are expected to face a substantial fine because in 2012 - 13 , which resulted in relegation to the @entity101 , the club lost £ 65m despite earning @entity103 income of £ 61m			2
@entity52 paid their staff , including players , £ 78m in the year to may 31 , 2013			2
@entity56 winger @entity57 ( left ) is a transfer target for @entity52 boss @entity54 if , in their promotion season @entity52 did not cut their wage bill enough to compensate for the loss of @entity103 income and made a loss as high as the previous year , they could face a fine of £ 54m			2
the rules impose a fine of approximately £ 7m for a loss to £ 18m , then pound for pound above that			0
the club will be told of their punishment before january 1			2
@entity121 are watching @entity123 midfielder @entity122 and @entity125 's @entity124			1

@entity123 midfielder @entity122 ( centre ) is being watched by @entity126 , @entity121 , @entity127 and @entity128 @entity141 will demand £ 25m for @entity59 target @entity142			1
the @entity145 midfielder only joined the @entity147 side from @entity24 for last summer in a deal worth £ 18m			0
city are scouting alternatives should @entity151 fail to agree terms on his contract and @entity142 is a player with limited @entity103 experience but one who can play a number of roles			0
the 23 - year - old can play left or right wing and behind the striker and has scored six goals this season			2
he left @entity163 as he wanted to play regular football and that would be another consideration should @entity26 follow up their interest			0
@entity141 want £ 25million from @entity59 for @entity145 international @entity142 ( right ) @entity26 will evaluate the returns of @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 before considering moves in january			0

representatives from clubs across the country were out in force last week to watch @entity195 holders @entity193 at @entity188 , many waiting to see @entity193 's latest prospects but it was 18 - year - old @entity187 who stole the spotlight with a hat - trick as @entity188 ran out 3 - 1 winners			0

@entity210 ' @entity209 is weighing up a return to @entity212			0
@entity209 , who was wanted by @entity12 and @entity52 last summer , believes he could continue playing for another four seasons , into his 40th year and said : ' i 've got another year left on my @entity210 contract			1
the main feeling for me is every time i 'm at a club , i like to be there for a long time			0
' to be totally honest , i could have gone back to the @entity103 on loan after the @entity221 and i decided to stay with @entity210 for the remainder of the season and still ( have ) options to go back to the @entity103 if it 's the right one for me			0
' so when you put everything into one , the decision i make will be a methodical one , like i 've always made it			0

@entity242 made his debut in 1970 , aged 16 years and 139 days and @entity240 , now boss at @entity246 said : ' i think before the season finishes he will play in the first team and break @entity242 ’ record			0
i think he 's that good			0
at 15 years of age to be considered for first team football is an unbelievable achievement and tells you about the player			0
