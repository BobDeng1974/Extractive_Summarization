by @entity0 published : 12:47 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 12:49 est , 14 january 2013 @entity2 scientists are celebrating successfully bringing up a sample from an @entity5 lake that has been buried beneath ice for at least 100,000 years			1
the announcement was made just weeks after a @entity9 expedition to extract water from an @entity5 lake gave up and headed for home			0
the @entity2 team initially drilled more than two miles into ice to reach the surface of @entity15 last year			1
the @entity2 expedition posing after breaking through to @entity15 in 2012			1
they managed to bring up a sample , some of which was served to president @entity21 , but it was uncertain if the water can from the lake or the glacier above it			0
having returned to @entity5 the scientific team extracted a further sample which , according to the @entity2 state - owned news agency @entity28 , was from the lake itself			0
the project team relied on the huge pressure the lake is under to force water up into last year ’s borehole where it froze and could be extracted in cores , it was reported			0
‘ the first core of transparent lake ice , 2 meters long , was obtained on january 10 [ 2013 ] at a depth of 3,406 meters , ’ the @entity40 and @entity41 , part of the @entity43 , was quoted as saying			0
‘ inside it was a vertical channel filled with white bubble - rich ice			0
’ the core is now to be tested to see if any microbial life has persisted @entity15 , which at 1,300 cubic miles in volume is the largest lake in @entity5 and one of the biggest in the world			1
there are more than 400 sub-glacial lakes in @entity5 and they are attracting scientific attention in part because they represent environments similar to those that might harbour life elsewhere in the solar system , such as @entity65 's frozen @entity64			1
analysis of samples from last year ’s @entity15 expedition yielded nothing alive except for a few microbes which are feared to have been through contamination			1
the @entity72 gave up its attempt to break through to @entity74 in december			0
however , a @entity76 - led @entity5 expedition announced in november that they had detected microbes thriving in the slushy centre of the otherwise frozen @entity80			2
the microbes had been sealed off by ice for at least 2,800 years and were living without oxygen in salty , acidic water which would be toxic to many lifeforms			2
in @entity15 any microbes would have to have survived frozen beneath ice for at least 100,000 years and perhaps for millions of years			1
in december the @entity9 @entity87 had to abandon an attempt to reach @entity74 through almost 1.8 miles of ice by drilling with water at close to boiling point			2
it was defeated by technical problems at it tried to link the main borehole with a secondary hole that was to be used to syphon off water .			0

@entity15 is buried more than two miles below the surface
@entity99 for microbes could *provide* vital clues to *extra-terrestrial* life
