the show the @entity8 , a satellite galaxy of the @entity10 nearly 200,000 light - years from @entity11			1
vast clouds of gas within it slowly collapse to form new stars , which light up the gas clouds in a riot of colours , as revealed in this image from the @entity22 / @entity21 @entity5			1
' the @entity8 is in an ideal position for astronomers to study the phenomena surrounding star formation , ' the @entity30 said			1
' it lies in a fortuitous location in the sky , far enough from the plane of the @entity10 that it is neither outshone by too many nearby stars , nor obscured by the dust in the @entity10 's centre			2
' it is also close enough to study in detail ( less than a tenth of the distance of the @entity46 , the closest spiral galaxy ) , and lies almost face - on to us , giving us a bird 's eye view			2
' @entity50 120 - @entity49 ( known as @entity49 for short ) is a particularly bright region of the @entity8 , consisting of several adjacent pockets of gas and star formation			1
the data in this image were identified by @entity57 , an astronomy teacher at @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , in the @entity5 's ' @entity62 ' image processing competition			0
the competition invited members of the public to dig out unreleased scientific data from @entity5 's vast archive , and to process them into stunning images			0
this image shows the top ten images entered into the @entity5 's @entity62 image processing competition : top row : @entity73 1763 by @entity57 , m 77 by @entity74 der @entity75 , @entity76 by @entity77 , @entity78 by @entity79 , m 96 by @entity81 row : @entity82 0519 - 69 by @entity83 , @entity84 111 - 2.1 by @entity85 , @entity73 by kyokugaisha1 , @entity87 68 by @entity88 , @entity89 10 by @entity90 a mysterious ' green blob ' spotted by @entity5 in 2007 is one of many iconic images the space telescope has captured			0
