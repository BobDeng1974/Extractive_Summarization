by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor prime minister @entity2 hopes to woo @entity4 voters with his promise of an in - out @entity7 referendum if he wins the 2015 general election @entity2 has ordered a ‘ war on two fronts ’ to counter the duel threat of @entity10 and @entity4 between now and the general @entity12 prime minister hopes to counter the threat of @entity4 with a ‘ blue - on - purple ’ battle focused on reviving his bid to legislated for an in - out @entity7 referendum			1
and he will target @entity20 in a ‘ blue - on - red ’ over the stewardship of the economy and exploiting voters ’ doubts about the @entity26 ’s ability to run the country			1
in a major boost for the prime minister , it was announced today that a backbench @entity32 mp will launch a second bid to enshrine the pledge of an in - out @entity7 referendum in law			1
former minister @entity37 was the highest placed conservative mp drawn at random this morning			1
he will resurrect the @entity38 unsuccessfully proposed by colleague @entity39 in the last parliamentary session			0
mr @entity37 said : ‘ one of the first votes i ever cast was on @entity7 membership in the 1970s			1
‘ now , as i pick up my bus pass , i am getting the chance to work with colleagues to secure a referendum for the @entity49 people			2
‘ @entity49 needs a new deal with @entity51 and the @entity32 have a plan for change in @entity51 - renegotiate , reform and put the deal to the @entity49 people in an in - out referendum by the end of 2017			2
‘ @entity58 now has the chance to pass my backbench bill and guarantee that the @entity49 people have the final say			0
’ some conservatives complain that mr @entity2 ’s promise of a referendum , first made in january last year , has failed to cut through to voters			2
he vowed to renegotiate @entity49 ’s membership of the @entity7 before putting it to the @entity49 public			2
it is seen as a key weapon in the attack on @entity4 ’s support base			2
@entity32 strategists have set a deadline of the party conference season in october to build the foundation for an outright majority at the general election in may next year			0
the @entity32 have been buoyed by winning the @entity78 by - election , despite mr @entity81 ’s claims his @entity82 was on the march to an historic victory			0
many @entity32 mps are privately delighted that the party won on an optimistic message of a ‘ brighter future ’ , which had echoes of mr @entity2 ’s early leadership when he declared : ‘ let sunshine win the day			0
’ the prime minister has told aides to fight a war on two fronts : targeting @entity20 's @entity10 and @entity81 's @entity4 number 10 was especially struck by a poll from @entity78 which showed support for @entity4 was much weaker among women			1
meanwhile , the @entity99 will contrast mr @entity2 with mr @entity20 , with polls showing barely a quarter of voters think the @entity10 is up to the of being prime minister			1
a source close to mr @entity2 told @entity1 : ‘ the pm describes it as a war on two fronts			0
@entity32 mp @entity37 is to try to legislate for an in - out referendum , in the face of opposition from the @entity108 and @entity10 ‘ between now and the conference season we have got to show we are more economically competent than @entity10 and set out a more optimistic vision than @entity4			1
‘ it is blue - on - red and blue - on - purple			1
over the next few months you will see much more about what we would without being in coalition			0
’ the prime minister has said he is ready to invoke the @entity118 to force through referendum legislation , after mr @entity39 ’s bill collapsed in january in the face of @entity10 and @entity108 opposition in the @entity122			1
the @entity99 have been forced to fall back on private members ’ legislation as their @entity108 coalition partners have refused to sanction a @entity127 bill , which would have much greater prospects of success			0
for the @entity118 to apply , a bill identical to that proposed by mr @entity39 would have to pass the @entity132 without any amendments - which may prove difficult to achieve			0
even if the @entity32 can not get a bill into law , @entity32 strategists believe they can still gain by forcing @entity10 and the @entity108 to vote against a measure that is popular with many voters just months - or weeks - before a general election if they want to block it			1
@entity143 , chief executive of @entity144 , said : ‘ voters support a referendum , business supports a referendum and so must @entity58			0
‘ the @entity7 has changed dramatically over the past 40 years and the overwhelming message from the @entity51 elections is that voters want their chance to have a say			0
‘ this @entity152 ’ @entity38 provides a genuine opportunity to give people that chance , which is why @entity85 must not only back this @entity38 , but they should not be afraid to use the @entity118 if peers fail to give the public what they want			0
