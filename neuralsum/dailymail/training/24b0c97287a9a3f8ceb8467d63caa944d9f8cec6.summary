as a nation we are becoming a loveless lot , turning our backs on our partners as soon as we settle down , not bothering to kiss each other good night or say i love you and in 25 per cent of cases hoping that our partners do n't even touch us as we try and drift to sleep			1
but despite our efforts to ward off intimacy as we are trying to fall asleep , psychologists say it is the positions we take up when actually deep in sleep that reveal how we really feel about each other			1
the positions we sleep in can say a lot about our relationships : the @entity42 - back to back but not touching - shows a couple feels connected whilst independent enough to sleep separately during sleep , you can not fake your body language , this is the time when you are honest and vulnerable and your sleeping position can therefore reveal a lot about your relationship			1

@entity52 said : ' couples fall into habitual ways of sleeping together that suits their personalities and personal preferences			2

arguments often lead to sleeping wide apart , as people feel loathe to touch			2
' ' inevitably , once the first flush of lust wears off , with couples naked and entwined , it is more likely that the need for a good night 's sleep predominates , so sleeping back to back becomes a favourable position in bed			1
