the company that was due to make the scratchproof sapphire glass screen for the @entity3 it still in crisis and may be forced to shut down , it has been revealed			1
@entity6 , a former stock market darling and supplier to @entity3 , filed for bankruptcy on oct 6 in a stunning turn of events for a company whose fortunes looked bright only a few months ago			1
@entity3 said on thursday that @entity6 's ' ambitious ' vision of sapphire manufacturing was ultimately not quite ready for primetime			1
@entity3 's watch uses a sapphire glass screen - but the firm that makes it may have to shut down synthetic sapphire is a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			1
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity3 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity37 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity38 and to protects the phone 's camera			0
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity43 currently used in most high - end smartphones			2
few details have emerged since the bankruptcy filing , which wiped out most of @entity6 's market value and triggered speculation over what may have soured its relationship with @entity3			1
but on thursday , @entity3 , which had backed the development with @entity6 of a sapphire - manufacturing plant in @entity53 , said it will keep an eye on @entity6 's advances , holding open the possibility of doing business with it in future			1
' @entity3 put a lot of effort into an ambitious new sapphire manufacturing process with @entity6 which is not ready for production			1
' we 're going to continue evaluating @entity6 's progress on larger sapphire boule development , as well as consider other options for the facility , ' spokeswoman @entity69 said , referring to raw cylinders of the material			2
at the heart of @entity6 's bankruptcy filing was a deal struck with @entity3 in november 2013			2
@entity6 was to have used the @entity53 plant to make scratch - resistant sapphire exclusively for @entity3			1
that sapphire was to have eventually found its way into future mobile devices , such as @entity80 - where it 's already in use in their fingerprint sensors - or the upcoming @entity3			0
on thursday , @entity6 said it will continue ' technical exchanges ' with @entity3 on making larger , next - generation sapphire boules , raw cylinders of the material that effectively increase capacity and lower the unit cost of production			1
@entity6 said it would expand into boules of more than 165 kg , from the current 115 kg. on thursday , @entity6 also laid out the details of an agreement struck and described in court on tuesday			0
@entity3 ceo @entity94 shows off the new @entity38 6 and the @entity3 during an @entity3 special event at the @entity96 for the @entity97 on september 9			0
both products use sapphire glass - the watch for its screen , and the phone for its touch id fingerprint sensor under that pact , @entity6 will stop making sapphire materials for now and focus on supplying equipment to make sapphire crystals			1
@entity6 said it would be released from all exclusivity obligations with @entity3 and a mechanism would be provided for the @entity38 maker to recover its $ 439 million pre-payment to the company , without interest			2
at a hearing this week at the @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity6 said the expected deal with @entity3 would save money and allow it to be more open about its mysterious chapter 11 filing			2
@entity6 said on thursday it would wind down its sapphire production factories in @entity123 , @entity53 and @entity124 , @entity117			0
it has laid off about 650 employees at the @entity123 plant and expects additional job cuts in @entity124			0
@entity6 will retain control of its intellectual property and will be able to sell its sapphire fabrication technology without restrictions , it said in a statement .			0

@entity6 has been working with @entity3 on sapphire glass plant
filed for bankruptcy last week
@entity3 says it will ' continue to evaluate the firm ' but admits it is looking at other options to source screen
