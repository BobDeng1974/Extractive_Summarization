a mother - of - two has spoken of how irritable bowel syndrome left her in agony and killed her sex life			1
@entity4 , 45 , had suffered from the condition since the birth of her younger daughter @entity7 12 years ago			1
she lived with a constantly bloated stomach and persistent pain down her right side , which left her feeling miserable			1
pain : @entity4 with her husband , @entity14			1
she suffered excruciating @entity16 symptoms after the birth of her second daughter 12 years ago , leaving her feeling unattractive she told @entity18 : ' the pain was horrific			1
it was on my right side - where the belt loop is when you wear jeans			0
i used to say i wanted to go in with an apple corer and pull it out			0
' eight years ago it became so bad that she was hospitalised			1
doctors quickly diagnosed her with @entity16 , prescribing her with diclofenic anti-inflammatory tablets			1
one in five people in the western world suffers with @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , a gut disorder characterised by diarrhoea , stomach cramps and bloating			1
and while the painkillers helped with the pain slightly , they did nothing to ease her severe bloating			2
happier times : @entity46 and @entity14 when they were younger			2
she says their relationship is now back on track after she discovered a treatment for her ibs symptoms , which had left her bloated and not wanting sex mrs @entity4 said : ' i was so bloated that i could n't wear jeans in the car if i was going on a long journey as it was so painful			1
i would feel like i had eaten a really , really big meal , even though i had n't			0
' and whenever i ate anything like bread , my symptoms would flare up			0
i regularly found myself doubled over with pain for three to four days whenever i ate white bread and had to resort to cutting it out completely			1
' i would n't be able to go to the loo for three or four days at a time , either			0
' the pain and bloating left her feeling miserable and unattractive - and her relationship with her husband @entity14 , 44 , also suffered			1
many women ( with and without @entity16 ) experience variations in gut symptoms – including abdominal pain , diarrhoea , bloating , and constipation – during their menstrual cycle			1
abdominal pain and diarrhoea tend to increase in the pre-menstrual phase of the cycle and reach a maximum on the first to second day of menstrual flow			0
bloating and constipation , on the other hand , tend to increase post-ovulation ( around day 14 ) and stay increased until the day before or the first day of menstrual flow			0
source : @entity92 she said : ' between the stomach ache and the fact it felt like a balloon and looked awful , i just did n't feel sexy or have any enthusiasm in the bedroom			0
' i was always scared that sex would hurt and that put me off doing it			0
in the end , i just did n't want to do it at all - and did n't for about two years			0
' she says that stress made her symptoms worse - and the fact her husband had been diagnosed with a cavernoma - clusters of abnormal blood vessels around the brain - plaguing him with constant headaches on a daily basis , only made matters worse			2
' i do think the stress of @entity14 's illness made my @entity16 symptoms worse , ' she said			1
although very much under - reported , one of the most common side - effects of @entity16 is a low sex drive			1
many patients , both men and women , also say the condition makes sex painful , too			0
a recent survey by @entity128 revealed that one in three women with @entity16 also have such embarrassing symptoms that their sex life suffers as a result , leading to strained relationships			1
the survey also demonstrated that the majority 's self confidence had dwindled since their diagnosis			0
struggle : @entity46 with her daughters @entity7 and @entity141			0
she says her @entity16 often left her doubled over in pain relief : since discovering a supplement she takes in her morning cup of tea , @entity46 's symptoms have disappeared and she is no longer in agony frustrated with no solution for her swollen stomach , mrs @entity4 began searching online for an answer - and found a ' good bacteria ' supplement on @entity154			1
called @entity156 , it 's a prebiotic , which ' feeds ' probiotics - so - called ‘ friendly ’ or ‘ good ’ bacteria which play a number of vital roles in the body including helping to regulate the immune system , aiding the digestion and absorption of food , producing essential vitamins , and contributing to digestive health			1
happy : @entity46 says all aspects of her life have improved prebiotics are a special type of complex carbohydrate that probiotics thrive on			0
they feed and increase the ‘ good ’ types of bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria without feeding the ‘ bad ’ types			2
mrs @entity4 said : ' i got sent a sample pack of the prebiotic powder and added it to my cup of tea in the morning			2
' within days i felt so much better and do n't even need to take it every day			0
' the pain has gone , my stomach has got flatter and i can eat bread and my favourite foods again , such as baguettes , brioche and croissants			2
' best of all , @entity14 and i now have a much better relationship and things are really good in the bedroom again			2
' last year , she forgot to take @entity156 over the @entity201 period , due to the stress of the holidays			0
' my symptoms returned instantly and i was doubled over with stomach pains , struggling to even stand up straight			2
' within hours of taking the powder my symptoms had vanished			0
it seems to be the only thing that keeps them under control			0

@entity4 , 45 , developed the condition 12 years ago after *childbirth*
had a constantly bloated stomach and persistent pain down her right side
was hospitalised due to the pain eight years ago and diagnosed with @entity16
had to stop eating food such as bread as it left her doubled up in pain
felt so *uncomfortable* that her sex life with husband @entity14 , 44 , suffered
