by @entity0 published : 02:24 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 13:25 est , 23 august 2012 @entity1 says @entity2 is exploiting the pandas for cash under the guise of conservation an animal protection charity has condemned @entity2 for offering visitors the chance to become panda keepers - if they stump up £ 1,000 for an hour			1
@entity1 , an @entity2 - based animal protection charity , has called the scheme ‘ exploitative ’ and claim it is a money spinning scheme thinly - veiled as a conservation project			1
the new ' experience ' was launched yesterday and provides panda fans with the opportunity of a private , after hours , encounter with the @entity19 's only giant pandas			2
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ as much as it ’s portrayed as a conservation project , this is a commercial exercise and these pandas are being exploited to generate revenue for the zoo			2
‘ our primary concern is the welfare of the pandas and we would expect that because the zoo has a large financial stake in their well - being , they will do their utmost to ensure they do n’t come to any harm			1
' we would urge the zoo to demonstrate how the pandas will be protected from any physical or psychological pressure that may be caused by this process			0
‘ it ’s quite an obscene amount of money to ask for in the current economic climate and it seems almost a throwback to the @entity48 era when animals were used as entertainment			0
it ’s a bit tacky			0
‘ the pandas are the property of the @entity56 government and we hope they have consulted with them about exploiting the animals in this way			1
‘ if people love pandas that much , would it not be better to donate that money to conservation efforts to protect their habitat ? ’ come play with me ! visitors can get up close and personal with male panda @entity70 at @entity2 in @entity71 who would n't want to give her a bear hug ? those willing to fork out could hand - feed @entity76 the female panda visitors can now get up close to female @entity76 ( @entity79 ) and male @entity70 ( @entity80 ) for the first time but for a fee			1
the zoo is offering the hour long panda keeper experience at £ 1,000 for up to four people , where visitors can meet the creatures which spend up to 14 hours a day sleeping			1
customers are being charged per panda keeper experience meaning that at it 's lowest , the ' experience ' costs £ 250 per person if four people are using it - they same amount charged for a full day keeper experience with other animals			1
at its highest , the keeper experience will still cost £ 1,000 even if only one person uses it			1
a half an hour rhino keeper experience will only cost you £ 70 , as does an owl , lemur or ' creepy crawly ' keeper experience			1
a spokeswoman for @entity2 said : ' @entity106 is not about extra income			1
' to date we have welcomed over 400,000 people to visit the giant pandas at @entity2 and in terms of projections made before their arrival , we are happy with the numbers			1
' similar experiences take place in zoos around with world with pandas , including @entity56 , and are extremely exclusive and limited experiences , with only around 2 to 4 taking place each month			1
' it is important to remember that @entity123 is a charity and receives no external funding and that our conservation programmes , including panda support , are achieved because of funds from our zoo activities and how they uniquely reconnect people with vanishing nature			1
' conservation remains one of the @entity123 key goals regarding giant pandas and is at the heart of everything we do			0
' feed me ! the experience is designed for people over the age of 16 and offers a chance to get close to the @entity56 imports the adorable , clumsy creatures have been a hit feature of @entity2 - despite sleeping for about 14 hours a day the giant pandas arrived at @entity2 from @entity56 in december 2011 - the first pandas kept in @entity19 since 1994			1
the @entity149 project is funded entirely from charitable donations from the @entity123			0
the zoo pays the @entity56 government £ 660,000 a year to house the black and white pair , poured £ 285,000 into building a special enclosure for them , and spends £ 70,000 a year on bamboo imported from @entity158 for them , the @entity151 reported			1
@entity160 , head of animals at @entity2 , said : ' we 're delighted to be able to offer people the chance to get closer than ever before to these fascinating , rare and iconic animals			2
though it belongs to the order @entity168 , the panda 's diet is 99 per cent bamboo			0
pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses , wild tubers , or even meat in the form of birds , rodents or carrion			0
the giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central @entity56 , mainly in @entity183 province , but also in the @entity185 and @entity186 provinces			2
as a result of farming , deforestation and other development , the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived			0
the panda is a conservation reliant endangered species			0
' our panda keeper experiences , which will last around an hour , are exclusive opportunities for panda fans			0
' unique private encounters , people will be able to see the giant pandas at very close proximity in the private area of their enclosure - which is n't on show to the public			2
' the private audience with our keepers will also give the chance to really learn first - hand more about @entity76 and @entity70			0
' we hope people really enjoy and treasure this incredible and truly rare once in a lifetime experience with our giant pandas			0
' the panda keeper experience allows visitors to meet one of the panda keepers and learn about the training with the pandas			2
visitors may also have the chance to feed the pandas and they will receive drinks and canapes on the panda walkway			0
it had been hoped that the pair would breed cubs but attempts to encourage any romance between them has failed so far			0
the keepers built private rooms linked by a tunnel for @entity76 and @entity70 so they could take advantage of the only 36 hour window when a female panda ovulates , but so far the duo remain just good friends			0
meanwhile , the @entity240 has urged the zoo to take all possible steps to ensure the well - being of both the pandas and the guests			2
@entity240 chief superintendent @entity246 said : ' the biosecurity and safety of both the animals and humans is paramount therefore we would expect @entity2 to have taken all the necessary precautions to ensure these experiences are conducted in an appropriate manner			2
' @entity149 keeper experiences run are designed for people aged 16 years and over .			0

hour - long experience at @entity2 allows visitors to get up close and personal with the black and white creatures
but @entity71 animal charity @entity262 as ' exploitative ' and ' tacky '
zoo pays @entity56 £ 660,000 - a - year to loan the *mammals* and spends £ 70,000 annually just on bamboo
