by @entity0 one shot , one kill : since @entity4 snipers have gone from hate figures to heroes when the fresh - faced 19 - year - old arrived on the @entity10 in august 1943 , his new comrades were delighted			1
for several days , the entire company of the 144th @entity12 of the @entity13 had been pinned down by a solitary @entity15 sniper			1
it was the job of the new arrival ‘ to get him off our backs ’			1
the young man , an @entity22 by the name of @entity24 , was led to a parapet of logs that formed the edge of the trench			1
squinting through a gap , he could see nothing suspicious in @entity31			1
he rolled up a tent and placed a cap on its top — then raised the cap above the level of the logs			1
after no more than a few seconds , the cap was shot off its perch			1
the sniper ’s impetuousness would prove to be an error , because the flash from his rifle revealed his position to @entity24			1
gingerly , he eased the muzzle of his rifle through the gap in the logs			1
he estimated the enemy sniper to be about 100 yards away — so well within range			1
however , as he lined up his target , @entity24 was seized by nerves			1
his heart was racing and the rifle shook			1
he knew the cause : it would be the first time he had killed in cold blood			1
this , he thought , felt more like murder than combat			1
‘ what are you waiting for ? ’ hissed one of his comrades			1
‘ let him have it ! ’ somehow , those words helped @entity24 to calm down			1
he squeezed the trigger and fired — hitting the @entity15 right between the eyes			1
despite earning many pats on his back from his comrades , @entity24 still felt a sense of revulsion at what he had done			1
@entity22 sniper @entity24 , who was sent to the @entity10 as a fresh - faced 19 - year - old and went on to kill 257 men during the course of the war , he would kill 257 men — a tally that makes him one of history ’s deadliest snipers			1
however , none of his kills can match what was achieved in @entity85 last year by an unnamed lance corporal in the @entity87			1
on december 14 , @entity89 troops in @entity90 had spotted a suspected @entity92 suicide bomber on the move and were sent to intercept him			1
a firefight ensued , during which the @entity89 sniper observed a @entity92 fighter armed with an @entity98 climbing out of a ditch			2
a @entity89 sniper team patrolling @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity85 in 2006			2
the sniper that killed six @entity92 with one shot was on one of the last missions carried out by @entity89 troops in @entity85 at a range of half a mile , the lance corporal took aim with his £ 25,000 l115a3 bolt - action sniper rifle , and hit the @entity92 in the torso			1
unknown to the marksman , the terrorist was wearing a suicide vest , which was detonated by the high - velocity round			1
not only was the bomber vaporised , but so , too , were five of his fellow @entity92			2
with just one shot , the @entity89 sniper had killed six of the enemy			1
yesterday , when news of this shot broke , it made headlines around the world , revealing our enduring fascination with snipers			1
the role of the sniper is very different to that of most military men			2
while the majority of soldiers work in units , the sniper usually works alone			2
' unsportsmanlike ' : an @entity140 sniper takes aim from the trenches during @entity4 camouflaged @entity140 snipers during @entity4			2
for the first year of the war , @entity146 snipers , equipped with weapons with advanced sights , wrought havoc in the trenches it is this notion of the sniper as the deadly lone wolf , clinically picking off the enemy from his hiding place , that so fires our imagination			2
however , the sniper has not always been held in such high regard			2
a century ago , sniping was viewed as being against the ‘ rules ’ of warfare			2
though the @entity89 had raised a sniper unit , the @entity165 , during the @entity166 , there were many in the @entity13 who saw sniping as underhand			2
it took the horrors of @entity4 to make the top brass realise that it was an essential part of modern warfare			2
for the first year of the war , @entity146 snipers , equipped with weapons with advanced sights , had wrought havoc in the trenches			2
as one @entity89 general ruefully admitted : ‘ certainly we were slow to adopt — indeed , our souls abhorred — anything unsportsmanlike			2
’ @entity140 soldier private @entity183 peers through the telescopic sight of his modified @entity185 during @entity186 @entity188 sniper @entity187 was the most successful of many female @entity186 snipers with 309 confirmed kills after the @entity4 , nearly every army in the world developed specialist sniper schools			2
marksmanship is just one of the skills that is taught , as snipers also have to perfect the art of concealment			2
they also act as scouts and can learn much about enemy formations through their telescopic sights			2
however , despite their obvious usefulness , by the outbreak of @entity186 , snipers were still poorly regarded by all sides			0
art of camouflage : a @entity15 sniper at the @entity211 front in 1940 in his memoirs , @entity24 recalls how many young officers regarded snipers as ‘ loathsome assassins ’ , and would decline their signatures when a sniper needed a kill confirmed for his record book			1
the most successful sniper ever was a @entity221 called @entity222 , who shot 505 @entity15 during 100 days of the @entity223 between @entity211 and the @entity224 from 1939 to 1940			1
his achievement is all the more extraordinary because he did not use telescopic sights			0
he did n’t appear to have been troubled by his deadly achievement , and claimed never to lose a night ’s sleep over his killing of so many men			0
‘ i only did what i was told to do , as well as i could , ’ he said			0
though sniping is often viewed as ‘ man ’s work ’ , @entity186 also saw many female snipers , most of whom served in the @entity238			0
the most celebrated was @entity187 , with 309 confirmed kills			0
killing did not come easily to her			0
‘ i knew my task was to kill human beings , ’ she said			0
‘ in theory , that was fine , but i knew the real thing would be completely different			0
’ as with many snipers , she appeared to hesitate before her first kill			0
however , after witnessing the death of a comrade , she soon grew hardened — and ‘ after that nothing could stop me ’			0
those such as @entity187 , @entity24 and @entity222 were lucky to have survived			0
on the @entity10 , the average sniper managed to fire his rifle no more than 15 to 20 times before being killed			0
snipers are much less likely to die in today ’s wars			0
thanks to the astonishing range of their rifles , they can be more than a mile from their target and still have a chance of making a kill			0
with state - of - the art weaponry like the @entity89 - made @entity267 rifle which can kill from well over a mile , snipers are much less likely to die in today 's wars @entity270 front line sniper holding his armour piercing @entity274 .338 - calibre sniper rifle the longest sniper kill on record was made by a @entity89 corporal in the @entity278 and @entity279 called @entity280 , who in november 2009 killed two @entity92 machine gunners at a range of just over one - and - a - half miles ( 2,475m )			1
to make a kill at such a range requires more than just a steady hand and a good eye			0
modern snipers can be equipped with laser rangefinders , instruments that measure wind direction and speed , and even computers known as ‘ ballistic support devices ’ that can help the sniper work out where to aim			0
of course , as many snipers would tell you , some kills also require luck			0
@entity280 acknowledges that the weather conditions were near perfect for his long - range shot , with little or no wind and a lack of haze			1
despite their transformation from hate figures to heroes , sniping remains a tough role for any soldier			0
through their sights , snipers can see all too clearly the gory results of their work			0
on occasion , some kills , though necessary , make them feel very uncomfortable			0
the late @entity318 sniper @entity317 , who found himself looking down the sights at a woman combatant carrying a grenade during his first tour in @entity323 in late march 2003 , @entity317 , a @entity318 sniper , found himself in @entity324 in @entity323 about to make his first sniper kill			0
looking through the sights , he saw that his target was a woman carrying a hand grenade			0
just like @entity24 six decades before , @entity317 paused			0
he had never killed a woman before			0
‘ take a shot ! ’ his platoon chief hissed			1
@entity317 squeezed the trigger on his .300 @entity335 rifle and the woman dropped to the ground before she could throw the grenade			0
‘ it was my duty to shoot and i do n’t regret it , ’ @entity317 later recalled			0
‘ my shots saved several @entity140 , whose lives were clearly worth more than that woman ’s twisted soul			0
’ but , like all snipers , for @entity317 killing became chillingly routine			0
‘ after the first kill , the others come easy , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t have to psych myself up or do anything special mentally			0
