by @entity0 published : 09:14 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 09:58 est , 12 june 2012 every ant species known to mankind will soon be chronicled in high - definition 3d			2
a team of @entity5 scientists is on a mission to visit museums around the world and catalogue detailed images of every ant in their collections			1
the study , which is being led by dr @entity13 from the @entity14 , is the first time that researchers have photographed the insects in such fine detail			0
@entity19 : a team of @entity5 scientists is on a mission to visit museums around the world and catalogue detailed images of every ant in their collections extreme close - up : the study is the first time that researchers have photographed the insects in such fine detail their new microscopic imaging technique provides scientists with a hitherto unglimpsed look into ants ' anatomy			1
on their ' world ant tour ' , the scientists will add their findings to a database called @entity37 , a detailed resource that , it is hoped , will prove invaluable to insect researchers			1
dr @entity13 told the @entity41 : ' our goal is to image 10,000 a year			0
' the researchers have so far photographed 8,000 ant species from collections at museums in the @entity5 and are aiming to image up to 30,000			1
they are currently visiting the @entity50 in @entity51 to chronicle the more than 6,000 species held in its vaults			2
at each stop , the team images several specimens of each species , so that the database is as complete as possible			1
this involves photographing different sexes and ant castes - queens , soldiers and workers			0
@entity65 brevicornis : the new microscopic imaging technique provides scientists with a hitherto unglimpsed look into ants ' anatomy on their ' world ant tour ' , the scientists will add their findings to a database called @entity37 , a detailed resource that , it is hoped , will prove invaluable to insect researchers each preserved ant is subjected to dozens of highly - magnified photos at different levels of focus			1
this data is then fed into a computer and a 3d image is built , one that allows scientists to explore each ant 's anatomy in never - before - seen detail dr @entity13 told the @entity41 : ' you can zoom in and see fine hairs , the eyes , all of this detail			2
and all of this , under a microscope , is not in focus			0
' so this is actually the first time , as a scientist , i get to see this ant in @entity102			0
' the @entity37 imaging archive will not just be available to scientists			2
as dr @entity13 explains , ' anyone , anywhere and at any time ' can log in and sample the research			0
main man : the study is being led by dr @entity13 from the @entity14 database : each preserved ant is subjected to dozens of highly - magnified photos at different levels of focus			0

@entity5 scientists will add their detailed images to huge database called @entity37
they have so far imaged 8,000 species and aim to capture up to 30,000
