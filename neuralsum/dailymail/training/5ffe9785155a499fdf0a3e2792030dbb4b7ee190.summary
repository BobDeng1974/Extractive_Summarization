@entity0 : former polygamist @entity1 is unhappy with the new ruling that decriminalizes the practice in @entity4 a former sister wife has spoken out against the polygamous lifestyle , following a new federal ruling that decriminalizes the practice in @entity4			1
@entity1 moved to @entity4 from @entity8 after converting to a fundamentalist @entity10 faith , and says she was part of a plural marriage for 18 years ' the only way that i can explain it is like living with adultery on a daily basis , and having the woman come home , ' @entity1 said			1
' on top of that you have to smile and pretend that everything 's okay because that 's part of the culture too			2
' the practice of polygamy has long been illegal in the @entity28 , and especially persecuted in the state of @entity4 ever since the @entity10 church decided to get rid of @entity32 's principal of plural marriage to become more mainstream			1
but fundamentalist @entity35 have continued the practice , with an estimated 40,000 @entity4 residents currently living in plural marriages			1
most of these families are n't polygamists in law , getting around the anti-polygamy statutes by legally marrying just one of their wives			2
in the past , the powerful @entity10 church has worked through the state to shut down even these technically legal unions , forcibly breaking up the families using a law against cohabitation			2
in a big win for the polygamists , a federal judge struck down that cohabitation rule in december , saying it violated the constitutional right to freedom of religion			1
the ruling comes as bad news for @entity1 and other anti-polygamists who believe the marriages are inherently unequal , and often are n't entered into freely			2
' certainly within @entity10 - based polygamy , it 's not really much of a choice , because @entity10 scriptures teach a woman that if she does n't consent to living in polygamy , @entity67 's going to destroy her , ' @entity1 explained			1
' so for me going into it , i did n't personally want to live it , but i felt compelled to as a matter of faith			0
' but polygamist families like the @entity75 , who live just outside @entity77 , are excited they can now practice their lifestyle without the threat of arrest			1
out in the open : @entity82 ( second right ) sits with his three wives ( from left to right ) @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity82 at their home in @entity77 , @entity4			2
the family has been public about their lifestyle since 2011 the @entity89 have lived openly as a polygamist family ever since publishing a book about their lifestyle in 2011			1
for a long time after that , family patriarch @entity82 says he worried he might be arrested under the anti-polygamy laws in the state			0
' the fear when i went public four years ago , that fear was very real , ' he said			0
their brood : there are 25 children in the @entity82 family , and 17 of the kids still live at home ' this is a third degree felony ... this is serious prison time			0
my grandfathers were imprisoned , so that was a real impact that we felt			0
' @entity82 has three wives , with a total of 25 children - 17 of which still live at home			0
he married cousins @entity84 and @entity82 in 1990 , and ten years later married @entity82 's twin sister @entity85 when her first plural marriage broke down			1
she brought five children with her from that relationship			0
twins : two of @entity89 ' wives are twin sisters			0
he initially married cousins @entity84 and @entity82 in 1990 , and married @entity82 's twin sister @entity85 ten years later @entity82 , who herself works as a lawyer on cases involving polygamy , says the ruling was a relief			1
' that 's been one of the great things about the ruling -- the decriminalization , and the judge saying basically that the state needs to stay out of people â€™s bedrooms , ' she said			2
bad name : fundamentalist mormon leader @entity140 represents the dark side of polygamy			0
he is currently serving a life sentence for sexual assault , including crimes against children ' as long as it 's adults freely choosing what they want , then i do n't feel it would be my place to tell somebody else you ca n't choose to love who you love			0
' while the practice may work for the @entity75 , a 2011 @entity157 study found polygamy causes greater levels of crime , violence , poverty and gender inequality in communities that practice it			0
the @entity167 has called for a ban , while polygamy has been at the center of notorious cases such as that of @entity140 , the @entity10 leader sentenced to life in prison for child sexual assault in 2011			0
the main branch of the @entity10 faith -- the @entity175 -- renounced the practice of polygamy in the 1890s under pressure from the @entity28 government			0
while some offshoots of the religion continue the practice , exact numbers are hard to come by			0
some estimates say that around 40,000 @entity4 residents live in plural marriages			1
@entity4 's attorney general @entity188 has yet to say whether he will challenge the federal court ruling on polygamy			1
the state is also currently fighting to enforce a ban on gay marriage , which was ruled illegal in december by another federal judge .			1

in december , a federal judge ruled @entity4 's law against cohabitation was a violation of the @entity200 right to freedom of religion
@entity1 was a polygamist sister wife for 18 years and says it 's not a choice for many women in the fundamentalist sects
but the *decision* comes as a big win for the estimated 40,000 @entity4 polygamists who can now live their lifestyle more openly
