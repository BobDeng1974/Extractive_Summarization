by @entity0 @entity1 has n’t been a good place for sharks and whales to visit recently , with the state government trialling their controversial shark cull program			0
but one baby humpback was lucky to have encountered a group of fishermen from @entity10 when it was caught in cray pot lines near @entity12 , off @entity1 ’s western coast			1
it took serious guts for one of the boat ’s crew members to swim out and free the baby whale , which looks more like a large shark			2
once the ship ’s skipper swam away from the boat towards the struggling whale and attempted to liberate it , the baby humpback remained near the man and appeared to be slightly more relaxed			1
with the men on the boat cheering him on , the skipper attempted to cut the baby humpback free from the net			1
he struggled to release the whale , despite the suggestions from the men still on the boat			0
distressed : the baby whale can be seen struggling to release itself from the cray pot line what a good bloke : a charter boat 's skipper swims out to free the struggling baby humpback keep calm : the baby humpback appears to be less agitated as the fisherman swims closer so he can free it from the cray pot line ' cut it closer , ’ the man holding the camera directed			1
' do n't try and get it off , mate , just cut the line			0
’ the boat ’s skipper attempted to cut the whale free from the rope with a knife , leaving some of the rope remaining – so as not to distress it by getting too close and allowing it to swim free			2
eventually , the whale swims free and the men on the boat congratulate the man who did the hard work of actually releasing the baby humpback			1
' that 's it , go free baby ! ' the man holding the camera cheers			2
' well done little fella , ’ he then said			0
@entity78 : the whale is able to swim free , after being cut from the cray pot line making a speedy getaway : the baby humpback swims free , as the fisherman swims back to the boat proud as punch : the boat 's skipper is unable to hide his excitement , following his encounter with the baby humpback speaking with @entity10 ’s 3 news , the skipper ’s father says his son would n’t have had a second thought about jumping into the water to rescue the struggling baby whale			1
‘ if he 'd thought about it , he would n’t have done it			0
the whale was in the shit , so he jumped in and did it , ’ @entity97 said			0
mr @entity97 also added that his son , who has been working as a skipper for around six years , said releasing the whale was a wonderful feeling .			0
