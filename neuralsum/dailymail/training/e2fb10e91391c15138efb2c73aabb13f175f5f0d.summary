by @entity0 published : 03:11 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 08:38 est , 19 september 2012 a university team has uncovered a massive @entity3 mosaic in southern @entity4 - a meticulously crafted , 1,600 - square - foot work of decorative handiwork on the fringes of the @entity3			1
while @entity4 was under the @entity3 for a time , it was pushed back by the @entity9 - making this find a demonstration of the surprising reach and cultural influence of the @entity3 in the area during the third and fourth centuries @entity15			1
since 2005 , @entity16 , professor of art history at @entity18 – @entity19 , and a 60 - strong team have been excavating the remains of the ancient city of @entity23 on the southern @entity4 coast			1
' we were surprised to have found a mosaic of such size and of such caliber in this region – it 's an area that had usually been off the radar screens of most ancient historians and archaeologists , and suddenly this mosaic comes into view and causes us to change our focus about what we think ( the region ) was like in antiquity			0
' @entity49 of @entity50 , a patron king of @entity51 , founded the city in the middle of the first century			0
@entity16 said : ' this region is not well understood in terms of history and archeology			1
' it 's not a place in which archaeologists have spent a lot of time , so everything we find adds more evidence to our understanding of this area of the @entity3			2
' we 're beginning to understand now that it was more @entity69 , more in line than the rest of the @entity3 world than was suspected before			1
' [ the nature of the mosaic ] hammers home how @entity3 this city truly is			2
' @entity77 remains : the mosaics and ancient structures imply the area was once a bustling city how @entity82 was won : the @entity3 - at the height of its reign - covered most of what we now know as @entity82 , as well as the north of @entity87 @entity23 had many of the trappings expected of a @entity3 provincial city – temples , baths , markets and colonnaded streets , said @entity16			1
the city thrived during the empire from an economy focused on agricultural products , especially wine and lumber			0
excavation has focused on a third - century imperial temple , and also a colonnaded street lined with shops			0
in july , the team began to explore the mosaic , which was part of a @entity3 bath			1
the decoration consists of large squares , each filled with different colored geometric designs and ornamentation			0
@entity3 ( @entity113 ) @entity114 ( @entity115 ) @entity116 ( @entity117 ) @entity118 ( @entity119 ) @entity120 ( @entity121 ) @entity122 ( @entity123 ) @entity124 : the @entity3 begins , spreading out as just a tiny dot from @entity51 to encompass @entity126			2
at this time , @entity4 ( outlined ) was in the hands of the barbarians and the @entity9 100 - 200 ad : at the height of the @entity3 , the @entity3 encompassed 2.2million square miles 300 - 400ad : but as @entity51 expanded beyond a manageable size , the barbarians pushed back ' this would have been a very formal associated pavement attached to the bath , ' @entity16 said			1
' this is a gorgeous mosaic , and its size is unprecedented ' – so large , in fact , that work crews have uncovered only an estimated 40 percent of its total area			0
@entity16 said it appears the mosaic served as a forecourt for the adjacent large bath , and that at least on one side , evidence shows there was a roof covering the geometric squares that would have been supported by piers			2
those piers ' remains are preserved , he said			0
meanwhile , the middle of the mosaic was outfitted with a marble - lined , 25 - foot - long pool , which would have been uncovered and open to the sun. a corner of a @entity3 bath discovered during the summer still intact : the mosaic was buried for centuries , before excavations began in 2005 the other half of the mosaic , adjacent to the bath , has yet to be revealed but is expected to contain the same type of decoration , @entity16 said			1
crews expect to unearth the entire work next summer			0
team members first noticed the mosaic in 2001 when a large archaeological survey project that included @entity16 noticed plowing by a local farmer had brought up pieces of a mosaic in a field next to a still - standing bath structure			1
the find was brought to the attention of the archeological museum in @entity179 , who two years later made a minor investigation that revealed a small portion of the mosaic			0
last year , the museum invited @entity16 to clear the mosaic and to preserve it for tourists and scholars			2
@entity16 's 60 - person team also included @entity187 can , assistant professor of archaeology at @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity4 , a sister university to the @entity18 as well as more than 30 students			1
@entity16 said the significance of this summer 's discovery has him eager to return to the site and see what the rest of the excavation uncovers			2
' as an archaeologist , i am always excited to make new discoveries			0
the fact that this discovery is so large and also not completely uncovered makes it doubly exciting , ' he said			0
' i am already looking forward to next year , though i just returned from @entity4			0

@entity208 measures 1,600sq ft and was once part of *lavish* @entity3 bath in southern @entity4
professor of art - history @entity16 : ' it was more @entity69 than was suspected before '
