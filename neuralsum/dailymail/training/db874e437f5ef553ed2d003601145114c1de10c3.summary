by @entity1 reporter published : 08:32 est , 12 august 2012 updated : 04:57 est , 13 august 2012 as they took their first steps together on the campaign trail today , it was revealed that @entity7 's path to becoming @entity10 's @entity9 vice-presidential running mate was steeped in secrecy , from an incognito trip to meet @entity10 to a furtive walk through the woods at his boyhood @entity16 home			1
the head of @entity10 's vp search process , longtime confidante @entity17 , broke her silence on many details in a briefing with reporters inside a hangar at @entity25 near @entity26			1
@entity10 and @entity7 themselves spoke to reporters briefly on their flight to @entity30			1
almost a week ago , @entity7 snuck through @entity32 's @entity31 in a baseball cap and sunglasses and flew to @entity35			2
@entity37 's 19 - year - old son picked up @entity7 and drove him to a private meeting in his parents ' dining room where the deal was sealed			2
by night , he was eating @entity62 's takeout at a nondescript chain hotel in that state and preparing for his big debut speech , according to @entity17			0
the search for @entity19 was so confidential that background information on a short list of candidates , including several years of tax returns and other documents , were kept in a safe in a locked room at @entity10 's campaign headquarters and the few people allowed in were not permitted to make copies or take anything out			1
what began in april as a long list of candidates was winnowed down to a short list by may 1			1
by early july , the serious candidates had emerged			0
@entity10 knew @entity7 was his man before @entity7 knew			1
after extensive deliberations over his short list , @entity10 settled on the 42 - year - old @entity16 congressman who has built a conservative record as a budget hawk in @entity26			1
@entity10 made up his mind on august 1 , the day after he returned from a week - long trip to @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
campaign trail : the @entity9 hopefuls stand with their wives @entity95 ( second left ) and @entity96 ( far right ) as they announced the vp nominee today happy : @entity9 vice presidential candidate @entity7 ( @entity99 ) campaigns with @entity9 presidential candidate @entity10 on august 11 , 2012 in @entity100 , @entity55 a face - to - face meeting was required , and therein lies a tale			1
the meeting was arranged for august 5 at @entity17 ' home in @entity105 , @entity49			1
the challenge was to get both @entity7 and @entity10 together in the same room without the news media or anyone else outside the inner circle knowing about it			1
@entity17 ' home was chosen for the assignation			0
@entity10 had little problem eluding the news media camped out near his vacation home on @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118			1
it was getting @entity7 there that was the challenge			2
to avoid flying out of a @entity16 airport where he could be easily recognized , he was driven to @entity32 's o'hare airport for a flight to @entity127 's @entity126 airport in @entity128			0
' we gave a lot of thought on how to make this work undetected , ' @entity17 said			0
' and we sent my 19 - year - old son , @entity133 , to pick him up			0
' @entity7 was wearing jeans , a casual shirt , baseball hat and sunglasses and passed unnoticed through both airports			2
' family : @entity9 vice presidential candidate @entity7 ( @entity99 ) , second from left , with his wife @entity95 , and @entity9 presidential candidate , @entity10 , with his wife @entity144 , wave to supporters on august 11 , 2012 in @entity100 , @entity55 @entity10 and @entity7 met privately more than an hour in @entity17 ' dining room after lunch			1
' we talked about the campaign , how it would be run , ' @entity10 said			2
' we talked about how we 'd work together if we get to the @entity151 , what the relationship would be , how we would interact and be involved in important decisions			0
' @entity7 said being chosen was like going ' from the surreal to the real , i guess			2
' ' by the time we met in person i kinda knew it was going to happen			0
and i was very humbled			0
it was the biggest honor i 've ever been given in my life , ' he said			0
then came the problem of getting @entity7 to @entity164 for the rollout announcement without the news media sleuthing it out			1
such movements have been detected before			0
they wanted to do the announcement on friday in @entity118 but @entity7 needed to attend a memorial service in @entity172 , @entity16 , for victims of a mass shooting at a @entity176 temple			2
close : @entity9 presidential candidate , former @entity49 gov. @entity10 talks to senior adviser @entity17 after they boarded his charter plane in @entity180 , @entity181 , thursday , aug. 2 , 2012 , en route to @entity183 , @entity181 after that ceremony , @entity7 was driven to his home in @entity186 , @entity16 , by aide @entity187			1
he walked in the front door , through the house and out the back door , into a patch of woods familiar from his youth			0
on the other side was the house where he grew up			0
' i know those woods like the back of my hand , so it was n't too hard to walk through them , ' @entity7 said			2
' so i just went out my back door and went through the gully in the woods i grew up playing in			0
i walked by the tree that has the old tree fort that i built			0
' when he came out into the open , @entity187 was there to pick him up			0
@entity7 flew from @entity209 to @entity210 , @entity30 , which is not far from @entity164			2
he and his family and @entity17 and a @entity10 group stayed at a @entity213 , ordered in food from @entity62 's and went over @entity7 's introductory speech			1
' it 's now two on two instead of two on one , ' said @entity10			0

selection process so secretive that short list was kept in locked safe at @entity222
