savings : the chancellor , @entity1 is expected to outline a further £ 10bn of welfare savings in the autumn statement on december 5 hidden public service cuts will drain @entity8 's poorest families of 30 per cent of their annual income by 2017 , as the coalition 's tough spending targets begin to bite , new @entity5 research reveals			1
it said reductions in benefits and family tax credits , combined with continuing cuts to welfare , will ' cause considerable financial harm for millions of families '			1
the dire predictions come as chancellor @entity1 prepares to deliver his autumn statement on december 5 , in which he is expected to detail a further £ 10bn of welfare savings over the next five years			1
' unless @entity1 changes course , ' the @entity5 warned			0
' these cuts will be dwarfed by massive reductions in public services			0
' their figures revealed that by 2016 - 17 , the cumulative cost of lost public services for the poorest ten per cent of household will be £ 3,995 in cash terms - or 31.7 per cent of their average annual income			2
by contrast , the top tenth of the income scale will lose just £ 2,805 - or 2.5 per cent of annual income			0
this is because higher earners may use public transport less frequently , opt out of public schooling or healthcare , and less likely to rely on @entity46 centres			0
the analysis also said that the average household had already lost more than £ 1,200 in public services but the real pain is still to come - this is just a third of the cuts they are likely to experience by 2014 - 2015			0
the @entity5 report coincided with a study by the @entity55 which found that 6.1m people in working households live in poverty and more than 5.1m people live in working age households where no one has a job			1
@entity63 , the foundation 's chief executive , told @entity65 : ' the most distinctive characteristic of poverty today is the very high number of working people who are also poor			2
' against the cuts : protesters take part in a @entity5 march against the welfare cuts			1
research by the @entity76 suggests that the poorest families could lose 30 per cent of their income as public services are withdrawn @entity80 , policy director at @entity81 , said on the scaling back back of children 's services : ' demand has increased , but funding reduced , and that has led to the withdrawal of some services and the rationing of others			1
' local authorities have to focus on their statutory responsibilities and other things get neglected			0
' @entity95 , chief executive of the @entity96 , added : ' we are hearing reports from welfare rights advisers up and down the country that the services they provide are being cut or closed down			0
' so a perfect storm is brewing : benefit cuts , service cuts and large - scale welfare reform			2

public service cuts will drain @entity8 's poorest families of 30 per cent of their income , @entity5 say
reductions in benefits and family credit , plus welfare cuts will ' cause considerable financial harm '
