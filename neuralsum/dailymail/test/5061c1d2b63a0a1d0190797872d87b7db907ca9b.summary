killing a spider is one thing but seeing hundreds of babies explode from its body afterwards would freak out anyone			0
this was the case in @entity8 , @entity9 , when a man smacked a huge wolf spider as it scuttled across his kitchen floor			1
he got the shock of his life when he squashed the hairy beast with a broom , only to see hundreds of baby spiders came crawling out of the mother and spreading out in all directions on the floor			2
a female wolf spider scuttles across a kitchen floor in @entity8 , @entity9 the house owner is not too happy and promptly gets out a broom to get rid of the hairy beast ‘ ohhh look at the babies come out of it , ’ the man says in surprise			1
the scene was greeted by the voice of a woman in the background saying : ‘ ahhhhh , kill it ! ! ’ a few more whacks later , and the tiny babies were running everywhere on the floor			0
but to his surprise after smashing the female spider a few times with the broom hundreds of babies appear after giving the spider some more whacks for good measure , the man was heard saying : ‘ it ’s dead			1
’ finally the broom was used for what it was made for - sweeping up what was left on the floor			0
the @entity56 @entity55 website explains that after mating , the female wolf spider produces a silk mat into which she deposits around 100 eggs			2
soon the tiny baby spiders are trying to make a run for it all over the kitchen floor the silk is then rolled into a protective ball which she attaches to her abdomen and proceeds to carry it around with her until the eggs hatch			0
after hatching , the babies crawl onto the mother 's back and remain there until their fat reserves have been used up and they need to start finding their own food , which may take several months			1
that is unless the female spider is cracked a few times over the head with a broom			0
with the spider now dead the man sweeps it up as well as the babies that are spread all around			2

a wolf spider races across a kitchen floor in @entity8 , @entity9
*unluckily* for it it 's *spotted* by a man who smashes it with a broom
following a few whacks hundreds of babies burst out of the female spider
after hatching , spider babies crawl onto the mother 's back and stay there
as most of the the spiders are now dead the man sweeps them all up
