by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ six years have now passed since the @entity3 final hosted two @entity5 teams and 10 @entity5 players in the glittering @entity7			2
these days , such an event would feel an outer - world experience , as though an illusion that this nation could ever enjoy such worldly superiority as it did when @entity13 and @entity14 slugged it out on that dramatic night in @entity15			0
@entity5 clubs have had their moments since , @entity14 battling courageously and improbably to win the competition in 2012 , but recent years have been exercises in containment , rigidity , ill - discipline and usually , hard - luck stories			2
three @entity5 semi-finalists in three consecutive seasons between 2006 and 2009 , playing a confident and dominant brand of football now feels a lifetime away			0
it is as though @entity5 teams no longer feel comfortable in their own skin , reverting only to stifling tactics on the showpiece occasion			0
now , finally challenged to rediscover an attacking verve , the @entity28 team went gung - ho , liberating the restraint that has strangled the national culture in recent years			2
history : six years have passed since two @entity5 team battled it out for the @entity3 in 2008 failed : @entity62 ( left ) and @entity24 were unable to lead the @entity28 into the @entity26 last 16 sidelines : 11 players in the @entity28 squad to played in the @entity3 last season but five have n't kicked a ball in @entity68 it may explain the giddinness and faltering concentration that engulfed @entity62 's side following equalisers in both matches , almost as though many of these players were on work experience before the main event in two years			1
it is a very sad time for @entity5 football when a @entity26 in @entity68 - a once in a life - time opportunity for many of us , we would presume - is tossed away so liberally			2
@entity28 should have done more			0
@entity35 had been beaten by @entity84 , @entity85 and even those whipping boys @entity87 in the past couple of years			0
@entity89 went into this @entity26 on the back of draws with @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0
the debate will rage over whether @entity28 underperformed or whether this is simply an @entity28 team that does not possess the requisite pedigree for the world stage			0
it may well be a bit of both			0
consider this for a moment : just four of the players that started the match against @entity35 have started a @entity3 match in the last two seasons			1
the @entity107 is a fine breeding ground but it simply does not provide that very same brutal induction into the unforgiving and ruthless nature of football at the highest level			0
@entity28 conceded goals from a corner and a goal - kick at this @entity26 , the final blow from @entity117 a goal transplanted from the @entity120 scrapbook for its amateurish , child - like simplicity			2
learning curve : the likes of @entity124 and @entity125 have just 10 @entity28 caps between them experience : all 11 of @entity130 's starting line - up against @entity131 were in the @entity3 last season dip : could the @entity28 be suffering from @entity5 team 's poor performances in @entity136 ? look elsewhere at this @entity26 and it becomes clear that major @entity138 experience is needed			1
taking into account the most recent starting xis selected , @entity28 possess less players from last season 's @entity3 than @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity68 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity89 , @entity147 and @entity130			1
on saturday , @entity147 started with eight , @entity130 with all eleven			0
of course , there are no guarantees			0
@entity87 's entire squad of 23 participated in last season 's @entity3 and they are on the first plane home			1
then again , they can take comfort in two @entity154 and a @entity26 in the last six years			0
@entity156 's exciting @entity143 squad has just nine @entity3 players in their 23 - man squad but in @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , they arguably have the form players in the world at this moment			1
@entity28 's finest never threatened to reach such a level			1
mistake ? @entity14 duo @entity166 ( left ) and @entity167 have years of @entity3 experience but the latter was n't even selected by @entity62 ever - present : @entity14 have been the only @entity5 team to perform in the @entity3 and won the competition in 2012 even amongst those who have dined on the continent 's top table in recent times , question marks remain			1
of the starters against @entity35 , @entity176 is @entity28 's best but he has scored just three @entity3 goals in the last two seasons and has not inscribed his name into a knockout match since @entity13 2011 final defeat by @entity183			1
@entity184 has his qualities but he will never decide a football match alone			2
@entity33 is not the same player without @entity188 beside him			0
@entity32 's @entity189 have barely been exposed to the knockout - stages of the @entity138 competition			1
not good enough : @entity13 were knocked out of the @entity3 by @entity43 stalwarts : @entity40 have qualified for the @entity3 for the 17th consecutive year but the @entity193 are yet to win the trophy so maybe there should be little surprise that for all @entity28 's flirtation with attacking aspiration - and that is all it was , a shimmy across the dance floor , an awkward chat - up line and then the abrupt put - down - @entity28 rarely appeared at ease at this @entity26 , rarely in control of their own fate			1
once again , @entity28 gave notice that they fear , rather than relish , such a stellar stage , frightened to seize the occasion in the way that the @entity212 , ghanians and @entity214 's have done			2
the hazard signs have been flashing for some time now , the @entity138 malaise now reflected in a national team that is shorn of quality , devoid of self - belief and happy to do little more than hop along for the ride			0
the manager and players will bristle at the suggestion but the noises from the @entity227 - @entity226 suggesting that mere qualification for the @entity26 constitutes success , @entity230 irritatingly backing @entity62 on the day @entity28 exited the competition - only contributes to the feeling that @entity5 football increasingly appears to be apathetic , out of ideas , and suffering yet another crisis of confidence			1
pedigree : 65.2 % of the @entity68 @entity26 squad took part in @entity136 's biggest competition last season regular : eight of @entity147 's starting 11 against @entity243 could draw from @entity3 football in 2013/14 exception : all 23 players in the @entity87 squad played @entity3 football last season , but that did n't stop @entity87 from crashing out of the @entity26 goodbye : @entity250 ( left ) and @entity251 stand dejected at @entity87 are knocked out of the @entity26			1

only four players in @entity28 's starting line - up against @entity35 took part in @entity3 football last season
@entity176 , @entity33 , @entity184 and @entity32 were the only players to play in @entity136 's biggest competition
11 players in @entity28 squad played in the @entity3 last season - five have n't kicked a ball in @entity68
82.6 per cent of @entity130 's squad enjoyed @entity3 football during the 2013/14 season
