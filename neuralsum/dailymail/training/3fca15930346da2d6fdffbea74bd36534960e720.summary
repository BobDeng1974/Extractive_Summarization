@entity1 winger @entity0 has revealed that a move to @entity3 in 2007 kick - started his football career and diverted his path away from becoming a carpenter			1
the @entity8 international was not always plying his trade in the @entity11 , instead working his way up the leagues from humble beginnings at @entity15			2
in fact , he was close to giving up before being offered the chance to play abroad ; a move that saved his career			1
@entity0 is now a regular in the @entity11 with @entity1 , but it was n't always like that the pacey winger ( right ) started out in @entity23 with @entity15 , before moving to @entity3 @entity0 takes on @entity24 during @entity8 's @entity25 semi-final clash in early february ' simply playing professional football is a dream come true , but if i had n't made it as a player , i would 've probably gone into carpentry , ' @entity0 wrote on his blog for @entity34			1
' this is what i was set up to do , before i went to play football in @entity3			2
' my girlfriend 's dad and i were planning on working together , but i got the move to @entity41 and the rest is history			2
i am pretty handy , though , and would 've learned a lot more			0
' @entity45 , perhaps , is one word to describe @entity0 's talents on the pitch too ... although that would be understating his ability			0
