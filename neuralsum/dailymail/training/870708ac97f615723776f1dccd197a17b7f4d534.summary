@entity0 face a daunting trip to the @entity2 to face @entity4 winners @entity5 on wednesday night in their opening @entity8 encounter			1
the two sides have been drawn in the same group together for the third time in four seasons , meaning this is their fifth encounter since september 2011			1
here , @entity15 looks at how the two side 's likely starting line - ups compare ... @entity5 @entity18 - 9 the sweeper keeper is the best in the world			1
he takes strong command of his area and it usually takes something special to beat him			0
@entity26 @entity25 - winning goalkeeper @entity18 will hope to keep a clean sheet against @entity0 @entity28 - 7.5 @entity29 has recovered from being elbowed in the face by @entity31 on international duty			2
@entity28 is likely to form part of a @entity5 back three against @entity0 at the @entity2 @entity35 - 8 @entity37 defender who rarely misplaces a pass			1
vastly improved from the player he was at the @entity41			0
@entity35 ( left ) will face former side @entity0 when he lines up for @entity5 on wednesday @entity42 - 6.5 the bulky @entity44 defender can lose concentration easily			1
could be a weak link for @entity0 to exploit			0
@entity42 ( centre ) will be at the heart of @entity5 's defence as they look to beat @entity0 in the @entity8 @entity51 - 8.5 a consistent performer , steady passer and solid defender			1
@entity51 will captain @entity5 from the heart of midfield against @entity0 on wednesday @entity58 - 7.5 will try to dictate the pace of the game			1
in the absence of @entity62 will be an important player in midfield			0
@entity58 has thrived in midfield for new side @entity5 since his summer switch from @entity67 @entity68 - 7.5 scored the winning goal in the @entity25 final and netted in @entity5 ’s 2 - 0 @entity4 win over @entity72 last week			2
@entity68 ( centre ) scored the winning goal in the @entity25 final and will be a threat to the @entity0 defence @entity76 - 7 @entity5 new boy is a @entity78 under - 21 international signed from @entity79			1
highly rated for his tackling and danger he poses to opposition defence			0
@entity83 ( left ) will form part of an attacking trio for @entity5 against @entity0 on wednesday @entity86 - 7.5 the 5ft 6in midfielder was a transfer target for @entity89			1
his speed can be difficult to deal with			0
@entity86 scored a hat - trick at the @entity25 and will aim to break down the @entity0 defence @entity93 - 8.5 this unorthodox striker sometimes appears bumbling but he works hard , has great awareness and scores plenty of goals			2
@entity93 scores important goals for club and country and will work his heart out for @entity5 @entity102 - 8.5 @entity104 front man has yet to find his feet at @entity5 since joining from @entity106 in the summer but he thrives on the big occasions			2
@entity108 - 7.8 @entity102 was @entity110 's big summer signing and he is a predator in front of opposition goal @entity115 's @entity114 time is now - @entity110 @entity0 @entity116 - 7.5 commands respects from teammates but can get himself in sticky situations			1
was beaten at his near post by @entity123 in @entity5 ’s 3 - 1 victory at the @entity41 last season			2
@entity116 was dropped after struggling against @entity5 last season so it is a huge match for the @entity0 stopper @entity129 - 7 a capable deputy for @entity131 but perhaps does not possess the same blood - and - guts determination as the fearsome @entity133			2
@entity129 ( left ) will make his @entity8 debut for @entity0 at the @entity135 against @entity5 @entity136 - 8 the captain is a fearless and steely presence in defence			1
important because of the discipline he instils on the pitch			0
@entity136 , @entity0 's captain , will be key to his side 's chances at the heart of their defence @entity147 - 7 has improved concentration levels but still prone to the occasional defensive error			1
a useful aerial threat from set pieces as demonstrated against @entity152 last week			0
@entity147 has gone from a laughing stock last season to mr @entity155 at the back for @entity0 @entity157 - 8 has a sweet left foot and has scored two @entity8 goals for @entity0 which bodes well			2
@entity160 will offer an attacking threat from left - back for @entity0 but he can be caught out defensively @entity163 - 8.5 dominates and still very much the focal point of the @entity0 midfield			0
on the brink of signing new contract at the @entity41 according to @entity136			0
@entity163 should return in midfield and his power will be a key asset for @entity0 in the middle of the park @entity174 - 7 can not be faulted for his commitment to the cause			0
works tirelessly and makes crucial tackles			0
@entity174 will once again shield the @entity0 back four from @entity5 's attacking threats @entity181 - 8.5 oozes class on the ball , the midfield magician can fashion a chance out of the most fleeting of opportunities			1
@entity181 is crucial to @entity0 's attacking plans and he will aim to thread balls through for strikers @entity190 - 9 he and @entity181 are the players that will most scare @entity5			1
possesses an exciting burst of speed and capable of getting in behind defenders			0
@entity190 is in fantastic goal - scoring form and he will hope to continue that on wednesday at the @entity135 @entity198 - 7.5 creative and versatile but sometimes shirks defensive responsibilities			0
@entity198 can blow hot and cold but he is on song he is dangerous due to his trickery and guile @entity203 - 7.5 vastly improved under the tutelage of @entity205			0
looks hungry for the ball and is sharp in the box			0
@entity108 - 7.6 @entity203 looks likely to be given the task of leading the line for @entity0 against @entity5 at the @entity2			1
