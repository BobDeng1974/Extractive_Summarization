by @entity0 last updated at 5:05 am on 24th january 2012 it is a country estate of such beauty that it inspired the composition of one of our best loved hymns			2
but the mansion behind ‘ @entity8 ’ was the subject of an unholy row in court today over its modernised interior			1
conservation officials failed in their demand for access to @entity16 to check on renovations and were told by the owner : ‘ an @entity20 's home is his castle			0
’ @entity22 , 56 , told a court how planning inspectors had made up to 20 visits to the country mansion after they feared the @entity28 listed property had been given a ‘ footballer 's wife - style ’ makeover			1
dispute : the ivy - clad @entity16 in the @entity32 near @entity33 , owned by @entity22 , has been at the centre of an argument over renovation work that has taken place inside the @entity28 listed property inspirational : the fittings inside the @entity41 county pile include this ornamental whirlpool but he refused their request for an architectural historian to inspect the @entity48 manor which is nestled in the idyllic @entity32 in @entity41 , and @entity49 took him to court			1
previous close inspection of the house was carried out by @entity54 composer @entity53 in 1848 , who was so impressed by the surroundings that she wrote one of her most famous and popular pieces			0
the ‘ purple - headed mountain ’ in one verse of the hymn is thought to refer to the nearby @entity59 and @entity61 peaks , while ‘ the river running by ’ in the next line is the @entity67 which winds along the valley floor close to the estate ’s boundary			1
the home is currently for sale at £ 2.25million but work carried out mr @entity22 has come in for close scrutiny			1
@entity76 planning officer @entity75 told the hearing she had visited the property at least 10 times and wanted to carry out further checks			2
she said : ‘ the authority has now engaged a conservation expert who needs to advise us about the works that have taken place			0
renovation : mr @entity22 has installed a chandelier light in the kitchen of @entity16			1
the dispute arose after he refused to allow an architectural historian to inspect the @entity48 manor to see what changes were being made checks : the court heard that council officials made up to 20 visits to the property to assess the work and eventually took out an injunction to make sure no further building took place ‘ he will advise the authority if the history of the building has been compromised and on remedial work to put the building back to its original state			1
’ mr @entity22 , a builder and car dealer , bought the house for £ 675,000 in 2007 and has since spent more than £ 1million on it			1
he admits that a new kitchen and bathrooms have been installed but claims the work falls outside the restrictions on listed buildings			2
planning officials were called in after it was compared to a ‘ footballer 's wife monstrosity ’ which may have damaged the historic gem and an injunction was taken out to stop further work			2
@entity127 ( @entity128 ) was a poet who also penned at least 400 hymns			0
she was born in @entity131 in 1818 , and spent much of her later life in @entity133 and @entity134 with her husband , @entity135 , who became archbishop of @entity137 and @entity138			0
mrs @entity139 was a keen supporter of the @entity140 , and in 1848 published hymns for little children , which include three of the most popular hymns in the @entity145 language : @entity146 and there is a @entity148			0
the book was published in 69 editions and all the profits were given to @entity54 charities			0
she died in 1895 and is buried in @entity133			0
mr @entity22 told magistrates in @entity33 that he had always complied with the regular inspections by the @entity76 officials			1
but he opposed the application for a warrant to enter the property saying : ‘ enough is enough			1
’ he continued : ‘ i have to take a stand			0
no further work has taken place since their last visit			2
‘ my sister is suffering from cancer and is convalescing at my home at the moment			0
‘ they have been there up to 20 times and i 'm not prepared to let them come again			2
’ dr @entity173 , representing mr @entity22 , told the hearing : ‘ there is no evidence of any new works or that anything extra has happened			1
‘ it seems that the @entity76 are coming back for another bite of a cherry that has already been bitten on many occasions			0
’ the magistrates refused to grant the @entity184 a warrant to enter the property and awarded £ 500 costs to mr @entity22			1
chairman of the bench dr @entity190 told the court : ‘ mr @entity22 has said under oath that no further work has been carried out on the property and on those grounds the application is refused			1
’ after the case , mr @entity22 said : ‘ i have always welcomed the @entity76 people when they have visited my home			1
‘ but it is my home and there has to be a limit to the number of times they want to have a look around			0
‘ i would get a letter one day saying they were coming the next			0
i opposed the warrant because quite simply enough is enough			2
‘ an @entity20 's home is his castle - only in this case it 's a @entity212 's home			0
’ photographs used by the estate agent show the inside of the seven - bedroom house has changed considerably since the time of mrs @entity139 ’s visit			0
the kitchen has a large chandelier and granite tops while the bathroom boasts an ornamental @entity224 bath , and there is nothing mrs @entity139 would recognise about the high - ceilinged cinema room			0
inspiration the ' purple - headed mountains ' and ' river running by ' of the @entity32 are referred to in the hymn @entity8 , penned at @entity16 by @entity54 composer @entity53 the estate agent description states : ‘ much of its character still remains yet the expansive home also embodies great comfort and ease of living			1
’ but the refurbishment work by property developer has not won universal songs of praise			1
before the hearing @entity242 county councillor @entity241 said : ‘ the house is an architectural gem and the park authority has a legal obligation to ensure that listed buildings are preserved			2
mrs @entity139 , who also wrote once in @entity249 , died in 1895 at the age of 77			0
it has been claimed that @entity8 was also inspired by countryside near @entity253 in @entity254 , and the poetry of @entity256			1
the words in turn influenced the works of @entity260 , who used the ‘ all creatures great and small ’ line as the title of his books about the life of a vet in the @entity267 .			0

mansion was inspiration for hymn ' @entity8 '
@entity273 made up to 20 visits to inspect building work
matter went to court when *homeowner* @entity22 refused architectural historian entry to the property
@entity282 refuses to issue council warrant and awards mr @entity22 £ 500 costs
