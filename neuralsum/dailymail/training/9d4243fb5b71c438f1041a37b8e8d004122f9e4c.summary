by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:59 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:00 est , 28 december 2013 up to a million passengers were caught in rail chaos yesterday in what @entity6 bosses said was ‘ the worst disruption in recent memory ’			1
a quarter of all 8,000 trains running in @entity12 were cancelled or seriously delayed as 114mph gales , flooding and landslides threw services into disarray			1
the fiasco is set to trigger compensation payouts to thousands of travellers			2
holidays derailed : thousands of passengers were stuck waiting at @entity23 , pictured , in severe disruption commuter services in the @entity26 and long - distance @entity28 services in the @entity29 were among the worst hit			1
@entity28 said around half of its services on the main @entity35 - @entity34 route from @entity36 to @entity37 were disrupted			2
with up to 28 trains running in each direction from @entity36 to @entity34 , it means thousands of passengers were affected			1
some services to @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 were also hit , but not as badly			1
a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ around 2,000 of the 8,000 services run were seriously delayed or cancelled			1
this is one of the worst disruptions in recent memory but is down to the adverse weather conditions			2
‘ we do apologise and hope passengers will understand			2
’ there was virtually no service at all on some lines			1
chaos : a @entity6 spokesman described the disruption as the worst in recent memory			2
pictured : @entity23 impatient : @entity59 , 19 , from @entity60 , @entity61 , was stranded on her way to @entity42 for the new year no room at the inn : this passenger used his groaning suitcases as a makeshift bench at @entity23 station @entity70 , which covers services from @entity36 to @entity72 and @entity73 , only started running services at midday yesterday but last night it said timetables would be back to normal today			1
@entity76 , managing director of network operations at @entity6 , said : ‘ passengers have had a tough week of travelling and unfortunately that is likely to continue for at least another day			0
’ he added that safety ‘ comes first ’			0
on another day , a cheerful festive greeting from @entity28 may have passed with barely anyone noticing			0
a spokesman tweeted : ‘ we ’re back in the game			0
did everyone have a good @entity87 ? ’ it was followed by : ‘ we ’re planning on running a normal service today			1
’ alas , he spoke too soon as the cheery tweet became the focus of passenger fury when the schedule went off - track			0
as its page was inundated with angry tweets , @entity28 posted more sober messages such as : ‘ new : from 11.45am the line between @entity100 and @entity101 will be blocked for two hours to make repairs			0
’ however , mps said it was not good enough			0
conservative mp for @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity109 , said she had received many gripes about @entity70 and its failure to supply buses to replace the trains			1
‘ i have received a lot of complaints about them , ’ she said			0
‘ they have been just too complacent			1
the fact is that the buses are getting through			0
‘ why have n’t @entity70 made sure that constituents who want to get to @entity121 or to @entity36 can use those buses ? ‘ their point is that it ’s a bit late in the day to try and get bus replacement services in place , but that ’s not good enough			1
’ @entity128 mp @entity127 , a member of the all - party commons transport select committee , said regulators should consider stripping franchises from those rail firms who have failed to deal effectively with the @entity87 floods			1
he said : ‘ these failings sadly confirm what is already known			0
rail companies ’ performance has been extremely patchy and that should be taken into account when the system is re-franchised			2
some of these companies are clearly not capable of running a public service			2
’ however , mr @entity76 insisted @entity6 staff have been doing their best : ‘ this has been one of the most challenging periods we have faced in recent times and our engineers have been doing all they can to get things moving again			0
‘ we ’ve spent 48 hours clearing up the remains of trees , a lot of landslips , mudslides and washouts			0
‘ on top of that we ’ve got our @entity87 weekend engineering work , which kicked in on @entity160			0
so i ’m afraid what passengers are facing today is some disruption anyway because of the engineering work			0
’ chaos : several trains were also delayed out of @entity36 's @entity168 station , pictured			1

trains were delayed as 114mph gales , flooding and landslides hit @entity12
some lines had virtually no service and @entity70 only started at noon
@entity178 mp @entity109 said rail firms ' have been just too complacent '
