she told @entity13 : ‘ one part of your brain is going , ' oh my @entity17 , i 'm so blessed , it 's a miracle ' , and the other half is going , ' i ca n't bear this , i 'm so fat , i 'm ugly , i 've got headaches , i 've got spots , i feel sick			1
the model has revealed he has been gorging on junk food to ease the nausea ' @entity28 's not too happy with me moaning every two seconds ( and ) the perks — the big boobs and that — he ca n't go anywhere near because they 're too painful			1
’ the only pro so far is her change in diet – the 29 year old has been loading up on carbohydrates in an effort to stem her constant nausea , which involves snacking on items including croissants , cream cheese bagels and muffins			0

her younger brother @entity100 , 27 , is a professional footballer for @entity101 , so she was forced to attend matches as a child long before she met @entity1			2
@entity46 admits that she pays little attention to her husband ’s football games and claims she never watches him play on television because the game bores her but her association with the sport has done little to make her like it , in fact , it has had the opposite effect and she admits she actively dislikes football			0
