’ during a two - decade long career in which he has had more than 3,000 guests on his show , @entity0 was proud of what he called his sensitive questioning technique			1
in an interview last october , he said he was particularly keen not to encourage his guests to become too emotional			0
‘ i ’m always uneasy both as a viewer and an interviewer with tears on tv because it is one of the most private reflexes becoming public , ’ he said			0
but some production staff at the @entity62 arts unit that produces @entity10 claim to have seen a very different side to the presenter , labelling him a bully who was capable of reducing women to tears			0
according to one insider , the response by @entity4 management until now was to move any staff who claimed to be unhappy rather than to confront @entity0 , because it did n’t want to risk upsetting one of its stars			1
programme : next week , the new series of his @entity22 show @entity0 ... , which last year featured @entity78 will go ahead as scheduled but with the recent launch of a @entity4 confidential 24 - hour ‘ bullying and harassment ’ telephone line for staff and freelancers , the situation changed			1
