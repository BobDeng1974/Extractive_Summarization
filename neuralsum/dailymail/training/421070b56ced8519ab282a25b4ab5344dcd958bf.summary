by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 12:55 est , 2 december 2013 oh dear - this intruder was caught out when they wandered into a back garden with a tennis court			1
the small roe deer got his antlers snagged in the net and was found frantically trying to get free by the startled householder			2
they called the @entity10 and two inspectors were sent to cut free the stricken beast - nicknamed @entity12 after @entity15 tennis star @entity14 - in @entity16 near @entity17 , @entity18			1
@entity19 - roe : this roe deer got served with a tricky situation after it became trapped in a tennis court net @entity10 inspector @entity24 said : ' this poor boy had a very frightening experience			1
' his antlers were completely entwined in the netting and he was getting frantic trying to free himself			0
' there is no way he would have been able to untangle himself without any help			0
' had the owners of the property not been at home to find him and thought to call us , it is likely that the deer may have suffered an injury or starved to death			0
' luckily , @entity12 escaped with only a minor injury to his leg and was released back into the wild			1
' frustration : but the unlucky animal was rescued by two @entity10 inspectors after the homeowner spotted the stricken beast @entity10 inspector @entity24 said incidents like this , which can be fatal , can be avoided if nets are put away safely after use every year , dozens of deer and other animals are injured and killed after getting caught in man - made netting , with fruit netting being especially deadly to hedgehogs			2
inspector @entity24 added : ' the problem is so easily avoidable by ensuring nets are removed and stored , or taken home after a game of tennis and any discarded netting is safely placed in a bin			0
' i would ask anyone with a net in their garden to please consider the consequences for animals and birds and make frequent checks so that any trapped wildlife may be freed			0

' @entity12 ' did not cover himself in glory on the tennis court
the cute interloper somehow managed to trap himself in the net
luckily , he was rescued by @entity10 *officers* and was soon ' out ' and about
