by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 21 june 2013 @entity1 was driving home after picking up her boyfriend from work , when a routine traffic stop turned particularly uncomfortable			2
@entity1 's headlight was out , which prompted the stop by @entity8 , @entity10 police officer @entity9			1
@entity9 believed that the two were hiding drugs in the car , so he asked @entity1 to exit the vehicle			1
outside of the car , he asked her to lift up her shirt and shake out her bra - not once , but twice - in order to see if she was concealing anything			2
the request did n't reveal any drugs , and a subsequent search of the vehicle did n't produce anything either			0
' when no drugs appeared , @entity9 ' told me that he was taking me to @entity55 jail for driving on a suspended license and that they had an x-ray machine there and they were definitely going to find what i had hidden inside of me , ' @entity1 said			1
@entity1 was driving on an invalid license , which was enough reason to arrest her			0
instead he asked to search the vehicle , and when the couple relented , he searched it anyway			0
another office who showed up as backup considered the search improper			0
@entity9 broke another rule during the stop by leaving the audio off in the dash camera			0
if the audio had been turned on , ' there would be little to no speculation as to what occurred during that traffic stop , ' said state attorney investigator @entity78			0
at the end of the stop , @entity9 told @entity82 ' i 'm done scaring you , and now you can do home , ' she told @entity86			0
after the incident , she filed a complaint and notified the @entity89			1
bold : @entity1 , left , had just returned from picking up her boyfriend from work			0
he was in the car the whole time officer @entity9 searched @entity1 state attorney @entity36 called for an investigation and wrote a critical letter to the @entity96 saying that the search was ' highly questionable ' and not only ' demeaning ' but ' ineffective and possibly dangerous			1
' he cited the fact that , if @entity1 had been concealing a weapon , asking her to shake out her bra would have just given her access to that weapon			1
@entity9 , on the other hand , told investigators that the search method ' is a known technique that is used by some @entity96 officers though he ca n't recall formally being trained to use it			1
' looking back on the incident ( @entity9 ) recognizes that he was overzealous in his attempt to locate illegal drugs or contraband in the car , ' @entity78 said			2
@entity9 was put on a four day suspension with pay during the investigation and returned to work on june 18			2
the @entity96 will now be conducting their own investigation of the incident , in order to determine whether or not to terminate @entity9			1
' this department does not condone the alleged actions as have been reported in recent days and any officer proven to be involved in this type of behavior will be dealt with accordingly , including possible termination , ' lakeland police chief @entity120 said in a statement .			0
