but they now account for 80 per cent of population growth , while the white population remains constant			0

they are seven times more likely to live in an urban area than someone who is white			0
but over time , ethnic minorities will move out of deprived inner city areas and into suburbs and surrounding towns , echoing the way that white groups migrated in the past with the growth of the middle classes , the report predicts			1
