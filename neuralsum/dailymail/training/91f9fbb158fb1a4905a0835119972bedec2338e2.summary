at least 19 people have been killed and 60 others injured after @entity3 militants launched a savage suicide bomb and gun attack on a @entity7 mosque in @entity8			1
the radical @entity10 stormed the mosque in @entity12 - close to the @entity15 border - during friday prayers this afternoon and fired automatic weapons at random , local police said			1
amid the ensuing chaos three suicide bomb blasts were heard inside the mosque , which the @entity3 are understood to have targeted because they think shi'ites are not true @entity21			1
the @entity8 @entity3 , who are fighting to set up a hardline @entity24 theocracy in the country , claimed responsibility for the attack , saying it was revenge for @entity8 's crackdown on militants following a massacre at a school in the city that killed 145 people , including 132 children			1
' either @entity8 will become your graveyard , or @entity56 's law , sharia , will be implemented , ' @entity3 commander @entity52 said in a video in which he was flanked by three young militants clutching @entity61 assault rifles			1
' this is the first in a series of revenge attacks ... wait for the rest , ' @entity52 , who had earlier claimed responsibility for the december 16 school attack in which more than 150 people were killed , said in the video sent by email to reporters			1
the style of the mosque attack was similar to that of the school attack , when gunmen arrived in a car , set it on fire , and broke into the building using a back entrance			2
@entity12 's @entity81 said at least 19 people had been killed in the latest attack			2
devastation : police said armed men broke into the mosque , where people were attending friday prayers , and opened fire , following which three explosions were heard inside the building wounded : a badly injured man is carried out of the building by the building following the attack the head of the provincial police , @entity94 , said four or five attackers entered the mosque from a building next door that was under construction , then jumped over an outer wall into the mosque courtyard			1
one person then blew himself up , creating a diversion so the other attackers could enter the mosque , @entity94 said			0
he said at least three attackers died in the violence - two by blowing themselves up , and a third was killed by worshippers at the mosque			2
' people here showed great courage			0
they grabbed one of the attackers from his neck , and he could n't detonate ( his explosives ) , and he was shot and killed , ' @entity94 added			0
authorities were still examining the scene , and @entity94 did not say what happened to the remaining attacker or attackers			0
some people who fled the mosque reported that at least some of the attackers were wearing security uniforms			0
' the prayer was about to end when a big bang happened , followed by dust and smoke			0
i have seen amid the smoke that one guy dressed in police uniform was firing shots and then there was another blast , ' said one of the wounded , 22 - year - old @entity140 , speaking from his hospital bed			0
locals comfort a local woman after this morning 's savage suicide bomb and gun attack on a @entity7 mosque at least 19 people were killed and 60 others injured after @entity3 militants launched the attack on a @entity7 mosque in the @entity8 city of @entity12 during friday prayers this afternoon the head of the provincial police , @entity94 , said four or five attackers entered the mosque from a building next door that was under construction , then jumped over an outer wall into the mosque courtyard a witness , @entity162 , said that @entity7 worshippers had just finished prayers when five or six men wearing military uniforms broke into the mosque and started shooting			1
' we had no idea what was going on			0
one of the attackers then blew himself up and then there was huge smoke and dust all around , ' he said			0
the attack came as @entity8 tries to adopt new measures to tackle militants following the school massacre , in which 134 children were among the dead			1
the government has pledged to crack down on all militant groups , and has reintroduced the death penalty , set up military courts to speed convictions and widened its offensive in northwestern areas on the @entity15 border where militants find refuge			2
yet @entity8 's religious minorities , among them @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 , say the government is doing little to alleviate their daily struggle against discrimination and violence			2
last month , dozens of people were killed in a similar attack on a @entity7 mosque in the southern town of @entity205 .			0
