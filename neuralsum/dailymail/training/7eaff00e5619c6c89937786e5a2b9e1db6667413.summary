by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor after years of castigating @entity3 for his economic stewardship and his health insurance overhaul , real estate billionaire @entity2 has cut the president some slack			1
seated behind a cluttered desk in his @entity10 building in @entity11 , @entity2 said he could think of one @entity3 administration accomplishment that he found praiseworthy			1
' you could say the only thing would be the execution of the man who knocked down the @entity17 , ' @entity2 told mailonline tuesday , referring to the @entity20 raid that took out terrorist mastermind @entity21 on may 2 , 2011			1
then , with an abrupt head - turn , @entity2 took a deep breath			2
@entity2 praised @entity3 for the @entity21 kill raid -- for a moment -- before shifting all the credit to the @entity1 military @entity21 led @entity28 through the 9/11 attacks in 2001 , but then went into hiding , spurring a years - long intelligence chase that culminated in @entity3 's ' go ' order nearly a decade later spectator : president @entity3 ' happened to be there , and he said , " yes , go get him " , ' @entity2 insisted ' but in all fairness , that was the military that was after him for years , ' he said			1
' the guys that got him did a great job			0
when the @entity20 went in , they did fantastic work			1
@entity3 happened to be there , and he said , " yes , go get him			1
" ' the @entity1 intelligence operations that ultimately located @entity21 in @entity47 , @entity45 began in earnest in 2002 , during the first @entity50 administration , when @entity54 interrogators at the @entity55 , @entity52 detention facility learned a code name used by the terrorist 's most trusted courier			1
through nine years of work , most of them during the @entity50 years , the @entity54 and military intelligence assets worked out the courier 's real name and picked up his trail			0
the location of the @entity28 leader 's @entity45 hideout was first confirmed just one year after @entity3 took office			2
from there an intelligence operation taking more than a year and costing tens of millions of dollars zeroed in on @entity21 , with a @entity54 official and the admiral in charge of the @entity1 @entity73 ( @entity73 ) making a presentation to the president in january 2011			2
@entity3 , it turns out , learned of @entity21 's whereabouts after the tactical options were already worked out			2
@entity3 spent part of his 2011 @entity81 dinner speech playfully mocking @entity2 over the business magnate 's involvement in a media scrum over his birth certificate @entity2 told @entity86 that he enjoyed the ribbing , which included this @entity81 mockup as @entity3 imagined it in a @entity2 administration @entity2 , who has rhetorically body - slammed the president at nearly every opportunity , had kind words to say about a comedy routine the president recited at his expense during the 2011 @entity81 dinner			1
' i thought it was funny , ' he told @entity86			2
' i really had a good time			0
' ' @entity3 was telling jokes about me			0
and i said to my wife , " this is amazing			0
here 's the president of the @entity1 , he 's up in front of 6,000 people , and all he 's talking about is me			0
" i had a great time			0
' on the night of that speech , history now shows , @entity3 was waiting for word from the @entity54 and @entity73 about whether the @entity21 raid was underway			1
@entity2 , though , was dismissive about the president 's part in it all			0
' @entity3 made the decision , but who would n't have made that decision ? ' he asked			0
' would somebody actually have said , " do n't go after him " ? '			0

@entity2 sat down with @entity86 and cited the @entity21 ' kill raid ' as an example of something @entity3 did well
but the *pronouncement* was a *backhanded* *compliment*
' when the @entity20 went in , they did fantastic work , ' @entity2 said . ' @entity3 happened to be there '
on the night when @entity20 were en route to @entity47 , @entity45 to ' kill or capture ' @entity21 , @entity3 was mocking @entity2 in a comic speech
@entity2 recalled the 2011 @entity81 dinner , which included joke after joke at his expense , calling it ' fun ' and ' amazing '
