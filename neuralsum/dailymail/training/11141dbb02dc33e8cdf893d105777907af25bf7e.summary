before discussing @entity2 ’s latest wonder round at the @entity3 it ’s worth stressing that the @entity5 measures almost 7,700 yards and more than a third of the field comprising the @entity9 ’s top 60 golfers failed to break par. @entity2 , who has never shot worse than the regulation mark in 21 rounds here dating back to 2009 , shot a bogey - free 66 to be tied for the lead with @entity16 @entity15 after the first day and lower his course average to 68.2 strokes			1
to put that utterly ludicrous figure into context , only six players managed to better that mark on tuesday			2
this was the world no 1 ’s sixth score of 66 , to place alongside five 67s , two 68s , two 69s , five 71s and that solitary 72			2
again , for the purposes of perspective , @entity27 shot 73 , @entity30 75 , while recent tour winners @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 shot 74 , 76 and 78 respectively			2
yes , on the @entity35 really is otherworldly			0
@entity2 tees off on the first hole during the first round of the @entity3 in @entity38 the @entity39 shot 66 to be tied for the lead with @entity16 @entity15 after the first day @entity2 had suggested in the build - up that six weeks away from the game would sharpen his appetite rather than dull his competitive edge and so it proved			1
remember the start he made to his singles match at the @entity48 , where he blew @entity49 away in the first few holes ? here we had more of the same , and five holes worth of shot - making to begin with that illustrated once more why he has moved several strides ahead of the competition during this stellar year			2
standing on the sixth tee , he was already breathing down the necks of the leaders			0
he was four under par and would have been five but for a missed birdie putt from short length at the third			0
sometimes , though , it ’s the putts for par that are far more important			0
one came at the difficult 12th where , following a relatively humdrum run of six straight pars , he was actually in danger of dropping a stroke			0
but a beautifully played pitch left him a six - foot putt , which he holed			0
@entity2 was already four under par on the sixth hole after narrowly missing out on a birdie on the third the 25 - year - old lines up a putt on the first green to begin his wonder round at the @entity5 @entity2 's supporters were out in full force to see him from whatever vantage points they could find @entity2 returned to the birdie trail with 12 - foot putts at the 15th and 16th			1
now he is threatening to effectively wrap up the destination of this title before the 72nd hole on sunday , having completed formalities already in the race to @entity38			0
why does this course suit him so ? it ’s a bomber ’s paradise , pure and simple , and no - one pounds it longer and straighter than @entity2			1
as his playing partner @entity102 — no slouch himself — said : ‘ with his length he was able to take on a couple of carries i could n’t manage and , as he was in position @entity100 pretty much all day , it gave him a huge advantage			2
’ @entity2 could hardly contain his enthusiasm in the build - up to the first round			1
‘ just under three hours until i hit my first competitive golf shot in six weeks			1
to say i ’m excited is an understatement , ’ he tweeted , complete with the daring hashtag : # imready			0
well , daring until he ’d played the first five holes anyway , and showed he was more than ready			0
the picturesque @entity111 in @entity38 saw some of @entity2 's finest golf on thursday before teeing off @entity2 could harldy contain his excitement but gave a perfectly composed performance much of @entity2 ’s time away was spent preparing legal documents for a forthcoming courtroom showdown with his former management company , @entity118			1
how ironic , then , that the only man who should match him on this day was @entity118 - managed @entity15			1
@entity15 is 52nd in the world and needs a good finish here to break into the top 50 and secure a first invitation to the masters			1
he ’s squandered a couple of good opportunities already in recent weeks and admitted : ‘ it has been on my mind for a while			0
’ it certainly did not show down the run - in here , as he picked up four shots in the final six holes			0
one man who will not be conceding the title to @entity2 at this stage is in - form defending champion @entity102 , who shot 68			1
comeback of the day came from @entity140 @entity139 , who played the first 10 holes in a horrible four over but the last eight in five under to salvage a 71 .			2

@entity2 hit an opening round 66 at the @entity3
@entity39 has never shot worse than the regulation mark in 21 rounds at the @entity5 since 2009
@entity2 's 66 tied him for the lead with @entity15 after the first day
outstanding feat lowered his course average to 68.2 strokes
