by @entity0 @entity1 : 01:45 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:27 est , 21 december 2013 two @entity4 astronauts will be sent into space this weekend on an urgent mission to repair a broken cooling line that led to the shutdown of several systems at the @entity10			1
four spacewalks are necessary to replace the pump with a bad valve , @entity11 said on wednesday			1
@entity11 says it is now ready should a similar incident happen again			2
‘ some smart engineers on the ground said , hey , this looks like a snorkel you ’d use for scuba diving , ’ explained @entity42 , @entity11 's lead @entity4 spacewalk officer			1
@entity11 realized that a water - line vent tube could be snipped down and attached with @entity50 within the spacesuit , between a water restraint valve and the astronaut			1
‘ this is your last resort … if water is in your suit you can lean down and use this to breathe , ’ @entity42 said			0
the space agency also installed absorptive pads in the back of each helmet , which will soak up any water that shows up like a sponge			2
the spacewalkers have been trained to tilt their heads back periodically to test the pad , she said ; if it sucks up around 6 and a half ounces of water , it will feel “ squishy ” -- a sure sign of trouble			0
‘ that ’s a sign there is a problem in the @entity76 and it ’s time to come inside , ’ @entity42 said			0
rescue mechanism : @entity42 , @entity11 's lead @entity4 spacewalk officer , says the snorkel is the last resort for the astronauts should they get water in their suit the solutions sound makeshift but the situation is real , though the faulty pump is far from life - threatening , according to @entity40			1
astronaut @entity88 said last week that the station 's navigation , lights , toilet and other vital systems still work			2
the failed cooling unit is largely affecting the astronauts ability to do science aboard the orbiting space base , explained @entity98 , @entity10 flight director			1
the space station cooling system , which runs ammonia through the lines , is critical for dispelling heat generated by on - board equipment - mainly science projects at present			1
‘ the pump is actually running , but ca n’t integrate with internal water loop , ’ @entity98 said			0
‘ we ’re running cold , that ’s the issue			0
we want to be able to close the valve and we ca n’t do it			0
’ when half of the station 's cooling system shut down last wednesday , it forced the six - man crew to turn off all nonessential equipment , including some science experiments			1
because of the valve failure , one of the two cooling lines became too cold			2
space station : the failed cooling unit is largely affecting the astronauts ability to do science aboard the orbiting space base , which is why two spacewalkers are being sent out there to replace the fault valve while the astronauts are safe and comfortable , @entity11 wants the system back up to full strength , in case of another failure that could leave the orbiting outpost even more vulnerable than it is right now			1
flight controllers tried in vain to fix the valve remotely , then came up with a plan to use another valve to regulate the temperature			0
some success was reported , and for a while , engineers thought the space station could limp along with the short - term solution			1
instead managers have opted for spacewalks right now			0
‘ it ’ll take about three [ spacewalks ] , it could be less if we get lucky … or more if we ’re not lucky , ’ said @entity150 , @entity10 program manager			0
this is the same pump that was replaced by a pair of spacewalking astronauts in 2010 , although different things malfunctioned at the time -- that was the pump itself , now it ’s just a valve			1
but three spacewalks were needed then as well			0
potential danger : @entity165 , one of the astronauts to be sent into space this weekend , will be wearing the very same suit that nearly flooded on spacewalker @entity29 @entity88 and astronaut @entity170 trained for just such a repair before rocketing into orbit			1
they have been prepping all week , just in case of just such a decision			0
the potential risk of a flooded space helmet is very real , however ; in fact , @entity165 will be wearing the very same suit that nearly flooded on spacewalker @entity29			2
@entity11 has scrubbed the suit , added new parts to it , notably a fan pump separator , and considers it as good as a brand new one			2
‘ we think that ’s an extremely clean suit and it 's ready to go , ’ @entity42 said			0
‘ we have high confidence that it ’s essentially just like a unit that was refurbished on the ground			0

two @entity4 astronauts will be sent into space this weekend on an urgent mission to repair a broken cooling line
a pump with a bad valve caused the shutdown of several systems at the @entity10
a spacewalking astronaut nearly drowned in his helmet in july , so @entity11 has given its crew snorkels in case it happens again
one of the @entity4 will be given the same suit as the one worn in the july incident
the space station cooling system is critical for dispelling heat generated by on - board equipment - currently that is mainly science projects
