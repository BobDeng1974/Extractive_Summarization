maybe one day far in the future humans will be capable of flying past huge cosmic structures like nebulae			2
for now it ’s just the stuff of fantasy			0
but a series of animations aim to mimic that experience as closely as possible by letting you fly around and through these giant regions of dust and gas			0
the result is a stunning array of cosmic objects , from the @entity16 to the @entity17 , revealed in glorious @entity18			1
a @entity20 astrophotographer has created amazing 3d animations of nebulae			1
shown here is @entity24 15 , an open cluster of stars in the @entity27 about 7,500 light - years away the animations were created by @entity20 astrophotographer @entity29			1
he created all of them himself using an observatory in the city of @entity36 in @entity20			1
using known distances to stars , and some guesswork , he creates the estimations of how the cosmic regions might look in @entity18			2
a nebula , which comes from the @entity44 word for ‘ cloud ’ , is a region of gas and dust in space			2
some are the remains of dead stars that have expelled their gas , whereas others are regions where new stars are being formed			2
they come in a variety of shapes and sizes			0
there are four main types : planetary nebulae , reflection nebulae , absorption nebulae and emission nebulae , the latter of which were focused on by @entity69			2
‘ my 3d experiments are a mixture of science and an artistic impression , ’ @entity69 tells @entity70			2
‘ i collect distance and other information before i do my 3d conversion			0
’ to work out how a nebula might look in three dimensions @entity69 looks up the distances to known stars , so that they can be placed at the correct location			1
and if the distance to the nebula is known , he fine tunes the distance to the stars so that the right amount of stars are in front and behind the object			1
‘ i use a “ rule of thumb ” method for stars : brighter is closer , ’ he explains			0
‘ but if a real distance is known , i try to use it			0
’ in each can be seen the structure , shape and features of the objects			1
shown here is the full @entity27 , also called @entity27 , in three dimensions the @entity103 with the @entity104 in the constellation @entity102 is seen here by looking carefully at the structures in nebulae he says their shape can be discerned , with most star - forming regions like these having similar structures			1
for instance most nebulae have a group of newly born young stars as an open cluster inside the nebula			1
the stellar wind from these says blows the gas away around the cluster , forming a sort of ‘ hole ’ around the centre			0
pillar - like formations of dust and gas also point to a source of stellar wind			0
@entity29 processes all of this information in a process he likens to ‘ sculpting ’ and then comes up with the resulting animation , which is ‘ always an approximate reality ’			1
@entity135 is the @entity136 , an emission nebula in the constellation @entity138 the @entity140 , a supernova remnant 1,470 light - years away , is seen here he continues : ‘ astronomical imaging is a passion of mine ! ‘ all aspects of art , science and technique are needed for a good photo			0
‘ even though my images fulfil rules of scientific imaging , this is an art form and a self - expression channel for me			0
‘ there is so much beauty around us , hidden from our limited senses , and i enjoy being able to reveal it			0
@entity163 imaging is a form of nature imaging			0
’ he adds that the 3d animations help to show that astronomical objects are not like paintings in canvas but real three - dimensional forms , floating in three - dimensional space			1
this animation shows the @entity17 , also called @entity17			1

a @entity20 astrophotographer has created @entity167 of nebulae
in each can be seen the structure , shape and features of the objects
@entity29 created the images using known images to certain stars
he then estimates how the rest of the nebula might look in 3d
nebulae he focuses on *include* the @entity16 and the @entity17
