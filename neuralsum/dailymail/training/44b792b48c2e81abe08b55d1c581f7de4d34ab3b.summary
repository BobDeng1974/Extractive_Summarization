this caged tiger ( pictured ) was given two live mice for a snack to cheer it up - only for the three animals to end up becoming friends sandokan the tiger became depressed after his life partner of 13 years died at the zoo they shared in the city of @entity11 in eastern @entity12 instead of eating the tiny mice , the tiger lets the tiny creatures wander around his cage - and even play in his fur after racking their brains to come up with another solution , zoo staff decided the best thing would be to find him some alternative amusement			1
they released two mice into his cage - but rather than eating the tiny animals , he lets them wander around his cage and even play in his fur			1
zoo spokesman @entity38 said : ' after his partner died last year we became very worried about @entity41 because he stopped eating and began gnawing at his own tail			2
' it was very clear that he was mourning the loss			0
' other zoos tend to use medical treatments to cure animals of this sort of thing but that would have meant administering the drugs with a tranquilliser gun , which can be very traumatic for the animals			0
head keeper @entity54 said : ' it is certainly weird seeing mice in the cage with a tiger , but neither seems to have a problem with the other so why not ? ' zoo staff say @entity41 is ' back to his old self ' and has overcome the depression that set in after his life partner died staff had assumed that the male tiger would eat the mice once they were let lose in his cage ' so we wanted to come up with a better solution and then we hit upon the idea of giving him a few live mice to play with , assuming that he would probably eat them			1
' but instead he befriended them , making them into his new pals			0
mice are great pets for humans as they are friendly and happily will interact but we did n't reckon a tiger would want them as a pet , but he did and now he is back to his old self			0
' he happily lets the mice run around and play in his fur and the three live together just great			1
' head keeper @entity54 said : ' it is certainly weird seeing mice in the cage with a tiger , but neither seems to have a problem with the other so why not ? i have however never seen anything like this and i was really surprised he did n't just eat the mice			0
