the agreement , which still needs a judge 's approval , was made with an @entity12 where three of the children had lived before they were placed in the home outfitted with wire and wood enclosures			1
the adopted and foster children were between 1 and 14 in 2005 when authorities took them from the home near @entity20 , where they lived with their adoptive parents , @entity23 and @entity24			1
the @entity25 spent two years in prison for abusing some of the children			2
they had always maintained that they kept some of the children in the cages for their own safety			1
locked up : @entity23 and @entity24 , pictured in @entity20 , @entity12 in 2007 , were jailed for 2 years after their adopted children were found sleeping in cages			1
the children have just won a $ 2 million settlement they lost custody in 2006 and all 11 of the children were placed with foster parents			1
the oldest two are in college and have used the money from earlier settlements to pay for tuition , said @entity45 , an attorney for the children			0
the rest are doing well , @entity45 said , though some scars remain			0
the children were wrongly portrayed as troubled during the trial of the @entity25 , he said			0
' these kids were good kids , ' @entity45 said			0
' it 's amazing the positive results you see on children who are placed in a loving , caring home			2
' the settlements , he said , will allow them to move forward now			0
there have been seven public and private financial settlements with counties and agencies that had a role in placing the children in the home and some of the professionals who were charged with their placement and overseeing their care			2
the latest and final settlement was agreed upon last week when officials in @entity71 , where three siblings lived before being placed with @entity25 , signed off on the $ 2 million payout			2
cruel : the children , aged between one and 14 , were locked up in caged made from wood and wire confines : the adoptive parents claimed that the children were locked up because they were dangerous the county will pay $ 100,000 while the rest will come from its insurers			1
county officials maintain they did nothing wrong			0
@entity71 had assurances from another county where the @entity25 lived that they were fit to be adoptive parents and that the children would be monitored , said @entity90 , who oversees the civil division of the @entity71 prosecutor 's office			1
' with the benefit of hindsight , these children were placed in a very bad situation , ' @entity90 said			0
officials in @entity98 , where the @entity25 lived , agreed to a $ 1.2 million settlement in 2010			0
terms of the other settlements were confidential and not released			0
the investigation into how the children ended up in the home led the state to increase oversight in cases of multiple special - needs children in one home .			2

the children were between the ages of 1 and 14 when they were found in @entity113 , @entity12 home in 2005
their adoptive parents @entity23 and @entity24 claimed the cages were for the kids ' own safety - but they were later jailed for two years
this settlement is with the @entity12 where three of the children had lived before they were placed at the home
