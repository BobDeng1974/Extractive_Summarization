@entity13 sheriff @entity12 's office revealed late wednesday that it was agreeing to disband a controversial squad that has raided businesses to arrest more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen ids to get jobs			1

@entity13 sheriff @entity12 says he 's disbanding his criminal employment squad , ending his last major foothold in immigration enforcement after the courts and federal government have gradually reined in his powers in recent years the revelation that @entity12 was voluntarily closing his criminal employment squad comes after the sheriff 's office was stripped of special federal immigration powers , found to have racially profiled @entity37 in traffic stops , and investigated by federal authorities for alleged civil rights violations			1
the courts also have thrown out many of @entity1 's immigration laws			0

but it issued a statement saying the squad will be disbanded early next year , and that grant money used in the enforcement of the @entity59 theft laws will be returned to the state			0
the revelation that @entity12 was voluntarily closing his criminal employment squad comes after the sheriff 's office was stripped of special federal immigration powers , found to have racially profiled @entity37 in traffic stops , and investigated by federal authorities for alleged civil rights violations the sheriff 's road to immigration enforcement began in 2005 as voter frustrations grew over the state 's status as the then - busiest in immigrant smuggling and state lawmakers started responding to their complaints about @entity1 's porous border with @entity75			1
like other local police bosses , @entity12 previously left immigration enforcement to federal authorities			1

critics say @entity12 picked on powerless immigrants because it was popular with voters			2

@entity12 's immigration efforts reached their peak around 2010 when he launched immigration patrols known as ' sweeps			1
' during those stings , deputies flooded part of a city — in some cases , heavily @entity128 areas — over several days to seek out traffic violators and other offenders			0
