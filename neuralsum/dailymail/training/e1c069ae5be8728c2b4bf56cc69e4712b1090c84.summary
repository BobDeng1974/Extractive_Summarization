' because @entity24 is full , operating at more than 99 per cent of permitted runway capacity , there are no gaps in the schedule that can be used for delayed flights			1

' the fog has had nowhere to go as it was trapped under low clouds with no change of air mass. ' the poor weather came as thick mist caused havoc yesterday , forcing flights to be cancelled across the @entity3 's airports			1
