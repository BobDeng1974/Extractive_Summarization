a report demolished @entity43 's claim that he saved thousands of lives , by steering the ship into shore though court - appointed experts concluded that the crew and owner @entity97 , a unit of @entity100 - based @entity99 , committed blunders and safety breaches which contributed to the tragedy off the island 's rocky coast , only captain @entity43 has been ordered to stand trial			1
prosecutors contend that on the night of january 13 2012 , he steered the ship too close to the island 's coastline in a publicity stunt for @entity97 and accidentally rammed the jagged reef			1

on @entity21 , where residents depend on tourism and fishing for their livelihoods , the wreckage still mars the panorama from the island 's port			0
