@entity0 admits it was n't just his body left battered and bruised from @entity3 's below - par autumn internationals but his ego too after losing his place in @entity8 's starting xv			1
he may have seen @entity10 8 @entity9 move ahead of him in the @entity3 pecking order in november but his autumn snub and subsequent injury has made @entity0 hungrier than ever to nail down his international jersey ahead of next year 's @entity15			1
heading into the autumn tests the @entity3 no 8 shirt seemed firmly in @entity0 's grasp , but things began to unravel in the november opener against @entity24 , the world champions teaching @entity0 a thing or two about ball retention as he managed just four carries as the @entity24 won at @entity25			1
@entity0 did not have a good autumn international series in an @entity3 shirt things failed to improve as @entity29 also left @entity30 triumphant the following weekend , with @entity0 dropped altogether for @entity3 's win over @entity32			1
in an effort to force his way back in @entity8 plans while back with @entity35 ; @entity0 suffered a concussion against @entity37 which again meant he played no part as @entity3 signed off from 2014 by putting @entity39 to the sword			1
while @entity0 was on the sidelines @entity9 was staking his claim to be @entity44 's go - to man for the @entity3 no 8 jersey			1
the @entity10 man scored against @entity39 en route to being named man of the match â€“ but @entity0 insists he is not giving up without a fight			2
' the autumn was certainly a massively frustrating time for me but at the same time it was also a huge learning curve , ' he said			0
@entity0 is hoping to impress for @entity35 to win his @entity3 place back ahead of the @entity15 ' i think heading into the autumn i maybe got carried away with my form for @entity35 and maybe i was just a bit too over-confident , not necessarily on the pitch but perhaps more off it with my religion and faith and everything			1
' but maybe being dropped will actually benefit me and turn out to be a good thing because i have learnt so much off the back of it			0
' i have never been in a situation like that , just for whatever reason i could n't transfer my club form over to my country , but sometimes it goes like that and you need to get back on the horse and i am excited about doing that			0
' i am still learning and i have a long way to go but i am determined to win back my place and i will do all i can to do exactly that			0
' being dropped is more than enough motivation for @entity0 to once again reach the heady heights he hit when he burst on to the international scene last year			2
@entity0 knows he has work to do if he is to secure his place in the @entity3 side for the @entity15 but just in case he needed it , a fast approaching @entity85 followed by a @entity15 on home soil is giving the @entity87 that extra boost			1
' one lesson i learnt from the autumn is that you ca n't think too far ahead , you have to take each game as they come and focus on that , ' he added			0
' i know i have to play well to even be included in the squad for the @entity85 but i do keep thinking about what playing a @entity15 game at @entity25 would be like			2
' i would love to play in a @entity15 in @entity3 , in an @entity3 shirt , and that gives me extra motivation to get back in the side			2
' @entity9 is a very good player and he showed that last month and it is great that we can push each other on			0
' we both want to play but only one can so we will both be trying our hardest to make sure we are the ones with the shirt in time for the @entity85			0
' @entity0 is a @entity106 ambassador			0
