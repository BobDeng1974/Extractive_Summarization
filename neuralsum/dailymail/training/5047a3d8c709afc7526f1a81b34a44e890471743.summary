on wednesday it was the typically press shy @entity1 who made the headlines instead of her husband , disgraced former congressman @entity5			1
first , she and @entity5 appeared in a @entity7 spread where she declared that she is proud to be married to her husband even after the @entity10 sexting scandal that forced him to resign his position as a @entity13 representative for part of the @entity16 borough in @entity17			0
then she was a hot topic among @entity20 politicians , with some - like @entity21 - deriding her with claims that her family has connections to @entity26 's @entity25 , and others - like @entity28 - coming to her defense			1
trusted : @entity21 says ms @entity1 's position is highly sensitive and she could abuse it , effectively because of falsified rumors about her @entity25 family 's connections ' @entity1 represents what is best about @entity51 : the daughter of immigrants , who has risen to the highest levels of our government on the basis of her substantial personal merit and her abiding commitment to the @entity51 ideals that she embodies so fully			1
' @entity28 said in his speech on the @entity63 floor			0
' i am proud to know @entity1 , and to call her my friend			0
' @entity21 , who rose to national prominence during her failed bid for position of this year ’s @entity20 presidential candidate , alleged that ms @entity1 ’s deceased father , mother , and brother are connected to the @entity25 , the controversial political opposition group who often works against @entity51 interest in @entity76 states			1
touting her role on the @entity78 , representative @entity21 wrote a letter - which was co-signed by four other congressmen - alleging that given ms @entity1 ’s highly - sensitive position in ms @entity37 ’s staff , she is effectively a national security threat due to her fictitious connections to the @entity25			1
in the letter , which was sent to the deputy inspector general of the @entity88 and the director of national intelligence among others , mrs @entity21 and her co-signers gave no traces of evidence of their findings			2
mr @entity28 made a clear attack on the statements , drawing on his own personal experience having been the victim of false rumors during his multiple presidential campaigns , and having his heroism questioned in spite of his strong military record which included many years as a prisoner during the @entity105			0
stay at home dad : @entity5 has been taking care of his new son @entity108 while his wife @entity1 continues her high - powered job at @entity37 's top aide well connected : ms @entity1 has stood quietly by her husband @entity5 in the wake of his sexting scandal last year that lead to his resignation he said that he knows the pain that is cause ' when a person 's character , reputation and patriotism are attacked			1
' ' when anyone , not least a member of @entity125 , launches specious and degrading attacks against fellow @entity51 on the basis of nothing more than fear of who they are and ignorance of what they stand for , it defames the spirit of our nation , and we all grow poorer because of it , ' he said			0
‘ to say that the accusations made in both documents are not substantiated by the evidence they offer is to be overly polite and diplomatic about it			0
‘ the letter in the report offer not one instance of an action , a decision or a public position that @entity1 has taken while at the @entity88 or as a member of then - senator @entity152 's staff that would lend credence to the charge that she is promoting anti-american activities within our government			2
’ in the shadows : a then - pregnant @entity1 ( left in both shots ) was the one to hand @entity152 her @entity160 when the news came through that @entity162 had been killed defender : @entity28 dismissed the letter about @entity1 as reckless and said that he was honored to call her a friend mrs @entity37 ’s staff clearly appreciated the bi-lateral support that he showed in renouncing the move			2
mrs @entity37 ’s spokesman @entity169 dismissed the accusations , calling them ' nothing but vicious and disgusting lies , and anyone who traffics in them should be ashamed of themselves			0
i would hope that hearing the remarkable statement from someone of senator @entity28 's stature gives her ( @entity21 ) pause in doing so any further			2
' in response , mrs @entity21 said that her words were being twisted and that the point of her letters was ' to outline the serious national security concerns i had and ask for answers to questions regarding the @entity25 and other radical group 's access to top @entity191 administration officials			1
