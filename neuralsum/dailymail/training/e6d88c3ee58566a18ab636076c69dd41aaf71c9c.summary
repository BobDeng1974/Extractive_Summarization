the scene , the date and , most significantly , the words remain crystal clear			0
it is july 2012 and at @entity7 ’s @entity6 training ground a film crew is working on a fly - on - the - wall documentary			1
@entity10 , who is on the brink of completing a £ 15million move to @entity13 , is warmly greeted by @entity14 , given they had worked together at @entity17 ’s new manager turns to the camera and delivers a standout line			1
‘ this is the @entity21 , ’ @entity14 proclaims			1
as far as build - ups go , this one could not have been any bigger			2
a comparison with one of the greatest @entity26 footballers in history guaranteed that rather than being able to slip quietly into his new surroundings , as he may have wanted , the spotlight was instantly shining on @entity10			2
though he began brightly , @entity10 ’s form tailed off in his first campaign and , during last season ’s charge for the title , he only made 15 starts			1
given that @entity14 has spent much of this summer recruiting a plethora of new midfield options , it would seem @entity10 is facing a fight to live up to that exalted billing but , to stand next to him , you can see he has prepared himself extensively for the battle that lies ahead			1
when he first walked through the doors , he was elfin in stature but now , thanks to a extensive hours in the gym and the advice of @entity7 ’s conditioning team , @entity10 is sporting a considerably more muscular frame and his shoulders are significantly bulkier to carry that expectation			1
beefing up : @entity10 cuts a more muscular figure after extensive work in the gym pass master : @entity10 completed almost 90 % of passes in the @entity70 last season ‘ it has been a process over the last season , really , ’ says @entity10			1
‘ i have been much more focused in that department			0
when you have a few injuries , you get more into a routine in the gym but it was something that i needed to do			2
‘ i can definitely feel the benefits of it and i think there is a bit more to do			0
it is about getting those marginal gains			0
you have to realise how much of a difference it can make			0
’ clearly he is ready for the fight			2
@entity10 is never happier than when he is at his rural home with his young family , but , equally , the responsibility of thriving for @entity7 is not something he will ever shirk			1
‘ for some people the @entity21 comparison could probably be an albatross , ’ he adds			2
‘ but , then again , he is some player to be compared to			0
if i ’m honest , i do n’t take things like that too serious even if some people have maybe used that in a negative way			0
’ stalled : the @entity102 midfielder only made 15 starts during @entity7 's push for the title last season top boyo ! @entity14 brought @entity10 for £ 15m after working with him at @entity108 @entity14 remains a huge admirer of his talents but the @entity102 international knows it is crucial over the coming 12 months to establish himself			1
the talent is certainly there			0
his passing accuracy percentage for last season was 89.68 and , with @entity7 having the @entity117 added to their workload , he will have a role to play as @entity14 looks to consistently find a winning blend while preserving freshness			1
how , though , will he become one of the main men ? @entity125 ’s untimely injury might offer him a chance to profit and , in the early hours of monday morning , when @entity7 face @entity127 here in the @entity129 , @entity10 will be ready			1
‘ it is a big year personally , of course , but every year is at a club like this , ’ he explains			0
‘ we have lost a world class player , in @entity136			0
but the club are reinvesting and we have brought in some really quality players			0
this season we go again			2
we can dream of going one step further			0

@entity10 moved to @entity7 from @entity108 for £ 15m in 2012
@entity142 manager @entity14 labelled him ' the @entity21 '
@entity102 international is ready to step up after starting only 15 games in the @entity70 last season
@entity10 has been spending time in the gym to build his slight frame
