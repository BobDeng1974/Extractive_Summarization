a @entity1 professor is under fire after suggesting the the @entity4 military poses a bigger threat than @entity6			1
in an article @entity9 who is an instructor in the university 's @entity13 program says , ' it would not be a stretch to say that the @entity4 is actually a greater threat to peace and stability in the region than @entity6			2
' the piece , entitled how much @entity20 does the @entity4 have over @entity6 ? the instructor portrays @entity4 soldiers as @entity23 rapists who commit crimes on par with - or even worse than @entity6 itself			1
outspoken : @entity1 faculty member @entity9 claimed in an online column that the @entity4 military is as much of a threat to @entity30 peace as @entity6 @entity32 's comments , published in the online publication @entity33 and several other places , attracted outrage from experts who said that taxpayer funds should not be supplementing a university that encourages such dialogue about current events			1
' @entity4 policies in @entity43 , @entity44 , and @entity45 have largely paved the way for @entity6 's emergence as a major regional actor , ' @entity9 wrote			0
@entity32 argues that the isolated instances of @entity4 soldiers committing atrocities including rape , for which they face court - martial and imprisonment if found guilty , are on a level with the widespread and systematic brutality of @entity58 radicals ' many of the same behaviors condemned by the @entity62 administration and used to justify its most recent campaign into @entity43 and @entity45 are commonly perpetrated by @entity4 troops and are ubiquitous in the broader @entity4 society , ' @entity9 said			1
@entity67 : @entity32 claimed that the isolated instances of @entity4 soldiers committing atrocities including rape , for which they face court - martial and imprisonment if found guilty , are on a level with the widespread and systematic brutality of @entity58 radicals vocal : @entity32 also claimed that the @entity4 military has been ' heavily infiltrated by white supremacists , neo-nazis , and other hate groups			1
' ' the initial driver of @entity4 involvement was the outrage over @entity6 ' capture of thousands of @entity81 women and the sexual violence subsequently exercised against them — horrors which provided moral credence to the war against @entity6 in much the same way that the 2001 @entity4 war against the @entity88 was justified in part by highlighting the plight of @entity92 women living under their rule , ' he wrote			2
' however , over the course of that war , and the subsequent 2003 war in @entity43 , @entity4 soldiers and contractors repeatedly used rape as a weapon of war , both against prisoners and the local civilian population , ' @entity9 writes			2
' but perhaps more disturbing than the crimes committed by @entity4 personnel against @entity43 and @entity92 were the atrocities committed by servicemen against their fellow soldiers			1
' ' @entity4 soldiers and contractors have and continue to torture their enemies , often taking obscene photos to brag about and reminisce upon their acts , ' @entity9 writes			2
he then goes on to claim that the @entity4 military has been ' heavily infiltrated by white - supremacists , neo-nazis , and other hate groups			1
' candid : @entity32 said he is trying address tough questions in provocative ways critics of the piece are calling for the @entity1 to condemn his views			0
the @entity1 has issued at statement regarding the article : @entity124 , the author of the opinion piece , was not writing for any part of his employment at the @entity1			0
he is a limited term adjunct instructor who teaches one class this semester and is a member of a volunteer research collective that receives no state or university funding			0
he wrote the editorial as a private citizen			0
the op - ed is his personal opinion and labeled as such			0
the ideas expressed in mr. @entity139 's opinion piece have offended and distressed many in the @entity1 community and beyond			0
we also acknowledge his @entity144 right that allows him to publish his thoughts as a private citizen .			0

@entity124 argued that @entity4 ’s moral outrage at @entity150 ’s crimes is *hypocritical*
@entity32 goes on to argue that @entity4 soldiers commit atrocities , including rape , that are on a level with the crimes committed by @entity150 ’s radical militants
he also goes on to claim that the @entity4 military has been ' heavily infiltrated by white - supremacists , neo-nazis , and other hate groups '
