@entity0 , 81 , who hid a £ 1bn trove of suspected stolen @entity3 art has died in his @entity5 flat the ownership of a £ 1billion hoard of masterpieces plundered by the @entity9 during the @entity10 has been thrown into doubt by the death of its keeper			1
@entity0 , 81 , whose father @entity15 built the collection while working for @entity17 , died in the @entity5 flat where he kept the paintings			1
they included works by @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 that were either looted or bought from @entity25 at knock - down prices			2
mr @entity0 , an eccentric recluse , had been selling them over the years to support himself			2
the collection of more than 1,400 works was discovered in a raid by customs officials in 2012 , but news of its existence only surfaced last november amid tax and ownership disputes			1
mr @entity0 never married or had children , but a number of his cousins could qualify as heirs to the collection			2
however , experts said his death could leave the paintings in legal limbo for years to come			0
‘ what will become of his treasure ? ’ one newspaper asked			0
@entity50 added : ‘ how much was his and how much was @entity3 art ? he leaves behind as many puzzles as pictures			1
’ mr @entity0 , who had been ill with a heart condition , learnt just two months ago that he would be allowed to keep several hundred paintings after prosecutors said they could find no evidence that they had been looted			1
he claimed all the paintings were legally acquired by his father , but at least 500 were found to have been either stolen by the @entity9 or were strong - armed from @entity25 collectors at rock - bottom prices			2
mr @entity0 ’s father was @entity3 ’s leading expert on modern art , personally tasked by @entity17 to sell paintings he despised abroad to help fund the @entity3 ’s war effort			1
however , mr @entity66 secretly kept many of the pictures for himself			0
after the war , he was questioned by the @entity71 ’s ‘ @entity72 ’ unit but never charged with any crimes			0
he lied that the bulk of his collection had been destroyed in the @entity77 bombing of @entity78 in 1945			0
in fact , the artworks survived intact and he passed them on to his son , a lifelong bachelor , who said before his death : ‘ i never loved anything or anybody in life but my paintings			2
’ the collection , which includes works by @entity24 , @entity23 and @entity91 was discovered inside his @entity5 apartment under a new deal with prosecutors , art historians will have a year to examine the 1,401 works to establish where they came from and if they were stolen ( pictured , a work by @entity91 ) in 2011 , he was investigated as a possible tax fraudster when he was found with money he could not explain , but investigators later found paintings hidden behind tins of beans and out - of - date food in his flat			1
in february this year , more paintings , worth at least £ 100million , were found in a house he owned in @entity107 , @entity108			2
but a court decided he could get between 300 and 350 paintings back			0
under the terms of deal , the art will be held at a secret location for a year while historians carry out background checks on each of the paintings			2
at the end of this year any painting which investigators had not finished studying would have been handed back to the 81 - year - old			0
@entity124 state prosecutor @entity123 said at the time : ' we have come across new evidence in the course of the investigation ... that leads us to re-evaluate the legal situation			0
' @entity0 's lawyer @entity132 applauded the decision to release the art , saying : ' it 's a good day for @entity0			1
' the @entity137 government came under fire - especially by families whose relatives were robbed by the @entity9 - for keeping silent for almost two years about the trove of art works			1
@entity0 was arrested in 2012 but it was n't until last year that knowledge of the collection became public			2
separately , representatives for @entity0 later secured a further 238 artworks at a dilapidated house he owned in @entity107 , @entity108			0
@entity0 was never under investigation in @entity108 and those works were n't seized by authorities			2
@entity0 was set to have the paintings returned at the end of the year if investigators could not unearth whether they were stolen ( painting by @entity23 ) one of the pieces of work discovered in his flat was this masterpiece by @entity160 last year it transpired that mr @entity0 had given four of his paintings to his brother - in - law			1
they may also have been looted by the @entity9 , according to the authorities			0
what happens to the artwork now remains to be seen			0
it could go to mr @entity0 's younger sister , @entity169 , but she would have to be named in a will - and such a document has yet to surface			1
@entity172 , director and @entity174 , told @entity175 : ' it 's a pretty murky situation			0
we do n't know if he left a will			0
if his lawyers were smart they would have cleared up the issue in advance			0
it 'll get cleared up over the next couple of days			0
' one of the works of art in the trove - a @entity23 valued at up to £ 60million - has been claimed by the ex-wife of @entity189			1
sitting woman is thought to have belonged to @entity192 ’s maternal grandfather , the late @entity193 art dealer @entity191			1
mr @entity172 is representing the @entity191 family and added that he 's confident it will be returned to them			0
he said that a second claim for the painting had ' been dispensed with '			0
@entity0 stayed out of sight after news of his collection broke , barely talking to media , and was apparently overwhelmed by the publicity			0
in january , his representatives said they were considering claims for some of the works and that he was seeking ‘ fair and just solutions ’ to the case			0
‘ so much has happened in the past weeks and months , and is still happening , ’ he wrote on a newly created website shortly afterward			0
‘ i only wanted to live with my pictures , in peace and calm			0
’ @entity0 was born in @entity214 in 1932 and came from a prominent @entity137 family of artists , composers and collectors , but little is known about his life beyond his position as the heir of his father @entity15 's art collection			1
when @entity226 investigators questioned @entity227 after the end of @entity10 about the origins of his collection , they were doubtful whether all the pieces really belonged to him but eventually decided that he was the rightful owner of most of them			0
after his father 's 1956 death in a car accident , @entity0 lived together with his mother in @entity5 until she died in 1968			1
he reportedly lived a reclusive life , making a living by selling paintings from time to time			0
experts who examined the pieces seized in @entity5 said they included both ‘ degenerate art ’ and looted art. in the frame : a painting by @entity137 artist @entity245 called @entity246 ( two @entity247 ) , which was found at @entity0 's house remarkable : a formerly unknown painting of @entity193 artist @entity250 was found at @entity0 's apartment @entity252 in @entity253 ( 1751/1800 ) by @entity254 the @entity9 took so - called degenerate art - mostly avant - garde modern art , such as expressionism - from museums and public institutions because it was deemed a corrupting influence on the @entity137 people			1
looted art was stolen or bought for a pittance from @entity25 collectors who were forced to sell under duress during the @entity3			1
for the heirs of those collectors , the discovery raised hopes of recovering art , but the slow release of information by the @entity137 government stirred frustration			0
after much back and forth , @entity0 eventually agreed last month to a deal with the @entity137 government , under which hundreds of works owned by the collector would be checked for a @entity3 - era past while staying in government hands			1

pictured is @entity300 's @entity299 ( ' @entity301 ' , about 1840 ) sketch : @entity304 's @entity303 ( undated ) prosecutors who initially confiscated all the works of art they found at his apartment then announced that they were releasing the rest of the collection			1
@entity0 's lawyers had argued that the prosecutors acted disproportionately in seizing the entire collection , and that the art was n't relevant as evidence for prosecutors ' suspicion of import tax evasion			1
@entity320 , @entity3 's culture minister , said on tuesday that @entity0 's decision to work with authorities deserved ‘ recognition and respect			1
’ ‘ it will remain to @entity0 's credit that he ... sent an exemplary signal for the search for fair and just solutions with this avowal of moral responsibility , ’ she said .			2
