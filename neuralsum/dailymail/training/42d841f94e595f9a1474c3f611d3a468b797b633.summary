@entity0 was accused of complacency over the @entity3 crisis last night as he left @entity4 to resume his beach holiday			1
the prime minister headed for @entity7 straight after breakfast yesterday having spent only 19 hours in @entity9			1
he had interrupted his family vacation following the brutal murder of @entity14 hostage @entity12 by a @entity17 @entity16 fighting with @entity18			0
but critics accused the prime minister of a dereliction of duty – and questioned why he has refused to recall @entity37 to debate mr @entity12 ’s murder and the threat to security posed by jihadis who return to the @entity17			1
in the @entity14 , president @entity43 faced similar criticism after he was pictured smiling on the golf course within minutes of giving a speech condemning the murder			0
@entity49 mp @entity48 , former @entity17 human rights envoy to @entity3 , said of mr @entity0 : ‘ i just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in @entity9 – it is just not good enough			1
if he is serious about the threat to @entity17 , as he says he is and as he ought to be , then he should not be pushing off on holiday			2
he should be recalling mps to @entity37 so that we can discuss the situation and debate our response			0
@entity0 and @entity59 enjoy a coffee at the @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity7 on tuesday ‘ thousands of police are being drafted in to police the @entity65 summit in @entity66 next month because of the threat from @entity68 and related organisations			1
that is really frightening for some people and they expect to see the prime minister taking charge			0
’ @entity73 , a @entity49 member of the commons defence committee , said mr @entity0 ’s decision sent out the wrong signal			1
‘ with the rise of @entity80 extremists we are probably facing the biggest threat to our values and the country ’s security since 9/11 , ’ he said			2
‘ the combination of the pm not being at his desk and his refusal to bring mps back to the @entity74 sends a terribly complacent signal at a time when we should be showing the world we will never tolerate these hideous incidents and these awful people			0
people will not understand why the prime minister is dipping in and out of his holidays when the rest of us are sitting frustrated in our constituencies and have to watch events on the news			0
a masked @entity18 militant holding a knife speaks - with an @entity106 accent - next to @entity14 journalist @entity12 at an unknown location journalist @entity12 in @entity109 , @entity27			0
mr @entity12 's family said their son wanted to highlight the plight of suffering @entity27 ‘ he should be holding ministers to account and speaking on behalf of the country about what we should do			2
’ many @entity119 mps are also pressing for a recall of @entity37			0
none would publicly criticise mr @entity0 for returning to the beach so quickly , but one said : ‘ the fact is we should all be recalled , not just the prime minister			1
at the moment it seems like the only way to ask him a question is to hire a @entity7 ice cream van and set up on the beach			2
’ mr @entity0 is on his second holiday of the summer			1
on monday , he insisted he was always ‘ within a few feet ’ of his mobile phone and would ‘ return instantly ’ if the situation worsened			0
that evening , is extremists released the horrific video of mr @entity12 ’s murder by a masked man with a @entity9 accent			0
the following morning foreign secretary @entity28 initially suggested that mr @entity0 would remain in @entity7			1
but within the hour mr @entity0 decided he needed to be at no. 10			1
government sources said mr @entity0 felt it was appropriate to return to @entity7 yesterday			1
sources said a secure phone line had been set up to ensure he can talk to ministers , officials and other world leaders at any time			0
mr @entity43 is also on holiday – at his vacation home in exclusive @entity151			1
he had returned to the @entity152 on sunday for two days of meetings and was flying back to @entity154 when he learned of the is video			0
he delivered a speech condemning mr @entity12 ’s murder but was on the golf course minutes later			0
some have criticised his 16 - day holiday – and his fondness for playing golf – at a time of world crisis			2
president @entity43 makes a statement about the execution of @entity14 journalist @entity12 by @entity68 terrorists in @entity3 in @entity151 , @entity154 , yesterday			2

@entity171 insisted he would continue to *monitor* the developing crisis in @entity3
