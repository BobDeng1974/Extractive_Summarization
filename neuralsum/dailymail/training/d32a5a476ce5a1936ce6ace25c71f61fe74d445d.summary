by @entity0 he chose to look after his mother during her final years rather than place her in the unfamiliar surroundings of a care home			1
@entity4 adapted her house , spending thousands of pounds on it so she could retain her independence			0
but yesterday the celebrity magician vented his fury at discovering he faces being penalised by the taxman for doing so			1
family : celebrity magician @entity4 , pictured with his parents @entity13 and @entity14 in 1986 , is furious after discovering he will have to pay £ 136,000 in capital gains tax when he sells his mother 's house , following her death tax bill : mr @entity4 and his wife @entity20 live in a stunning £ 2.5million home on the banks of the @entity23 in @entity24			1
but because his mother @entity13 's home was registered in his name , he faces the tax bill in the wake of her death			1
mr @entity4 said he has saved the government money , caring for his mother in her own home rather than move her to a care home he says he is facing a capital gains tax bill of £ 136,000 when he sells his late mother ’s home			1
as it was registered in @entity4 ’s name and not his mother ’s , he is liable to pay the tax on it as a ‘ second home ’			2
but he says that by caring for his mother himself he has saved the government thousands of pounds – and the essential renovations to the house should be tax deductible			2
‘ they do n’t understand the amount i ’ve spent and saved the government by providing for her , ’ he said			2
shortly after his father @entity14 died , @entity4 decided to help his mother @entity13 to remain in the house she lived in close to him and his wife and stage assistant @entity20			1
the entertainer renovated the bungalow by putting in wall banisters and adapting the bathroom			0
but following his mother ’s death in january at the age of 97 , he has calculated that he will now have to pay £ 136,000 in capital gains tax when he sells the property			1
@entity4 , 75 , who lives in a £ 2.5million mansion in @entity24 , said yesterday : ‘ my parents moved into a lodge house at our previous property and when we decided to move , i bought my mother a small bungalow in the same village as she wanted to stay			2
anger : the celebrity magician said : ' people will say " well you 've made a lot of money on the house over the years , why not pay the tax bill " , but they do n't understand the amount i 've spent and saved the government by providing for her ' ‘ i did it to take away the need for her to worry about all the niggly things that put stress on to pensioners			1
without me providing for her , my mother would have had to go into a care home paid for by the state			0
’ he told how he had to adapt the property to allow his elderly mother to live there as comfortably as possible			0
‘ i have spent thousands on the property to allow her to remain in the home she knew , ’ he said			0
‘ there were so many bars on the wall to help her cling to while she walked that we joked she could practise her ballet in the house			0
' people will say “ well you ’ve made a lot of money on the house over the years , why not pay the tax bill ” , but they do n’t understand the amount i ’ve spent and saved the government by providing for her			1
’ the bungalow in @entity113 , @entity114 , was bought by @entity4 under his real first - name of @entity116 , for £ 150,000 in 1997			0
property estimates for the area now value it at around £ 520,000			0
so wrong : @entity4 ( centre ) pictured with his parents , added : ' i will be handing over about £ 136,000 in tax			0
that feels so wrong ' @entity4 wrote on his blog : ‘ in any business you are allowed to claim expenses against tax			0
apparently not in the case of capital gains tax			1
‘ at a first glance calculation , having saved the government a small fortune by looking after my mother at my own expense , which by the way , i have never regretted or minded in any way , i will be handing over about £ 136,000 in tax			2
’ the @entity139 wanted to raise capital gains tax from 18 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent to match income rates in 2010			1
but when faced with a revolt from his backbenchers , prime minister @entity142 watered down the proposals to 28 per cent for those earning above the basic income rate			0
the government currently has no plans to change the rules of capital gains tax			1
during the recent floods @entity4 told how he was able to keep his home on the banks of the @entity23 dry , despite the waters coming close to his property			2
the house was damaged both in 2003 and 2012 , but thanks to a series of flood pumps and defences it was protected from the deluge this time .			0

celebrity magician vented his fury at discovering the tax bill
the 75 - year - old cared for his mother @entity13 during her final years at home
