but 50 - year - old @entity1 is , as of yesterday , the new prime minister of the @entity3 opposition @entity15			1
and now the @entity3 - born it executive who follows the @entity17 has lofty ambitions : to bring stability and peace to the wartorn homeland he left as a teenager			1

the bespectacled father of four was chosen to run the opposition coalition , the main political grouping opposing president @entity6 , in an election held in @entity39 , where he has been living , yesterday			1
the coalition was formed with @entity41 and @entity42 backing in @entity43 last year to bring together @entity6 's political foes and build an alternative government structure to replace his rule			2
but after a brief period of harmony , divisions have racked the group , with its liberal minority accusing the powerful @entity52 and its allies , who include a handful of @entity56 , of assuming control of the coalition			0
after a meeting in @entity61 yesterday , the coalition chose mr @entity1 , the @entity41 - educated exile who is little known in @entity3 , as provisional prime minister			1
he was elected with 35 out of 48 votes			0
mr @entity1 was backed by the @entity52 and opposition coalition secretary general @entity67 , who has strong links with @entity42 , according to sources at the meeting			2
