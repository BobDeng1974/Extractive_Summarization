by @entity0 legal battle : @entity2 , 32 , took @entity3 to court after he failed the final year of his medicine degree by one mark a medical student who took his university to the @entity9 after he failed his degree by one mark is now facing a £ 90,000 legal bill after he lost the case			1
aspiring doctor @entity2 , 32 , was locked in a bitter legal battle with @entity3 after he failed the final year of his @entity15 degree			1
his legal team claimed education chiefs had breached their contract by failing to take an average of his marks which would have seen him pass the final year of his degree at the second attempt			1
but now he could be held liable for a legal bill totalling £ 90,000 after his case was thrown out by the @entity27 's top judges			1
last night mr @entity2 's barrister , @entity28 , said his client had originally been granted a judicial review after judges sympathised with mr @entity2 's claim that academics had failed to properly mark his work			2
in a statement he said : ' it is an unfortunate outcome for a young man who had spent six years training to be a doctor and at one time or another passed every element in the medical examinations			0
' mr @entity2 , who is originally from @entity43 , @entity44 , but now lives in @entity45 , began his studies on @entity47 in october 2005 and completed the first four stages of his degree with no problems			2
but in 2010 he failed the final year and was forced to re-sit the year			1
in october 2011 he was awarded a b grade , which is a borderline fail , in the ' @entity54 ' domain and was once again told he had failed			0
instead of making alternative life plans , the talented sportsman - who was a member of the university 's basketball and hockey team - opted to launch legal action against the university and was granted a judicial review in the @entity27 's top court			0
mr @entity2 - whose brother @entity64 became one of the first @entity27 players to join an @entity67 in the @entity68 in 2012 - made a string of appeals internally and to the @entity71			0
study : mr @entity2 failed the final year of his @entity15 degree by a single mark at @entity3 - pictured he was told he could not complete his registration with the @entity76 because he had not obtained the correct grades			1
deputy high court judge @entity78 upheld @entity3 's denial they had strayed from the marking procedures in its published handbook			0
a @entity3 spokesman declined to comment until the conclusion of a hearing to determine costs which is due to take place later this month			0
mr @entity88 said : ' the judge found that the university had failed to give mr @entity2 a fair hearing under its own internal appeals procedure , the rules of which it had broken			1
' however , the ultimately critical question was whether the university had departed from its own published handbook in the manner in which it computed mr @entity2 's marks			2
' at an earlier hearing a different judge was sympathetic to mr @entity2 's argument that double weighting one of the components of a practical exam was inconsistent with the calculation of an average			0
' however , at this hearing the judge held that the handbook gave merely an overview , and that the double weighting was not inconsistent with its text			0
