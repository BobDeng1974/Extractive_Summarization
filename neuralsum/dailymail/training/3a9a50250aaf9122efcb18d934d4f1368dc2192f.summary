@entity0 yesterday said the government must raise taxes for the better off as he rounded on @entity3 plans to clear the deficit by cutting welfare and public spending			1
setting out his red lines for any future coalition deal with the @entity3 , mr @entity0 accused @entity9 and @entity10 of ‘ beating up on the poor ’ and said he would insist on a raft of new taxes to help pay off the deficit			1
as the party gathered in @entity15 for its annual conference , @entity0 leader mr @entity0 said he wanted about 20 per cent of future deficit reduction to come from tax rises on the better off			1
he also accused the @entity3 of ‘ trashing human rights ’ to pander to @entity20 , and that he would never accept mr @entity9 ’s plan to sideline the @entity22			1
while senior @entity0 insist they will not pull out of the @entity27 , they are now focused on highlighting differences with the @entity3 in a desperate bid to spark a revival in their support			1
the prime minister and @entity44 said last week that a further £ 25billion in cuts would be found after the election , with £ 3billion coming from a freeze on benefits			2
the @entity3 also announced plans to cut the benefits cap – the maximum amount any household can receive in welfare – from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000			1
mr @entity0 yesterday said that he opposed both moves and would instead demand tax rises on the rich and the middle classes as the price for any new coalition deal			1
he said the case had not been made for ‘ ratcheting down ’ the welfare cap			0
the deputy prime minister accused his coalition partners of being ‘ economically extreme ’			2
asked if the @entity0 would increase taxes to help fill the hole in the public finances , he said : ‘ yes , of course			2
’ the deputy pm insisted the public wanted the @entity0 to ' anchor ' the @entity3 in the ' centre ground ' one senior @entity0 voiced dismay at the intervention , saying : ‘ i ’m not sure we want the headline from our conference to be : vote for us and we ’ll raise your taxes			1
’ but mr @entity0 said voters should be clear about where the burden of tackling the huge budget deficit left by @entity81 would fall			1
he said @entity0 plans would include ending tax relief on pensions for the better off and scrapping benefits such as the winter fuel allowance , free bus passes and free tv licences for wealthier pensioners			2
and he confirmed the party was changing its original plans for a mansion tax , even referring to the flagship policy at one point as the ‘ so - called mansion tax ’			0
aides said the policy , on which the party fought the last election , was now known internally as the ‘ revaluation of high value properties with additional council tax bands ’			0
the mansion tax began life as a proposal to put a 1 per cent annual levy on the value of all homes above £ 2million			0
but the policy was changed this year under pressure from the party ’s @entity111			0
it was replaced with plans for new council tax bands on properties above that value			0
the @entity0 say the policy will raise £ 1.5billion , but have yet to set out how it will work			2
yesterday @entity120 , the @entity0 chief secretary to the treasury , called for the introduction of a ‘ fairness rule ’ until the deficit was paid off			2
he said it would ensure the ‘ best off ’ have contributed the biggest share of their income to help pay down the deficit			0
in an interview on the @entity132 ’s @entity131 , mr @entity0 accused the conservatives of announcing with ‘ almost undisguised relish ’ that they would not ask the wealthiest to pay a ‘ single penny towards completing the deficit reduction effort ’			1
he added : ‘ what we are saying is that those choices , either sticking your head in the sand or beating up on the poor , are not the choices the @entity33 people want			0
they want balance between a strong economy and a fairer society , and that is what we are offering			0
’ asked why the @entity0 remained in government with a party they despised , he replied : ‘ we have restrained the conservatives from doing what they want on penalising the poor , on ignoring the environment , on trashing our civil liberties and human rights			0
’ the @entity0 conference in @entity15 – the last before the election – comes against the backdrop of dismal poll ratings that has seen its support fall to just 6 per cent			0
mr @entity0 yesterday appeared to concede that the @entity0 were ceasing to be a national party , saying : ‘ i accept that , we ’re not fighting as forcefully in some parts of the country as others			1
’ senior @entity0 dems are also furious that last week the @entity3 copied their plan to raise the starting threshold for income tax to £ 12,500 if they win the next election			1
they will try to wrest back the initiative later this week by announcing they will go further by raising the threshold for @entity179 .			0

deputy pm says he will not allow deficit to be eliminated by cuts alone
attacks ' economically *illiterate* ' proposals by the @entity3 not to raise taxes
says 20 *%* of the @entity33 *'s* £ *105billion* deficit should be cleared by tax rises
comes after @entity9 vowed to slash taxes for *30* million workers
but @entity10 said welfare would have to be cut by £ *12billion*
mr @entity0 also vows to stop @entity33 leaving @entity22
he said staying in convention was a ' red line ' for future @entity27 *negotiation*
