by @entity0 published : 19:45 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 02:54 est , 5 december 2012 decisions , decisions : @entity2 pictured with a friend 's pram in june this will be the most scrutinised , most photographed , most copied pregnancy the world has ever seen			1
in this celebrity - obsessed , internet age , it is certain that every decision mother - to - be @entity2 makes until her baby ’s birth will prove to be a trend - setting one — analysed and imitated across the globe			1
her bump itself will become the focus of attention for a gawping world as people look for scintillas of cheer among stories of economic austerity and international sabre - rattling			1
indeed , the little prince or princess will have considerable influence even before they take their first breath in the land over which they ’ll one day reign			2
long gone are the days when well - heeled women chose to hide during their so - called ‘ confinement ’			2
when @entity2 married into the @entity37 , she accepted that her every move would be forensically watched			1
as such , she will doubtless be cast in the leading role as @entity40 of the @entity41			2
@entity42 can therefore hardly resort to the occasional slummy day like most mothers - to - be — wearing a ‘ tent - dress ’ to cover a growing tummy , or pulling on a size 14 jumper over maternity jeans			0
in any case , the figure of the naturally svelte @entity2 will for some months be considerably slimmer than the average woman ’s , so she wo n’t have to wear maternity clothes for a good while			1
when she does want to adapt her wardrobe , she can conveniently turn to @entity54 of @entity55 — her wedding dress designer who is due to have a baby in february			1
if anyone can make fashionable coats and dresses with a tactfully high waistline , it is her			0
but more thorny issues will eventually arise — for no one ’s decisions are more contentious than a pregnant mother ’s			0
natural birth ( probably ) or @entity69 ? home ( highly unlikely ) or hospital ? @entity72 and @entity73 were born in the @entity74 at @entity75 ’s in @entity76 , @entity77			1
@entity2 is expected to follow suit by using the private wing of an @entity81 hospital , and the @entity82 has just been refurbished			1
the private @entity83 in central @entity77 is the celebrity favourite but does n’t have the adult intensive - care facilities of a large teaching hospital			0
no risks , however tiny , are going to be taken here			0
once the birthing suite has been chosen and @entity2 has a few months on her hands , there will be plenty of other choices to make concerning the care of the newest heir to the throne			1
the royal nursery at @entity97 , @entity98 , is probably being refurbished at this moment — overseen by @entity2			1
among the apartment ’s 20 rooms , which once saw late - night louche parties hosted by @entity104 , there is plenty of room for live - in maternity nurses and nannies			0
these might play a less central role than they once did in royal circles , as hands - on parenting will be @entity2 ’s goal , but they will still be on call			1
they will perhaps be vetted by the upmarket firm @entity119 , which charges a finder ’s fee of £ 2,500 , but ideally will come with word - of - mouth recommendations			0
@entity72 and @entity2 could talk to soon - to - be near neighbours @entity122 and @entity124			1
he is a financial consultant , and their daughter @entity126 was a bridesmaid at @entity72 and @entity2 ’s wedding			1
@entity124 had a third child in january			0
or they could consult the @entity132 ’s children , @entity133 and @entity134 , who both have children and live in @entity77			0
then there is the question of a @entity139 name , and several middle names , for the future monarch			0
if it ’s a girl , will @entity142 be in there somewhere ? or @entity146 ? the chosen moniker will spawn endless imitators , while the @entity149 will be a national event			1
@entity72 was christened by the @entity151 in the @entity152 at @entity153 , and we can expect something similar this time			0
two tiers of @entity158 ’s wedding cake from 2011 are waiting			0
the role of godparent will be hotly contested			0
the couple will probably choose five or six from three groups : royal relations , trustworthy @entity165 friends and media - savvy celeb types			1
the obvious choices are , of course , that glamorous pair @entity170 — no one can plan the infant ’s parties better , and do n’t forget the @entity174 range from her parents ’ firm @entity175 — and @entity73 , the racy uncle incarnate			2
farther removed but still in the royal running could be a @entity179 relation , such as @entity142 ’s brother @entity181 ’s blonde daughter @entity180 , or @entity182 or @entity183			2
from the second group , there ’s @entity186 or his three brothers — long - time pals of @entity188 and @entity73 — who are all tall , handsome and reliable			0
there are the @entity191 - @entity190 — @entity192 - winning jockey and dental entrepreneur @entity193 and his wife @entity195 — and @entity196 , @entity72 ’s lively surveyor friend from @entity198 prep school who is engaged to aristocratic tennis coach @entity200			2
family : who will @entity2 choose to be godparents to the baby ? sister @entity170 and brother - in - law @entity73 are likely to be in the running this tweedy lot can lay down fine wine and polish up the guns for the royal youngster ’s first shoot			1
but if the @entity213 want a ‘ fun ’ choice , they might ask nightclub owner @entity215 or @entity217 ’s daughter @entity216 , who would ensure a lifetime of discreet holidays at her father ’s retreats in @entity223 and on @entity224			0
in the meantime , there will be no more desirable product placement than on this celebrity royal baby			1
by @entity230 or not , firms will be queueing up to send their cashmere outfits , sheepskin - lined papooses and eco-friendly baby bottles to @entity98 , in the hope they may be photographed with the royal tot — sparking a sell - out in the process			1
so what will catch @entity2 ’s eye as she flicks through the catalogues ? a @entity77 baby ca n’t show its face without a @entity245 pram , starting at more than £ 700			1
and if any baby should have a top - of - the - range version , with alloy wheels and ‘ sports - car fabric ’ designed by @entity251 ( at £ 1,250 ) , surely it ’s this one			2
that said , it would be a shame if the infant did not also have a traditional @entity257 ‘ @entity258 ’ pram ( yours for a mere £ 1,450 ) — the type @entity181 was wheeled around in by his nanny — for strolls in @entity263			2
@entity264 : the @entity266 store in @entity267 will be handy for @entity2 to pick up healthy food for her baby here , @entity2 could participate in organised buggy walks ( to keep you fit ) , or she could go to @entity272 for @entity273 — music and play			1
the vast @entity275 retailer @entity266 in @entity267 sells all manner of organic baby food , chlorine - free baby wipes and socially acceptable snacks , such as organic rice cakes			2
minutes from @entity98 , this is the mothership of organic health - food shops — where else for baby ’s first mango mash ? one of the defining issues for the @entity287 and @entity42 will be where to send @entity289 to school			1
@entity77 mothers will be talking of little else for years to come — local applications will spike on the merest rumour			0
nurseries and schools will be deciding whether to gently suggest a visit or to wait for the @entity98 to call			0
nurseries within walking distance of @entity98 are the minors in @entity300 — @entity72 went to the original establishment in @entity302 , then called the @entity303 — and @entity304 , a long - established safe haunt of the @entity307 upper classes			0
there is the celebrity - friendly @entity309 in @entity310 but it is a bit further away and may be a little glitzy for the @entity213			0
education : if it 's a boy will @entity2 send her baby to @entity72 's old school @entity318 , @entity77 ? then , after two years in a gingham smock , infant @entity319 will have a choice of prep schools to scoot to			1
for single - sex , there is @entity72 ’s old school , @entity318 in @entity327 ( much more academic now than it ever was in @entity72 ’s day ) and its sister school for girls , @entity330			2
both are familiar paparazzi territory : the school runs have featured @entity334 , @entity335 and @entity336			2
their children have now moved on but the @entity338 went on a tour last week			0
after drop - off , the mothers who do n’t work pile into the coffee shops on @entity343 , where they discuss each other			0
the gilded educational establishments their children attend require application at birth , but @entity72 and @entity2 could shock us all and go for a state school such as @entity352 ’s , a @entity354 primary that is probably the closest school to @entity98 and attended by the children of @entity357 and @entity358			1
depending on your viewpoint , sending a @entity319 there would be admirably unsnobby or the taking up of a place by someone whose family could easily afford to opt out of the state system			0
forget @entity367 ’s @entity366 and manufacturing - output figures			0
buggy makers , private schools , and bootee pedlars are all hoping that @entity372 might give the @entity307 economy the boost it so badly needs .			0

@entity2 's bump itself will become the focus of worldwide attention but what of her choices after the baby is born ?
@entity0 *speculates* as to what pram , toys and school the royal baby could have chosen for him or her
