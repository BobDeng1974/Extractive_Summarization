by @entity0 they seem a most unlikely opening partnership but former @entity4 batsman @entity3 was pictured with @entity6 pop star @entity5 on wednesday - and predictably he played it with a straight bat			1
while boycott is often critical of another @entity9 , @entity9 , he has nothing but praise for the singer , with whom he has a long - standing affinity			1
the @entity14 acknowledged that he was a fan of @entity15 while on the @entity17 's @entity16 two years ago			1
all smiles : @entity3 is a massive fan of popstar @entity5 and the pair finally met up this week her biggest fan ? @entity3 said he really enjoyed @entity15 's music but admitted he never thought they 'd meet happy @entity23 : @entity15 is renowned for being a @entity25 fan but is catching the eye in the cricket world ' i like that @entity5 , ' he said			1
' she 's a good singer			2
' she 's nice , her			0
she 's tops for me			0
she just has something about her voice - it 's good and strong			2
' i do n't think i 'll ever meet her			2
' @entity36 's former wife @entity15 then urged @entity3 to show her the ' @entity14 countryside ' in august			1
' @entity39 , it 's @entity5			0
i just think you 're beautiful and your style is stunning , ' she said in a message on the @entity17			0
show me around ! @entity15 said in august that she wanted a tour of the @entity14 countryside ' when i 'm next in the @entity45 you 'll have to show me around the @entity14 countryside			0
' and @entity3 's dream came true this week when the pair met up			1
whether it beat scoring his hundredth hundred during an @entity50 at @entity51 is another matter , but meeting @entity15 certainly seemed to hit him for six ... joining the immortals : boycott drives the ball down the ground to bring up his hundredth 100 in 1977			0
