putting a minimum price of alcohol is illegal , the @entity0 has warned @entity3			2
the nine - page letter from @entity5 to the prime minister says the scheme would break laws governing the free movement of goods			1
the @entity12 proposal is to ban the sale of alcohol for less than 45p per unit in an effort to target heavy drinkers			2
' turn back ' : the @entity0 warned @entity3 that minimum pricing contravenes laws governing the free movement of goods it will mean that wine can not be sold for less than about £ 4.05 a bottle , beer will be at least 90p a can and a stand - size bottle of vodka will cost at least £ 11.70			1
the average family drinks bill will soar by almost £ 100 a year under the government ’s plan for minimum pricing for alcohol , it was revealed last night			1
in the leaked letter , the @entity0 advised the @entity36 to increase duty on alcoholic drinks if it wishes to raise the price , the @entity34 @entity33 revealed			0
the government appears to be ignoring the legal warning , however , and is forging ahead with the plan , claiming it will save hundreds of lives and millions of pounds of public money each year by cutting crime and health problems linked to binge drinking			1
wine - producing nations such as @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 are planning to take @entity52 to court for breaching the @entity55 law on free trade			1
research has found that 59 per cent of all alcoholic units sold in off - licences and supermarkets cost less than 45p per unit – meaning their price will go up			1
increase : an average family 's drinks bill will rise by almost £ 100 if @entity40 plans to increase the minimum price of alcohol a couple who drink the average amount will see their annual grocery bill rise by around £ 94 a year			1
the finding by the respected @entity72 ( @entity72 ) is a blow for the government ’s claim that the plan will target only binge drinkers			2
@entity79 officials have already written to @entity80 , the @entity34 first minister , to warn that @entity34 ’s 50p minimum price plan may contravene @entity55 rules			1
the @entity40 had gone to court to keep the embarrassing letter to mr @entity80 secret - now it emerges that they have had one of their own			2
@entity88 , of the @entity0 , explained that supermarkets would simply sell more alcohol to boost profits , and she said the plan would create ‘ market distortions ’			0
miss day said : ‘ the @entity52 authorities are invited to abstain from adopting the draft legislation at issue			0
’ the government believes imposing a 45p minimum unit price will reduce total alcohol consumption by 3.3 per cent , and cut the number of crimes by 5,000 per year and hospital admissions by 24,000			1
there will be 700 fewer alcohol - linked deaths annually , according to the predictions			0
however , the @entity72 said that while ministers are right to say the heaviest drinkers will be the most affected by price rises , there will also be an impact on moderate drinkers			0
those who drink less than seven units a week will see grocery bills rise , because 48 per cent of the units they buy tend to be less than 45p			2
the @entity72 research also found that one of the drinks most associated with binge drinking - alcopops - will hardly be affected by the minimum price at all , because it almost always costs more than 45p a unit anyway			1
clash of opinion : @entity12 minister @entity127 , right , said cheap alcohol contributes to ' harmful levels of drinking ' while @entity88 , left , of the @entity0 , said the plan would create ' market distortions ' in contrast , 72 per cent of the units in lager sold in shops , 70 per cent of the units in spirits and 46 per cent of units in table wine cost less than 45p and will therefore be affected			1
they found that if no one changes their habits in response to the price rises , the minimum price will simply transfer £ 1.4billion from consumers to off - licences and supermarkets			2
@entity151 , of the wine and @entity153 , said : ‘ minimum unit pricing and the proposed restrictions to promotions are wholly untargeted and will unfairly punish millions of consumers and businesses in the @entity52 , while doing nothing to tackle the root causes of alcohol misuse or associated crime and disorder			1
‘ alcohol misuse is a serious and complex problem for a small number of people in this country			0
’ the report confirms that low - income families will see the largest increases in prices , because they are most likely to buy cheap alcohol			0
and they say there is no evidence the plan will actually reduce harmful drinking			0
‘ the most important issue in determining the impact of minimum pricing will be whether those who generate the greatest social harms from their consumption drink less as a result of the policy , ’ the report said			0
‘ that will depend on how well targeted on those drinkers a minimum price is , and how their consumption responds to price rises - something we know relatively little about			0
’ @entity12 minister @entity127 told @entity193 ’s today programme : ‘ the evidence is clear - the availability of cheap alcohol contributes to harmful levels of drinking			2
it ca n’t be right that it is possible to purchase a can of beer for as little as 20p			0
‘ too many of us have seen city centres on a friday and saturday night often become a vision of hell			0
a lot of this is fuelled by very cheap , very strong alcohol			0
