tragic : five - month - old @entity0 died on june 4 2010 , hours after his mother phoned for help a baby died from meningitis after the on - call doctor asked to examine him failed to turn up and instead left his worried parents a phone message to say he was ‘ very busy ’ , an inquest heard			1
@entity0 ’s mother had rung @entity10 after the five - month - old boy was taken ill overnight with a high temperature and heavy breathing			1
a call handler from the privately run @entity17 - @entity16 scheme passed the call to duty gp dr @entity19 with a message saying he needed to visit the family because they had no transport to get to hospital or money for a taxi			1
instead of instructing his driver to take him to their address , however , he left two voicemail messages on @entity0 ’s mother ’s mobile phone asking her to contact him			1
when she failed to answer , he assumed the family were asleep and that @entity0 was ok , made a ‘ likely diagnosis ’ of a viral illness and concluded that a visit was ‘ not necessary ’ , the hearing was told			1
but four hours later , @entity0 developed a tell - tale rash on his forehead , and although his parents called an ambulance he died later in hospital			1
after being challenged over what happened , dr @entity19 initially lied about having attended the house and claimed the lights were switched off when he arrived			1
he even described the street and area , claiming it was ‘ dark ’ and ‘ scruffy ’ before coming clean			0
his mother , @entity52 , now 23 , told the hearing in @entity54 that in the hours before he died in june 2010 , @entity0 had become unsettled and started making a ‘ whimpering noise ’ while out in his pram			1
back at their home in @entity59 , @entity60 , he refused food , and she and @entity0 ’s father @entity62 , 25 , a labourer , noticed a rise in his temperature			2
she gave him baby paracetamol , but he continued to struggle and was breathing heavily , although there was no sign of a rash			0
shortly before midnight she rang the @entity10 helpline , which has since been replaced by the non-emergency 111 service , and then told a health adviser from @entity72 about @entity0 ’s condition			1
miss @entity52 said @entity0 felt ‘ really , really hot , like boiling hot ’			2
his case was referred to the on - call doctor with the message in capital letters : ‘ @entity78			2
left , @entity0 's parents @entity52 and @entity62 @entity0 ’s exhausted parents then fell asleep , and when miss @entity52 woke up four hours later she realised she had two voicemails			1
‘ @entity0 was beside me and i saw a purple rash on his forehead , ’ she said			2
‘ i got a glass and put it on the rash because i knew it was meningitis			0
’ symptoms : @entity0 , pictured , had been suffering a high temperature and heavy breathing her partner called an ambulance but @entity0 died later that day at @entity99			1
his family has since received an apology from @entity17 - @entity16 dr @entity19 , 47 , from @entity103 , @entity104 , was later suspended for 12 months for misconduct by the @entity106			1
his first voicemail message said : ‘ we are very busy with visits			0
maybe he can wait until the morning			0
’ the second said : ‘ as you have n’t called back i ’m assuming that your son @entity0 is doing ok and settled down			2
i would suggest a follow - up with your gp some time during open hours			2
however , i would like you to phone us back with any concerns			0
’ dr @entity19 said that at the time he had been working an ‘ excessive number of shifts ’ , including six that required him to cover if a doctor rang in sick as well as seven days at his surgery in @entity121 and five overnight shifts lasting from 11pm to 7am			1
when asked if he had been ‘ too busy ’ to see @entity0 , he said : ‘ i do n’t know the reason i did n’t visit			2
i had the four visits come in at once			0
‘ i felt with no call back , i just assumed that everything was fine and settled			0
i should have attended but i was under a considerable amount of stress at the time			0
i admit working an excessive number of hours			0
meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection , but they are not yet available for all forms			0
so it 's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia			0
symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia : other signs in babies : septicaemia can occur with or without meningitis			0
not everyone gets all the symptoms and they can appear in any order			0
