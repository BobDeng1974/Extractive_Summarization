@entity2 admitted that 43 - year - old @entity32 , one half of band @entity41 with @entity42 , ' likes me when i 'm a rock ' n ' roll kind of girl '			1
@entity2 certainly has the credentials - having dated wayward @entity48 star @entity47 and found notoriety for her reported wild partying			2
revealing : the 38 - year - old mother refuses to tone down her outfits , heading out on the town last night in a clinging dress that left little to the imagination she has frequently been the subject of controversy - particularly since many have claimed her drinking , smoking and late nights have begun to ravage her looks - but her laidback attitude suggests she does not care			2

the @entity100 - born star says that her worst wardrobe malfunctions involve forgetting to do up zips - and indeed she was seen out in @entity35 leaving @entity104 restaurant @entity105 last month with her flies undone			0
although she says she ' loves ' people trying out the looks she has designed for @entity85 and copying her style , she says her one piece of fashion advice to the @entity9 public would be to be aware of exposing too much in the summertime			0
she said : ' when you 're driving down the road in the summer , the @entity15 people ... ' it 's not our natural thing , no. so it 's " put it awaaaaaay ! "			0
