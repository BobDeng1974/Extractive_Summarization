by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity3 @entity2 has been accused of fuelling the same ‘ distrust ’ of foreigners which swept @entity7 before the outbreak of @entity9			1
liberal democrat lord @entity10 sparked a major row with @entity2 leader @entity12 with a warning against blaming ‘ foreigner scapegoats for our economic troubles ’			1
the peer made the provocative remarks during a @entity20 debate on how best to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity9			1
war of words : @entity25 lord @entity10 questioned how much @entity2 's @entity12 knew about the @entity9 , but it emerged mr @entity12 runs his own tours of battlefields the peer claimed mr @entity12 would ‘ do well to revisit the history of that period ’ to learn that ‘ fomenting distrust can so easily lead to hatred ’			1
however , it emerged mr @entity12 runs regular tours of @entity9 battlefields and he said his opposition to the @entity36 was in part informed by the way the collapse of the single currency had fuelled ' hatred ' between eurozone countries			1
as part of national commemorations next year , 100 years on from the start of the conflict , children from every state secondary school will travel to the battlefields as part of a £ 50million package of events			1
@entity53 has said @entity3 had a duty to ‘ honour those who served , remember those who died and ensure the lessons learnt live with us forever ’			0
but lord @entity10 , a former mp for @entity59 , said the tone of the events must reflect how the sacrifice of millions ‘ did not achieve the war to end all wars that they thought they were fighting for ’			1
the criticism of mr @entity12 appeared to backfire after it emerged the @entity2 leader conducts tours of @entity9 battlefields every year lord @entity10 said his three uncles died in the conflict which was ' largely pointless , meaningless and avoidable '			1
he went on : ' we should not be celebrating its absurd origins , however much we may pay tribute to those who fought , were wounded or lost their lives			0
‘ instead , we must remind ourselves of the futility of negative nationalism , so sharply distinct from positive patriotism			0
’ he then went on to appear to draw parallels between the rise of @entity2 based on attacking ' foreigner scapegoats ' and the spread of nationalism across continental @entity7 before 1914			1
more than a million @entity3 died in the @entity9			2
the @entity86 was one of the most deadly in the four year conflict			0
here a party of @entity90 is pictured in a communication trench on the first day of the @entity86 personal accounts of life on the frontline are likely to feature heavily in next year 's commemorations , most notably from the @entity86 , the bloodiest day in the history of the @entity3 army the @entity9 was sparked by the assassination of @entity100 archduke @entity99 by a @entity101 during a visit to @entity103 on june 28 1914			1
as the two countries clashed , their allies lined up in support with @entity108 backing @entity100 , with @entity109 , @entity3 and @entity110 sympathising with @entity101			2
a period of of grand - standing , abortive talks and partial mobilisation of troops culminated in @entity116 declaring war on @entity101 on july 28			0
@entity108 declared war on @entity109 on august 1 and then @entity110 on august 3 , demanding free passage through @entity120 , which lead @entity3 to declare war on @entity108			2
on august 6 @entity116 declared war on @entity109 and within weeks @entity122 had also entered the conflict			0
@entity53 unveiled plans to for the commemorations for the 100th anniversary of the start of the @entity9 at the @entity128 in @entity129 lord @entity10 said the catalogue of events in 1914 marked ' a terrible failure of common sense and common humanity '			1
he told peers : ' i will find it difficult to mark the centenary of the war 's outbreak with anything other than a resolve that we should do all we can to reconcile the peoples of @entity7 in the 21st century , avoiding new foreigner scapegoats for our economic troubles , and perhaps also reminding ourselves of the 1914 warmongering populism of the @entity3 press , which seems familiar			1
' ‘ i do not know where mr @entity12 's ancestors were between 1914 and 1918 , but he would do well to revisit the history of that period			2
fomenting distrust can so easily lead to hatred			0
’ the remarks come just days after @entity2 ran the @entity25 a close second in the hotly - contested @entity157 by - election , as all the main parties wrestle with how to respond to the rise of the @entity162 party			2
lord @entity10 told @entity1 today : ‘ making a scapegoat of other peoples for problems which are closer to home is extremely dangerous			1
‘ clearly [ @entity2 ] are more serious players than they were so they have got to watch how they approach these issues			2
’ however , mr @entity12 told @entity1 the criticism was ‘ totally absurd ’			0
twice a year he leads tours of @entity9 battlefields , with groups of friends , colleagues and visiting politicians whom he labels ‘ @entity176 ’			1
‘ i know a lot about the @entity9 and its origins and i know that in the wake of it we formed something called @entity183 to stop @entity185 conflicts and look where that got us			0
‘ it is totally absurd , and i would invite lord @entity10 to go and visit @entity189 and see real hatred			1
they now hate the @entity108 more than at any time since 1945			2
‘ i want us to have a @entity7 of independent nation states that trade and co-operate together			0
‘ but if you force people together against their will , history tells us the long - term outcome will be deeply , deeply unpleasant			0
' you breed extreme nationalism			0
lord @entity10 is 50 years out of date with his analysis of what @entity7 is			1
’ commemorations marking the centenary of the @entity9 will last five years and cost £ 50million			1
they will include : £ 5.3million to allow children and teachers from every secondary school to visit battlefields such as the @entity86 , @entity210 and @entity211			0
national commemorations on august 4 , 2014 , to recall the first day of the conflict ; on july 1 , 2016,to remember the first day of the @entity86 ; and in 2018 to mark the centenary of @entity215			2
£ 15million in grants from the @entity217 to support events across the country			0
ideas include friendly football matches to mark the 1914 christmas day truce on the @entity223			0
a £ 5million contribution to the £ 35million redevelopment of the @entity128 ’s @entity9 galleries			0
a £ 1million grant to secure the future in @entity229 of @entity230 , @entity9 ’s last surviving warship			0
visit by @entity53 and @entity233 taoiseach @entity232 to the @entity120 battlefields where 27,000 irishmen in the @entity3 forces died .			0

warns against blaming ' foreigner scapegoats for our economic troubles '
but @entity2 leader @entity12 leads tours of @entity9 battlefields and claims @entity251 ' hatred ' of @entity108 over @entity253 crisis is *highest* since 1945
