@entity0 and @entity1 handed @entity2 a 2 - 0 win away in @entity4 , but it was n't enough as @entity7 's side crashed out of the @entity8			1
@entity9 striker @entity0 struck in the first half to give travelling @entity2 fans a glimmer of hope at the @entity14 before @entity1 grabbed a second			1
however , a resilient @entity4 defence refused to let in another and the @entity9 side progressed to the next round on the away goals rule			1
@entity22 's @entity21 was at the game to give the lowdown in @entity9 ... @entity2 @entity25 6 so little to do , the @entity26 effectively took the evening off for much of the game			1
@entity28 5.5 loves to get forward , ca n’t be faulted in his running			2
but still partial to panicky moments in his own penalty area			0
@entity4 's @entity34 midfielder @entity33 vies with @entity2 's midfielder @entity35 per mertesacker 6 in control , assured			1
a different player altogether to the man who fell apart in the first leg			0
@entity40 6.5 almost opened the scoring with a prod on to the bat from very close range			0
had less to do at the back			0
@entity46 5.5 pushed on , got forward , but his delivery on the cross lets him down at times and was exposed at times			0
@entity35 6.5 taking his enforcer role to heart			0
twice he crunched @entity33 in half in the first half but avoided a yellow card			2
@entity56 midfielder @entity55 attempts a special effort during the @entity8 @entity55 6.5 adequate but not quite the little magician that you were expecting given that he has been @entity2 ’s best player of late			1
@entity61 5.5 strangely lackadaisical in his passing which almost let in @entity4 in the eighth minute			1
booked – harshly – for a dive			0
his energy was impressive as ever			0
@entity68 7 never stopped trying to create , always looking for the killer pass – had an extremely organised @entity4 midfield with which he had to contend			1
@entity2 's @entity73 defender per @entity74 vies with @entity4 's @entity9 defender @entity75 @entity76 7 a veritable bundle of energy , driving into the @entity4 penalty area			1
his pass set up @entity0 ’s goal			1
came off on 71 minutes as influence faded			0
@entity0 7.5 really excellent finish to open the scoring			2
his reaction and poise once the ball bounced off his head was superb			0
redemptive after the first game			0
subs @entity1 ( for @entity35 62 ) 7 - @entity94 reaction and finish when @entity75 inexplicably gave the ball to him on 79 minutes			2
@entity97 ( for @entity76 72 ) 6 @entity98 ( for @entity99 82 ) 6 @entity4 defender @entity100 vies with @entity9 striker @entity0 during the match at @entity103 stadium manager @entity7 7 game plan was assured , defence was solid and they gave themselves the chance			1
it did beg the question why they could n’t have done that in the first leg ? @entity4 @entity114 8 solid taking crosses and produced good saves , notably from @entity68 ’s second half free - kick			1
unfortunate for @entity0 ’s goal			2
@entity2 defender @entity28 vies with @entity4 's @entity9 forward @entity119 during the match @entity121 5 struggled to maintain composure at times as @entity2 poured forward			1
@entity123 6.5 was the leader at the back , forever cajoling and generally anticipating much of @entity2 ’s attacking intent			2
@entity100 6 preferred to the much more experienced @entity127 and did n’t let his side down			2
@entity75 4 looked vulnerable , especially when @entity76 switched to the right			0
dreadful error giving the ball away for the second goal			0
@entity4 's @entity134 forward @entity133 vies with @entity2 's @entity9 midfielder @entity35 @entity136 7.5 fought , tackled and ran			1
did as much anyone to secure @entity4 ’s passage to the quarters			2
@entity140 7 composed , robust , provided leadership , especially in those tricky final few minutes			0
@entity142 7.5 remained a threat even with @entity4 camped in their own half			1
@entity33 6.5 not as influential as the first leg but still fulfilled his duties and brought composure when necessary			0
@entity0 celebrates as he gives @entity2 a glimmer of hope against @entity4 at the @entity103 stadium @entity119 5 strugled to make an impact and taken of on 59 minutes			1
@entity133 7 the touches were just as exquisite as always ; did what he does and then departed after 76 minutes to make way for younger , fitter men			0
subs @entity160 ( for @entity161 ) 7 @entity162 ( for @entity133 76 ) 6 @entity142 ( for @entity163 85 ) 6 @entity2 's @entity164 ace @entity61 vies for the ball with @entity4 's @entity9 defender @entity75 manager @entity168 7.5 so they lost 2 - 0 – but over two legs @entity170 has been masterful			1
even last night his team were superbly set up			0
ref @entity173 6 perhaps harsh on booking @entity61 for diving ; otherwise avoided major controversy for the most part and refereed sensibly .			0

@entity0 fired @entity2 into the lead in the first half against @entity4
substitute @entity1 *bagged* a second as @entity2 dominated
but @entity4 *goalkeeper* @entity114 was in no mood to be beaten again
@entity9 side progressed to the next round of the @entity8
