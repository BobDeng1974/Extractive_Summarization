by @entity0 published : 13:44 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 06:37 est , 3 january 2013 around 100,000 people were struck down with norovirus over @entity4 - and cases will continue to rise , experts have warned around 100,000 people were struck down with the winter vomiting bug over @entity4 - and cases will continue to rise , experts have warned			1
figures released today show the number of confirmed cases was 72 per cent higher than this time last year			1
the dramatic rise was attributed in part to an early outbreak of the illness which closed dozens of hospital wards as it swept across the country			1
a total of 3,877 laboratory - confirmed cases of norovirus have now been recorded in @entity22 and @entity23 - up on the 2,255 of last year			1
but the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) said that for every reported case , an estimated 288 were not flagged up , meaning around 1.12 million people could now have contracted the illness this season			2
this is about 100,000 more than during the pre-christmas period - until december 23 - when 1.01 million people were estimated to have come down with the bug			2
the number of reported cases dropped slightly during the @entity4 week but this was in keeping with dips at the same time in previous seasons , the @entity24 said			1
@entity35 , an expert in norovirus from the @entity24 , said : ' as we have seen in previous years there has been a dip in the number of confirmed laboratory reports owing to the @entity4 and @entity43 period			1
' however , in line with other norovirus seasons we will expect to see an increase in the number of laboratory reports in the next few weeks			1
during the two weeks up to december 30 , there were 29 hospital outbreaks reported , compared to 70 in the previous fortnight , bringing the total for the season to 590			1
cases of norovirus shot up earlier than expected this winter across @entity54			2
but experts have been unable to determine why this is the case or predict whether numbers will continue to rise at the same rate			2
although people can suffer from norovirus at any time of the year , activity increases in the winter months			1
@entity63 is no different from other viruses that circulate at this time of year , but it is incredibly infectious			1
it is the @entity67 ’s most common cause of gastroenteritis , and spreads easily when everyone is cooped up inside during the winter			0
one problem is that people do not develop long - lasting immunity – you are protected for only a few months , so next winter you can easily get it again			0
the vomiting viruses , colds and flu tend to peak in winter partly because people congregate inside , explains dr @entity80 , director of biomedical science at @entity81			0
‘ viruses can be picked up and passed on often as a result of poor hygiene — which often means people just not washing their hands , ’ says dr @entity80			0
‘ a get - together where people are in close contact inside — for example , a concert in a closed venue , or a church carol service — is the perfect environment for viruses to spread			0
’ he adds : ‘ the problem with viruses is that in the first phase of infection there are no signs or symptoms — and this can last for days , although normally people are contagious at this stage so it can then be passed on to other people			0
’ viruses also survive longer during winter weather , thanks to the lack of sunshine and the damp weather conditions , says professor @entity116 , a virologist from @entity117			0
for norovirus , you need exposure to only a small number of virus particles — between ten and 100 — to catch the sickness compared with 10,000 particles to catch flu			2
‘ you only need to come into contact with a single droplet from a sneeze — which can contain up to a million virus particles — to become infected with a cold , ’ says professor @entity116			0
mr @entity35 added : ' @entity63 is very contagious , and anyone who has had it knows it is very unpleasant			0
' if you think you may have the illness then it is important to maintain good hand hygiene to help prevent it spreading			0
" we also advise that people stay away from hospitals , schools and care homes as these environments are particularly prone to outbreaks			2
' a @entity147 spokesman said : ' the @entity148 is well prepared for the winter			0
no a&es have had to close so far this winter and we are providing additional funding to the @entity148 to help it cope with the added pressure that the winter brings			0
' flu and norovirus are typical at this time of year - that 's why we are running the ' catch it			1
kill it ' campaign to remind people that one of the best ways to stop the spread of winter bugs is to catch it , @entity165 and kill it when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands regularly			0
' our weekly published figures show the number of beds closed across the @entity148 due to norovirus symptoms is around 2.4 per cent			1
this compares to 2.9 % of beds that were closed during the peak of norovirus cases last winter			2

figures released today show the number of confirmed cases was 72 per cent higher than this time last year
number of cases dropped slightly during the @entity4 week but is set to rise again in the coming weeks
hospital outbreaks this season rise to 590
