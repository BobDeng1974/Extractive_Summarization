@entity0 , the seventh - century ruler of @entity1 , is hardly a household name			1
but as the man who helped unite @entity4 and convert the @entity5 to @entity6 , he deserves to be much better remembered , according to one archaeologist			2
@entity0 was exiled as a young man before returning to his homeland in order to claim his birthright and become king - an adventure which apparently inspired @entity14 to create the character of @entity16 in @entity17			1
hero : the character of @entity16 in @entity17 was inspired by @entity0 , the seventh - century king of @entity1 , according to archaeologist @entity20 legacy : @entity0 was instrumental in the foundation of @entity24 monastery , whose remains still stand artist 's impression : this mid- 19th - century painting by @entity28 shows @entity0 , left , receiving homage from @entity30 , the @entity31 ; no image of the king survives from his lifetime @entity20 , a visiting fellow at @entity35 , has written a biography of @entity0 which argues that the king - later venerated across @entity38 as a saint and martyr - was a key figure in rebuilding the @entity5 state after the collapse of the @entity44			1
the book , entitled @entity0 in the @entity46 , describes how @entity47 was born into the royal house of @entity49 , a kingdom covering the territory which is now @entity52 , @entity53 and south - east @entity54			1
his father @entity55 united @entity49 with @entity56 , a territory roughly corresponding to modern @entity58 , to create the land of @entity1 - but in 616 , when @entity0 was just 12 years old , @entity55 was killed in battle , and his son was forced to flee @entity5 and take refuge in western @entity54			1
the new king of the @entity1 , @entity63 , was a distant cousin of @entity0 , but that would not have saved the young prince from the wrath of a ruler keen to eliminate potential rivals			2
treasure : the great @entity70 , now in the @entity71 , would not exist if @entity0 had not kept his vow to @entity73 to found a new religious institution stunning : the opening of @entity76 from the @entity24 manuscript , written at the @entity1 monastery less than a century after the death of @entity0 home : @entity0 was from the fortress of @entity82 , whose later replacement is pictured here family tree : @entity0 was the product of a marriage between the royal lines of @entity49 and @entity56 for nearly two decades , @entity0 grew up in the kingdom of @entity89 , an @entity91 - speaking region covering the west coast of @entity54 and part of @entity94			1
crucially for @entity4 's future , it was here - at the monastery of @entity99 , in the @entity100 - that @entity0 was converted to @entity6 , having previously followed the pagan faith of his @entity103 ancestors			1
it was also in @entity89 that the young man forged a reputation as a warrior , fighting alongside his @entity109 hosts and earning the nickname ' @entity111 ' , according to mr @entity20			0
when his uncle @entity63 was killed by a @entity114 king in 633 , @entity0 decided it was time to reclaim the kingdom which he was born to rule , and he marched south with an army the next year			0
before meeting the enemy in battle , the prince erected a cross at a site called @entity123 , near @entity124 in @entity52 , and prayed to @entity73 - promising to found a monastery if his prayer was answered			0
fame : a decorated box made in @entity129 in the 12th century to hold some of the remains of @entity0 , who was venerated across @entity38 as a saint and martyr inspiration : @entity16 , left , was apparently based on @entity0 by @entity17 author @entity14 , right power : this entry from the @entity138 claims that @entity0 held hegemony over the other kingdoms in @entity5 during his reign @entity0 of @entity1 was a crucial figure in early @entity5 politics , but author @entity20 believes that he is also linked to the @entity145 ' greatest cultural achievement - beowulf			1
the epic poem is set in a great feasting hall , @entity148 , which mr @entity20 compares directly to the halls where @entity0 held court			0
it is not known when @entity152 was written , but the poem contains references to both @entity6 and paganism , suggesting that it might date to the period of conversion when @entity0 ruled			2
mr @entity20 says that he is not the first scholar to link the heroic king with the fictional warrior			0
' @entity14 thought there was a link between @entity0 and @entity152 ' , mr @entity20 told @entity163 - adding that the character of @entity16 might have been created as a composite of both men			1
in @entity152 , the eponymous hero leaves his home , the land of the @entity170 , to fight on behalf of the @entity171 , before returning to claim the @entity173 throne			0
the story bears striking similarities to that of @entity0 , an exile who won back his birthright - not to mention that of @entity16 's quest to become king of @entity183 after helping lead the mission to destroy the all - powerful ring			1
@entity0 was successful in battle and finally became king of @entity1 at the age of 30			2
he subsequently expanded his power , and was said by later @entity145 to have been the overlord of all @entity5 , as well as receiving tribute from the @entity54 and the @entity114			2
however , mr @entity20 claims that @entity0 's greatest achievement was not political , but cultural - fulfilling his vow to @entity73 , the king set up a new monastery , populated by @entity91 monks , on the island of @entity24			1
the community is now famous for producing the @entity70 , one of the most magnificent manuscripts in history , but mr @entity20 insists that its significance , as the first religious institution set up by an @entity5 king , is much greater			0
' it 's the first state institution since @entity206 , ' the author told @entity163			0
' @entity0 is the king who first makes @entity208 - he binds church and state together			0
' the tradition of state - backed religion started by @entity24 was responsible for many of the key moments in @entity4 history , according to mr @entity20 , from the @entity216 to the reformation			0
@entity0 also seems to have had an impact on the @entity5 landscape , by developing the unique palace site of @entity221 , a few miles from the modern border with @entity54			1
this stronghold , occupied by several generations of @entity1 kings , has been found to contain not only the drinking halls which many associate with the medieval period , but a bizarre ' grandstand ' where kings could address their subjects or vice versa			0
palace : @entity221 , now a desolate site near the @entity54 border , was a thriving royal complex in @entity0 's time remnants : ' @entity0 's gate ' is the only part of the seventh - century fortress at @entity82 which survives today death : ' @entity0 's well ' in @entity243 , @entity241 is said to mark the site where the king died in 642 @entity0 ruled for eight years , before being killed in battle by the pagan @entity247 , of neighbouring @entity248 , at the battle of @entity243 - thought to have taken place near the town of @entity243 in @entity241			1
under normal @entity254 circumstances , that might have been the end of his @entity1 kingdom - but thanks to the institutions created by @entity0 , his younger brother @entity257 was able to take over , and the state survived intact			2
' for the first time , there 's an idea that the state might survive the king , which is the beginning of the world we live in today , ' mr @entity20 says			0
despite @entity0 's importance in forging the origins of the @entity5 government , we know very little about him as an individual person			1
the @entity273 , the great historian who told us nearly everything we know about seventh - century @entity5 , was more interested in religious controversy than in the personality of kings			0
book : @entity0 's story is told in a biography by @entity20 entitled @entity0 in the @entity46 ' we ca n't tell how tall he is , or what he looks like , ' mr @entity20 says			1
' but he 's probably more magical because we do n't know enough to know what a thug he probably was			0
' @entity0 is not the only @entity138 king who helped craft the world we live in today - @entity286 , @entity288 and @entity287 were at least as influential - but mr @entity20 says he perfectly embodies the clash of values which defined the transition from the ancient past to an @entity5 we can still recognise			2
in @entity0 in the @entity46 , mr @entity20 writes : ' in @entity0 , pagan and @entity208 , @entity4 and @entity103 , sacral and temporal were fused as in no other king of the early medieval period			0
' as a resident of the far north of @entity5 , the author was also attracted to @entity0 because of the possibility of re-tracing the landscape where he lived , whether by returning to landmarks such as @entity24 ( also known as @entity24 ) and @entity304 , or by mapping out the smaller centres of power which defined how people lived			2
one previous writer who seems to have been inspired by the story of @entity0 was @entity14 - who , when not penning his tales of @entity311 , was professor of @entity138 at the @entity312			1
mr @entity20 believes that @entity0 's return to his homeland after a long exile , winning the throne by bravery in battle , inspired the character of @entity16 , who joins @entity321 the hobbit on a quest to destroy the @entity324 before returning to @entity183 , the land of his ancestors , and claiming his rightful place as king			1
' @entity14 is extremely familiar with @entity0 's story , ' the author says			1
' he fulfils that need for a heroic type			0
the idea of the returning righteous hero is absolutely central to @entity14 's work			0
' according to mr @entity20 , both @entity0 and @entity16 fulfil a universal human need - the desire for a comeback , which can still be a powerful narrative for modern - day sportsmen and celebrities			2
while the seventh - century king is little - known today , he was famous across @entity38 for several centuries after his death - not as a ruler , but as a saint			0
@entity0 's legacy continued throughout the medieval period , as his bones were scattered around @entity38 and treasured by the religious communities which held them			2
the @entity0 in the @entity46 : @entity350 of @entity351 , by @entity20 , is published by @entity352 and is out now .			0

@entity47 was exiled from native @entity1 and grew up in @entity54
but in *634* , he returned to his homeland and claimed the throne
new biography describes how he converted the @entity5 to @entity6 and founded the great monastery of @entity24
@entity0 's quest to reclaim his birthright apparently inspired @entity14 , an @entity138 scholar , to write the story of @entity16 in @entity17
