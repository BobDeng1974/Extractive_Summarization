by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:14 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 12:21 est , 10 december 2012 @entity2 today revealed how the rough and tumble of life in politics had not prepared him for the onslaught of abuse from @entity9 trolls , telling him to lose weight and wishing he was dead			1
the prime minister said he had been stunned by the stream of vitriol which every message on the site attracted – though he let slip it is not always him typ [ ing the 140 characters			1
as @entity19 leader in 2009 he declared on live radio that he would not join @entity9 , warning : ‘ too many tweets might make a t * * *			1
’ @entity2 revealed how an apparently innocuous picture of him talking on the telephone to @entity25 attracted an angry response about his weight but this autumn the @entity11 announced he would be making a foray into the @entity29 , promising an ‘ edgier ’ outlook than the official number 10 account which is monitored by civil servants			1
nothing mr @entity2 has posted since has come close to the bitter response from other users to his @ @entity36 account			1
‘ you get a lot of abuse in politics , i do n’t mind that , but you have to get used to trolls , ’ mr @entity2 told a lunch for journalists in @entity39			2
‘ trolls are my new favourite things			2
i have had some very good things			2
’ however , he admitted that aides are more likely to be posting to the account than himself			0
last month a photograph was released on the account of him talking on the telephone , apparently to @entity54 president @entity25			0
‘ i tweeted the other day , apparently – or someone tweeted on my behalf – i tweeted the other day about that picture of me talking to @entity25 , celebrating the special relationship and his re-election			0
‘ and a particularly unpleasant troll tweeted back : “ nevermind the special relationship … looks like you ’d do better on the @entity62 diet			0
” news of a royal baby was not enough to stop one of the @entity11 's trolls from wishing he was dead he also revealed that an apparently harmless message responding to the news that prince @entity70 and @entity71 were expecting a baby had been seized on by trolls			2
here is a selection of some of the comments which @ @entity36 was bombarded with soon after starting his account : ‏ @entity79 , what atrocities are you planning to inflict on the working classes today then ? # toriesruiningthenation ‏ @ @entity84 , this is your daily reminder that thousands of @entity86 's most vulnerable people are suffering more thanks to you			1
@ thisisamy _ i am seriously angry by @ @entity36 's comments			1
stop lying & pretending you 're helping the poor & vulnerable			0
you do not care one bit			0
why are n't your sleeves rolled up , @entity84 ? ‏ @ bethemediauk i thought you said you would n't tweet much			2
‘ i tweeted that the @entity101 and @entity71 would make wonderful parents , and the troll rapidly tweeted back “ and you ’d make a wonderful corpse ”			2
this is what happens on @entity9			0
’ the prime minister did not appear to regret his u-turn after ruling out joining @entity9 , saying it had added to an ‘ interesting year ’ for me			1
media watchdog @entity110 cleared @entity111 of breaching broadcasting regulations despite 20 complaints from listeners after mr @entity2 ’s foul - mouthed outburst on the @entity117 breakfast show in 2009			2
‘ the adjudication from @entity110 is on the wall in @entity120 , ’ he said today			0
when someone joked it was hanging in ‘ the loo ’ , the @entity11 replied : ‘ no , it ’s in the hallway it ’s a beautiful thing between two people			0
’ mr @entity2 also revealed that he did not watch suspended @entity19 mp @entity127 on tv reality show @entity128 , but said that he would be ' tempted ' to vote for @entity129 to undergo a bushtucker trial if the @entity132 mayor ever went onto the @entity134 show			1
but the @entity11 appeared to blunder when he claimed to have voted for @entity135 to win the @entity136 on the orders of his daughter @entity138			0
however , @entity135 won the first series of @entity140 in 2002 - two years before @entity138 's birth in 2004			0
mr @entity2 also revealed that he once had a ' fantastic conversation ' trying to explain i 'm a celebrity to @entity144 , when the former prime minister 's daughter @entity145 was a contestant in 2005			1
with millions of people – and potential voters – on @entity9 , the lure of the site became too strong to resist for the pm			0
ahead of the @entity19 party conference in october , mr @entity2 announced his arrival on the site with a reference to his 2009 warning : ‘ i 'm starting @entity156 with this new @entity9 feed about my role as conservative leader			1
i promise there wo n't be " too many tweets ... ’ before the account was set up aides promised it would be an ‘ edgy ’ and ‘ more political ’ outlet for the prime minister to target voters			1
one of the first pictures mr @entity2 posted on his @entity9 account featured a caterpillar birthday cake presented to him by his staff to date it has been rather more sedate , consisting of posts praising speeches by colleagues , alerting people to imminent tv appearances and photos of charity work			0
mr @entity2 was the 370th mp to start an account			0
within 12 hours the account had 75,000 followers but bookmakers @entity181 were offering odds of 25/1 that he would reach 100,000 before the @entity19 conference in @entity184 closed			1
he now has almost 184,000 followers .			1
