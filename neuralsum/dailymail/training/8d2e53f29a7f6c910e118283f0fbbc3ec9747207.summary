an artist has bought to life the visions he sees in the sky			2
in a project called @entity7 , @entity5 - based @entity4 sketches quirky interpretations of what he sees when he looks up at the sky			1
he said : ' i started shaping clouds during my trip to @entity14 last summer			1
i spent a lot of time on the road , so i admired the landscapes very often and for a long time			0
' one day i began to notice that cloud shapes was not like the clouds of @entity5			2
the sky was clear and the clouds were huge , misshapen and always changing			0
' at the same time i remembered that idea someone told me when i was a child about the origin of the cloud shapes and , right there , both thoughts merged , so i started photographing clouds that seemed to me like something			0
' as i started drawing clouds , i realised that if i added accessories to the characters it would make them funnier and at the same time , every cloud would have a story			0
' the artist noticed that the clouds in @entity14 were ' huge , misshapen and always changing ' in the clear blue skies the fur cap on the @entity42 was originally a wig but @entity4 adapted the image as he drew around the clouds on the light table base @entity4 describes this little dog scampering across the sky as a ' rare ' breed - and named the mutt ' @entity49 ' the artist spent a long time on the road in @entity14 and found himself looking at the landscapes for hours on end the drawings are influenced by stories @entity4 was told as a child about the origins of clouds , combined with his own creativity @entity4 realised that if he added accessories to the characters it would make them funnier and at the same time every cloud would have its own story @entity4 uses special transparent paper for his sketches			1
he places the photographs on light table and draws his creations over the top in black pen @entity4 draws the first thing that comes into his mind when he sees the clouds , and some of the creations are surprisingly intricate as a child was told that clouds â€™ shapes were created by expert balloon twister clowns who live in the sky the clouds in @entity14 served as a constant source of inspiration for @entity4 to created a weird and wonderful assortment of pictures the artist has posted all of the images online on a @entity93 page under the name @entity95 project so fans can view all his creations in one place			1
