by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 7 february 2013 germans are the most forward - thinking people on the planet , overtaking @entity3 who fell to fourth place , according to researchers			1
the scientists , based in the @entity3 , @entity7 and the @entity8 , correlated data from @entity11 searches and national economic performance			0
they looked at the ' mammoth amounts of data ' generated by our internet use , and discovered that there are ' strong links between changes in the information users are seeking online and events in the real world '			0
which nation has the most forward - looking citizens ? researchers linked economic performance to optimism about the future and found that @entity29 led the way , with @entity3 dropping to fourth place they analysed some 45 billion @entity11 search queries and found ' a striking correlation ' between the per capita gdp of a nation and the inclination of people to look to the future			1
dr @entity37 , co-author of the report , says the findings could reflect international differences in the type of information that people search for lead researcher professor @entity44 of @entity45 said : ' in general , we find a strong tendency for countries in which @entity11 users enquire more about the future to exhibit a larger per capita gdp			1
' there seems to be a relationship with the economic success of a country and the information seeking behavior of its citizens online			0
' the team first published a set of results last year			1
for this year 's results , the team looked at data from @entity64 for 45 countries , and found that @entity29 is the most forward - looking nation - knocking the @entity3 off the top spot from last year			1
brits topped the league table last year as people looked forward to the @entity71 and @entity72			1
this year @entity3 has dropped down to fourth place , swapping places with the @entity29 as they romp into the lead			1
the league table : @entity29 leads the way , while @entity78 and @entity79 languish at the bottom for the second year running @entity11 has been accused of racism after allegedly linking names usually associated with black people to adverts related to criminality			1
a @entity87 professor found ' significant discrimination ' after comparing the adverts which appear when searching a typically black name compared with those for typically white names			0
findings showed that names typically associated with black people were 25 per cent more likely to bring up adverts related to criminality			0
findings showed that names typically associated with black people were 25 per cent more likely to bring up adverts related to criminality			0
the findings raise ' questions as to whether @entity11 's advertising technology exposes racial bias in society and how ad and search technology can develop to assure racial fairness , ' professor @entity99 said in a blog post			1
@entity11 defends the process as race - neutral , saying outcomes are driven by decisions by advertisers			0
that could be because the @entity29 are focused on their federal elections later this year			2
the biggest climbers on the @entity117 are @entity118 and @entity119			1
however , right down the bottom of the list for the second year running is @entity78 , with @entity79 again in the penultimate slot			2
to create the league table , the team counted the number of searches done about previous and forthcoming years - for example , searches done in 2009 on 2008 or 2010			2
then they divided the results by country and mapped them against each country 's per capita gdp - the measure of a country 's economic output divided by the number of people who live there			0
co-author dr @entity37 added : ' we see two leading explanations for this relationship between search activity and gdp			2
' firstly , these findings may reflect international differences in attention to the future and the past , where a focus on the future supports economic success			0
' secondly , these findings may reflect international differences in the type of information sought online , perhaps due to economic influences on available internet infrastructure			0
' leading the way : upcoming federal elections could be the reason that the @entity29 are first as the most forward - looking people on the planet troubled times : @entity78 is at the bottom of the optimism league for the second year running			2

researchers shifted through 45 billion search queries
biggest climbers are @entity118 and @entity119 on previous year
