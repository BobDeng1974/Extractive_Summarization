welfare and education reforms will ensure more @entity3 fill jobs which go to immigrants , @entity0 suggested today			1
the prime minister said the @entity3 needs ' proper immigration control ' with both the @entity8 and the rest of the world , but suggested changes were needed to prepare people to take the ' jobs that we are creating in our country today '			1
it comes as @entity17 , the @entity3 's biggest sandwich maker , plans to recruit hundreds of workers from @entity19 because no @entity3 will do the job			0
however , a string of @entity8 leaders have raised objections to the idea of changes to what they see as a fundamental right across the 28 - nation bloc			1
home secretary @entity39 insisted that there was a ' growing recognition ' in @entity43 capitals of the need to reform freedom of movement rules , as she sought to downplay the government 's looming failure to meet a @entity50 pledge on immigration			1
mr @entity0 promised to limit net migration to @entity3 to the tens of thousands ' no ifs , no buts '			1
today mrs may suggested it was not a promise , but only a ' comment '			1
@entity60 later stressed it remained an ' objective '			0
in a speech to the @entity63 today , mr @entity0 said that tighter immigration controls must be matched by reforms to the @entity3 's welfare and education systems to enable @entity3 workers to fill the jobs currently done by foreigners			1
last night it emerged @entity17 , which supplies @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 's , @entity75 and @entity76 , admits it will have to recruit most of the 300 workers it needs from @entity79			0
@entity80 , @entity17 's human resources director , said the company had tried to recruit in the @entity3 , but that it was ' not always the kind of work ' which people wanted to do			2
the £ 35million factory , in @entity85 , is due to open in early 2016			0
mrs @entity80 said low unemployment meant few locals could be found to fill vacancies , although there are around 8,000 jobless in the town , a rate of 6.8 per cent – the national average – while in nearby @entity95 it is 9.5 per cent and @entity96 8.7 per cent			0
the prime minister told the @entity63 conference that ' proper ' controls on immigration were needed with the @entity8 , and the rest of the world in @entity79 , the average wage is little more than £ 7,000			1
even if workers coming here were on the minimum wage , they would earn almost double that – £ 13,520 a year			0
and they would have their wages topped up with tax credits – seen as a major attraction for @entity8 migrants – and housing benefit			2
these mean a migrant with no dependants on the minimum wage has their net income of about £ 184 a week boosted to £ 254 , studies have suggested			0
mr @entity0 suggest more needed to be done to the benefits system to persuade people living in the @entity3 to take jobs on offer			1
he said : ' we need to have proper immigration control			0
we need to do more , both outside the @entity8 and , frankly , inside the @entity8			2
' but the flipside of the coin on immigration is a welfare system that rewards work and an education system that turns out people with the skills necessary to do the jobs that we are creating in our country today			1
' no immigration policy will succeed unless it 's accompanied by that welfare and that education reform as well			2
' the latest official figures showed 243,000 more migrants came to the @entity3 than left in the year to march , up from 175,000 the previous year			0
successful efforts to reduce arrivals from the rest of the world to 1990s ' levels have been outweighed by a surge from the @entity8			2
the prime minister is due to set out detailed proposals for reforming freedom of movement rules before the end of the year in an attempt to reduce the flow			1
he has pledged to put @entity3 's @entity8 membership to an in / out referendum in 2017 if the @entity50 form the next government in 2015			2
@entity17 ( pictured ) say they have failed to attract many applications from potential employees in @entity85 - so bosses are now travelling to @entity79 to recruit some of the 300 - strong workforce needed @entity162 chancellor @entity161 has made clear she regards the principle of free movement of labour within the @entity8 as non-negotiable and is reported to have warned the prime minister that his drive is pushing @entity3 towards ' a @entity168 ' on the road to exit from @entity19			1
similar concerns were aired by northern @entity43 leaders at a summit in @entity173 last week , where mr @entity0 acknowledged there were ' different perspectives ' but insisted there was ' common ground ' on the need to reform			2
mrs may told @entity181 's today : ' what i have seen over the last few years - because i have been talking about freedom of movement for some time in @entity19 - is a growing recognition from other countries that actually there are issues			0
' it is possible to get change in this area			0
there is a growing concern across the @entity8 of the way in which free movement is being used			2
we are seeing it being abused , possibly by criminal gangs that are trafficking human beings , we are seeing it being abused through sham marriages			0
' mr @entity0 promised to cut net migration to the ' tens of thousands ' but latest figures show the figure standing at 243,000 asked about other member states ' concerns , she said : ' they have been clear about the principle of freedom of movement			1
i would n't expect them to be anything otherwise			0
' we are going to be going into a negotiation that would lead to a referendum in 2017 ... you would n't expect everybody to be giving everything away to us at this stage			0
' in a 2011 speech setting out his immigration target , mr @entity0 said levels would be cut to manageable levels - ' no ifs , no buts '			1
but ministers have been forced to concede that now looks a near - impossibility			0
asked about it , mrs may said : ' when we made that , er , comment ... we said we would be aiming to bring the net migration down to the tens of thousands and we wanted to do that within this parliament			1
yes , we were very clear that 's what we wanted to do			0

wants ' more ' done to control numbers from the @entity8 and worldwide
benefits must ' reward work ' to fill jobs we are ' creating in our country '
@entity0 promised to cut net migration to the ' tens of thousands '
