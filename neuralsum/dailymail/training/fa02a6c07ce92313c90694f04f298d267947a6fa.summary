on paper , there is little doubt that @entity3 is @entity4 's most valuable player			1
@entity5 may have a squad of stars , expensively assembled and with world class back - up in every position , but without their midfield general they are a different side			0
since @entity3 left to join up with the @entity13 for the current @entity14 , @entity4 have failed to win a single game			1
@entity3 celebrates after scoring a goal during the 2015 @entity14 semi-final @entity4 ace @entity3 ( @entity18 ) celebrates his goal with teammate @entity20 against @entity21 while a draw away at @entity23 was viewed by some as a positive result , and certainly a positive performance , the other three games have been a disappointment			1
defeat to @entity29 , their first at the @entity30 since 2010 , was followed by the dismal @entity32 exit at the hands of @entity34			0
throw in a draw with @entity36 , and the last month has been little short of a disaster			0
in fact , @entity4 have n't managed a @entity40 win without his powerful midfielder since april of last year			1
his return can not come quick enough			0
after sunday 's final , win or lose , @entity4 will be desperate to get their stars back to the @entity30 , if possible ahead of a tricky mid-week trip to @entity46			1
@entity3 complains to referee @entity47 after a penalty is awarded to @entity49 on wednesday but , if they have been paying attention to his performances here in @entity49 , @entity5 and his staff might have a few worries			2
played as a holding midfielder , @entity3 has been a shadow of his usual self at this tournament			1
while at @entity4 he runs the show , driving past players , making tackles , scoring goals and providing assists , at the @entity14 he has practically been a bystander as his team - mates have carried him to the verge of a major trophy			1
even a stunning strike against @entity21 could n't mask another below - par performance			2
@entity3 has never hit the same heights for his country as in his illustrious club career , but even more than in previous tournaments , the midfielder has been off the pace			1
@entity13 's players celebrate with fans after winning their semi-final match with @entity21 being outshone in midfield on wednesday night by @entity79 , the @entity81 centre - half playing as a makeshift midfielder , was a low point			1
it is tempting to say that five games in just 15 days might have taken a lot out of him , but he has offered so little on the pitch that tiredness can only be part of the problem			0
some onlookers have suggested that @entity3 is carrying an injury , which would be more bad news for @entity5			1
certainly he is not moving comfortably , his movement restricted by more than just positional discipline			0
for long periods in @entity99 he was moving at little more than walking pace			0
after @entity102 scored the @entity13 's third goal in @entity99 , ten @entity13 players charged to the bench to celebrate			2
by the time they had finished , and returned to the pitch , @entity3 , had barely reached the edge of the penalty area , trudging back alone			2
@entity13 's defender @entity109 celebrates his goal as @entity13 progress to the final @entity102 celebrates his goal with defender @entity113 in @entity99 on wednesday there is no doubt that the 31 - year - old is still a leader			2
during the warm - up before wednesday night 's game he gave what looked like a rousing speech to his players			2
anyone who saw it would laugh off the suggestion that he ' does n't care ' about playing for his country			0
but , more and more , his leadership seems to be coming through words , and not the all - action performances we know he can provide			0
even off the pitch he has not been his usual self			0
most teams here have put their captain forward to talk to the press before and after every game			0
here , @entity3 has spoken just once , before his country 's opener against @entity49			2
@entity13 fans show their admiration for midfielder toure against @entity21 in @entity99 aside from that he has shunned all interviews , merely walking past journalists saying ' there is no problem ' after he had been replaced against @entity147			1
it may be that @entity4 's star has been stung by criticism of his performances			0
@entity13 coach @entity152 implied that his captain had been answering his critics with his fabulous goal that opened the scoring against @entity21			1
but if @entity3 is trying his utmost to prove people wrong on the pitch by showing his best form , then the best he can manage is some way beneath the standard we have come to expect			0
many reports suggest @entity3 is carrying an injury which will come as a blow for @entity4 @entity5 will be hoping the midfielder can rediscover the form that led @entity4 to the title last year as he stormed past the waiting media again on wednesday night , without so much as a word , it was clear for all to see - something is not right with @entity3			1
@entity5 must hope that , when he returns to @entity174 next week , he can rediscover the form that led @entity4 to the title last year			0
because if the @entity3 of the @entity14 returns , instead of the toure of 2014 , @entity4 can kiss their title aspirations goodbye			1
@entity5 and @entity3 will be hoping to recreate their title celebrations again this season			0

@entity4 have failed to win a game since he left for @entity14 2015
@entity3 has looked off the pace for @entity13 at the tournament so far
many are suggesting the midfielder is carrying an injury into games
