by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 18 october 2012 @entity3 's baby boom is being driven by a triple whammy of immigration , recession and thousands of older mothers anxious to have families before it is too late , an official analysis said today			1
it pointed to a catch - up generation of mothers in their late 30s and 40s who delayed having children for the sake of education and careers as partly responsible for pushing birth numbers up to their highest level in 40 years			1
alongside older mothers , birth rates are rising because of high numbers of mothers born abroad and the impact of recession and the efforts of politicians to cope with it , the @entity19 said			0
up and up : last year 's baby count was 22 per cent higher than the 594,634 recorded in 2001 the report , which carried the final tally of numbers of children born in @entity3 and @entity34 last year , said there were 723,913 babies			1
this was a slight increase - 0.1 per cent - on the 723,165 in 2010			0
older mums : a catch - up generation of mothers in their late 30s and 40s have been anxious to have children before it 's too late births have gone up every year for a decade that has seen the total rise by more than a fifth			1
last year 's baby count was 22 per cent higher than the 594,634 recorded in 2001			0
the last time more children were born in @entity3 and @entity34 in a year was 1972			1
' there is no single explanation underlying the overall increases in fertility since 2001 , which are likely to have resulted from a combination of factors , ' the report said			0
' possible causes may include women born in the 1960s and 70s who postponed childbearing in their 20s catching up in their 30s and 40s , and increases in the numbers of foreign born women with above average fertility rates			1
' it suggested a further cause may be ' government policy and the economic climate indirectly influencing individuals ' decisions around childbearing and therefore affecting numbers of births , although this does not have a clear impact on fertility in a particular direction			0
' among state policies that can influence couples ' decisions on children are tax and benefit changes , such as the introduction of tax credits for mothers or the cutbacks in child benefit for higher earners			0
according to the breakdown , the number of mothers in their 40s has risen more than fourfold over the past 30 years , from 6,860 in 1981 to 29,350 last year			2
over a decade numbers of 40 - something mothers went up by 61 per cent those aged between 35 and 39 by 51 per cent			2
baby boom : the last time more children were born in @entity3 and @entity34 in a year was 1972 the shift towards older motherhood means the average age of a new mother is 29.7 , up from 26.4 in 1973 , in the last period that birth numbers were so high			1
' the overall rise since 1973 reflects the increasing numbers of women who have been delaying childbearing to later ages , ' the @entity19 said			0
' possible influences include increased participation in higher education , increased female participation in the labour force , the increasing importance of a career , the rising opportunity costs of childbearing , labour market uncertainties , and instability of partnerships			0
' the difficulties faced by many women in forming a stable partnership with a man were underlined by the figures for births inside and outside marriage			0
at work : mothers in their late 30s and 40s have delayed having children for the sake of education and careers last year the share of babies born to unmarried mothers went up to a record 47.2 per cent , up from 40.0 per cent in 2001			1
many of these babies are born to cohabiting mothers , whose relationships are much more likely to break up than marriages			2
' possible influences include increased participation in higher education , increased female participation in the labour force , the increasing importance of a career , the rising opportunity costs of childbearing , labour market uncertainties , and instability of partnerships ' @entity19 report just over one in four babies , 25.5 per cent , were born to a mother who was herself born abroad			2
this figure has gone up from 11.6 per cent in 1990 , and the @entity19 said that ' recent rises in the number of births to @entity169 born women can be mainly attributed to the increase in the population of women born outside the @entity169			0
' latest @entity19 figures say the population of @entity3 and @entity34 has gone up by around four million in a decade , with immigration responsible for the great majority of the extra numbers			1
the report said that a high proportion of foreign - born women are of childbearing age and they have on average higher fertility rates than @entity184 - born women .			2
