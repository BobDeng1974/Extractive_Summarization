by @entity1 correspondent nearly half a million tv viewers avoid paying the licence fee every year by only watching @entity6 content online , it has emerged			1
the corporation has admitted that up to two per cent of all households exploit a legal loophole that permits them to catch up on their favourite shows on @entity13 for free			1
and although households are technically required to buy a £ 145.50 licence if they watch live broadcasts on tablets or computers , it is thought many avoid detection because the @entity6 is unable to monitor who is watching on the internet			1
up to two per cent of all households exploit a legal loophole that permits them to catch up on their favourite shows on @entity13 for free critics said the figures prove the licence fee is now ‘ out of date ’ , and even the @entity6 admitted its current funding model creates ‘ perverse incentives ’ that encourage viewers to use its catch - up service instead of watching live			1
as director general @entity36 pushes ahead with an ambitious £ 100million a year plan to put even more of the @entity6 ’s content online , some suggested the government will have to rethink the entire licence fee arrangement when it renews the @entity6 charter in 2016			1
@entity43 , chief executive of the @entity44 ’ @entity42 , said : ‘ the model for the licence fee is long out of date thanks to technological advances			1

’ writing to the @entity56 – which is conducting an inquiry into the corporation ’s future – the @entity6 this week admitted its licence fee arrangements may need to be modernised to keep up with new technology			1
' we do n't pay a television licence - he watches next door 's telly ' it said : ‘ the licence fee definition remains robust , with only 1 - 2 per cent of households consuming exclusively on - demand content and so not requiring a licence fee			1
‘ however , the definition could start to create perverse incentives , with a fee payable for some ways of consuming @entity76 but not others			0
‘ we would welcome discussing this issue with the committee to consider whether and when the licence fee should be modernised again			2
’ given there are 26.4million households in the @entity84 , the @entity6 ’s admission means that as many as 528,000 could be evading the licence fee by using the catch - up loophole			1
last year , 428,359 signed official declarations saying they did not need a tv licence			0
viewers are only required to buy a licence if they watch live broadcasts , regardless of whether they own a television set or not			0
