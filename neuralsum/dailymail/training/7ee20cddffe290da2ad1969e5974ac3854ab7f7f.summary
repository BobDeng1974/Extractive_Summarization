hot - stepping his way into the hallowed halls of @entity3 , the popular @entity6 drama 's newest star @entity4 made quite the impression when he made his debut on sunday night 's episode			1
audiences had been eagerly awaiting the jazz singer 's first appearance , and although @entity4 looks set to shake up the @entity14 , his antics will likely pale in comparison to those of the real - life musician on who @entity3 's newest resident is said to be based			1
the show 's first black character , played by actor @entity22 , is thought to have been inspired by @entity23 - the @entity24 cabaret star who charmed a string of women , and became embroiled in a scandal with @entity28 , @entity29 of @entity30			1
he found fans among the rich and famous , including the then @entity44 , later @entity59 , and infamously @entity28 , the wife of the @entity44 's cousin lord @entity61 , much to the horror of her royal in - laws			1
@entity3 's creator , @entity64 , may find that some of @entity67 's escapades prove a little too much for cosy sunday evening audiences - one of his boasts that may not make the @entity72 storylines was that he had a larger ' endowment ' than any other man on earth			1
born @entity67 in @entity76 in march 1900 , @entity38 moved to @entity77 as a teenager to study for a degree in medicine , but became sidetracked when he started playing the piano and singing in bars			2
instant attraction : wealthy @entity28 , married to the @entity86 ' cousin , was introduced to the talented young singer following a performance of his @entity89 show one dam ' thing after moving to @entity92 to further his musical career , in 1927 he found himself in @entity94 where he swiftly became a society darling , and was for a time the highest - paid star in the country			1
despite his success , @entity38 found that his rise to the top was hindered by the prejudice of @entity47 society at the time , and as a black man he was barred from sharing a stage with white women			1
his @entity89 show one @entity106 , which boasted costumes designed by @entity108 , garnered fantastic reviews - despite the fact that @entity112 magazine would not include his name in them			0
@entity38 was one of the first stars in @entity47 to volunteer to entertain the troops at home and abroad during @entity118 , but he received no formal recognition for his service , and his name would never appear in any honours list			2
when he entertained at lavish @entity124 parties , his fee was large , but he was often obliged to go in by the servants ' entrance			0
it was during his performances in @entity129 that @entity67 first attracted the attention of his royal fans , after the @entity44 , @entity61 - and @entity28 - were watching from the theatre 's boxes on opening night			2
wealthy @entity28 , the daughter of @entity135 's banker sir @entity134 , was said to be instantly enthralled and at the post-show party she was introduced to the talented young singer , according to biographer @entity137			1
a few nights later @entity38 , who was himself married to wife @entity138 , was said to have sung directly to @entity28 when he performed a late - night set at a @entity94 nightspot			1

' [ she ] took off her chiffon scarf and put it round his neck and kissed him while he was playing			0
' at the time @entity38 was living with society belle @entity149 , and had enjoyed affairs with screen sirens @entity145 and @entity146 , as well as another bright young thing , ' @entity154			2
the @entity89 's leading matinee idol , @entity155 , was also rumoured to have been one of bisexual @entity67 's lovers , and in 1930 @entity38 made debutante @entity158 pregnant			1
when the child was black @entity158 's guards - officer husband was appalled , and the baby was given up for adoption			0
none of that seemed to deter @entity28 , however , with one @entity166 producer @entity165 telling ms @entity137 : ' i was at a grand party			2
' @entity28 interrupted @entity67 playing the piano			2
she kissed his neck and led him by the hand behind the closed doors of the dining - room			0
there was a shriek , and a few minutes later she returned , straightening her clothes			0
' @entity38 seemed elated , and before he returned to the piano , told me that , with one thrust , he had flashed [ propelled ] her the length of the dining - room table			2
' @entity28 was said to have showered @entity67 with presents , including a jewelled gold cigarette case , a gold ring with her coat of arms engraved on the inside , and a gold and diamond watch			1
she was even thought to have commissioned a jewelled sheath for @entity67 's aforementioned manhood			0
the singer would proudly show off the sheath to his fellow musicians			0
although the affair caught the attention of @entity199 gossip columnists , the @entity47 press were doing their best to ignore the scandal , even when @entity38 took @entity28 with him to perform for inmates at @entity202			1
happier times : @entity61 , 1st @entity204 , married wife @entity28 in july 1922 eventually , in 1932 , @entity206 cracked			2
it launched a thinly veiled attack on a ' leading hostess ' who was been ' caught in compromising circumstances ' with a black man			0
many took the article to mean that @entity28 was having a relationship with another black singer , @entity215 , and the resulting @entity217 libel case caused a furore when @entity28 boldly told how she had never met @entity215 - which he confirmed			1
facing the wrath of the @entity59 , the people eventually backed down and shelled out damages to charity , with its barrister sir @entity225 forced to make a grovelling apology - ' genuine and deep regrets ' - on behalf of the newspaper 's owners			0
the @entity230 were invited to lunch at @entity232 the next day in a public show of marital solidarity			0
new arrival : audiences have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of @entity3 's new character @entity4 though still a celebrity , without his royal approval @entity38 began to fall from grace			1
he was dropped from @entity166 radio shows and found that he could no longer win bookings at many theatres			0
he was struggling to make ends meet and when his wife @entity247 died in 1958 she was buried in an unmarked pauper 's grave at a cost of £ 12			0
