by @entity0 published : 17:22 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 20:54 est , 25 january 2013 here 's a golden chance , quite literally , for @entity2 to give a boost to tourism in @entity5			1
the royal family of @entity7 has offered to donate 100 kg gold to build a dome atop the @entity11 temple it has constructed in @entity13			1
but the chief minister is running scared of accepting this glittering gift , valued at ` 35 crore by the current market rate of gold			2
if tourism ministry sources are to be believed , @entity2 is afraid that the temple with a golden dome will create a law and order problem in the holy town and that it would be difficult to guard the structure			2
@entity7 's @entity24 ( left ) has offered to donate the gold			1
but @entity5 chief minister @entity2 has concerns that 's why , they claim , the @entity5 government has been sitting on the proposal communicated to it by the @entity7 royal trust , managed by the @entity24 's office , almost five months ago			1
" the state government has expressed its inability to provide adequate security to a temple having 100 - kg gold plating on its top , '' a senior official said			1
but the patience of the @entity7 royal trust and tourism authorities seems to be running out			2
apparently unhappy with their experience of dealing with the state administration , they took their plea to expedite the matter to @entity49 tourism minister @entity48			2
a team of @entity7 tourism officials and an @entity53 delegation met @entity48 at the @entity55 airport on wednesday during his brief stopover there on his way back to @entity58 from @entity59 after attending the @entity62 tourism ministers ' conclave			2
he promised the @entity7 authorities all help			2
when contacted , @entity48 told @entity65 : " i have sought more details from the @entity53 mission in @entity55			0
i have been requested to take up the matter with the state government to clear the proposal soon			0
i am going to talk to @entity71 and persuade him to expedite the matter			0
" the minister asserted that the royal gift would benefit @entity5 and eventually @entity53			1
it will not only enrich the temple town , but is also likely to make @entity13 more popular among the tourists flocking to the @entity79 circuit , he added			2
the @entity13 temple is important for @entity5 's tourism " one can not underestimate the instant global publicity it will give to @entity13 and to other @entity79 circuit spots in the state			1
it will also give impetus to infrastructure development , including hotels and connectivity modes , to attract more tourists from @entity62 countries , " he said			0
@entity2 could not be unaware of all this			0
it 's safe to presume that he pretty well realises that the move will be a free publicity for state tourism , which is in dire need of a lift			0
despite that , his government has been reluctant to acquiesce to the offer because of safety concerns			0
@entity65 tried to contact the @entity105 on friday afternoon , but he was not available			0
this correspondent left his contact details for a response from his office , but there was none till late evening			0
however , the central government officials cited the issue to put the @entity2 government in dock over his claims of improved governance and law and order			0
" if you ca n't provide security in a globally - acclaimed @entity79 circuit hotspot like @entity13 , which is also the main revenue earner for @entity5 's tourism department , then what is the assurance for other areas in the state ? " an official asked			1
interestingly , the tourism ministry babus also took a dig at their @entity5 counterparts for the red - tape and blame game that typifies bureaucracy			1
" there has been no response so far from the state to the @entity24 's trust			1
the government has blamed the authorities entrusted with granting permission , which include the temple trust in @entity13 , which is managed by nominees of the state administration and @entity79 monks			1
the local babus , on their part , do not miss an opportunity to blame the @entity154 and allege that it 's the @entity154 that is putting roadblocks , " a senior government official in @entity58 said			0
in @entity55 and @entity59 , @entity48 also received other complaints from @entity157 , the most common being about the lack of basic facilities , such as toilets , on the @entity79 trail taken by tourists in @entity53 , particularly in @entity5 , which mostly entails road journey in the state			1
senior ministry officials said @entity48 was almost speechless when his @entity59 counterparts raised the issue of hygiene around the @entity79 holy sites in @entity53			0
" we carry the @entity53 soil to our monasteries and keep it in our homes where we perform daily worship ... and feel really sad to see people relieving themselves next to our temples , '' the @entity59 tourism minister is learnt to have told @entity48 .			0
