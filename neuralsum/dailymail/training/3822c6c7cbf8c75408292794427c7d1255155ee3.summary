by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 returns to the @entity3 on wednesday night , with a new - look @entity5 team , designed to exorcise the ghosts of last season			1
after the humiliating 5 - 0 aggregate defeat to @entity11 in last year ’s semi-final , the initial diagnosis was psychological			1
@entity5 had rested on their laurels after winning the @entity13 in record time over a month previously , and even @entity2 admitted that he had been too emotional in preparing his players for the clash			1
but there were also on - field issues to consider			0
@entity5 , not used to conceding goals , had been run ragged on the counter attack			2
they had failed to use possession like they normally did , and were unable to find even the slightest gap in a less than impenetrable @entity11 defence			2
tactics and personnel at @entity5 needed a rethink			1
@entity28 scores the second goal in @entity11 's semi-final rout of @entity5 last season @entity33 scores real fourth goal in the 4 - 0 @entity3 win at the @entity35 @entity5 boss @entity2 has been forced into a tactical rethink after seeing his side capitulate since then , @entity2 has set about revitalising his team ’s make - up and tactical approach			1
first off , he launched into the transfer market			0
with @entity43 already secured , the main issue was bolstering the defence , particularly after the injuries suffered in that area			0
left back @entity47 was brought in from @entity48 , @entity49 from @entity50 , and , of course , @entity52 from @entity11			1
@entity52 is perhaps the most significant in terms of the fallout from @entity11			1
@entity5 ’s susceptibility on the counter attack is hugely reduced by his presence			2
it is hard to imagine , meanwhile , that the team would have capitulated so poorly had they had his experience and cool head on their side against @entity11			1
nonetheless , he is a quick fix			0
the reason @entity5 chose to prise @entity52 away from @entity11 , rather than @entity66 , was that the signing was always to be a short - term solution , designed to allow the space to develop for young midfielders @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
most important in @entity2 ’s mini-revolution , however , have been the tactical changes			2
in the past few months , he has put paid to the idea that he is a man without a @entity77 he has laughed in the face of the critics who say he has one formation and one style : tiki - taka			0
there have been mixed results			0
former @entity11 star @entity52 has been brought in by @entity5 to add more stability to their play @entity47 ( right ) was also brought in from @entity88 and has slotted in well at left back @entity49 ( right , with @entity89 ) is yet another summer defensive recruit at the @entity35 the first innovation was to revert to three at the back			1
@entity2 first showcased this approach during the @entity94 against @entity95 in may			2
this was a 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 , with @entity97 spearheading the @entity5 attack , and it worked a dream			2
@entity5 won 2 - 0 , and exorcised a few of the ghosts of @entity11			1
the back - three experiment , designed as much as anything to allow @entity105 to play in his favoured midfield role , has developed since then			0
it was ineffective in pre-season , and while the 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 saw them past @entity109 in the @entity110 , @entity5 were forced to revert to four at the back for their first three @entity13 games			2
injury to @entity114 meant that @entity105 was needed once more in defence , with him and @entity47 assuming classic full back positions in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1			2
that changed dramatically this weekend at @entity118 , with @entity2 forming what could best be described as a 3 - 1 - 3 - 1 - 2 , though that scarcely explains it			2
a back three opened out into the midfield diamond of @entity52 , @entity105 , @entity123 and @entity124 , while @entity47 and @entity125 were given free rein on the wings , with @entity43 up front			1
it brought a 2 - 0 victory			0
@entity131 will hope to exploit any remaining weakness in the @entity5 defence on wednesday night @entity47 ’s role has been instrumental to @entity2 ’s change			1
with @entity136 having left , the versatile @entity123 has slotted into his attacking midfield role , leaving @entity47 to fill the gap at left back			0
despite @entity136 ’ quality , @entity5 almost appear more flexible without him on paper			0
@entity123 and @entity47 , when on form , can synchronise on the left , with both as good in defence as in attack			0
it means that even without @entity89 , @entity5 remain extremely dangerous on the overlap			0
the back - three is still a work in progress for @entity5 , which , alongside injuries and fatigue , goes a long way to explaining their indifferent start to the season			1
but @entity2 ’s tinkering is not merely academic			0
it is the revitalisation of a system , designed to make @entity5 much more flexible in attack , and more importantly , much less susceptible to counter attacking in defence			0
@entity105 ’s words at tuesday ’s press conference said a great deal			0
' if we press the ball well , and are organised in defence , and attack from that basis , ( then we can outplay @entity131 ) '			0
last year at @entity5 , they were all talking about possession			0
this year it is more complex			0
it is more focused on a defensive stability			1
the world , and @entity131 tonight , have @entity11 to thank for that			1
@entity175 's @entity174 time is now - @entity2			1

@entity5 boss @entity2 has looked to add more defensive stability to his team 's tactics this season
this comes after @entity5 's trouncing by @entity11 in last season 's @entity3 semi-final
players such as @entity52 , @entity47 and @entity49 have been signed to add more defensive *resilience*
