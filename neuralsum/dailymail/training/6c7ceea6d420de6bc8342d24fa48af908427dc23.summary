@entity1 legend @entity0 has launched an astonishing attack on @entity3 and @entity4 – insisting they deserve ‘ a horrible reception ’ when they appear for @entity7 on friday night			1
the pair , both born and raised in @entity1 , used the grandparent ruling to pledge their allegiance to the @entity14			1
@entity3 , who was born in @entity15 , represented @entity1 schools as a teenager before switching while @entity18 - born midfielder @entity4 also spurned numerous approaches to declare for @entity1 , telling the @entity20 it was his @entity23 - born grandfather ’s dying wish that he represented @entity24			1
@entity4 was born and raised in @entity1 but chose to play for the @entity14 but @entity0 insists he has ‘ no time ’ for players who turn their backs on the country and the former @entity1 and @entity29 defender wants the @entity31 to make it as uncomfortable a night as possible for the @entity36 duo in friday ’s crunch @entity34 qualifier			1
‘ will it be hard for them coming back here with @entity24 ? i really hope so , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i hope they get a horrible reception because they deserve it			0
‘ you ’re either @entity45 or you ’re not @entity45 - and you should know that by the time you ’re 12 years of age			2
i ’m sure somebody must have asked them to play for @entity1 at some stage			1
‘ but , you ’re born in @entity18 but then you go and play for somebody else ? i hate that ! what ’s that all about ? i ’m not having that at all			2
i ’ve got no time for these players			0
’ @entity3 and @entity4 , who is an injury doubt ahead of friday ’s crucial encounter , were often met with a hostile reception at away grounds when they played in the @entity59			1
but @entity61 ace @entity60 has warned the @entity31 that booing @entity3 and @entity4 will only motivate @entity7 ’s side			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve played in local derbies where there is great hatred but i do n’t think @entity24 against @entity1 qualifies as one of those			1
the treatment @entity4 and @entity3 get could turn the atmosphere into something more like a typical derby			1
‘ if they get the reception that ’s expected , it will add to the tension and i know the @entity24 players will respond			0
’ for @entity0 , his anger against the pair is solely about his fervent pro-scottishness and although he is also frustrated by players who use the @entity81 as a flag of convenience			2
@entity3 also opted to play for the @entity61 ‘ i played alongside the likes of @entity84 and @entity85 , who were born in @entity86 but they always considered themselves @entity45			1
that ’s all i want			0
if you feel @entity45 then you ’re @entity45 ! ‘ i just hate these guys who think “ i ca n’t get a game for @entity86 so i ’ll play for @entity1 ”			2
’ @entity4 however has emerged as a major injury doubt for friday night ’s crunch qualifier			1
the midfielder may not be able to feature after complaining of tightness in his hamstring following a 90 - minute outing in @entity36 ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity99 yesterday			0
@entity36 manager @entity100 has revealed the @entity102 player will undergo tests to determine his readiness for international duty			0
‘ we are going to assess @entity4 , ’ said @entity100			2
‘ he was feeling his hamstring towards the end of the game but he wanted to stay on the pitch because we had used all three subs			0
‘ it is a bit of a concern because he had the same injury a few weeks back when he missed the game against @entity29 and it is in that area			0
we are hoping that it is more fatigue than a soft tissue problem			0
‘ we will assess him in the morning			0
’ @entity7 will confirm his final squad for the @entity1 game today but has further concerns over centre - back @entity124 and back - up goalkeeper @entity126			1
the loss of @entity84 , who limped out of @entity130 ’s match with @entity131 yesterday with a hamstring injury , would be the more serious blow			0
he has been the regular partner for @entity134 at the heart of the @entity61 defence in recent matches			0
@entity0 , who was capped 30 times and is in the @entity139 , believes that with a partisan @entity31 behind @entity141 ’s side , the @entity45 will blow the @entity61 away on friday			1
but he admitted he will feel ‘ ashamed ’ if @entity1 can not end their exile from major finals and said : ‘ i think we ’ll beat @entity24 at @entity146			1
there are certain grounds where the crowd just gets to the opposition			0
@entity151 have had some very average sides over the years but @entity154 teams coming to @entity146 were always intimidated by the atmosphere			2
@entity0 hopes @entity3 and @entity4 are given a ' horrible reception ' when they take on @entity1 ‘ as long as i live i ’ll never forget playing for @entity1 against @entity158 at @entity159 in 1977 in the game that took us to the @entity163 finals			1
the stadium was literally bouncing , with @entity1 fans everywhere you looked , even though it was their home game			2
we did n’t play well that night but we still won 2 - 0			0
‘ i think @entity141 is showing he ’s the ideal man for the @entity1 job			2
right now it looks as though everyone is on his side , regardless of the results			0
they ’ve been all right but what if we end up finishing fourth in this group ? ‘ personally , i think we will qualify but i would be ashamed if we did n’t because just about everybody gets to these finals – 24 countries			0
surely we can do that ? ’			0

@entity3 and @entity4 were both born in @entity1
but they pledged their allegiance to the @entity14
@entity0 says he has no time for those who turn their back
