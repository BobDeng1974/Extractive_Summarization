by @entity0 they had @entity3 technology , but their vision was millennia ahead of their time			0
five thousand years ago the ancient inhabitants of @entity8 - a fertile , green archipelago off the northern tip of @entity12 - erected a complex of monumental buildings unlike anything they had ever attempted before			1
these beautiful images , featured in the august issue of @entity18 , capture the structures - built an estimated two and a half thousand years before @entity20 - in all their grandeur			1
archaeological wonder : the @entity23 may be @entity25 ’s most ancient stone circle sentinels by the sea : @entity8 ’s largest tomb , @entity29 , is aligned to capture the rays of the setting sun on the eve of the winter solstice			1
' @entity8 is a key to understanding @entity35 religion , ' says site director @entity36			1
blessed : with fertile soil and a mild climate , @entity8 was a land of plenty for @entity35 homesteaders			1
agricultural wealth helped give them the freedom to pursue grand architectural dreams the workers quarried thousands of tons of fine - grained sandstone , trimmed it , dressed it , then transported it several miles to a grassy promontory with commanding views of the surrounding countryside			1
their workmanship was impeccable , writes @entity18 's @entity56			0
the imposing walls they built would have done credit to the @entity61 centurions who , some 30 centuries later , would erect @entity63 in another part of @entity25			1
cloistered within those walls were dozens of buildings , among them one of the largest roofed structures built in prehistoric northern @entity69			1
it was more than 80 feet long and 60 feet wide , with walls 13 feet thick			2
the complex featured paved walkways , carved stonework , colored facades , even slate roofs - a rare extravagance in an age when buildings were typically roofed with sod , hides , or thatch			2
macabre : in 1958 a farmer digging flagstones accidentally uncovered the 5,000 - year - old tomb of the @entity86			2
it held more than 16,000 human bones mingled with the talons of white - tailed eagles			0
sheep graze among the @entity23 , which may have been a model for @entity20			0
in 1814 a farmer tried to remove the ancient stones so he could more easily tend his fields fast - forward five millennia to a balmy summer afternoon on a scenic headland known as the @entity100			2
here an eclectic team of archaeologists , university professors , students , and volunteers is bringing to light a collection of grand buildings that long lay hidden beneath a farm field			0
archaeologist @entity36 , excavation director with the @entity111 at the @entity112 , said the recent discovery of these stunning ruins is turning @entity25 prehistory on its head			1
' this is almost on the scale of some of the great classical sites in the @entity121 , like the @entity122 in @entity123 , except these structures are 2,500 years older , ' he said			0
' like the @entity122 , this was built to dominate the landscape - to impress , awe , inspire , perhaps even intimidate anyone who saw it			2
the people who built this thing had big ideas			0
they were out to make a statement			0
' the full article and pictures appear in the august issue of @entity18			0
right , this domino - sized figure is the earliest depiction of a human face found in @entity25 what that statement was , and for whom it was intended , remains a mystery , as does the purpose of the complex itself			1
although it 's usually referred to as a temple , it 's likely to have fulfilled a variety of functions during the thousand years it was in use			0
' it 's clear that many people gathered here for seasonal rituals , feasts , and trade			0
i 've heard this place called the @entity161 , ' saidarchaeologist @entity162 , who came to @entity8 more than 30 years ago to excavate a @entity164 cemetery and never left			1
' turn over a rock around here and you 're likely to find a new site			0

these stunning images show standing stones of @entity8 off northern tip of @entity12 , built around 5,000 years ago
workers quarried thousands of tons of fine - grained sandstone , trimmed it , dressed it , then took it to grassy area
walls they built would have done credit to @entity61 centurions who later erected @entity63 in another part of @entity25
