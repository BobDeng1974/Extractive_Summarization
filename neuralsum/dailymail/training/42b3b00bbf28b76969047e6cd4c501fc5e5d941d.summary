by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 11:45 est , 6 march 2014 the supercomputer that beat @entity4 's greatest champs has now been put to use brainstorming innovative recipes to be served from an @entity7 food truck to customers eager for something new			1
@entity10 already impressed visitors at a @entity13 tech conference last week by devising recipes like @entity17 - @entity16 asparagus quiche and @entity19 chocolate burrito			2
the next stop is @entity22 's @entity21 , where @entity10 will continue making odd but delicious dishes like pork belly moussaka as @entity7 works to fit the technology into a convenient app that anyone can use			1
chefs begin by inputting a main ingredient ( for instance : apples ) and a regional cuisine such as @entity43			0
@entity10 then flips through a nearly endless database of recipes			2
using its bank of food chemistry knowledge and , astoundingly , human tastes , @entity10 then pairs the main ingredient with other far less likely ingredients			1
the offbeat list of ingredients @entity10 spits out may not always sound delicious -- suggesting apples has coaxed @entity10 to produce the offbeat garlicky , pork loin - laced @entity56 -- but it 's the taste that matters			1
' it has driven up some flavor pairings that we would not have thought of , ' @entity58 , one of the chefs working with @entity10 and @entity7 , told the @entity37			1
' but we have n't come across an instance yet where something did n't taste good			0
' another recipe devised by @entity10 was the pork belly moussaka , which calls for cottage cheese , red bell peppers , dill , pork belly and cheddar cheese			0
' i said , " no freaking way ! this sounds horrible , " ' said @entity58			0
' everyone who tasted it had to say , " wow			0
" ' pork belly apple pie , anyone ? chefs input a main ingredient and @entity10 pumps out a list of other ingredients that sound weird , but that science says tastes absolutely delicious @entity87 @entity86 et voila ! chef 's enter a main ingredients and a regional cuisine of their choice milk : 255 g , divided butter : 44 g , divided molasses : 28 g @entity96 : 1 tsp nutmeg : 0.3 g very @entity99 : 170 g , very ripe , medium dice @entity101 : 3 @entity102 : 45 g flour : 14 g @entity105 : 17 g coconut flakes : 28 g orange juice : 113 g cayenne pepper papaya : 128 g , small dice corn oil : for deep frying @entity114 : 1 , very cold @entity37 off beat : while many of the recipes might sound odd , the @entity7 chefs say they 've all tasted delicious @entity118 @entity120 eggplant : 1 kg , about 3 @entity121 : 8 g dried @entity122 : 1 g @entity123 @entity124 : 10 g @entity125 , @entity126 : 6 g @entity37 : 6 g coarsely @entity127 : 100 g @entity128 : 28 g , tops removed , sliced cumin : @entity130 @entity132 @entity131 : 1 g @entity121 : 2 g baguette : 24 thin slices @entity136 flower oil @entity137 : @entity7 anticipates that @entity10 will offer virtually unlimited recipe combinations to amateur and professional chefs alike one day soon @entity17 - @entity140 butter : 5.5 oz , divided water : 2.9 oz , divided @entity101 : 2 , divided @entity37 : 1.5 tsp , divided @entity144 flour : 8 oz , sifted lemongrass : .4 oz , thinly sliced leeks : 4 oz , white part only asparagus tips : 28 , 2.5 " long eggs : 3 heavy cream : 7.5 oz plain whole - milk yogurt : 7.5 oz @entity151 : 3/8 tsp ground coriander seeds : 1/4 tsp @entity153 : 1/8 tsp feta : 2 oz , crumbled @entity155 : 1.5 oz , grated @entity157 : 1/2 tbsp , finely chopped @entity158 - bound : the @entity10 food truck had its debut at a @entity13 tech show last week and it 's next stop will be @entity22 's @entity21 in addition to the billions or trillions of combinations @entity10 can come up with , having the chefs there to decide how to use the ingredients makes for even more possibilities			1
' two different chefs can get the same list of ingredients and come up with completely different dishes , ' @entity58 said			1
the chef is n't afraid of losing his job to the supercomputer , though			0
he tells the @entity37 that sometimes a list of ingredients will have all the best flavors but none of that all - important aspect of a great dish , texture			2
' you can end up with a list of ingredients , and none of them has an element of crispiness , ' he said			0
@entity7 is showing off @entity10 's diverse skill sets as position themselves to make the @entity194 's benefits available to businesses and individuals			2
' @entity197 ' : @entity7 hopes to turn @entity10 's giant computer mind into a repository of trillions of possible recipe combinations you can access from an app the @entity204 , @entity206 company said their new @entity208 - based business unit devoted soley to @entity10 will be dedicated to the development and commercialization of the project that first gained fame by defeating a pair of ‘ @entity4 ! ’ champions , including 74 - time winner @entity215 , in 2011			1
in the years since @entity10 's tv appearance , @entity7 has been developing the supercomputer for more practical purposes and changed it to a cloud - based service			1
its massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room , but @entity10 is now that size of three stacked pizza boxes , according to @entity226			0
@entity7 says @entity10 is unique because it it 's programed like traditional computers and uses artificial intelligence to learn from its past experiences and factor that information into its future operations			1
more practical than @entity4 : @entity7 has been thinking big when it comes to @entity10 and since its 2011 @entity4 win against champs including @entity215 , they 've created a @entity208 - based arm of the company specifically geared toward putting the supercomputer to use for businesses and consumers small but powerful : its massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room , but @entity10 is now that size of three stacked pizza boxes ‘ @entity7 has transformed @entity10 from a quiz - show winner , into a commercial cognitive computing breakthrough that is helping businesses engage customers , healthcare organizations personalize patient care , and entrepreneurs build businesses , ’ said @entity245 , who will head the new @entity246			1
@entity7 ceo @entity255 said that @entity10 is built for a world where big data is transforming every industry and every profession			2
‘ @entity10 does more than find the needle in the haystack , ’ @entity255 said in remarks released ahead of the @entity262 's unveiling			0
‘ it understands the haystack			0
’ as part of its investment , @entity7 is building a new headquarters for the business on the edge of @entity206 's @entity273 near @entity274 and other technology companies			0
about $ 100 million will go toward investing in startup companies that are building apps to be run through @entity10 .			0

@entity7 is now using the computer that beat champion @entity215 to think up unique dishes that are actually served to customers
human chefs first suggest a dish then @entity10 makes trillions of computations based on information it accesses from the cloud
@entity10 considers human taste , and *quintillions* of possible recipes to decide which one is most likely to surprise and impress
the computer then spits out a list of ingredients and chefs whip up the food for eager *patrons*
