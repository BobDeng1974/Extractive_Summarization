@entity0 could announce @entity1 as his long - term coach as early as next week			2
the deposed @entity4 champion met @entity1 on thursday , a day after his meek quarter - final defeat by @entity6 , and wants to finalise arrangements before departing for a training camp in @entity9 at the end of next week			1
but there are still pertinent issues to be ironed about between @entity1 and the rest of @entity0 ’s support team			0
backroom : @entity0 could announce @entity1 as his long - term coach next week support team : @entity0 's coach @entity1 ( right ) and @entity18 at @entity4 fallout : @entity0 's quarter - final exit at @entity4 has led to him having to re-assess his team assistant coach @entity18 was understood to be unhappy about the timing of @entity1 ’s appointment - though not the decision to hire the @entity25 - and even considered ending his four - year stint working with @entity0			1
fitness trainer @entity27 has also been unsettled and wants a clear structure to be established if @entity1 is to continue working with the @entity29			2
both men have sought reassurances about their positions			0
but @entity0 ’s camp insist talks have progressed well , while the intention was always to trial working with @entity1 during the grass - court season before making a more formal , long - term agreement if the pair were happy			0
apart from reassuring some other members of @entity42 there are still several stumbling blocks to overcome			0
pushing himself ? or maybe , the disastrous performance was all down to @entity0 himself ? unsettled : @entity0 ( left ) with conditioning coach @entity27 ( right ) who wants reassurances @entity1 has returned to @entity25 for a holiday and it is unclear whether she would be willing to commit to an four - week block of training with @entity0 in @entity9 before his next tournament in @entity54 from august 6			1
the 35 - year - old must also honour her commitments as captain of the @entity25 @entity59 team , which would take her away from @entity0 for around two months each year .			1
