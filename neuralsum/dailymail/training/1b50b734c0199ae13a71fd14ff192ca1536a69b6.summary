dinosaurs flourished in @entity2 right up until the asteroid impact that wiped them out 66 million years ago , a new study shows			1
while the theory that an asteroid rapidly killed off the dinosaurs is widely recognised , up until recently fossils of the last dinosaurs were found almost exclusively from @entity10			1
the new study brings together a series of studies on @entity2 dinosaurs over the past two decades , which found @entity16 dinosaurs in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , and other countries			1
pictured is the evolution of the @entity2 continental ecosystems around the time dinosaurs went extinct			2
the diverse vertebrates of the latest @entity16 are shown , with dinosaurs in @entity18 , crocodiles in @entity27 and other mammals almost wiped out ( bottom image ) , with a few groups surviving into the @entity31 ( top image ) it claims to address speculation about whether the sudden decline of dinosaurs in the @entity38 and @entity39 west was merely a local story			1
by looking at the variety and ages of these fossils , a team of researchers led by @entity43 of the @entity44 , determined that dinosaurs remained diverse in @entity2 ecosystems very late into the @entity16			1
the @entity16 is known for being the last portion of the ' @entity51 ' and lasted 79 million years , ending 65.5 million years ago			0
in the @entity52 of @entity17 and @entity18 , the best area in @entity2 for finding latest @entity16 dinosaurs , meat and plant - eating species are present and seemingly flourishing during the final few hundred thousand years before the asteroid hit			2
the new study suggests that @entity2 dinosaurs were thriving up to the asteroid impact			1
in this artist 's depiction , a @entity60 ( predator on the left ) attacks a herd of @entity66 during the @entity16 dr @entity43 said ' for a long time , @entity2 was overshadowed by other continents when the understanding of the nature , composition and evolution of latest @entity16 continental ecosystems was concerned			0
' the last 25 years witnessed a huge effort across all @entity2 to improve our knowledge , and now we are on the brink of fathoming the significance of these new discoveries , and of the strange and new story they tell about life at the end of the @entity83			2
' dr @entity84 of the @entity86 's @entity85 , an author on the report , added : ' everyone knows that an asteroid hit 66 million years ago and dinosaurs disappeared , but this story is mostly based on fossils from one part of the world , @entity10			1
' we now know that @entity2 dinosaurs were thriving up to the asteroid impact , just like in @entity10			1
this is strong evidence that the asteroid really did kill off dinosaurs in their prime , all over the world at once			0
' for years scientists have debated whether an asteroid , climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs			0
but last year , a study claimed that the majority of the prehistoric creatures were wiped out by a perfect storm of ‘ colossal bad luck ’			0
dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction if it had come slightly earlier or later in history , scientists said			0
but when the six - mile - wide ( 10km ) asteroid hit what is now @entity122 approximately 66 million years ago , dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval , which left them vulnerable			0
the study by an international team of palaeontologists led by the @entity86 looked at an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils , mostly from @entity10			0
they found that widespread volcanic activity , changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs ’ food chain when disaster struck			0
if the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier , when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust , they may have survived , according to the study .			2

until recently fossils of last dinosaurs were largely found in @entity10
new research brings together separate studies on @entity2 dinosaurs
it found they flourished up until the asteroid impact that wiped them out
it addresses speculation about whether the sudden decline of dinosaurs in the @entity38 and @entity39 west was merely a local story
