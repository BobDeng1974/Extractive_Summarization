speaking out for the first time since the incident 10 months ago , @entity9 , from @entity10 , said that raising their 15 - year - old @entity13 was hard and at one point brought the couple to ' a cracking point , ' but that no parent of an autistic child should ever take such extreme measures			1
' @entity21 did something unspeakable , ' he told @entity24 magazine of his estranged partner , @entity25 , who faces a maximum life sentence for attempted murder , with her trial beginning july 16			1

' she has pleaded not guilty			0
mr @entity9 wrestles with his role in what happened			2
' maybe i could have done more - maybe i should have seen the signs , ' he said			0
@entity13 was diagnosed as autistic at 2 , and barely slept until age 8 when she began taking medication that gave her focus and allowed her parents to rest			1
however , when she became violent towards her classmates her parents were forced to pull her out of school , ' just for the safety of the other kids , ' mr @entity9 said			2
but the attacks continued at home			0
mrs @entity55 was twice left unconscious by @entity13 's fits and her younger sister @entity57 , 13 , hid in her room to avoid outbursts			2
awaiting trial : @entity25 , seen in her mug shot , told police that after years of physical abuse directed at her and other family members , she ' thought this would be the best solution ... if @entity13 and her went to heaven ' mother and child : @entity25 , left , was found alongside her daughter @entity70 , right , just hours after her husband reported them missing and they were both unconscious the father said the family was at a complete loss as to what to do next			1
' if somebody would have called me ( then ) and said this horrible thing had happened , i would not have been okay with it , but i would have understood it , ' he told people			0
but they finally got @entity13 into a residential autism treatment center in january 2013 , which really helped			2
she was calmer and was learning how to control her fiery temper			0
she was at the @entity87 in @entity88 for seven months			0
mrs @entity25 acted just days after @entity13 was released			1

' this is not an okay act for any parent of an autistic child , ' mr @entity9 said			1
doing better : @entity101 ( pictured left ) is now breathing , walking and talking again on her own after her mother @entity21 ( right ) allegedly tried to kill her after 17 years of marriage , mr @entity9 filed for divorce after the alleged crime , partly to show a welfare agency how he 's determined to protect his children			1

and she is thankful , ' mr @entity9 said			0
as for himself , he said : ' i 'm never going to complain about anything for the rest of my life			0
' but , now faced with caring for @entity13 and their other two children alone , he does want to raise awareness of the lack of support there is for autistic kids and their parents			2
