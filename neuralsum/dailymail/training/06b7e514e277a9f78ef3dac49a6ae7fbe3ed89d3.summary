the parents of an @entity2 teen who died from an overdose of caffeine powder are urging federal regulators to ban sales of the stimulant			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity2 , were in @entity11 on tuesday on behalf of their 18 - year - old son @entity12 , who was found dead at home in may after ingesting about 23 times the amount of caffeine found in a typical coffee or soda drink			1
' before may 27 , 2014 , we had never heard of " caffeine powder			0
" now we think about it every day , ' the @entity21 said in a meeting with lawmakers			2
tragic : @entity26 student @entity25 died in may from a caffeine overdose as little as a single teaspoon of the stimulant can be fatal			1
the @entity21 said the @entity30 must do more to keep teens and young adults away from pure powdered caffeine , which is marketed as a dietary supplement primarily on the @entity35 and largely unregulated , unlike caffeine added to soda			1
mrs @entity9 reported she found caffeine powder bags in the family 's home the day @entity12 died - but that she did n't even know he was using it			1
however , she said @entity12 told her he had been taking a ' pre-workout ' mix. in july , the @entity30 cautioned consumers to avoid caffeine powder as it considers possible regulatory action			1
the powder remains available for sale online even as the agency acknowledges it often lacks adequate warning labels and that people can easily take a lethal amount			0
the @entity21 met with sens. @entity57 , @entity58 , and @entity59 , @entity60 , and were joined by @entity61 and @entity62 , the parents of @entity54 , a 24 - year - old @entity55 resident who also died after ingesting caffeine powder			1
' we must do everything we can to get this product off the market and away from children , ' the @entity21 said			0
@entity57 and @entity59 pledged to continue pressing the @entity30 to ban the product and said they will consider legislative action if necessary			2
' while the dangers are not broadly understood , powdered caffeine is widely available online or in stores with little warning or guidance			0
that must stop , ' @entity57 said			0
' while it 's too late to save @entity12 and @entity54 from this dangerous substance , we must act quickly before more lives are lost			2
' lethal : a mere 1/16th of a teaspoon of powdered caffeine can be deadly , according to health officials popular : @entity25 was just days away from graduating from high school when he overdosed on caffeine @entity59 called the stimulant a poison			1
' there ought to be a great big " skull and bones " on it , or it should be banned , ' he said			1
in a statement tuesday , the @entity30 said it was continuing its investigation and noted that since its july warning to consumers , some online retailers have discontinued selling caffeine powder			2
the agency did not indicate how long its review may take or what regulatory action it was considering			0
because caffeine powder is sold as a dietary supplement , it 's not subject to the same federal regulations as certain caffeinated foods			0
users add it to drinks for a pick - me - up before workouts or to control weight gain , but it is almost impossible to measure with common kitchen tools , according to the @entity30			0
a mere 1/16th of a teaspoon can contain about 200 milligrams of caffeine , roughly the equivalent of two large cups of coffee			2
in the case of @entity25 , a wrestler , an autopsy found that he had more than 70 micrograms of caffeine per milliliter of blood in his system , as much as 23 times the amount found in a typical coffee or soda drink , when he died at his home			1
symptoms of caffeine overdose or toxicity include rapid or erratic heartbeat , seizures , vomiting , diarrhea and disorientation			0
@entity9 's parents described the teen , who died days before his high school graduation , as a bright kid who was looking forward to attending the @entity139 to study chemical engineering			2
' it was tragic , ' his mother told senators			0
' he had a busy week and he thought it would n't hurt			0
