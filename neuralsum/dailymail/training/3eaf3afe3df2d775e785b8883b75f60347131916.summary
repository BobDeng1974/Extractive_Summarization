@entity0 refused to be drawn on his future after his 19th consecutive @entity3 appearance came to a heartbreaking end against @entity6 's @entity5			1
@entity0 produced some inspired tennis to race through the opening two sets on @entity10 against a player who had never won a five - set match in his career			1
however , the former @entity15 champion was unable to maintain that level and @entity5 - who admitted to kicking a door to let off some steam after leaving the court following the second set - roared back to secure a 2 - 6 1 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 2 victory in just over three hours			1
veteran @entity0 waves goodbye after crashing out of the @entity3 in @entity22 the former @entity15 champion would not confirm what his future now holds @entity25 tennis fans cheer on their fading hero at @entity27 @entity5 's win over @entity29 in the third round of the @entity31 in 2006 prompted @entity29 to retire , but the 33 - year - old @entity6 said : ' i hope it 's not @entity0 's last match because then i get asked about it all the time			1
he is a great warrior , an unbelievable player , so i hope he continues			0
' asked about his future plans , @entity0 - who won just one grand slam match in 2014 - said : ' i 'll sit down and think about it			1
as i 've said the whole time , i have n't thought about anything			1
' but obviously the @entity42 is the next main thing			0
now that we 've got some guys playing really good tennis at the moment , it 's an exciting time			2
we have a good chance to possibly pull off an upset away ( against the @entity51 in @entity52 )			0
that 's the next focus			2
' earlier in the day , top seed and four - time champion @entity54 lost just five games as he cruised into the third round			1
@entity58 thrashed @entity60 @entity59 6 - 0 6 - 1 6 - 4 in an hour and 24 minutes , with all three singles matches on @entity10 in the afternoon completed so quickly that a men 's doubles match was hastily added to the day schedule			1
the 33 - year - old @entity25 raced to a two sets lead before blowing it against @entity5 @entity0 's wife @entity67 was in the stands to watch what may be her husband 's final match at the @entity3 @entity5 punches the air after completing a remarkable five set comeback @entity54 won the first nine games against a hopelessly outclassed @entity59 , who received a sympathetic cheer when he finally troubled the scorers in the fourth game of the second set			1
the former @entity15 boys ' champion at least had the temerity to break @entity54 at the start of the third , but normal service was instantly resumed and @entity54 closed out the match in ruthless fashion			0
' after my first - round match i was hoping to have this kind of performance , especially the opening two sets , ' @entity54 said			1
' everything went as i planned and wished and hopefully i can stay on this path			0
' ( @entity59 ) is a very talented player			0
he 's still young and he 's of the generation of my younger brother ( @entity93 ) who knows him well , so i spoke to him because i had not seen @entity59 play a lot			2
' @entity54 has dropped just two sets over the first and second rounds since 2007 , winning his first title at @entity27 in 2008 and lifting the trophy three years in succession from 2011			2
' generally this is my most successful grand slam and the tournament where over the years i 've performed my best tennis , ' the 27 - year - old said			1
' the reason ? i think there is not one reason			0
@entity29 cries as he announces his retirement after losing to @entity5 at the 2006 @entity31 @entity109 1 @entity54 breezed into the next round for the loss of just five games @entity60 @entity59 could not cope with @entity54 's superiority on centre court ' probably the fact that i enjoy the conditions of play			1
even though the last two years the courts have played faster , significantly faster than they were before , still i do enjoy being here in @entity25			0
some nice , positive , easy - going , sport - oriented energy going around			2
people appreciate the sport and make you feel good			0
' of course it 's the beginning of the year			1
it 's the first big tournament			2
everybody comes fresh and motivated			0
i guess in this kind of package it 's a combination of things that make me feel comfortable on the court here			2
' defending champion @entity132 , who ended @entity54 's 25 - match unbeaten run here in the quarter - finals last year , also safely reached the last 32 , but needed two hours and 16 minutes to finally subdue the resistance of @entity139 qualifier @entity137			1
the first two sets took longer to complete than @entity54 's entire match as they lasted an hour and 35 minutes , with @entity132 winning both in tie - breaks before taking the third set 6 - 3			1
' it was quite a tough match , ' fourth seed @entity132 said			0
' i 'm happy to get through , especially in three sets			2
@entity54 's coach and former @entity3 champ @entity148 applauds his charge from the sidelines defending champion @entity132 was forced to work before coming through againstqualifier @entity137 ' the conditions were n't easy today			1
really fast on the court			0
and he was playing great			0
he was serving big , putting lots of pressure			0
i was n't playing my best tennis , but i 'm happy the way i fight today and the way i did with the match			2
' i 'm happy with my game in general			0
to win the two first matches in three sets , it 's great			1
i 'm playing great tennis			0
as i say , if you want to get far in the tournament , it can be two long weeks			0
so you need to be ready to have some ups and downs			0
so far it 's been good tennis			0
' @entity132 will face @entity174 in the third round after the @entity176 defeated @entity6 qualifier @entity177 in straight sets , with fifth seed @entity179 taking on @entity182 @entity181 after coming from a set down to beat @entity185 's @entity184 .			1

@entity0 lost to @entity5 in five sets at the @entity3
the 33 - year - old former @entity190 winner would n't be drawn on his future
@entity5 's win over @entity29 at 2006 @entity31 prompted his retirement
