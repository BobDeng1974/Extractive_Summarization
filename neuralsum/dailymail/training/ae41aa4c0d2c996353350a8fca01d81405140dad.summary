somewhere on a film studio ’s cutting room floor is a six - minute scene showcasing the hitherto unheard and unappreciated opera - singing talents of @entity4 , sir @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			1
their rendering of a song from @entity13 ’s @entity12 was to have been the climax of their new film , quartet , but director @entity18 decided to scrap it — much to the relief of all concerned — because , as @entity7 puts it : ‘ let ’s face it , we were n’t very good			1
’ and @entity5 adds : ‘ the film is better without our singing			1
the irony is that all the extras in the film were real opera singers			1
any of them could have sung perfectly well while we mimed			2
’ @entity18 and the @entity4 : director @entity18 and his leading lady @entity4 at the @entity33 premiere of quartet @entity18 — making his full debut as a director at the age of 75 — says : ‘ it was all huge fun , and none of us took ourselves at all seriously			1
i have never enjoyed myself so much			2
’ the story centres on four elderly opera singers — played by @entity4 , 78 today , at her @entity43 - style best ; @entity44 , 75 ; @entity45 72 ; and @entity7 , 70 — living out their twilight years in a retirement home for musicians , @entity50 , named after the celebrated @entity52 conductor sir @entity51			1
they ’re troubled by dementia , creaky joints , terminal tetchiness and bittersweet memories of the past			2
@entity4 and @entity44 ’s characters , @entity60 and @entity61 , were briefly married , which does n’t help matters			1
‘ all i want is nothing more than a dignified senility , ’ complains @entity64 @entity61 sneers at having to spend the rest of her days in a home associated with @entity70			2
‘ his father made laxatives , ’ she says			2
‘ seems rather apt for a nursing home			2
’ the four are being persuaded to sing together in a fundraiser , organised by the pompous @entity77 , played by another septuagenarian , sir @entity79 , 72			2
resting voice : @entity7 plays a retired opera singer in @entity18 's quartet which hits the cinema on @entity84 @entity18 had long wanted to direct a movie			1
his first attempt was in 1978 , with @entity87 , in which he also played the leading role of a newly released criminal			2
‘ i got very confused with both jobs , so i fired myself from directing to concentrate on the acting , ’ he says			1
‘ i was so traumatised that it ’s taken me nearly 35 years , and almost the rest of my life , to get back in the director ’s chair			2
’ quartet had been in the planning stages for some time and already had a director , and a leading actor in @entity102 , but they dropped out and the script was sent to @entity18			1
before filming , he had to tackle one major problem			2
as an actor , he has a fearsome reputation for standing no nonsense from directors ; so has @entity4			1
was he scared of her ? ‘ i ’d been forewarned that she can destroy you if you bull * * * * her , and i promised myself i certainly would n’t do that			0
‘ when we met , we sat on a couch and i said : “ i think we have the same reputation for being hard on directors			0
” and she said : “ some			0
” i told her : “ yes , i can say the same thing			0
” and she was brilliant			0
‘ mind you , she was the biggest diva of us all , ’ he jokes			0
‘ while we all had a two - hour commute every day between @entity123 and where we were shooting in @entity124 , she managed to bag herself a house less than ten minutes away from the set			0
’ dame @entity4 is up for a @entity128 next month for best actress in @entity97 , and so the idea of another hit film about @entity132 is very welcome			1
having starred in @entity133 , about a group of @entity52 seniors who settle in @entity135 , which was well received by audiences and critics ( she ’s been nominated for @entity139 awards for it and @entity43 ) , she ’s hoping it ’s the start of a new trend			0
‘ there have n’t been many films made about the elderly , yet the ones that have been done have all been very successful , ’ she says			0
this is all good for @entity4 , as she ’s normally the first in the queue to be offered such parts			1
‘ i do n’t know why i ’ve always been cast as an old lady — but i ’m not complaining , ’ she says			0
‘ i ’m all too aware that this is a very tough business and my advice to anyone looking to come into acting is “ try not to cry too much ” , because it is hard and can be heartbreaking			0
so , to have worked as much as i have , in any role , is a real privilege			0
’ always the lady : dame @entity4 , seen as @entity161 lady @entity161 on @entity43 , said she does not mind being typecast as an old lady with @entity4 and sir @entity5 already cast , @entity18 had to find two more actors to play the other members of the quartet , @entity167 and @entity168			1
‘ i asked @entity4 who should play @entity168 , and without missing a beat , she said @entity6			1
’ @entity18 had not seen @entity171 or anything else @entity6 had appeared in , so he watched her in @entity174 ’s @entity173 and was suitably impressed			1
but there were a few cultural differences to overcome			0
‘ i do n’t think he really understood me at the beginning , ’ says @entity6 , who rose to fame as parlour maid @entity179			0
‘ i remarked that , unlike @entity4 , i seemed to have spent my career “ downstairs ” , meaning that i was always playing parts under the stairs			1
‘ but he took it to mean i was always billed below the title , and he said : “ after this film , you wo n’t be any more			2
” it took a while , but we totally get each other now			0
’ @entity6 ’s character , @entity168 , has vascular dementia			0
she says @entity18 gave her free rein to interpret the role how she liked and she partly based it on her mother , who had dementia			1
‘ he is a dynamo and one of the kindest and most inspiring directors i ’ve ever worked for , ’ she says			0
@entity7 jokes : ‘ on the other hand , i found him to be a complete nightmare			0
he threw tantrums , we had to endure long silences and he has a habit of touching you inappropriately			0
’ @entity18 had long been a regular at @entity7 ’s stand - up gigs , so the two of them were friends			1
‘ when @entity18 asked me to join the cast and he reeled off all the other names , i thought : “ oh , @entity219 , i ca n’t do it , ” ’ says @entity7			1
‘ but i thought about it and remembered how much i ’d enjoyed working with another big name — @entity223 , in @entity225			0
that brought out the best in me , so i told myself not to be a coward and i hoped @entity4 and the rest would do the same for me in quartet			1
’ @entity18 laughs as @entity7 goes on to explain how he found playing the tactless , over-sexed yet loveable @entity167			1
‘ @entity18 let me throw in my own ad - libs , which is generous			1
‘ it worked for me because i think people get to a certain age and feel they ’re finally able to say what they want			0
’ @entity18 says he never had any doubts about the film ’s box - office potential			1
‘ quartet is no different from a film about dancers or athletes in that it ’s about having an extraordinary gift that goes and then no one wants you any more			1
it looks at people who become invisible because of age			0
‘ every member of the supporting cast really is a retired musician or singer , whose phone stopped ringing with offers of work a long time ago , even though they can still deliver			0
‘ these guys are 70 , 80 , 90 years old , yet as soon as they arrived on set , they brought such energy and verve we all felt it			0
directing the film did n’t seem like a job and i do n’t know if i ’ll ever feel like that again			1
‘ life is a game with @entity266 , ’ he says , pointing to the skies			0
‘ it ’s like saying : “ do n’t be so sure that you ’re gon na stop me			0
” to me , that ’s what this film is all about			2
’ quartet opens nationwide on @entity84 .			2
