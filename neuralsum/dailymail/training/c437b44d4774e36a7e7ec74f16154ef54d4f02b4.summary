having already attracted more than four million visitors , the @entity2 poppies looked set to cause chaos for police on the last day of the half - term break yesterday			1
on friday , officials even urged the public not to visit amid fears of an unseemly and dangerous crush			2
in the event , however , they need n’t have worried			2
for while their pleas fell on deaf ears , those who turned out in their tens of thousands were a picture of dignity			1
determined : thousands of visitors flocked to the @entity2 ’s poppy display today despite calls from organisers to cancel weekend visits because of overcrowding waiting : visitors queue for the installation , with lines of people stretching on to @entity27 as far as the eye can see dedicated : crowds queue around the moat to get a glimpse of the sea of scarlet on the display 's penultimate weekend as the rain poured , orderly queues eight - deep huddled under umbrellas not just around the @entity27 itself but in a line across @entity27			1
come november 11 , @entity41 , there will be 888,246 ceramic poppies in the @entity2 ’s mighty moat – one for each of the @entity46 and @entity47 soldiers , sailors and airmen who perished in the @entity50			1
volunteers will start to take them away the day after november 11 and perhaps this is the reason why so many felt the weekend provided their only opportunity to glimpse the art installation – called @entity57			1
one mother said she had braved the rain because her six - year - old daughter , @entity60 , was determined to see the poppies			2
@entity62 , 25 , from @entity63 , @entity64 , said : ‘ she really wanted to come … she said she really cared about it			0
' it ’s important for children to know			0
my great great grandfather fought in the war and i was telling her about it when we were walking round			0
’ nearing the end : the @entity76 installation will be finished on @entity77 , november 11 success : up to four million people from around the world have now visited the exhibition at the @entity2 congestion : officials from @entity84 , which manages the exhibition , warned that saturday and sunday would be be exceptionally busy visitors crowd around the moat 's perimeter despite the weather taking a turn for the worse with strong winds and rain in @entity64 today contrast : the @entity2 , first built in the 11th century , is surrounded by a sea of scarlet poppies in the shadow of the @entity96 - which became @entity99 's tallest building when it was completed in 2012 ( picture taken thursday ) powerful : @entity101 's @entity57 and @entity76 installation lies before an illuminated @entity27 on thursday another family had travelled from @entity104 on saturday night to be at the @entity27 first thing on sunday			1
@entity106 , 75 , said : ‘ it ’s amazing			0
when we arrived it was teeming with people – we were n’t aware it was half term			2
my dad was in the @entity50			1
’ his wife @entity113 , 71 , added : ‘ my grandad was gassed in the @entity50 so it ’s something very close to us			1
’ @entity116 , 37 , from @entity117 brought her parents @entity118 and @entity120 , 70 , to see the poppies			0
it took the family three hours to reach @entity64 yesterday			0
mrs @entity124 , 64 , said : ‘ i ’ve never seen so many people … it ’s really lovely and a very nice tribute			1
it ’s something that ’s not going to be here much longer			0
my grandad was killed in the @entity50 so we ’ve been thinking about it			1
’ officials from @entity84 , which manages the exhibition , had asked those planning to visit the poppies at the weekend to ‘ postpone their visit ’ until after half term			1
the situation was n’t helped by the closure of @entity140 yesterday , but the crowds remained calm and accepted that to visit such a stunning tribute would demand a little patience			2
meticulous : around 8,000 volunteers have been working on the powerful exhibition at the tower over the last four months journey : the poignant tribute in the tower 's moat has come a long way since work originally started on it back in the summer ( above ) each poppy is handmade and carefully shaped by a team of workers in @entity159 each poppy is handmade and individually shaped by a team of local workers in @entity159 , making each poppy unique			1
@entity164 is sliced by hand and rolled into large flat sheets and a metal stamp , much like a large biscuit cutter , carves out petal patterns			0
they are then paired together by hand to form six overlapping petals			0
the petals are individually moulded to create the shape of the flower and fired to fix their position			0
the bright red glaze is applied to the fired poppies before they are returned to the kiln for the second and final firing			0
ceramic artist @entity101 , who came up with the idea , has had a team working on the project since january			0
he said : ' i was inspired to create this installation after reading a living will by an unknown soldier who we think may have been from @entity159			2
i approached the @entity27 as the ideal setting as its strong military links seemed to resonate			1
' the installation is transient , i found this poignant and reflective of human life , like those who lost their lives during @entity50			1
i wanted to find a fitting way to remember them '			0
he came up with the idea of creating a ' sea ' of poppies two years and was delighted when the @entity2 decided to bring his idea to life with the help of set designer @entity205			0
the artist has experience of working with historic buildings and over the last three years he has been commissioned to create large - scale installations for the @entity211 's @entity210 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 .			2

officials from @entity84 , which manages exhibition , were *encouraging* people to postpone weekend visits
warning was issued on @entity222 as a result of *mounting* congestion around the site and @entity226 closing nearest tube station
but today thousands more turned up to installation with queues *snaking* around moat and back on to @entity27
more than four million people have already visited the @entity50 tribute - which will raise *£* *11.2million* for *charity*
