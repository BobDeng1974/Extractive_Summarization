' [ i was required to be ] somewhat presentable ... not embarrass the institution , ' she said , gesturing overtly at ms @entity1 , before adding that she was ' reprimanded very early on ' by the fierce editor			1
game tactics : ms @entity1 revealed her tactics to fend off an awkward embrace , step back and say ' how do you do ? ' instead fashion chums : viewers got the rare chance so see a more playful side of the revered editor , who joked merrily with ms @entity9 throughout the interview ' she talks too much ! ' exclaimed ms @entity1 , quickly cutting in and explaining that guests arriving at the event were quick to ' rush away ' from her after a brief handshake , but stuck around to chat with the ' polite ' ms @entity9			1
the actress , who looked ravishing in a yellow floral dress and turquoise cardigan , marveled at ms @entity1 's ability to keep greetings brief			2
' she offers a hospitable hand , and without any words is able to communicate that that 's all that will happen , ' she relayed , adding that the dramatic white gloves she wore for the evening were filthy in the ' sober light ' of morning , from all the handshakes she too had exchanged			0

' ' it was the chicest collapse i 'd ever seen ! ' she joked			0
the pair also discussed ms @entity1 's choice of dress code this year , which was ' white tie and diamonds ' - a theme she picked to ' turn the tables ' and make it harder for men who usually only have to have to come in a black tux			1
' i had no idea how much panic it would create ! ' she admits , adding that designer @entity113 received ' hundreds ' of emails from men trying to clarify what they should wear			0

' @entity130 was mocked for his ' white tropical ' dinner jacket , mr @entity11 was scolded for not having ' tails ' , @entity129 was declared ' almost perfect ' and @entity133 stole the show in the discerning eyes of ms @entity1			1
