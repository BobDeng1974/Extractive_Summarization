some people think of the @entity1 of just jam and @entity3			0
but as the @entity5 celebrates its 100th anniversary , a new book has been published which offers an insight into the history and politics behind the famous @entity11 organisation			1
@entity13 ' book , @entity14 : a @entity15 , has studied the suffragists who made the @entity5 one of the most important movements for women in the 20th century			1
the first @entity5 meeting in the @entity11 was held in @entity37 , north @entity38 , on september 16 , 1915 as a way to encourage women to become more involved in producing food during the @entity42			1
but it went on to spearhead campaigns to improve living conditions and the environment , tackle unemployment , get free family planning , more nursery education for children and even world peace			2
the movement grew rapidly and now has 212,000 members in about 6,600 groups			0
they have raised many millions of pounds for charity over the last century			0
it gave bored middle - class women an outlet for their organisational skills and the opportunity to practice public speaking while providing working - class countrywomen with the chance to see more of the wider world around them			2
@entity66 ( left ) of @entity67 and @entity5 came up with the idea of posing naked for a calendar to raise money for charity			1
right , @entity72 , of the same @entity5 , also strikes a pose even the @entity74 was a member of the @entity5			1
mrs @entity13 started researching her book after moving to rural @entity76 in 2004 and joining the local @entity5			1
after writing an article about @entity5 banners , she became interested in the movement and interviewed people from @entity5 groups around the country , collecting stories and nostalgic photographs			1
the black and white pictures capture classic images associated with the @entity5 , including a young queen mother watching a chair caning demonstration , a group preparing fruit for jam making and women waving off a horse and cart after a course on caravanning			1
queen elizabeth , the queen mother , a member of the @entity5 , watches a chair caning demonstration in 1938 @entity100 , chair of the first @entity5 , and , right , the new book marking 100 years of the organisation the book covers the very beginnings of the movement right through to modern women like the @entity108 making their mark			1
' it 's not always easy to discover what women have achieved , ' said mrs @entity13			2
' in the 19th and into the 20th century , women 's influence was often exercised through the men in their lives and women 's groups have had a similarly low profile			1
' she said she was surprised to discover the real political movement behind the organisation			2
the first organisers were ex-suffragists who felt that now women had the vote , they needed an education to give them the confidence to make their mark on the world that was opening up to them			2
women collect fruit and vegetables ready to make chutney during the war @entity137 , wife of the @entity139 president @entity138 , talks to a member of @entity141 in 1942 she said : ' when i started looking into it i was surprised that a lot of the people who started the @entity5 were suffragists			1
' they gave the @entity5 a political twist , using it to educate women in citizenship , give them a new role in society , and that really grabbed me			1
' it was about valuing women 's work in the home and because it valued the work they did , they could take time away from the home to increase their skills			2
' it improved their lives and opened them up to the outside world			2
' her book explores key figures in the movement , like @entity169 , the @entity5 's first formidable chairman and her vice-chairman @entity171 , as well as pivotal changing points , like when the @entity173 was introduced			1
' the @entity5 had been trying to influence politics all through the 1920s and 30s			1
they were working all the time to improve living conditions and battle deprivation			0
' but the introduction of the @entity173 took those goals away from them - they were no longer needed to do things like raise money for the local hospital			0
' so they began looking at the environment and started the @entity188 campaign			0
they worked with other groups to improve the world			0
' the @entity5 reached its peak in the 1980s when it had more than 9,000 groups around the country , although it was viewed by the general public as being old - fashioned and insignificant			1
members of @entity197 set up their market stall in the 1940s a @entity5 working party making fur coats from rabbit skins for the people of @entity204 in 1944 in 1999 a group of women from @entity67 and @entity5 in @entity207 changed that when they turned a personal tragedy into a collective triumph			1
they produced a nude calendar of some of the members to raise money for a sofa at the hospital where one of the member 's husbands was being treated for leukaemia			0
their success was completely unprecedented and their ' alternative @entity5 calendar ' went on to raise £ 3 million for @entity225 and @entity226			1
the ' @entity108 ' spawned a successful film and play and inspired other groups , sports teams and organisations to make their own nude charity calendars			0
mrs @entity13 said : ' @entity232 rejuvenated everything			0
they overturned the idea of the @entity5 as an old fashioned collection of elderly ladies who made jam and sang @entity3			1
' after that the @entity5 got more young groups			2
there has been a renewed interest in the organisation			0
' the @entity5 still promotes the home skills it taught when it first started - holding lectures , demonstrations and workshops on all sorts of activities			2
the end of a caravan course at @entity251 in 1948 a group prepares fruit for jam making spindle - spinning wool gathered from the hedges in @entity257 during the @entity258 ' i 've just done @entity261 patchwork for the first time and soon i 'll be learning how to paint blown eggs , ' added mrs @entity13			0
' it 's such fun and it 's so out of the norm of what i usually do			0
' however , the @entity5 also still tackles bigger issues too - violence against women , the environment , health and justice			1
' it 's a really nice organisation , everyone looks after one another			0
' but they 're very modest , they 're not very good at telling people outside the organisation how much they do			0
' i think it has to work on what it 's always worked on - valuing women for who they are			0
' i think one of the newer , younger members i spoke to summed it up perfectly			0
' she said " it 's really nice to feel part of a body of women of all ages who have contributed so much to improving life for women "			0
we want that to carry on			0
' the book is available from @entity298 and is priced at £ 20 .			0
