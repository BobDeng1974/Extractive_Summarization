lucky escape : a @entity11 man who was searching for his laptop in a rubbish skip was tipped into the back of a dustbin lorry ( file picture ) but because of the steep sides inside the lorry , the man was unable to climb out and the fire brigade had to be called to rescue him with a ladder			1
the man told his rescuers that he had climbed into the rubbish skip to look for his laptop computer , which he had believed was in there			1
his explanation baffled his rescuers because the incident had occurred at 4.30 in the morning			2
while he was in the skip , he said , he realised it was suddenly being lifted up and he , along with piles of rubbish , was dumped into the rear of the compactor truck			2
police said later that on investigating screams , the driver found the distressed man among waste that was due to be crushed			0
a fire brigade spokesman confirmed that the man had escaped uninjured			0
but his rescuers agreed that psychologically he had received a terrifying blow he would never want repeated .			0
