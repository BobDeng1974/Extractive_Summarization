a tough fortnight for the @entity1 ended in the best possible way on sunday , with a convincing win over the @entity4 at @entity5			1
after two straight defeats by @entity7 and @entity8 , injury problems for quarterback @entity10 and suggestions that a number of players ‘ missed curfew ’ on friday , the @entity1 were back to winning ways			1
@entity17 ’ big players all showed up in @entity18 to lead them to a dominant 31 - 17 victory over @entity4 in the third and final @entity22 contest this season			1
‘ @entity10 played a really good game , ’ head coach @entity43 said			1
‘ he saw the field well and took the opportunity to throw the ball down the field			0
he did n’t look like he had any physical restrictions			0
’ @entity10 added : ‘ i ’m just sore , but it ’s always uncomfortable when you get hit			2
it ’s part of playing football and everyone goes through that			0
i ’m a little bang up , but a lot of guys are			0
‘ we had to win this game and came out with great energy and executed really well			2
’ running back @entity61 continued his strong season with yet another 100 - yard rushing game while wide receiver @entity31 racked up 158 yards and two touchdowns			1
it was a victory that ended a two - game losing streak for @entity17 and kept up the pressure on @entity69 leaders @entity70 having relinquished control of that division			0
if the @entity1 are serious about their play - off hopes , this was a game they could barely afford to lose against a @entity4 team who have won just once this season			1
@entity43 said : ‘ the big challenge is to focus on the task in hand regardless of what happened the previous week			0
‘ i thought we did a good job of that and had the right approach , mentality and mindset and it reflected in our performance today			0
’ @entity91 ’s 32 - yard touchdown run for the @entity4 midway through the first quarter would have had the @entity1 sideline anxiously biting their nails at the prospect of a third straight defeat			1
but once the tide turned in @entity17 ’ favour , it never looked like shifting back again			0
@entity4 running back @entity91 ( right ) breaks away from @entity1 cornerback @entity100 quarterback @entity10 ( second right ) calls a play to his team - mates during the second half of the game @entity91 ( centre ) is hauled down by the @entity1 defence during the @entity107 week 10 match at @entity5 @entity1 wide receiver @entity109 ( right ) makes a catch under pressure from a @entity4 player as his team looks on from the touchline @entity4 ’s promising start was undone by a costly mistake on special teams when @entity118 made a mess of his punt return			1
@entity118 dropped the ball on his six - yard line , and @entity17 recovered in excellent field position			0
on 3rd and goal , @entity10 took his time and rolled right before finding a wide - open tight end @entity126 in the end zone			1
once @entity130 settled down and found their groove , the @entity129 defense could n’t stop them			0
@entity31 helped himself to a pair of touchdowns in the first half , the first time he has recorded multiple scores this season			0
the first came on a 35 - yard pass from @entity10 with 7:01 remaining in the second quarter , but the second was even bigger			1
with 19 seconds to play in the first half , @entity31 caught a deep pass from @entity10 and bounced off tackles before marching all the way to the end zone for a 68 - yard reception			2
it gave @entity17 a 24 - 7 half - time lead , and it was an advantage that @entity4 never threatened to close			2
@entity149 throws himself over an opponent to score a touchdown @entity152 makes an amazing catch during @entity17 ' victory over the @entity4 @entity155 ( centre ) is not quite quick enough as he is clipped by the diving @entity1 defensive back @entity158 ( left ) the @entity4 squad emerges from the tunnel ready for battle in front of an electrified crowd at the sold out @entity5 @entity1 running back @entity149 hammered another nail in the @entity129 coffin early in the third period as he scored on a 40 - yard touchdown run with his first rush of the game			1
@entity4 ’s desperation was best demonstrated when they attempted to run the ball on 4th and 1 deep in their own territory and came up short			0
as was the case last year against the @entity175 , the @entity129 were simply outplayed on the night by a better team			0
rookie quarterback @entity177 threw for 290 yards but no touchdowns			1
he almost went a game without throwing an interception until he threw straight into the open arms of @entity1 linebacker @entity182 in the fourth period taking his total for the season to 14			1
@entity4 will return to @entity186 shores once again in 2015 to take on the @entity187 and hope for better luck them			0
@entity91 ’s second touchdown run of night late in the fourth quarter gave the scoreboard a bit more respectability for the @entity129			0
with just over six minutes to play and fans heading for an early exit , @entity10 took a seat on the bench as @entity17 ’ backup quarterback @entity198 stepped in for the final few plays			2
the @entity1 know that tougher tests await them following their bye week , including two games against division rivals @entity70			2
a win against the @entity4 was all that mattered here , though , and it was a job well done			2
@entity1 quarterback @entity10 gets ready for action before the @entity107 football game against the @entity4 the armed forces lead the way in observing a minute 's silence in front of a capacity crowd at @entity5 on sunday evening @entity18 mayor @entity215 welcomed the @entity107 fans to the nation 's capital by getting involved in the pre-match coin toss @entity1 owner @entity220 is all smiles as he greets @entity223 manager and @entity107 fan @entity224 @entity225 ( left ) performs under a shower of red poppies and @entity228 ( right ) sings the @entity186 national anthem before kick off the @entity4 cheerleaders turn a few heads as they arrive during the @entity232 outside @entity5 the @entity4 cheerleaders prepare to dazzle as they look out of the @entity5 tunnel at the eagerly awaiting capacity crowd not to be outdone , the @entity1 cheerleaders throw some shapes as they perform a routine during the @entity232 a starry - eyed @entity1 fan shows where her allegiances lie as she holds up a banner in support for her team a sea of american football fans floods along @entity246 as they head towards the stadium from @entity249 station two @entity4 fans are dressed to impress in full kit as they enjoy the lead up to the game under the iconic @entity5 arch a @entity1 fan holds up the @entity256 as @entity257 welcomes one of @entity260 's most popular sports to its national stadium a group of @entity1 supporters arrive in full force whilst sporting their stetsons on a chilly afternoon in the @entity267 capital two @entity4 fans wear their colours with pride after dusting off these weird and wonderful hats to show their support for their team one clearly overly safety conscious @entity1 fan wears a giant motorcycle helmet printed with the @entity278 flag two visitors from across the pond tell us just how much they paid for their round - trip to see their team play at @entity5			1
