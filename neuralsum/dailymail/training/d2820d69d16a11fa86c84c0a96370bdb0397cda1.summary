by @entity1 correspondent more than 7,000 homeowners have banned the @entity4 ’s tv licence fee enforcers from visiting them			1
as mps prepare to vote tomorrow on plans to decriminalise non-payment , it emerged last night that growing numbers are taking advantage of a legal loophole			1
any homeowner can legally remove the ‘ implied right of access ’ to their front doorstep , effectively threatening to sue licence fee collectors for trespass if they continue to visit			1
around 7,00 homeowners have removed the ' implied right of access ' to their front doorstep , allowing them to sue tv licence collectors if they continue to visit ( file pic ) between february 2012 and january this year , 5,726 people contacted the @entity4 to do so , a @entity23 request has revealed			1
up to december 2011 , just 1,573 people had withdrawn the right of access , so there has been a huge jump in the past two years			0
in total , 7,299 households have now withdrawn access			0
although they are officially named ‘ enforcement officers ’ , tv licensing staff – who are employed by private firm @entity37 on the @entity4 ’s behalf – do not possess any official powers of arrest and can not enter homes or search property without permission			2
the 334 staff make four million home visits a year to gather evidence of licence fee evasion , leading to around 180,000 prosecutions			2
however , homeowners have complained of being harassed even when they do not own a tv , while letters have been sent to the families of viewers who are long dead			0
@entity54 , 28 , has said she was ‘ hounded by tv licence people ’ even though she did not own a tv			0
under @entity4 policy , all requests to remove the right of access are honoured as enforcers would be trespassing if they kept visiting			1
tomorrow ’s debate will see mps consider an amendment to the @entity63 which would decriminalise non-payment of the fee in 2016			0
@entity66 has backed the plans , put forward by @entity69 mp @entity68 after a petition was signed by 150 mps from each of the three main political parties			0
@entity71 are to vote tomorrow on whether to decriminalise non-payment			0
last year 180,000 people went to court for the crime , and 70 ended up in jail last night mr @entity68 said homeowners withdrawing access shows growing anger towards the @entity4 : ‘ it is clear that a large proportion of the public resent the @entity4 ’s heavy - handed way of collecting the fee			1
’ @entity88 , of the @entity89 ’ @entity87 , said : ‘ the fact that increasing numbers are using their right to withdraw access to tv licensing officials is further evidence that the days of the licence fee appear increasingly numbered			1
’ a tv licensing spokesman said it uses ‘ other forms of detection ’ when right of access is withdrawn			0
he said any complaints about staff are thoroughly investigated			0
@entity4 programmes could be blocked for those who do n't pay the licence fee under new rules being considered ministers are thought to be considering plans to block access to @entity4 programmes for licence fee cheats			1
if laws are passed to decriminalise fee evasion , the corporation will seek new powers to enforce payment			0
senior @entity4 officials have repeatedly warned that removing the threat of jail could see evasion rates rise by 5 per cent , leading to losses of around £ 200million a year			2
one way to stop fee dodgers would be to cut off tv signals from those who fail to pay , in the same way as @entity129 or @entity130 subscribers lose access			1
since the digital switchover , it is possible to encrypt tv programmes so they can only be watched through sets equipped with smart cards			0
however , the @entity4 claims it would be prohibitively expensive to upgrade set - top boxes around the country with the new technology			2
at present , most viewers watch @entity4 shows through @entity142 boxes , which do not have such systems installed			2
@entity4 strategy chief @entity144 said : ‘ we think the cost of running the subscription system would be greater than the licence fee system			1

legal loophole allows licence fee dodgers to beat @entity4 enforcers
*customers* can remove ' implied right of access ' from their doorstep
this allows them to sue collectors for trespass if they repeatedly visit
so far more than 7,000 homeowners are thought to have used the trick
