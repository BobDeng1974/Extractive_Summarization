by @entity1 reporter a team of researchers has discovered evidence that an planet may be forming quite far from its star - and much further than has been seen before			1
astronomers using @entity9 ’s @entity8 say they have discovered evidence of a planet forming 7.5 billion miles away from its host star - about twice the distance @entity14 is from our @entity15 planet formation far away from a small parent star goes against conventional planet - making wisdom			1
somewhere out there : an image of @entity23 and the planet - making stuff surrounding the star			1
astronomers believe a planet is forming within the gas and dust and sweeping up debris , as shown by the gap in this picture in a galaxy far , far away : the new findings could reveal a little bit more about planets in far off galaxies usually , planets form over tens of millions of years from the slow gathering of dust , rocks , and gas but it normally happens closer to a central star , like our sun. planets begin to form when a cloud of debris and gas swirl around a star			2
gradually the bits and pieces start colliding , sticking together and growing bigger into small rocks , bigger ones and eventually , planets or gas giant planet cores			0
the planet lies inside a dusty , gaseous disk around a small red dwarf @entity23 , which is only about 55 percent of the mass of the @entity15 the discovery adds to the ever - increasing variety of planetary systems in the @entity66			1
breaking the norm : usually planets form when they 're close to a mother star , but on this occasion a planet that is twice as far as @entity14 is from our sun is beginning to form planets are thought to form over tens of millions of years			1
a planet 7.5 billion miles from its star should take more than 200 times longer to form than @entity77 did , which is at a distance of 500 million from the sun. however , what complicates the story more is the fact that @entity23 is just 8 million years old and is only 55 percent as massive as our sun. this dusty protoplanetary disk is the closest one to us , some 176 light - years away in the constellation @entity88			2
@entity8 was observing the area to understand not only whether planets have formed , but also what conditions can result in planet formation and what chemical constituents are available for new planets			1
out of this world : we 're learning a little bit more about alien worlds and how they 're created			0
scientists have discovered evidence that an extrasolar planet may be forming quite far from its star lead author of the study , @entity105 of the @entity106 remarked , ' typically , you need pebbles before you can form a planet			2
so , if there is a planet in the gap and there is no dust larger than a grain of sand farther out , we have provided a challenge for traditional planet formation models			2
' coauthor @entity121 of the @entity122 and principal investigator of the observations said it is surprising to find a planet only five to 10 percent of @entity77 ’s mass forming so far out since planets should form faster closer in			0
she said it is difficult to make a low - mass planet far away from a low mass star			0
' if the mass of this suspected planet is as low as it seems to be , this presents a real puzzle			0
theory would say that it can not exist , ' said @entity122 astrophysicist @entity137			0
the research is published in the @entity139 .			0

new planet being formed twice as far as @entity14 is from our @entity15
formation of new worlds so far away from mother star is at odds with *current* scientific thinking
