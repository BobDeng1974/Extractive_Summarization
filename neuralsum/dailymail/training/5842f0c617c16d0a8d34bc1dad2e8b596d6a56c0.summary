the @entity1 consortium seeking boardroom change at @entity3 were no closer on saturday to discovering what agreement — if any — might be struck with the current regime in a deal for acceptance of their £ 6.5million funding rescue package			1
as wealthy @entity3 - minded businessmen @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 wait and hope for a resolution in the coming days amid gravely uncertain times for the club , there remains mystery , too , concerning the involvement of the football man linked to their push for change			1
@entity25 , the former @entity26 and @entity27 manager , was in @entity28 over a week ago for discussions with a representative of the group and it has been revealed that the 61 - year - old is keen to adopt a technical director - style role			1
@entity25 purchased a one per cent stake in finacially troubled @entity3 last week one friend and former colleague is convinced that a man of @entity25 ’s stature , talent and knowledge would be a brilliant asset to @entity3			1
nevertheless , he is baffled by the development that the @entity45 would consider turning his back on management to seek such a role at a @entity50 club where finances are tight and entirely unpredictable			2
@entity52 was a team - mate of @entity25 at @entity53 in the 1980s and their relationship has continued throughout their coaching careers nearly 30 years on			1
@entity52 has recruited players on the recommendation of the @entity45 , most recently at @entity60 , and the pair met up again to talk football when @entity63 played a friendly against @entity65 at @entity27 ’s @entity67 stadium last summer			2
the @entity63 assistant manager was linked with a role at @entity27 during @entity25 ’s brief reign in charge but that never came off and his first stint in @entity74 ended with the sack in september			1
in the wake of his dismissal , @entity25 ( below ) maintained his methods would be suitable for the @entity80 game and stressed that his next job would be in the @entity74			2
the former @entity27 manager has held talks about taking on a director - style role at the club @entity52 , however , does not view a rebuilding job of @entity3 from top to bottom as an obvious attraction for his friend			1
@entity52 said : ‘ if @entity25 is up for trying to turn @entity3 around as a club on the football side , then they will have a great asset because he is a top man			1
‘ he is studious , intelligent and bright			0
he is also very single - minded , always with a very clear picture of what he wants from players and people around him			0
‘ he does not compromise much on that			0
he has a fairly established model of how he thinks it should be done and what he wants to do			0
‘ he has a great work ethic and requires that of his players			0
so @entity3 would certainly get their money ’s worth with him			2
‘ but if it ’s a director of football role or technical director , then i ca n’t imagine what he will do if there is no money to spend on players			1
‘ from what i know of him , he would be frustrated			0
i find it a bit mysterious			0
if he is finished as a manager , then that ’s a surprise to me			0
to give up now ? that ’s a bit of a mystery			0
’ @entity63 assistant @entity52 ( right ) played with @entity25 at @entity53 and finds the mystifying @entity25 was unveiled last week as having a one - per - cent stake in @entity3 , an investment of £ 200,000			1
his interest is understood to extend to wishing to overhaul @entity124 where the @entity3 development and scouting areas have been stripped to the bare bones over years of mismanagement and disregard by the hierarchy			2
@entity52 added : ‘ to be fair , @entity25 is a gambler , a punter			1
he does n’t mind speculating			0
so it could be there ’s a bit of that going on which he finds attractive			0
‘ i ’d have thought , though , someone of his @entity139 credentials would still have commanded a big - money post			0
‘ one of the things @entity25 requires is control , so i ca n’t imagine him going anywhere and staying long where he will have to kowtow to anyone			2
if he ’s given autonomy , then the move ( to @entity3 ) could work			1
’ @entity52 praised @entity25 's football knowledge and said he would be a fantastic asset to @entity3 @entity25 will be waiting in the wings to see if the @entity1 can seize control at @entity151			1
some hurdles were cleared during last week ’s talks but there remain others to be addressed with the main stumbling blocks being the make - up of any new @entity3 board			1
it is believed the @entity3 - friendly consortium are cautiously optimistic of striking a deal early in the week			2
both parties should be keen to reach a resolution without the costly and lengthy resort of an egm but that would be the most likely step if the proposal is not accepted by the current regime			0
@entity172 basketball owner @entity171 ’s camp have yet to learn of the @entity3 board ’s response , either , to his improved offer of £ 20m , including a short - term £ 6.5m loan			2
@entity171 was told his earlier £ 18m bid was thrown out because it undervalued the club			0
his push is unlikely to succeed as he requires 75 - per - cent support but the @entity12 / @entity13 / @entity14 alliance plus @entity183 control 33 per cent of votes .			0

@entity25 is keen to adopt a technical director - style role at @entity3
a former team - mate @entity52 says the move is mystifying
but said @entity25 would be a great asset to if the move materialises
