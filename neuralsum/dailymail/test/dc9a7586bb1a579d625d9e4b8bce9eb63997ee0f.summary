the world endurance championship , whose annual highlight is the @entity3 24 hours sportscar classic , is getting rid of the grid girls			1
in a move that will be applauded by many , and is sure to dismay those accustomed to seeing scantily - clad beauties posing next to cars before a race , the @entity7 - backed series is adopting a more progressive stance			1
' from @entity17 next week , you will see that for any race we will do - no grid girls like in the past , ' @entity15 chief executive @entity14 said after a presentation on thursday for the opening @entity17 six - hour race			1

the use of models , also referred to as ' race queens ' or ' umbrella girls ' , to stand by cars with flags or placards displaying drivers ' numbers has long been a feature of @entity47			2
it has also been a bone of contention for those seeking more equality and less sexism in a male - dominated sport , although in some series where women racers have joined the grid the ' umbrella ' role has been taken by a man			1

' it 's old school to have such a concept as grid girls			1
surely the world 's moved on ? and motor racing should follow quite closely what the rest of the world 's doing in that respect			2
' i think that 's a really nice touch , a modern touch as well , from the @entity15 to take that aspect of racing away			0
it is a bit sexist			0
' @entity14 said the cars would line up diagonally opposite the pit wall and grandstand as if for an old - style ' @entity3 start '			2
current world champion @entity63 has backed the decision to remove grid girls for equality in @entity3 of old , before safety concerns stopped the practice , drivers would run across the track to the cars but at @entity17 there will be a rolling start			1
@entity14 said the changes were all part of catering for a new audience			0
' the sport is sport , but around it we can do many things , ' he said			0
