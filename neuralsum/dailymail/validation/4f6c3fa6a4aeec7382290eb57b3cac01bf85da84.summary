a woman who uploaded a brutally honest ' @entity1 ' to the internet after discovering her parents had posted a profile of their daughter on a dating site has become a feminist hero			1
@entity8 , 23 , from @entity9 , could n't believe her eyes when she saw the account that her well - meaning parents had created in order to find her a husband			1
@entity8 , who works at the internet company @entity16 , decided to build her own description , with a no - holds - barred description of her likes , dislikes and general demeanor and posted it on a blogging site			1
@entity8 , 23 , from @entity9 , created a marriage cv online after her parents tried to find her a husband through a dating site speaking on her blog about the profile her parents created , @entity8 said : ' [ the ] details were , name : @entity8 , profession : software engineer			1
' i went like , " @entity34 is happening here , " because , i am no g * * * amn software engineer and i 'm only 23 ! ' i am [ not a ] woman desperate to get married , and that matrimony profile made me look like one			1
' @entity8 took the profile down and told her parents that she was going to build her own dating profile , telling them to , ' send this to anyone who has the nerve to ask my hand in marriage			1
' the so - called ' @entity47 ' is nothing like any dating profile you would find on a wannabe bride 's page and even states that she is interested in men who hate children			1
the profile reads : ' i wear glasses and look dorky in them			1
not a spendthrift or a shopaholic			2
' detest masala & drama , not a tv fan			2
@entity8 's marriage @entity47 ' not a womanly woman			1
wo n't grow long hair , ever			0
' @entity8 then went on to describe the sort of man she would be interested in hearing from			1
she said : ' looking for : a man , preferably bearded , who is passionate about seeing the world			0
' someone who earns for himself and does not hate his job			0
@entity74 points to the one who hates kids			0
' points for a great voice and an impressive personality			0
should be able to hold a conversation for at least 30 minutes			0
' she added : ' if you think you qualify , i recommend you re-think			0
if you are sure , i suggest you show this website to your parents			1
' if you 're still sure , try imagining a life with someone like me			0
' after just 48 hours , the cv went viral , with people from as far away as @entity91 and @entity92 picking it up			2
@entity8 says that the response to her piece has been overwhelming @entity8 is now being hailed as the face of modern @entity97 - a woman who 's not afraid to challenge traditional perceptions of femininity and womanhood			1
and her blog post has touched a nerve in the same week the @entity105 plan to air @entity97 's daughter , a documentary exploring the attitudes to women that formed the background for the brutal gang - rape and murder of a student on a @entity115 bus in 2012			1
filmmaker @entity116 , who made the programme which will show on @entity118 on sunday , march 8 , was disturbed that the men who perpetrated the crime barely seemed to realise they 'd done anything wrong			0
the bus driver @entity122 said : ' a decent girl wo n't roam around at nine o'clock at night			0
a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy			0
' while one of the laywers for the men , told @entity116 : ' we have the best culture			0
in our culture , there is no place for a woman			0
' yet despite this , @entity137 's gutsy marriage profile was met with widespread support			1
in a follow - up post she revealed the impact of her marriage cv			2
' for starters , people like genuine guts			0
they respect confident and free women , in the right way , ' she wrote			0
' many women could relate to the plight of their parents pestering them to get married			2
and men , without a choice , could only dream of marrying someone like the woman in the profile , me			2
' and it 's clear from comments on the site that @entity8 articulated the frustrations held by modern women in @entity97 trying to juggle their hopes and ambitions with the expectations of their traditional parents			1
one commenter writes : ' i am just 20 and is already being pressurized to start " looking " ( from orthodox muslim family here ) and i am holding out on my own			0
' but if i ever consider going the marriage route , i think i 'll just get inspired by you and create something like yours to sieve out the ones i 'd want to ever get married to and to scare off the kind i 'd rather avoid ! : @entity175 ' another says : ' i 'm too 24 , and seriously , all this " do - you - have - a - boyfriend / are - you - marriage - material etc etc etc " , the list goes till infinity , haunts me at nights ! ! ' why ca n't the society accepts us , the @entity185 , as the way we are ! ! '			2
