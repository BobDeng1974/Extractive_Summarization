now 300 wounded or emotionally - traumatised soldiers will have a little piece of @entity7 to call their own			1

in a first of its kind in the @entity7 , its population will almost entirely be made up of former troops who have suffered horrific physical or psychological injuries on the battlefield			1
a large number of servicemen and women will have been badly - wounded in the recent conflicts in @entity40 and @entity41			2
the project , dreamed up by the veteran 's retreat charity , would be built on a former tileworks close to the hamlet of @entity47 , @entity48 , and the village of @entity50 , @entity51			1
the trustees will seek planning permission in december and hope to open the first homes and care facility late next year			1
despite concerns from local residents that the new development will blight the countryside , the charity points out that it is on a brown - field site that housed a factory			1
the veterans ' village will also create up to 500 jobs in an area hit hard by unemployment and pump money into the local economy			2
the plans were launched by @entity73 @entity72 , the youngest soldier ever to be awarded the @entity74 - the highest military decoration for valour			2

yet he managed to drag several comrades to safety			0
he said : ' for guys to be able to sit down and talk about the old days and what they have been through is something that doctors can not offer			0
so we , as ex-servicemen and women , are going to cure ourselves			0
' we are regimented and we are one family and we will look after each other			0
on civvy street you do not have that - this is a good way of continuing friendships			0

ambitious scheme : @entity118 , who is leading the scheme , hopes it will be completed in five years the father - of - three , from @entity121 , @entity51 , who served with the @entity123 , said : ' people who are coming out of the service can find it difficult and may need counselling and medical treatment , such as physiotherapy , if they have been injured			0
' when you are with someone who has been through what you have been through , you can talk about your experiences and that makes them easier to deal with			0
' to have that sort of environment sitting there waiting for you when you come out , with a bungalow if you are in a wheelchair and with medical facilities on tap , is just a brilliant idea			0
' @entity145 hopes to raise initial funds of more than £ 100,000 to get the project up and running			1
