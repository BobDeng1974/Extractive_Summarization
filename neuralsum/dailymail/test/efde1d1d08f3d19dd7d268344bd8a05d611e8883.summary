a supporter waits the best part of an hour for five seconds with @entity2			1
there is a quick picture and good - luck message ahead of sunday 's @entity6			1
he is , evidently , one of the few players genuinely respected by @entity10 's disillusioned fans			1
@entity2 scored the winner at the @entity12 three seasons ago , affording him a terrace tribute – ' @entity2 , over the wall ' – as well as a place in black - and - white folklore			1
but there is more to the @entity10 's admiration than one free - kick against the enemy			1
a working - class @entity22 who came through the ranks at @entity24 and made 100 appearances by the time he was 21 before beating three career - threatening injuries , @entity2 ' gets ' the proud principles of the @entity28 – appreciation , hard graft , honesty and enjoyment			1
he has himself been a fan in the crowd during three of the last four derby defeats - he watched the other from a hotel room in @entity38 after undergoing surgery on the second of the cruciate ligament injuries which kept him out for 26 months			1
@entity10 utility player @entity2 ( right ) shields the ball from @entity44 forward @entity45 @entity2 scores with a superb free - kick against @entity47 to win the game 1 - 0 at the @entity12 @entity2 is congratulated by @entity10 defender @entity49 in the club 's last victory over @entity47 @entity10 supported him through that long rehabilitation , something for which @entity2 will always be grateful			1
but with his current contract at @entity56 set to expire this summer , the 30 - year - old does not know what the future holds			1
he would like to remain on @entity60			2
he accepts , though , that this could be his final taste of the fixture which has guaranteed him lifelong worship			1
' i have to be realistic , this could be my last derby , ' he told @entity66			1
' i do n't want it to be , but that will be in my mind			2
so i 'm not going to let it go the way of the last four - that can not carry on			2
' i 've left the stadium gutted after every one of them and i 've felt it like a fan			2
so we owe it to them now			2
' i grew up with @entity79 and @entity80 , but that is n't as big because you live in the same house a lot of the time			2
' so i 'll be doing everything i can personally do to make sure we 're up for it , because our performances in the last four just have n't been good enough			2
' @entity2 returned after more than two years of painstaking gym sessions alone for october 's 2 - 0 win at @entity91 in the @entity92			1
he was man - of - the - match and was greeted by a standing ovation in the dressing - room , where text messages from the likes of @entity97 and @entity98 awaited			2
ninety minutes against the champions , however , had taken its toll			0
in the next game , at home to @entity102 , @entity56 ' was stunned into silence when , after half an hour , a tearful @entity2 sat himself on the turf clutching the same ill - fated knee			1
@entity2 's injury record at @entity10 has severely limited his first - team appearances over the past few years the 30 - year - old is incredibly grateful to @entity10 for sticking by him and hopes to repay them on sunday ' i thought to myself , ' why me ? ' , ' he reflects			1
' you start doubting whether the knee will ever be strong enough			0
i was thinking , ' what have i skipped ? what have i done wrong ? '			0
' within an hour of the game i 'd had a scan and the cruciate was fine , relief is n't the word			0
i 'd probably got through the @entity91 game on pure adrenaline			0
so i think it was my body telling me just take your time			0
' i wo n't lie , the fact i 'm out of contract was on my mind and i wanted to be back sooner than the three months it took			2
' every game felt like another game off my career			0
but we did what was right and now there are no problems at all			0
' i 'll admit there were times when i thought i could n't do it and my old man just told me ' no '			0
' so when you 've had the tears and those dark days , you appreciate every minute			0
' on the subject of dark days , both @entity10 and @entity47 are horribly out of form going into what has been billed as ' the @entity146 '			1
the @entity47 could be in the relegation zone by the time kick - off arrives , while @entity10 have lost their last three under @entity149			1
to suffer another loss in the derby could prove unforgivable in the eyes of supporters whose last victory arrived courtesy of @entity2 's right boot in august , 2011			1
' the good thing is we 've got a cracking game now and if anything can rally us for the rest of the season then this is it , ' says @entity2 , who will start at right back			1
' to be on a winning team on the ground where it all started for me would make everything worthwhile , all of the hard work and long days during those two years			2
' but i remember that day so well			0
it was my first derby			2
i 've played in two now and i 'm yet to lose			0
' @entity170 ( @entity171 ) won a foul just on the corner of the box			0
my first @entity176 goal – for @entity177 against @entity10 – was from that exact position , so i fancied it			1
' i remember seeing @entity180 edging out , almost inviting me to put it in the top corner			0
that 's what i did			2
@entity49 tried to claim it , but he was nowhere near it			0
he tried to celebrate my goal by himself ! ' i knew my dad and brother were in the away end celebrating and i just thought , ' wow			0
they will be having some time in there '			0
@entity2 is one of the most popular players at @entity10 for his consistent and hard working performances ' @entity195 – one of my best mates – went through on goal in the last minute			1
looking back , i 'm probably relieved he did n't score to make it 2 - 0 ! ' i did n't realise at the time how big scoring the winner was and how much i would be remembered for just one goal			1
' it 'll be amazing if i 'm coming back here in 10 years ' time with my two boys and they 're still singing that song			0
' @entity2 adds : ' i 'll always be a @entity10 fan			1
this club has been brilliant with me			2
i could have been the forgotten man but they stuck by me			0
' now i need to show them that i can stay fit			0
i 've had some terrible luck , but i 'd like to think i 've got a lot left in me			0
' so this final part of the season is massive for me – i would love to stay here			0
' and with that the supporter has his photo			0
' what 's going to happen on sunday ? ' @entity2 is asked			1
over the wall , ' he laughs			0
you can see why they like him in these parts			0
@entity2 is out of contract at the end of the season and admits he does not know what the future has in store			1

@entity2 's injury record has severely limited the number of first - team appearances he has made for @entity10
still , the 30 - year - old utility player is one of the most popular at the club
@entity2 *etched* himself into @entity10 folklore in 2011 by scoring the winner with a superb free - kick against rivals @entity47
he is out of contract in the summer and sunday 's fixture at the @entity12 could be his last derby in a @entity10 shirt
