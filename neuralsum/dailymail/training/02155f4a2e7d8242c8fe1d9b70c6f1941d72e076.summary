cars during the 1950s were fitted with automatic dimming headlights called @entity188 , such as the 1959 @entity199 , pictured			2
it was designed to sense outside light and turn the exterior lights on and off depending on the lighting condition			0
however , it was temperamental and would switch on and off sporadically @entity23 later referred to its automatic dimming system as ' @entity212 '			2
the problem with the automatic dimming headlights was that they did n't not automatically turn off if the driver manually turned the headlights on to begin with , nor did it turn on the exterior lights for driving conditions such as heavy rain or fog			0
this meant oncoming drivers could be temporarily blinded by strong beams , and sometimes the lights did n't change in different weather conditions .			0
