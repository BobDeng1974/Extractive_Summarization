' it is very difficult to reconcile with people who have been killing your own soldiers , or your own countrymen , ' he said			0
' to the @entity27 , the message is very clear : stop killing , stop bombing , stop fighting , put down your weapons , join the political process and you can be part of the future of this country			0
staying put : @entity2 will tell the @entity53 today that no more than 500 troops will leave before autumn 2012 ' i have seen it in my own country , in @entity30 , where people who were involved in trying to kill , to maim and bomb civilians and police officers , army personnel and even politicians have actually become politicians themselves and are involved in the governance of that country			1
' it can happen and the message to the @entity27 is : you can not win this fight , you are losing this fight			0
' the government has been under pressure to follow the example of @entity75 president @entity74 , who announced last month that 10,000 troops deployed as part of the so - called ' surge ' strategy would be coming home by the end of this year , and another 23,000 next			1

' if what we are doing was not working by then then i think you would have some serious questions to ask me			0
' he went on : ' this is a matter of judgement			0
it is my judgement that it is right for the @entity5 public to know , for the @entity6 public to know , for the @entity6 and the @entity5 military to know , that there is an endpoint to this			1
' an endpoint after which we will still be training , we will still be helping , but we wo n't be in a combat role			0
