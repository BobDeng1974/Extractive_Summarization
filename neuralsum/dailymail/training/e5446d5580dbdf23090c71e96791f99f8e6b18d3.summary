by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 17:03 est , 8 december 2012 each day begins the same as the last for professor @entity2			1
his alarm rings at 7.30am , he showers , eats cornflakes and , when he is meeting lawyers , dresses in a jaunty orange @entity11 tie and navy pinstripe suit that hangs off him after losing 20lb on his prison diet			2
after a day emailing friends and writing physics papers from a small bedroom , he moves on to the roof terrace where he does 40 push - ups and 40 box squats , before bedtime at 11.30pm			1
this is exactly how tomorrow will pan out – and indeed , the next 850 - plus days			2
because after 32 years as a celebrated physicist at an @entity25 university , 69 - year - old @entity21 , from @entity22 , is under house arrest at a friend ’s @entity28 apartment after being found guilty of drug smuggling			1
@entity2 said being incarcerated was dehumanising : ' it was like being an animal in a cage '			1
after 280 days in prison with chain - smoking cellmates , he was permitted to live out his sentence under house arrest the apartment is a far cry from the cell he shared with 79 hardened criminals , but it is still his prison			2
yet prof @entity2 ’s only crimes , he says , are loneliness and naivety			1
thirteen months ago , he was seduced on an internet dating website by someone he believed was a beautiful @entity52 model			2
they planned to meet in @entity54 but when @entity2 arrived , he was greeted by a man claiming to be the model ’s friend			1
this friend said she had left for a modelling assignment in @entity60 and that @entity2 should follow her there , via @entity28 – taking with him a suitcase that belonged to her			1
in reality , the model was a happily married woman who knew nothing of the professor ’s existence – and the online ‘ lover ’ was a drug trafficking gang who had filled the lining of the suitcase with bundles of cocaine concealed in gift wrap			1
though @entity2 pleaded innocent during a three - day hearing last month , it took three judges just one hour to find him guilty and sentence him to four years and eight months , of which he will serve two years four months			1
@entity81 , a 36 - year - old married woman born in the @entity52 who now lives in @entity82			2
until contacted by @entity83 after his arrest , she claims to have had no knowledge of @entity21 after 280 days in custody in a prison with chain - smoking cellmates , he was permitted , because of a chronic lung condition , to live out the sentence under house arrest at the @entity28 apartment of an old friend from their days as @entity96 students			1
defence lawyers are currently working on an appeal , which will be submitted this week			0
speaking exclusively to @entity83 , prof @entity2 said : ‘ i am still in a state of shock			1
i ca n’t believe i am a convicted felon			0
i am an innocent man			0
i am a scam victim			0
my only crime was being lonely			0
‘ i am so angry with myself , with what has happened			0
‘ prison was very dehumanising			0
it was like being an animal in a cage			0
now , i ’m confined to the flat and my friend ’s family have adopted me			0
they are my support group			0
‘ but even after 40 weeks , it has an air of surreality , to wake up and realise where you are and that you ca n’t just go out and walk around			0
’ his ordeal began in november 2011 when he struck up a friendship on a dating website with someone he believed was model @entity81 , a former @entity120 from the @entity52			0
after corresponding for 11 weeks , he was smitten and agreed to meet her in @entity54 where she said she was on a modelling assignment			0
though @entity81 does exist , she is a 36 - year - old married woman born in the @entity52 who now lives in @entity82			2
until contacted by @entity83 after his arrest , she claims to have had no knowledge of @entity21			0
yet at the time @entity2 was convinced the relationship was genuine			1
in january , he travelled from his @entity128 home to @entity129 in @entity54 , where he was met by a man claiming to be @entity81 ’s friend			0
@entity2 claims that this friend told him @entity81 had left for another modelling job in @entity60 and was waiting for him there			1
this friend also handed him the suitcase			0
professor @entity2 , pictured with his ex-wife @entity138			1
two days after his arrest , he was sent to @entity139 , a @entity28 jail famed for riots in 1978 that left 62 dead desperate to meet his new ‘ girlfriend ’ , @entity2 set out on a journey from @entity54 to @entity60 , via @entity144 in @entity28 , where he was told he would be sent an e-ticket by @entity81			1
yet when it failed to appear after 44 hours , he tried to board a plane home to @entity128 – and was arrested when security officials discovered four pounds of cocaine in a false bottom in the suitcase he had checked in			2
‘ i would like to warn people of the evils of internet dating , ’ says @entity2 , who did not speak to his ‘ lover ’ beforehand			1
‘ i would advise internet daters to have a telephone conversation with the other person , preferably with a video link			0
there are so many criminals out there			0
i never expected to be a scam victim			0
’ two days after his arrest , he was sent to @entity139 , a @entity28 jail famed for riots in 1978 that left 62 dead			1
‘ @entity165 kept me going , ’ says prof @entity2			1
‘ every day i went to the small university centre in the prison and worked on physics , which helped me maintain my sanity			2
’ prof @entity2 's case is complicated by 27 messages he sent to a phone he believed to belong to @entity173 , pictured , implying he was carrying drugs and despite now being placed on unpaid leave by @entity176 , he adds : ‘ i have ideas for eight research projects , distributed between particle phenomenology and theoretical cosmology			1
and i am going to learn @entity181			0
’ beneath the stiff upper lip is a man in turmoil			0
although he is now able to concentrate on his research , he admits he has barely slept since his conviction			1
even if his appeal succeeds , it could take months for his sentence to be revoked			0
in their ruling , the judges said they believed the unanswered messages were signs of mutual understanding between @entity2 and @entity81 his case is complicated by a series of text messages he sent to a phone he believed to belong to @entity81 , while at @entity144			1
bored and tired , he sent 27 messages implying he was carrying drugs			1
‘ i wanted to string her along and sent a series of text messages , some of which referred to “ sniffer dogs ” and “ coca ” , and said , “ this stuff is worth millions			1
” ‘ these messages were purely to amuse her , ’ he says			2
‘ i had the bright idea , which i now bitterly regret , of mentioning drugs			0
frustrated because i had not met her , i chose to amuse her with an ill - choice of joking text messages			1
‘ i had no idea there were drugs in the bag – i thought it was hers			0
’ he added : ‘ real drug mules would never talk about drugs via text message or email			0
’ but in their ruling , the judges said they believed the unanswered messages were signs of mutual understanding between @entity2 and @entity81			1
@entity2 ’s defence team argue that @entity232 showing long periods when he left the suitcase unattended proves his innocence			2
psychological reports conclude that @entity2 suffers from some traits of @entity239 ’s syndrome as well as @entity240 , which impede him from distinguishing reality from fantasy			1
told @entity83 : ‘ @entity2 is a very special man and there is not enough information to condemn him			2
it is hard to believe his story , but the judges need to see things through his eyes			0
‘ they need to look at the big picture and not just focus on the drugs in a suitcase and text messages			2
’ prof @entity2 added : ‘ my life has been in the brilliant world of theoretical physics , not the sordid world of @entity25 drugs traffickers			1
i simply was n’t equipped mentally to be suspicious of people			0
‘ i live in a world of the physics of the universe where colleagues are truthful			2
and as incredible and incredulous as it might sound , this is the truth			0

physics professor from @entity22 says he has barely slept since conviction in @entity28
admits sending series of messages implying he was a cocaine smuggler , but says they were an ' ill - choice of joke '
psychological reports say @entity2 , 69 , suffers from @entity239 's and @entity240
