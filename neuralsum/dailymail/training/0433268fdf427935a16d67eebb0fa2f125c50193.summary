by @entity0 published : 05:16 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 12:07 est , 13 november 2012 the boss of @entity4 's @entity3 division has left the company just two weeks after launching the flagship @entity7 software and surface tablet described as ' make or break ' for the company			1
23 - year veteran @entity10 , head of @entity4 's @entity3 unit , was widely tipped to be the next chief executive of @entity4 his ' shocking ' departure is seen by many as an attempt by ceo @entity16 to increase his control of the company as it faces increased competition from @entity19 and @entity20			1
today it was announced he is leaving the firm			0
the surface is @entity4 's first foray into computer hardware			2
however , it has hit problems with ' modest ' sales and users complaining or problems with the gadget 's snap on keyboard			1
based on a @entity38 chip designed by @entity39 , the @entity26 will run a simplified version of @entity7 that is not compatible with old @entity4 applications			0
however , the tablet will feature new app - style versions of @entity47 mainstays such as @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , and will include @entity52 games , video and music apps			2
the @entity26 , with two cameras and a usb port , will be @entity57 only the move was unexpected and neither @entity4 nor @entity10 gave an explanation , although an executive at the company , who asked not to be named , said the decision was ' mutual ' and said he was not expecting @entity10 to take a job at another company soon			1
' this is shocking news			0
' this is very surprising , ' said @entity67 , an analyst at @entity68			0
' like a lot of people , i thought @entity10 was in line to potentially be @entity16 's successor			1
' @entity10 , 47 , joined @entity4 in 1989 and made his mark as @entity76 ' technical assistant			1
he grew into an uncompromising leader whose ruthless style of cutting layers of management and formalizing the process of software development gave rise to the term " @entity85 " in the company			1
he wielded immense power as head of the @entity3 unit , the traditional center of @entity4 's business , but was not known for working well with other executives			1
one former @entity4 employee who worked with @entity10 and other executives said his relentlessly aggressive style exasperated other leaders and may have alienated too many people , including his mentor @entity76			1
' he had no one left to fight for him , ' said the staffer , who asked not to be named			0
' @entity76 gave him cover , so he must have eventually caved			0
' it leaves @entity16 , 56 , shows no sign of leaving after almost 13 years in the job , despite almost constant criticism			0
@entity10 was also one of the team behind @entity4 's surface tablet , which has only had ' modest ' sales the firm has said he has now replaced all the leaders of @entity4 's five main operating units in the past four years			1
he told employees in a memo on monday simply that : ' @entity10 has decided to leave the company			1
' in a later media statement , he added that it was ' imperative that we continue to drive alignment across all @entity4 teams , and have more integrated and rapid development cycles for our offerings '			0
' @entity3 has to be much more thoroughly integrated with @entity52 , with other parts of the company , ' said @entity67			1
' i do n't know that was something @entity128 was as excited about as focusing on @entity3			2
' @entity10 had a stellar career at @entity4 , overhauling the hugely profitable office division before going over to manage the release of @entity132 in 2009			1
that was regarded as a success and @entity10 was then tasked with overseeing @entity3 8 , @entity4 's new - look , touch - friendly operating system designed to bridge the gap with mobile computing leaders @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity138 may have a stereotype as the land of computer nerds and alpha males , but the modern technology boss is increasingly likely to be a woman			2
in : @entity145 will replace @entity10 as @entity4 ceo now the likes of @entity149 's @entity148 and @entity150 , ceo of @entity152 have been joined by @entity145 , the new president of @entity3 who is just the latest female tech maven to step in to a high - profile role			1
@entity4 said on monday that it has promoted company veteran ms @entity145 to lead all its @entity3 software and hardware engineering			1
tech @entity157 : in 2008 , @entity148 became coo at @entity149 and is now the first woman on the company 's board of directors			0
@entity162 will take over responsibility for the @entity3 business , while retaining her posts as chief financial officer and chief marketing officer			2
since 1993 , ms @entity145 has worked on and led some of the most successful products for @entity4 , including the user experiences for early versions of @entity172 , and helped drive the thinking behind the refresh of the user experience for @entity176			0
for @entity132 and @entity7 she was responsible for program management , user interface design and research , as well as development of all international releases			0
she has a master 's degree in software engineering from @entity185 and a bachelor 's degree in business administration from @entity188 , according to @entity189			2
in her new role she will be responsible for all future @entity3 product development in addition to future hardware opportunities			2
ms @entity145 is the latest woman to ascend the largely male - dominated tech industry			0
@entity150 was appointed ceo of @entity152 in july			0
in 2008 , @entity148 became coo at @entity149 and is now the first woman on the company 's board of directors			0
all smiles : @entity150 's @entity199 was appointed ceo of @entity152 in july at the same time , @entity10 led the development of @entity4 's surface tablet , its first own - brand computer , aimed at tackling @entity19 's wildly successful @entity204 head on			1
analysts said it may be too early to judge whether @entity7 and the @entity26 have been a success , after launching on oct. 26 , but @entity10 's departure could have been tied to his abrasive management and ambition for the top job			2
from @entity7 to @entity210 to @entity211 , @entity10 has worked across all aspects of he joined the @entity3 team after the vista operating system debuted and headed up the development of @entity132 and then @entity7			1
' we started to look back and we said , ‘ wow , the user interface , the experience , the form factors , the kinds of pcs were all developed in the mid 1990s , '' @entity10 said last month in an interview with @entity217			2
' we looked and we said , ‘ things are so different			0
we need to envision a new kind of software for those scenarios , because the world is a different place			0
’ ' ' it sounded like it had more to do with his leadership style , ' said @entity67 at @entity68			0
' there was n't really a next move for @entity128 at this point			0
' @entity10 said : ' it is impossible to count the blessings i have received over my years at @entity4 , ' he said in a statement			2
" i am humbled by the professionalism and generosity of everyone i have had the good fortune to work with at this awesome company			0
' @entity10 will be succeeded by @entity145 , who will head the @entity3 hardware and software division , and @entity162 , who will remain chief financial officer of the @entity3 unit			1
together , they will report directly to @entity16			0
@entity10 's departure comes two weeks after rival @entity19 shook up its own top management , forcing out mobile head @entity253 and retail chief @entity255			1
one analyst cited talk that the moves might be related			0
' some are speculating that the availability on the market of @entity253 might have something to do with @entity10 's departure , ' said @entity264 analyst @entity263			1
' i doubt we will have to wait long to know if this is the case			0
