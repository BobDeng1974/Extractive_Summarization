by @entity0 published : 18:52 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 18:56 est , 4 october 2013 calls : @entity3 mps have demanded @entity6 fire @entity4 amidst claims he tried to block a report into hospital neglect former health secretary @entity4 is facing calls to quit after claims he tried to block the publication of a devastating report into hospital neglect before the last election			1
@entity3 mps demanded @entity6 fire mr @entity4 as shadow health secretary after the @entity18 published damning emails which show the health watchdog was asked to stop the release of a report on @entity24 and @entity25 hospital in @entity26 where patients were left to die			1
@entity29 ’s most powerful civil servant cabinet secretary sir @entity28 was last night examining whether he needs to set up a @entity31 investigation into whether civil servants breached their code of conduct			0
emails released under the @entity36 have revealed that the @entity37 stopped the watchdog @entity38 from releasing the report just hours before it was due to be published in november 2009			1
the report revealed that death rates in @entity42 were a third above average while catheters were strewn on the floor and blood was spattered on the walls and curtains			1
mr @entity4 was ‘ furious ’ when news of the poor standards of care was leaked , the emails reveal			1
in a second controversy , the commission was due to publish its ‘ state of care report ’ into hospitals and care homes in february 2010 , three months before the election			2
yet an email sent round by a senior @entity38 boss following a meeting with one of mr @entity4 ’s junior ministers instructs them that , ‘ given the political environment ’ , the report should be ‘ largely positive ’			1
in july , in a @entity67 debate on hospital scandals , mr @entity4 rounded on health secretary @entity69 after he was accused of covering up poor care			1
mr @entity4 said at the time : ‘ the secretary of state claims that we were covering up ... it is outrageous for [ him ] to come to the @entity67 and repeat those concerns without a shred of evidence to back them up ’			1
mr @entity4 is now accused of misleading mps about his role in the affair and is facing calls to make a statement to @entity84 next week			1
@entity3 mp @entity85 , who obtained the emails , said : ‘ @entity87 tried to cover up failing hospitals before the last general election			2
@entity4 told the @entity67 in july there was no shred of evidence of political interference with the health regulator			1
‘ but these emails show a clear paper trail of political meddling – leading back to him			1
‘ he owes a big apology to the patients and families who suffered , and he should resign			2
no one will ever trust @entity87 with our hospitals again			0
’ he added that he had written to @entity6 demanding mr @entity4 be sacked			2
denial : shadow health secretary @entity4 denied a cover up as recently as three months ago ' [ health secretary @entity69 ] claims that we were covering up ... it is outrageous for him to come to the @entity67 and repeat those concerns without a shred of evidence to back them up			1
' as recently as july 16 , @entity4 insisted the @entity38 had not been pressured by @entity87			2
appearing in the @entity112 he said : ‘ the secretary of state claims that we were covering up , so let me answer on the question of ministers ’ integrity ... let me quote to him from a letter sent by [ ex @entity38 chairman ] @entity120 to the prime minister yesterday : “ @entity38 was not pressurised by the previous government to tone down its regulatory judgments or to hide quality failures ”			0
’ however , as the @entity18 reported yesterday , emails show he was ‘ furious ’ when a report on poor care at @entity24 and @entity25 was issued to the media			1
they also showed his junior minister , @entity130 , warning the @entity38 close to the election that ‘ at this sort of time everything you do is going to be political ’			0
another message from february 2010 , when the @entity38 was due to publish its ‘ state of care report ’ , said it should be ‘ largely positive ’			2
@entity140 , the @entity38 ’s director of clinical quality , wrote : ‘ it is really important that we get the tone absolutely right			0
’ @entity120 has indicated she was forced out of the @entity38 by political pressure by the last @entity87 government			0
@entity146 , the former @entity38 head of media said : ‘ the message that “ we do n’t want bad news ” infected the whole organisation			0
’ former @entity38 head of media , @entity146 , has previously said the watchdog was told by @entity87 before the general election that ‘ we do n’t want bad news ’			0
@entity120 , the former chairman of the @entity38 , told the @entity160 inquiry into deaths at @entity162 , under oath , that the @entity38 was ‘ under more pressure ... when @entity4 became minister ’			2
professor sir @entity166 , the country ’s foremost expert on hospital death rates , has said @entity87 ran an @entity170 ‘ denial machine ’ , which ignored issues in the @entity170 when they were politically inconvenient			1
after the publication of the emails yesterday , @entity3 mp @entity172 wrote to sir @entity28 asking him to investigate whether the civil service code was breached			0
he wrote : ‘ the evidence presented this morning suggests that @entity4 , then health secretary , and his team , attempted to manipulate the release of @entity38 reports for political gain			1
‘ i am deeply concerned civil servants came under undue political pressure from the front bench labour team and those associated with them , who were nervous about the proximity of the general election			0
’ tweet : health secretary @entity69 said he was ' shocked ' by the revelation health secretary mr @entity69 tweeted : ‘ shocking revelations on @entity4 ’s attempts to cover up failing hospitals			1
’ he added : ‘ what it looks like … is that the last government wanted the @entity170 to be a good news factory , really , in the run - up to the last election – to the extent that they were prepared to lean on the regulator not to publish a report about poor care at one hospital , and i think that ’s wrong			2
‘ that ’s why i announced this week that we will make the @entity38 , the regulator , completely independent in the way the @entity210 is			0
’ mr @entity4 demanded an apology from the @entity212 and threatened to sue mr @entity69			2
he claimed he was only ‘ furious about the release of the information on the hospital because the leak of the report into @entity24 hospital broke @entity37 rules ’			1
in a letter to mr @entity69 he said : ‘ the unauthorised briefing by a @entity38 press officer , which broke the @entity224 rules , was not agreed with the senior leadership of the @entity38			0
‘ i ordered a press release , in accordance with proper process , be issued later that day			0
it is impossible to see how you can claim this amounted to a cover - up			0
’ he asked for evidence ‘ to substantiate your assertion			0
if you fail to provide such evidence , i will require a full retraction and public apology			0
if that is not forthcoming i will consider further action ’			0
@entity87 said it had asked mr @entity69 to ‘ substantiate his comments or withdraw them ’ .			0
