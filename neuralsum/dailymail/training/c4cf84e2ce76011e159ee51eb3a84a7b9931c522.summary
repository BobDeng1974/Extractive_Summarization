adding to signs of distress in the nuclear force , the @entity0 fired two commanders and disciplined a third yesterday			2
the action was a response to internal investigations of leadership lapses and misbehavior at two of its three intercontinental ballistic missile bases			0
the most senior officer to be relieved was col. @entity14 , the no. 2 commander of the @entity15 at @entity16 , @entity17 , in charge of 150 of the @entity0 's @entity20 3 nuclear icbms			1
the actions on monday were confirmed to @entity33 in response to an @entity33 inquiry about an internal @entity0 investigation of two commanders at the @entity37 at @entity38 , @entity39 , which also is responsible for 150 @entity20 3 missiles			0
a separate investigation was conducted at @entity42			0
the @entity0 nuclear missile corps has suffered a rash of recent setbacks , including the firing last year of its top commander and a number of security lapses			2
it is unusual for disciplinary action to be taken against senior officers at two of the @entity0 's three nuclear missile bases on the same day			2
officials said the timing was a coincidence			0
it extends a pattern of leadership failures in the @entity63 force over the past year			0
last march nine officers were fired at @entity65 , @entity66 , which is the third of the three nuclear missile bases , in response to an exam - cheating scandal there			1
on the same day as that announcement , the @entity15 at @entity42 disclosed that it had fired col. @entity73 , the officer in charge of the three missile squadrons there			1
it has never fully explained that action			0
last year , maj. gen. @entity78 , commander of the entire @entity63 force , was fired after an investigation into a drinking binge and other misconduct while he was in @entity83 as head of a visiting @entity86 government delegation			1
the nuclear missile force , whose work is arguably the most sensitive in the military , has been beset with problems in discipline , training , leadership and morale , prompting defense secretary @entity96 in february to order an independent review			0
the results of that review are expected to be announced in coming weeks			0
in response to an @entity33 inquiry monday , lt. col. @entity100 , spokesman for @entity101 , which is in charge of the @entity104 3 force as well as its nuclear bomber fleet , said that as a result of the @entity38 investigation a missile squadron commander , lt. col. @entity111 , was relieved of command monday ' because of a loss of confidence in @entity111 's ability to lead his squadron			1
' an @entity63 launch site located among fields and farms in the countryside outside @entity38 , @entity39 is pictured sheets said the investigation was directed by maj. gen. @entity123 , commander of the 20th @entity0 , and ' substantiated that @entity111 engaged in unlawful discrimination or harassment			1
' he added that the probe found that @entity111 ' made statements to subordinates that created a perception within his squadron that pregnancy would negatively affect a woman 's career			2
' the probe also substantiated allegations that @entity111 had failed to ensure the well - being of his troops			1
in march a two - person crew operating a @entity140 launch control center at @entity38 felt ill from fumes created by a refurbishment project , but the crew remained at their post because they believed @entity111 would have taken action against them had they left			1
they later were hospitalized , @entity100 said			0
there are three missile squadrons at each of the three nuclear missile wings			0
each squadron is responsible for 50 missiles operated by officers in five underground launch control centers			0
the second officer targeted in the @entity38 investigation was col. @entity23 , commander of the @entity161 , which is in charge of the three missile squadrons at @entity38 , including @entity111 's			1
sheets said the investigation confirmed that @entity23 ' failed to promote and safeguard the morale , well - being and welfare of the airmen under his command			1
' @entity23 received administrative punishment in the form of a letter in his personnel file , but @entity100 said he could not be more specific about the punishment			1
the complaints against @entity14 , the vice commander of the @entity15 at @entity42 , were the most extensive , according to @entity100 ' description of the case			1
sheets said @entity14 ' immediate superior , col. @entity179 , commander of the 90th , removed him following an internal investigation that substantiated allegations of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman , and cruelty and maltreatment of a subordinate			1
' in four separate instances , @entity14 acted in a manner that degraded his status as a senior officer and wing leader including maltreating a subordinate , ' @entity100 said			2
the most recent incident involving @entity14 was in september and occurred at a thrift store operated on @entity42 by volunteers , @entity100 said			2
according to the investigation report as described by @entity178 , @entity14 went to the shop , called @entity201 , to discuss shopping hour policies			2
' he hit the sign on the airman 's @entity201 door and repeatedly hit the shop 's front counter while raising his voice , using profanity ' and threatening to shut down the place , @entity100 said			0
it was this incident which prompted a complaint to the @entity15 's inspector general , leading to the investigation and the decision by @entity179 to remove @entity14			1
three other incidents of allegedly inappropriate behavior on base by @entity14 during 2014 were substantiated in the investigation , including one in may in which his behavior was described by one officer and a witness as shocking			2
@entity100 said the disciplinary actions at @entity38 and @entity42 reflect an effort to ensure that commanders do not behave in ways that detract from the mission			0
' our people must treat each other with dignity and respect , ' @entity100 said			0
' that applies up and down the chain of command			0

col. @entity14 , the no. 2 commander of the @entity15 at @entity16 , @entity17 , has been relieved
lt. col. @entity111 was relieved of command and col. @entity23 received administrative punishment
it follows 9 officers being fired at @entity65 , @entity66 , in march after an exam - cheating scandal
