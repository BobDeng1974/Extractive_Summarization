for eight weeks , the sight of a shirtless @entity3 swinging scythes and standing up to the nefarious @entity1 has been getting the nation hot under the collar			1
now , less than 12 hours after @entity7 ended with a dramatic cliffhanger , disgruntled viewers have taken to @entity9 to complain of ' withdrawal symptoms ' - and urge the @entity11 to hurry up with series two			1
' as if the @entity15 hiatus was n't bad enough ... experiencing # @entity7 withdrawal symptoms already , ' tweeted fan @entity16 within minutes of the closing credits			1
others complained of having their monday morning blues made worse by waking up to the prospect of going months before seeing mr @entity3 , 31 , and his famous abs on screen once more			2
' the morning after # @entity7 ends and amazingly , the sun has managed to rise in the sky , ' wrote @entity38			2
' have a good week everyone , or as good as it can be			0
' another , @entity42 , added : ' waking up to a week with no # @entity7 to look forward to			2
@entity44 , life is tough			0
' bereft : @entity7 fans such as @entity47 took to @entity9 to complain about the show ending missing out : fans say they have nothing to look forward to now the show is over not quite true : @entity7 will be replaced in the schedules with @entity54 drama , @entity53 painful : others said they were experiencing withdrawal symptoms less than 12 hours after the finale the drama has proved one of the most successful of 2015 so far , pulling in an average of 5.9 million viewers per episode and a massive 6.1 million for last night 's finale			1
much of that is due to mr @entity3 and his smouldering looks which , combined with regular shirtless scenes , have produced a collective swoon among female viewers			2
but it has n't all been plain sailing for the drama , which has been renewed and will start filming again this autumn			1
@entity7 's famous scything scenes have sparked complaints from professional mowers who say @entity3 's scything techniques are n't up to scratch			1
' the story of @entity7 highlights the romantic aspect of the scythe and its use in history but we were n’t very impressed with @entity3 ’s scything , ' said expert mower @entity84 , 56 , last week			1
next year : with filming on season two of @entity7 due to start filming this autumn , fans are in for a long wait popular : @entity3 and his famous abs have been the highlight of the show for many women ' there was a lot of sweating and grunting going on but the only time you ’d mow like that would be in a competition			1
' at the end of march , an # @entity102 wheeze launched by the @entity11 's social media team also descended into farce after viewers bombarded mr @entity3 with indecent proposals			1
' how do you ever stop looking in the mirror ? ' asked one fan			0
another added : ' my mower has packed in - would you come round and scythe my lawn please ? ' although the 31 - year - old made a stab at answering many of the questions , he left the more risqué queries go unanswered			2
while the second series of @entity7 is n't due to air until 2016 , mr @entity3 's legion of fans can take some consolation from @entity126 , an upcoming thriller in which the @entity128 actor stars			1
scheduled for release later this year , it co-stars @entity133 - born actor @entity132 , 46 , @entity135 star @entity134 , 30 , and veteran actress @entity136 , 78			0
got withdrawal symptoms ? meet the hunks set to light up the big and small screens this summer @entity7 might be no more , for this year at least , but there 's no shortage of cinematic and small screen crumpet , much of it shirtless , around this summer			1
along with mr @entity3 's upcoming role in @entity126 , @entity146 's handsome 29 - year - old son @entity145 will please the ladies during his shirt - free scenes in new film , @entity149			1
like father , like son ! @entity146 's son @entity145 will be shirtless in cinemas from this june @entity154 : @entity155 and the strippers will be back in july with @entity157 the film , which gets its @entity160 release in june , co-stars @entity161 and tells the story of a former champion bull rider and his quest for love			0
less romantic but with a whole lot of pecs appeal is the second instalment of @entity154 ; the @entity155 film about the exploits of a troupe of male strippers			0
entitled @entity157 , it opens on the 4th july and along with 35 - year - old @entity155 , also features the @entity175 @entity174 , 38			0
