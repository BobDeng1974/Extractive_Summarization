back at his swish penthouse apartment in @entity2 , @entity0 would have rocked back on his settee and let out an enormous belly laugh			0
he is the biggest winner here			0
this is the @entity7 team @entity6 ’s manager wants to face on december 28 , the one who can not defend a set - piece for love nor money			1
what a charitable bunch @entity14 ’s men can be			2
it was a seasonal slip - up , conceding a 97th - minute equaliser when poor @entity18 was bamboozled out of the way by @entity20			1
@entity0 will love that , confirmation that this @entity7 team , for all their good form of late , are capable of conceding at any stage of the game			2
in the post-match analysis @entity14 admitted that there were ‘ tactical and psychological reasons ’ behind this awkward performance at @entity28			1
tactically , truth be told , they were pretty much played off the park by a @entity38 side who have yet to decide whether they are in transition or whether they can still finish in the top four			1
the psychological reasons that @entity14 alluded to were the visions — make that nightmares — of the 5 - 1 defeat @entity38 inflicted here last season			1
@entity61 shoots through a crowd of bodies in the area to give @entity38 a 1 - 0 lead against @entity7 @entity7 defender @entity66 attempts to block the ball as @entity61 rifles in his first half goal it seems incredible to think that a team @entity72 believes are one of the best in @entity75 can be so vulnerable mentally			1
there is enough experience in this team , enough medals between them to do a bit better than this			0
when they concede like this you wonder what are they being taught at training			0
those five @entity6 strikers @entity0 has been talking about probably ca n’t wait to get among this @entity7 defence at @entity25 in a few days ’ time			1
that game is shaping up to be a shootout for the @entity93 , an invigorating clash between @entity0 ’s upstarts and this vulnerable @entity7 defence			2
the stats that @entity6 ’s manager love so much would have been in one hand and a large glass of 1986 @entity101 in the other			2
@entity0 will drink to this			0
@entity104 is congratulated by @entity6 player @entity105 after his first half strike against @entity107 @entity7 had only 35 per cent possession here , shut down every time the playmakers — @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 — got on the ball			1
at one stage during a first half that was dominated in its entirety by @entity38 , there was a 10 - minute period when @entity72 ’ team enjoyed 87 per cent of the play			1
that is impressive for @entity38 , enough for @entity72 to describe their performance as better than last year ’s 5 - 1			1
at one stage he even called it ‘ brilliant ’			0
still , that is no excuse for a team who were leading 2 - 1 when referee @entity127 signalled that there would be nine minutes of added time because of the earlier injury sustained to @entity20 ’s head			1
@entity132 is struggling , returning from suspension to take his place at right back in defence			0
@entity7 playmakers such as @entity112 ( left ) and @entity111 found space at a premium at @entity28 ‘ we are guilty because we did n’t jump at all with @entity20 , ’ admitted @entity14 , but there was more to it than just a simple challenge inside the penalty area from a corner			1
you always fancy your chances against this back four and the kid is offered zero protection by @entity110 , the man immediately in front of him			0
these are two youngsters and yet they need to develop an instinctive relationship , a protective cloak if they are to form a partnership down the right in the years to come			0
@entity18 ( right ) is struggling but he is getting little protection from @entity110 without it they will be targeted , as they were here by the lung - busting first - half runs of @entity163			2
on the ball , @entity38 were sharp and inventive again			2
‘ there were memories from last season and maybe it played a part , ’ admitted @entity14			0
‘ we let them come at us and when you do n’t score a third you can never relax			0
’ instead , they left @entity0 and his @entity6 team sitting pretty .			0

@entity7 drew 2 - 2 with @entity177 at @entity28 on *sunday*
the @entity24 were leading 2 - 1 deep into injury time
@entity38 's @entity20 beat @entity18 to a header to equalise
