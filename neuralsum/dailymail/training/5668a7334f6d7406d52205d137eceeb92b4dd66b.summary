the @entity0 has again questioned the financial ' failings ' of @entity3 following the downfall over the past week of @entity5 and @entity6			1
earlier this season @entity0 president @entity7 's plan to introduce a budget cap for 2015 was torpedoed by the major marques			1
despite an indication the teams were willing to finally accept a cost cap - after a 2009 proposal under former @entity0 president @entity15 was also rejected - it was ultimately thrown out to @entity7 's fury			1
the @entity19 team have followed @entity6 into administration this season a security officer takes down the @entity23 flag as the @entity6 factory in @entity25 is closed now , in the words of @entity15 earlier this week ' the chickens have come to roost ' , with the financial unsustainability of running a @entity3 team leading to @entity6 and @entity5 entering administration			1
offering a clear indication the situation has to change , the @entity0 has vowed to pursue a situation where the gap between the haves and have nots closes			0
a statement from the @entity0 read : ' looking beyond the end of the 2014 season , these failings again acutely raise the question of the economic balance of the @entity0 @entity3 and justify the position , expressed many times by the @entity0 , in favour of any initiative that will help reduce costs in order to ensure the survival of the existing grid or attract potential new entrants			2
@entity0 president @entity53 , speaking with @entity19 supremo @entity52 , saw his calls for a budget cap rejected ' as such , the @entity0 , in close co-operation with @entity57 ( @entity52 's @entity57 ) and the different stakeholders in @entity3 , will continue to work towards maintaining the attraction of the championship and the equitable participation of the teams in it in the years to come			1
' many will view the @entity0 's response as simply hot air as it has so far failed to turn meaningful actions in the past into reality			0
for now , it would appear the @entity0 is to treat @entity5 and @entity6 with leniency in light of their circumstances			2
former @entity0 president @entity15 has warned that @entity5 ‘ may not be the last ’ to struggle the sport 's regulations dictate a team that fails to fulfil its contractual obligations to the championship would face penalties			1
for now , @entity52 has given the two teams dispensation to miss this weekend 's race in the @entity82 and the next in @entity83 just over a week away			0
as for the season - ending grand prix in @entity86 , that remains to be seen as administrators are currently trying to find buyers for both organisations			0
both @entity6 and @entity5 have been given special dispensation not to race at the @entity82 @entity91 the statement added : ' the @entity0 has been informed of the financial difficulties of the @entity94 and @entity95 and of the considerable uncertainty surrounding their participation in the final races of the 2014 championship			2
' it is the responsibility of the @entity0 stewards to determine whether or not a team has failed to fulfil its regulatory obligation to take part in all events on the calendar and to take whatever action they deem appropriate			0
' however , we have every confidence the stewards are fully aware of the financial situation of the teams concerned and these matters are always assessed with extreme care and due regard for the circumstances involved			0
