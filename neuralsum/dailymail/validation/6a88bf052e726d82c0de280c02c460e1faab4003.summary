a brilliant scientist killed herself under a train because she was worried she was a bad mother to her two young children , an inquest has heard			2
@entity4 had a successful career as a chemist at a pharmaceutical firm , but she struggled with bi-polar disorder			1
the 43 - year - old mother told one of her son 's friends that she was a ' bad person ' , and claimed that the boys - both aged under 12 - would be ' better off without her '			0
in september last year , she failed to show up for dinner with her estranged husband @entity15 , and her body was later found next to the railway tracks near her home in @entity19 , @entity20			1
mr @entity21 told the inquest in @entity23 that he had often tried to reassure his wife about her parenting skills , but she refused to accept it			0
he said : ' @entity4 would constantly say she was a terrible mother , people like her should n't have children and the children would be better off without her			1
she had constant feelings of inadequacy as a mother			0
' when she was n't in a low mood she was the life and soul , she was a wonderful person			0
' the inquest heard that mr @entity21 had raised concerns about his wife 's mental state , but she was discharged early from a mental health unit and doctors failed to record her husband 's warnings			1
the couple , who both had doctorates first got together in 1995 , and were married in 2001			0
they moved to @entity19 after mrs @entity4 completed her chemistry phd at @entity48 and started working for @entity49 , a multi-national pharmaceutical company			1
however , they separated in february last year after mrs @entity4 's bouts of depression became more and more severe			1
the inquest was told that the pair had been due to meet up for dinner with their children on the day that she died , and that she may have chosen this moment to kill herself because she knew her sons were safe with their father			1
when she did not turn up mr @entity21 rushed around to the family home where he found her keys in the front door , her car missing and 14 letters arranged on the dining room table addressed to friends and family			1
her body was found by police two miles away			2
the afternoon before , she had tearfully told a schoolgirl who was friends with her sons : ' you are good people and i 'm a bad person			0
make sure you look after [ the boys ] for me			0
' mrs @entity4 's family claimed that her husband had driven her to her death by subjecting her to ' emotional abuse ' , the inquest heard			1
in a statement her sister @entity81 , said she believed that mr @entity21 's behaviour ' contributed significantly ' to his wife 's depression , adding : ' @entity15 told @entity4 constantly that she was mentally ill. ' but coroner @entity86 said that this was ' at best an over-simplification of the situation ' , adding : ' @entity4 herself conceded in conversation that some of her expressed views had been delusional			1
' work : mrs @entity4 was a chemist at pharmaceutical firm @entity49 , whose headquarters in @entity23 are pictured asked about the allegations , mr @entity21 said : ' from my point i loved @entity4 very much and i did all i could to care for her for over 20 years			1
' possibly i did the wrong things , but i did my best and i certainly could not have done any more			0
' the coroner took the rare step of criticising hospital authorities for the failings in mrs @entity4 's care after they ignored mr @entity21 's warnings			1
an independent investigator said that it had been ' unwise and potentially dangerous ' for doctors at @entity111 hospital in @entity112 to fail to record her husband 's comments			2
mr @entity21 tried to tell the hospital that they were wrong to discharge her , adding : ' i think @entity4 may have felt completely on her own at that stage			2
' recording a narrative verdict , mr @entity86 ruled that @entity4 ' took her own life whilst suffering from depression and bi-polar disorder			1
' he added that she had been ' discharged prematurely from the community support programme in september 2014 and without psychiatric review while expressing suicidal ideas			2
' speaking after the hearing , @entity4 's lifelong friend @entity124 said : ' she was incredibly talented , she was very musical and her singing voice was beautiful			2
' the only word to sum her up would be nurturing			0
she was so loving , she gave so much of her love to other people			0
' she was , contrary to what she thought , the most loving and attentive mother			0
she was absolutely amazing with the boys and it 's tragic she could n't see that			0
there was so much love coming from her			0
