a paeodphile teacher at a school attended by @entity4 journalist @entity3 was allowed to run a hockey club for a year after his arrest , it emerged last night			1
@entity7 , 69 , was held by police in august 2012 after a former pupil revealed he was regularly taken to the @entity12 teacher ’s house for sex			1
but officers and council officials deliberately chose to keep details of the abuse under wraps until @entity7 was sentenced			1
worries : mr @entity3 , the @entity4 's economics editor , expressed concern over secrecy surrounding the abuse because of the secrecy , the pervert was able to stay on as chairman of the @entity25 and @entity26 until september 2013			1
the club has a number of adult teams but also coaches children from the age of eight			0
at a club meeting in march 2013 , @entity7 describes how the young players were doing well			2
his personal details – including his email address – remained on @entity37 ’s website as the main contact for the club until may this year			0
it remains unclear whether the club or @entity37 knew about his arrest before he retired from the hockey club			0
both declined to comment last night			0
the news comes a day after mr @entity3 , the @entity4 ’s economics editor , expressed concern over the secrecy surrounding abuse by his old gym teacher , who was jailed for 12 years last month for repeatedly sexually assaulting a boy under 16 in the 1980s			1
a child protection expert has now launched an independent inquiry into the handling of allegations against @entity7 , who worked at @entity54 in @entity55 for over 30 years and was also assistant head			2
his victim has questioned why @entity58 – which was also at the centre of the @entity61 scandal – kept the abuse secret from parents for months after the claims came to light			2
questions : haringey council has come under the spotlight for not altering children 's parents to concerns about @entity7 as soon as they came to light it was not until he was sentenced that current @entity76 headmaster @entity75 informed parents about the case in a letter			1
he said @entity7 retired from the school in 2004 , but failed to mention that he had continued to visit for about four weeks each year until 2010 to help arrange work experience placements for students			1
@entity83 , the @entity84 ’ lead member for children on @entity58 , said there was ‘ no reason for months of secrecy ’ after @entity7 ’ arrest			2
‘ indeed , there were many reasons for @entity58 to be open – importantly , to allow others who could have been abused to come forward , ’ she added			0
‘ the letter sent to parents seemed deliberately evasive , implying @entity7 had had no contact with the school since 2004 , when in fact , he had been working with pupils until 2010 , although not as a teacher			1
’ @entity100 confirmed it has received several calls about the school since the case , but has launched no new investigations			0
@entity58 said it was shocked about the ‘ appalling ’ case			0
a spokesman added : ‘ we take our responsibility for safeguarding very seriously and work closely with all of our schools to ensure good awareness of safeguarding and robust procedures for reporting and investigating any concerns that may arise			0
