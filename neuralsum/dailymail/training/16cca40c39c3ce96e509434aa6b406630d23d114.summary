by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 26 september 2013 the @entity2 name conjures impressive modeling associations like million - dollar beauty contracts , @entity5 features , and @entity7 campaigns			1
in the last four years @entity8 and @entity2 , who are not related , have simultaneously built their status as supermodels with the same exact surname			1
now , a third unrelated @entity2 has emerged onto the scene			1
high school student @entity14 follows in the footsteps of @entity2 , 22 , an @entity17 spokeswoman and @entity8 , also 22 , @entity19 's long - running face			1
both are industry veterans who have walked in the @entity5 — modeling ’s highest distinction — a number of times			2
fresh face : @entity14 , pictured above in one of her agency polaroids , is set to elevate the @entity2 name to the next level together , they ’ve established the @entity2 name as modeling ’s gilded moniker			1
it ’s a distinction that @entity14 should find immensely helpful			2
now in her first runway season , she has already walked for the likes of @entity35 , @entity36 , and 3.1 @entity37			1
hailing from @entity38 , @entity39 , a place she says is ‘ full of corn , ’ @entity14 is poised to elevate the lofty name to the next level			2
while the @entity2 surname already offers inimitable beauty on tap , @entity14 ’s look is quite different , setting her apart from the other two			1
@entity2 ’s @entity48 - bred flaxen hair and doe - eyed appearance have earned her a coveted beauty contract , as well as campaign work with commercial @entity53 brands like @entity54 and @entity55			1
@entity8 ’s visibly @entity58 @entity57 upbringing has paved the way for advertising contracts with classic labels including @entity62 and @entity63			2
both have channeled their supermodel looks into a commercial goldmine			2
by contrast , @entity14 ’s higher - minded aesthetic ( brooding eyes , chestnut hair , and a slightly skewed nose — considered a positive quirk in modeling ) is carving its own aesthetic niche within the @entity2 tribe			1
it has already inspired the likes of artistically - inclined designers @entity78 and @entity35 , both of whom have cast her in their shows			1
when @entity83 spoke with @entity14 , who stands at a lithe 5 ’ 10 ” , she had just spent the evening prior at @entity85 ’s atelier to run through looks with the label ’s creative director @entity87			2
supermodel name : @entity91 ( @entity92 ) and @entity93 ( r ) , both photographed at the @entity95 , have simultaneously built their respective careers with the same name ‘ he is so nice , ’ @entity14 said of @entity87 by phone , her voice laden with the excitement of a bewildered teenage girl			1
‘ it ’s so cool when you meet people like that and it ’s like , “ what , they are n’t crazy ? they are just normal people ? ” ’ @entity14 , politely declined to provide her age ( her agent admits ‘ she is a young girl ’ ) , likely in caution of rules outlined by the @entity116 that requests designers not to use models under the age of sixteen			2
' i want to sounds like i have a background in the industry ’ she says that her education in fashion is a recent one : ‘ that whole interest definitely started when i got into the industry , ’ she said			0
‘ i had to have some sort of background knowledge about it because i do n’t want to sound line an unintellectual about it , i want to sounds like i have a background in the industry			0
’ she says that people at home in @entity39 ‘ do n’t really understand the fashion world — if you are n’t in a @entity138 ’s catalogue , they do n’t really get it			0
’ however , ‘ they are kind of learning , ’ she says			0
‘ when i did @entity145 resort this past summer they were like “ @entity145 , i ’ve heard of that so it must be good , right ? ” ’ @entity14 , it seems , is quickly priming herself on her new , likely alien surroundings			1
the words ‘ industry ’ and ‘ career ’ carried throughout our entire conversation , making it evident that the very young student -- who named math as her favorite subject -- is quickly learning adapt to a world where exceeding precociousness , particularly at her age , provides a competitive edge			2
on the runway : @entity2 has already booked shows including @entity145 resort 2014 ( @entity92 ) , and @entity36 spring 2014 ( r ) for example , @entity14 says that she holds @entity166 as an editorial goal over its @entity58 counterpart			1
‘ @entity169 has more turned into celebrities [ always ] being on the cover but @entity173 @entity166 is staying strong with models on the cover , ’ she announced with proud inflection			0
her road to early success began only last summer when she and her older sister briefly moved to @entity179 to attempt modeling together			0
it ’s there that @entity14 learned how to pose , dress , and walk a runway			0
‘ i had a tough time , ’ she said of her catwalk lessons			0
‘ i bought five different pairs of shoes to try , thinking it was the shoes [ instead of me ]			0
’ ‘ @entity169 has more turned into celebrities [ always ] being on the cover but @entity173 @entity166 is staying strong with models on the cover ’ after ‘ the critiques on how to move your arms , when to blink , it all came together , ’ she says			0
‘ my dad pushed me more than anyone else … every night he would come into my room and say “ you need to walk			0
” ’ he was also her introduction to modeling ’s other two @entity14 ’s			0
@entity14 recalls that after her father found @entity8 and @entity2 ’s profiles on the widely - used site , @entity208 ( which serves as a @entity210 - type resource for the modeling industry ) he came to her and said ‘ they have two other @entity14 ’s you know			1
’ while @entity14 has yet to meet @entity2 and @entity8 , both of whom now reserve their runway appearances for major ( higher - paying ) brands like @entity218 and @entity219 , she says that she ‘ can not wait for the day ’ that they finally cross paths			1
more accolades : @entity14 , who is now in @entity223 looking to book more big runway shows , was also cast in @entity35 ( @entity92 ) and 3.1 @entity37 ( r ) that milestone should n't too be far off			1
following a one - year hiatus from modeling , @entity14 returned to @entity179 this past june with new @entity229 images that drew the attention of reputable casting agents around the city			0
‘ within minutes of sending them out , we got major responses , ’ her @entity58 agent , @entity233 at @entity234 , told @entity83			0
mere weeks later @entity14 was cast as an ‘ exclusive ’ in the @entity145 resort 2014 show , a distinction that has launched the careers of many top models			1
a few months later she was cast in the @entity37 , @entity35 , @entity243 , and @entity35 ’s spring 2014 shows at @entity245			1
she followed that up by skipping the @entity248 shows and flying straight to @entity249 where she booked spots in @entity36 and @entity252 ’s line - ups			1
@entity14 is now in @entity223 , her first visit to the city , in the hopes of booking major shows there as well			2
' it ’s so crazy to think that two other people have the same last name as me ... especially since @entity14 is not that common of a last name ’ ‘ most people do n’t get these kinds of opportunities , i get to see the world and get to go to @entity173 and @entity223 , ’ she said			0
‘ even @entity179 is a big deal where i ’m from			0
’ on the brink of what could be a lightening career , @entity14 admits that many of her aspirations mirror those of her namesake colleagues			0
‘ i look up to them so much , ’ she said of @entity2 and @entity8			1
last week , she ‘ was in @entity249 and i was walking by the @entity278 building and @entity8 was on a billboard			0
i was like “ oh my god that is @entity93 ! ” ‘ i feel like we have some sort of relation even though we do n’t , ’ she admitted			2
‘ it ’s so crazy to think that two other people have the same last name as me in this industry , especially since @entity14 is not that common of a last name			0
’ but @entity14 is the first one to assert : ‘ i ’m hoping to be the third successful one			0

the high school student has already walked in shows by @entity145 , @entity35 , and @entity36
she has the same name as @entity17 model @entity2 and @entity19 face @entity93 , both 22
