it has found the ' @entity2 particle ' , and could soon reveal a mysterious force known as ' dark matter '			2
but when it turns on next week , some scientists are betting the @entity7 will detect something just as exciting ; a parallel universe			1
this is according to a new study that claims miniature black holes - a key sign of a ' multiverse ' - could be detected in @entity15 's @entity7 in @entity16			1
but when it turns on next week , some scientists are betting the @entity7 in @entity16 will detect something even more exciting ; a parallel universe the @entity25 theory suggests that gravity 's effect on the cosmos causes different wavelengths of light to behave differently			1
this means that particles with different energies will move in space - times and gravitational fields differently			0
the theory was proposed 10 years ago in an attempt to reconcile difference between the theories of general relativity and quantum mechanics			0
one consequence of rainbow gravity is that our universe stretches back into time infinitely with no singular point where it started			1
' just as many parallel sheets of paper , which are two dimensional objects ( breath and length ) can exist in a third dimension ( height ) , parallel universes can also exist in higher dimensions ' @entity55 from the @entity57 told @entity58			2
' we predict that gravity can leak into extra dimensions , and if it does , then miniature black holes can be produced at the @entity7			1
' professor @entity55 and his team have calculated the energy at which they expect to detect these mini black holes in gravity 's rainbow , according to a report by @entity68 at @entity69			1
' if we do detect mini black holes at this energy , then we will know that both gravity 's rainbow and extra dimensions are correct , ' added professor @entity55			1
when it 's activated , the energy with which the @entity7 smashes particles together will be twice what it was during the time when it made the discovery of the @entity79			1
billions of particles flying off from each @entity7 collision are tracked at @entity15 detectors to establish when and how they come together and what shapes they take			2
the @entity15 theoreticians say this could give clear signs of dimensions beyond length , breadth , depth and time			0
at such high energy gravity many be even tracked disappearing into them			2
parallel universes can exist within these dimensions , the thinking goes , but only gravity can leave our universe into these extra dimensions			2
if extra dimensions do exist , the study suggests that they would lower the energy required to produce black holes which the @entity7 could pick			1
professor @entity55 suggests the reason these black holes have yet to be detected is because our current model of gravity gets modified at very high energies			1
according to @entity69 , in the latest study , the new theory of gravity 's rainbow has been used to account for why the @entity7 has not yet found tiny black holes			1
the new theory of gravity 's rainbow has been used to account for why the @entity7 has not yet found tiny black holes			1
@entity116 's theory of relativity states that gravity is caused by space and time curving			2
gravity 's rainbow says that space and time curve differently for particles of different energy @entity116 's theory of relativity states that gravity is caused by space and time curving			1
gravity 's rainbow says that space and time curve differently for particles of different energy			2
so , gravity 's rainbow suggests that gravity 's effect on the cosmos causes different wavelengths of light to behave differently			0
this means that particles with different energies will move in space - times and gravitational fields differently			0
using gravity 's rainbow , the scientists found that more energy is required to detect mini black holes at the @entity7 than previously thought			1
so far , the @entity7 has searched for mini black holes at energy levels below 5.3 tev			1
but the latest study says this is too low			0
instead , the model predicts that black holes may form at energy levels of at least 9.5 tev in six dimensions and 11.9 tev in 10 dimensions			1
if mini black holes are detected at the @entity7 at the predicted energies , not only will it prove the existence of extra dimensions and by extension parallel universes , said @entity156 from @entity157			1
' if black holes are not detected at the predicted energy levels , this would mean one of three possibilities , ' @entity158 explained to @entity69 ' one , extra dimensions do not exist			1
two , they exist , but they are smaller than expected			0
or three , the parameters of gravity 's rainbow need to be modified			0
' the holographic model suggests gravity in the universe comes from thin , vibrating strings			2
these strings are holograms of events that take place in a simpler , flatter cosmos the universe is a hologram and everything you can see - including this article and the device you are reading it on - is a mere projection			0
this is according to a controversial model proposed in 1997 by theoretical physicist @entity186			0
until now the bizarre theory had never been tested , but recent mathematical models suggest that the mind - boggling principle could be true			0
according to the theory , gravity in the universe comes from thin , vibrating strings			2
these strings are holograms of events that take place in a simpler , flatter cosmos			0
professor @entity186 's model suggests that the universe exists in nine dimensions of space , and one of time			0
in december , @entity206 researchers attempted to tackle this problem by providing mathematical evidence that the holographic principle might be correct			0
the holographic principle suggests that , like the security chip on a credit card for example , there is a two - dimensional surface that contains all the information needed to describe a three - dimensional object - which in this case is our universe			0
in essence , the principle claims that data containing a description of a volume of space - such as a human or a comet - could be hidden in a region of this flattened , ' real ' version of the universe			0
in a black hole , for instance , all the objects that ever fall into it would be entirely contained in surface fluctuations			0
this means that the objects would be stored almost as ' memory ' or fragment of data rather than a physical object in existence .			0

scientists predict gravity can sometimes leak into an extra dimension
if this happens , it will create tiny black holes that can be found by @entity7
@entity7 has failed to find any , but study claims it has gravity model *wrong*
theory says it should be looking for black holes at higher energy levels
the @entity7 is *due* to be turned back on next week with double the energy
