but mr @entity2 , who was @entity14 in the @entity16 government at the time , said the ' payment leaves a bad taste in the mouth for everybody ' and insisted he would make the same decision again			1
@entity2 defended his decision to remove @entity8 , who was given a £ 679,000 payout by @entity13 after a judge ruled she had been unfairly dismissed in 2011 ms @entity26 was sacked after a damning report into the death of @entity8 in 2007 who was subjected to months of abuse			1

she had presided over @entity13 social workers while they failed to save the life of 17 - month - old @entity49			1
the toddler died in 2007 after suffering months of abuse from his mother , her boyfriend and his brother , even though the family had been seen on 60 occasions by social workers , health workers and others			1

' @entity78 gave me , as the secretary of state , the power to remove somebody from a statutory position if i judged public confidence required that			0
that was my judgment and i 'd make the same decision today			0
' of course this payment leaves a bad taste in the mouth for everybody			2

@entity8 suffered more than 50 injuries despite being on the at - risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers , police and health professionals over the final eight months of his life			1
