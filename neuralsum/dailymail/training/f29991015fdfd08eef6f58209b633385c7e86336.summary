@entity1 of @entity2 shares an ancestor with the late queen mother , it has been revealed			0
the discovery was made by @entity6 , from @entity7 when he was researching the famous @entity8			1
built in @entity10 in around 1700 , the cabinet is now housed at the @entity12 @entity11 and is coincidentally due to be seen by @entity13 and his pregnant wife @entity14 during their first official visit there			1
it has been revealed that the @entity4 ( left ) and the @entity19 ( right ) share a mutual ancestor the extravagant piece , which has both the @entity22 and @entity24 family crests on it 's doors , was made to celebrate the wedding between the two biggest families in @entity28 - the @entity29 and the @entity30			1
and it was this wedding that makes the connection between @entity34 's mother and the @entity19 with sir @entity22 , of @entity35 , near @entity36 , being the common ancestor that they share			2
@entity34 , sir @entity13 's great granddaughter , married into the @entity24 - @entity41 family			1
@entity34 's descendent is the @entity4 , @entity34 , who last visited the family estate in 1968			0
@entity6 , who made the connection between the two women while studying the @entity8 , says the relation could be the reason @entity14 wore the @entity4 's tiara on her wedding day @entity6 said his research revealed that the @entity51 and the @entity52 of @entity53 , @entity14 's ancestors , were the wealthiest landowners in @entity55			2
they married into the @entity24 - @entity41 family so that they could share each others ' vast coal estates at @entity35			1
@entity6 added that this connection could even be the reason for the crown that was worn by the @entity1 on her wedding day			0
' it makes sense that @entity14 wore the @entity4 's tiara when she married prince @entity13 - both women share a great deal , @entity28 ancestry , the vast @entity66 and the same famous cabinet			1
' prince @entity13 and @entity14 are currently on an official visit to @entity12 and are coincidentally due to visit the @entity11 where the famous cabinet is housed @entity14 's direct ancestor , sir @entity70 , also attended the funeral of his @entity35 cousin @entity72 , @entity73			1
she was the @entity4 's great - great - great - grandmother , considered at the time of her death in 1800 to be the wealthiest woman in @entity77			0
@entity78 agreed that the discovery was not actually surprising , especially since there was a strong connection with the @entity82 in @entity83			0
' it does not surprise me at all			0
' said the @entity86 adding : ' when @entity14 married @entity13 , i hoped that she would take @entity28 from where the @entity4 left it because each member of the royal family used to have their own area and when the @entity4 was alive she was always here			2
' @entity92 added that it is not uncommon to find this kind of ancestral connection within the royal family			0
' of course we have to remember that the @entity4 was not royal , she was only a member of the royal family because she married a prince , but if we look at the ancestry of the royal family we would see that they were intermarried all the time			0

@entity7 @entity6 made the discovery while studying the @entity24 cabinet
the family connection between the two women came when the two biggest families in @entity28 married - the @entity29 and the @entity24 - @entity111
coincidentally , prince @entity13 and the @entity19 are due to visit the famous cabinet during their official visit to @entity12 this week
