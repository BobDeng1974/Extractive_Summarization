by @entity0 @entity1 has warned that his transfer wish - list will become irrelevant if @entity3 do n't qualify for the @entity5 group stages			1
the @entity6 takes charge of his first game on @entity10 soil on tuesday night when the @entity12 side seek to close out their second qualifying round tie with @entity15 at @entity16			1
leading 1 - 0 from the first leg in @entity18 , @entity3 are fully expected to advance to the next round despite their temporary surroundings and a pitch which is a combination of grass and an artificial surface			1
ready : @entity3 manager @entity1 makes his way onto the @entity16 pitch but @entity1 warned that only by completing the job and negotiating the next two hurdles lying in wait will he retain a prospect of being handed the funds to land the calibre of player he covets			1
' of course , qualifying for the @entity5 is very important when it comes to attracting players			1
that 's a huge thing and it is a big target for us , ' said the manager who will be without injured @entity42			2
' we work together at @entity3			1
i talk with @entity44 ( @entity45 ) and he has the same task as me - to make @entity3 as good as possible without putting the club out of order economically			1
there 's no problem at all			0
' but you know what kind of money there is			0
it does n't compete with the biggest clubs in @entity58			0
but it is big in @entity10 terms			1
focused : @entity3 prepare for @entity5 second qualifying round tie with @entity15 ' we are looking for quality and that 's very hard just now , when a lot of the big clubs in the rest of the world have n't even started pre-season			1
' you have to beat clubs like @entity72 who can just buy the ones they want when they want			0
the biggest get their food first - then the rest of us come after			2
that 's the challenge we have			0
' the longer the window goes , the bigger the opportunities get			0
there is more pressure on every club and they have to take decisions			0
so , for me , quality is the word - that means someone who can go in and do something at once			2
but there is also quality in those who can be longer - term prospects			2
' @entity42 has a thigh injury , joining skipper @entity96 and @entity97 on the sidelines but @entity99 is expected to be fit despite training on his own yesterday			0
close up : @entity15 manager @entity100 ( right ) inspects the @entity16 surface @entity1 , also missing the departed @entity102 from last season 's squad , believes those players remaining at his disposal have the wherewithal to make the group stages			1
' @entity42 , of course , is a very good footballer so it is not ideal he is not available - but we have many strikers in the squad so it is n't the worst position for us to lose players from , ' he added			2
' it is only for this game , though , he will be back for the next one			2
' i 'm confident the current squad can get us to the group stage			0
a lot of them have been there and done it before			0
but it 's not exactly the same , because we have lost @entity102 , @entity96 and @entity97 for these big games			0
but other players have to take steps and get us into the @entity5			1
' meanwhile , stand - in skipper @entity130 declared the squad completely satisfied with @entity16 's new hybrid surface after training on it			1
' it 's a class stadium			0
the pitch is great so we ca n't complain , ' he said .			0
