@entity2 , now in its third series , is a traditional detective show but also one about women with stressful jobs and imperfect home lives funny thing about severed heads : they ’re more - ish , like @entity11 eggs			1
no sooner had we enjoyed @entity14 ’s disembodied bonce , staring from underneath frosty eyebrows amid bags of frozen peas in @entity18 on monday night , than we were treated to another , on @entity2			1
this was murder most foul - smelling			1
the police who discovered the body came reeling out of the house with their hands over their faces			1
‘ body at the top of the stairs , head at the bottom , blood everywhere , ’ choked one			1
it was an old - fashioned whodunnit			1
the old lady , a heavy drinker , had not been alone when she died — but her husband @entity38 was bedridden , and apparently senile			2
‘ @entity38 could n’t knock the skin off a rice pudding , ’ insisted sergeant @entity39 ( @entity40 )			2
there were other suspects — and powerful motives			2
the couple ’s four children had suffered years of sexual abuse — and one of them had been driving around her childhood streets on the night of the killing			1
@entity52 stole the show as one of the daughters , a department store make - up saleswoman , who heard the news of her mother ’s death with an impassive stare , but scene by scene dissolved into a dishevelled wreck			1
it was an award - worthy performance , made more striking by the fact that we saw @entity67 on tuesday as a daffy airhead in @entity70 ’s sitcom @entity71 and last week as the cool - headed , gang - busting policewoman in prisoners ’ wives			1
@entity2 , back for a third series , is a traditional detective show that can trace its heritage back to @entity77 : there ’s even a blue ‘ police ’ lamp in a station doorway during the opening credits			1
but it ’s also a show about ordinary women with stressful jobs and imperfect home lives			1
this was n’t feminist , it was simply female : it even started with a good gossip in the ladies ’ loo			2
later , @entity94 ( @entity95 ) was coming to terms with how boring her husband was , after the honeymoon had fizzled out			2
she knew he loved her , but he loved his xbox , too			2
and he was so shallow there was n’t much difference between the two emotions			2
‘ women really are from @entity105 , ’ @entity2 consoled her , ‘ and men are from the planet @entity109			1
’ as the new series of @entity116 , a celebration of this island race , began on @entity119 , my prize for a woman who beat the men at their own game went to @entity120			0
@entity120 was the first woman ever to ascend the podium of the @entity123 motorbike races after riding to a sidecar victory beside husband @entity125 in 1968			0
coast presenter @entity126 traced the history of the @entity129 privateers on @entity130 in last night 's programme @entity116 is a ' celebration of this island race ' the camera recreated the bone - rattling circuit @entity120 and @entity125 had taken around the island ’s winding moorland roads , and we saw archive stills of @entity120 , leaning so far out of the sidecar that she was almost surfing the @entity141			1
here she was — a true heroine			0
@entity142 was the order of the night			0
on @entity130 , presenter @entity126 traced the history of the @entity129 privateers , legalised pirates awarded a royal charter by @entity147 to plunder @entity149 ships			0
‘ @entity150 was a middle - class occupation , ’ @entity126 explained , ‘ whereas the @entity152 was for the upper classes			0
’ the pirate spirit lived on , during the @entity156 occupation of the @entity157 after 1940			0
one survivor , @entity158 , recalled how he and his schoolmates used to lob fistfuls of turf , like throwing hand grenades , out of a roadside ditch at the passing cars			0
one sailed through an open window and hit a @entity168 officer full in the face			0
brutal reprisals were avoided when @entity158 ’s headmaster ordered him to write a letter of apology to the @entity174			1
@entity175 came to the fore again off the @entity177 during @entity178 , when @entity180 biplanes were launched from boats at night			0
these were the earliest sort of aircraft carriers			0
the captain would steer into a headwind , the pilot would rev his engine , and if there was enough breeze to lift the wings , the ropes securing the aeroplane to the boat would be cut			0
sometimes the plane would flip into the sea , sometimes the pilot would be aloft , reading his instrument panels by torchlight and hunting for @entity202 airships			0
i suspect @entity120 , @entity204 of the @entity123 , would have loved it .			0
