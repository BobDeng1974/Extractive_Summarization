click here to see our brilliant @entity1 , including @entity4 's wonder - strike for @entity5 an early blunder by third - choice @entity8 keeper @entity7 and a moment of opportunism from @entity4 were the decisive factors as @entity5 maintained their extraordinary start to the season			1
@entity7 failed to deal effectively with a back - pass , hitting it to @entity4 who , in turn , lobbed it back from distance , over the keeper ’s head and into the net			1
so @entity5 go marching on — with 10 wins in their last 11 games in all competitions and playing as solidly at the back as they are threateningly going forward			2
@entity4 's first - time effort from 40 yards out gave @entity5 an early lead at the @entity29 @entity30 midfielder @entity4 ( centre ) celebrates with team - mates @entity32 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) all 10 of @entity5 's outfield players celebrate after @entity4 's early effort put the away side 0 - 1 up after just three minutes @entity8 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity7 4.5 ; @entity37 6 , @entity38 6.5 ( @entity39 , 64 , 5.5 ) , @entity40 6 ; @entity41 5.5 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 6.5 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 6 ; @entity46 6 ( @entity47 , 73 , 5.5 ) , @entity48 6			1

‘ and now you ’re gon na believe us , we ’re gon na win the @entity75 ! ’ sang the 1,479 jubilant @entity5 fans in attendance			1
nobody is going to believe them but this has been a wonderful start to the season and this latest victory made the 254 - mile journey home much more pleasant for the travelling support			0
@entity73 was asked about the fans ’ singing			2
‘ maybe , maybe , ’ he said when asked if his side could really win the title , but he did so with a big grin			2
‘ but no , ’ he added			0
then : ‘ if we continue moving up the table , why not ? ’ this was @entity5 ’s third win in eight days following two victories over @entity105 , at home in the @entity75 last week then away in the @entity107 , booking a quarter - final berth in that competition			1
‘ i ’m proud of my players , a third win in a week is not easy , ’ @entity73 said			1
‘ i ’m surprised a bit by how many points we have , but i ’m not surprised by the quality of the team … we work hard on the composition of the team			0
’ asked about @entity120 aspirations , he added : ‘ you never know … but everyone knows we have to work hard every day			0
the spirit is incredible and we have to keep it			0
’ his counterpart , @entity125 , said : ‘ that was a very difficult game for us			0
@entity5 are a very , very good side and it ’s no fluke they ’re at the top of the division			1
‘ we were n’t quite there today … it was a great finish from @entity4 , but you make a mistake like that and you ’re on your heels			2
’ @entity4 's 40 - yard effort as illustrated by our brilliant @entity1			1
click here to see all the stats from the game at the @entity29 third - choice goalkeeper @entity7 was at fault for @entity4 's goal in the third minute of the game @entity73 celebrates with his @entity5 players at the full - time whistle - the result secured a ninth win in 10 matches @entity148 miles @entity8 110.3 68.5 @entity149 90 11.7 7.3 @entity150 90 10.8 6.7 @entity40 90 10.7 6.7 @entity5 115.1 71.5 @entity59 90 12.5 7.8 @entity32 90 12.2 7.6 @entity4 90 11.4 7.1 @entity4 was one of two changes @entity73 made to the side that started against @entity105 last saturday			1
@entity4 starting in place of @entity154 in midfield and @entity156 started in place of @entity60			2
@entity4 ’s all - round play was excellent , as good as it has been since his £ 12.5 million move from @entity160 in summer 2013			1
the crowd — including @entity81 manager @entity162 — were barely in their seats when the visitors went ahead inside three minutes			0
if we want to be generous , the goal was not all @entity7 ’s fault			2
the @entity170 - born @entity169 international would not have been playing without injuries to @entity172 and @entity173			0
@entity7 was then put under some pressure by a backpass from @entity45			0
the weight of the ball was not good and @entity7 was forced to move out of his goal to make sure that he got to it before @entity34 , running the channel to try and pick it up			0
@entity7 did get there first , but instead of kicking the ball hard and out of play — as would probably have been best — he hoofed it not very hard out of his area — to @entity4			0
the @entity30 had a look up to see @entity7 well out of position and smashed the ball it first time from about 40 yards into the net			0
so the goal was a product of @entity45 ’s poor play , and @entity4 ’s skill			1
but yes , it was still a howler			0
and yes , @entity4 celebrates after scoring the only goal of the game for @entity5 at the @entity29 @entity43 ( centre ) shoots at goal , while @entity5 defender @entity56 throws himself in the way of the effort a speculative overhead kick from @entity34 ( left ) almost creates a second goal for @entity5 as @entity40 desperately tries to block a disappointing result for @entity8 and @entity125 ( pictured ) leaves them 13th in the @entity75 table @entity5 right - back @entity55 ( left ) and @entity8 's @entity208 battle for an aerial ball during the first half @entity38 returned to @entity8 's starting line - up , and he is pictured ( right ) fighting for the ball with @entity5 ' striker @entity34 @entity73 walks over to the away support to applaud their efforts - his @entity5 side stay second in the league after a narrow win @entity5 's starting 11 line up for a minute 's silence in memory of those who died in battle during @entity225 @entity32 ( left ) takes a shot on goal , while @entity8 midfielder @entity149 is at full stretch attempting to stop it four players scramble for the ball during the first half in @entity8 's @entity75 match against @entity5 @entity8 manager @entity125 rolls back the years to knock the ball back onto the pitch during the first half at the @entity29 @entity34 ( right ) is challenged in the air by @entity8 defender @entity238 during the match @entity5 manager @entity73 has enjoyed an exceptional start to life in charge of the south coast club @entity81 manager @entity162 was in attendance to see the likes of @entity5 duo @entity54 and @entity55 @entity73 ( left ) and @entity125 embrace before their sides took to the pitch at the @entity29			1

@entity5 went into the game having won six of their first nine matches in the @entity75
@entity4 opened the scoring in the third minute with a *spectacular* 40 - yard first - time effort
the @entity5 stay second after their win , while @entity8 slip to 13th in the @entity75 table
@entity73 ’s side have now not conceded a league goal in 320 minutes of *football*
