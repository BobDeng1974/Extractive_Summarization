but she says she ca n't bring herself to part with the property which is full of memories of @entity3 - and parting with it would leave her homeless			2
@entity54 : this home in @entity47 , @entity48 , was bought with the @entity10 compensation so @entity3 could be properly cared for but now it will have to be sold , his mother says ' the settlement was the closest i was ever going to get for an apology for the fact his spinal bifida went unnoticed , ' she said			1
' i had the right to choose whether to have my son or not taken away from me			0
' three months after he died i was told to start paying back the money because @entity3 had n't lived as long as they expected him too			1

' this has never been about the money , it is about decency and doing the right thing by a vulnerable little boy - and his mum			0
' calum with his mum shortly after his born , but despite his disability he was told that his life may not have been short scan : medics failed to spot that @entity3 had spina bifida , and his mother awarded £ 700,000 to pay towards his care @entity1 knew from early on in her pregnancy there was an increased risk her baby could have life - limiting conditions because of the medication she was taking for her epilepsy			1
she underwent several routine and specialist scans but @entity3 's problems went undetected and she was told everything was okay			2
she was devastated when her baby - her first and only child - was born with spinal bifida and hydrocephalus , which causes water on the brain			0

growing up : @entity3 in leg braces aged 5 , but less than a year later the poorly little boy passed away unlucky : minutes after his birth he was rushed to @entity112 in @entity141 and it was hoped he would have an average life expectancy @entity1 sued @entity15 for ' wrongful birth ' claiming they had taken away the right to make a properly informed decision on terminating her baby			1
the hospital trust admitted negligence and agreed to pay for a ' life - time of care ' for her son beginning with interim payments , ahead of a final settlement when @entity3 turned ten			1
had the case ever gone through it was due to reach several millions with @entity1 potentially receiving an estimated £ 6 million for a lifetime of care for the youngster			2
@entity1 invested £ 450,000 of the interim payments in a new home for her and @entity3 in the belief the property would be in her name for life			1
but just three months after @entity3 passed away letters from the hospital 's solicitors demanded she pay back £ 330,000 of back - dated payments for her son 's care			1
solicitors have advised her to sell her home , which would cover the costs and leave her with £ 75,000 to keep as part of a new settlement			0
@entity1 added : ' if i had known how poorly @entity3 was going to be i may have considered a termination but that choice was taken away from me			2

it 's all i have left of him			0

' i do n't think anyone is going to physically kick her out			0
the negotiations are still ongoing in regards to that			0
' the @entity10 today said the repayment to the public purse was necessary because the final settlement was more than the interim money already paid to @entity1			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity216 said she said : ' the @entity216 and @entity217 appreciate this is a difficult time for ms @entity13			0
' we also have a responsibility to safeguard public funds , there are no plans currently to force a sale of this property			0
