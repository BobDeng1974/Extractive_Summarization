by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 10:35 est , 6 march 2014 a 15 - year - old schoolgirl has become the world 's youngest sword swallower after secretly teaching herself to consume 18 - inch blades			2
@entity6 , from @entity7 in the @entity8 , locked herself in her bedroom to practice the unusual hobby after reading about it in a book when she was just 14			1
she spent three months practising in secret before plucking up the courage to tell her parents she had mastered the dangerous art form and is now one of around 25 female sword swallowers in the world			1
' my passion is acting , but i wanted to expand my variety of perfomances - i can get out of a straight jacket and hand cuffs , sword swallow , and i would like to try fire eating when i 'm old enough			2
' i started out using a wire hanger and a wooden spoon before i progressed toswords , and i had done a lot of research into the human anatomy so i know how everything works			0
' she went on : ' my dad knew that something was up - i do n't usually lock myself away for hours at a time			0
' i was really nervous about telling my parents but they have been really supportive			2
they helped me to find out more about it and to choose the right sword			2
' my mum was really worried for me at first , but she knows that i 'm careful			0
my family always come and watch my performances			0
' and my friends all think it is really cool , but they did freak out a bit at first			0
i did n't tell any of them about it , so it was a shock for them			0
' in an amazing demonstration of her sword swallowing prowess @entity6 lines the blade up ( left ) before tipping her head back and pushing the 18 - inch blade down after swallowing the full length of the blade ( left ) @entity6 poses for the crowd ( right ) now comes the tricky part : she pulls the blade back out again ( left ) then smiles for the camera ( right ) @entity6 's dad @entity76 and mum @entity77 could n't believe what their daughter had been keeping secret from them for almost three months			1
the dad - of - three said : ' i was quite surprised when she first told us , but i was pleased that she came to us rather than going off on her own , so i was happy			0
' we have brought the girls up to be really outgoing and none of them are girly so i could n't really be surprised			0
' we are n't always the most regular family on the block - i threw tomahawks when i was younger so that could be where she gets it from			0
' i joked that she just had a bad case of middle child syndrome and really needed to stand out			0
' the couple say they have always encouraged their three girls to pursue a wide range of extra-curricular activities			0
@entity6 is also a black belt in karate , shoots guns and bows , and rides dirt bikes with her sisters , @entity108 , 17 , who throws knives , and @entity110 , 11 , who is skilled at picking locks			2
she is now hoping to gain a @entity113 certification , and is the youngest female member of the @entity115 by six years			1
@entity6 ( left ) with mum @entity77 ( back left ) , dad @entity76 ( back right ) and her sisters @entity110 , 11 , @entity108 , 17 @entity6 has been invited to audition for the next series of @entity119 and has performed at a number of events across the @entity8 in recent months @entity122 , president of the @entity123 , said : ' in my years of research i 've found that most sword swallowers seem to learn between the ages of 18 and 21 , probably because at that age young people feel daring and invincible			1
' but it is rare to find people serious enough about learning the art much younger than that			0
' for @entity6 to learn the art at the age of 14 is very unusual , and for her to have her family 's support is even rarer still			1
that she learnt sword swallowing through months of solitary practice without a mentor is simply amazing			1
' however , due to the extreme dangers in sword swallowing , we do not condone or encourage people to learn sword swallowing - especially not youngsters under the age of 18			1
' @entity6 has already demonstrated persistence and dedication to studying the art , and i am convinced that she is highly committed and not turning back , so i have agreed to help mentor @entity6 with their parents ' permission			1
' i hope to inspire @entity6 to follow in my footsteps to take this ancient art to new heights in the next generation			1
' @entity6 has been invited to audition for the next series of @entity119 and has performed at a number of events across the @entity8 in recent months			1
the teen performed at @entity160 at the end of last month alongside a number of sword swallowing veterans to mark @entity165 .			2

@entity6 , 15 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , spent three months *perfecting* her sword swallowing before *confessing* to her parents
learned about the ancient art after reading a book when she was 14
she now hopes to gain a @entity113 certification
