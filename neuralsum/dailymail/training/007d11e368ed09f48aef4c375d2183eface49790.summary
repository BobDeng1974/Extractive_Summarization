by @entity0 last updated at 2:15 pm on 1st november 2011 two @entity2 families who were awarded $ 100,000 after their daughters were accidentally switched at birth have pledged to spend the payouts on new homes so the girls can grow up next door to each other			1
the 12 - year - olds from @entity11 , @entity2 , have become friends since their mix - up was discovered but will not switch to their biological families			1
judges ordered the maternity home where the error took place a dozen years ago should pay out the money to the shattered families			2
special bond : 12 - year - olds @entity22 , left , and @entity24 have become friends after it was revealed they were mixed up at birth the two girls were born 15 minutes apart on the same day and the medical centre , located in the @entity29 , admitted that they had mixed up the identity labels of the pair of babies			1
the mistake was only discovered earlier this year when one couple , the @entity35 , were going through divorce proceedings			1
@entity38 's former husband , had refused to support their daughter , @entity39 , because she did n't look like him			2
the subsequent dna test revealed that neither parent could have been the biological parents of the girl			1
' the results were a total surprise , ' mrs @entity38 told the @entity47			0
' not only does my ex-husband have no biological link to @entity39 , neither do @entity51 ' after contacting the police , the @entity35 were able to track the @entity53 and their daughter , @entity54			2
there was a reconciliation with both families , in the city of @entity59 in the @entity29 and heir situation has caused a media storm in @entity2			1
the two girls have become close after meeting and @entity39 said : ' we were a bit shy at first but we 're now the best of friends			2
' from right : @entity24 , her father , @entity68 , @entity39 and her mother @entity69			0
@entity11 's @entity71 city court ordered a maternity hospital to pay 3 million rubles after the girls were mixed up mixed up 12 years ago now that the maternal home has agreed to pay out both families have said that the girls will not return to their original families			1
however the families are thinking about spending the compensation to get houses close to each other			1
' i would like us to share a house so that we do n't worry about her daughter coming to me and the other way round , ' @entity39 's biological father , @entity81 said			2
however , there are complications , as he explains : ' one family is @entity90 , the other is @entity92			0
' what i fear most is that the daughter i 've raised will start going drinking in bars , that she will stop praying and working			0
' lawyer @entity96 - representing both families - said : ' we are satisfied with the result and with the amount of compensation			1
we believe that it is fair			0
' the parents laughed in joy and embraced each other in the footage from the courtroom after the judge delivered the verdict			0
the compensation is huge by @entity2 standards , where an average monthly wage currently stands at the equivalent of some £ 300			1
however , despite winning the court battle , mrs @entity22 continues to feel bitter			0
' all the money in the world is n't worth a child 's look at mother , ' she said			0
' i wish they could put our lives in place			0
' i tried to show @entity126 motherly love , but she does n't accept it			0
' when your own daughter looks at you like a stranger , that 's so painful			0

the mix - up only came to light when one couple took a dna test while going through a divorce
girls will not switch back to biological families
amount of compensation is huge for @entity2 where average monthly wages is £ 300
