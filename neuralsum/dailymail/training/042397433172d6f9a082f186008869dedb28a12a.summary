by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 08:59 est , 19 june 2012 @entity1 and world powers blamed each other today for the lack of progress in talks on @entity7 's nuclear programme			1
the stalemate has dimmed hopes of a breakthrough which it was hoped would avert the threat of a new @entity14 war			0
on the second and final day of talks in @entity17 , frustration mounted over the failure to move any closer to ending a decade of negotiations over @entity1 work			1
deadlock : @entity1 president @entity21 ( centre ) visiting the @entity23 in april 2008 which the international community believe may be one of the sites that @entity1 is potentially enriching uranium to weapons grade if talks collapse , nerves could grow on financial markets over the danger of higher oil prices and new conflict in the @entity14			1
@entity35 has previously threatened to bomb @entity1 nuclear sites if diplomacy fails to stop @entity7 getting the bomb			1
an @entity1 diplomat said : ' we did not come to @entity17 only for discussions			0
we came to @entity17 for a resolution			0
but we believe the opposite side is not ready to reach a resolution			1
' @entity1 says its nuclear programme has only non-military purposes , but the @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 want @entity7 to stop enriching uranium to levels that bring it close to acquiring weapons - grade material			1
battle : @entity59 foreign policy chief @entity58 , ( pictured in 2011 ) who is leading the world powers ' delegation , found monday 's talks had been ' intense and tough ' according to her spokesman @entity1 's negotiators want relief from economic sanctions and are pushing the six powers to acknowledge its right to enrich uranium , something they refuse to do until @entity7 allows @entity72 inspections of its work			1
a spokesman for @entity59 foreign policy chief @entity58 , who is leading the world powers ' delegation , said monday 's talks had been intense and tough			1
a @entity77 diplomat made clear late on monday @entity1 needed to do more to address proposals made by the six powers at the last round of talks			2
the diplomat , who was at the talks , said : ' our key requirements are : stop , shut and ship			0
' power : the @entity1 president @entity21 ( seated second from right ) leads the country with @entity93 ayatollah @entity92 ( seated second from left ) he was referring to demands for @entity1 to stop producing higher - grade uranium , ship any stockpile out of the country and close down an underground enrichment facility , @entity99			2
but an @entity1 official said @entity7 's delegation had made detailed proposals on the first day of talks and the six powers had responded with one - line answers that lacked any depth			1
he said : ' our feeling is that the agenda this group is following is not suitable for the arguments that @entity1 was making			0
we believe we are at a crossroads			0
and today the other side has to choose a path			0
' deputy foreign minister @entity115 , who leads @entity48 's delegation at the talks , said diplomacy could still be salvaged			2
@entity115 said : ' i do n't think anything will break down			0
we will have a reasonable outcome			0
' ambition : the @entity125 nuclear power plant , just outside the southern city of @entity125 , @entity1 is feared to be among possible @entity35 military targets if negotiations over @entity1 uranium enrichment fail to reach agreement ( picture from 2010 ) production : a picture taken inside the @entity48 built nuclear power plant in @entity125 south of @entity7 in 2009 when journalists were allowed to tour the facility the @entity17 talks follow two rounds of negotiations since diplomacy resumed in april after a 15 - month hiatus			1
during the break in talks the @entity143 cranked up sanctions pressure and @entity35 repeated its threat to bomb @entity1 nuclear sites if diplomacy failed			2
a second @entity77 diplomat said : ' we have n't reached an agreement , but it is more complex than that			0
we have n't got to the end of the conversation			0
' a series of @entity160 resolutions since 2006 have demanded @entity1 suspend all its enrichment - related activities			0
@entity7 denies planning to build nuclear weapons and says its programme is purely for civilian purposes			0
rather than halt enrichment - a process which refines uranium for use as fuel or , if done to a much higher level , nuclear bomb material - @entity1 has increased its activities			2
experts said a breakthrough was unlikely as the six powers involved are wary of making concessions that would let @entity7 draw out the talks and gain the time needed to develop nuclear weapons			2
unity : @entity47 president @entity181 ( right ) and @entity48 president @entity182 ( left ) yesterday at the @entity183 in @entity184 have both called on @entity7 to prove its nuclear programme is not aimed at developing weapons an @entity59 embargo on @entity1 oil takes full effect on july 1 and new @entity47 financial sanctions shortly before that			1
@entity1 's crude oil exports have fallen by some 40 percent this year , according to the @entity194			0
increasing the pressure , is @entity35 - believed to be the only nuclear - armed country in the @entity14 - has said time is running out before @entity1 's nuclear facilities , some of which are deep underground , become invulnerable to air strikes			0
@entity77 diplomats said one positive sign to emerge from monday 's talks was that @entity7 was willing to discuss higher - grade uranium , the international community 's most pressing concern			1
in early 2010 , @entity1 announced it had started enriching uranium to 20 percent purity , a level much higher than what is needed for power generation and seen by some experts as a dangerous step towards being able to make bomb material			1
the six powers want a substantive response to their offer of fuel supplies for @entity7 's research reactor and relief in sanctions on the sale of commercial aircraft parts to @entity1			1
diplomats said the powers had also suggested , at a meeting in @entity228 in may , that they suspend introducing new sanctions at the @entity72 level while diplomacy is taking place , but only if their demands on high - grade uranium are met			2
displaying unity after meeting on the sidelines of a @entity183 summit in @entity184 on monday , @entity48 president @entity182 and @entity47 president @entity181 again called for @entity7 to prove its nuclear programme is not aimed at developing weapons			1
@entity181 said the two leaders agreed on the need for a diplomatic solution to the standoff and that there was still time to resolve the matter through diplomatic means .			0

second and final day of talks between six world powers and the @entity1 fail to reach any new agreements
@entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 and @entity47 want @entity7 to stop enriching uranium
but @entity1 diplomats are claiming ' opposite side is not ready to reach a resolution '
