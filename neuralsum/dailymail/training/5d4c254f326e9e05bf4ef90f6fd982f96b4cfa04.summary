by @entity0 an outspoken , conservative @entity2 congressman from @entity3 , was letting his own staff and volunteers work and even sleep on the floor in filthy , disgusting conditions , whilst he campaigned for re-election			1
the campaign headquarters of @entity2 and @entity11 candidate @entity10 were shut down after they were deemed ' unsafe for habitation			1
' @entity14 filed a request to see the photos of the condemned building , and managed to obtain pictures showing what looks like the decaying debris and detritus of a dilapidated dorm room			0
toilet training required : pictures have been released that show the disgusting conditions volunteers working for outspoken @entity3 @entity26 @entity10 , were working in hell - hole : incredibly , between six and eight staffers and volunteers were sleeping here each night - even though there was no proper bedding or fire safety precautions the photos show exposed electrical outlets , furniture that is literally falling apart and levels of hygiene that leave much to be desired , together with a filthy @entity38			2
the place looks as though it is falling apart at the seams , and yet @entity10 's campaign staffers were spending the night in the building that was a former motorcycle shop			1
the place is about as far away from a ' political campaign office , ' as can be imagined			0
it 's hard to know where workers would have conducted strategy meetings , let alone plugged in laptops safely or even had the desire to cook from the greasy grill			2
controversy : @entity10 is no stranger to drama having already this year attempted to give away a rifle to subscribers to his online mailing list and suggested that unborn babies should be given handguns things got so bad the fire marshal and city building officials in @entity64 , @entity3 ended up ordering the emergency closure of the unorthodox campaign headquarters			1
despite the commercial building was considered ' unsafe for human habitation ' , according to @entity64 city records , between six and eight staffers continued to work and sleep there			1
inspectors found bunk beds had been added in the commercial building , but there were no smoke detectors or fire extinguishers			0
among the fire code violations were faulty or spliced wiring and other electrical hazards , including no illuminated exit signs , improper exit doors and combustible material - mainly @entity10 's campaign signs , according to the @entity85			1
furthermore , no one had obtained the necessary permit for the campaign to legally occupy the pale yellow two - story metal building			2
some hq ! the campaign was ran out of a rusty old motorcycle shop based at the end of a junkyard that was falling apart both inside and outside			1
despite not paying any rent on the building the campaign is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt right wing : congressman @entity10 sells himself as the most conservative member of @entity101 , though he has not been ranked as such @entity10 represents a district of southeast @entity3 that was created as a result of the 2010 census , so he is the first to serve as its representative			1
he previously served as a congressman from 1995 to 1997			0
while his local staff is focusing on re-election efforts , his campaign is also digging itself further into debt			2
according to its latest report , @entity10 's campaign committee has only $ 32,000 and debts of $ 163,000 , including funds owed to the congressman himself			1
at the time of his re-election in 2012 , @entity10 praised his campaign workers and mentioned that some had even slept on the mucky floor			1
' i could not have done it without all the hard - working , grass - roots volunteers			0
believe me , we had them - young conservatives who came into an old motorcycle shop , worked the precincts and made phone calls , slept on the floor , and ate microwaved - meals			1
there 's nothing like volunteers who believe in a candidate and a cause			0
' campaign finance reports show that the @entity10 campaign bought ' bedding for overnight volunteers ' in february 2012 at @entity141			2
the campaign also bought air conditioning equipment and $ 812 in ' remodeling supplies ' for its campaign headquarters that year			0
' if babies had guns they would n't be aborted ' : congressman @entity10 's bumper sticker prompted immediate outrage			1
he was selling them to raise money for a campaign that is heavily in debt the congressman is no stranger to controversy			0
earlier this year he boasted on @entity157 that he is ' the most conservative congressman in @entity3 , ' and offered to give an ar - 15 rifle to someone who joined his online mailing list			0
the @entity10 campaign also sparked outrage in april with a bumper sticker reading ' if babies had guns they would n't be aborted			2
vote pro-life ! the slogan was deemed ' outrageous ' by the masses on @entity157			0
the statement was obviously intended to prompt outrage from critics and serve as a rallying cry from supporters , but a day after posting it to his @entity157 feed , it apparently helped fund his campaign war chest for his 2014 re-election bid			0
he may now be questioning the value of such shock tactics given that his campaign is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt .			0

campaign was run out of *disused* motorcycle shop that allowed free use of the building
up to eight workers slept on the floor in conditions ' unfit for human habitation '
@entity10 's campaign is more than $ *160,000* in debt
