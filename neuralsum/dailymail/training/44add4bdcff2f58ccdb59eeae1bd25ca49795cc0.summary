out - of - favour @entity1 defender @entity0 hopes his role in @entity4 's record breaking start to @entity5 qualifying will provide him with a ' shop window ' for his talents			1
the 34 - year - old is a fan favourite at @entity11 , as well as a two - time player of the year , but has not managed to win over current @entity1 boss @entity13			1
@entity0 has yet to play in the @entity14 this season , with the preferred pairing of @entity17 and @entity18 restricting him to just three @entity20 outings			1
' coming away with @entity4 is always good and playing for the international team is also a shop window , either to impress my club manager or , if things do n't work out , for another club in the future , ' he said			1
' i will give my best for @entity4 and when i get back to @entity1 i will do exactly the same and hopefully things will change for me			1
@entity0 played 32 times in the @entity14 last season but has not made a single appearance in 2014 - 15 ' my club situation has not been ideal this season but i 've been in the game long enough to know things can change very quickly			2
' i picked up an injury in pre-season and then missed the start of the season and lost my place in the team			0
' that 's the first time that has happened to me in my career but i 'm experienced enough to know how to deal with it			0
i 've been working hard to try to get my place back and have been doing a lot of extra training			0
' i have experienced highs and lows in my career and do n't get carried away either way			0
' @entity32 did not hesitate in offering his defensive rock the armband when @entity37 lost his battle with a hamstring injury			0
@entity32 's side are currently top of their @entity77 qualifying group @entity0 had turned down the opportunity to lead the team out in @entity80 last month on the occasion of his 50th cap , instead preferring @entity37 to continue following wins over @entity84 and the @entity24			2
it was a decision that simply reaffirmed @entity32 's respect for the player			0
' i think @entity0 made a very unselfish act in turning down the captaincy on his 50th cap in @entity80 , ' said @entity32			2
' normally a player who reaches that milestone would captain the side but @entity0 did n't want to upset the momentum we had so he passed over that opportunity			2
' he has natural leadership qualities and the respect of every member of the squad			0
' returning @entity23 manager @entity101 , back for a third stint in charge , labelled @entity4 ' the surprise team of the competition ' and the game ' our most important of the year ' .			1

@entity0 is yet to play for @entity1 in the league this season
defender said playing for @entity4 has been his season *highlight*
