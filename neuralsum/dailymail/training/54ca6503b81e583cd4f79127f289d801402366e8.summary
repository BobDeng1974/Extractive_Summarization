the countdown has begun for the @entity3 spacecraft ’s test flight from @entity4 , @entity5 on 4 december			1
@entity7 ’s latest capsule , which will take astronauts on deep space missions , now has its rocket in position and is undergoing final checks			0
@entity7 ’s latest capsule ( artist 's impression pictured ) , which will take astronauts on deep space missions , now has its rocket in position and is undergoing final checks in a 4.5 - hour mission , @entity7 will use a @entity29 heavy rocket to launch the craft 100 miles ( 160km ) above the @entity19 's surface			1
@entity33 stage rockets will then take it 3,600 miles ( 5,793km ) out into space - just far enough to pass through the @entity36 radiation belts			1
the @entity36 radiation belts are two concentric rings encircling the @entity19 and held in place by a magnetic field			1
since the @entity36 belts were first discovered in 1958 , astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration			0
the @entity45 rocket that will launch the test flight has been already put in place on the launch pad , and the @entity3 capsule will be transported there around 10 november			2
in this image , a @entity51 crew prepares to move a @entity29 heavy rocket to the launch pad at @entity4 in a 4.5 - hour mission , @entity7 will use a @entity29 heavy rocket ( illustrated ) to launch the craft 100 miles ( 160km ) above the @entity19 's surface			1
@entity33 stage rockets will then take it 3,600 miles ( 5,793km ) out into space - just far enough to pass through the @entity36 radiation belts the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity3			1
after the @entity3 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object			0
once the @entity3 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			0
after the mission is complete , @entity3 returns to @entity19 on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean - likely the @entity84 days later			0
the mission is seen as an important step towards sending humans to @entity87			0
the acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belts the @entity3 capsule has been outfitted with sensors to take new readings on the belt and ensure that it does n't interfere with any of the capsule 's onboard electronics			2
@entity3 will re-enter @entity19 ’s atmosphere at almost 20,000mph ( 32,180 km / h ) , and reach temperatures near 2,200 ° @entity104 )			0
at this stage , its parachute system will deploy to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the @entity109			0
the @entity45 rocket that will launch the test flight has been already put in place on the launch pad , and the @entity3 capsule will be transported there onaround november 10			2
this @entity29 system is designed to protect astronauts if a problem arises during launch by pulling the spacecraft away from the failing rocket			2
during the december flight , the jettison motor , which separates the launch abort system from the crew module in both normal operations and emergency , will be tested			2
for @entity3 's dry run , the @entity128 - built capsule will have chunks of aluminium in place of seats for ballast , and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays			0
during the december flight , the jettison motor , which separates the launch abort system from the crew module in both normal operations and emergency , will be tested ( illustrated ) the @entity36 radiation belts ( illustrated ) are two concentric rings encircling the @entity19 and held in place by a magnetic field			1
since the @entity36 belts were first discovered in 1958 , astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration @entity3 will re-enter @entity19 ’s atmosphere at almost 20,000mph ( 32,180 km / h ) , and reach temperatures near @entity151 ( illustrated ) once the launch abort system is stacked on the completed crew and service modules , and the three systems are tested together , the @entity3 spacecraft will be considered complete			1
it will then wait inside the launch abort system facility until mid-november , when the @entity45 rocket is ready for integration with the spacecraft			0
@entity3 has its roots in the @entity163 shuttle era ; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low @entity19 orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the @entity169 project			0
on future missions , @entity3 will carry astronauts farther into the solar system than ever before , including to an asteroid , and @entity87			1
this image , taken earlier this month , shows a @entity29 heavy rocket being lifted into the @entity176 at the @entity177 in @entity4 , @entity5			1

the 4 december flight will take place from @entity4 in @entity5
a @entity29 heavy rocket will launch craft 100 miles ( 160km ) above @entity19
upper stage rockets will then take it 3,600 miles ( 5,793km ) out into space
this is just enough to pass through the @entity36 radiation belts - two rings encircling the @entity19 and held in place by a magnetic field
orion capsule has been outfitted with sensors to take readings of belts
on future missions , @entity3 will carry astronauts farther into the solar system than ever before , including to an asteroid and @entity87
