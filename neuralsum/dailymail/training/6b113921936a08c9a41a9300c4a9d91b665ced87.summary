coping with a fear of flying might require counselling , therapy or even just getting aboard and gritting your teeth until you ’re back on terra firma			2
but pop down to a rather unremarkable industrial estate in @entity8 and you might be able to conquer your terrors for good			0
at least that ’s what former pilot @entity13 , 56 , says			1
he has recreated the interior of a @entity15 737 - 800 in one of the estate ’s units to help fearful flyers			1
prepare for take off : pilot @entity13 has created a replica @entity15 - 800 to help people with flying phobias the high - tech simulator is located in an industrial unit near @entity25 in @entity8 there ’s a fully equipped cockpit and , behind it , a cabin with the familiar small windows , overhead lockers and seats with little leg room			1
the simulator also features announcements from the ‘ crew ’ and the sounds that terrify nervous flyers			1
mr @entity13 , who took redundancy after 20 years with @entity39 , counsels clients and discusses the flying process with them			1
clients then use the simulator to ‘ fly ’ the plane themselves			1
since launching the @entity44 in @entity45 , he has already helped eight clients beat their fears			0
he said : ‘ people have left saying that instead of feeling nervous about a flight they were excited			0
’ mr @entity13 also offers pilot training , educational trips and corporate events at the unit			2
it costs £ 100 per hour for a three - hour @entity56 session			0
