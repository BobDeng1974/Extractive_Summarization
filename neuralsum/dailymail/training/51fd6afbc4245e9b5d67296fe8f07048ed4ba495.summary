' terrifying ' : anti-rape campaigners have slammed an article posted online which instructs men to map out ' red lines ' for potential wives the write defended the section titled ' you do n't reject me , ever ' as attempting to have ' humour value ' and ' offer advice ' the article , written by a former @entity34 columnist posting under the pseudonym @entity36 , is a list of five rules the writer says men must impose in a relationship to ensure it succeeds			1
among its guidelines is ' you do n't reject me , ever ' - instructing men never to allow prospective partners to refuse them sex			1
' under no circumstance can you accept the idea that she gets to choose if or when to satisfy you or choose to sabotage your joint fertility , ' it reads			0
' only give sex when it suits you			1
you control the time and frequency of sex , not her			2
' the obvious exception to this is the first time you have sex			2
typically she will control the timing of that for obvious reasons			0
' from the second time onward , any poorly - reasoned denial is a red flag			0
' the article has been slammed as ' terrifying ' and ' misogynistic ' by campaigners shocked that such attitudes exist in modern society '			1
@entity73 , who waived her anonymity after seeing her stepfather jailed for assaulting her to campaign on behalf of rape victims , said the article ' clearly ' condoned rape			2
' saying something is all part of the thought process			0
the fact they believe this shows they can act on it			0

' the views expressed throughout are not only deeply outdated but also profoundly misogynistic			0
' the writer unapologetically , aggressively and repeatedly advises men to enslave and dehumanise women			1
' he is incredibly misguided and cynical in his apparent view that only a relationship or marriage based on power , control and abuse can ever endure			0
' most seriously and alarmingly of all , however , the first on the writer ’s list of ‘ rules ’ amounts to an incitement to rape			0
' someone who " refuses to take no for an answer " from their partner and has sex with her or him anyway is a rapist			0
' the writer , who declined to give his real name , defended the article , saying : '' the post aims to have some humor value but also include useful advice			1
' it was only my second blog post and i may or may not have achieved that aim			0
' if you read the post carefully you will see that it does n't say that a woman should be forced to comply			1
' it merely says that a man should choose not to marry a woman who displays certain behaviors			0
' the post did not incite , condone or so much as discuss rape , even in jest			0
' almost 700 comments have been posted beneath the article on the website , the majority of which written by internet users claiming to be men and in support of @entity163 's views			1
the website , which describes itself as ' a small but vocal collection of men in @entity10 today who believe men should be masculine and women should be feminine ' has been criticised in the past for controversial content			1
