such a designation would again likely increase the length of any prison sentence			0
@entity61 also noted that the government could have claimed that the crime endangered the financial health of @entity3 , a designation that also could increase a prison sentence			0
a prosecutor said he did not believe either enhancement was appropriate because @entity8 carried out the fraud in a manner similar to his usual work patterns and the company 's financial stability was not threatened			2
' the court 's puzzled by the lack of any enhancements in this case with the loss of $ 118 million , ' @entity61 said			1
