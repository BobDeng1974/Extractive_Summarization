a chilling image has surfaced which claims to show the ghost of a young drowning victim			1
the spine - tingling photograph was posted on @entity4 by @entity6 @entity5 , but things began to get really spooky when it was revealed that a little girl died in the same spot 100 years ago			1
ms @entity5 , from @entity11 , posted the image , which was taken in 2014 , on the ' @entity13 ' facebook page			1
it appears to show two women and four children swimming			1
however ms @entity5 and @entity17 , the other adult in the photo , are adamant they were with only three children when the photo was taken at @entity23 in @entity24 , south - east @entity11			1
the face that can be seen appears to be very white with dark eyes and two shapes on either side of its head			0
' at the time of taking this photo there was nothing between us , ' ms @entity5 insists			2
' i 'm holding the little girl and that white head next to me with horns is not human , i can promise you that , ' ms @entity5 said			1
' its fingers are on my shoulder and on my daughter 's arm			2
they are long skeletal type fingers			0
' the story became even spookier when researchers uncovered the story of @entity33 , a 13 - year - old girl who drowned in the same creek in 1913			1
on the @entity4 page , some commenters called these shapes ' horns ' , whilst others claimed to see two buns or two pony tails			2
a @entity78 newspaper clipping from november 22 1913 has a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole			2
' @entity85 , aged 13 years , eldest daughter of mr. @entity84 was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the @entity86 on friday afternoon , ' the notice reads			1
' nearly an hour elapsed , before the body was recovered			0
the spot , which has always been considered dangerous , is known as @entity89 , and is over 20 foot deep			0
an admin from the @entity91 posted a negative version of the image , saying : ' light flare will always show up as black shadowing when the photo is inverted			0
. and in this case the light flare is coming from full sunlight reflecting off the water onto the child ' tragic @entity33 was only 13 when she accidentally drowned in the swimming hole in 1915 ' the funeral took place on saturday afternoon and was largely attended			1
the convent school children dressed in white , marching next to the hearse			0
' disturbingly , ms @entity5 claims that there had been strange occurrences that day as they swam in the water , which only firms her belief that a spirit was present			1
' on this day my daughter had her leg grabbed two times by something in the water			2
' ' when i went back in for one last dip to cool off i did feel something behind me as i was walking out of water but tried to ignore it			0
ms @entity5 claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915			1
she is convinced that it @entity33 is ' an entity that exists in that spot in the creek '			2
some people commenting on the @entity4 photo , including ms @entity5 , claim there are multiple spirits captured in the photograph			1
' there is a man with a beard near the girl i 'm holding , near her feet			0
there are about four faces in the water			0
ms @entity5 posted the photo on the @entity4 page the administrators were shocked by the photo , writing ' we used to swim there all the time growing up and all i can say is just to be safe i 'm never swimming there again ! ' ms @entity5 claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915 ms @entity5 was also of the opinion that the figure in the photo was a demon who tried to take her daughter a cynic responded to ms @entity5 's claims , pointing out another possibility			1
' the eye sees what it wants to see			0
in my opinion , it 's nothing more than a splash of water , ' wrote @entity177			0
' notice the child facing away from the camera - their left arm has just surfaced , causing a splash			2
' @entity183 had another explanation : ' i think it is another kid just the sun is over exposed more on the face as they are facing the sun. ' the ' @entity13 ' @entity4 page administrators were not convinced by either explanation			0
' we used to swim there all the time growing up and all i can say is just to be safe i 'm never swimming there again ! ' they wrote			0
