it 's an opportunity for word buffs and maths whizzes to show the world their unrivaled skills			0
but when @entity6 was invited to join the countdown team , the tv personality left the panel of experts lost for words , after submitting a rather rude one from the dictionary corner			1
when presented with a collection of vowels and consonants , the chef suggested ' todgers ' to the amusement of hosts @entity18 and @entity20			1
as it is listed in the @entity30 , it would have counted had it been presented by a competitor and won seven points			2
it is not the first time rude words have been suggested in the @entity24 afternoon programme which began in 1982			1
in february an @entity37 teacher shocked viewers when submitting the word 'm * nges ' , an expletive sometimes used to describe female genitalia			0
in 1991 , two contestants offered ' w * * * ers ' , and in 2010 another suggested 's * * tface '			0
on another occasion contestants resisted the temptation to spell out swear words when presented with the letters @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 tv chef @entity6 offered the word up for seven points from his chair in the dictionary corner with expert @entity26 not the first word to have left @entity20 blushing , the @entity59 star found herself stifling laughter after drawing the words ' p * ss ' and ' a * se ' shortly after replacing @entity67 in 2009			1
during her 26 - year stint , ms @entity67 was left red - faced more than a few times			2
words such as fart , porn and poo are among the collection of letters which had the @entity76 star and her co-hosts falling about laughing			0
among the crude words which presented themselves during @entity67 's 26 - year - stint is ' poo ' another cringe - worthy moment as @entity67 withdraws an unfortunate sequence of letters on the show			0

the tv chef joined the dictionary corner on @entity24 programme
suggested the seven - letter word which is listed in @entity30
hosts @entity18 and @entity20 left amused by rude submission
