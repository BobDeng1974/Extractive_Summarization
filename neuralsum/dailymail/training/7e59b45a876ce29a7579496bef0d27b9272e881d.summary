with their talisman out injured and their captain suspended , @entity0 are in for a tough ride in their semi-final			1
they have been exciting to watch but mainly because they play off the cuff			2
whereas @entity11 are a really solid team , @entity0 sometimes play like a team of mavericks			1
he ’s hardly next in the line of brilliant @entity49 strikers and without @entity17 , the pressure is on him more than ever			1
i wonder if it could be @entity15 ’s time			0
that no 10 role is there for the taking and he or @entity56 have to grab the chance			0
but with the star man missing , this could be a game too far for @entity0			1
@entity60 : @entity62 team - mates @entity56 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) could both fill @entity17 's vacant role @entity64 ready to fill @entity17 's boots @entity66 @entity67 showed tremendous courage to sub on @entity70			1
he is clearly a single - minded manager and thinks outside the box , but part of me was thinking it would be very interesting if it went wrong ! it would not have been a spontaneous decision			2
all week , he and @entity70 would have studied the @entity78 ’ penalties and planned the substitution			1
@entity70 was very hyped up before he came on and wanted to do everything he could to help his team			1
he wo n’t be winning the fair play award any time soon after his gamesmanship and it ’s not what we like to see , but players are not there to be friends			0
@entity90 does n’t win friends with his dives but if the @entity93 win the @entity19 , they wo n’t care			1
i probably would have given @entity70 a few choice words but the whole episode was designed to psyche out the @entity78 and it worked			1
stretch : @entity70 was the hero for @entity98 as they beat @entity100 in a penalty - shootout in @entity102 mastermind : @entity93 manager @entity67 send @entity70 on just for the shootout after @entity105 started jubilation : @entity98 celebrate beating @entity100 and advancing to the semi-finals in @entity0 bring back 3 - 5 - 2 one of the most enjoyable things about this @entity19 has been the number of different tactical systems on show			1
i love how teams have shown there is more than one way to play the game			0
for a long time coaches have turned their noses up at the idea of 3 - 5 - 2 and made it unfashionable but it ’s making a comeback with the @entity93			2
it can give you strength at the back and in midfield but still provide the option of playing two strikers			2
@entity130 and @entity131 both used it with @entity133 and maybe it ’s something we can look at again because of our problems keeping the ball			0
@entity98 have proved it can be effective because if you ’ve got the players , you can make any system work			0
man - mark @entity143 ? @entity144 have been my tip for the @entity19 from day one but i must say i ’m not impressed with how they ’re playing			1
danger man : @entity143 and @entity144 remain on course for a place in the @entity19 final punching above his weight : @entity143 had a physical disadvantage against the likes of @entity153 going deep : @entity144 reached their first @entity19 semi-final since 1990 after beating @entity155 1 - 0 @entity156 : @entity143 @entity143 is the best player i ’ve seen in my lifetime and with goals and assists in @entity0 it ’s difficult to criticise him			1
but it still feels like we ’re not getting the complete @entity143 package			0
when he burst clear late on against @entity155 , he had a couple of looks over his shoulder to see who was chasing him			0
the @entity143 of old would never do that			0
it ’s like he still does n’t trust his body to sprint properly			0
the next tactical question for @entity172 and @entity98 is whether to man - mark @entity143 or leave him			2
with @entity174 out , @entity98 could detail one man to take care of @entity143			0
he ’s an escape artist when he ’s surrounded by players but lacks that explosive pace he once had			0
rodriguez my star @entity181 has been my player of the tournament so far and not just because of his goals			2
i have loved watching him glide across the pitch — he lets the ball run across him so well and always has the bigger picture in his head			0
stage : @entity181 's stunning @entity19 is over after @entity21 were eliminated by @entity0 moment : @entity181 's volley against @entity191 was one of the best goals of the tournament @entity0 kicked lumps out of him in the quarter - final but he kept coming back for more , always the sign of a good player			1
he cost @entity198 a lot of money so it ’s no surprise to see him doing well but , playing in the @entity203 league , he ’s not been as high - profile as some			2
i ’d love to see him in the @entity207 but i suspect @entity208 will want him .			0

@entity0 face @entity11 in @entity19 semi-final in @entity28
@entity17 out for rest of tournament with a back injury
captain @entity26 suspended for last - four *showdown*
@entity11 beat @entity35 1 - 0 at @entity36 in quarter - final clash
@entity67 made a brave call to bring on @entity70 just for the penalty shoot - out against @entity100
@entity144 have reached the semi-finals , but they have *n't* impressed
