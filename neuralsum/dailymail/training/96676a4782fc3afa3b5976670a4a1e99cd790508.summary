‘ @entity10 asked the audience how many children @entity8 had , ’ wrote @entity27 in financial advisor			2
‘ he explained that @entity8 had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina , with whom he likely talked of " poetry " rather than procreated			0
’ @entity27 said many of the audience members took offense at the remark , but that @entity10 continued			2
‘ @entity10 , author of @entity48 and @entity49 , ' wrote @entity27 , ‘ says it 's only logical that @entity8 would take this selfish worldview because he was an " effete " member of society			1
’ cold : @entity10 said the @entity51 economist @entity8 , pictured , had selfish ideas as a result of his sexuality it is worth noting that , though many conservatives use the term ‘ keynesian economics ’ as derogatory , @entity8 was not wholly liberal			2
@entity8 , whose most famous quote is ‘ in the long run we are all dead , ’ once called the market system the ‘ best safeguard of the variety of life ’ that preserved the ‘ most secure and successful choices of former generations			0
’ however , rather than to @entity8 ’ ‘ selfish worldview , ’ @entity27 wrote that @entity10 endeared himself during the q&a to @entity18 ’s ‘ social contract , ’ a term used largely by liberals today			2
married : @entity8 ' wife @entity74 was a ballerina			0

past : @entity10 , a noted historian , was roundly criticized for a 2012 @entity83 story many say misrepresented @entity20 's policies ‘ i should not have suggested , ’ wrote @entity10 , ‘ that @entity8 was indifferent to the long run because he had no children , nor that he had no children because he was gay			1
