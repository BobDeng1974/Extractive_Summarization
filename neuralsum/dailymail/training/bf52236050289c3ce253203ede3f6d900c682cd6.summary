a toddler born with a rare defect has made a miraculous recovery after surgeons were forced to break open her skull and piece it back together like a jigsaw			1
@entity6 was born with craniosynostosis , a condition which causes the skull plates to fuse together in the womb			1
it caused @entity6 to have a twisted head , with one side bulging			1
and as well as causing the deformity , the condition threatened to create fatal pressure on her developing brain			2
@entity6 was born with craniosynostosis , a condition which causes the skull plates to fuse together in the womb			1
it left the newborn with a twisted head , one side bulging and her parents were warned it could cause pressure on her developing brain but after a nine - hour life - saving operation at @entity32 's @entity31 the now two - year - old is back at home with her parents @entity34 and @entity36 , and her sisters @entity37 and @entity39 but , after a nine - hour life - saving operation , which involved a full blood transfusion , @entity6 , now two , is back home with her parents @entity34 and @entity36 , and her sisters @entity37 and @entity39			1
her mother ms @entity34 , 38 , said : ' @entity6 really is our jigsaw baby			1
' the front of her skull was taken off , broken into pieces and then put back together			1
' she was cut from ear to ear across the top of her head - it was really difficult to see			2
' she had a full head - bandage and her eyes were swollen - she was very poorly			2
' we were told at any time it could put pressure on her brain			1
' one doctor was concerned there was not enough room for her brain to grow and it could have ended with us losing her			0
' @entity62 is a rare condition affecting affects one in 2,500 babies			0
it causes babies to develop an irregularly shaped skull			0
it caused @entity6 's head to grow abnormally , and meant she did n't have an eyebrow on one side			1
after the live - saving surgery at @entity73 , she is just like a normal two - year - old , but she may need further surgery on her eye in later life			1

@entity6 has been left with a large ' jigsaw ' scar stretching from ear to ear , right she will have checks on her head for the next 10 years , but her mother ms @entity34 added : ' it will take two years for her head to completely enclose and be like a normal child 's , so we will have to be careful with her ' @entity62 is a rare condition , which causes babies to develop an irregularly shaped skull			1
the abnormal shape of a child 's head can cause persistent headaches , learning difficulties , problems with vision			2
symptoms of craniosynostosis result from increased pressure in the skull , called intracranial pressure			2
the condition causes a baby 's skull to prematurely fuse , leaving it unable to grow in certain areas			2
where one area is fused the skull is prevented from growing			0
it causes other parts of the skull to ' overgrow ' to compensate and limit the pressure devleoping around the brain			2
the lack of growth in some areas , and ' overgrowth ' in others causes the irregular head shape			0
@entity135 synostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis , accounting for around half of all cases			0
it occurs when the suture - the elastic tissues connecting the plates of bone in the skull - at the top of the head fuses			2
it leads to a lack of growth in width and compensatory growth in length , resulting in a long , narrow skull			0
source : @entity156 ms @entity34 , from @entity157 , @entity158 , said : ' @entity6 is incredibly bright and mischievous as you 'd expect a two - year - old to be , but it has been really hard			1
' we always said if it was just for cosmetic reasons we would n't put ourselves through that , but if her condition compromised her future we 'd have to go ahead			0
' it 's been really stressful on all of us , really			0
' it will take two years for her head to completely enclose and be like a normal child 's , so we will have to be careful with her			1
' @entity6 will continue to have checks on her head for the next 10 years , but now she has recovered from her life - changing operation , the family have agreed to speak out to raise awareness of the condition			1
ms @entity34 said she is indebted to @entity176 , a support network of parents who have seen their children go through similar operations , who have a @entity184 page			0
she said : ' i want to show other families going through the same thing there is light at the end of the tunnel , to show what it 's like on the other side			0
' the parents on there have been an absolute godsend			0
' you can go on there and vent any feelings you 've got and there are people there who know exactly how you feel			0
' she said another @entity184 group called @entity207 's @entity206 aimed to raise money for parents whose children need craniosynostosis operations .			0

@entity6 was born with craniosynostosis , which causes the skull plates to fuse together in the womb and can put pressure on the brain
caused the youngster to have a twisted head , with one side bulging
after a nine - hour life - saving operation little @entity6 is now back at home
surgeons broke her skull into pieces before putting it back together
the now two - year - old will have checks for the next 10 years and it will take two years for her head to enclose and be like a normal child her age
