@entity14 , 46 , was held by @entity30 *militants* for six months last year
he says he was guarded by three men who spoke with @entity19 accents
@entity244 *nicknamed* @entity22 because they *regularly* ' beat ' prisoners
@entity0 - later identified as @entity26 - was the gang leader
he would draw on the prisoners heads with a red pen to mark out who he next planned to brutally execute in a filmed beheading
when his pencil was blunt he would scratch a cross into next victim 's head
