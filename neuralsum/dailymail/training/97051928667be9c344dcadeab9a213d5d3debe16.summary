@entity0 contracted @entity1 on a holiday to the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 that left him hospitalised and off work for five weeks			1
the holidaymaker , from @entity9 , @entity10 , is taking legal action against @entity12 after finding out that a fellow holidaymaker died from the disease only a number of weeks later after staying at the same resort			1
mr @entity0 , and his wife @entity17 , 55 , visited the apartments in september 2014 for a two - week stay , along with mr @entity0 's sister and her partner			1
on his return to the @entity23 from a stay at the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity0 was diagnosed with @entity1 and placed on a drip prior to the group flying home , mr @entity0 fell ill , suffering with diarrhoea , a fever , shortness of breath and nausea			1
when he returned to the @entity23 he visited his local gp and the next day he was admitted to hospital , where he was diagnosed with @entity1 and placed on an iv drip			1
he stayed in hospital for five days and was then discharged			2
mr @entity0 was absent from work for five weeks			1
his sister 's partner also suffered an unconfirmed illness whilst staying at the apartments and was prescribed medicine at a clinic in @entity5			2
since returning to the @entity23 , mr @entity0 discovered that @entity44 , from @entity45 , who stayed at the same @entity46 , died in hospital in @entity48 after reportedly contracting @entity1			1
he alleges @entity12 previously claimed that there is no clear link between the illness that caused ms @entity44 's death and water contamination at the @entity55 apartments			1
however , the apartments were closed some days after ms @entity44 tested positive for @entity56			2
mr @entity0 and his wife say that they were originally told by @entity12 that his illness was an isolated case and that they would not be investigating the cause further			1
last year the @entity63 were forced to relocate guests following an outbreak of @entity1 ' however since his illness and the death of ms @entity44 , guests due to stay at the apartments have been relocated to alternative accommodation			1
mr @entity0 said : ' the whole experience was extremely scary for myself , my wife and my children , as well as my grandchildren , as my symptoms quickly got worse when i got home and i ended up on oxygen and a drip in hospital			1
it 's the last thing which you expect when you go on holiday			0
' it was frightening to find out that another holidaymaker at @entity86 had died after contracting the same illness that i had suffered			0
' i was very frustrated that the tour operator told me my illness was an isolated case and that they would not be investigating further			0
i was extremely concerned that other people staying at the resort would not be aware of the issues			2
mr @entity0 travelled to @entity5 with his wife @entity17 , but his holiday took a turn for the worse when he fell violently ill ' during our stay we noticed algae in the swimming pool and we felt the pool did n't appear to be cleaned correctly			1
there was also a problem with the water in the apartment as the shower would run hot and cold			0
' i am very lucky that i received the correct diagnosis and treatment so quickly , but i was still forced to take time off work			0
' hopefully , my legal team 's investigations will lead to answers about why i contracted @entity1 and help to ensure others do not have to go through the same experience i have endured			2
' a spokesperson for @entity12 has told @entity118 that the company is ' sorry ' to hear that mr @entity0 contracted the illness			1
' we believed there was a heightened risk of water contamination towards the end of october and , as a precaution , @entity12 arranged alternative accommodation for all guests who were either staying in or due to travel to the hotel until the end of the season , ' the spokesperson said			2
the @entity63 in @entity132 was staying with his wife and family ' @entity12 also contacted all customers who stayed at the apartments in october to check if they felt unwell			1
as this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further			0
' @entity12 closely audits all of the hotels to which we operate to ensure they meet our high health and safety standards			0
we would like to reassure customers that situations such as this are extremely rare			0
' @entity145 , an expert international personal injury lawyer at @entity147 , who is representing a number of holidaymakers who suffered from the outbreak said : ' @entity1 is a very serious illness and can be fatal in some cases due to the respiratory complications it can cause			0
' the immediate priorities now are ensuring anyone affected receives the help and support they need as well as identifying the cause of the illness as soon as possible			0
' we have acted in several previous outbreaks of @entity1			0
our work on behalf of victims of fatal outbreaks at the @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity48 where sadly four victims died with many others left fighting for their lives , as well as closer to home in both @entity173 and @entity174 in recent years , means we have seen first - hand the devastating impact @entity1 can have on victims			2
' the seriousness of such illnesses can not be underestimated and it is vital that public health authorities in @entity48 , and the hotel management work to quickly to locate the source of these problems and provide holidaymakers with the answers they deserve			0
' we shall be working closely with our @entity48 colleagues to investigate this outbreak and establish the level of investigations that have to date been made by the @entity48 authorities			0
on the basis of the information we have at the moment , any legal proceedings would be pursued in @entity195			0
' as we conduct our investigations we ask anyone who has stayed at the @entity46 and may be able to help provide information about the conditions , to get in contact with us as they may be able to help with the case			0
