newly elected @entity1 gov. @entity0 imposed a moratorium on the death penalty in the state friday , calling the current system of capital punishment ' error prone , expensive and anything but infallible			1
' @entity0 said the suspension will remain in effect at least until he receives a report from a legislative commission that has been studying the topic for about four years			1
' if we are to continue to administer the death penalty , we just take further steps to ensure that defendants have appropriate counsel at every stage of their prosecution , that the sentence is applied fairly and proportionally , and that we eliminate the risk of executing an innocent , ' @entity0 said in a memorandum announcing the policy			1
newly minted @entity1 gov. @entity0 imposed a moratorium on the death penalty in his state friday , 13 , calling the current system of capital punishment ' error - prone , expensive and anything but infallible ' @entity0 said he is granting a temporary reprieve to @entity31 , scheduled for execution march 4 for killing two men			1
@entity31 was convicted of first - degree murder after beating to death in 1984 a man at a cemetery with a tire iron			0
for that killing he was sentenced to death			0
he was separately convinced of third - degree murder for stabbing to death a @entity44 man earlier that year at the age of 17			0
he admitted to killing them both while in his teens but now says the men had been sexually abusing him			0
@entity1 's death row , which has been shrinking , houses 183 men and three women , but the state has executed only three people since the @entity56 @entity55 restored the death penalty in 1976			1
all three had voluntarily given up their appeals			0
the most recent execution was @entity60 in 1999 , convicted of killing two women he had imprisoned in his @entity44 home			0
the governor pointed out on friday that six people on death row in his state had been exonerated since 1978 and that 150 people nationwide haves since been proven innocent			1
@entity0 said data suggests that defendants might be more likely to be charged with capital murder and sentenced to death if they are poor or a racial minority and the victim is white			2
' if the commonwealth of @entity1 is going to take the irrevocable step of executing a human being , its capital sentencing system must be infallible , ' @entity0 wrote			2
' @entity1 's system is riddled with flaws , making it error prone , expensive and anything but infallible			0

@entity31 , who could have become the first person since 1999 to be executed in the state , is getting a reprieve from @entity0 the reasons for the state 's lack of executions have long been debated in @entity1 legal circles			1
some have attributed it to death penalty opposition among judges on the 3rd @entity56 @entity107 or to aggressive tactics by lawyers who defend people facing execution			1
others say the number of stayed or overturned death sentences demonstrates there are flaws in how those cases are handled , particularly when it comes to providing adequate representation at trial			0
@entity0 , a @entity121 , had promised a death penalty moratorium during his fall campaign against his predecessor , @entity124 gov. @entity124			1
the @entity1 @entity125 said @entity0 had no authority to impose the moratorium , calling it a misuse of the concept of a reprieve			1
' he has rejected the decisions of juries that wrestled with the facts and the law before unanimously imposing the death penalty , disregarded a long line of decisions made by @entity1 and federal judges , ignored the will of the @entity142 , and ultimately turned his back on the silenced victims of cold - blooded killers , ' the association said in a written statement			2
an association spokeswoman said legal action in response was likely , and possible options were already being discussed at a meeting friday of the group 's executive committee in @entity154			0
the head of the @entity156 called the decision a sad day for the state and noted that @entity159 , accused of killing state trooper cpl. @entity160 in the @entity161 last year , would have faced a potential death sentence if convicted			0
' gov. @entity0 's decision today is a travesty because it prevents the commonwealth and the family of cpl. @entity160 from securing the penalty that is deserved			2
this decision also will affect the families of victims from all across the state who have had their loved ones torn from them due to senseless acts of violence from dangerous criminals , ' said the group 's president , @entity177 .			0
