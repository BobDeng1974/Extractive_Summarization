the @entity2 chief received a grilling by respected reporters on @entity9 and @entity10 's today programme			1
during the two interviews mr @entity1 , forced to resign for ' shoddy journalism ' yesterday , revealed his lack of awareness of the @entity17 programme in which @entity18 was wrongly accused of being involved in a child abuse scandal			1
in a tense 15 - minute interview with veteran presenter @entity22 on @entity2 ’s flagship @entity35 news programme , mr @entity1 was told by @entity22 : ' you should go , should n't you ? ' he also admitted he only saw the @entity17 programme the day after it was aired , saying : ' i was out '			1
in a second nine - minute interview with @entity40 and @entity41 on @entity9 , he stumbled his way through a series of damning questions			2
when asked : ' when did you know as director - general of the @entity2 that @entity18 was the figure they were investigating ? ' mr @entity1 is grilled by @entity40 and @entity41 on @entity9 yesterday at one point during the humiliating interview , pictured , @entity41 said : ' many people will find it extraordinary that in your position and given what has already happened that you were n't alerted ? he replied , whilst stumbling and repeating his words : ' i did n't find that out , to be frankly i did n't find that out until it became clear from twitter comments and from newspaper coverage during this last week			1
i did not know in advance that he was in any sense involved in that @entity17 investigation but i had not had that news investigation brought to my attention prior to transmission			0
' at one point during the humiliating interview @entity41 said : ' many people will find it extraordinary that in your position and given what has already happened that you were n't alerted ? ' now that seems like the most extraordinary thing that you , if you like members of the public are finding things out for yourself sat at home while you are looking at the internet , that is an extraordinary situation ? ' he admitted the @entity17 report which led to the @entity27 peer being implicated in child sexual abuse should not have been broadcast , saying : ' it was our responsibility and @entity17 ’s responsibility to make sure that and misidentification did not end up on @entity92			0
' we did not manage to do that and therefore we have to take the blame for that , no question '			0
i quit : @entity1 , left , makes his resignation statement last night with @entity99 chairman @entity98 and in one key exchange on the @entity10 's today programme , mr @entity22 asked : ' when did you know that this film was being broadcast and when was it drawn to your attention that it was going to make extraordinarily serious allegations about a man whose identity would inevitably be uncovered - wrongly , as we now know ? ' @entity1 replied : ' the film was not drawn to my attention before transmission			1
' it was all too much for him and mr @entity1 ’s stint as director - general was over , having lasted less than two months			1
mr @entity1 , 50 , took over as director general from @entity117 on september 17 on a much - reduced salary of £ 450,000			2
meanwhile , the chairman of the @entity120 today vowed to fight on to restore confidence in the corporation in the wake of the crisis			0
@entity98 said mr @entity1 - who dramatically resigned last night - had been ' destroyed ' by the botched @entity17 investigation which wrongly implicated a senior former @entity27 in a child abuse scandal			1
@entity99 chairman @entity98 , right , told @entity128 's @entity127 that mr @entity1 had been ' destroyed ' by the botched @entity17 investigation however he made clear that he would resist calls to follow suit , insisting his job was to ensure the @entity2 learned the lessons from what happened and from the inquiries under way into the @entity137 child abuse scandal			1
he told @entity128 ’s the @entity127 : ' i think that i now have to make sure that , in the interests of the licence fee payer and the audience , that the @entity2 has a grip , that we get ourselves back onto the road			0
' i think that my job is to make sure that we learn the lessons of those inquiries and that we restore confidence and trust in the @entity2			0
if i do n’t do that then i am sure that people will let me know			0
' video : @entity22 grills outgoing director - general on @entity10 today outgoing @entity2 director - general @entity1 was yesterday involved in an extraordinary exchange with veteran presenter @entity22 on @entity2 ’s flagship radio 4 today news programme			1
here are excerpts from the transcript : @entity158 : but you must have known what happened because a tweet was put out 24 hours beforehand telling the world that something was going to happen on @entity17 that night that would reveal extraordinary things about child abuse and that would involve a senior @entity27 figure from the @entity167 years			0
you did n’t see that tweet ? @entity168 : i did n’t see that tweet , @entity171 , i now understand ... @entity158 : why not ? @entity168 : well i , uh , i check @entity30 sometimes at the end of the day or i do n’t check it at @entity173 : you have an enormous staff of people who are reporting in to you on all sorts of things – they did n’t see this tweet that was going to set the world on fire ? @entity168 : now @entity171 , this tweet , i ’m afraid , was not brought to my attention , so i found out about this film after it had gone out ... @entity158 : nobody said to you at any time or to anybody on your staff who would then report to you , “ look , we ’ve got this @entity17 film going out – @entity17 should already light a few bulbs with you surely but – we ’ve got this film going out that is going to make massively serious allegations about a former senior political ... ” nobody even mentioned it ? @entity168 : no. jh : is n’t that extraordinary ? @entity168 : well , um , in the light of what happened here , i wish this had been referred to me , but it was n’t and i have to ... i run the @entity2 on the basis that the right people are put in the right positions to make the right decisions			2
now , in this case the film was not signed off in @entity17 , legal advice was involved , it was referred to the right places in news management and further referral upwards was made ... @entity158 : so , when did you find out ? @entity168 : i found out about the film the following day			0
@entity158 : the following day ? you did n’t see it that night when it was broadcast ? @entity168 : no , i was out ... @entity158 : but you have seen the film now i take it ? @entity168 : yes , i have seen the film now ... @entity158 : when did you learn that there were doubts about [ mr @entity222 ’s ] testimony ? @entity168 : i only found out yesterday when i saw him make his apology to @entity18 that there must be doubts about his testimony			2
@entity158 : and you did n’t ask any questions during the course of the week ? because questions began to be raised very early on in the week as you know			0
@entity168 : no , @entity171 , i didn’t.jh : do you not think that you should have ? @entity168 : i um.			0
. there are ... the number of things that there are going on in the @entity2 mean that when something is referred to me and brought to my attention i engage with it ... @entity158 : we now know @entity17 has failed massively on one programme and it has failed massively on another programme and it ’s caused the @entity2 enormous damage			2
you , as you say , as editor - in - chief , are ultimately responsible			0
therefore it leads to the obvious question : you should go , should n’t you ? @entity168 : no @entity171 , i ’ve been appointed the director - general , the director - general is n’t appointed only if things are going to go well , the director - general is appointed to deal with things which go well and things which go badly ... @entity158 : have you given any thought to shutting down @entity17 ? @entity168 : no , i have n’t @entity171 ... video : @entity253 stumbles while being questioned on @entity9			1
