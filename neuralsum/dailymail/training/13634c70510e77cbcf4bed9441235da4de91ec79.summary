by @entity0 for @entity1 some scientists believe alien life was transported to @entity4 on a comet - a theory known as panspermia			1
but if alien life can travel between planets , the opposite may also be true , and parts of @entity4 could be ' seeding ' life elsewhere in the solar system			1
the theory has gained traction over the past few years , with scientists claiming that the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs took @entity4 - life to @entity19 and the moons of @entity21			1
some scientists believe alien life was transported to @entity4 on a comet			1
but if alien life can travel between planets , the opposite may also be true , and @entity4 could be ' seeding ' life elsewhere in the solar system in a paper last year , @entity28 , a phd candidate at @entity29 said that it 's likely that life from @entity4 has already been brought to other planet			1
ms @entity28 's team first looked at the number of rocks bigger than 9.8ft ( 3 metres ) that were thrown out to space from @entity4 by major impacts , according to a report by @entity39 in @entity40			1
the size of rock would shield microbes from the sun 's radiation over a journey across the solar system			0
using computer simulations , the team then mapped the fate of these rocks			0
while many did n't survive the journey , thousands of rocks hit @entity19 and about six rocks made it as far as @entity55 , a moon of @entity21 with an icy crust			1
in a paper last year , @entity28 , a phd candidate at @entity29 said that it 's likely that life from @entity4 has already been brought to other planet , such as @entity19 ( pictured ) ' at the end of the day , it 's not the numbers themselves that matter , but the order of magnitude , ' ms @entity28 told @entity40			1
building blocks of life can spring into existence spontaneously when icy comets smash into planets , a study has shown			0
a similar process can create amino acids - bits of proteins - when a rocky meteorite strikes an ice - covered world			0
how often the building blocks end up constructing proteins and living organisms is an unanswered question			0
but the research last year helped fill in another piece of the puzzle of life 's origins on @entity89 believe that about the time life first emerged , between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years ago , @entity4 was being bombarded by comets and meteorites			1
‘ our work shows that the basic building blocks of life can be assembled anywhere in the @entity100 and perhaps beyond , ’ said dr @entity93 , from @entity94			0
‘ however , the catch is that these building blocks need the right conditions in order for life to flourish			0
’ ' if the numbers were much lower than one , we 'd assume this event is unlikely to have occurred since the origin of life on @entity4			2
' but one to ten impacts over the last several billion years tells us we ca n't rule out the possibility of life from @entity4 seeding an outer solar system moon			2
' the theory has let some scientists to imagine a future in which humans could colonise space by sending dna to distant planets and ' printing ' a new civilisation			1
in a talk at the @entity129 's ' the future is @entity130 ' in @entity131 in may , @entity126 engineer @entity125 spoke about the future of space exploration			0
and aside from reiterating the importance that we continue manned exploration , he spoke of a lesser - known method of space exploration – sending the human genome to far - flung planets			2
the idea was first dreamed up by @entity143 biologists dr @entity144 and dr @entity145 , as reported in a @entity147 release			0
how these bacteria would grow into humans is up for debate			0
they could simply be left to evolve , as life did on @entity4 , seeding another planet with our own organisms			2
alternatively , an autonomous machine capable of creating cellular life could be sent thousands of years in advance to a habitable exoplanet outside the solar system			0
upon arrival , information on how to genetically construct a human would be beamed to the machine			0
of course , these proposals are something that will only be possible for humans hundreds , or perhaps thousands , of years in the future			2
but many scientists are of the belief that we will one day be able to create multicellular life - and it stands to reason this could include an organism as complex as a human .			1

asteroid that *killed* dinosaurs may have taken life to @entity19 and @entity21
a computer simulation has found that thousands of life - bearing rocks from @entity4 have hit @entity19 and about six rocks have made it as far as *europa*
the theory **suggests** a future in which humans could colonise space
we would send dna to distant planets and ' print ' a new civilisation , one radical theory **suggests**
