a student from @entity1 was left temporarily blind after surgery to change the colour of her eyes			1
@entity5 travelled to @entity6 , in @entity7 , for the unregulated procedure to change her eye colour from dark brown to light brown			1
she spent £ 8,000 on the operation but it went wrong and she was almost left permanently blind			1
the procedure went wrong and she ended up temporarily blind ms @entity5 decided in 2009 that she wanted to change the colour of her eyes and so she began researching surgical options			1
despite her family ’s horror , she travelled to @entity6 to have a procedure which involved implanting coloured discs – like a contact lenses – into her eyes			1
ms @entity5 told @entity24 ’s @entity25 : ' i was so determined to get the surgery nothing rang alarm bells for me - nothing obvious			2
' when ms @entity5 arrived at the clinic in @entity6 , she was told that she could not have the light brown implants as they were out of stock			1
as a result , the surgeon informed her that she would be given blue implants instead			2
despite this not being her original intention , she decided to go ahead with the operation			0
when ms @entity5 arrived at the clinic , she was told the brown implants were ' out of stock ' and she agreed to have blue ones instead ms @entity5 says that during the procedure she screamed and the surgeon told her not to scream as it ' could cause things to go wrong '			1
to her huge shock , at the end of the 20 minute procedure , ms @entity5 realised she could n’t see properly			2
she says it was as though she was looking underwater but the surgeon told her not to worry and that for some patients it took up to two weeks for vision to return to normal			0
however , by the time ms @entity5 returned to @entity1 her sight had deteriorated further			1
after the operation in @entity6 , her sight deteriorated rapidly and when she returned to @entity1 she had to have another operation ( pictured ) to remove the implants and save her sight even after she had the implants removed , it was three months before ms @entity5 's sight returned to normal she went to @entity61 where she was unable even to read the biggest letter on the optician ’s chart			1
doctors at the hospital had never seen anything like it so were temporarily at a loss as to how to help her			0
eventually , it was decided that the implants had to be removed			2
ms @entity5 risked permanent blindness to go under the knife again			0
this time , surgeons made an incision in her corneas to allow them to remove the implants			0
ms @entity5 said : ‘ when i woke up i saw black			0
i thought if my vision goes , my life will be over			0
' ms @entity5 says she no longer minds what colour her eyes are - all that matters is that she can still see however , the blackness she saw was only caused by the bandaged surgeons had placed over her eyes			1
when these were removed , she was able to see again but her vision was blurry			0
it took two to three months for her vision to return to normal			0
she said : ' now that my eyes are back to normal , my eyes are brown but it does n’t matter what shade of brown it is			2
the main thing is that i can see			0
' botched up bodies will be shown on @entity24 at 10pm tomorrow .			0

@entity5 wanted to change her eye colour from dark brown to light brown so , in 2009 , she flew to @entity7 for *cosmetic* surgery
she spent £ 8,000 having coloured discs implanted into her eyes - the brown implants were ' out of stock ' so she agreed to have blue ones instead
after the operation her sight deteriorated rapidly until she was blind
she went to hospital in @entity1 where surgeons removed the implants
it took another three months before her sight returned to normal
