by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 06:24 est , 24 july 2012 a new kind of bond between atoms found only in the crushingly intense magnetic fields of white dwarf stars could unlock new secrets of quantum physics			1
the find - a ' third kind ' of bond between atoms , unknown on @entity10 - could also unlock the secrets of ultra-powerful new computers			1
the find rewrites the rules of the universe - adding a third kind of bond after the ' ionic ' and ' covalent ' bonds learned by schoolchildren			1
a burned out white dwarf captured by @entity22 : white dwarf stars have magnetic fields 10,000 times stronger than the strongest fields on @entity10 - and the strange chemical bonds occur within the fields a quantum computer would use quibits which , based on theories of quantum physics , would be able to exist in more than one state at once - a zero , one and all values in between			1
a quantum computer would therefore be able to perform calculations in parallel , arriving at the result much , much faster than regular computers			0
however , working out how to store and manipulate quibits has been a major stumbling block in efforts to develop a quantum computer			0
the problem is that in order for a quibit to exist , it must be isolated from its surroundings to stop it being destroyed in a process called decoherence			0
but in order to use a quibit to make calculations , it must be able to interact with other information			0
white dwarf stars have magnetic fields 10,000 times stronger than the strongest fields on @entity10 - and the strange chemical bonds occur within the fields			1
white dwarfs are the final stage of life of stars like our @entity59 - once the thermonuclear furnace inside a star ' burns out '			0
@entity63 and colleagues at the @entity65 of @entity66 were studying white dwarf stars when they found that hydrogen atoms were not behaving like they should			1
now scientists have pushed the limit of how long information can be stored in solid state , outside a vacuum			0
the bonds could not ever be recreated on @entity10 - the magnetism would destroy the apparatus used to recreate it			2
one of the lead reesarchers told @entity79 : ‘ the experimental apparatus would cease to be an apparatus in these extreme conditions ! ’ but the increased understanding of how atoms interact could lead to new discoveries in quantum physics - and even to new generations of quantum computer			2
red giant and white dwarf : white dwarfs are the final stage of life of stars like our @entity59 - once the thermonuclear furnace inside a star ' burns out '			2

third kind of bond after ionic and covalent
found only in white dwarf stars - with magnetic fields 10,000 times stronger than any on @entity10
find rewrites rules of universe
could lead to new discoveries in quantum physics
*techniques* used to analyse bonds could lead to new computers
