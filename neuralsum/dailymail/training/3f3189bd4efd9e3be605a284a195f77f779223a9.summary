catch of the day : this huge grizzly bear was captured on camera salmon hunting in @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 what a whooper : the brown bear sinks its teeth into a large salmon after pouncing on the fish the one that got away : fishing is even a slippery business for bears as this beast appears to lose his lunch mr @entity20 spent ten days at @entity47 camp in the park so he could get up close and personal with the bears to take pictures of them			1
the 39 - year - old , who lives in @entity17 , was lead by guide @entity53 whilst on the trip			1
' fifteen hundred miles upriver from the @entity56 and sitting dead centre on the arctic circle is the most unusual of ecological reserves , ' he said			0
' surrounded by tundra and stunted black spruce forest you 'll find the @entity63			0
' it 's an arctic oasis where trees grow three or four times higher than the surrounding ecosystems and where grizzly bears and salmon play out a life - cycle thousands of years old			1
' i spent 10 days at @entity72 camp with guide @entity53			0
' to get to the lodge and park , i had to drive 500 kilometres north of @entity75 to @entity76 , @entity17			2
' from there it was a two hour helicopter ride @entity80 to the lodge which is located on the @entity82			0
it is one of the remotest locations in @entity86			0

many of the bears were exceptional fishermen			0
the salmon were captured on camera desperately trying to swim away from the predators as he stalks the water hungry hunter : the grizzly bear wades through the freezing river water to get his claws on the salmon the bear is captured charging into the water where he would aim to catch half a dozen fish when one came near the camera , i 'd be about 25 feet away at a viewing platform , and i 'd use my remote to take pictures			1
' some of the bears were great at catching fish , and some had little luck			1
' some would charge into the river fast and pounce on them			0
one bear would snorkel through the deep water and catch them and others would walk the shoreline above the river and jump down on the fish			2
' normally , the bears would come down to the river for an hour and catch half a dozen fish , then they would go into the forest to nap for three hours and return to fish when they woke up			1
' it was a once in a lifetime experience to be so close to these giant bears			0
we would be on viewing platforms not 10 feet away , and the bears would ignore us			0
' it was quite a beautiful experience and special to be able to interact so closely with the bears in a very safe situation			0
it was definitely more exciting than scary			0
' often i 'd put my camera down and just watch in amazement as these grizzlies finished off salmon right in front of you			2
' the bears would spend around an hour - and - a - half catching the salmon before heading back to the forest for a nap mr @entity20 said some of the bears were great fishermen , but others were not so skilled			1
