claim : @entity0 has gone to the court to find out if the word ' golliwog ' is ' inherently discriminatory ' a black chef claims that her white boss racially harassed her when he mentioned the word ‘ golliwog ’ during a conversation about the famous @entity8 ’s jam labels			1
lawyers for @entity0 , 45 , claim that the word is ‘ inherently discriminatory ’ and has ‘ racial overtones ’ and should not have been used in front of their client			1
but her boss @entity13 claims that he was talking about the jam label changing and has apologised to her and said that he had no desire to ‘ violate her dignity ’			1
her lawyers are battling to convince three top judges that the word is inherently offensive to black people and almost always discriminatory - no matter in what context it is used			0
her barrister , @entity23 , told the court : ‘ white people do n’t get called golliwogs			0
the word is an overtly racial comment			0
[ the word ] golliwog can not be interpreted in any other way			0
‘ what the authorities make clear is that , when something is inherently discriminatory and clearly has racial overtones , there is no further debate			0
’ @entity35 jam manufacturers @entity8 ’s started using the @entity37 character , dressed in a yellow waistcoat and bow tie , on its jars from 1910			1
in the late - 1920s , the company started producing popular badges featuring the character , including a golfing , cricketer and footballer version			2
however , the cartoon disappeared from labels in 2002 after decades of controversy and jars of marmalade now feature @entity55			1
the company has always insisted that the @entity37 character was withdrawn for commercial reasons rather than a reaction to the controversy surrounding the figure			2
chef @entity0 is suing her boss for racial harassment after he used the word ' golliwog ' in a conversation about the removal of the controversial character from labels of @entity8 's jam jars of @entity8 's marmalade now feature the far less controversial @entity55 miss @entity0 was working as an assistant chef manager at the @entity74 ’s @entity73 student halls in february 2009 when the comment was made by chef manager mr @entity13			1
he used the word while discussing ‘ the change to the label of @entity8 ’s jam ’ , the court heard			1
but miss @entity0 , of @entity81 , south west @entity82 , was upset and an employment tribunal later found that what mr @entity13 said amounted to ‘ an isolated act of harassment ’			1
he apologised and said that he had not uttered the word for the ‘ purpose of violating her dignity ’			0
the tribunal ruled : ‘ we have concluded that , for a white manager to use the words “ golliwog ” and “ golliwog jam ” in the course of a conversation with a black @entity97 colleague is unwanted conduct			0
’ however , miss @entity0 ’s harassment claim was dismissed after the tribunal said it had been brought too late			2
@entity0 's complaint relates to her time working at a @entity74 hall of residence in @entity73 whether that decision was justified is one of the central issues now being considered by the @entity108 judges			1
miss @entity0 ’s other complaints of race discrimination were dismissed by the tribunal and , although she still has an active victimisation claim , she is asking the court to reconsider the issue			2
her barrister mr @entity23 argued that the tribunal was plainly wrong to dismiss the golliwog complaint purely on grounds of delay			0
however , the @entity74 ’s barrister , @entity120 , insisted that mr @entity13 ’s use of the controverisal word - spoken quietly and quickly - did not come anywhere close to racial harassment			2
‘ i say it is unsatisfactory that somebody should be labelled with a finding of harassment on racial grounds when the actual context in which the word was used was innocent and inoffensive , ’ he told the court			0
lord justice @entity131 , @entity133 and lord justice @entity134 reserved their decision on the case until a later date .			0

@entity0 worked at *university* hall of residence in @entity82
her boss @entity13 was discussing removal of character from jars
@entity8 's used the controversial character on labels until 2001
