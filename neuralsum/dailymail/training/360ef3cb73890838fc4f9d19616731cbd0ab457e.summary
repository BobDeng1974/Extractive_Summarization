in a sweltering @entity1 afternoon , hundreds of guys are sitting in an airless hotel reception room taking notes , hanging on every utterance by the speaker			1
they ’ve paid up to $ 3000 to be here – to learn from the master himself			1
on the podium at the front is n’t a religious guru			1
it is n’t a business leader imparting the secrets of getting rich			1
it ’s a guy dressed in jeans and an unironed shirt – teaching men what should be the most natural thing of all : how to talk to women			1
as a dating coach for @entity27 , the company founded by @entity37 ( @entity38 ) and @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , mr @entity26 and his colleagues have near - rock star status amongst the men who ’ve traveled from across the @entity35 – earnestly writing down every insight on how to make yourself more attractive to women , and how no woman is beyond you			1
' why on earth would you need an excuse to talk to a girl ? ' mr @entity26 thunders from the front of the room			1
scores of baseball caps nod , pencils scribble			1
i ’ve joined the disciples for a weekend ’s bootcamp as part of my tv show , @entity59 : the @entity60 , which explores what it ’s like to be a man today			1
taking notes : the author @entity59 traveled to @entity1 , @entity66 to learn mr @entity26 's secrets of how to pick up women closing the deal : as part of the bootcamp , mr @entity59 was forced to interact with female strangers in public and ask for phone numbers how has it come to this , that men have to pay to learn how to meet women ? i sit through the lectures feeling a little smug and incredulous that guys are paying serious cash for a bit of confidence boosting and common sense			1
never walk directly towards a woman - approach from the side as it 's less threatening 2			1
do n't mumble - speak as though you 're on stage doing a spot of shakespeare 3			2
do n't hang around like a bad smell 4			2
try and take the woman away from her group to talk somewhere quiet 5			2
do n't leave without getting a phone number but then we ’re told that after lunch we ’ve moving from the theory to the practical – chatting up total strangers on the street			2
for a @entity110 bloke , the idea of walking up to a woman on the street , mid-afternoon , entirely sober and having to chat her up with the aim of getting her phone number is a living nightmare			2
committing armed robbery or heading on holiday to northern @entity114 would be less terrifying			2
what on earth would you say as an opening line ? how would you not sound like a complete cheese ball ? before i can bail out , mr @entity26 leads a small group of us down to the main pedestrianized shopping street			1
do n't speak to groups of models about woollen socks 2			2
check for a wedding ring first 3			2
check for a pram first 4			2
do give up when the woman does n't speak a word of @entity131 5			0
do n't fight your national upbringing - drink at least four pints of lager before attempting any interaction women are going about their business – catching up with friends over coffee , popping into shops , heading to fashion week events , and generally displaying no inclination to want to be bothered by men who are paying good money to learn how to bother them			1
as a few of us hang back , he demonstrates that he ’s not all talk			0
he brazenly heads over to @entity149 where a woman is stood outside , walks up to her , asks her where she ’s from and gets chatting			0
just as that ’s going well , another woman walks past on her way into a store – he stops her , and then brings her into the conversation			0
a classic technique - which demonstrates manly confidence , engenders a spot of competition and creates that all - important vibe that ' you ’re at the center of your own party '			0
@entity167 and behold , the second woman then asks for his number and what he ’s doing that night			0
lining up : the author sat in a room packed with men who paid $ 3,000 each to learn how to interact with women buoyed by this display of manliness , i ’m sent off to do my own stranger - bothering			1
the first girl i approach does n’t speak a word of @entity131			0
i deploy my full repertoire ( ‘ glasnost ’ and ‘ perestroika ’ ) – but she remains impassive			0
i ’m then directed to a pair of women who are having coffee			1
neither has any time for me			0
before i ’d even opened my mouth , they raise a hand – traffic cop style – to signal do n’t even think of approaching			0
down but not out , i ’m pushed towards two models – who at least do n’t raise any limbs towards me			0
what then follows is two minutes of dire conversation , where all i can think to ask about is where to buy socks around here , and bore myself into submission , like a football player signalling to the coach that he wants to come off the field			1
in the field : mr @entity26 demonstrates how to master the game by getting a woman 's attention training tactics : mr @entity26 coaches his students to develop enough confidence to approach complete strangers gaining confidence : the men are coached through a series of scenarios and told to visualize themselves being at the center of their own party with confidence shot to pieces , i make my final approach – to a waitress taking a break			1
after some initial confusion about where she came from – ‘ @entity227 ’ and ‘ @entity228 ’ can be easily confused – we manage a nice chat for a few minutes about former @entity231 and cocktails , before i plump up the courage to ask for a phone number			0
which she actually gives me			0
i head off with a renewed sense of swagger – and faith in the @entity35 can - do approach to all aspects of life			0
it was only when my director goes back to interview her that we notice a wedding ring on her finger			0
she ’d given me her number out of politeness			0
you would n’t get that in @entity110			0
@entity59 : the @entity254 airs on the @entity255 on friday , june 27 at 10pm est.			0
