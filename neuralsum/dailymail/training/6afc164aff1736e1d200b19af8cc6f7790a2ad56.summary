by @entity0 published : 16:45 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 06:48 est , 6 november 2012 @entity1 from the @entity2 is pleased that @entity3 has backed down every year since the guns fell silent , the @entity2 have honoured their fallen colleagues with a march through the village			1
that was until they ran into ... an event plan , risk assessment forms , emergency contact details , marshals , traffic management procedures , road closure applications , an evacuation plan and public liability insurance			1
the veterans were issued with the extraordinary list after the council ruled they could not hold their annual parade on @entity22 because they had failed to fill in the correct paperwork			1
instead , officials insisted the veterans would have to replace their proud march on the street to lay wreaths with a stroll along the pavement instead			1
although the list has been withdrawn after a campaign from outraged villagers in @entity34 , @entity35 , the men must still fill in risk assessment forms			1
@entity37 , a former @entity38 mechanic and the @entity2 ’s branch secretary , said of the parade , which has been held for more than 80 years : ‘ it ’s the first year we ’ve had to do all this			0
‘ i did n’t deal with anything like that when i was in the @entity38			0
it is less than five minutes to the memorial			0
then we hold the @entity49 , then it ’s a short march back – ten minutes at the most			2
‘ we ’ve been told we have to marshall the event ourselves			2
but with only seven members , there ’d be no one left			0
’ legion membership secretary @entity1 added : ‘ i would n’t have walked on the footpath , i ’d have walked straight up the road regardless			0
’ a spokesman for the local council said : ‘ the parade will go ahead			0
we ’ve offered to help with the risk assessment			0
’ a spokesman for @entity61 added : ‘ we have the highest regard for the @entity2 and all those involved in the organisation of the annual events and throughout @entity66 officers will be joining them on november 11 to pay our respects to those who have lost their lives in conflict			2
’ last year 's @entity22 is marked in @entity34 the veterans normally march to the war memorial in @entity34			1

a *group* of seven war veterans were told that they would not be *allowed* to march on the road in @entity34 , @entity66
health and *safety* officials said that they had not been provided with the correct applications and *documents*
the council backed down after a campaign by outraged *residents* and the veterans can now march as normal
