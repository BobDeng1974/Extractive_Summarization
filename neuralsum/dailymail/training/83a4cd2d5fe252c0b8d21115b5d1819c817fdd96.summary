by @entity0 a computer programme has been created that write its own moralistic tales , like @entity5 's famous @entity4 and the @entity6 many people will be familiar with @entity5 ’s fables such as @entity4 and the @entity6 , but now there ’s a computer programme that uses artificial intelligence to write its own moralistic tales			1
the @entity13 can create fables around particular combinations of emotions or desires felt by the characters in a story			1
there are 22 emotions to choose from in all			2
it is the next step closer to enabling machines to make meaningful literary works in their own right			1
explaining how the technology works , @entity27 , a phd candidate at the @entity28 in @entity29 , said : ‘ a human author simply decides an interesting emotional path for the story , and the computer does the rest			1
’ ‘ the computer decides the events to elicit those emotional responses from the characters and the characters do whatever the plot needs them to do			2
’ a psychological model known as @entity47 , named after its creators @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , determines the emotions and ms @entity27 's computer programme is based on the @entity47 model			1
the result is a kind of high - tech version of the famed @entity56 storyteller @entity5 , although at the moment , the machine is not quite as eloquent			1
the researchers hope that their computer programme will advance computers ’ abilities to author stories with ever - growing sophistication and complexity			1
ms @entity27 's supervisor , dr @entity65 , predicts that computers ‘ will be making interesting and meaningful contributions to literature within the next decade ’			1
@entity70 there lived a unicorn , a knight and a fairy			2
the unicorn loved the knight			2
one summer 's morning the fairy stole the sword from the knight			2
as a result , the knight did n't have the sword anymore			0
the knight felt distress that he did n't have the sword anymore			0
the knight felt anger towards the fairy about stealing the sword because he did n't have the sword anymore			0
the unicorn and the knight started to hate the fairy			0
the next day the unicorn kidnapped the fairy			0
as a result , the fairy was not free			0
the fairy felt distress that she was not free			0
no humans required ? the researchers hope that their computer programme will advance computers ' abilities to author complex stories - without human writers ( pictured )			1
dr @entity65 , predicts that computers ' will be making interesting and meaningful contributions to literature within the next decade ' ‘ they might be more experimental than mainstream , but the computer will definitely be doing some of the work of writing			1
’ the researchers hope that authors , computer game designers and other creators will see value in the research			0
‘ for us , this is a serious literary project and we want to find artists who can help direct it to that end , ’ dr @entity65 said			2
he believes that one of the benefits of collaboration is the potential to uncover new and exciting possibilities			0
‘ how will this technology be used ? it is impossible to predict			0
we hope artists will take it up and create things we 'd never imagined			0

*scientists* from the *university* of @entity135 in @entity29 created the programme that can write its own moralistic tales
programme is thought to be the next step in enabling computers to make meaningful literary works *independently*
@entity13 creates fables around *mixtures* of emotions
humans decide an ' emotional path ' and the programme writes the rest
experts claim its a hi - tech version of @entity5 , who wrote famous fables
