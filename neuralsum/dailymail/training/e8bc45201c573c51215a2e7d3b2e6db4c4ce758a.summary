a heavily tattooed woman has lashed out at an @entity2 restaurant after being told she would n't be welcomed back if she did n't cover up next time			1
@entity3 , 25 , was on a date at the base bar , at the @entity6 in @entity7 , east of @entity2 's cbd when she says she was approached by a security guard who had a word with her about her tattoos			1
she has taken her disgust , following the incident to social media and says she was left feeling ' insulted ' and ' upset '			1
@entity3 ( pictured ) is disgusted by how she was treated by a @entity7 restaurant the @entity16 ( pictured ) say they did n't mean to cause any grief to the young woman but have policy and procedures to abide by ' you know what 's awesome ? ? paying $ 50 for a pizza and some cider , sitting down to enjoy your meal and the company of a lovely guy , when the security guard from the bar attached next door decides to approach you mid meal , ' she posted on her @entity36 page			1
' he said half way through my meal and we 'd been there quite while that the owners do n't want people with full tattoos there , ' said ms @entity3			1
' i thought it was incredibly rude since i had been in there 15 minutes , given them my money , it was awful , poor business			0
' she said her date also had tattoos and believes the comments were directed at both of them			2
' i was shocked that this kind of thing happens at a bar or pup still			0
' ' hundreds of people have tattoos in @entity2 , they 'd be appalled to hear that happened			2
' ' 10 years ago it was very different , i feel like discrimination like that is one step away from people with being rejected for their colour , ' she said			0
the picture of her finished meal after she was asked to cover up next time she came to the venue , which she used to post an angry message on @entity36 @entity80 ( pictured ) said ' nobody deserves to be insulted when they 're eating a meal they 've paid for ' ms @entity3 hit out at the @entity7 hotel on social media calling them ' discriminatory jerks ' and claiming they waited until after they had finished their meal to tell her			1
' do yourself a favour and boycott this s * * t place , ' she wrote on @entity36			0
' nobody deserves to be insulted when they 're eating a meal they 've paid for			0
and we dressed so nicely ! i 've never been so offended during a meal in my life			0
' the post received a wave of support suggesting the stance by hotel staff was very rude and many claimed it was disgusting to see a person treated in that way			0
responding to some of the comments , ms @entity3 says she had never been kicked out of a place or asked to cover her tattoos , ever , admitting she had been almost everywhere in @entity2			1
@entity80 ( pictured ) says she has never been bothered about her tattoos before the @entity16 in @entity7 says they hope they did n't cause @entity80 ( pictured ) grief but they just have to abide by policy and procedure although admit they may be behind the times ' pathetic , i have never had problems with other guy mates who had ink in the past , ' she continued on her @entity36 page			1
she has been humbled by the response at an incident she has labelled so ridiculous			0
' so many were people horrified by it , it was shared all over @entity133 , shows people are shocked how sad it is , ' she said hotel owner @entity136 says it unfortunate this has blown up saying the hotel simply had policy and procedure to follow			2
' i think we handled it politely and not to cause the young lady any grief , we 're hospitality and we need to appeal to a multiple amount of people 's enjoyment , ' he said			0
' it 's a difficult policy because everything is changing and we need to maybe look at adjusting it , to do business			0
' ' it 's ( having tattoos ) become more socially acceptable than five years ago and that 's a dilemma we face and the question is where do you draw the line			2
' mr @entity161 says the @entity16 has been a family run business for 29 years and they 're certainly not here to cause anyone grief			2
' the dress code is there to keep some sort of restrictions in place , unfortunately we do n't allow for changing trends in fashion and maybe that 's something we should review , ' he said			1
ms @entity3 hopes there will be changes and all pubs , clubs and restaurants will be less judgemental			1
' skin you ca n't change , it would be fantastic if the world would be more open			0
' but whether she 'll consider going back there for a meal , covered up , ' definitely not '			0
@entity80 was on a date at the @entity16 ( pictured ) when she was told by a security guard next time she came to the hotel she would have to cover up her tattoos ms @entity3 's @entity36 friend , @entity191 ( pictured ) had a similar experience with the same hotel years earlier and was told to leave because ' we do n't allow tattooed people in here ' @entity191 ( pictured ) also was told to leave by security at the @entity6 a couple of years ago because she had tattoos that were showing the matter was made aware to @entity133 's @entity200 who stuck up for the restaurant because it was entitled to force dress codes			1
' dress codes , which could include restrictions on visible tattoos , are not grounds for complaint under @entity133 's equal opportunity laws , ' said commissioner for @entity211			1
' in effect , licensed venues have a right to set their own dress code , ' she said			2
another one of ms @entity3 's @entity36 friends says she also had a similar experience at the same hotel years earlier on a quiet thursday evening			1
' i was actually approached by security and rudely asked to leave midway through my meal that i had already paid for because ' we do n't allow tattooed people in here ' , ' said model @entity191			2
she said after a discussion with security she was allowed to finish her dinner before being made to leave			0
' it was very embarrassing and seemed a bit ridiculous considering i had been in the venue over half an hour already , had interacted with multiple staff members , spent money , and was well dressed , polite and well behaved			0
' ' i get having a dress code , and if they want to exclude tattooed people that 's fine because it 's their business and they can do what they want , but they should probably make it a little more clear and enforce that rule upon entry rather than allowing people to hand over money and order food and then asking them to leave , ' she said .			1
