they came for the @entity2 dream debut , they gladly settled for the @entity5 nightmare			2
the @entity7 striker did not score on his return to the @entity9 but a senseless foul in the area from @entity5 gave @entity12 the perfect chance to score from the spot and give his side the first leg advantage			1
@entity17 then rose to head a @entity18 home doubling @entity7 ’s first - leg lead in this last - 16 @entity22 match and deal @entity23 their second defeat in four days			1
@entity5 , so often worthy of ‘ world ’s best defender ’ tag , had one of his incomprehensible lapses dragging down @entity12 in front of referee @entity31 on 58 minutes and @entity12 scored from the spot			2
@entity17 celebrates his goal as @entity7 defeat @entity23 2 - 0 in the first leg of their last 16 @entity22 clash the @entity7 defender heads home from a set piece in the second half to take a two goal advantage to the @entity42 @entity44 's youngest son @entity43 ca n't hide his joy after @entity7 take the lead @entity43 , a ball - boy for the cup match , jumps into his father 's arms on the touchline @entity7 's @entity12 wheels away after opening the scoring with a second - half penalty as @entity2 ( left ) lets out a roar @entity12 strokes home his penalty after being brought down by @entity23 captain @entity5 in the box @entity57 and @entity58 stare on in disbelief as @entity23 slump to their second defeat in as many games in 2015 @entity23 star @entity57 got up close and personal with @entity2 on the @entity7 star 's second debut for the club @entity7 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity67 ; @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity17 , @entity70 ; @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 ) , @entity12 ; @entity76 ( @entity75 ) , @entity2 ( @entity77 )			1

they will need a big result next thursday in the @entity114 and @entity58 will surely start after watching the first half of the first leg from the bench			0
he saw @entity23 almost take the lead in the first minute when @entity5 got his head to a @entity121 corner but headed straight at @entity67			0
it was @entity23 ’s last clear - cut chance of the first half as @entity57 endured a frustrating night and @entity58 was sorely missed alongside him			1
for @entity7 , @entity2 was full of running and the @entity9 roared every time he touched the ball			2
he was too keen on several occasions racing clear into an offside position as @entity23 ’s central defensive partnership of @entity88 and @entity5 played with a high line despite ‘ @entity2 ’s ’ presence and the lightning pace of his strike partner @entity133			1
it was the @entity136 who gave @entity7 their first scare when he robbed @entity88			0
as he honed in on goal his @entity136 @entity138 team - mate @entity88 recovered brilliant and slid in to dispossess him clearing for a corner			0
@entity2 was kicked by @entity91 and the @entity141 was booked			0
but the debutant might have gone into the book himself after clashing with @entity89 under the nose of the linesman			0
he shouted down the same linesman when the flag was raised for another offside			0
he was as animated as the 46,800 inside willing him to return with a goal			0
the second half started with @entity23 going close first through @entity121 wrongly flagged offside receiving the ball on the edge of the six - yard box and then with @entity57 running onto a long cross field pass from @entity89 but trying to pass it into the far corner of @entity67 ’s net and sending it just wide			1
all talk before the start of the game surrounded the return of @entity2 to his former club @entity7 @entity23 talisman @entity58 started the game on the bench after concerns over a knee problem @entity23 captain @entity5 ( top ) almost opened the scoring in the first minute before being denied by @entity85 the former @entity173 striker 's first contribution to his homecoming game was to be ruled offside @entity23 forward @entity94 skips over a sliding challenge from @entity7 defender @entity17 @entity7 manager @entity44 issues instructions to his team from the sidelines at the @entity9 stadium former @entity180 winger @entity57 ( right ) put the ball in the net with a header before having the goal correctly ruled out for offside @entity2 ( left ) attempts to dribble past @entity23 defender @entity89 as both teams struggle to make chances in the first half real defender @entity88 ( left ) times his tackle to perfection top deny @entity7 striker @entity76 a clear opportunity @entity2 remonstrates with the linesman as @entity23 defender @entity89 ( right ) smiles from the ground @entity138 superstar @entity121 lays on the ground after missing a chance to open to scoring for @entity23 @entity2 worked hard and made an important defensive clearance with a header during a corner for @entity23 @entity76 went close again for @entity7 and then came @entity5 ’ moment of madness pulling down @entity12 from behind and leaving referee @entity101 with no choice but to point to the spot			1
it might have been @entity2 ’ magic moment but instead @entity12 stepped up and with almost no run up rifled the spot - kick past @entity85			2
the @entity9 erupted , and @entity44 ’s youngest son @entity43 jumped into his arms to celebrate			1
in the pandemonium the @entity207 coach brought on @entity77 for @entity2			0
the former @entity210 and @entity173 striker had toiled for an hour			0
he had n’t scored but he helped create the atmosphere that now looked like carrying @entity7 over the line			0
@entity102 responded by bringing on @entity58 but a mishit free - kick was the closest he came and with 15 minutes left @entity214 rose to make it two and @entity44 ’s son was back in @entity44 ’s arms			2
it was a night for favourite returning sons and for another famous win for @entity7 over their neighbours @entity23			0
it was the first time @entity2 had ever beaten @entity23 as an @entity7 player and he said : ' there was plenty to celebrate			2
the atmosphere was great and so was the performance but we know that taking a 2 - 0 to the @entity42 is not enough to mean the tie is over			1
we will have to play just as well there to finish the job			0
' @entity12 won and converted a second half penalty to give @entity7 the lead in the @entity235 tie @entity7 team - mates race to congratulate goalscorer @entity12 after taking a 1 - 0 lead on 58minutes @entity17 rises to double @entity7 's lead with a headed goal from a set piece in the second half the @entity243 defender drops to his knees to celebrate handing @entity7 a two goal advantage ahead of the second leg @entity23 introduced @entity58 late in the game but the @entity248 could not make a difference with a free - kick @entity23 superstars @entity90 ( left ) and @entity94 look dejected after slumping to their second defeat of the year @entity7 's midfielder @entity70 ( 2nd left ) smiles at @entity58 as the players leave the pitch			1
