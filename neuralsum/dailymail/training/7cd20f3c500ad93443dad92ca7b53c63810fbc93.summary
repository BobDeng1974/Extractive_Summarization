@entity1 coach @entity0 knew he would have to inject fresh legs into his squad to replace veterans after the @entity5 , but a raft of injuries means he has had to delve deep into his playing stocks for their @entity10 qualifier against @entity11			1
with former captain @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 ending their international careers after the tournament in @entity18 in july , @entity0 was already forced to replace several first choice players			1
against @entity11 on saturday , however , the coach will also be without more than half a dozen key players including new captain @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 has an injury crisis with seven regulars out former captain @entity12 ( second left ) was one of three players to retire after the @entity5 win in @entity18 new captain @entity21 is one of several players unavailable for the two qualifiers to fill the void , @entity0 has recalled @entity35 forward @entity34 , who did not make the @entity5 squad , and in - form @entity38 winger @entity37 , courted also by @entity40			1
' we had him on our list for some time , ' said @entity0 of the 24 - year - old @entity37			2
' in the games against @entity11 and @entity44 we have the chance to increase our lead at the top and move away from the competition			0
' @entity1 , top of the group following their opening win over @entity52 , play @entity44 in @entity53 next week			2
' @entity37 has earned his chance after several outstanding performance for his club			0
he is very strong in one - on - one situations and an outstanding alternative for our attack , ' @entity0 said			0
@entity38 winger @entity37 is one of the new faces hoping to impress @entity34 has been equally impressive since the start of the season and will fill the void in attack left by the absence of @entity14 and @entity27 , with @entity67 also an option up front against the @entity70			1
@entity0 will need all the firepower he can get from @entity34 and @entity37 , who have each netted three times in the league			1
especially with winger @entity77 missing training this week with an injury and @entity80 spending most of the season so far on the @entity83 bench			0
@entity85 's @entity84 , who was nursing a fever this weeek , was also doubtful for the game but has joined up with the team and could be ruled fit for saturday			0
@entity90 playmaker @entity89 will have a key role to play in the absence of @entity21 the coach is also aware , however , that his team will have to defend as well as score goals against their eastern neighbours , with @entity11 striker @entity97 in fine form			2
the @entity99 forward , last season 's top scorer in the @entity102 , has already netted four times in seven league games , including twice last week in their win over @entity106			0
