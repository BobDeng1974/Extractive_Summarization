would n’t it be embarrassing for @entity1 if he blew the title and gifted it to that ‘ specialist in failure ’ @entity5 ? would the @entity6 be able to show his face in @entity10 football again after such humiliation ? it ’s a big call if you think the @entity14 will win the title , but history suggests there is a chance @entity19 could implode			1
this time last year @entity1 was reeling from an unlikely 1 - 0 defeat at @entity22			1
that day at @entity23 @entity19 huffed and puffed , @entity24 was sent off , and @entity1 was charged by the @entity25 after he went on to the pitch to question referee @entity27 @entity19 manager @entity1 gestures to his players during the 1 - 1 draw with @entity30 @entity1 saw @entity19 draw with @entity30 in the same week they crashed out of the @entity31 @entity32 ca n't expect any loyalty from @entity34 if they are not prepared to offer him the same deal as @entity36 if you view @entity38 as anything other than a fantastic player then you have no passion for football they went on to drop points at @entity45 and at home to @entity47 and @entity48			1
in fact , in the world of hypothetical football that we all scoff at but all think about , if you add on even less than half the points @entity19 dropped in the last nine games of last season they would have won the title			2
a year on , @entity19 are huffing and puffing again , dropping points again , and @entity1 went early with his campaign against referees			1
will history repeat itself , or has @entity1 learned from his mistakes ? the @entity19 team looks knackered , does n’t it ? they ’ve made a habit recently of drawing home games , and that cost them dearly in @entity70			1
why is it happening ? youth and energy are missing , and i ’m thinking of three players in particular who might have made a difference , either off the bench , or pitched in to games here and there to energise the team			2
those players are @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
@entity5 has seen @entity86 move to within a point of second - placed @entity88 @entity1 has won a lot of praise for his transfer dealings and i can see why			2
in simple terms , he has improved his best xi and balanced the books at the same time			0
@entity19 may well go on to win the title and that has to be a successful season for them			2
but how can @entity1 explain that @entity31 exit ? how does he account for the lethargy his players have been displaying for the past two months ? the answer lies in the quality of his squad – or rather the lack of it			1
and that ’s down to errors made by @entity1 that have almost gone unnoticed			2
@entity109 has been on fire for @entity111 this season to maintain their position as closest challengers to @entity114 in the @entity116			0
@entity19 's season unravelled last year when they lost away at @entity22 and @entity1 was charged @entity19 had a bad week by their standards last week after going out of @entity70 and drawing in the league i ca n’t help thinking he might have provided some energy and quality at this stage of the season			1
@entity1 ’s decision to sell seemed to be made in haste – the @entity127 made fewer than 10 appearances for @entity19			1
there was a suggestion that issues off the field could have forced @entity109 out			0
i can not believe that , not with @entity1 ’s skills as a man - manager			2
letting him go does n’t look good on @entity1 and hindsight is a wonderful thing of course - but @entity1 is paid a lot of money to be the ‘ @entity6 ’ who spots the kind of things ordinary mortals can not			2
i ’m also a little sceptical of @entity1 ’s insistence that he will put youth in the team some time soon			1
when he made that promise recently he was referring to academy product @entity84 , who has had game time for @entity19 this season of course , but not much – roughly 10 minutes in total			2
even with @entity154 out , deep playmaker @entity84 did n’t get a look in , @entity1 instead preferring to put a centre half in that position			2
@entity82 was sold by @entity1 and the @entity127 has been in excellent form for @entity111 @entity83 scored two excellent goals for promotion - chasing @entity161 against @entity162 @entity163 ( left ) has not seen much first - team action at @entity19 this season @entity1 says the only reason he has n't seen more action is because @entity19 have been under pressure to win lots of games in different competitions			1
i would have thought that would be the perfect reason to use a player like that rather than keep him on the sidelines			0
and what happens next season when @entity19 are competing on all fronts again ? will he be ready then ? strange logic from the @entity19 manager , and the fact they failed to make the quarter - finals of the @entity31 this season proves that he did n't get it right			1
the reliance on @entity187 up front has cost @entity19			0
@entity189 is decent enough , but looks like he needs to play regularly to be truly effective in the @entity190 , and @entity191 will always be a club legend , but wo n’t always be the answer coming off the bench			0
when you need energy , a striker who has just turned 37 is n’t likely to be your best plan			0
@entity199 was @entity19 's only outfield player on sunday under the age of 24 while @entity191 is 37 did you see young @entity19 striker @entity83 score two brilliant goals at the weekend on loan at @entity161 ? his second came after a truly world - class piece of imagination that had me out of my seat			1
the ball came to him just inside the @entity162 half , he had his back to goal			0
he spun round , without the ball , deceived the bewildered defender , then chased the ball into the box and fired home			0
remember the @entity221 moment in 1970 when he dummied the keeper ? it had a hint of that about it			0
it was that kind of quality from @entity229 , except the youngster finished the move off with a goal			0
it was the kind of creativity @entity19 have looked devoid of in recent weeks			1
video mixed feelings for @entity1 over @entity30 draw how the top of the @entity190 looks this kid has done his time on loan in the @entity241 before this season , so why send him back there ? surely his presence at @entity19 would have been no bigger a risk than re-signing an ageing @entity191 ? you could argue he ’s too young and inexperienced - you could even suggest he might not be good enough			1
the truth is we do n’t know if @entity83 could have contributed to @entity19 ’s push on four fronts this season			1
but we do know the striking options @entity1 went with were definitely not good enough			0
has @entity1 done his mate at @entity161 @entity254 a favour at the expense of his own club @entity19 ? i ’ll believe @entity1 ’s commitment to the @entity260 when i see it			1
@entity109 , @entity229 and @entity84 could have provided something currently missing from the @entity19 team			0
two of them are doing it elsewhere , another is receiving high praise at @entity268 , but has gone missing			0
of sunday ’s outfield players who started for @entity19 only one – @entity199 - was under the age of 24			0
if @entity1 ’s tired team make the same errors in the run - in as last season then the title race is still wide open			0
