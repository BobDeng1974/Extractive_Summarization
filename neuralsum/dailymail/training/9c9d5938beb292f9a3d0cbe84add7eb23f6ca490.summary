by @entity1 reporter published : 12:16 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 12:21 est , 21 march 2012 a mother has revealed how she has had to bring her son back from the brink of death five times in a year due to his rare heart condition			1
three - year - old @entity9 ’s heart can stop for up to seven minutes each time he suffers a collapse			1
he is only alive thanks to his mother @entity12 , 28 , who has been trained to revive her son using a hand - held defibrillator which she keeps with her 24 hours a day			2
lifesaver : @entity12 said having to revive her son multiple times was a terrible experience since his first collapse , which happened while he was watching television just over a year ago , @entity9 has suffered five heart failures , three in the last three months			1
but despite his constant brushes with death the cheeky lad , who has been diagnosed with @entity23 , known as ‘ @entity24 ’ , still enjoys running around his home in @entity26 , @entity27			0
@entity12 said : ' he ’s just a normal three - year - old			2
the doctors said he ’s not supposed to run around but i ca n’t stop him			0
' he always racing around the flat and riding on his little electric quad bike			0
' @entity9 , who lives with his mother and grandparents @entity34 , 50 , and @entity35 , 50 , first collapsed while watching tv at his home in january last year			1
quick - thinking paramedics managed to revive the boy and he made a full recovery.but doctors at the city ’s @entity41 failed to diagnose the condition			0
@entity9 ’s family were all trained to use a special hand - held defibrillator so he could return home and continue to attend nearby @entity47			1
in march last year he collapsed again and had to be revived			2
it was only when brave @entity9 ’s heart failed for a third time in december that doctors finally diagnosed him with @entity24 , a heart defect which develops in the womb			1
@entity12 , a former debt collector , added : ' as a mother it ’s terrible to have to watch your son collapse and have to revive him			0
' the first time it happened i did n’t know what to do			0
' at least now i am trained to help him , but i ca n’t go back to work and he ’s off school at the moment			0
' @entity9 was fitted with a special cardiac monitoring device , which was implanted in his chest in january			2
the device detects the moment when @entity9 ’s heart begins to fail and starts to record the condition of his heartbeat for doctors to read when he is taken to hospital			1
the young boy , whose heart failed as recently as last month , will undergo an operation later this year to fit a small permanent defibrillator under his skin that will trigger automatically if his heart begins to fail again			1
@entity12 added : ' he ’s really great , always happy			0
he knows something is wrong with him but he handles it really well			0
' we go for check - ups at @entity85 every six to eight weeks and we are holding various charity events to try and raise money to keep a defibrillator at his school when he is old enough to go			2

@entity9 will be fitted with a permanent defibrillator under his skin later this year that will trigger if his heart begins to fail again
