by @entity0 published : 02:59 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 04:47 est , 20 june 2013 having to put up with stifling heat on the underground is something commonly moaned about by disgruntled passengers particularly during the summer months			2
but commuters on a metro train in @entity7 , @entity8 , were afforded an unusual method of air conditioning - when the carriage doors failed to close			1
apparently unaware that the doors had failed , the driver speeds away from the unknown station on @entity7 's @entity15 as normal			1
a @entity38 video posted by one of the passengers shows travellers curiously , and probably foolishly , poking their heads out of the empty doorways to get a closer look at the tunnel walls as they whizz by			2
the footage shows a young blonde girl gleefully laughing as a fellow passenger gets up from her seat and heads towards the door			1
her dark hair can be seen blowing in the breeze as she leans against the side of the doorway and cools off			0
foolish : one brave passenger decides to get a closer look at the walls of the tunnel and walks over to peer out of the door danger : a second passenger is seen on the film making her way over to the open doors and peaking out at the tunnel amused by what she sees , the blonde decides to get a closer look herself and tentatively pokes her head out into the pitch dark tunnel			1
next its the cameraman 's turn as he decides to take a look and films close to the tangle of high voltage wires that line the tunnel walls			0
but one female passenger spots the obvious danger in what her fellow travellers are doing and is seen forcefully dragging her companion back to his seat when he gets up to get a better look			0
one @entity38 user smartly commented that the doors were n't broken at all but that the air conditioning had stopped working			0
trains on the metro line can travel of speeds of more than 40 mph			0
on camera : the person filming the incident on their mobile phone films the outside of the train speeding through the tunnel sit down : while one passenger enjoys the breeze , another is pulled back to his seat by his companion			2

footage shows the doors failing to close on a @entity110 train in @entity7
rather than grabbing hold of railings , passengers lean out of open doors
a *cautious* woman drags her partner to his seat as he *attempts* to lean out
