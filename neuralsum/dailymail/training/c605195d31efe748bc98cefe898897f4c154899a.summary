by @entity1 reporter published : 18:18 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 06:41 est , 10 march 2014 it 's hardly a surprise that there are @entity7 cameras trained on the home of the @entity9 – now a museum and national treasure where some of the greatest @entity13 novels were written			1
but the decision to nail a camera – complete with an electrical box and cables – to a tree said to have been planted by @entity19 nearly 200 years ago has sparked outrage among literary enthusiasts			1
they now plan to complain to @entity23 about the ‘ eyesore ’ which they say ruins the iconic view of the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
historical : a cctv camera has been nailed to a 160 - year - old tree which was planted by @entity33 outside her family home in @entity28 , @entity29 ' eyesore ' : literary fans claim the camera ruins the iconic view of the @entity9 ' home in @entity29 which is now a museum ' monstrosity ' : fans claim the cctv camera is immediately noticeable upon approaching the property local resident @entity44 , 42 , moved to the town to learn more about the @entity9			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve spent a lot of time at the parsonage , so i quickly spotted this camera which had just been stuck on to a tree that ’s 160 years old			1
they ’ve nail - clipped a cable up the back of the tree which has gone into a big grey box and they ’ve then lashed jubilee clips around the tree trunk			2
' i think they hoped no - one would notice it , but they ’ve placed this monstrosity right in the middle of their most iconic view			1
@entity33 wrote her classic novel @entity68 at the parsonage ‘ the tree is one of the last remaining things of the @entity9 ’ and they ’ve treated it like a botched job on a telegraph pole			1
’ it is believed @entity19 , who wrote her 1847 novel @entity68 at the parsonage , planted two cypress - pines with her husband @entity82 in 1854 to commemorate their wedding			2
she died the following year			2
one was felled in 2008 due to disease , but the remaining tree is a vital link with the past			2
a spokesman for the @entity91 , which runs the museum , said : ‘ we take seriously any concerns made to us about such matters			0
we will be carrying out our own investigations			0
’ in 2010 the @entity97 , which includes the @entity99 - listed parsonage , was added to @entity23 ’s at - risk register due to modern additions and poor maintenance in the town , which were said to be eroding its character			0
it was removed from the list in october last year			0
an @entity23 spokesman said : ‘ we were recently asked to comment on listed building consent for a number of alterations to the @entity27 , including the addition of @entity7			0
‘ we advised that it should be fixed to mortar joints , to minimise damage to the masonry			0
the application did not cover @entity7 units in any other location			0
in many cases the installation of @entity7 can take place without planning consent			0
