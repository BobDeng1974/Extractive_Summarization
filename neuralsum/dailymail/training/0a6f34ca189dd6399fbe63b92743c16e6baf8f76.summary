the initial reaction when @entity1 announced that he will quit the ring in 2016 was to despair that the fight against @entity4 which the world has been waiting an eternity to see had been scuppered once and for all			1
the reverse may be the case			0
not least because the @entity1 was actually deferring his retirement date			0
the last time i discussed the matter with @entity1 he talked of going into full - time @entity14 politics next year			2
first , as he agreed to his september 13 rematch with @entity31 , @entity4 went public with a teaser for us to expect a surprise announcement for his ensuing fight , scheduled for next may			1
since @entity37 is hoping that will be when he gets his overdue shot at the @entity41 man , nobody got over-excited			2
but an alternative scenario has arisen from the fall - out following a huge promotional upheaval in @entity26 boxing			0
golden boy @entity46 , after splitting with long - time partner @entity45 , has brokered a peace with @entity50 ’s @entity49 outfit which should lead to big fights between boxers in each of those stables			0
speculative : @entity54 boxer @entity37 wants a run at @entity4 in may 2015 @entity4 ’s long - running feud with @entity50 , the @entity1 ’s promoter , and insistence he would never work with him again , has been considered the major obstacle to potentially the mother and father of fights in recent times			1
@entity4 , although a close ally of @entity45 , is having to honour a contract for @entity46 to promote his second battle with @entity31			2
but he has applied successfully for promoter ’s licenses for his own company in @entity70 as well as @entity71			0
that has widened his options and reports are circulating in @entity75 of @entity4 ’s battle - bus – a luxury coach emblazoned with his image – being parked for several hours last week outside @entity50 ’s @entity49 offices there			0
furthermore , @entity4 ’s $ 200 million - plus , six - fight contract with the @entity82 cable tv network is due to come to an end in september 2015 , by which time @entity1 had originally planned to hang up the gloves			1
@entity86 challenges @entity31 to put his money where his mouth is undefeated : @entity4 has never lost a fight in his career , and would love to finish with a win over @entity1 if he wins those three fights , starting with @entity31 , @entity4 will equal the 49 – win , undefeated record which @entity94 took with him into retirement			1
what better way to try to surpass that all - time mark than by going for 50 not out in what would be the last fight for both @entity1 and himself ? what better reason for the @entity14 congressman to wait just a few months longer before running for his country ’s @entity104 ? put the television rights for that one in may 2016 and the pair of them would share a mind - boggling bonanza of at least $ 300 million from by far the richest fight in boxing history			1
come on , boys , you know it makes sense .			0

@entity1 announced he will retire from the ring in 2016
the @entity14 boxer has plans to go into politics after he hangs up his gloves
@entity1 is yet to fight @entity4 , with the world waiting to see what would be the richest bout in the sport *'s* history
@entity4 will fight @entity31 in may , and has said there will be a surprise announcement regarding a bout in may 2015
@entity37 is hoping that will be his chance to take a shot at @entity4
if @entity4 fights @entity1 before the @entity14 retires , the fight would be worth in the region of $ *300million*
