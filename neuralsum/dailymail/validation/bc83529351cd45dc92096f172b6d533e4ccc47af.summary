it 's an irrefutable truth			2
nothing goes better with eggs than bacon			0
but the perfect pairing ? finding @entity6 actor @entity5 serving up some eggs in your kitchen			1
the @entity10 seem to have cracked it by running a series of online and print advertisements featuring the affable a-lister			1
the short video , filled with bacon puns , shows that the actor does n't take himself too seriously			0
the highly entertaining tongue - in - cheek advertisement opens with a woman making scrambled eggs for breakfast when @entity5 appears in her kitchen , lying suggestively across the counter			1
the hilarity kicks off as he then spouts a string of mirth - inducing puns			0
and the memes have started ... come here for your @entity5 : the tongue - in - cheek advert last for two minutes and is filled with puns ' nobody knows eggs better than @entity5 , ' he says , smouldering suggestively			1
he then goes on to wax lyrical on the goodness of eggs as the woman listens wide - eyed and breathless			2
' you know i love the smell of bacon in the morning , ' he says as he takes the plate of eggs away from her			0
' and i like the smell of @entity5 , ' she states , as she leans in to sniff the footloose actor , just as her husband walks in			2
the meta advert – at one point the actress says ' you sound like a commercial ' – has been wildly praised for its tongue - in - cheek approach to eggs			1
the @entity10 said it 's the first time the group is using a @entity6 celebrity in a major marketing push			2
but which bacon are they talking about here ? the ad is full of funny moments like this the online campaign is supported by print advertisements which also reference the star 's last name the campaign comes at an opportune moment ; eggs which were long shunned and viewed as high - cholesterol are now back in vogue in the fickle world of food fashion due to their high protein content			1
@entity88 , ceo of @entity89 , an egg producer in @entity90 , @entity91 , said that he 's glad the egg board is taking a slightly edgier approach in its marketing			0
mr @entity88 said : ' i always felt like egg farmers were too conservative			0
' the ' @entity97 with @entity5 ' push by the ad agency @entity99 is an update on the ' @entity97 ' campaign that launched in 2012			1
' with a last name like @entity5 , i 'm the obvious choice , and i 'm excited to be a part of the new @entity107 campaign , ' the actor said			1
' i like the creativity behind the idea , and i 've always been a big fan of eggs			0
' the egg and @entity113 pairing has been received with delight @entity114			0
the @entity116 made a joke of its own : ' there is now officially only one degree of separation between @entity5 and eggs			2
' user @ diannenice said : ' is there nothing @ @entity126 ca n't do ? radio station @entity127 tweeted : ' can anyone tell us why this took until 2015 to happen ? '			0
