an ancient carnivorous reptile with teeth shaped like steak knives has been named			2
@entity3 roamed the @entity4 240 million years ago and had bony plates on its back like a crocodile , with legs underneath its body like a dinosaur			1
the skeleton , which has taken more than 1,000 hours to reconstruct , may help experts to fill in gaps in the ancient reptile family tree			1
what a find ! palaeontologists have discovered an ancient carnivorous reptile with teeth shaped like steak knives			2
@entity3 roamed the @entity4 240 million years ago and was heavy - bodied with limbs under its body like a dinosaur			2
an illustration of the 9 ft ( 3 metre ) reptile is shown the nine foot ( three - metre ) reptile was one of the larger reptiles that lived before dinosaurs roamed the planet			0
‘ the full name is actually @entity35 , ' @entity31 , an assistant professor of geological sciences at @entity33 explained			0
the name means ‘ predator crocodile ’ with ‘ unda ’ meaning predator in @entity39 and ‘ suchus ’ a reference to a crocodile in @entity43			1
a distant relative ? the ancient reptile had bony plates on its back like a crocodile ( a stock image is shown ) with legs underneath its body like a dinosaur			1
its name means ‘ predator crocodile ’ with ‘ unda ’ meaning predator in @entity39 and ‘ suchus ’ a reference to a crocodile in @entity43 name : @entity35 meaning : predator crocodile , with ' unda ' meaning predator in @entity39 and ' suchus ' a reference to a crocodile in @entity43			1
the later part comes from the town , @entity68 , where the bones were found			1
age : the reptile lived 140 million years ago distinctive features : it had bony plates on its back like a crocodile , with legs underneath its body like a dinosaur , as well as teeth that have been likened to steak knives			1
skeleton location : it was found in @entity68 , south west @entity85			1
importance : the bones may help experts to fill in gaps in the ancient reptile family tree			2
' the " songeaensis " comes from the town , @entity68 , near where we found the bones , ' professor @entity31 said			1
‘ the reptile itself was heavy - bodied with limbs under its body like a dinosaur , or bird , but with bony plates on its back like a crocodilian			1
’ the 32 - year - old academic has discovered seven reptiles and dinosaurs in the past decade , and was involved in naming 17			2
he discovered the partial skeleton in 2007 when he was a student but it has taken years to piece the bones together , which were in thousands of pieces			1
while a large number of skeleton bones were found , most of the skull was not recovered			1
@entity3 was discovered close to a town in southwestern @entity85 while professor @entity31 and a team of researchers were looking for prehistoric relatives of birds and crocodiles			1
‘ there 's such a huge gap in our understanding around the time when the common ancestor of birds and crocodilians was alive - there is n't a lot out there in the fossil record from that part of the reptile family tree , ’ he said			1
‘ this helps us fill in some gaps in reptile family tree , but we 're still studying it and figuring out the implications			2
’ @entity3 was found while professor @entity31 ( pictured ) and a team of researchers were looking for prehistoric relatives of birds and crocodiles			0
here , he collects bones at the site the bones were collected in @entity68 , southwestern @entity85 ( shown on the map ) in 2007			1
its skeleton was found in thousands of pieces and took more than 1,000 hours to reconstruct professor @entity31 said that he realised very quickly what he had found			1
‘ sometimes you know instantly if it 's new and within about 30 seconds of picking up this bone i knew it was a new species			0
‘ i had hoped to find a leg bone to identify it , and i thought , “ this is exactly why we 're here ” and i looked down and there were bones everywhere			2
‘ it turns out i was standing on bones that had been weathering out of the rock for hundreds of years - and it was all one individual of a new species			2
’ the reptile was recorded in the @entity169			2
prehistoric crocodiles were able to run around like dogs to escape the jaws of predatory dinosaurs			0
this is according to a study published last year that showed , for the first time , how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world			0
today , most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish , but their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean , imitating the behaviour of whales			0
today , most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish			0
but their ancestors ( pictuerd ) were very different creatures , with some running around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean , imitating the behaviour of whales the study , by @entity203 , revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments			0
the team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the @entity216 - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years			0
the study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the @entity220 seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey , such as fish			0
sample of jaws from the @entity216 crocodile record the research also found that variation peaked again in the @entity230 period - 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food			0
the research also found that variation peaked again in the @entity230 period - 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food			0
after the devastating end - triassic extinction event , crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish			0
they also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the @entity230 - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs , including eating plants			0
surprisingly , the lower jaws of @entity230 crocodiles did not have a huge amount of variation			0
instead , the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy , such as armadillo - like body armour .			0

@entity262 had bony plates on its back like a crocodile
name means ‘ predator crocodile ’ with ‘ unda ’ meaning predator in @entity39
@entity274 reptile also had legs underneath its body like a dinosaur
its skeleton was discovered in @entity68 , south west @entity85
despite missing a skull , it took over 1,000 hours to piece bones together
