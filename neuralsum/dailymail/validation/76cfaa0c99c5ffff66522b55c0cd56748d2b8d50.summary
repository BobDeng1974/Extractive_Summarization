unless your name is @entity3 , @entity4 or @entity5 , sport is probably nothing more than an enjoyable hobby			2
now a new study has revealed that your choice of sport says more about you than you could possibly have imagined			2
according researchers , cyclists are more likely to be emotionally stable , runners the most extrovert and swimmers the happiest , while walkers are the least materialistic			1
cyclists , for instance , are most likely to vote @entity31 and tend to be laid back and calm , if keen on acquiring material possessions			1
meanwhile runners tend to be @entity35 - voting extroverts who love being the centre of attention and have a penchant for upbeat dance music			2
those who swim tend to make the best lovers , are tidy and are also the most charitable , although according to @entity41 , 61 per cent of adults are fond of charity regardless of their choice of sport			1
walkers , a category that includes those who enjoy rambling , orienteering and trekking , are least concerned about material possessions and like their own company			1
' it has long been known that exercise is not only good for your body , but also your mind , ' comments neuropsychologist , dr @entity57			2
extrovert : runners such as @entity5 tend to be extroverts with a taste for upbeat music the research claims cyclists love shopping and vote @entity31 ' past research has shown that exercising can act as a mood - enhancer , can be used to treat and possibly even prevent anxiety and generally has a positive effect on mental health			1
' the results from this study show that no matter what kind of person you are , there is the right kind of exercise for everyone			0
' the study , which was commissioned by the @entity81 to mark the launch of its 2015 series of events , also found that favourite sports vary by area			0
thus in @entity88 and @entity89 , cycling is the sport of choice for most while running wins the race in @entity94 and @entity95			0
swimming was most popular in @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , while walking was most loved in @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
