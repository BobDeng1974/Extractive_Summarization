@entity0 are ready to spend £ 100million in a transfer window for the first time in their history as @entity5 continues the revamp of his squad			1
@entity5 has already paid out £ 57million to sign @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 but he has a further £ 75million in his kitty after selling @entity13 to @entity14 and intends to use that money to add another four , possibly five , new faces			1
the @entity0 manager wants his squad to have class and depth and is adamant he will be able to attract top talent despite @entity21 rejecting a move to @entity23 in favour of @entity25 – a decision @entity5 says was based purely on the @entity28 ’s desire to live in @entity29			1
ready to spend : @entity5 has already purchased over £ 50m of talent this summer and is still in the market joining the club : @entity9 and @entity10 have joined the likes of @entity34 to support @entity35 @entity21 would have been an outstanding acquisition but @entity5 has other ideas of how he can replace the 31 goals @entity13 scored last season and @entity40 forward @entity41 is a serious option to come in and work alongside @entity8 and @entity35			1
a move for @entity45 ’s @entity44 looks unlikely due to the player ’s financial demands but @entity5 and his recruitment team will continue to explore options so that @entity0 have the right balance ahead of campaign in which they will return to the @entity52			2
‘ the signings we have made have absolutely no relation to @entity13 going – these were players that were always earmarked to come in , ’ @entity5 explained			1
‘ we felt last year we never had the depth ; we are in the @entity59 this year so we have to ensure we have a strong as squad as possible			0
‘ obviously @entity13 going gives us the clout to go and spend more and we are getting the right type of player in			2
arrivals : @entity9 ( left ) , @entity10 ( right ) and @entity8 ( below ) have already been brought in @entity65 criticises @entity66 over @entity0 bid ' we certainly wo n't spend just for the sake of spending – it has to be the sort of player who is going to improve us			1
’ lining up : how @entity0 may look at the start of this coming season @entity5 missed out on three big targets last summer – @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 – but he does not believe @entity21 preference for joining @entity25 shows @entity0 , who are confident they will sign @entity66 central defender @entity82 , can not compete for the best signatures			1
‘ that ( @entity21 ) was one where geography dictated where he wanted to go , simple as that			2
if anything , it ’s been other way ( and @entity0 are an attraction )			0
' lots of players are really impressed by what we are doing as club and really excited about coming to @entity0			0
‘ it was not lack of ambition from the club ( that @entity21 went to @entity25 )			2
the player and his family want to choose to live wherever that is			0
@entity21 is a fantastic player and would have suited us ; his profile would have been great but it was not to be and we move on			2
’ replaceable ? @entity5 knows he has to replace the goals and creativity that @entity13 provided last year @entity13 ’s sale leaves @entity35 as @entity0 ’s first choice forward – the @entity112 international will return to training next week on the pre-season tour of the @entity114 – but @entity5 does n’t want his team to be too reliant on one source of goals			1
‘ in the times @entity119 has played up there without @entity13 , he has shown his qualities , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ but the onus is not really on one player			0
our strength has been the team			0
when i came in , @entity13 was talked of as someone who did n’t score regularly , get enough opportunities or take them			0
‘ the last two years proved that with the number of chances we create that you can get goals			0
but it was not just about @entity13			0
we scored 101 goals last season and he got 31 of them			0
' we have goals all cross the team and will bring in players we think can assist with making them			0
’ yes he can : @entity141 midfielder @entity11 has also joined this summer as part of the spending spree video new @entity0 signing eyes @entity145 trophy			1

reds have already signed @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 this summer
@entity23 side still trying to sign @entity82 among others
@entity13 transfer earned club £ 75million
club missed out on @entity21 over ' geography '
@entity5 *insists* club ' wo n't spend just for the sake of spending '
