a moose buried by an avalanche on an @entity5 mountain had its luck changed by three men passing on snowmobiles			1
the three @entity9 residents were about 55 miles northeast of @entity10 when they passed a small hillside that had both ski and moose tracks			2
when they returned an hour later , an avalanche had covered the tracks			1
this moose was about to freeze to death when friends @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 noticed its snot in the snow and dug it out @entity19 says he saw something move in the debris â€” and was surprised when he inspected it closer alongside friends @entity20 and @entity21			1
' it looked like a guy 's arm at first because we were expecting to see a skier , ' @entity19 told the @entity34			2
' but it was moaning and groaning and moving and we realized it was a moose , even though only his ears and some of its snout was sticking out of the snow			1
he added : ' there was just enough of its snout sticking above the snow that it could breathe			1
' two of the men began digging while third stood as an avalanche lookout			2
' it did n't even fight us , ' @entity19 told the @entity34			0
' it was like , ' help me			0
' it was totally docile and let us touch it			0
it just ( lay ) there			0
' then , after 10 minutes of digging , the moose began to move			1
' it stood right up and towered over us , because we were in kind of a hole from the digging , ' @entity19 told the @entity34			0
' it looked like the abominable snowman because its fur was so packed with snow and it looked at us , shook the snow off it , and off it went			1
' the moose was at ' full steam , ' he says			2
' i am an animal lover , and i could n't leave it there , ' @entity19 told the @entity34			0
' besides , we deal with a lot of avalanches and a lot of snow			0
that kind of karma is something we do n't pass up			0

friends out on a snowmobile ride in @entity5 saw something odd in the debris after an avalanche , and were surprised to find it was a snout sticking out
the animal , which was completely covered , was moaning and *grunting* as it *slowly* froze to death under the *weight* of the *freshly* *-* fallen snow
the good *samaritans* dug for 10 minutes until they freed the animal
the moose looked at its *rescuers* , shook off the snow and ran away
