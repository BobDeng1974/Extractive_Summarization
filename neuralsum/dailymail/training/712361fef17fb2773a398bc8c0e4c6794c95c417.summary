three black people are among the 12 - member grand jury hearing evidence in the @entity3 case			1
@entity4 , director of judicial administration for @entity5 , confirmed the racial and gender makeup of the grand jury on friday			1
@entity10 prosecutor @entity9 has said it will be several weeks before a decision is made on whether to charge @entity13 , the @entity14 officer who shot and killed @entity3 on aug. 9			1
the grand jury consists of six white men , three white women , two black women and one black man			1
nine votes are needed to indict			0
the ages and hometowns of the jurors were n't released			1
a judge is expected to consider monday whether to make that information public			0
the @entity26 also is investigating @entity3 's death			1
many say they just hope the grand jury 's decision , whatever it is , has irrefutable facts to back it up			1
@entity47 sen. @entity46 told @entity48 she 's pushing for federal and local investigations to be completed around the same time so that all evidence in the case can be made public - a step many consider important should prosecutors decide not to charge the officer			2
her office said friday that the @entity26 has n't given a timeline for the federal investigation , which centers on whether a civil rights violation occurred when officer @entity13 fatally shot the unarmed @entity3 aug. 9			2
@entity46 , a former prosecutor in @entity59 , said she 's hopeful the physical evidence in the case - including blood spatter patterns , clothing and shell casings - will provide " incontrovertible facts " about what happened during the shooting			1
she said whatever local prosecutors decide , it will be important to explain the decision by providing that physical evidence , and that wo n't be possible if the federal investigation is ongoing			2
@entity14 has been rocked by the shooting			0
protesters are seen on august 20 in @entity76 , @entity59 doubts : others have questioned district attorney @entity9 's impartiality in the case @entity46 said she urged attorney general @entity81 during a meeting earlier this week to speed up what is typically a lengthier federal process			1
' what we want to avoid is a decision being made without all the information being available to the public also , ' @entity46 said , adding that not being able to do so could ' create more stress and certainly much more fear that we would be back to worrying about people being able to protest safely			0
' ' obviously all of us are concerned not just about that this process be fair , but what does this next six months look like ? ' she said			0
many residents who live in the @entity14 , eager to end the disruptions to their lives caused by protests and police presence , say they fear the community 's anger will explode anew if @entity13 is n't charged			2
' this officer has to be indicted			0
i 'd hate to see what happens if he is n't			0
the rioting , the looting , man ... , ' said resident @entity110 , 29 , as he stopped at the memorial for @entity3 where he was killed			2
@entity10 prosecutors this week convened a grand jury to begin hearing evidence in the case , despite concerns among some in the community - including @entity3 's parents - that the office would not be impartial because of district attorney @entity9 's ties to law enforcement			1
@entity9 's father , mother and other relatives worked for @entity5 police , and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect			1
he has said he will not remove himself from the case			0
the jury hearing evidence in the @entity3 case consists of six white men , three white women , two black women and one black man considering the racial tensions of the case , even the makeup of the grand jury was being closely scrutinized			1
two black women and one black man are on the 12 - member panel , along with six white men and three white women , said @entity4 , director of judicial administration for @entity5			1
without specifically mentioning the grand jury 's racial makeup , the @entity3 family 's attorney , @entity151 , said the panel ' works perfectly ' as long as the prosecutor presents the necessary evidence and does n't withhold information			1
@entity151 said the family does n't believe the grand jury was necessary , arguing that the prosecutor had sufficient grounds to charge the officer on his own			2
the @entity26 opened a parallel investigation , sending dozens of @entity162 agents to @entity14 to question witnesses			0
finishing both investigations simultaneously would be unusual because federal investigators typically work independently of their state counterparts and at their own pace , said @entity168 , a former federal judge who is a @entity169 law professor			0
' that is one of the advantages of a federal investigation			0
they tend to have a little more distance from the police officers who are being investigated			0
that provides some assurance of objectivity , ' he said			0
he said prosecutors must avoid considering the potential reaction - even a violent one - on whether to file charges in any case			2
he said they must make ' a dispassionate judgment uninfluenced by public opinion			0
' the most likely state charges that will be considered in such a case include second - degree murder , voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter , he said .			0
