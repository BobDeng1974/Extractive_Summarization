a family @entity1 were in for a nasty surprised after they returned from a visit out - of - town visit to a dying relative to find someone else had moved into their house			1
their outrage has now turned into a court battle , pitting them against a man who says he has the court documents to prove the house is now his			0
@entity16 moved into the home that had been occupied for 21 years , changed the locks and emptied the house			1
it 's called a ' quiet title ' and lays claim to the property because @entity16 says the family abandoned the house and gave up all their rights			1
the family members have said they are too afraid to be identified			0
' what he 's looking for is full title and ownership of the home , ' the family 's attorney , @entity47 , said			0
wreckless : the former family who used to live in this home say their lives have been turned upside down by @entity58 ' actions @entity16 expects to pay nothing to keep the home			1
' he 's in their home			0
they do n't know when he 's there			0
he can be there now , ' @entity64 said			0
@entity66 has uncovered 11 other instances where @entity16 has filed the same paperwork			1
seven of the cases were filed on the same day			2
' when you abandon a property and do n't want anything to do with it , somebody can come in and take it , '' @entity75			2
' i have a team of people who go out and i say make sure the house is empty			0
if it 's empty , change the locks , ' @entity16 said			1
' anybody can do it			0
' the family from @entity85 who do n't want to be identified say they feel violated			0
' i 'm very scared , you know , because i never know if somebody 's going to be here , ' the homeowner said			0
their attorney told @entity93 the legal fight is adding to a painful year for the family			0
making sense in his world : @entity16 went into the home , changed the locks and emptied the house			1
the family said when they confronted @entity16 , he showed them a document he filed with the @entity105 court documents : @entity16 has filed for ownership of 11 ' abandoned ' homes in the area			1
@entity111 were applied for in court on the same day they could be dismissed as a nuisance , a loose network of individuals living in the @entity116 who call themselves “ sovereign citizens ” and believe that federal , state , and local governments operate illegally			2
some of their actions , although quirky , are not crimes			0
the offenses they do commit seem minor , like creating false license plates , driver ’s licenses , and even @entity129 , a closer look at sovereign citizens ’ more severe crimes , from financial scams to impersonating or threatening law enforcement officials , gives reason for concern			1
if someone challenges ( e.g. , a standard traffic stop for false license plates ) their ideology , the behavior of these sovereign - citizen extremists quickly can escalate to violence			1
since 2000 , lone - offender sovereign - citizen extremists have killed six law enforcement officers			1
in 2010 , two @entity145 police officers stopped sovereign - citizen extremists @entity147 and his 16 - year - old son @entity148 during a routine traffic stop on @entity150			1
@entity151 jumped out of the vehicle and opened fire with an @entity155 assault rifle , killing both @entity157 sovereign - citizen threat likely will grow as the nationwide movement is fueled by the @entity159 , the economic downturn , and seminars held across the country that spread their ideology and show people how they can tap into funds and eliminate debt through fraudulent methods			1
as sovereign citizens ’ numbers grow , so do the chances of contact with law enforcement and , thus , the risks that incidents will end in violence			2
law enforcement and judicial officials must understand the sovereign - citizen movement , be able to identify indicators , and know how to protect themselves from the group ’s threatening tactics			1
@entity16 has been charged with breaking and entering in one case of disputed ownership but he is even fighting that charge			1
quiet title actions are used to determine who legally holds the title to property , because real estate may sometimes change hands frequently , and the lawsuits can help remove clouds over claims of ownership			2
the suits are also used by so - called sovereign citizens , who believe they alone get to decide which laws to obey – particularly tax and property laws — based on what they determine to be the founding fathers ’ intent			1
the antigovernment movement has grown in recent years and is rooted in the anti-semitic , anti-black and anti-tax @entity209 movement of the 1970s and 1980s			0
most recent recruits to the sovereign citizens movement found themselves in desperate situations , often due to the economy or foreclosure , and are drawn to the idea of easy money or living free of legal consequences			2
sovereign citizens are becoming well - known by the courts for filing astronomical liens against banks , attorneys and government employees			2
while these are usually unsuccessful , they can be expensive to fight and take a long time to resolve			0
the @entity226 has been informed about the case but wo n't comment on the specifics			0
' they 'll come together as groups to receive training , how to conduct some of these schemes from a financial standpoint , to understand what they consider the common law and how they can use that common law for their sovereign purposes , ' the family in @entity241 called the court fight a nightmare			2
' it 's really been hard , ' the homeowner said .			0

@entity16 defies authorities and *seizes* *‘* abandoned ’ @entity1 homes
@entity16 has been charged with breaking and entering in one of the cases , but he ’s fighting the charge
homes are taken by @entity16 who is a ' sovereign citizen ' , who believes he can pick and choose which laws to obey , particularly particularly tax and property laws
