by @entity0 published : 13:27 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 15:45 est , 15 august 2013 lockdown : @entity2 , pictured today , as he is sentenced to life in prison at an @entity6 court a man who posed as a @entity2 heir has been sentenced to 27 years to life in prison for a 1980s murder in @entity11			1
@entity2 was sentenced on thursday in @entity12 for the killing of @entity14 , who disappeared along with his wife @entity15 in 1985			1
@entity14 â€™ bones were later dug up in the backyard of a suburban @entity19 home where @entity2 had been a tenant living under a false name			1
the @entity22 immigrant also vanished around that time and in the following years masqueraded across the @entity23 under a series of identities			1
one of his most fantastical was when he styled himself as @entity2 , a pretender to the dynasty 's oil fortune			1
he also had stints as a movie producer and a wizard of @entity32			1
publicity over his conviction in the @entity36 kidnapping of his own daughter led investigators to re-examine the @entity11 cold case			0
at his sentencing on thursday , @entity2 represented himself after firing his lawyers			1
he again asserted that he did not commit the murder of @entity14 and asked to read a voluminous motion he had submitted to the court			2
when superior court judge @entity45 refused , he withdrew the motion			2
the hearing was marked by an emotional statement from @entity14 ' sister , who said some questions in the case will never be answered			0
she said that until his dying day , her father always asked : ' why @entity14 ? ' she told the judge : ' you can not give me back my brother			2
all i as is that you hold mr. @entity2 accountable			1
' there is great public interest , ' he said			0
' it would save time for the media			0
' the judge told him his motion would become part of the public file where anyone can read it			2
but it did not become part of the public record because at that point @entity2 said : ' if i do not get to read the motion , i will withdraw it			1
' the judge said it was his right			0
asked if he had any last words for the court , @entity2 said : ' i can only say again i want to assert my innocence			1
i did not commit the crime for which i was convicted			0
' @entity2 , 52 , insisted from the outset he was innocent			1
the @entity22 immigrant who fooled friends , lovers and a wife during an extraordinary three - decade charade took over his own representation after a jury convicted him of first - degree murder in the death of @entity14 , whose bones were found buried at a suburban @entity19 home			1
fighting alone : @entity2 carries his legal documents into court on august 15 after he fired his lawyers and decided he would represent himself it was a heavily circumstantial case built 28 years after @entity14 vanished			1
there was no slam - dunk dna solution to a murder mystery			2
but discovery of the bones buried for two decades in a backyard where the defendant had lived added a crucial piece to the puzzle of the man who later called himself @entity2			1
@entity14 , a 27 - year - old computer programmer who was the son of the defendant 's landlady , vanished with his wife , @entity15 , in 1985			1
no trace of her has been found			0
@entity2 hinted at a recent hearing that he might have information about her whereabouts			2
at @entity2 's trial , witnesses now old and frail testified about the stranger who came into their elegant town , befriending church members who invited him into their homes			1
their testimony exhumed the ghosts of the happy young newlyweds , who inexplicably vanished shortly before the man then known as @entity150 also disappeared			0
it turned out he was off on a decades - long odyssey across the country			2
variously known as @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity2 , he wormed his way into high society and important jobs , married a wealthy woman and controlled her funds			2
sentenced : @entity2 from @entity22 speaks to guards as he attends his murder trial at @entity12 but his identity unraveled when he kidnapped their daughter during a custody dispute			1
the resulting publicity led @entity11 authorities to revisit the @entity14 disappearance and the bones found in @entity19 in 1994			0
he was near the end of his sentence in @entity173 for kidnapping his young daughter , when he was charged with murder			0
the @entity11 case was circumstantial , built from memories and bits and pieces of evidence , primarily the bones found with a bag bearing the logo of a university once attended by the defendant			0
with the passage of time and lack of a motive , the prosecutor had a difficult challenge			0
' sometimes you 're afraid that this guy 's conned so many people for so many years that this will be the one last time he pulls off his last con , ' the prosecutor after the verdict			0
' but that did n't happen			0
' the defense attorney at the time , @entity200 , said that @entity2 probably was his own worst enemy			2
' the way he went through life deceiving people did not make him very likable to the jury , ' @entity200 said			0
' but that does n't make him a killer			0
' jurors took a scant six hours to convict him			0
prosecutors did not seek the death penalty			0
focus : @entity2 protested his innocence in his closing remarks at trial again today			1

@entity2 , 52 , told the @entity6 court he was innocent today
the @entity22 immigrant had posed as @entity2 , a pretender to the dynasty 's oil fortune
