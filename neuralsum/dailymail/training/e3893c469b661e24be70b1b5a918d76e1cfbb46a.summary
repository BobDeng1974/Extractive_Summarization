by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 have named uncapped batsman @entity3 in their 14 - man squad for the one - off @entity5 against @entity6 at @entity7			1
@entity3 , 24 , gets the call after a breakthrough season at @entity10 , for whom he is the country 's top @entity12 run - scorer with 677 at an average of 48.35 and strike rate of almost 160			1
the @entity17 - born batsman is joined in the squad to face @entity6 next weekend by three other players not currently involved in the @entity21 one - day international series			1
hitting out : @entity3 has been in superb form for @entity10 during this year 's @entity24 blast @entity25 ( captain ) , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ( wkt ) , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity3 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38			1
they are @entity28 , a surprise omission from the @entity41 , seamer @entity29 and @entity42 batsman @entity36			1
@entity25 is again captain , as he was for @entity2 's @entity43 against @entity44 earlier this summer , in the injury - enforced absence of @entity47 - who is set to undergo surgery on his knee this week			1
@entity50 and @entity51 , both involved in the defeat against @entity44 at @entity53 in may , have made way for @entity3 and @entity36			1
the latter has not featured for his country since last september 's @entity41 win over @entity58 in @entity59 but has had a fine season for @entity42 , while former dual @entity61 winner @entity29 last played in @entity2 's embarrassing @entity43 defeat against @entity63 in @entity64 five months ago			1
national selector @entity65 said : ' this one - off @entity66 provides us with an opportunity to look at players who have impressed recently in domestic cricket and gives them a chance to test themselves on the international stage against high - quality opposition			2
' @entity36 's availability depends on the conclusion next saturday , without need for a reserve day , of @entity80 ' @entity79 semi-final against @entity82 at @entity83			2
dynamic : the opener blasted 677 runs in the competition , earning him a first call - up to the @entity2 squad adopted nation : @entity3 was born in @entity91 before then , @entity2 have more pressing issues to address after their second successive odi trouncing by @entity6 at @entity93 on saturday			1
the six - wicket setback , inflicted with seven overs to spare after @entity2 again failed to cope with the travelling spinners , leaves the hosts 2 - 0 down and unable therefore to win the five - match series after an initial washout in @entity101			2
captain @entity102 has been under pressure already from those , including former team - mates @entity105 and @entity107 in their post-retirement roles as pundits , who believe he is not the right man to lead @entity2 to the @entity112 in @entity113 and @entity114 early next year			1
while @entity3 , @entity36 and @entity28 will have the opportunity next sunday to demonstrate they can provide fresh impetus in @entity2 's middle order and therefore even steal into the @entity112 , @entity102 can not stargaze about what may happen next february and march but must concentrate on putting things right in this week 's two remaining odis at @entity7 and @entity122			1
' when you play for @entity2 , you 're under pressure to perform , ' @entity102 said			0
' you keep looking six months , seven months away ... ( but ) we 're very clear in the dressing room that we 're trying to win the next game			0
return : @entity36 's excellent limited overs form has earned him a place back in the @entity2 reckoning ' you can turn it around very quickly , but it starts with individual responsibility			1
' cook himself has gone 37 odi innings , and more than two years , without a century - and collectively , @entity2 have made just four hundreds against @entity137 opposition in 26 matches on their way to defeat in four of their last five series since the start of last summer			2
the captain knows that must change , and is optimistic it will			0
' it will take someone to score that hundred , and everyone will jump on the back of that , ' @entity102 said			0
' you get 330 and you win a game of cricket , and it changes			0
' it would ( just ) take someone like ' @entity157 ' , for example , to suddenly go bang bang and get some 80s			0
he 's that type of player			0
@entity163 : @entity28 's big hitting , clever shotmaking and canny bowling is useful in @entity24 cricket ' but again , probably it 's confidence as a batting unit that we have n't scored the runs in the last couple of games			2
' the only way ( to put it right ) is not looking at anyone else , but the six or seven batters to turn it round themselves			0
' there was minor encouragement for @entity2 in the return at @entity93 of fast bowler @entity31 , so badly out of form last winter and absent from international cricket for almost a year			2
@entity31 has also been selected in the @entity43 squad , and @entity102 senses he is on his way back to peak form			0
' he 's come such a long way from where he was in february , ' @entity102 said			0
' he probably went for a few too many runs [ at @entity188 ] - but as a guy bowling at 86 , 87mph on a slow wicket , he adds a different dimension			0
' you saw the best of @entity31 in @entity114 , and @entity6 once when we were there			0
' if he can get back to that level , he 's a very fine bowler			0

@entity91 - born batsman handed first @entity2 chance
@entity3 has been the top *runscorer* in this year 's @entity24 blast for @entity10
@entity25 will captain the side in the single @entity204
@entity28 was surprisingly dropped from the @entity206 last week
@entity29 and @entity36 also come into the 14 - man squad
@entity50 and @entity51 are left out from previous squad
