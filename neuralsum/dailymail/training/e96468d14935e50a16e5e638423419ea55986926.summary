@entity0 has paid a fascinating and insightful tribute to his family — wife @entity3 and sons @entity5 and @entity6 — after helped him celebrate the milestone of winning his 100th @entity9 cap			1
@entity10 were at @entity11 to see @entity12 join the likes of @entity14 and @entity15 in the exclusive 100 club and he in turn has revealed for the first time the key role they play in his life and career			1
@entity3 , who will turn 30 next year , is a vastly different person from the callow youth who first appeared on television screens chewing gum when he picked up the @entity26 ’s @entity28 award in 2002			1
@entity0 was joined by his two sons @entity5 and @entity6 on the @entity11 turf ahead of @entity9 's qualifier @entity3 , pictured holding younger son @entity6 , has revealed his family have played a major role in his career the 29 - year - old took to @entity36 to state it was ' amazing to walk out ' with his sons he says daily games of football with his two boys in the back garden of their home in @entity44 is the one time he feels he can truly escape the pressures of being @entity0 the superstar			1
and @entity3 , the childhood sweetheart he married in a glittering £ 5million ceremony in @entity48 , remains an important counsel when making the major decisions in his career , including the desire to carry on playing for @entity9 as long as they want him , as @entity15 did			1
@entity3 says that it ’s 18 - month - old @entity6 — named in tribute to boxer @entity56 , who was born @entity56 — who is presently showing more interest in football than five - year - old @entity5			1
‘ i take them out into the garden most days and have a kickabout with the two of them			2
it ’s my youngest lad who wants to stay there longer , he ’s obsessed , ’ says @entity3 with a clear sense of pride			1
‘ they ’re special moments for me because everywhere i go in the world there are photographers or fans coming up			2
‘ once i go to my house – there ’s very few people come to my house and i like that to stay private			2
that ’s where i can be myself , a human being and a father rather than a footballer			2
‘ it would be nice if one of the boys wanted to be a footballer , but i have said before that it ’s down to them and if they want to do it			2
‘ my eldest lad goes to football lessons but at the minute he ’s not too interested in it			2
my youngest lad since the first day he could walk he ’s been wanting a ball			2
he kicks a ball around everywhere he goes so they ’re different characters			0
@entity6 has been practicing his football skills since the moment he could walk , according to the @entity9 captain @entity3 was also at @entity11 to see her husband claim his 100th international cap @entity3 , pictured looking towards @entity5 , was awarded a golden cap by sir @entity101 ‘ i ’ll be honest , i always thought you have to work at it being a footballer but i ’ve now seen my youngest lad , without any teaching his technique is unbelievable			1
so i have started thinking you must be born with something			0
then it ’s obviously how you use it , how you work on it when you get older			0
’ while @entity6 may have inherited the football gene , @entity12 can already see @entity5 developing street - smarts			1
‘ he had his fifth birthday party and we had training and were going to stay at the hotel before the @entity119 game and i could n’t go , ’ says the @entity113 striker			1
‘ he ’s in the same class as @entity123 ’s daughter and i told my lad , “ sorry i ca n’t go , i ’m playing football ”			0
so he was testing me , saying , “ is @entity126 coming ? ” i said , “ no , he ’s at football with @entity12 ”			0
‘ he was testing me so he ’s a lot cleverer than you think ! ’ @entity3 , whom he met at school , is someone he confides in about big decisions			1
after the recent spate of international retirements by @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , @entity3 was interested to see what she thought about prolonging his international career when he approaches his mid-thirties			1
@entity9 duty of course means reduced time with the family			1
‘ i spoke to my wife about it , i said it ’s mad to see all the players are retiring			2
when you get to a certain age , you almost feel like you have to do it to extend your club career			0
@entity135 and @entity136 decided to retire from international football after the @entity156 @entity3 acknowledges the @entity11 crowd before @entity9 's @entity159 qualifier against @entity160 ‘ she was actually very good			1
she was the one who said to me , “ it ’s a short career , you have got plenty of time to have your time off with us as a family when you finish playing and you will regret it if you do ”			1
‘ i obviously thought , “ yes , i would ”			0
football is what i love doing			0
playing for my country i love			0
i do n’t think i would ever walk away			0
’ @entity3 has already targeted the 2018 @entity156 and hopes he will still be good enough to be around for @entity173 when the final will be held at @entity11			1
if he achieves that , his appearance and goalscoring records for his country might take decades to be bettered : 150 caps and 75 goals look realistic targets			0
sir @entity182 always maintained @entity3 would have to work extra hard to stay at the top into his 30s because of his body shape			1
the player accepts he will never have a physique like @entity187 but says it ’s alarmist to think his career will flatline past 30			0
@entity3 celebrates after scoring in the 59th minute against @entity160 on his 100th appearance for his country ‘ i think when i first came into the professional game , a lot of people said my body shape wo n’t allow me to play for that long			1
but in some ways i feel it has helped me , because i am quite strong i have n’t picked up a lot of muscle injuries , ’ he says			0
‘ they are the ones where you have seen players find it difficult to recover and be the same player , those who have hamstring injuries or thigh injuries			0
‘ i had a small injury in my groin last year but other than that all my injuries have been impact or a couple of cuts			0
i feel as fit as ever so i just have to keep working and make sure i am on top of that			0
‘ i do n’t think i am a natural athlete when you look at some of the players ’ physiques			0
but in terms of miles covered in training and on the pitch , i am always at the top so i think it does n’t matter what you look like as a player physically			0
‘ again , i think the next few years will be vital how i look after myself , how i do my training , that will determine how long i play on for			0
’ with @entity10 — wife and boys — alongside him every step of the way .			2
