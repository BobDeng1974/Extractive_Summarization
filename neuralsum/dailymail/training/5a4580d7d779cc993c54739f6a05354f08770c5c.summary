@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all unveiled the so - called ' extreme cleavage ' - dresses or jackets that revealed an enormous expanse of decolletage			1
new mother @entity11 's take on the trend was the most extreme , with the 32 - year - old showing off her @entity23 - like form in a series of risque outfits			1
@entity11 even took to @entity37 to treat her fans to a glimpse of her bust - revealing outfit			1
@entity42 's girlfriend was n't the only star at the party keen to show off their decollete either			0
model - of - the - moment @entity13 also wore a revealing black jumpsuit , complete with a daringly low cut neckline			2
model behaviour : fresh off the catwalk , @entity13 also sported a jumpsuit with a daring neckline at the @entity35 cocktail party held at @entity54 in @entity30 elsewhere in @entity30 , @entity12 proved she had the trend nailed with a sequence of outfits that would have even the most liberal of @entity10 women blush			1
as one of the sexiest models in the world she would turn heads anyway - let alone when sporting the sort of dramatic necklines she stepped out in over the past week			2
at the @entity67 show at @entity5 on monday the 30 - year - old looked confident and stunning in a low - cut white dress which featured a low - cut neckline , dropped - waist and a modest midi - length			1
is @entity12 to blame ? @entity73 was spotted wearing a revealing dress in the @entity10 capital on monday and appears to have sparked a trend across the pond in @entity79 , @entity77 showed her support for the racy look as she stepped out in a black tuxedo jacket while filming an advert in downtown @entity79			1
the 41 - year - old wore the blazer , which was open to the navel , as part of a shoot for @entity90 perfume			0
she wore her blonde hair swept over one shoulder and was topless underneath her blazer aside from a simple gem necklace			0
speaking about the extreme cleavage trend , celebrity stylist @entity96 , said : ' the new trend to show off more cleavage is great provided you have a pert , toned bust , if however your boobs do not defy gravity and require bras of steel to keep them in place do not attempt this trend			2
' if attempting then ensure that you only show the curve of the bust , either in the centre or at the top rather than creating a pushed together ' @entity110 '			0
rocking the trend too : @entity112 wore a blazer , which was open to the navel , as part of a shoot for @entity90 perfume ' look for dresses that will separate and lift the bust so that the look remains classy			2
' invest in strong tit tape - boots stock @entity121 tit tape which is great to keep everything in place			0
' @entity125 , @entity126 deputy editor , added : ' the fashion craze that 's been popping out all over the red carpet ? cleavage			0
' whether you like it or not necklines are cut down to there lately with everyone from serial offender @entity11 to the usually demure @entity112 parading their assets in plunging everything			1
' there 's a fine line between sexy and downright tacky so if you want to carry off a dangerous neckline - and stay in favour with the fash pack - then remember to keep everything else low - keyand simple			0
that means long hemlines , adding a sleek cover - up like a blazer and keeping hair and make - up minimal			0
