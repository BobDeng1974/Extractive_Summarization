by @entity0 , @entity1 editor a supermarket price war is inevitable if the ‘ big four ’ supermarkets are to take on the threat posed by budget rivals , according to a leading @entity8 expert			1
@entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 ’s and @entity12 have been losing market share to the fast growing discount chains , @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity16 , who is responsible for investing billions of pounds of pension funds cash , says they will have to slash prices if they are to stop the loss of customers becoming a stampede			0
the more established @entity24 supermarket chains might be losing out to the super-cheap @entity26 mega-stores , who can offer interesting brands at much lower prices , and have an emphasis on bulk goods ‘ investors know a price war is coming , ’ said mr @entity16 , who is the head of global equities at @entity34			1
@entity37 was a difficult period , particularly for @entity9 and @entity12 , where sales were down on a year ago , which will hit profits			1
by contrast , sales at @entity14 are growing at more than 30per cent a year , while the figure at @entity15 is up by more than 15per cent on the back of a concerted attempt to attract squeezed middle income families			1
both are part of extremely wealthy @entity26 - owned multi-national chains , which have ambitious plans to open hundreds of new stores over the next five years			1
mr @entity16 said the mainstream supermarkets have , to date , ducked the challenge presented by @entity14 and @entity15 , but this will have to change			1
‘ @entity12 , @entity9 , @entity10 and , to some extent , @entity11 ’s are all losing customers at an increasingly rapid pace to the discounters , mainly @entity14 and @entity15 , ’ he said			1
‘ that is simply because of the perception that a shopping at @entity15 and @entity14 is about 20 per cent cheaper for a similar quality			2
they have got to do something about it			0
the perception is that the more established brands are more expensive when it comes to name brands , and do n't offer enough obscure brands ‘ the problem is that @entity12 and @entity9 have not yet had the courage to stand up and fight against the discounters			0
they are ducking the challenge			2
’ @entity12 is understood to be planning to sell the freehold to a number of stores in order to raise money that can be invested in more convenience stores and pushing ahead with the roll - out of its online grocery business			2
@entity10 has recently announced a series of price cuts , with some products reduced to 50p , in a rather tentative effort to respond to the challenge of the budget chains			1
@entity9 has promised to match the reductions of its rivals under its ‘ @entity92 ’ regime , while it has also offered customers savings on petrol			0
but , mr @entity16 suggested a much more radical approach is needed with genuine and deep price cuts that will , initially at least , hit profit margins			0
he said : ‘ if they are relatively expensive – and the customers know it – they need a price reset , or price war , whatever you want to call it , before they can move forward in terms of sales			1
‘ investors know a price war is coming , hence the low rating placed on @entity9 and @entity12 ’ shares			1
‘ it is the pricing that is the problem			0
they have got to reset pricing … to deal with the discounters			0
‘ @entity14 and @entity15 are growing shares at double digit while the majors are losing market share and they have to do something about it			1
’ ( @entity122 ) @entity10 has always touted itself as a cheaper supermarket chain when compared with shops like @entity11 's ( right ) and @entity9 the cost of living squeeze of the past five years , where prices have risen faster than incomes , has led to a permanent change in shopping habits			2
people are buying less food from the mid-range supermarkets			0
many are going to discounters for most items and then buying treats from the likes of @entity139 and @entity140			0
mr @entity16 said : ‘ they ( @entity14 and @entity15 ) are only around 10per cent of the total market , but they are growing at around 20per cent			2
they are significantly cheaper than the competition and they are putting more space down			0
‘ unless , @entity9 and @entity12 deal with @entity14 and @entity15 they will become an increasing threat			2
they are taking market share and they are stopping those companies growing			0
‘ @entity149 is going to be an issue for all the food retailers			0
’ research by retail analysts @entity154 found that over half the population shopped for something in @entity14 or @entity15 ahead of @entity37 , which was a first			1
@entity157 , of @entity154 , told the @entity159 ’s today programme : ‘ the threat of the discounters is very real for the middle ground of the market			0
’ @entity14 has used its success in a series of awards and blind taste testing competitions to promote the theme it is selling high quality food at budget prices			2
it has been able to beat own - label foods from the major supermarkets and even defeat much more expensive luxury products			1
@entity9 ( left ) run the risk of losing business if they ca n't match up to the trends that the @entity26 mega-stores are presenting and even @entity12 ( right ) which was set up as a cheap alternative to the more ' high - market ' branded stores like @entity11 's faces losses for example , its ‘ specially selected @entity188 ’ at £ 1.69 for six – 28p each – were chosen as the best by consumer group which ?			1
a @entity15 product came second			2
both were better than pies sold by @entity192 and @entity193 , which cost eight times more			0
its £ 3.89 @entity194 came top in a blind taste test by the @entity197 , while its @entity198 was runner up			0
both beat the best that @entity192 , @entity202 and the major supermarkets had to offer			2
the ranges at the budget chains have been extended to include dry aged fillet steaks at £ 5 each , together with frozen lobster and caviar			0
both have a very strong reputation for selling high quality wine and spirits			0
the mainstream supermarkets have recently made a stab at undermining the success of @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity10 ’s chief merchandising officer for food , @entity218 , recently said : ‘ with hundreds of products at 50p , we ’re even making the pound shop and @entity14 look expensive			1
’ the @entity11 ’s chief , @entity222 , suggested the budget rivals may be misleading shoppers by highlighting a few premium products and claiming these represent the quality of the whole range .			0
