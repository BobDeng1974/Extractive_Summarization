by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 mayor @entity2 has accused embattled @entity6 governor @entity5 's office of linking @entity8 aid to development and threatening to deny the link if it was made public			1
ms @entity2 told @entity13 's @entity12 that @entity6 liutenant governor @entity14 told her that aid would be withheld if development stalled , that it was a direct message from @entity5 and that any attempts to make the conversation public would be refuted			1
' the lieutenant governor [ @entity14 ] pulled me aside and said , essentially , ' you 've got to move forward with the @entity24 project			0
this project is really important to the governor , ' mayor @entity2 recalled during monday night the interview			2
dirty politics : @entity3 mayor @entity2 is accusing @entity31 's office of linking @entity8 aid to development and threatening to deny the link if it was made public ' i know these things should not be connected , but they are , and if you tell anyone i said they are i will deny it , ' ms @entity2 recalled ms @entity14 saying last may			1
the lieutenant governor was in @entity3 after a series of letters exchanged between ms @entity2 and mr @entity5 that left her under the impression that failing to move forward with the now - infamous @entity24 project would result any chances of @entity8 aid coming to @entity3			1
ms @entity14 held a press conference monday to counter the claims			1
' i deny any suggestion made by mayor @entity2 that there was ever any condition on the release of @entity8 funds by me , ' she said , according to @entity56			2
accused of cronyism : lt. governor @entity14 ( pictured at a 2012 press conference with governor @entity5 in the background ) has been accused by @entity61 of making threats over @entity8 aid and insisting she would deny them if made public she also accused @entity8 aid administrator @entity65 of repeating the threat when she asked him about the aid			1
' mayor , you need to tell us the level of development you ’re willing to do , ' she recalled him telling her			0
when asked why she waited until now to make these accusations public , ms @entity2 said she was afraid it would hurt @entity3 's already dwindling chances of receiving any further aid			1
the revelation the governor 's office said they would deny the conversation ever took place comes after a weekend in which the letters were released to multiple media outlets and it became apparent the probe into alleged corruption is rapidly expanding			2
' as they pursue this investigation , i will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the facts of what happened when the lieutenant governor came to @entity3 and told me that @entity8 aid would be contingent on moving forward with a private development project , ' she said in statement released over the weekend			2
cut off : @entity3 mayor @entity2 claims @entity8 relief money was withheld to try to force her to approve a lucrative redevelopment deal she told @entity13 sunday that it was ' stunning ' and ' outrageous , ' but true , that lieutenant governor @entity14 approached her in a parking lot in may to deliver the threat , stating that it was ' a direct message from the governor			1
' ' i stand by my word , ' she told @entity13 's @entity108			0
@entity110 @entity6 assemblyman @entity109 says he will expand an existing investigation into @entity2 's allegations			0
he 's already investigating traffic jams at the @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity6 , allegedly orchestrated by @entity5 aides as political payback			0
the damning accusations , which @entity5 's administration vehemently denies , came as the governor left his ' bridge-gate ' troubles behind and flew to @entity122 to campaign for a fellow @entity123			1
tough week : governor @entity5 gives the state address on january 14 , as his administration is hit by accusations over ' bridge-gate ' ' the bottom line is , it 's not fair for the governor to hold @entity8 funds hostage for the @entity132 of @entity3 because he wants me to give back to one private developer , ' she told @entity135			1
@entity8 devastated nearly 80 per cent of @entity3 in 2012 , and @entity5 had immediately promised its residents that he would ' be here to help '			2
but when @entity2 requested $ 127million in relief aid , she was given just $ 142,000 to cover the cost of a back up generator , and $ 200,000 in recovery grants from a $ 1.8 million fund , @entity135 reported			2
in a letter written to @entity5 about the low funds , @entity2 wrote : ' please governor , we need your help			1
i have tried to assure @entity3 residents that we would be treated fairly			0
' no written response was received to the letter dated may 8 , 2013 - the same day the city 's planning board rejected a redevelopment recommendation for the @entity156			0
but ms @entity14 supposedly made her remarks to ms @entity2 on may 10 , she told @entity13			0
according to emails , public records and her diary entries , @entity2 claims @entity5 's aides were willing to cut off constituents and use public funds to finance a study for the governor - backed plans			1
the project , a mass redevelopment proposed by the @entity156 , was already in the pipeline when @entity2 was elected as mayor			0
wrecked : huge parts of @entity3 were flooded when @entity8 hit in october 2012 aid : a @entity3 shop tries to run without any power after the storm in 2012 the lucrative deal in a popular commuter area would have given the developers a free rein to build what they wanted while applying for millions of dollars in subsidies			0
@entity2 told @entity135 she was n't against the plan , but she did want an independent study on the projected deal to take place			0
but when the study and @entity3 board rejected the need for redevelopment , much - needed @entity8 relief money was cut off , @entity2 claims			1
then , in a diary entry for may 17 , @entity2 claimed as she was preparing to appear on a televised panel about the @entity8 recovery , commissioner @entity192 leaned in and told her ' everyone in the @entity197 believes you are against [ the @entity24 project ]			2
' @entity2 denied she was against it , but commissioner @entity192 then allegedly told her : ' if you move that forward , the money would start flowing to you			2
' claims : @entity5 with @entity204 commissioner @entity192 , who allegedly leaned on @entity2 to support a project in return for more @entity8 aid ' pressure ' : lieutenant governor @entity14 allegedly told mayor @entity2 if she did n't move forward with the project , the administration would not be able to help her spokesmen for governor @entity5 and community affairs commissioner constable have denied the allegations			1
a spokeswoman for the commissioner said : ' mayor @entity2 's allegation that on may 16 , 2013 , commissioner @entity192 conditioned @entity3 's receipt of @entity8 aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false			1
' the governor 's spokesman , @entity222 , released a statement that read : ' mayor @entity2 has been effusive in her public praise of the @entity226 and the assistance we 've provided in terms of economic development and @entity8 aid			2
' ' what or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone 's guess			0
' when asked by mr @entity12 if the @entity236 was involved in her @entity238 onslaught against the governor , ms @entity2 categorically denied having any contact with the organization			0
' they have n’t called me at all , i have no connection to them , ' she said			0
a spokesman for the @entity247 said : ' we have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation			0
if it turns out to be true it would be deplorable			0
' despite the ' bridge-gate ' scandal , many @entity123 have come to governor @entity5 's defense and praised him for taking action			1
others have said the future of the man who had been tipped to be a presidential contender rests on whether his account of when he learned of the bridge scandal is found to be accurate .			0

@entity2 said she met with the @entity265 for several hours sunday regarding the accusations
she claims she was awarded only $ *320,000* of the $ 127m she requested in hurricane relief funds
@entity3 mayor said she was told more money would come if she backed a lucrative @entity24 redevelopment plan , and that link would be denied if made public
governor @entity5 's office publicly denied the link during a monday *afternoon* press conference
