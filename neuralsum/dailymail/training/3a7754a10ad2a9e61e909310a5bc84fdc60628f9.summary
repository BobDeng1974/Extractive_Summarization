one is the pampered wife of a financially - drained country 's unpopular head of state ... and the other is @entity4 , or so the joke goes			1
but , according to right - wing bloggers , the notional similarities between first lady @entity7 and the hated @entity8 of @entity9 did not go far enough			2
so to stress the point , one website has grafted mrs @entity7 's face on to the famous 1775 portrait by @entity16 @entity15			1
a few tweaks have been made , including exposing one of the president 's wife 's famously toned arms and having her pointing to a location on the globe rather than just resting her hand on top			2
caricature : a right - wing blog site has featured an image of first lady @entity7 as @entity4 and , right , the original 1775 portrait by @entity16 @entity15 - @entity30 above the caricatured image , posted on the @entity33 blog , is the caption : ' choosing the next vacation ' - highlighting criticism that mrs @entity7 's recent trips to @entity38 and @entity39 were tax - funded			1
a similar image has @entity42 's face cut over that of @entity44 , with a caption ' you should be thanking me ' above it			0
that image also appeared last year			0
however , despite the seemingly innocuous historical comparison between one famous @entity51 and another , a row has now erupted over whether the depiction of mrs @entity7 was racist			1
@entity53 , writing for the @entity55 , described mrs @entity7 's caricature as ' baldly racist '			1
he wrote : ' the caricature of @entity7 as a profligate queen relies on the racist stereotype of an " uppity @entity60 " , which emerged among slave masters in an earlier @entity64 era			1
' @entity7 , born into a working - class @entity66 family whose roots are traced to the @entity68 , graduated from @entity69 and @entity70 , prior to holding several high - level positions in the academic and private sectors			2
' ' profligate ? ' : the @entity75 president has also been depicted as @entity44 , husband of @entity4 , with a caption ' you should be thanking me ' blogger @entity79 placed the picture on @entity33 along with a reference to mrs @entity7 's guest appearance on @entity85 sitcom @entity83			1
on the show , she praises the cast for their support of military families and she is mistakenly referred to as ' your excellency ' , to which she jokingly replies : ' i kinda like it			0
' the image is believed to originate from another right - wing website , @entity97 , where it first appeared in 2010			0
the @entity7 has been criticised after taking high - profile holidays abroad which required a heavy security detail			2
in december , she and her husband , along with their children , took a $ 4million vacation on @entity38 which saw large parts of @entity105 cordoned off for security reasons			0
and in 2010 , mrs @entity7 provoked anger in the @entity75 after going on vacation with her two daughters , @entity110 and @entity111 , in @entity39			1
vacation : president @entity7 , the @entity113 and their daughters @entity110 and @entity111 spent @entity116 in @entity38 , with critics attacking the $ 4million cost the @entity75 president came under fire over the preparations for his 50th birthday celebrations - including a private dinner for which couples were charged up to $ 35,800			2
but critics have attacked the @entity55 blog and denied that the doctored image is racist			0
cost : @entity7 took her daughters on holiday to the south of @entity39 in 2010 - a move criticised in the @entity75 because of the cost of the necessary security detail a blog on www.bookwormroom.com said : ' is it possible that you 're unaware of @entity4 's reputation for living extravagantly while the ordinary people around her starved in the street ? ' and are you unable to make the connection between @entity4 's reputation ( and she was @entity143 , by the way , not @entity64 ) and the fact that @entity7 just recently went on a $ 4million tax payer funded vacation , while wearing $ 1,200 sundresses , even as @entity75 have been struggling desperately with unemployment and rising prices ? ' for the informed mind ( or just the living mind ) , the comparisons are inevitable , appropriate and non-racist			1
' the full length painting of @entity4 hangs in the @entity155 , @entity9			2
she became @entity8 of @entity9 and @entity156 in april 1770 when her husband , @entity44 of @entity9 , ascended to the throne			0
the @entity9 people were initially charmed by her beauty , but she was accused of being profligate as the people struggled to eat during the financial hardship of the 1780s			1
she is said to have proclaimed ' @entity164 ' when told that starving peasants had no bread , although historians have found no proof that she actually said this			0
she was executed by guillotine in 1793 after the @entity172 abolished the monarchy			0
her husband also enjoyed initial popularity , but his hesitancy to act on economic downturns and apparent ties to @entity75 saw him lose that appeal			0
his decision to flee with his family to @entity182 undermined his credibility and he was also executed in 1793 .			0
