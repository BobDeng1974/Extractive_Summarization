‘ i cry every time i see that			2
it is all about the vulnerability of the daughter … and it captures the sort of dilemmas of parenting in a teenager			1
’ he went on : ‘ dads are supposed to be a bit embarrassing , but of course you always think to yourself at key moments , “ was that a bit embarrassing ? ” ‘ but actually it ’s sort of what you ’re supposed to do and it ’s always really important to remember that you 're appreciated for being a bit embarrassing , even if it may not feel like it at the time			1

. but ( in the absence of the fab @entity101 ) i 'm voting for @entity102			0
’ x-factor judge @entity107 was taken aback , and asked : ‘ is he really called @entity2 ? ’ before adding : ‘ vote for balls ! ’ he then tweeted @entity107 direct : ‘ hey @ @entity109			0
. thanks for the shout - out			0
’ ‘ it certainly enlivened our sitting room ’ , he jokes , though his children ‘ were appalled ’			0
it is unclear what they make of the fact he seems unable to switch on the tv without breaking down			0

earlier this month he revealed he would appear as a guest drummer for folk - rock band @entity186			0
