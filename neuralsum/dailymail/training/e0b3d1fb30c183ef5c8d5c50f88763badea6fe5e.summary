privacy czar : @entity2 ceo @entity1 unveiled the company 's beefed up technological security wednesday , emphasizing the tech giant 's ' fundamental ' commitment to privacy @entity2 has ramped up its technological security to the point that even the company itself can no longer pry into a password - protected @entity11 or @entity12			1
the additional safeguard is part of @entity2 's latest mobile software , @entity16 8 , which the @entity18 , @entity19 , tech giant released wednesday - two days before @entity11 went on sale nationwide			1
@entity2 unveiled the more robust protection in a new section of its website that is prefaced with a letter from ceo @entity1 who emphasized the company 's ' fundamental ' commitment to privacy and security			2
' our commitment to protecting your privacy comes from a deep respect for our customers , ' @entity1 wrote			0
' we know that your trust does n't come easy			0
that 's why we have and always will work as hard as we can to earn and keep it			0
' @entity2 is highlighting its increased security following a mortifying episode that unfolded earlier this month after hackers broke into the online accounts of @entity44 - winning actress @entity43 , supermodel @entity45 , singer @entity46 and other celebrities who stored copies of nude photos on the company 's @entity51 service			1
nude photos of @entity54 and other female stars were posted on various websites , causing some security experts to question whether @entity2 had taken adequate precautions to thwart hackers trying to break into user accounts			2
since the x-rated photos appeared , @entity2 has been stressing the need for its users to rely on passwords that are difficult to guess			2
@entity2 's inability to unlock password - protected smartphones and tablets could frustrate law enforcement officials who sometimes obtain court orders to vacuum personal data off the phones for potential evidence in criminal investigations			1
the personal information will be blocked on more than just @entity2 's newest mobile devices , the @entity11 and @entity90 , that hit the shelves today			1
that is because @entity2 is giving away @entity16 8 to anyone with devices dating back to 2011			1
the software can be downloaded to devices as old as the @entity97 and the @entity12 2			0
that covers hundreds of millions of devices already in use			0
brand new : the back of an @entity103 gold is shown here at a @entity105 store on september 18 in @entity106 , @entity107 early adopters : hundreds of people lined up friday outside the @entity109 in @entity110 waiting to snap up @entity2 's newest offerings , the @entity11 and @entity90 the number of legal requests that @entity2 gets for personal data off devices is relatively small			1
@entity2 provided some data in nearly 6,500 of the roughly 9,600 requests that law enforcement agencies around the world submitted for devices during the first half of this year , according to the company 's own accounting			2
@entity2 says the requests came in most cases after a device was stolen			2
like other technology companies , @entity2 is trying to present itself as a trustworthy steward of people 's information after former @entity133 contractor @entity131 leaked documents revealing government spies ' efforts to snoop on emails and other personal information as part of an effort to identify potential terrorists			1
@entity2 , like its peers , has lashed out at the @entity145 government 's digital surveillance programs and stressed that it is n't cooperating with any of the spying			0
exposed : the increase in security comes just weeks after hackers broke into the @entity51 accounts of celebrties like @entity43 ( left ) and @entity46 ( right ) and released their nude photos @entity1 is seeking to draw an even bigger distinction between @entity2 and other prominent technology companies such as @entity155 and @entity156 that offer free online services financed by ads that are based on the personal preference expressed in emails that are scanned , search requests that are tracked and social media posts that are analyzed			1
@entity2 has no need to resort to those tactics , @entity1 said , because the company makes its money from the devices and services that it sells			0
' a few years ago , users of internet services began to realize that when an online service is free , you 're not the customer , ' @entity1 wrote in his letter			0
' you 're the product			0
but at @entity2 , we believe a great customer experience should n't come at the expense of your privacy			0

users ' personal information can be blocked not only on the new @entity11 6 , but on any device dating back to 2011
@entity2 recommends adoption of two - step verification that requires a special code to be entered along with a password to log into accounts
