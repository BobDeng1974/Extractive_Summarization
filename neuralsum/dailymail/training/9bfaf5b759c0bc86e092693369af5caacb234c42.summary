by @entity0 @entity1 was recently pictured showing off her bikini body while on a holiday in @entity4			2
the 29 - year - old is proud of the fact she has lost 6st since she won reality tv show @entity7 in 2010 and has reinvented herself as a fitness guru			1
now she 's beaten her own battle with the bulge , she 's on a mission to help others get in shape			1
reformed : @entity1 has lost 6st since taking up exercise and changing her eating habits @entity1 told @entity18 the first step on any weightloss journey is realisation - accepting you are not leading a healthy lifestyle and becoming aware of the impact that can have on your day - to - day activities and self - esteem			1
she explains : ' there were lots of times i wanted to lose weight in the past - i call them " wake up calls "			2
i think at the start of everyone 's weightloss journey it 's important to write your wake up calls down and keep them in sight			2
' my wake up calls were lots of things but mainly the abuse i was getting on @entity46 from people i did n't even know ; the time i could n't do up a pair of knee high boots in plus - size shop @entity51 and the time i could n't do a flying lesson my friends had bought me for my birthday due to my size			1
' the @entity59 - born star said these wake up calls should then become your motivation to change your ways by exercising more and eating less fattening foods			0
@entity1 used to weigh 16st 7lb , left , now she 's a size 8 and wants to help others on their own weightloss journey for those that need a kick start to get in shape , she 's running a number of gi @entity73 ( or more apt @entity75 ) sessions in @entity77 this april			1
participants can book in for a few days midweek , at the weekend or for a full week where they will undertake fitness classes and learn about nutrition			1
' the bootcamp is suitable for women of all shapes , ages and sizes who want to have fun , burn fat and educate themselves on health and fitness			1
you will leave ready to take on the world , ' she said			0
@entity1 , a qualified personal trainer , will lead the sessions which will include military circuits , @entity98 and dance classes			1
she describes the boot camp as a " fitness holiday " where she will pass on the knowledge she has gleaned on how to burn fat through exercise and eating well - without yo - yo dieting			1
work it ! @entity1 leads one of the sessions at her @entity110 boot camp kick start to fitness : @entity1 and the @entity110 team with some previous boot camp participants she said : ' i had tried everything to lose weight			1
all i ever wanted to do was beat my genetics			1
i 've found a way of doing that now and i want to show others the way			2
' changing habits and getting fit is no easy road for a person starting their weight - loss journey			0
the key to everything is educating yourself , setting realistic goal and loving the person you are			0
' she added : ' forget fad diets ! nine out of 10 people on a fad diet will always end up putting weight on again			1
the healthiest way to loose weight is to eat natural and clean foods			0
the environment we live in almost wants us to be sick and fat			0
we need to make a change together so the food industry changes with us			0
@entity1 said she will give talks on nutrition during the boot camp revealing how her knowledge of food has changed , helping her drop from 16st 7lb at her heaviest to a svelte size 8 now , weighing 10st 2lb			1
' i will advise on how i shop for food , eating habits and all the little tips i 've learnt along the way to keep fit and healthy , ' she said			0
' some people think its all about the amount of calories you eat vs the amount of exercise you do , but it 's so much more than that			0
some of my friends eat the same things i once did , but will never put the weight on			0
it boils down to your genetics , what you eat , your environment , how you shop for food , how you feel about yourself , your addictions and all sorts of factors			0
