by @entity0 published : 11:19 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 11:46 est , 31 may 2012 ' good experience ' : thief @entity2 faces jail after missing his community service appointments because he was taking part in the @entity8 show a thief is facing jail after he went on the @entity11 instead of doing his community service			1
@entity2 was convicted last year of stealing a string of items including a toilet seat from a flat in @entity17			1
on november 11 last year , sheriff @entity18 imposed 200 hours of unpaid work in the community as part of a community payback order instead of sending @entity23 to jail			1
but @entity23 - who has previous convictions for cannabis possession and assault to injury - completed only one hour of work between that date and april 10 this year			2
and when asked by social workers why he had n’t done the work he told them he had missed appointments because he had been filming an episode of the @entity11			1
he had gone on the show in a bid to get access to his daughter from a previous relationship			1
despite now facing a period in custody , @entity23 said : ‘ it was a good experience			2
’ @entity23 , 23 , of @entity44 , @entity17 , previously admitted a charge of theft by housebreaking			2
he and another man broke into a flat occupied by @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity17 , between february 11 and 12 last year			1
they stole a television , an xbox console and accessories , ornaments and a train set			2
bizarrely , the pair also stole a toilet seat in the raid			1
in a report submitted to @entity63 outlining the breach of his order , social workers said : ‘ it would appear that mr @entity2 has not afforded his orders due priority which is evidenced by his continued failures to attend			1
‘ his most recent evidence to cover absences was an appearance on tv , namely the @entity11			0
‘ he reports that he now has access to his children which he contributes to his recent appearance on the @entity11			0
‘ there has been no other substantial changes in his circumstances that should preclude him from attending			0
' mr @entity2 again has not afforded his order due priority			1
‘ this despite having been granted extensive periods of time in which to submit evidence			0
' no commitment to order ' : @entity23 said he was a ' really nervous ' during the filming of the @entity11			1
the episode he appears in has not yet aired ‘ even when evidence has been submitted and accepted ’ i have no option but to call in to question his commitment to his order given the most recent evidence used was an appearance on the @entity11			0
‘ i therefore have no alternative but to request that court consider revoking said order in view to imposing an alternative disposal			0
’ @entity23 would have faced a jail sentence when he appeared in court for sentence today , but he failed to attend court at 9.30am			2
sheriff @entity18 granted a warrant for his arrest			0
@entity23 then turned up at court at 10.40am , but was told his case could not be recalled			0
outside court , @entity23 said he had been transported to and from the filming of the show by taxi and had been put up in a hotel by producers			1
he said : ‘ i was n’t that good , i was really nervous			0
it was a good experience though			0
‘ i watch the @entity8 show on the telly , so i thought i ’d phone them			2
‘ i was trying to get access through the lawyers , but i thought i ’d try this instead			0
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity11 said the episode @entity23 was involved in has not yet been aired .			0
