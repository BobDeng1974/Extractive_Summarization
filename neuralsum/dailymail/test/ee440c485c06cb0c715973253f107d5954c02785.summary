@entity1 bosses are investigating after passengers on a @entity4 flight were allowed to walk through a deserted passport control unchecked			1
holidaymakers onboard the delayed flight from @entity8 to @entity1 had been due to land at 11.25pm on friday			1
but by the time they finally arrived three hours later , they disembarked to find an empty arrivals hall at @entity11			1
schoolteacher @entity18 , 46 , told the @entity19 : ' every passenger on that plane walked through without a passport check in @entity23			2
' the only passport check was done at @entity25			0
' my concern is we still have the @entity31 crisis in @entity32 and any one of those people who were coming in via @entity8 could have been travelling from places where potentially @entity31 could have been passed on , ' he added			0
' and also there is the fact that anybody is walking into the country			0
you are told that your taxes go to protecting @entity23 borders			0
' @entity42 claim that a number of passengers were checked by officers on their arrival into @entity1			1
the agency said that anyone not assessed at the airport had been subsequently checked on their systems			0
far from being a one - off , a former airport worker , who would not be named , claimed arriving passengers are frequently unchecked			2
he even claimed that on one occasion , the border agent manning the passport kiosk and making decisions on passenger entry was actually an illegal immigrant			0
holidaymakers were not asked for documents but were allowed to walk through a deserted passport control unchecked schoolteacher @entity18 , 46 , called the lack of security ludicrous and said ' every passenger on that plane walked through without a passport check in @entity23			1
' the only passport check was done at @entity25 ' mr @entity18 , from @entity69 on @entity70 , @entity71 , called the lack of security ' ludicrous			2
' ' if your plane is delayed and it is that time of night and the airport is closed , then you can just walk into the country , anybody , 130 people			0
' nobody was there , no checks were made			0
' ' i did not see a single member of airport staff once we got into the building until we got through to where @entity89 is in the arrivals			0
' i wanted to report to somebody in the airport that there had been this breach of security			2
' @entity1 said it was down to the airline or its handling agent to inform @entity42 of their arrivals			1
but @entity4 said the airline had attempted to update security at the airport of the plane 's arrival at its usual 30 - minute intervals but had been unable to do so due to a malfunction of the airport 's operating systems			1
deserted : passengers are left to make their own way out of the empty terminal at @entity1 mr @entity18 claimed he did not see a ' single member of airport staff ' until he got through to the arrivals lounge a spokesman said : ' all regular operating procedures were followed and the flight times were updated approximately every 30 minutes			1
' there appears to have been a malfunction in the airport 's system , which caused incorrect flight information to be published , and subsequently resulted in this issue at border control			2
we have asked @entity1 to look into this matter and ensure it does not recur			2
' however , the airport said its system ' operated as normal on the night in question			0
' the @entity130 confirmed the @entity131 is investigating the incident but added it was the legal responsibility of the airline or handling company to advise them when inbound flights arrive and to present the passengers to their officers			1
' we are currently carrying out an investigation into this incident , ' a spokesman added			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ' it is the responsibility of an airline 's handling agent to notify @entity42 about arrivals from outside of the @entity23 - not the airport			1
' by them doing this in advance of a flight 's arrival , ensures the relevant @entity42 staff is in place to handle the immigration process			1
' we are continuing to work with our partners to investigate the situation but can confirm the airport 's system operated as normal on the night in question			0
' a @entity1 spokesman said it is the responsibility of the airline 's handling agent to notify @entity42 about arrivals from outside of the @entity23 @entity42 claim that a number of passengers were checked by officers on their arrival into @entity1 ( pictured )			1
