the @entity1 @entity0 tried to pay ransom to win the release of @entity5 sgt. @entity4 from the terrorist @entity6 in @entity7 , but was duped by a con man who ran off with the money , according to a member of @entity11			1
the @entity0 said june 9 that ' there was no money exchanged for @entity4 ’s release , ' and the @entity16 's @entity15 insisted a day later that ' the @entity1 did not provide money in exchange for sgt. @entity4 ’s release			1
' those carefully worded statements do n't appear to rule out the possibility that money was sent but never reached its target			0
@entity24 , the press secretary to @entity26 @entity25 rep. @entity25 , told @entity27 on thursday that the @entity7 holding @entity4 ' wanted to deal			1
they were desperate to deal			0
' official denials from the @entity30 administration , @entity24 said , are par for the course but likely deceptive			1
rep. @entity25 ( center ) is a @entity34 veteran who is pressing the @entity0 for details about a failed plot to ransom @entity4 through a middleman who disappeared with the money a triumphant president @entity30 announced @entity4 's release in may , offering no suggestion that his administration had tried to ransom him before opting for a 5 - to - 1 prisoner swap instead @entity44 ? @entity4 's former platoon - mates said he walked away from his post in @entity47 and should have been court - martialed instead of reintegrated into the military ' we know better than to believe that , ' he explained			1
' that 's what they 're going to say , and that 's fine			0
but where there 's smoke there 's fire			0
' ' they can deny it all they want , ' added @entity24 , speaking of the administration 's official spokespersons			2
' but there are people within the @entity0 itself who are saying otherwise			2
... we know who discussed this issue within the @entity0			2
we know who briefed the secretary			0
' he said the government is in the habit of entertaining ransom plans , but always through third - parties that will give the @entity1 deniability			1
' we do n't pay a ransom in the sense that the @entity1 government officially makes payments to a foreign entity , ' @entity24 said , emphasizing the word ' officially			1
' ' the way we 've been doing this for a long time is through a workaround			0
' rep. @entity25 , a @entity34 veteran who served two combat tours in @entity94 and one in @entity47 after the 9/11 terror attacks , is among @entity98 's most persistent military bloodhounds			1
@entity0 officials flatly told the congressman this year that there was no consideration of a cash swap for @entity4 , @entity24 said			2
' they told him categorically that , no , it never happened			0
that 's when we decided to press down on the accelerator			0
and the information we got back was resounding			0
' @entity16 press secretary @entity110 told reporters on wednesday that the @entity30 administration flatly opposes the idea of paying for the release of @entity1 held captive overseas			1
' it 's not in the best interests of @entity1 citizens to pay ransoms to any organization , let alone a terrorist organization , that is holding an @entity1 hostage , ' he said			1
' and the reason for that is simple : we do n't want to put other @entity1 citizens at even greater risk when they ’re around the globe , and that knowing that terrorist organizations can extract a ransom from the @entity1 if they take a hostage only puts @entity1 citizens at greater risk			1
' @entity25 dropped a bombshell in a nov. 5 letter to defense secretary @entity134 , claiming that @entity1 's @entity135 ' did pursue at least two lines of effort for @entity4 : a kinetic rescue operation , if necessary , and ; a payment to the @entity6 to gain @entity4 's release			1
' ' it has been brought to my attention , ' @entity25 wrote , ' that a payment was made to an @entity47 intermediary who " disappeared " with the money and failed to facilitate @entity4 's release in return			1
the payment was made in january - february 2014			0
' @entity25 also seemed to understand the careful parsing of denials that often follows inquiries – from both congressmen and journalists – into sensitive national security matters			2
' i recognize the reluctance to describe a payment as a ransom , ' he wrote , but claimed the botched payment was made – ' regardless of how the transaction is described			0
' in a separate letter to the directors of the @entity164 , the @entity165 and @entity166 , he expressed his understanding that ' a transfer occurred that possibly included payment to @entity6 from the @entity170 for the receipt of @entity4			1
' accusation : @entity25 's press secretary told @entity27 that defense secretary @entity134 was briefed on the failed ransom plan , which had to involve third parties in order to give the @entity16 deniability @entity177 : the @entity47 released from @entity178 in exchange for @entity4 were among the most senior members of the @entity170 held at the prison camp , including one who had direct ties to @entity184 according to the @entity186 , unnamed officials said the @entity5 ’s elite @entity188 anti-terrorism squad handled the @entity4 ransom mission			1
' the @entity164 also was involved in the ransom payment attempt and was waiting inside @entity47 ’s border with @entity192 when the release failed , ' the @entity186 reported , ' confirming that it had been a scam			1
' the @entity195 makes it a crime to give payment or assistance to terror groups that could boost their support , and hostages ' family members have said publicly that the federal government warned them against raising money for their loved ones ' safe return			0
but retired lt. col. @entity208 told @entity210 radio in @entity211 in june that he had direct knowledge of the negotiating process and was sure the @entity6 had asked for a cash payment			0
@entity4 , he said , ' was never regarded as a – quote – " prisoner of war			0
" they all thought of him as a hostage and that ’s the way they presented it			0
all they wanted was money			0

the self - proclaimed @entity243 , a militant terror group that now controls large sections of @entity245 and @entity94 , has executed three @entity1 hostages this year in gruesome beheading videos distributed via online social media			2
that group has reaped at least $ 20 million this year in hostage ransoms , according to treasury undersecretary @entity251 , but often decides that the propaganda value of videotaped killings outweighs the value of money			0
@entity4 was released in may after the @entity30 administration made a different kind of trade – not for money , but for five high - value @entity170 terrorists who had been held at the @entity178 , @entity260 military detention facility			1
the enlisted soldier came under fire for allegedly deserting his @entity5 unit in @entity47 before he was captured by @entity170 fighters			2

rep. @entity25 mentioned the failed plot in a letter to the defense secretary ; his spokesman says the @entity30 administration is n't *credible*
con man who claimed to represent the @entity7 ' @entity6 ' allegedly fooled @entity0 into paying ransom through a @entity188 unit
' we know who discussed this issue within the @entity0 . we know who briefed the secretary , ' @entity25 's spokesman said
@entity164 agents waiting inside @entity47 reportedly realized the government had been scammed when no hostage - takers showed up with @entity4
but the @entity16 insisted wednesday that @entity1 does n't pay ransoms because it would ' put other @entity1 citizens at even greater risk '
@entity0 's careful statement insists no ransom was ' exchanged for @entity4 ’s release '
