by @entity0 it 's not unusual for a @entity3 couple to escape the rat race by moving to @entity5 - but how about going back 75 years in time as well ? @entity6 and @entity7 have sunk every penny they have into creating their own shrine to the decades either side of the @entity13			1
but it does n't end there , because the self - confessed eccentrics live as if it 's the summer of 1939 , complete with period clothes , furniture and a car all from the era			0
vintage style : @entity7 and @entity6 drive a cream @entity24 in celebration of a bygone era unique time capsule : the couple have re-built a dilapidated riverside hotel in south west @entity5 as it was : @entity32 hotel in south west @entity5 as it first looked blast from the past : @entity6 and @entity7 , pictured in @entity5 , both enjoy dressing in vintage clothes perfect spot : the hotel had been abandoned back in the 1950 's in the beautiful village of @entity39 - en - @entity38 ' i guess they think we 're just that crazy @entity44 couple who run the hotel			1
' it all started in 2002 when stationery salesman @entity6 decided his life was going nowhere			1
he sold his home in @entity49 , @entity50 , and headed for @entity5 where he 'd worked on yachts on the @entity52 as a young man			1
he bought a tumble down farmhouse and set to work , but just a few months later on a trip back to @entity44 he met and fell for @entity7 from @entity58 , @entity59			1
@entity6 said : ' i 'd decided to give up on the rat race , i had a comfortable life as a salesman , but i wanted something different			1
' i was working on my farmhouse which i loved , but i loved @entity7 too			1
luckily she made it easy for me and wanted to be with me in @entity5			1
' the couple found they both shared a passion for all things vintage			2
and , after a six - month - long distance relationship , @entity7 gave up working as a nanny in @entity72 and moved to @entity5			1
they married five years ago			0
stepping back in time : the pair visited vintage events to find authentic items to decorate the hotel ' we never really thought about how we 'd manage , ' @entity7 said			1
' we were young , carefree and in love and had a new and exciting life ahead of us			0
' the couple took seven to complete the renovation on the farmhouse			0
they knew their future lay in @entity5 and they loved their life in their home complete with swimming pool , but something was missing			1
' we needed to find a property we could make into a business so we could support ourselves and live a sustainable life , ' said @entity7			1
then four years ago they saw a dilapidated hotel which had been abandoned back in the 1950 's in the beautiful village of @entity38 in the @entity98			0
@entity7 said : ' it was love at first sight			2
it had been stood empty for four years and was derelict and forlorn			0
' there were holes in the roof , water had been getting in for years and had taken a heavy toll			0
pretty unique : ' there is n't anything like it in the @entity3 where vintage living is more popular ' , says @entity7 ' we quickly realised we 'd spent a large amount of our savings on a pile of rotten timber , collapsed ceilings and mouldy walls ! ' and it soon became apparent the renovation budget we 'd scribbled down over a couple of bottles of wine was total fantasy			1
' work started and for the first couple of years the couple felt like they were ' chipping away at a mountain with a toffee hammer '			2
things ground to a halt when @entity6 was installing a new staircase and he fell , shattering his arm , breaking his nose and a rib			2
despite the setback things eventually took shape and the pair knew what the hotel 's theme would be			0
they 'd visited vintage events in the @entity3 whenever they could and had been hoarding items			0
' but @entity5 was a fantastic hunting ground for furniture and paraphernalia , as were local brocantes , ' said @entity6			1
' we trawled @entity151 for bits and pieces , some of which were perfect and some we got after auctions that ended at midnight			0
it became madness ! ' adding to the experience : the couple have just opened a tea room - and thankfully the bookings are coming in blowing the budget : ' we really did n't want to compromise			0
we wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago ' , says @entity7 @entity7 added : ' we really did n't want to compromise			1
we wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago			0
' we found it really satisfying to put a piece of furniture bought a couple of years before in the place we 'd imagined it would go once we had finished the renovation			2
' now it 's pretty unique thing in @entity5 and there is n't anything like it in the @entity3 where vintage living is more popular			2
' to help the business they 've just opened a tea room too , to add to the whole experience			0
and thankfully the bookings are coming in			0
' if we could go back in time , would we do the same again ? absolutely yes ! ' said @entity7			2
' if we knew how much it would cost , then " no ! " we 'd never have started			0
' but our advice to anyone in similar circumstances is " go for it ! " and if you happen to be installing a new staircase make sure it 's properly secured before you venture up it ! '			0
