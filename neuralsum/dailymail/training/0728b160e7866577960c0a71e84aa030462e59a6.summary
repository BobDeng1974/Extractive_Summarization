by @entity0 published : 08:00 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 11:49 est , 26 september 2013 chaste and holy , catholic priests are supposed to set an example to their communities by forgoing certain pleasures			2
but one community in @entity8 have been left stunned by the resignation their spiritual leader after he was lead into temptation			2
father @entity12 - known as @entity13 , from @entity14 in @entity15 , has voluntarily quit his post after admitting he had got a woman pregnant			1
' @entity35 , who has attended the church for 15 years , told @entity37 : ' he ’s gone after girls before and he ’s gone after my daughters			1
' ' he ’s just lustful , he did n’t say he was in love or marry the girl , no. ' it ’s not about being a sinner , it ’s about playing with @entity48 , he made a vow , this is a priest we ’re talking about			1
' in a letter sent to the church and read to his congregation , @entity13 said : ' a child will soon be born , and i am the baby ’s father			1
i know this comes as a shock to you , and to many a disappointment			0
' i assume full responsibility for my actions and will do all that i can so that my child receives the care and love that he deserves			0
' as @entity66 told the “ @entity68 : ‘ @entity48 makes all things work together for the good of those who love him , who have been called according to his decree , ’ and though the @entity67 never decreed that i sin , he does command that all life be respected and nurtured			0
' @entity19 ' was given an indefinite leave of absence by bishop @entity79 , head of the @entity80 , and will now have to decide if he wants to remain a priest			1
@entity82 , a spokesman for @entity83 , said : ' it is a very very sad thing to happen			0
it is the same as if a married man is unfaithful to his wife			0
@entity88 will have to find a new priest after the sudden resignation on its website the church still lists @entity93 as its pastor ' he made a commitment and he did not stick to it			1
it undermines priests commitment to chastity			0
' priests make their vows for life , so while @entity19 will no longer serve his community , he could serve other communities and continue to perform priestly duties , such as marrying people , unless he volunteers to ' laicise ' himself			1
@entity108 is an official process carried out by @entity110 in @entity111 to effectively ' unmake ' a catholic priest			2
priests do not have to laicise themselves following sexual relations , as with adulterous husbands who may wish to continue being married			0
the process is uncommon , though has peaked in recent times following the @entity83 child abuse scandal .			0

*parishioner* says he was always flirting and had gone after her daughters
father @entity93 made the *announcement* in a letter
it is not known who the mother is or whether @entity19 plans to marry her
will remain a priest unless he volunteers to have powers removed
