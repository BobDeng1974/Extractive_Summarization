@entity0 is being sued in a price - fixing case that could see @entity3 prices fall sharply			1

@entity0 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are accused of conspiring over phone calls , emails and meals in the ' private dining rooms of upscale @entity22 restaurants '			2
the @entity4 is investigating alleged price - fixing by @entity0 and five major publishers : @entity16 , @entity12 , @entity25 's @entity13 , @entity26 and @entity15 the @entity4 claims the alleged price - fixing came in response to @entity30 's aggressive pricing policy , which challenged the industry with a maximum @entity3 price of $ 9.99 ( £ 6 ) , lower than that offered by many of its rivals			1
if the lawsuit is successful , prices on the @entity38 and other e-readers could tumble in the @entity5 and @entity41			0
such a victory would end the deal struck by @entity0 that prevented publishers from selling books via @entity30 or elsewhere at lower prices than they offered on @entity0 's @entity47			1
the arrangement has meant that many ebooks cost the same – or even more than – their paper counterparts			0
@entity0 and the publishers are accused of creating a so - called ' agency model ' of pricing , under which they dictate the price of an ebook as long as they give 30 per cent of the revenue to the retailer			1
book prices on @entity30 's kindle and other e-readers could tumble after a deal in a major price - fixing case is reportedly ' close ' the agency model , set up when @entity0 launched its @entity66 in 2010 and since widely adopted , was seen as an attempt to ease @entity30 's grip on the digital market			1
previously , retailers set the price of @entity3 themselves – but many sacrificed their profit margin to win market share			0
this lowered customers ' expectations of how much an @entity3 should cost			0
it also rattled publishers , who viewed ebooks as a way of propping up their overall profits			2
a spokesman for the @entity4 said : ' publishers saw the rise on ebooks , and particularly @entity30 's price discounting , as a substantial challenge to their traditional business model			1
' [ they ] feared that lower retail prices for ebooks might lead eventually to lower wholesale prices for @entity3 [ and ] lower prices for print books			2
' to combat this , they ' teamed up with @entity0 , which shared the same goal of restraining retail price competition ' , they added			1
the @entity103 is already investigating alleged price - fixing in the ebook market			1
@entity106 , an analyst at @entity107 , said victory for the @entity4 ' would be a positive for @entity30 because the company 's greatest strength is as a high - volume , low - price retailer and the wholesale model plays into that '			1
@entity30 's @entity115 : the internet retailer has been left unable to discount ebooks after a deal between @entity0 and publishers @entity0 did a deal with publishers two years ago which led to retailers such as @entity30 being unable to discount books to lower prices than @entity47 late @entity0 co-founder @entity125 reportedly did not want @entity0 's ibook store to compete with @entity30 's cheap prices , and helped broker the deal between publishers			1
the @entity103 is investigating claims that @entity0 and five publishing houses worked together to keep @entity3 prices artificially high			1
it is also suggested that the arrangement killed competition by ensuring that @entity0 ’s rivals , such as @entity30 and @entity135 , could not undercut its prices			1
in the @entity41 , the government is partly to blame for the high cost			0
the @entity139 has sanctioned an anomaly in the tax system which means @entity142 is charged at 20 per cent on ebooks , but is not applied to real books			0

in the @entity41 , the government is partly to blame for the high cost of ebooks			0
the @entity139 has sanctioned an anomaly in the tax system which means @entity142 is charged at 20 per cent on ebooks , but is not applied at all to ' real ' books			0
the boom in @entity3 is a goldmine for publishers and technology firms , as distribution costs are a fraction of those involved in printing , transporting and selling books			0

@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity16 have settled the claims but @entity14 and @entity15 still face litigation			0
@entity15 said the @entity4 's settlement terms ' were too onerous ' and denied the company acted illegally			2
a @entity14 spokesman said : ' a responsible company does not choose a path of litigation with @entity5 government agencies without carefully weighing the implications of that course of action			0
we have done nothing wrong [ and ] we believe that the agency model is the one that offers consumers the prospect of an open and competitive market for ebooks			0
