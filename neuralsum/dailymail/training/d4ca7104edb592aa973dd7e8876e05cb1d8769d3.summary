by @entity0 if you 've ever played with @entity2 , you 'll know the frustration of hitting the ' throttle ' too hard and sending the cars veering off the track			1
in what 's been dubbed ' @entity2 for the 21st century ' , a new game attempts to solve this problem by keeping cars on track using sensors and cameras			1
and in an even more modern twist , the cars are controlled by an app meaning racers can throw virtual weapons , obstacles and even stop their opponents , as seen in games such as @entity22 's @entity21			2
the game blurs the line between video and toy games , enabling players to race round on a ' roll - able ' track that uses smart technology to ensure the cars stay within lines on the surface called @entity24 , players control physical cars on a ‘ smart track ’ with an @entity46 or @entity47 and use virtual power - ups to beat opponents			1
up to four players can race cars around the tracks , or players can go it alone and battle against the artificial intelligence , built into the cars			1
@entity24 is available now for £ 179.99 ( $ 199.95 ) and comes with two cars , while each additional car costs an extra £ 49.99 ( $ 69.95 )			1
within each car is a small camera that let them ‘ see ’ where they are going			2
this camera points straight down and looks through the track into the circuitry underneath			2
the track itself provides information for the car as to where it can drive			2
a 50 megahertz computer on each car monitors where it is on the track 500 times every second			2
this then feeds information to the motors in the two rear wheels so the car knows where to drive			0
every two milliseconds they make an adjustment to the rear motors to stay on trajectory			0
according to chief executive and co-founder @entity99 , ‘ if you scaled it up to real - world size it would be equivalent to driving down a highway at 250 miles ( 400 kilometres ) per hour with a concrete wall a tenth of an inch from your windows , and staying within that wall			2
' the track itself , about the size of a tabletop , can be rolled out onto any surface , and the matchbox - sized cars are then placed on the track and controlled by players using their chosen device			1
this is done via a free app for @entity112 that syncs devices with the cars - and the company told @entity116 there are also plans to eventually bring the technology to @entity119			2
each car automatically follows the racing lines of the track			2
using their chosen device , players can then speed up and slow down their car , turn from side - to - side , or use a variety of virtual power ups			1
on the screen of the app are various input mechanisms to play the game , ranging from a ' throttle ' for speed and power - ups to be used during a race			1
there are two game modes - @entity138 , which sees players attempt to ‘ destroy ’ each other on the track , or a standard race mode to a set number of laps			1
players are also given access to ‘ weapons ’ such as a virtual rail gun that they can fire at other cars while on the track			1
disabling another car will make it stop moving until it recovers , allowing others to drive past			0
up to four players can race around the track using one of several uniquely programmed cars ( pictured )			1
each of the cars have different attributes ; some are faster and more agile , while others have access to better virtual weapons that could be used to disable the cars of other players a number of other power - ups , including a boost function and the ability to reverse a car around on track , lets players either avoid attacks or speed to victory			1
and each car is also programmed uniquely , with some being more accustomed to battles and others better suited to speed			0
as races and battles are completed , players additionally get access to upgrades that can be applied to their car			0
and if a gamer upgrades their own car , they can take it to a friend 's house and use it on their track with the upgrades intact			0
@entity24 bears many similarities to @entity2 tracks of old , but with a new twist that uses modern technologies to provide a new way to play			0
the game was designed by graduates from @entity199 in @entity200			0
the track can be rolled out onto a flat surface on which the cars can then race			1
for now this is one of two tracks available , but the company say it is possible much larger tracks could be released in future			0
for example , they say a large track unfolded in the kitchen at their office was able to host 128 cars at one time @entity218 ( stock image shown ) is a slot - car toy racing game created by @entity221 and now owned by @entity222			1
it was released back in 1957 and sees players use a controller with a throttle to alter the speed of cars on track as they followed rails around and race each other ‘ we found this technology fascinating and capable of doing amazing things , ’ chief executive and co-founder @entity233 told @entity116			1
‘ we wanted to apply it to commercial products			0
‘ so we started with a game where we wanted to bridge the worlds of toys and video games			0
’ @entity233 explains how the game , while simple at its heart , can be mastered by more experienced players to give entirely new experiences			0
the mechanics are simple and easy to teach , he says , meaning anyone can pick up and play			0
‘ 5 year - olds love it , 40 year - olds love it , 80 year - olds love it , ’ he continued			0
‘ people love being able to have this level of competition in physical form that ’s never existed outside the screen			0
‘ the family gaming aspect is something that ’s very appealing			0
’ the company also hinted there may be opportunities to apply the same technology used in the cars to future games - such as miniature robots fighting it out in a ' smart arena ' .			1

@entity27 firm has *unveiled* a game that blurs virtual and real worlds
called @entity24 , it lets gamers control matchbox - sized cars with @entity46
the cars are placed upon a rollable ' smart track ' that fits on any surface
at the bottom of each car is a camera that ' sees ' where they are going
up to four gamers can race against each other in battle or race modes
