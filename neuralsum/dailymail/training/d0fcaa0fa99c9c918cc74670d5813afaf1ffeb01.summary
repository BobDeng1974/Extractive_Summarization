while they have helped thousands find both long - term love and short term flings , dating apps have created almost as many problems as they have solved			2
from a constant barrage of seedy messages ( and pictures ) from shady characters , to meeting up with people who clearly took their picture when @entity11 were still in the charts , navigating your way through the world of dating apps can leave you feeling rather sour			2
but a new app , created by two women , promises to put an end to these dating woes by putting women in control of the dating scene			1
two @entity25 graduates have invented a dating app called @entity27 that makes women invisible until they decide to make a move			1
they can also use the app to locate a hot man geographically @entity27 allows women to remain anonymous , entirely unseen by the men in their vicinity until they choose to contact them			1
women can look at the profiles of men near their location and decide who is their type while staying completely invisible			1
this means they can avoid both creeps and wasting time talking to people who you will never ' click ' with			0
the woman can then initiate contact by either ' tapping ' a man , or start messaging him , at which point he can see her profile and location			0
as well as being linked to a person 's @entity52 account , members on @entity27 must also submit a time - stamped verified profile picture to ensure that people actually look similar to how they present themselves			0
avoiding time - wasting is also a big selling point of @entity27 , as messages are deleted after just 24 hours			0

the app is the brainchild of @entity25 graduates @entity65 , 33 , and @entity66 , 34 , who first met at senior school in south @entity68			1
speaking to @entity69 , @entity65 said : ' we were single when we started work on the app - it was before @entity73 and so online dating was really big on places like match.com			1
' we really thought at the time that online dating could be a more fun experience for people than it was , we wanted to do something that was less of a pain			2
' i think anyone who has dabbled in online dating has experienced the dates where you meet them and they look at least four years older than their photo			0

' @entity66 added that the anonymity feature is also a huge plus for both women and men			1
she said : ' we imported one of the key features from @entity115 that shows where people on the app are in @entity68			0
except only the women can see the men			2
' so , if a girl can see there are loads of hot guys in @entity124 , then they can go and meet them there			0
' it 's bringing it back to the basics again			0

@entity65 , 33 , and @entity66 , 34 , invented a dating app
the site makes women invisible until they decide to make a move
it can also be uses to locate *attractive* men
