she is the former star of @entity1 who broke the rules by shunning fake tan , false eyelashes and skimpy body - con dresses in favour of a more natural and demure look			1
and now , after a sell - out summer collection , tv star - turned - fashion - designer @entity9 is channelling her love of retro fashion in yet another clothing range			1
taking inspiration from the vintage style she wears so well , @entity9 has crafted the eponymous autumn / winter 13 collection using a nod to her love of timeless , feminine designs with a subtle , sexy twist			1
she 's back ! @entity9 has unveiled her third clothing collection and she says it 's her best yet ( @entity24 dress , £ 75 ) speaking about the creation of her third collection , the 22 - year - old said : ' the inspiration behind this collection remains very similar			1
' i still wanted my pieces to have the same influences and tell the same story			2
the collection is very vintage inspired , glamorous , sophisticated and timeless			1
' i have taken inspiration from my favourite 1950s @entity37 style icons like @entity38 and @entity39			1
' along with watching all my favourite designers on the catwalk showcasing their a / w ranges and picking up new trends			2
' demure : @entity9 says that she wants her clothes to exude sexiness without being too revealing ( @entity46 , £ 70 , @entity47 , £ 50 ) vintage : evolving the brand 's signature aesthetic , the new collection combines iconic vintage silhouettes with playful , feminine detailing ( l - @entity53 £ 50 , @entity54 , £ 80 ) her first 10 - piece capsule collection was a fashion hit so she extended her range into a 25 - piece collection for spring and incorporated a lot more colour			1
she explained : ' this collection is my first autumn / winter range so i could experiment with a darker colour palette			2
i have chosen a rich berry , blood red , deep navy , soft greys and of course the staple black			0
' i feel like this collection is my best to date as i really feel my clothes have a real identity now and a signature look			2
' i now have a real understanding of my bestsellers and customer feedback so i believe this range has something for everyone			0
' @entity83 nice : @entity9 's signature crochet detailing and unique ribbon ties have been recreated in a variety of rich berry shades for autumn ( @entity88 £ 75 ) dressing up : a staple for the @entity9 collection , the midi - dress returns for @entity92 , updated for the new season in an array of statement colours ( l - @entity96 , £ 80 , @entity97 , £ 70 ) unlike many of her former co-stars and @entity101 friends , @entity9 has shunned the classic @entity103 look for a much more demure style - favouring vintage designs over figure - hugging bodycon dresses - and her new collection reflects this			1
she said : ' looking sexy i believe does n't mean showing as much as possible			0
looking sexy is about being confident and wearing something that leaves men lusting for more			0
' a dress should bring attention to your best assets			0
that is why i have designed dresses for all shapes and sizes			0
but they should not show every asset			0
this i believe always attracts the wrong attention			0
' speaking about the pieces she like best from the new collection , she said : ' i have three drops for a / @entity129 and i have a favourite piece in every drop			2
' it 's hard to pick just one , but my i like pieces that sit off the shoulder			0
' personal favourite : @entity9 , who designed the whole collection from start to finish , loves the £ 75 off - the - shoulder @entity141 dress ' it 's such a classic look and so hard to find dresses that sit on the shoulder comfortably			1
my favourite from the first drop is the @entity141			0
' @entity9 was born into a fashion - mad family - her mother @entity148 was a fashion buyer and her aunt was a designer - so it came as no surprise to the @entity153 clan when @entity9 ventured into the world of fashion			1
the budding fashionista and her sister @entity157 were even honoured with a prestigious @entity159 award for the @entity161 fashion retailers for their @entity103 boutique , @entity163			0
speaking about her success , @entity9 said : ' i feel i have grown as a designer as i now have a really good knowledge about the whole process			1
monochrome : elegant pencil skirts and ladylike button up blouses complete the new @entity9 collection ( l - @entity173 £ 50 , @entity174 , £ 75 ) ' from mood boards , drawing sketches , learning about the different qualities of fabrics , @entity179 , grading and buying meetings			1
i now have a lot more confidence with all these procedures and will carrying on learning more and more as each new collection evolves			2
' i am still in love with my designing even when i have a break in between each collection i find myself cutting snippets from magazines and popping into vintage stores for inspiration			1
i am so grateful of the platform i have been given to launch me into the fashion industry			0
' and after such a successful foray into the world of fashion , the future is most certainly looking bright for the young starlet - and she is loving every minute			2
fashionista : @entity9 advises : ' simply pair with chic courts and a slick of red lipstick for @entity204 inspired boardroom - to - bar style ' this year , she will start her designs for spring / summer 14 and hopes to move into other areas of designing like footwear and accessories			1
she is also soon to start a @entity211 summer tour of her store @entity163 where she will be opening seven pop - up shops around the @entity211 in @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220			0
