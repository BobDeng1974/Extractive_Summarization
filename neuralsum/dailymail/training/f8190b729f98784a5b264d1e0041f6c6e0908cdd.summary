by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 03:09 est , 11 july 2013 pensions minister @entity1 said younger people will have the advantages of knowing they will get a simple , clear state pension the under - 30s will be forced to spend their careers saving up for retirement because their state pensions will be far lower than expected , experts warn today			1
the @entity10 , which examined government plans for a flat - rate pension to replace the current system , says ministers must spell out the difference so people can save into work or private schemes			1
from april 2016 , all pensioners who have worked for a minimum of 35 years will be entitled to £ 146 a week , compared with the current £ 100.15 - a - week basic state pension and means - tested add - ons			1
as well as making pensions simpler and cheaper , ministers say most of those retiring in coming years will be better off under the new system , particularly low earners			0
in a report , the @entity10 agrees that of people reaching pension age between 2016 and 2020 , 61 per cent will get more under the new rules , and 17 per cent the same amount as now			1
but in the long run , those born after the mid- 1980s will see a significant reduction in state pension income ‘ for almost everyone ’ of up to £ 2,300 a year			1
it calls on the government to make it clear to young people that they will need to build up their own savings if they want the level of retirement pay their parents receive			0
the new ‘ single - tier ’ pension scheme cuts the link between pensions and earnings			2
the winners will be women who have taken time off work to have children , who stand to gain £ 9 a week ; low earners , who will gain £ 3.97 a week , and the self - employed			0
losing out are mostly higher earners			0
the @entity10 said the reforms will reduce the cost of the pension system as a whole and help the public finances cope with an ageing population			2
but the authors say younger people , almost all of those born after 1986 and many born after 1966 , will be far worse off when they retire in real terms			0
someone born in 1986 who spends 35 years as a low earner would receive nearly £ 1,000 per year less under the proposed new system than under the current system			2
in the long run , those born after the mid- 1980s will see a significant reduction in state pension income ¿ for almost everyone ¿ a higher earner of the same age could lose £ 2,300 a year , the @entity10 says			1
@entity81 , one of the report ’s authors , said : ‘ people born from the mid-eighties onwards will certainly be negatively affected			2
‘ this is essentially because £ 146 a week in today ’s money increasing in line with wages is below what most young people today will expect to earn , unless they are very long - term self - employed			0
the messaging around these reforms should be making that clear			0
‘ on the upside , the flat rate is much clearer so they will know exactly how much they will get from the state and plan around it			0
but they will need to save privately to earn as much as under the current scheme			0
’ pensions minister @entity1 said : ‘ the majority of individuals approaching retirement will see a higher state pension			1
' younger people will have the advantages of knowing they will get a simple , clear state pension , and when they are employed have the right to an occupational pension on top			1

the @entity10 says ministers must spell out the difference so people can save into work or private schemes
@entity10 agrees 61 per cent of people reaching pension age between 2016 and 2020 will get more under the new rules
but those born after the mid- 1980s will see a significant reduction in state pension income ‘ for almost everyone ’ of up to £ 2,300 a year
