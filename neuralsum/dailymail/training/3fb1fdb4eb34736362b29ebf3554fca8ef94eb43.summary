it does n't mean people do n't , but i do n't			0

questions and answers have been edited for clarity and length			0
q. what did you find most surprising ? a. we thought the actors would be their own camera person originally , but it 's just a lot for them to have to get everything framed just right			2
we quickly devised a method where a camera person held the phone just in front of them			0
so that it did n't look like the phone was floating in space , we always had an actor put their hand on the cameraman 's hand			2
that made it look like they were doing a selfie thing			0
@entity218 how does the @entity43 compare with traditional cameras ? @entity247 when you have a controlled environment , it 's easy to get nice - looking images			1
the challenge comes when you 're dealing with extremes â€” extreme brightness and darkness			0
the cameras we typically use cost tens of thousands of dollars and use lenses that cost just as much			0
you 're going to always get a better quality with those			0
but the phone 's quality is quite good			2
it 's just amazing what 's happened to smartphones in five years			2
@entity218 could you have achieved the same effect with professional cameras ? a. we wanted it to look as real as possible , so rather than shoot it on this incredible camera and then dumb the image down a bit so it looks like an @entity43 , why not just shoot it with an @entity43 ? this is certainly good enough for our purposes , and it made the most sense			1
@entity218 where do you see this going , not just with iphones but other consumer gadgets such as @entity284 video cameras and digital slrs ? @entity247 it opens up filmmaking to people who do n't have the resources for expensive equipment			2
there 's a movie at the @entity293 this year that was shot on an @entity43			1
you really can , if you wanted to , shoot a movie on an @entity43 or a thousand - dollar camera and then edit it on your computer			1
if you 're clever enough , it can look like an expensive movie			0
that said , filmmaking is not just about having the technology and the camera			0
it 's also about having a vision and the story			2
that 's always going to rely on good old - fashioned human ingenuity			2
@entity218 how do you avoid making the equipment the center of the attention ? a. the really compelling part here is the story telling , not so much how we did it technologically			0
at the end of the day , this story needed to be told this way			0
it 's an emotional story , and it 's a funny story			0
ultimately when you have that going for you , it keeps this from becoming a gimmick			0
while the @entity43 thing is a nice headline , i hope ultimately people remember this as a compelling episode			1
q. there are lots of @entity334 and @entity335 users out there			0
do you worry about criticism that you are focusing too much on @entity29 ? @entity338 is the way my family communicates			1
we happen to be an @entity29 family			1
this is the technology that i know			0
if @entity89 started contacting everybody through @entity91 , it would have felt less believable to me because i do n't know anybody who uses it that way			0
it does n't mean people do n't , but i do n't			0
it just so happens that i use @entity29 , so it 's the way that makes sense for me			1
( after producers reached out to @entity29 , the company provided devices , but did n't pay for their inclusion			2
) q. any tips for budding filmmakers ? @entity247 using this kind of technology is nothing but a means to an end			0
the more important thing is to spend time on the story and the characters and make sure you have something compelling that 's worth actually using these devices for			0
if you do n't , it 's very easy to come up with beautiful images and fun camera tricks			0
the real difficult part is to have something worth filming			0
that 's where you should put the bulk of your time and energy			0
