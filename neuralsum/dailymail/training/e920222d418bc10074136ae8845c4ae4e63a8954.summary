you can lead a lion cub to water , and even make it drink ... just do n't try to make it jump across , as this patient lioness learned the hard way			1
the mother lion tried to make her five youngsters cross a river where a freshly - killed topi was waiting to be eaten in @entity13 's @entity12 last month			1
wildlife photographer and @entity16 guide @entity14 arrived just as the scaredy cats were preparing to cross			1
but the cubs were less than impressed and resolutely remained on the bank , refusing to budge			2
@entity14 explains : ' this particular morning in october we had an early start from @entity72 in the @entity73 to search for the fabled marsh lions			1
' it took a while to find them but finally we spotted a couple of females feasting on a very fresh topi kill			2
the only problem was the five cubs were on the wrong side of a stream			2
' the adults were clearly uncomfortable about this and made several attempts to entice them over but it was chilly that morning and clearly the water did not look lovely to the cubs			0
finally : finally after yet another airborne example from their mother , the two youngest cubs leapt over easy peasy : at first it looked like they were going to clear the stream with ease splash : but they fell short by a matter of inches , splashing down in the cold water made it ! they were wet but alive and made it to the other side where their dinner was waiting tasty : moments later they were tucking in to the topi on the other side tasty : once they had had their fill , she gave them a bath to clean off the mud from the stream cheeky : and after they were fed , the cheeky youngsters found time to mess about before their mother brought an abrupt end to the fun ' the whole adventure took almost 30 minutes , there was no - one else there except my three @entity72 land cruisers and the show was incredible			1
' time and time again the mothers leapt over the stream with @entity59 grace only to fail in their persuasion			0
' they coaxed , they cajoled , they flattered and they even tried picking up their charges but to no avail			1
it was very endearing to hear the cub 's cries of anguish and trepidation			0
' finally after yet another airborne example the two youngest leapt over , getting pretty damp in the process			1
the mothers then went back for the other three older cubs			0
' finally , they all cleared the river and with stomachs calling tucked into breakfast			2
i abhor humanising animals and dislike cheesy interpretations of animal behaviour , particularly on tv , but that morning you really had to feel for mum			0
' it was a very special half hour which i am unlikely to forget in a while			0
fortunately one of my clients @entity160 was filming , we both had big smiles at the end of the water jumps			0
' @entity14 's annual @entity166 charity lecture is at the @entity167 in @entity168 on november 24th			1

the adorable scenes were captured by photographer @entity14 in @entity13 's @entity12 last month
the mother leads five cubs to the edge of the river and shows them how to jump across ... to no avail
she appears to try everything from cajoling to picking them up , but they still will not dare risk getting wet
finally the two youngest give it a go and fall short by a matter of inches , getting soaked in the process
