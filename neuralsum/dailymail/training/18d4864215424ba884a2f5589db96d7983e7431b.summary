by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor published : 08:22 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 13:36 est , 20 march 2013 millions of @entity4 's hard - pressed taxpayers will find themselves up to £ 705 better off after the coalition today delivered on its flagship tax cut a year early			1
chancellor @entity8 announced that the amount of money that workers can earn before they start paying tax will be raised to £ 10,000 from april next year			1
that will take another 700,000 people out of tax altogether			0
ministers had promised to deliver the key @entity17 policy before the 2015 election , but the cut has been rushed forward by a year			0
the personal allowance will already increase from £ 8,105 to £ 9,400 on april 1			1
the announcement means that from april 2014 the average taxpayer will pay £ 705 less income tax than before the 2010 general election			1
ministers boast that the cash is the equivalent of the average gas bill or for two people to pay their council tax bill			2
the @entity17 claim that the move will mean 24million taxpayers will have been given an income tax cut since 2010			0
it means a total of 2.7million people will pay no income tax at all			0
is @entity8 's @entity50 for @entity4 ? @entity51 , the @entity17 chief secretary to the treasury , said : ' when times are as tough as they are now , our focus must be on helping those on low and middle incomes			2
' the right to earn £ 10,000 income tax free has gone from the front page of our manifesto to the pockets of 27m hardworking people			1
by keeping this promise we are giving practical help to millions of families			0
' critics have complained that the money fails to compensate for other tax rises , including mr @entity8 ’s early decision to hike vat from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent			1
when the coalition was formed , the @entity71 and @entity17 pledged to ‘ further increase the personal allowance to £ 10,000 , making real terms steps each year towards meeting this as a longer term policy objective ’			1
going up : when the income tax threshold reaches £ 10,000 in april 2014 , the average worker will be £ 700 better off than in 2010 the government promised to ‘ prioritise ’ the policy over other tax cuts , including the @entity83 policy to cut @entity84			1
the tax - free threshold in 2010 was £ 6,475 , rising to £ 7,475 a year later and then £ 8,105 last year			1
mr @entity8 had already announced that the threshold is due to rise again to £ 9,400 in april this year , 12 months earlier than expected			1
the allowance previously only rose in line with inflation or rises in wages			0
each £ 100 increase in the personal allowance , above inflation , costs the exchequer £ 500million			2
but free market think thank the @entity96 urged mr @entity8 to lift the allowance to £ 12,875 , which would ensure full - time minimum wage workers would not have to pay any tax			1
it said in a report last year that a £ 12,875 personal allowance would increase the take - home pay of all those earning less than £ 100,000 by £ 575 and lift up to 1,297,000 people out of the tax system			1
the institute ’s policy director @entity108 said : ‘ it is a national scandal that we tax the people at the bottom of society so much that they ca n’t earn enough to achieve a basic standard of living			0
’ payments : from april 2014 the average taxpayer will pay £ 705 less tax than before the 2010 general election meanwhile hopes were also pinned on the chancellor easing the strain on savers today as well as building on recent signs of confidence returning to the housing market			1
savers have seen the returns on their cash squashed by four years of ultra-low interest rates as living costs remain high and wages are stagnant			2
almost a dozen tax loopholes will be closed overnight as the government clamps down on those who scrimp on payments to the exchequer			2
as the chancellor strives to plug @entity4 ’s £ 32bn tax gap , he unveiled ‘ the largest ever package to tackle tax evasion ’			2
the host of measures is expected to bring in £ 4.6bn to @entity146 ’ coffers over the next five years			1
some ten loopholes will be shut down by the government , @entity8 announced			2
tax specialists who concoct artificial avoidance schemes will be ‘ named and shamed ’ under proposals outlined in the budget			2
this is part of the attempts to ‘ tackle both the supply and demand of these schemes , ’ the document said			0
‘ a tax system where people and business pay the taxes expected of them is the glue that holds society together , ’ the chancellor declared			0
mps previously lambasted @entity167 corporate giants @entity166 , @entity168 and @entity169 for scrimping on payments			0
anyone , either a company or individual , who used a tax avoidance scheme in the past will also have to tell the taxman how much they saved by it – and pay it back			1
this could raise up to £ 130m over five years			2
one measure will see @entity180 , @entity181 and the @entity182 enter into discussions with the government over @entity4 with assets on the islands to settle up with the taxman over past dues			0
an estimated £ 8.5bn of funds are held on the islands by @entity4 residents , and the government hopes to claw back £ 325m a year by 2016 from the measure			0
according to financial information website @entity197 , the impact of inflation on savings means that £ 10,000 invested five years ago , allowing for average interest and tax at 20 per cent , would have the spending power of just £ 8,884 today			1
former government policy adviser @entity202 , who recently stepped down as director - general of @entity204 , said that the rules around tax - free @entity206 should be relaxed , so that people can invest all of their allowance in cash isas if they want to			1
under the current system , only half of the £ 11,280 allowance for this tax year can be saved in cash and the remainder must be invested in stocks and shares			1
dr @entity202 said : ‘ older people who need to live on their savings can not afford to gamble on the stock market , nor can younger generations who are saving for a house deposit			0
‘ it is important , especially given the dramatic drop in savings interest rates , that the government helps savers and allows them the choice of whether to invest in cash or other assets freely			0
’ mr @entity8 could also today signal that corporation tax will be cut to 20 per cent			2
he has already slashed the headline rate from 28 to 24 per cent and it is due to fall to 23 per cent next month and 21 per cent in april 2014			0
but he is understood to be keen to reduce corporation tax to 20 per cent – aligning it with the basic rate of income tax and the tax rate on small companies			0
it comes as a new study showed the @entity4 has enjoyed a jobs ‘ boom ’ despite the economic downturn and huge cutbacks in public spending , despite a fall in labour productivity and a squeeze on pay			0
leading analyst the @entity253 said 2012 was the best year for employment growth since 2000 , with previous jobs booms taking place during periods of a strong economy			0
director dr @entity260 said : ’ 2012 really was a year of extraordinarily strong employment growth			0
a jobs boom without economic growth is unprecedented in recent @entity4 economic history			0
’ budget day : chancellor @entity8 has announced that the amount of money that workers can earn before they start paying tax will be raised to £ 10,000 from april next year			1

personal tax allowance will already rise from £ 8,105 to £ 9,400 on april 1
chancellor @entity8 will now bring forward £ 10,000 allowance to 2014
@entity96 : £ 12,875 would pull minimum wage staff out of tax
*ex-policy* adviser says all @entity281 allowance should be allowed to go in cash
@entity8 closes tax avoidance loopholes to raise £ 4.6bn over five years
