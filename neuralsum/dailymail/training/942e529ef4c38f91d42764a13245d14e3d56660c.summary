by @entity0 a @entity2 couple made an unusual discovery when they renovated their living room - a gravestone			1
@entity7 was digging up the floor his lounge in @entity10 , near @entity11 , southern @entity2 , when his shovel hit something , quite literally , rock solid			1
the headstone is well preserved and fully legible , and carries the names of two men and one woman who died in the mid- 1800s			1
grave find : the 6ft 7in headstone was found by @entity7 while he was renovating his lounge , and carries the names of two men and one woman who lived on their farm in the mid- 1800s mr @entity7 is a carpenter and has spent the past few years renovating the family home , and made his discovery working on a room in the former farm - hand ’s quarters			1
when digging underneath the floorboards in the living room , he uncovered the gravestone			2
‘ i was digging away to get a bit further down when my shovel hit something hard , ’ @entity7 told @entity33			0
‘ when i kept going and cleared away the dirt around it , i thought “ it ’s a bloody gravestone ” ’			2
it is nearly 6ft7in long and four inches thick and carries three names and death dates			0
mystery solved : the headstone is thought to have been moved from a nearby church when the graveyard was rebuilt in 1904 ( stock image ) @entity48 , who died 1843 , @entity49 , who died in 1851 , and then ‘ their spouse ’ @entity52 , who died in 1884 , aged 68			1
‘ i suspect @entity52 was married to @entity48 and then @entity55 , ’ says @entity7 ’s wife @entity54			0
all three lived on ‘ @entity56 ’ , the same farm property that @entity7 and mrs @entity49 now live in			0
however , the farm - hands quarter where the stone was found was not built until more than a decade after the death of @entity52			2
local priest @entity61 ’s theory is that the stone was removed from the grave after a new church was built in 1904 and so the family of @entity66 took the stone and put it under the floor			1
mrs @entity49 has since tried to track down information about @entity52 and her supposed husbands			0
mr @entity7 plans to dig up the stone this weekend and move it into the garden .			0

names of one woman and two men still fully legible on the stone
local priest *believes* it was moved from local graveyard in 1904
