by @entity0 ministers have asked to hold controversial court cases behind closed doors five times in the past year – and been given permission for at least three			1
the cases involve a terror suspect suing the government over alleged torture , @entity7 shipping officials suspected of transporting nuclear material , and an @entity14 mole suing @entity15			1
powers for judges to allow evidence to be heard in private , in civil cases involving national security , were pushed through @entity21 last year despite strong opposition			1
the @entity24 facade of the @entity25 in @entity26 : five controversial lawsuits will be heard in secret in the first report on how the power had been used , justice secretary @entity29 revealed ministers had made five applications for the ‘ closed material procedure ’ in the year to june 24			1
the report said two applications had been granted , but it is known that a third was also allowed at the start of this month			0
the other two are yet to be decided			0
a government spokesman said the figures showed the power created under the @entity43 had been used ‘ sparingly ’			2
but campaigners say the government is simply trying to avoid embarrassment after high - profile cases such as the @entity49 detainees who sought damages for alleged torture			1
in one case , home secretary @entity52 won a top judge ’s permission to use secret court hearings to defend a damages claim brought by @entity14 mole @entity58 , a former @entity60 officer			0
he was suing @entity15 for breach of contract and negligence in the way he was treated following a shooting by the @entity14 which left him unable to work			0
he claims the security services failed to provide care for post-traumatic stress disorder and access to disability benefits			0
mr @entity73 said ‘ sensitive material ’ relating to the protection and the training of security service ‘ handlers ’ arose in the case which could not be heard in public			0

@entity97 , of the legal charity @entity98 , said : ‘ the government ’s case for their expansion of secret courts is just as misleading as it always was			2
‘ the reality is that there were already measures in place to allow national security - sensitive material to be dealt with safely			0
‘ the closed material procedure – which allows the government to use evidence against you which you can not even see – was always more about avoiding state embarrassment than ensuring justice is done			2
’ a @entity116 spokesman said : ‘ the government believes that closed material procedures are the right way to enable civil cases involving national security material which the courts recognise is too sensitive to disclose			1
‘ previously these cases had been unable to proceed – meaning no final judgment from a court , none of the questions posed by the claimant answered , and the government forced to spend taxpayers ’ money to settle claims without being able to put across their case			2
’ the @entity81 has long campaigned to expose the risk to democracy and openness from secret courts – including closed family courts , super-injunctions and civil cases involving national security .			1
