half full or half empty ? the answer could predict a person 's risk of heart disease and early death we 're told to always look on the bright side of life - and now it seems there 's a good reason why			2
people with a positive outlook on life are twice as likely to have healthier hearts and circulation , researchers claim			1
not only that , optimists take better care of themselves			2
compared to their more negative counterparts , they had significantly better blood sugar , healthier cholesterol readings and were more physically active			1
they were also more likely to have a healthier body mass index and less likely to smoke			2
the researchers , from the @entity26 , suggested boosting people 's mental well being could help tackle poor health			1
a person is at risk of heart disease if they have high blood pressure , smoke , have high blood cholesterol , are diabetic , do not exercise , are overweight or obese or have a family history of heart disease			1
@entity39 , professor of social work , said : ' individuals with the highest levels of optimism have twice the odds of being in ideal cardiovascular health compared to their more pessimistic counterparts			1
' this association remains significant , even after adjusting for socio - demographic characteristics and poor mental health			0
' the study published in the journal @entity51 and @entity52 was the first to examine associations between optimism and heart health in more than 5,000 @entity58 adults			2
their heart health was measured and scored as poor , intermediate and ideal			0
the scoring was based on their blood pressure , body mass index , blood sugar readings , cholesterol levels , diet , physical activity and whether they used tobacco			1
they were also quizzed on their outlook on life and physical health , with researchers asking if they suffered from arthritis , liver and kidney disease			1
people who were the most optimistic were 50 and 76 per cent more likely to have total health scores in the intermediate or ideal ranges , respectively			2
the association between optimism and cardiovascular health was even stronger when socio - demographic characteristics such as age , race and ethnicity , income and education status were factored in			0
people who were the most optimistic were twice as likely to have ideal heart health , and 55 per cent more likely to have a total health score in the intermediate range			0
professor @entity97 said : ' at the population level , even this moderate difference in cardiovascular health translates into a significant reduction in death rates			0
' the study backs up previous findings about the health benefits of being an optimist			0
those who with a positive outlook on life are twice as likely to have healthier hearts and circulation , researchers claim			1
not only did optimists have a more positive outlook , they took better care of themselves researchers at @entity117 found women who were optimistic were 14 per cent less likely to die from any cause than pessimists			1
they were also 30 per cent less likely to die from heart disease after eight years of follow up in the study			0
optimists also were also less likely to have high blood pressure , diabetes or smoke cigarettes			0
but do n't overdo it : one researcher believes a ' realistic sense of optimism ' is key			0
@entity131 , an organisational psychology researcher at @entity132 , claims people with this mindset are more likely to be happy and successful than those who are pessimistic or wildly optimistic			0
a realistic optimist is defined as someone who looks on the bright side of life but has a realistic grasp on the present and what to expect in life			0
she said realistic optimists use their realism to perform well at work and in exams , while their positive outlook enables them to dodge periods of depression and helps them spot opportunities .			1

those with a positive outlook on life twice as likely to have healthier hearts
these people also took better care of themselves , say @entity58 researchers
compared to their more negative counterparts , had better blood sugar readings , healthier cholesterol levels and were more physically active
