the devastated wife of a former professional footballer who is battling @entity2 ’s believes he may have developed the disease after repeatedly heading a ball			1
former @entity6 captain @entity5 , 72 , who was known for his tough tackling was diagnosed with the condition in 2007			1
his wife @entity9 , 68 , was recently forced to put him into residential care because she was no longer able to look after him at their home in @entity13 near @entity14 , @entity15			1
@entity5 in his @entity6 heyday : his wife believes that repeatedly heading the ball has lead to his alzheimer 's disease diagnosis she now believed that heading the ball during his 23 - year playing career as a central defender contributed to his @entity2 ’s			1
mrs @entity24 said : ' i do not think heading footballs helped			1
he used to head medicine balls in training because if you could head one of those , you could head a football further - that is like being punched			1
@entity24 faced the devastating decision of moving her husband @entity35 to a care home earlier this month heading the ball : @entity5 has moved into a @entity14 care home ' @entity35 had been playing since he was a kid and i do n’t think he played with the really heavy leather balls with laces , but they were heavier than the ones they play with today			1
' the authorities would never admit it because it would open the floodgates , but i think there are a lot of ex professional players with @entity2 ’s			0
' @entity51 was born in @entity52 , started his career at @entity54 and played for @entity6 for 13 years , making 295 appearances and scoring ten goals between 1968 and 1981			1
the father - of - two and grandfather of five was then a member of the club ’s commercial staff for seven years and chief scout for another 13 years until he retired in 2001			1
mrs @entity24 said he started showing signs of the disease eight - years - ago when he became forgetful although his doctor said at first it simply down to him getting older			1
she realised something was seriously wrong when he could not remember who @entity6 had played two days earlier six - years - ago			1
mrs @entity24 said : ' it was a monday morning and @entity6 had played on the saturday			1
i ca n’t remember if it was at home or away and @entity35 did not know they had played			2
' when he was young he would read the four divisions scores and he could tell anyone the scores after reading them once			0
this time he did not know that @entity6 had played at all			1
' mrs @entity24 said she did not immediately tell friends about her husband ’s condition because of the stigma surrounding dementia , and also told how she initially found it difficult to get the help and support she needed			2
she said : ' there was no back - up and i felt i had been cast adrift in a sea and i found that i had to find things out for myself			0
@entity6 and @entity91 football legend @entity5 ' at first i struggled along and when we met people in the city , i prompted him about football , but eventually i had to tell people about the @entity2			1
because of the stigma surrounding dementia , i did not tell people to start with , but it is not his fault			0
' @entity35 did not realise what @entity2 ’s was			0
even if we saw a programme on television about it , he did not relate that it was the same thing he was going through			0
' the last three years got really bad and we started doing less and less			2
' she added : ' up until five years ago we went on holiday to see our son in @entity110 and we stopped going to @entity91 18 months ago because we had a problem on the plane and he wanted to get off before the plane stopped			2
' i stopped taking him to the football about two years ago because it was difficult and at half time he thought it was finished			2
he sometimes watches the games and he can still kick a ball about , but can not turn around when the ball goes behind him			2
' this week , in a bid to help others in her situation , mrs @entity24 opened a new @entity126 shop and advice centre in @entity14			0
she hopes that it will encourage dementia sufferers and their carers to receive more support , but says that the decision to put her husband in a care home ten days ago was extremely difficult			1
she said : ' some days he is better , but he has gone downhill since last @entity136			0
' i think he knows who i am , but i do not know if he knows who his sons are			0
' she added : ' he can not hold a conversation			0
in the care home he still goes up to people and shakes people ’s hands and is still friendly and he was always a people person			1
there is still a little bit there			0
' he was not a smoker and was not a big drinker and kept himself fit and healthy			0
if someone like him can get @entity2 ’s it could happen to anyone			0
' over the past 30 years , research has linked moderate and severe traumatic brain injury to a greater risk of developing alzheimer 's disease or another type of dementia years after the original head injury			2
emerging evidence suggests that repeated mild traumatic brain injuries , such as those that can occur in sports like football and hockey , may be linked to a greater risk of a type of dementia called chronic traumatic encephalopathy			0
research has shown that boxers have an increased risk of chronic traumatic			0
it is not known exactly what causes this process to begin , but people with alzheimer 's disease have been found to have abnormal amounts of protein and fibres in the brain			0
known risk factors in the development of the condition are old age , family history , head injuries or whiplash and vascular disease			2
an inquest in 2002 heard how former @entity193 and @entity195 striker @entity194 ( above ) died aged 59 from dementia brought on by repeatedly heading the ball			1
a coroner ruled that his death was industrial as the heavy leather balls which he played with in the 1960s had caused him trauma similar to that suffered by a boxer			0
