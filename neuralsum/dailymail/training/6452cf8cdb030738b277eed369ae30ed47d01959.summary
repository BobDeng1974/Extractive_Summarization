@entity0 was diplomacy personified after his final @entity3 derby , even saying he would miss playing at @entity4			1
on the evidence of last night 's game , it should n't take him more than a couple of weeks of @entity10 sunshine to get over any pangs of nostalgia			0
just over a year ago , @entity13 and @entity14 were both in the top - five when they clashed at @entity4 and produced a thrilling 3 - 3 draw that was a candidate for match of the season			1
@entity13 captain @entity0 ( left ) watches on as his acrobatic effort is blocked in their 0 - 0 draw with local rivals @entity14 @entity0 ( left ) was making his 33rd and final appearance in the @entity26 derby on saturday evening at @entity4 @entity13 legend @entity0 ( left ) is leaving the club at the end of the season where he will be joining @entity31 side @entity30 @entity14 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity32 7 ; @entity33 7 , stones 7 , @entity34 7 , @entity35 6.5 ; @entity36 6 , @entity37 5.5 , @entity38 7.5 ( @entity39 86 ) ; @entity40 6 ( @entity41 60 , 6 ) @entity42 6.5 ( @entity43 85 ) , @entity44 6			1
subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 booked : @entity36 , @entity35 , @entity42 , @entity50 @entity13 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity51 7 ; can 7 , @entity52 8 , @entity53 6.5 ; @entity54 7.5 , @entity55 5 ( @entity56 16 , 6 ) , @entity0 6 , @entity57 6 ; @entity58 8.5 , @entity59 6 ( @entity60 82 ) , @entity61 6 ( @entity62 55 , 6 )			1
subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 booked : @entity54 referee : @entity69 ( @entity70 ) @entity71 man : @entity58 click here for all the stats and heat maps - including @entity0 's ( above ) - from @entity4 since then , both clubs have gone a little off the boil , or a lot off the boil in @entity14 's case , and this game reflected that			1
there was plenty of running , desire and defensive organisation but little in the way of thrills and creativity			0
the exceptions were @entity0 who twice came close to scoring a fairytale winner and , at the other end of the age scale , 19 - year - old winger @entity58 who struck the post in the first half			1
as for @entity14 , for a home side to wait until the 86th minute to register a shot on target in a derby is almost unthinkable			1
no wonder @entity101 , whose glass is always half full , preferred to concentrate on a clean sheet that made it six games unbeaten , though they remain stuck in mid-table for the time being			1
@entity109 was upbeat afterwards after his gamble on giving @entity58 only his second start in a red shirt paid off			2
fit - again striker @entity62 ( centre ) was named among the @entity13 substitutes for saturday 's evening @entity26 derby @entity14 's deadline day loan signing @entity41 ( left ) was included on the bench for their clash against bitter rivals @entity13 all the eyes were on @entity13 captain @entity0 ( right ) before the game - in what was his final @entity3 @entity26 derby @entity13 teenager @entity58 ( right ) was handed only his second @entity3 start in the 224th @entity26 derby @entity58 was joined in attack by @entity128 regular @entity59 ( right ) - who is pictured running at @entity14 captain @entity34 during the game @entity0 ( left ) came close to giving his side a dream start but saw his free - kick tipped over by @entity14 goalkeeper @entity32 the youngster came closest to breaking the deadlock when he ran past two @entity14 defenders before planting a 25 - yard shot against the upright			1
' i thought it would creep in , ' he admitted shyly after collecting his man - of - the - match award			0
' i thought over the course of the game we were clearly the better team , he said			0
' the balance was very good			0
we pressed , we looked exiting and were a threat going forward			0
we switched off in the last five minutes and they had a counter attack but that was their first shot on target			2
' i had been waiting to bring @entity58 into the team			2
we felt he could contribute , it is why we brought him back from loan at @entity157 and i had no qualms about putting him in for this game			0
' so often has @entity0 written his own scripts – not least against @entity14 with 10 goals in 32 previous derbies – it was almost a surprise when his first - half free - kick was clawed away by @entity32 , and when an acrobatic overhead kick cannoned off the head of @entity42 and went wide			1
typically , he preferred to concentrate on @entity58 afterwards rather than wallow in his own farewell			2
' it was a sensational performance , he only knew on friday he 'd be playing , ' said @entity0			0
' he was man of the match			0
' @entity170 were n't happy with the 5.30pm kick off time but it meant the floodlights were on at the start and added to a crackling atmosphere			0
the first contentious decision , a @entity42 barge on @entity53 , was met with a cacophony of howls and we seemed all set for rip - roaring contest			0
unfortunately , it became clear fairly quickly that neither team feel confident enough at the moment to take their foot off the pedal and go for it			0
@entity14 were happy to see their midfield “ dog of war ” @entity36 back after six weeks absence and built their team around him			2
@entity13 looked a more cohesive unit with @entity59 and @entity61 pinging first - time passes around but the @entity0 free - kick apart , they had little to show for it in front of goal			2
@entity13 playmaker @entity61 ( right ) tries to evade the challenge of @entity14 midfielder @entity36 @entity13 were dealt with an early blow when midfielder @entity55 ( right ) pulled up with an injury as a manager , @entity101 loved it and he and @entity109 were constantly issuing instructions to their players			1
' tactically it was fascinating , with two asymetric shapes , ' said the @entity14 boss			2
unfortunately for everyone else , there was n't enough going on in the penalty areas to make it exciting			0
@entity13 kept @entity44 quiet with defender @entity213 described as a “ @entity214 ” by @entity109			2
when @entity62 came on for @entity13 after 55 minutes , he did n't get a real sniff of goal			1
there was n't even much genuine aggro flying about			0
@entity54 and @entity42 were booked for dishing out verbals to each other late on and @entity40 stormed away after being substituted but it was handbags stuff			0
@entity55 ( left ) had to be helped off the pitch as he could n't continue playing saturday 's @entity3 encounter perhaps there were n't enough @entity226 on the pitch who knew how much the fixture meant ; just @entity0 until @entity60 and @entity43 came on as late substitutes			1
@entity14 's local left - back @entity231 has an injured knee			1
@entity0 tried a scissors kick that was goalbound til it hit @entity42 and then at the end , @entity14 belatedly had a late flurry			1
@entity43 played in @entity33 and his rising shot produced a flying save by @entity51			0
a point for @entity13 keeps them four points off a @entity242 spot			2
@entity14 's only chance of qualifying for @entity244 rests with winning the @entity245 , a competition where they could meet their @entity26 rivals again			1
meanwhile , @entity0 's farewell tour continues before he hits @entity30			0
with each passing week , he must feel he 's made the right decision			0
@entity128 boss @entity109 ( right ) was forced into making an early substitution with @entity251 ( centre right ) replacing @entity55 the red half of @entity26 came close to taking the lead when @entity58 ( left ) was denied a tap - in by @entity14 goalkeeper @entity32 @entity213 ( left ) and @entity42 battle for the ball down the touchline during the match at @entity4 @entity42 ( left ) was involved in a nasty - looking incident after challenging for an aerial ball with @entity56 the @entity263 international ( left ) fell awkwardly on his head after competing for a header with @entity56 @entity42 laid stricken on the floor but managed to continue playing for the @entity14 on saturday evening @entity109 ( centre right ) barks out instructions to @entity128 skipper @entity0 during a pause in play in the first half @entity58 ( second right ) came closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half when his thunderous right - footed shot hit the post @entity36 ( centre left ) received the first booking of the match midway through the first half for a bad tackle on @entity61 @entity62 underwent a warm - up during the half - time interval as @entity13 sought a goal against their local rivals former @entity285 team - mates @entity41 ( left ) and @entity0 shake hands before the resumption of the first half as @entity13 started the brighter in the second half , @entity0 nearly opened the deadlock with a brilliant acrobatic effort @entity128 forward @entity62 ( centre ) did n't have to wait too long to come on in the second half as he replaced @entity61 ( left ) in the 56th minute @entity41 ( centre ) made his first appearance as an @entity14 player replacing forward @entity40 on 59 minutes one of @entity41 's ( left ) first involvements as an @entity14 player is to challenge @entity59 for the ball @entity14 boss @entity101 ( left ) and his @entity13 counterpart @entity109 watch proceedings unfold as both side push for a winner the one flash point of the match came when @entity50 ( top ) fouled @entity58 in the closing stages of the second half @entity50 's challenge saw @entity42 ( left ) and @entity54 ( centre right ) having to be separated as they argued the quarreling duo were both booked for their actions as both sets of players got involved with the heated argument @entity50 ( right ) was also cautioned by referee @entity69 who quickly diffused the matter after it started to boil over @entity0 ( right ) nearly came close to winning the match for @entity13 in the dying moments but saw his left - footed shot curl wide @entity33 ( right ) brought out a save from @entity128 ' goalkeeper @entity51 ( left ) late on , in what was the @entity14 only shot on target @entity0 ( centre ) applauds the travelling @entity13 supporters that made the short journey to @entity4 after the full - time whistle			1

@entity58 came close to breaking the deadlock on 26 minutes when his thunderous shot hit the post
@entity41 made his @entity14 debut as a second half substitute following his loan move from @entity340
result sees @entity13 remain *7th* and @entity14 12th in the @entity3 table
