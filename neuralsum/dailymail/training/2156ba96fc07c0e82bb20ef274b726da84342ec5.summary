but following the war , and although dogged by post-traumatic stress disorder , @entity1 began a new career documenting some of the leading lights of the art world			0
a leading light of the 1950 ’s art set , @entity1 ’s post-war career produced some of the most iconic images of artists such as @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 available today			1
but the new images display an altogether softer side of her personality , and show why the celebrated war photographer ’s home became such a @entity68 for artists during the 50s and 60s			1

set up by @entity1 ’s only son , @entity105 to preserve and collate her work , in the wake of her death in 1977 , many of the photos contained in the archive can now be seen online , thanks to @entity33 ’s newly relaunched website which includes a library containing 3,000 of @entity1 ’s works			1
more of her work can be seen at @entity71 , where the photographer spent her later years and launched her third career – this time as a gourmet cook			0
the house , and @entity1 ’s beloved herb garden , is to be opened to the public every sunday between april and october			0
