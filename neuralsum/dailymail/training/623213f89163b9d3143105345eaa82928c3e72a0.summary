the blogger who was jailed and sentenced to 1,000 lashes for ' insulting @entity2 ' was given new hope last night , when it emerged that @entity5 's king would refer his case to the country 's supreme court			1
the @entity5 government has not made an official statement regarding @entity12 's freedom , but his wife says the king 's intervention came before he received the first 50 lashes last friday			1
in an interview with the @entity20 , @entity18 said : ' now his case has been passed by the royal office to the @entity22 , he hopes something will happen soon , perhaps next week			1
' she had accused the government of killing her husband week by week - as the second round of his punishment was postponed due to ' health reasons '			1
the country was accused of ' utter brutality ' and ' outrageous inhumanity ' yesterday after it interrupted the father of three 's flogging sentence - so his wounds could heal before he was whipped again			1
mr @entity12 is being flogged 50 times every friday for supposedly insulting religious figures and undermining the regime - a charge he and his wife @entity18 strenuously deny			1
the first 50 of the lashes were inflicted in front of hundreds in the main square in @entity47 last week - and the same was due to happen again today , and for the next 18 weeks , until all 1,000 have been completed			1
already , the horrendous toll being taken on his body is clear			0
@entity74 today said the government was not allowed to go ahead with the punishment			0
for @entity18 , almost 6,000 miles away in @entity78 , it is too much to bear			2
speaking to the @entity80 , she said : ' @entity5 is endangering his health and life â€“ if they go through with the whole 1,000 lashes , they are killing him more every week			1
' it is a criminal act			0
' @entity18 and the couple 's three children , @entity64 , 11 , @entity65 , 10 , and @entity66 , seven , have been living in a small town in @entity90 since november 2011			1
they fled @entity5 when @entity12 was arrested , spending two years living in @entity92 before being granted refugee status			1
it means - although they are safe - none of them have seen @entity12 for more than four years and , since he was moved to a new prison two - and - a - half weeks ago , no one has spoken to him either			1
however , @entity18 , 35 , did have friends in the square last friday - including @entity12 's sister			1
' she unfortunately witnessed the flogging , ' @entity18 said			2
' she was there to try and support her brother			0
' he was very strong - he was silent during the flogging			2
' but the advent of technology means @entity18 has also been able to see what happened to her husband			2
shocking footage of @entity112 being whipped in the square is available online , filmed secretly			0
just as those present reported , @entity12 stands strong , and quietly , while two guards dole out the punishment , and the crowds jeer			2
@entity18 is still shocked it has come to this : she knew her husband wrote a blog called @entity121 , but never thought it would draw the attentions of the authorities like it did			2
he was arrested in june 2012 - although it had been expected for a while , as the government had blocked his bank accounts and banned him from leaving the country in 2009			0
at first , he was accused of apostasy - or renouncing @entity2 , a charge which , if found guilty , would have meant beheading			2
but it was thrown out by @entity135 's high court , and @entity12 was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes after being found guilty by an anti-terrorism court of ' undermining the regime and officials , ' '' inciting public opinion ' and ' insulting the judiciary '			1
' criminal act ' : @entity12 's wife , @entity18 ( pictured ) , told @entity80 : ' @entity5 is endangering his health and life ' @entity12 and @entity18 in happier times together , while they were both still living in @entity5 escape : @entity12 's daughter @entity64 ( left ) , 11 , and son @entity151 ( right ) , 10 , fled @entity5 when he was arrested it was upped to 10 years and 1,000 lashes after he appealed the sentence			1
' i was surprised , because i never thought it would go this far , ' @entity18 said			2
' what he is has been accused of is not true			0
he did not insult the religion and @entity2 or any member of the government			0
' the blog was only about social change and human rights			1
' he did not do anything wrong - he is a prisoner of conscience			0
' yet on thursday the @entity5 government confirmed this week 's flogging would go ahead in the @entity47 square , which has earned the grisly nickname ' @entity170 ' as the site of executions			2
in all the time of @entity12 's imprisonment , @entity18 worked to shield her children from the reality of her husband 's situation			1
but when they knew the floggings were due to go ahead , she realised she would have to tell them			0
' they only knew their daddy was in prison , they did n't know he was sentenced to flogging , ' she said			2
@entity12 has n't seen his three young children for four years , ever since they fled @entity5 ' the school and i decided that we had to tell the kids - without going into detail			1
' i wish i did n't have to tell them			0
they cried and do n't understand			0
' they are not normal kids anymore			0
' but @entity18 , who married @entity12 in 2002 , still hopes international pressure will make the @entity5 government stop the punishment			1
@entity12 has many supporters in the international community , including the backing of @entity205 - one of the first groups @entity18 contacted when she arrived in @entity90			1
' this case has so many violations of human rights , ' said @entity205 's @entity211 , who has become a close friend of @entity18 over the past two years			1
' he is a prisoner of conscience			0
it is a question of freedom of speech			0
' protests against @entity12 's treatment at the hands of the @entity5 government have been taking place all over the world - including this one outside the country 's embassy in @entity223 yesterday @entity205 is calling on government 's around the world to condemn the floggings amnesty around the world is calling on governments to intervene on behalf of @entity12 , and the other victims of torture in @entity5			1
' @entity5 is a country which uses torture in a systematic way			2
it is unfortunately a champion of the death penalty , ' said @entity211 , who also noted the irony of @entity5 sending a representative to the @entity240 march in support of freedom of speech			0
@entity18 is now learning @entity243 and settling into her new country			0
it is , she says , ' impossible ' to ever return to @entity5			0
' they are acting in a criminal way , and i can not have respect for a country which does not respect freedom of speech			0
' and she is clinging onto the belief her husband will one day join her in @entity90			0
' i will see him again , for sure , for sure , for sure			0
i will never give up hope and i am sure @entity5 will stop what they are doing and release him , ' she said			0
