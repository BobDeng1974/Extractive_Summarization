by @entity0 follow @ @ mattylawless for @entity4 , becoming the first @entity2 winner of the @entity3 in 46 years was just one of the great outcomes from his stunning seven - shot success back in 1970			1
the second was the friendship that blossomed with the man who presided over his bag for those four golden days at @entity13			2
‘ one of the sweetest things of it all was the $ 3,000 that i gave my caddie , @entity18 ’ , said @entity14			1
backing : golf legend @entity4 has backed @entity19 to defend his @entity3 title @entity21 : @entity22 won his first major at @entity24 last year throwback : he was the first @entity26 to do so since @entity14 himself in 1970 ‘ yes , i did leave my cheque in my trousers and it went off to the dry cleaners			1
‘ but they sent me a new one and i gave @entity18 10 per cent of my $ 30,000 winnings			2
it put him through college			2
‘ he was 19 at the time			2
he went on to become a multi-millionaire who owned golf courses and sports bars and all sorts			2
and even at 63 , he remembered every shot i hit			2
‘ so , apart from winning the @entity3 , the nicest thing is that @entity18 made a fantastic success of his life too			1
’ sadly , @entity18 passed away during his sleep at his @entity45 home at the end of last month			2
this year ’s edition at @entity48 will no doubt prove an emotional time for legend @entity14 , @entity51 ’s most - celebrated @entity50 captain of all - time , with reminders of his sensational triumph and the man who was there alongside him			1
‘ he ’ll be missed by a lot of people , ’ the 1969 @entity3 champion recently told @entity57 in a telephone interview , just two weeks after speaking exclusively to @entity59 at the @entity61 golf day at @entity62 in @entity63			1
‘ @entity18 touched a lot of lives and was a sweetheart of a guy			2
’ hordes : @entity14 is mobbed by fans after victory over the @entity45 in the @entity50 at @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity45 , in 1987			1
having won two majors and three @entity76 , @entity14 is royalty in @entity2 golfing terms			1
and he was delighted to see @entity19 end a long , 43 - year wait and add his name to the coveted list of winners when he triumphed so spectacularly at @entity24 12 months ago			1
‘ i was thrilled for @entity19			2
i know the feeling and it had been a long time ( since an @entity26 player won it )			1
‘ it was a long time before i won it and a long time after , so it was really great			2
he ’s a great guy and i was delighted for him			0
he held it together beautifully			0
’ so does @entity14 believe @entity22 , 33 , will go one better than he managed and successfully defend his title come sunday evening ? ‘ it ’s a tough championship to defend , ’ he said			1
‘ there ’s expectation and everyone ’s monitoring how you ’re doing			0
there ’s a lot of pressure going into it			0
‘ and a lot of it is down to whether the course suits you			0
‘ i defended at @entity24 where @entity19 won his , ironically			1
unfortunately , i did n’t do a very good job of it			0
the course was very narrow and i never got to grips with the way to play it really			0
‘ but in @entity19 ’s case , he has established himself as a world star now in the top 10 and playing steady golf , so there ’s no reason why he ca n’t do a good job this year			1
‘ it ’s a tall order			0
people wonder why there was a such a gap from when i won it to @entity19 ’s success last year			1
and he certainly has a chance			0
’ @entity123 : @entity22 points to the sky after his final putt of the @entity3 last year silhouette : @entity22 raises his proudly deserved trophy to the sky @entity129 and @entity130 will be among the @entity2 contingent hoping to stake their claim in @entity133 this week			1
the @entity134 took the honours in 2011 and , the latter , a year beforehand in 2010			1
but @entity14 , who led from start to finish when he celebrated glory in @entity141 over four decades ago , believes the opening round will be the key to the eventual winner on a tough @entity48 track			1
‘ who knows who will win it ? ’ said the 69 - year - old , who now resides in @entity147			1
‘ all of these predications we try to make is a lot of hot air			0
until you get through the first round , a lot of people underestimate the importance of it			0
you ca n’t win it after the first round but you can lose it			1
‘ more important for the great players , if they get a good first round on the board , if they are in the first three , they get mentally engaged and they know that they are of that pedigree that they can win			2
‘ sometimes though we tend to forget that , at this level , it ’s a mind game			0
without @entity169 , who remains sidelined by a back injury to miss his second major tournament of the year after his absence at @entity173 , @entity14 believes there is a real opportunity for the rest of the field			1
‘ there will be some shocks , ’ he said			0
surprise characters crop up in majors and sometimes they can take the lead early on			0
‘ everyone wants @entity169 to get better			0
he ’ll be missed by the fans			0
there ’s no question over his impact on the game over the last 15 years or so			0
but he ’s still just one player			0
contender : northern irishman @entity129 is one of the favourites in the field going into the tournament knocking about : as is fellow countryman @entity130 , who will be hoping to repeat his win of 2010 whoever does go on to emulate his @entity3 feat , @entity14 insists they will face the most stringent of examinations from what is arguably the most difficult major to land			1
‘ i honestly think the @entity3 is the supreme test , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s the supreme examination because it allows the @entity204 to set the course up on the edge			0
‘ at @entity208 you ca n’t do much - weather-wise you ’ve got to keep the greens and pin placements reasonable			2
but at the @entity3 they can take it to the limit with pin positions and green speeds			1
so , it ’s not just a test of golf , it ’s a test of patience and a lot of things			0
‘ there ’ll be guys this year who will hit shots at @entity48 that deserve birdies			2
but they might come off with bogeys or worse sometimes			0
it ’s swallowing that and moving on that the @entity3 is as much about than anything			1
‘ it ’s no good going in thinking , “ that ’s not fair ”			0
it ’s just how it is			0
so , whoever comes out winning will have dealt with all the necessary obstacles			0
‘ @entity48 with the false fronts , lots of undulation and pin placement that goads guys into going for them			0
the ball can run off and you might end up 40 yards away after hitting what appeared to be a good ball			0
‘ of course , winning @entity208 was the one i always wanted to win because it ’s my home country ’s major and it is the oldest			1
but there ’s no doubt in my mind that the @entity3 is the hardest			1
they take it to courses that they can set on the edge			0
they like to watch the guys suffer ! ’ @entity256 was a special guest at the @entity257 , authorised retailer of all major golf brands including @entity260 and @entity261			2

@entity22 ended 43 - year wait for @entity26 winner at @entity24 last year
@entity14 was the last one to win the @entity3 back in 1970
69 - year - old is the most celebrated @entity50 captain in @entity51 *history*
says the @entity3 is the toughest major of the four to triumph in
