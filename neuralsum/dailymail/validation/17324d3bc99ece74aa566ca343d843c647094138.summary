‘ there have been no talks , ’ he insisted			0
@entity1 ’s star has fallen for club and country			2
he has been unable to consistently force his way into @entity9 ’s starting line - up since his recovery from a long - term knee - ligament injury			2
although @entity13 publicly maintains that he wants @entity1 , 26 , to sign a contract extension , @entity9 will listen to offers in the summer if they can not agree terms			1
@entity1 goes through his paces alongside fellow @entity9 and @entity6 star @entity47 on thursday there is a lingering suspicion at the @entity26 that his agent has already been tapped , given the nod that another @entity52 team will give @entity1 the cash , the contract and the playing time to satisfy him			1
this time , @entity9 are prepared to listen			2
@entity1 has not played a full 90 minutes for @entity9 this season and he can not realistically expect to win a place in a congested , fully fit squad ahead of @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 or @entity62			1
despite yesterday ’s denial , his frustration with life on the substitutes ’ bench is well known			0
@entity68 , @entity6 ’s manager , called it a ‘ dog eat dog world ’ yesterday , admitting that @entity1 had little chance of getting into the national team if he is not playing regularly for @entity9			1

@entity82 ’s goal involvement from his 10 appearances this season — two goals and no assists			0
2 @entity1 has provided just two assists in the @entity88 over the past six seasons			2

on friday evening at @entity107 he will be named among the substitutes after working with the @entity6 squad all week in the build - up to the clash with @entity112			2
@entity1 has missed out a lot of international football over the years			2
cruelly discarded by @entity115 on the eve of the @entity117 , he missed last year ’s tournament in @entity119 through injury			0
he last played for @entity6 in the @entity122 qualifier with @entity106 in september 2013 and has only just regained a place in the squad after last season ’s knee injury			2
@entity68 said : ‘ he ’s been very unlucky with injuries			0
he ’s recovering now , and coming back to the @entity9 team in the last couple of months			2
‘ he ’s been with me in my three years without necessarily playing the main figure			0
whenever we thought we could use him , he ’s got injured again			0
crossroads is probably quite a tough term , but it is an important few months for him			0
‘ you can see he likes to be with @entity6 but he has to satisfy a few critics and make certain : a ) he stays fit and b ) gets his place back as one of the first names on @entity9 ’s team sheet			1
when he does that , he might be pushing ( to be ) a first name on @entity6 ’s team sheet			2
’ on friday night @entity1 misses out again because an established front line — @entity145 , captain @entity146 and @entity62 — have taken @entity6 to the top of their @entity149 qualifying group			1
@entity1 has made just 13 appearances for @entity9 this season and was heavily criticised when he failed to take his chances in the 3 - 0 win over @entity155 on march 14			1
@entity68 has told @entity1 he needs to be back as one of the first names on @entity9 's team - sheet @entity1 is likely to start from the bench again on friday when @entity6 take on @entity112 at @entity107 @entity68 said : ‘ it ’s a dog - eat - dog world			1
there ’s always someone waiting to take your place			0
‘ sometimes through no fault of your own , you can be injured			0
but then your position , which had looked very secure , suddenly six months down the line is not so secure			0
‘ that is something all footballers learn to live with			0
if you want to be an @entity6 player , you ’d like to hope that ’s an even bigger thing you ’d learn to live with			0
‘ in an ideal world , we ’ll have players like @entity28 coming through on a regular basis , upsetting the applecart and making sure people do n’t think their place is secure for ever			0
’ this is @entity1 ’s life for the moment , a substitute for club and country as he waits for @entity9 to show their hand this summer			2
either that , or they will show the winger the door .			0
