@entity0 may be still licking their wounds from their derby day mauling at bitter rivals @entity3 on sunday , but the reigning @entity5 champions looked in determined mood as they trained on wednesday			1
preparing for their weekend clash at home to @entity11 , @entity8 's stars were all in action at their @entity14 base			2
fresh from scoring @entity5 goals 99 and 100 in his @entity0 career , striker @entity15 was back to his menacing best as he took part in shooting practice against goalkeeper @entity21			1
@entity0 players were trained on wednesday ahead of their match on sunday at home to @entity11 @entity0 striker @entity15 fine - tuned his finishing skills with some shooting practice at their @entity14 @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 are reportedly two players who could leave the club in the summer @entity15 , who signed a new five - year contract with the club in august , will certainly be one player who will remain at the @entity36 next season			1
the same can not necessarily be said for @entity29 and @entity30 - who are reportedly two players @entity0 are willing to listen to offers for in the summer			2
and the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during wednesday 's session as they appeared as @entity30 underwent some stretching exercises			0
in the aftermath of sunday 's defeat to @entity11 at @entity47 , @entity50 pundits @entity48 and @entity51 were highly critical of @entity29			0
of the 31 - year - old , the latter said that he had become ' a bit of a liability ' for @entity0 in the past two years , despite being instrumental to their @entity5 title win last season			1
toure was criticised by @entity50 ' @entity48 and @entity51 after @entity0 's loss at @entity3 ' when he is playing and he has the ball at his feet , he is a real threat going forward , ' the former @entity61 midfielder said			2
' when they do n't have the ball he does n't want to take part and come back towards his own goal			0
' ' he just does n't take part when @entity0 have the ball , they 're too easy to play against			0
and that 's a problem they 've had for the last couple of seasons			0
and maybe that 's one of the big reasons why both the @entity76 international and @entity30 have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch , but @entity8 will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season			0
the 61 - year - old 's side currently sit fourth in the @entity5 with seven games remaining - four points clear of fifth - placed @entity61 and with a far greater goal difference too			1
city players ' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on sunday to their cross-city rivals at @entity47			1
