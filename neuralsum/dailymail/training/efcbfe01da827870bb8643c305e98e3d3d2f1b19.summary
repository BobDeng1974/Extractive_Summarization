thousands of dogs are being transported to the @entity5 in squalid conditions and are often missing crucial vaccinations , before being sold to unsuspecting families for huge profit			1
a charity investigation has revealed how both corruption and ‘ shocking ’ animal welfare run through the heart of the puppy trade			0
after being brought to the @entity5 in appalling and cramped conditions , the dogs are sold on to well - meaning families , who believe they have been legally imported and undergone rigorous health checks			1
investigators said that four out of five vets they approached in @entity36 admitted to falsifying pet passports or vaccination records , or said they would be willing to			1
meanwhile , nine of the 11 breeders and dealers they tracked down in the country said they would sell underage puppies to the @entity5 , or already had done			2
dogs often travel more than a thousand miles , and many are unvaccinated – meaning they risk spreading diseases such as rabies to other family pets			0

families who buy illegally imported dogs could be hit with large vet fees and quarantine costs popular breeds such as @entity59 bulldogs and pugs are regularly advertised for sale online from around £ 750 each			1
the dealer will pay roughly £ 200 to buy each dog and arrange its transport to @entity5 , meaning they can make £ 550 per sale			1
