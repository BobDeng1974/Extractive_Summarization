the @entity10 went on to say he agreed with treasury minister @entity11 who has argued that the @entity4 should be less ‘ hateful ’ and more ‘ aspirational ’ when speaking to voters			1
and he insisted his benefits cuts were not about bashing the poor , but prompting a ‘ positive life change ’			1
mr @entity3 even likened his zeal for overhauling welfare to the crusade to end slavery , comparing himself with the great abolitionist @entity20 and the @entity22 social reformer , the 7th @entity23			1
he said reforming the benefits system was ‘ part of our party ’s historic mission			2
‘ @entity29 and @entity20 were people who faced a massive problem , a social problem , and saw only the need to change it , and embarked on that change against the vested interests and accepted wisdom of their age , and the results you can see were massive and transformational , ’ he said			0
like them , mr @entity3 added , he wanted to ‘ put hope back where it has gone , to give people from chaotic lives security through hard work , helping families improve the quality of their own lives ’			1
he backed comments earlier this week by mrs @entity50 that the @entity4 needed to change their ‘ language and tone ’			2
she told a think - tank that @entity6 too often say that , ' we ’re anti this , we ’re anti-that , we do n’t like them , we do n’t want them here '			0
the @entity58 mp added : ' if we talk about what we hate all the time , we ’re not talking about what we like and what we want to do to help people who want to do well in setting up businesses or making our schools the best			0
' we never say actually we are on the side of these people , we want this to happen and we think this is great			0
' mission : @entity3 insists his benefits cuts were not about bashing the poor , such as those featured on @entity75 's @entity74 ( pictured ) , but were instead designed to prompt ' positive life changes ' asked if he agreed , mr @entity3 told @entity77 ’s @entity78 : ' yes , absolutely			1
the last thing that politicians and others should do is to be judgmental			0
' i ’m in favour of talking about what we believe will improve life , not always finger - wagging			1
' in a speech to the @entity89 , a think - tank he set up in opposition , mr @entity3 said people should stop disapproving of benefit claimants – ' our fellow citizens ' – and instead blame politicians for creating a system that consigned them to the ' twilight world ' of state dependency			1
' casual disapproval of those on benefits is also too easy , ' he added			0
' it does us as politicians well to remember that it was generations of politicians that created this welfare system that now traps them			0
' he later said his speech had been trying to emphasise that people had been ' locked away ' from ' productive life ' by the benefits system			2
the number of workless households had fallen by 18 per cent under the @entity116 , while there were fewer people who were economically inactive than in the last two decades , he added			0
@entity121 's work and pensions spokesman @entity119 said : ' this is no time for self - congratulatory speeches from @entity3			1
his time would be better spent getting a grip of his lamentable policies and the hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money he is needlessly wasting			0
' @entity130 general secretary @entity129 said : ' @entity3 ’s welfare reforms have led to elderly and disabled people being kicked out of their homes for failing to pay the hated bedroom tax , while dying cancer sufferers have faced benefit sanctions for not finding work			2
' to compare this government - directed cruelty to the abolition of slavery is frankly offensive '			0

@entity10 said @entity4 should be less ' hateful '
he believes voters want positive aspirational *advice* , not finger - wagging
@entity3 insists benefits cuts will promote ' positive life changes '
