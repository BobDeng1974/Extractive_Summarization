the @entity0 has the technology to turn your @entity2 into an eavesdropping tool , revealed a well - known privacy advocate at a hacker conference in @entity7 on monday			1
journalist and security expert @entity8 used his slot at the event to pull back the curtain on the @entity0 's arsenal of high - tech spy gear including how it can use radar wave devices to harvest electronic information from computers , even if they are n't online			1
@entity8 told hundreds of computer experts gathered at @entity21 's @entity20 that his revelations about the @entity0 's capabilities ‘ are even worse than your worst nightmares			1
’ a backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device ( stock image pictured ) that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection ‘ what i am going to show you today is wrist - slittingly depressing , ’ he said			1
even though in the past six months there have been an unprecedented level of public scrutiny of the @entity0 and its methods , @entity8 's claims - supported by what appeared to be internal @entity0 slideshows - still caused a stir			2
one of the slides described how the @entity0 can plant malicious software onto @entity47 's @entity2 , giving @entity49 intelligence agents the ability to turn the popular smartphone into a pocket - sized spy			1
‘ @entity47 has never worked with the @entity0 to create a backdoor in any of our products , including @entity2 , ’ the company said in a statement to @entity55			1
@entity8 told hundreds of computer experts gathered at @entity21 's @entity20 that his revelations about the @entity0 's capabilities ' are even worse than your worst nightmares ' ‘ additionally , we have been unaware of this alleged @entity0 program targeting our products			1
’ another slide showcased a futuristic - sounding device described as a ‘ portable continuous wave generator , ’ a remote - controlled device which - when paired with tiny electronic implants - can bounce invisible waves of energy off keyboards and monitors to see what is being typed , even if the target device is n't connected to the internet			2
a third slide showcased a piece of equipment called @entity80 , which can tamper with wireless internet connections from up to eight miles ( 13 kilometers ) away			0
an @entity0 spokeswoman , @entity82 , said that she was n't aware of @entity84 's presentation , but that in general should would not comment on ‘ alleged foreign intelligence activities			2
’ ‘ as we 've said before , @entity0 's focus is on targeting the communications of valid foreign intelligence targets - not on collecting and exploiting a class of communications or services that would sweep up communications that are not of bona fide foreign intelligence interest to the @entity49 government			0
’ the investigation followed earlier reports of the @entity0 ( headquarters pictured ) spying on @entity47 products , which suggested a ' backdoor ' in @entity100 could provide hackers with valuable information			1
@entity47 said at the time that it had never worked with the @entity0 to deliberately weaken its products the documents included in @entity8 's presentation were first published by @entity7 magazine @entity105 on sunday and revealed details about the undercover work carried out for the @entity0 by an elite team of hackers known as @entity110 ( @entity110 )			1
@entity110 's mission is ‘ getting the ungettable , ’ and an unnamed intelligence official had said that @entity110 had gathered ‘ some of the most significant intelligence our country has ever seen			0
’ when agents with the @entity110 division want to infiltrate a network or a computer , they turn to their technical experts known as @entity122 ( @entity122 ) , which produces tools for penetrating network equipment and monitoring mobile phones and computers			0
@entity122 's products have helped @entity110 agents infiltrate networks and divert or even modify data wherever the @entity0 's usual methods are n't enough			2
@entity110 has a catalog of high - tech gadgets for hard - to - crack cases , including computer monitor cables specially modified to record what is being typed across the screen , usb sticks secretly fitted with radio transmitters to broadcast stolen data over the airwaves , and fake base stations intended to intercept mobile phone signals on the go			1
@entity147 base stations , for example , make it possible to monitor mobile phones , such as that of @entity7 chancellor @entity151 in the catalog a rigged monitor cable , which allows ‘ @entity110 personnel to see what is displayed on the targeted monitor , ’ goes for $ 30			0
an ‘ active @entity147 base station ’ that makes it possible to mimic the cell phone tower of a target network and thus monitor mobile phones , is available for $ 40,000			0
computer bugging devices disguised as normal usb plugs , capable of sending and receiving data undetected via radio link , are available in packs of 50 , for over $ 1 million			0
these tools have n't just been used exclusively to track suspected terrorists			0
@entity147 base stations , for example , make it possible to monitor mobile phones , such as that belonging to @entity7 chancellor @entity151			0
radar systems such as the one known as @entity173 have also been used to spy on allies , for example @entity177 representatives in @entity178			0
and the hardware ' implants ' found in the @entity122 catalog evidently have been used to tap encrypted faxes			0
protestors hold up placards featuring a picture of former @entity0 contractor @entity186 and with the world asylum on it during a march against the spying methods of the @entity49 in @entity21 , northern @entity7 on sunday the catalog is n't up to date and many of the software solutions on offer date from 2008			1
as a result some apply to server systems or mobile phone models that are no longer on the market			0
a @entity199 for gaining total access to @entity2 , which was still new at that time , was still in development , though its specifications were still listed in the catalog			0
one internal @entity0 document dating from 2004 describes a spyware program called @entity206 that it provides ' unique backdoor access to personal computers of targets of national interest , including but not limited to terrorist targets			2
' the @entity0 has also targeted products made by well - known @entity49 manufacturers and found ways to break into professional - grade routers and hardware firewalls , such as those used by internet and mobile phone operators			2
@entity122 offers malware and hardware to take advantages of weaknesses in computers made by some of the world 's leading information technology companies , including @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity233 's @entity232 @entity8 and @entity105 have both played an important role in the disclosures of @entity0 leaker @entity186 , but neither has clarified whether the most recent set of slides came from @entity186			1
