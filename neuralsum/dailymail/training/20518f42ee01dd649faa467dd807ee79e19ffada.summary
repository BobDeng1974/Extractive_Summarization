the @entity0 divided fashion opinions when it was unveiled just a month ago			1
@entity2 had its reservations about the fashion tech accessory , and even @entity5 was on the fence			1
but for @entity8 and @entity9 , it was love at first sight			1
now @entity12 is the first fashion title to feature the gadget on its cover for november 2014			1
@entity18 stands unrivalled as the world 's leading style bible , so this placement certainly solidifies the @entity0 's fashion credentials			1
and certainly comes as no surprise that the wearable tech features on the version in @entity12 - where science and technology have developed rapidly in recent years			1
@entity37 , editorial director of @entity18 commented : ' as the very first fashion publication to feature the recently launched @entity0 on its cover , @entity12 is following in the @entity18 tradition of moving with the times , giving our readers the first glimpse of a pioneering piece of technology that also doubles as a highly covetable fashion accessory			1
' in its slick marriage of technology , fashion and lifestyle , the @entity0 will have a significant impact on the way we live			1
' the look that @entity54 and @entity55 put together is fresh , modern and with good energy , fitting with the spirit of @entity12 which has been showcasing the best fashion around the world for the past 10 years			1
' on the cover @entity61 supermodel @entity24 models the 38mm @entity21 watch edition in 18 - carat yellow gold , with a bright red modern buckle , styled by @entity55 in a striped ensemble by @entity68 , and photographed by long time @entity18 collaborator @entity54			1
when @entity21 unveiled its first wearable accessory to a high - profile crowd last month , it certainly proved to be the tech event with the biggest fashion buzz this year			2
the item marks a brand new territory for the tech giant , who , for the first time ever , are targeting the style - conscious rather than tech - obsessed			2
but the @entity0 is less of a risk and more an organic step into the next phase of @entity21 's development			2
they recently hired ex @entity85 boss @entity84 , @entity88 's ceo @entity87 and - crucially - @entity89 , ex @entity90			2
the gadget , which must be paired with an @entity93 , debuts next year and prices start from £ 216 in the @entity95			2
it comes in three versions - sport , standard , and a luxury edition , with finishes including stainless steel and gold plated			2
the display is highly customisable and wrist bands range from leather and stainless steel to sports models in hues from pink to blue			2
@entity2 's @entity109 wrote at the time : ' @entity111 certainly has a lot going for it from a technological standpoint , but we 'll never vouch for wearing a digital watch with a tux			0
if you have a special occasion coming up , opt for something classic ... remember ; the @entity0 is built to check emails			0
you do n't want your wrist lighting up with a message from the ceo when you 're toasting the groom			0
' the @entity0 was unveiled just a month ago to mainly positive reactions meanwhile style bible @entity8 was more open and complimentary in regards to its look			0
' from a fashion point of view , the external aesthetic seemed neutral : neither super-stylish nor repellent			0
i would imagine that geeks would love it more than aesthetes , ' writes @entity136			0
' i suspect that @entity138 , as a non-digital specialist , would fail to use this device to its full capacity			0
but i like the idea of setting the visual aspects according to my mood			0
' a bunch of violets to set off my purple outfits ? why not look at my watch - and dream			0
' @entity5 , editor of @entity18 , was a little less convinced : ' it is immaculate in terms of how function meets design , ' she said			0
' the issue is really about how much people want to wear something so clearly , essentially an amazing gadget			1
' fashion editors were curious about an expected wearable accessory from fashion designer @entity160 ; a high - fashion smart bracelet from @entity163 ; and a smart ring from @entity165			0
' this is just the beginning			0
how long before there is a partnership with @entity169 and @entity170 to do more sophisticated faces ? ' said @entity172 , features and special projects reporter for @entity9			0
