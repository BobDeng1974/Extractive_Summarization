by @entity0 anti-fracking protesters could be forcibly removed from their camp by bailiffs today after a court ruled against them			2
after a two - day hearing the landowners were granted a possession order for the land where an energy firm is carrying out drilling			1
@entity11 was granted permission for exploratory gas drilling at the site and said it is seeking methane and shale gas but has no immediate plans for fracking			2
police officers work to remove protesters who chained themselves to a coffin at the entrance of @entity11 exploratory drilling site at @entity25 , where landowners can now evict demonstrators but scores of anti-fracking protesters descended on @entity25 , near @entity29 last november , erecting a large camp of around 60 tents and caravans along the farm track			1
in the past four months more than 80 protesters have been arrested and charged with a variety of offences including obstruction and drink - driving			1
the protest is estimated to have cost £ 750,000 so far with @entity40 having to prioritise more and more officers to the site			0
@entity43 served notice to the protesters last month saying they were going to the @entity46 in @entity47 in a bid to have them removed for trespass			2
they were granted the order yesterday though the judge allowed protesters leave to appeal which will be heard today at noon , after which protesters could be evicted if the appeal fails			1
but the @entity57 understands protesters will simply move from the farm track onto nearby agricultural land and continue their opposition			2
@entity62 , of @entity47 , said : ‘ it may be the camp moves somewhere else , perhaps down the road			0
i think some people have already moved to some woods nearby			0
amid numerous stunts and protests in four months , 80 protesters have been arrested and charged with offences the protesters can now appeal			1
if that fails , they will be evicted from the @entity29 site ‘ this event was about stopping fracking around the country as a whole			1
we are disappointed with the decision			0
if we lose the appeal we will clear the site but the protest will continue			0
’ fracking involves the fracturing of rock with a pressurised liquid to release shale gas , with potentially vast reserves untapped across swathes of the @entity90			0
the government and industry chiefs say fracking is a safe , cheap way of harvesting fuel and more environmentally friendly than oil exploration			0
but campaigners say there is clear evidence that fracking causes serious air and water pollution and leads to earth tremors			0
protesters at the @entity25 site , which lies in the shadow of the @entity107 , have accused the police officers of violence and bully - boy tactics			1
but police accused protesters themselves of resorting to dirty tactics after a police officer was injured by a ‘ booby - trap ’ drum containing barbed wire and glass			1
the protests outside @entity120 in @entity121 last year cost the police force more than £ 3million he suffered a cut to his hand last month as he attempted to free two anti-fracking protesters who locked themselves to the concrete drum			2
@entity128 claimed the continued presence of scores of protesters would lead to ‘ escalating problems ’ at the site			2
but the protesters argued any possession order would represent a ‘ disproportionate interference ’ with their right to protest under @entity138 and 11 of the @entity139			1
however their claims were rejected by judge @entity142 who said that permitting the protesters to occupy the site would be a breach of domestic law , because they did not have consent to remain there			0
campaigners had also sought to establish that the camp - which runs along a grass verge next to a road - was located on land leased by @entity154 to a farmer , making any possession order useless , and that they had a right to protest on the road because it ’s also a public footpath			1
but the judge said the verge did not form part of the lease because it had ‘ no agricultural purpose ’ and added the protests - which had seen protesters sat down or lying down in the road to stop traffic reaching site - exceeded ‘ permissible highway use and as result constitutes a trespass against the owner of the land over which the right runs			2
’ @entity173 , one of the defendants in the case , said : ‘ this case is a success in the campaign to highlight the fact that fracking is highly dangerous			0
’ around 1,000 anti-fracking campaigners marched peacefully through @entity182 at the weekend to protest against the controversial drilling at @entity25			1
@entity11 is due to complete its drilling by the end of this month			0
large scale anti-fracking protests in @entity188 , @entity121 last summer went on for weeks and cost the police force more than £ 3m			0
more than 80 people , opposed to @entity120 ’ exploratory oil drilling operation , were arrested in angry confrontations at the site			1
in january @entity120 said it was to scrap plans to use fracking near the village because rock already contained natural fractures .			0
