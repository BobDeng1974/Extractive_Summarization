by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:01 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 09:24 est , 12 august 2013 @entity2 has urged communities to ‘ seize ’ the chance to welcome shale gas drilling near their homes – saying the gas sites are only the size of a cricket pitch			1
the prime minister said allowing the controversial practice of extracting gas will drive down prices for consumers , as well as creating more than 70,000 jobs			2
but @entity17 refused to say whether mr @entity2 would be happy to see a plant spring up near his @entity20 home			0
doubts : prime minister @entity2 , on a to @entity23 om @entity22 , urged all areas to welcome fracking for shale gas mr @entity2 said he wanted to challenge ‘ myths ’ surrounding shale gas exploration , saying there is no evidence it is unsafe or damages the countryside			1
he said those living near proposed shale gas sites could potentially benefit from lower council tax bills			1
‘ it ’s been suggested in recent weeks that we want fracking to be confined to certain parts of @entity41 , ’ mr @entity2 said			2
i want all parts of our nation to share in the benefits : north or south , @entity47 or @entity46			0
’ however , the prime minister 's spokesman today repeatedly refused to directly say that mr @entity2 would be happy to have a fracking site on his doorstep in his @entity53 constituency			2
challenged at least nine times , the spokesman said that the @entity49 ' huge potential benefits ' from shale gas extraction although it was important that local people were properly consulted			1
' ultimately , that view is as relevant in his constituency as anywhere else in the country , ' the spokesman said			0
protests : exploratory drilling by energy firm @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68 have attracted protestors which have tried to block lorries reaching the site welcome : @entity2 argued that every community - north or south - had to be open to the idea of fracking taking place in their local area battle : the prospect of drilling across the country has pitched the government against environmental protestors the prime minister spoke out after weeks of protests against a proposed fracking site near @entity87 in @entity88			1
he slapped down the remarks of @entity90 , who caused controversy last month by suggesting shale gas drilling should be confined to ‘ desolate ’ parts of the north and not ‘ beautiful ’ areas in the south			1
environmentalists claim the process could contaminate water supplies and even trigger earthquakes			0
forty wells are expected to be drilled before the 2015 general election , half in the @entity103			0
there could also be widespread drilling across the @entity106			0
@entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity68 and @entity110 are also thought to contain gas reserves			0
mr @entity2 said fracking should be embraced because it would follow in @entity41 ’s proud tradition of having the world ’s first industrial revolution			0
‘ my message to the country is clear – we can not afford to miss out on fracking , ’ he said			2
‘ for centuries , @entity41 has led the way in technological endeavour : an industrial revolution ahead of its time , many of the most vital scientific discoveries known to mankind , and a spirit of enterprise and innovation that has served us well down the decades			0
‘ fracking is part of this tradition – so let ’s seize it			2
’ the prime minister said fracking should be embraced because it would follow in @entity41 's proud tradition of having the world 's first industrial revolution he told the @entity133 : ‘ if we do n’t back this technology we will miss a massive opportunity to help families with their bills and make our country more competitive			1
’ energy bills would fall if we can lower our dependence on imported gas , he added			0
‘ latest estimates suggest there ’s about 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas lying under @entity41 at the moment – and that study only covers 11 counties			1
‘ to put that in context , even if we just extract a tenth of that figure , that ’s still the equivalent of 51 years ’ gas supply			2
' mr @entity2 also quoted one study which predicted 74,000 jobs could be created in drilling and other businesses which would supply the new industry			1
he said fracking would bring money to local neighbourhoods , because 1 per cent of the revenue will go straight back to residents who live nearby			1
and he vowed to make the case that ‘ fracking is safe ’ – saying there is no evidence that it could contaminate water supplies or trigger earthquakes			1
he added : ‘ one myth still remains – that fracking damages our countryside			1
i just do n’t agree with this			0
‘ i am proud to represent a rural constituency			0
i would never sanction something that would ruin our landscapes and scenery			0
‘ shale gas pads are relatively small – about the size of a cricket pitch			1
but more than that , similar types of drilling have been taking place for decades in this country			0
‘ the @entity187 is one of the most beautiful parts of @entity41 and it has been home to conventional oil and gas drilling since the 1980s			2
the huge benefits of shale gas outweigh any very minor change to the landscape			1
