ephedra foeminea waits for the full moon to bloom and produces a sugary droplet to attract pollinating insects it may not turn into a bloodthirsty beast in the moonlight , but a peculiar plant does rely on the lunar cycle to survive			1
called @entity10 , the plant waits for the full moon to ' bloom ' and is the only plant species so far that ’s known to behave in this way			1
at night , the non-flowering relative of conifers secretes tiny droplets of sugary fluid to attract pollinating insects			0
they ooze from the plant ’s female organs where seeds are produced			0
when a nocturnal butterfly or insect lands on one of the tasty transparent orbs at night , the pollen it ’s carrying is used to fertilise the seed			2
researchers from @entity35 noticed the droplets at the same time of the year having conducted four years of research , @entity33 reported			2
when they went to study the plants in @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 in @entity43 in 2013 , they were baffled as to why the orbs were not there , but after abandoning their field work to get some dinner , noticed that there was no moon this time			1
they checked data to see whether the creation of the globules coincided with the full moon and were shocked to find they did			1
researcher @entity56 said : ‘ it all fitted , and all we had to do was wait for 2014 's full moon in july to see if that was what the plants were waiting for , and it absolutely was			1
’ the study , published in @entity65 , says : ‘ the exact timing of pollination in @entity68 varied considerably from year to year , but was correlated with the full moon of july			1

’ a stock image showing the phases of the moon is pictured dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung			2
badgers tend to raise their leg to urinate at full moon , to mark their territory before mating , @entity77 reported			1
corals release huge amounts of sperm and eggs at full moon			1
by synchronising spawning , they increase the chances of eggs being fertilised			0
while lions hunt most effectively at night , they sometimes kill during the day when there 's a full moon			1
pets injure themselves more when the moon is full , although there is no reason why			0
a study found a 28 per cent increase in dog visits to the vets and 23 per cent increase for cats			0
‘ to our astonishment , even cones that appeared too young to be pollinated … secreted pollination drops from a pore - shaped micropylar opening during the peaking period at full moon			2
‘ one to two weeks earlier , when the moon was new and in its first quarter , we observed the exact opposite ; drop secretion was weak to non-existent and pollinators were absent			0
’ while the globules materialised on @entity68 at full moon , the same was not true of a relative found in the area			2
it ’s unknown how the plant ‘ knows ’ when it ’s full moon , but they can detect different intensities of light during the phases of the moon as well as gravity , which they could potentially use to identify lunar phases			1
while @entity134 may be the first plant to respond to the lunar cycle , numerous animals are known to experience behaviour changes at different times during the cycle			0
for example , dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung and crabs and seabirds are also said to use the moon to carry out daily activities			0
ephedra foeminea is the only known plant species to follow the lunar cycle , but dung beetles use polarised moonlight to navigate in straight lines while moving dung ( a stock image is shown ) and crabs and seabirds are also said to use the moon to carry out daily activities ‘ correlation with the lunar cycle has been described regarding activity , reproduction , communication and navigation for a number of vertebrates and invertebrates , ’ the study says			2
‘ even eyeless animals such as reef corals correlate their reproduction with the phases of the moon			0
‘ therefore , it is not surprising that the moon can influence plants as well , e.g. as a consequence of plant – animal interactions			0
’ dr @entity56 said : ‘ to the best of our knowledge , this is a first			0
‘ at night , the many pollination drops glitter like diamonds in the full moonlight , a spectacular sight also for the human eye			0

@entity187 waits for the full moon to produce *nectar*
experts from @entity35 studied plant in @entity41 and @entity43
plant 's ' aim ' is to seduce insects so they will fertilise its seed
it 's the only species that 's known to follow the moon 's phases to survive
