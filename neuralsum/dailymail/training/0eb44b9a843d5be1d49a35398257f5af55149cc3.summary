by @entity0 published : 04:18 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 04:53 est , 7 november 2012 women have branded its latest clothing ranges unfashionable , poor - fitting and confusingly sized			2
so perhaps it is little wonder that @entity7 ’s clothing division has reported its worst sales performance for three years			2
the high street giant admitted a string of mistakes with its womenswear was behind the 10 per cent fall in profits			1
poster girls : @entity15 and @entity16 are just two of the famous faces who promote the @entity7 range the disappointing performance was highlighted by a surge in sales by budget fashion chain @entity23 , with hard - up consumers flocking to its cut - price clothing			2
@entity23 said its rise in profits was thanks to the increasing numbers of middle - class converts – customers who might usually turn to @entity7 for their clothes			1
responding to @entity7 ’s fall in pre-tax profit to £ 289.5million for the half - year from £ 321million in the same period the previous year , chief executive @entity35 said he had inherited a list of problems from his predecessor , sir @entity40			1
he said these included the retailer ’s computer systems , which were ‘ not fit for purpose ’ and the stores themselves , which ‘ lacked inspiration ’			2
feeling the heat : @entity7 chief executive @entity35 is under pressure to deliver improvements the @entity51 also said @entity7 ’s website was poor , while its supply network was ‘ complex and inflexible ’ – resulting in stores running out of stock on popular items			1
on its website – which allows customers to leave reviews of the clothing they have bought – there are a string of complaints about the quality of some of the fabrics used in the clothing , and the ‘ inconsistent ’ sizing which has left many women confused			0
some styles are also branded ‘ uncomfortable ’ , ‘ frumpy ’ and ‘ unflattering ’			0
yesterday @entity7 said it had taken decisive action to turn the clothing division around and back key fashion trends			0
mr @entity35 said a lingerie range designed by supermodel and actress @entity76 had shifted more than 100,000 pieces since the end of august , making it one of the fastest - selling ever			1
big drop : @entity7 saw their half year profits fall to the lowest point for three years mr @entity35 has also overhauled the retailer ’s clothing team , hiring former @entity85 and @entity86 boss @entity84 to revitalise womenswear and @entity88 – who formerly worked at @entity89 – as the new director of lingerie			1
he made a barbed jibe at @entity23 ’s success – saying @entity7 would focus on quality when it launches its own version of ‘ fast fashion ’ , adding : ‘ we are not interested in disposable clothing ranges			1
’ but @entity23 supremo @entity99 , buoyed by a 15 per cent rise in sales to £ 3.5billion for the year , snapped back , saying : ‘ we do n’t look on ours being disposable either – what makes us difficult to compete with is our quality which is good , particularly on basics like t - shirts , underwear , nightwear and towels			1
our quality stands in comparison with anyone out there			0
’ mr @entity99 , boss of @entity23 ’s owner @entity116 , said he had even had to increase the number of tills by a third in @entity23 stores to take shoppers ’ cash			0
but both retailers warned recent trading had been tough , with mr @entity35 warning the market was ‘ volatile ’ and the second half of the year would be tough as retailers tried to outdo each other with price - cutting promotions			1
critiqued : @entity130 is a bad fit , customer reviews say @entity7 customers ’ dissatisfaction with many of the retailer ’s products is shown in the reviews they have written on its website , which include : @entity142 jeans £ 32.50 ‘ they dragged on the ground when i walked and the hem was about two to three inches wide and very heavy			1
i used to have perfect length fit from jeans from @entity7 , what has happened ? ’ 2 - pack : assorted @entity154 @entity153 £ 22.50 ‘ does anyone try these on at the design stage ? these look great and are the right size but , and it ’s a big but , the straps are so far out towards your shoulders they cut into your arms			1
unless you walk around behaving as though you have a coat hanger down the back of your shirt , they are really uncomfortable			0
’ @entity166 with @entity167 £ 59.00 ‘ really like the style but the 8 was too tight and the 10 too big			1
’ body - shape @entity174 £ 25.00 ‘ i do n’t know how i managed to get these so wrong ! i ’m usually a 12 medium but when i tried these on they were two inches too short , low on the waist so gave me a muffin top where i do n’t really have one			1
’ ‘ a great fit ... for about two hours			0
after four hours of wearing them they were falling down and i quite literally stepped out of them without undoing them ... needless to say they have gone back			0
come on @entity7 , get it right ! try some quality - control before you put them on the shelves			0
’ per @entity192 £ 39.50 ‘ this had to be returned as it did n’t fit correctly			2
disappointed with the sizing – no continuity ! two other dresses ordered with this one , all different styles and all three had to be returned as did n’t fit			0
’ per @entity194 £ 45.00 ‘ the dress was very nice but did n’t fit me well , was large across the top so the neck hung awkwardly at the front			2
i went into the store and tried a size smaller , but although it was a bit too tight , the neck part was still too loose			0
’ @entity204 £ 29.50 ‘ lovely blouse but cut very straight and i found it gaped too much around the bust area			2
’ per @entity209 £ 45.00 ‘ this is not good ; the fabric has a very “ man - made ” feel to it ; it is rather unflatteringly clingy and the so - called appliqué is not ! it is devoré and not well done			1
i was disappointed and it went straight back			0
’ per @entity220 £ 39.50 ‘ i had high expectations for this dress [ pictured right ] , but was so very disappointed			2
@entity215 , tight across the chest and arms ; even a size larger was too tight			0
looks lovely on the model but awful on me ! it was probably the most unflattering dress i have ever tried on			0
a no - no ! ’			0
