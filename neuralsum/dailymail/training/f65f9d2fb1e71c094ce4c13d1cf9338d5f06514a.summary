they always win at football , grab the deckchairs , drive gleaming muscle cars and work in a seemingly recession - proof country - but @entity6 are incapable of enjoying life			1
that is the finding of a study which says that the ' joy gene ' in the @entity11 is broken			0
@entity12 , a market - research and consultancy institute based in @entity16 , found that 46 per cent of @entity6 say they are increasingly unable to enjoy anything due to the stress of everyday life and the feeling of being constantly reachable - on the phone , the @entity21 , the computer			1
glum : @entity6 chancellor @entity24 has endured many sleepless nights as she tackles the eurozone crisis the difficulty was even more pronounced among the study 's younger participants , 55 per cent claiming to feel they have lost their ability to ' feel good			1
' whether it 's with food , alcohol , holidays or relaxing -- germans do n't have the capacity to enjoy things - they ca n't even let go when they 're having sex			1
according to the researchers ; ' our joy gene is increasingly defective - we 've forgotten how to enjoy ourselves			1
' the highly personal interviews revealed that @entity6 ca n't let go during sex with many saying they constantly have film and advertising images run through their minds			1
' this results in the requirement to cut a good figure even during sex , ' @entity48 says			1
' that is to say , holding in their bellies instead of enjoying the moment			1
' ' the results conform to the image that many @entity60 have of @entity6 in this era of economic crisis as self - denying overachievers who ca n't even turn off the fun - brakes when vacationing at the beach , ' said news magazine @entity66			1
no joy : @entity6 chancellor @entity24 watches as @entity68 are beaten by @entity69 in the @entity70 and @entity71 , left , celebrates ' the positive image that they enjoyed during the 2006 soccer @entity74 in @entity6 seems gone			1
' ' at that time , @entity6 really radiated a zest for life , ' says @entity78 psychologist @entity48			1
' but this mood shifted beginning in 2008			0
' the problem is that @entity6 feel weighed down by the ongoing @entity60 debt and currency crisis			1
it 's more than simple complaining			0
people have the feeling that we have to shoulder the entire crisis here			0
' the common currency , however , does n't shoulder all the blame - the main thing standing in their way is their own perfectionism			2
during hours of individual and group interviews , the researchers analysed how 60 subjects felt pleasure			0
they also surveyed 1,000 men and women			0
among survey respondents , 81 percent said that they experience pleasure best when they have managed to achieve something first			0
' as the saying goes , business before pleasure , ' said 61 - year - old female participant @entity105			2
@entity6 anguish : @entity68 's @entity6 midfielder @entity107 reacts after missing a crucial penalty in their @entity70 final against @entity69 but this maxim does n't seem to serve the @entity6 well - they even feel burdened by the pressure to enjoy things			1
' people often told us that they would come home after a stressful day , but were unable to even say what they 'd accomplished , ' @entity48 reported			0
' and then the people around them say , " hey , just relax			0
" enjoyment then turns into an obligation			0
' meanwhile the small pleasures of life - a glass of wine , a relaxing bubble bath , or a nice restaurant with delicious food - rankle with the @entity129 mind			2
' this glut of offerings pressures people into thinking , ' i must enjoy everything ' , ' @entity48 says			2
during the course of the study , the researchers managed to unlock a typically @entity6 sequence of steps to enjoyment , which they named ' pleasure dna			1
' feel good factor : @entity6 enjoyed themselves during the @entity74 in 2006 - but with economic woes the national mood has worsened the first step involves the feeling of having earned something			1
this is followed by preparation for the longed - for pleasure , such as booking a day of spa treatments			2
but then comes the biggest hurdle : letting go and clearing the mind			0
' only when a surprising positive moment supervenes can a fully integrated sense of enjoyment follow , ' said @entity48			0
' but many @entity6 apparently lack crucial components to this pleasure dna			1
though some 91 per cent of the study participants said that pleasure makes life worthwhile , only 15 percent could recall moments in which they were able to forget their worries and feel ' truly happy			2
' and two thirds of those quizzed said happiness came at the expense of others - one motorbiker said he was ' delighted ' when he blew exhaust fumes into an open topped car as he was stopped at traffic lights			2
@entity174 also floats their boat			0
' many think , " man , how does he do it " , ' psychologist @entity48 said			0
' it 's a @entity129 mentality one can also see in the euro crisis			0
when we get agitated about the @entity186 ' high pensions and ample vacation days , naturally pleasure - jealousy plays a role , ' she says			0
' but @entity6 do n't want to actually be @entity186			2
that would n't suit us			0

55 *%* of young @entity6 said they were no longer able to ' feel good '
germans are not even able to enjoy sex - because they instead worry about holding their bellies in
they enjoyed themselves during 2006 @entity74 - but economic problems have brought fresh gloom
