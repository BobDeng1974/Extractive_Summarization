a super computer has become the first in history to pass the @entity3 , a benchmark of artificial intelligence set by codebreaker @entity5 a super computer has been created which can simulate human conversation so well that it has convinced people it is a teenage boy			1
the machine is the first in history to pass the ‘ @entity3 ’ - a benchmark of artificial intelligence set by codebreaker @entity5			1
the @entity15 computing pioneer devised the test in 1950			1
he said that if a machine is indistinguishable from a human , it is ‘ thinking ’			2
now a computer programme called @entity22 , developed to simulate a 13 - year - old boy , has now managed to convince 33 per cent of judges that it is human			1
no computer had ever previously passed the @entity3 , which requires 30 per cent of human interrogators to be duped during a series of five - minute keyboard conversations			1
five machines were tested at the @entity31 in central @entity32 to see if they could fool people into thinking they were humans during text - based conversations			1
professor @entity36 , from the @entity37 which organised the test , said : ‘ in the field of artificial intelligence there is no more iconic and controversial milestone than the @entity3			0
‘ it is fitting that such an important landmark has been reached at the @entity31 in @entity32 , the home of @entity46 science and the scene of many great advances in human understanding over the centuries			1
this milestone will go down in history as one of the most exciting			0
’ the successful machine was created by @entity56 - born @entity55 , who lives in the @entity57 , and @entity59 @entity58 who lives in @entity56			1
mr @entity55 said : ‘ it ’s a remarkable achievement for us and we hope it boosts interest in artificial intelligence and chatbots			2
’ the computer programme called @entity22 ( pictured ) was developed to simulate a 13 - year - old boy			1
during tests it managed to convince 33 per cent of judges that it was human professor @entity36 from the @entity37 , pictured following a previous experiment to build a cybernetic arm , said the computer passing was an important milestone prof @entity36 said there had been previous claims that the test was passed in similar competitions around the world			2
‘ a true @entity3 does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations , ’ he said			0
‘ we are therefore proud to declare that @entity5 ’s test was passed for the first time			2
’ prof @entity36 said having a computer with such artificial intelligence had implications for society and would serve as a ‘ wake - up call to cybercrime ’			0
the event took place on the 60th anniversary of the death of mr @entity5 , who laid the foundations of modern computing			2
during the @entity15 , his critical work at @entity46 ’s code - breaking centre at @entity101 helped shorten the conflict and save many thousands of lives			0
instead of being hailed a hero , mr @entity5 was persecuted for his homosexuality			0
after his conviction in 1952 for gross indecency with a 19 - year - old @entity109 man , he was chemically castrated			0
two years later , he died from cyanide poisoning in an apparent suicide , though there have been suggestions that his death was an accident			0
last december , after a long campaign , mr @entity5 was given a posthumous @entity117			0
the @entity3 was introduced by @entity15 codebreaker @entity5 in 1950 as part of his paper @entity120 in which he predicted that computers would one day be programmed to acquire abilities rivalling human intelligence			1
he proposed a test called @entity125 , which would identify whether a computer is capable of thought			0
a person , called the interrogator , engages in a text based conversation with another person and a computer - and must determine which is @entity134 they are unable to do so the computer is deemed to have passed .			0

computer programme called @entity22 convinced 33 **%** of judges it is human
five machines were tested at the @entity31 in central @entity32
@entity143 requires 30 **%** of human interrogators to be duped by a computer
benchmark devised by @entity15 codebreaker @entity5 in 1950
machine created by scientists @entity55 and @entity58
