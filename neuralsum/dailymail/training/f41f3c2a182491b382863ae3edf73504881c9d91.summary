no huge banners , no pre-match announcement and no chants			0
@entity3 is back in management — but the hearts and minds operation might take some time			1
when there was a half - hearted call for a wave from fans early in the first half , the fallen star of the @entity8 pantomime was too busy directing @entity14 to respond			1
a year is a long time to be out of management , yet no time at all in the context of the damage he has done to his reputation			0
he is back now , though , and the challenge will be to ensure @entity23 owner @entity22 has not hurt his own name for no tangible reward			1
@entity26 spoiled @entity23 's party with his equaliser for @entity29 at the @entity30 @entity26 celebrates with team - mate @entity31 ( top ) after his goal levelled the scores at 1 - 1 @entity35 opened the scoring with a stunning free - kick that looped over the @entity29 wall @entity23 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity39 6 ; @entity40 6 ( @entity41 83 ) , @entity42 6.5 , @entity43 6 , @entity44 6 ; @entity45 6.5 ( @entity46 82 ) , @entity47 7 ; @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 ( @entity50 70 , 6 ) , @entity35 7 ; @entity51 5.5 subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 goals : @entity35 24 booked : @entity47 , @entity40 @entity29 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity58 6 ; @entity59 6 ( @entity60 70 , 6 ) , @entity61 6 , @entity62 6 , friend 6.5 ; @entity64 6 , @entity65 6.5 , @entity66 7.5 , reach 5.5 ( @entity67 56 , 7 ) ; @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 6 ( @entity70 82 )			1
subs not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75			0
goals : @entity67 58 booked : @entity77 , @entity78 @entity79 : @entity66 referee : @entity81 6.5 attendance : 16,347 the best way to do that will be through results			0
it might be disheartening but it is true and , in that regard , a draw against the @entity88 ’s third - placed team will work wonders			2
it would have been more had @entity3 ’s new side held on to the lead gained through @entity35 ’s 25th - minute free - kick			1
but @entity26 , on loan from @entity96 , levelled in the second half and ensured there were only half smiles for @entity3 and @entity22			1
against the backdrop of a rotten week , that should be enough			0
the toll was clear on @entity22 ’s face as he made his way to his seat ahead of kick - off			1
like the @entity108 in the summer , @entity23 ’s chairman attempted to defend @entity3 ’s conduct and only succeeded in shooting himself in the foot			1
he has until early next week to explain his @entity112 and @entity113 remarks to the @entity114 , amid calls for him to step down			0
for his part , he has already claimed any suggestion from the authorities that he is racist will lead to his resignation			0
speaking before this fixture , he said : ‘ should they even suggest i ’m guilty i would immediately resign from my position as chairman of @entity23			2
@entity35 scores his side 's first goal in their championship match against @entity29 at the @entity30 @entity35 wheels away in celebration after giving @entity3 the perfect start in charge of @entity23 ‘ i hope they do n’t and i do n’t see anything like that happening because i ’m absolutely anti-racist , always have been , always will be			1
however , if they have any questions i ’m willing to answer it			0
’ it is a dramatic threat and one that would not be popular in these parts			0
he was afforded an ovation before the game and 30 seconds into the game there was a chant of ‘ one @entity22 , only one @entity22 ’			0
@entity29 ’s contingent responded by singing : ‘ you ’re a town full of racists			2
’ and : ‘ he texts what he wants , @entity3 , he texts what he wants			2
@entity22 , who has received widespread criticism this week , celebrates @entity23 's opening goal @entity3 's first game in charge of @entity23 ended in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity29 at the @entity30 meanwhile , the manager at the heart of this storm was a blur of hand movements and skips in the technical area			1
his enthusiasm was obvious and , for a time , it seemed like his fortune might turn			0
@entity35 sounded an alarm with a delightful free - kick in the 10th minute which dipped on to the top of the bar			1
it was from an identical position on the edge of the area that he scored			0
from there it was largely a game controlled by @entity23			2
in their previous 12 games , they had won only once ; in the same stretch @entity29 had lost only once			2
@entity26 celebrates after his goal levelled the match at 1 - 1 at the @entity30 on saturday afternoon @entity3 barks instructions during his first game back in management for a year @entity68 of @entity29 ( right ) evades the challenge of @entity47 during the match @entity29 almost levelled shortly before the break			1
in a move of brilliance , @entity189 and @entity68 produced a one - touch sequence to put @entity69 through on goal , but the striker curled the ball wide of the far post			0
@entity26 came on 10 minutes into the second half and within three minutes had equalised			1
@entity3 buried his head in his hands , but said later : ‘ i did n’t know what the crowd would be like but everyone was so welcoming			2
‘ i am very proud that on the day my father and son were here and the hairs were up on the back of my neck			0
i ’ve been long time in the @entity88 and i ’ve no doubts as to to the size of the task			0
