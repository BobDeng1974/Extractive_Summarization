the union 's leader @entity6 is pictured @entity4 ’s biggest trade union has set up a new wing – which can only be joined by the unemployed			0
@entity11 mps said it was ‘ scandalous ’ that @entity3 , led by the hard - left former docker @entity6 , was trying to exploit benefit claimants for political and financial purposes			1
in return for £ 26 a year in ‘ subs ’ , the jobless members of @entity19 receive perks including discount designer glasses , advice on ‘ claiming the right benefits ’ and a pre-paid debit card offering cashback in high street stores			1
the union , which is a key backer of the @entity28 , last month called for the first general strike in the @entity4 since 1926 in protest at the government ’s austerity measures			0
benefit claimants will bear a significant part of the impending public spending cuts , with chancellor @entity36 planning to slash an extra £ 10 billion from the welfare budget			1
but the recruitment drive could also help to shore up @entity3 ’s bank balance : the union has been shedding members at a dramatic rate in recent years , losing 262,740 of its 1.4 million strength since 2007			2
this decline has alarmed @entity28 , which has received more than £ 6 million in donations from the union since @entity45 became leader			0
a new poster campaign , timed to coincide with an anti-austerity rally on saturday , will promote @entity19 as ‘ the union for people who are n’t in paid work ’			1
it claims membership ‘ provides a way people can find and use their political voice ’			0
other perks include a debit card that offers six per cent cashback at ‘ high street retailers ’ , a tax - refund service – under which the union checks whether the member has overpaid tax when in work , and takes a cut of any refund – and a ‘ welfare benefits check - up ’ to target the ‘ millions of pounds per year that goes unclaimed by people who are entitled to benefits ’			1
members are also entitled to discount vouchers from @entity70 , and can get deals including ‘ designer 2 - for - 1 glasses ’			2
those who find work again no longer qualify to belong to @entity19			0
if they then switch to full membership of the union , it will cost them £ 132 a year			0
controversial : a new poster campaign , timed to coincide with an anti-austerity rally on saturday , will promote @entity19 as ' the union for people who are n't in paid work ' last night @entity11 deputy chairman @entity83 said : ‘ it is scandalous that @entity28 ’s largest donor , @entity3 – which backed @entity45 for the leadership – is looking to politically mobilise the unemployed and plug its falling membership subs			1
‘ the public expects trade unions to protect the rights of their members in the workplace – not try to fill gaps in their funding off the back of the unemployed			0
is @entity45 really comfortable taking money from a union that is acting in such a cynical way ? ’ a @entity3 spokesman said last night : ‘ i am surprised that the @entity100 are opposed to us trying to help people to get back to work			2
‘ this is an effective way of giving unemployed people and students the access to financial and employment advice , which they lack			0
‘ it is complete nonsense to suggest that we are trying to “ mobilise ” benefit claimants for political purposes , or as a new way to fill up our coffers			1
