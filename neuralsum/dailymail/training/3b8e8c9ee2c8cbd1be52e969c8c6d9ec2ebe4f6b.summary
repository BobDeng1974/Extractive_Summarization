by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity3 's atmosphere contains an unexpectedly large amount of an ozone - depleting compound banned over 25 years ago			1
@entity7 scientists have admitted they are baffled by the discovery of @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , which was once used in applications such as dry cleaning and as a fire - extinguishing agent			1
it was regulated in 1987 under the @entity14 along with other chlorofluorocarbons that destroy ozone and contribute to the ozone hole over @entity18			1
purple and blue represent areas of low ozone concentrations in the atmosphere ; yellow and red are areas of higher concentrations			0
to investigate the discrepancy , @entity32 and colleagues used @entity7 's @entity35 @entity34 and data from global networks of ground - based observations			1
the @entity9 measurements used in the study were made by scientists at the @entity43 's ( @entity43 's ) @entity42 and @entity43 's @entity44 at the @entity45			2
model simulations of global atmospheric chemistry and the losses of @entity9 due to interactions with soil and the oceans pointed to an unidentified ongoing current source of @entity9			2
the results produced the first quantitative estimate of average global @entity9 emissions from 2000 - 2012			1
parties to the @entity14 reported zero new @entity9 emissions between 2007 - 2012			1
however , the new research shows worldwide emissions of @entity9 average 39 kilotons per year , approximately 30 percent of peak emissions prior to the international treaty going into effect			2
' we are not supposed to be seeing this at all , ' said @entity32 , an atmospheric scientist at @entity7 's @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68 , and lead author of the study			2
' it is now apparent there are either unidentified industrial leakages , large emissions from contaminated sites , or unknown @entity9 sources			0
' as of 2008 , @entity9 accounted for about 11 percent of chlorine available for ozone depletion , which is not enough to alter the decreasing trend of ozone - depleting substances			1
still , scientists and regulators want to know the source of the unexplained emissions			0
for almost a decade , scientists have debated why the observed levels of @entity9 in the atmosphere have declined slower than expectations , which are based on what is known about how the compound is destroyed by solar radiation and other natural processes			0
' is there a physical @entity9 loss process we do n't understand , or are there emission sources that go unreported or are not identified ? ' @entity32 said			0
with zero @entity9 emissions reported between 2007 - 2012 , atmospheric concentrations of the compound should have declined at an expected rate of 4 percent per year			2
observations from the ground showed atmospheric concentrations were only declining by 1 percent per year			0
in addition to unexplained sources of @entity9 , the model results showed the chemical stays in the atmosphere 40 percent longer than previously thought			0
the research was published online in the aug. 18 issue of @entity111			0
' people believe the emissions of ozone - depleting substances have stopped because of the @entity14 , ' said @entity115 , chief scientist for atmospheres at @entity7 's @entity66 , and a co-author of the study			1
' unfortunately , there is still a major source of @entity9 out in the world			0

carbon *tetrachloride* ( @entity9 ) was used in applications such as dry cleaning and as a fire - extinguishing agent .
it was regulated in 1987 under the @entity14 along with other chlorofluorocarbons that destroy ozone and contribute to the ozone hole over @entity18
@entity7 admits it is baffled by find
