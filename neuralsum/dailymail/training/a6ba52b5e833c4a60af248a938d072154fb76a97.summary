former senior aides to @entity1 have hit back at the ' craven hypocrites ' in the @entity3 who just days before the election were clamouring for jobs in a @entity1 administration and are now belittling him			1
' i 'm sure governor @entity1 is finding out now who his real friends are , ' a former adviser told @entity13			2
' there were one or two well - known figures who were late committing to support him , were the most eager to curry favour when it looked like we would win and are now out there trashing the governor			1
' in politics , when you win you are a genius and when you lose everyone calls you an idiot			2
but to see the way certain craven hypocrites are acting right now really sticks in the craw			2
' a happy @entity30 : but since his defeat in the presidential election , @entity1 has been under constant attack from other republicans speaking on @entity35 , @entity36 , a former top foreign policy adviser to @entity1 , accused some of the former @entity39 supporters of being fair weather friends			1
at a big event in @entity43 just days before the election , he said , there were leading figures cozying up to @entity1 and trying to land cabinet positions			1
' tens of thousands of people , you could feel the energy , a hundred top - tier @entity1 surrogates were at the event , ' he remembered			0
' i ’m backstage with some of them - i wo n’t mention their names - but they ’re talking about @entity1 like he ’s @entity56			0
' " his debate performances were the best performances of any @entity3 nominee in presidential history			1
" they were talking about him because they believed he was going to win in four or five days			0
and in fact , some of them were already talking to our transition to position themselves for a @entity1 cabinet			2
' fight : @entity1 took on @entity69 in a bitter battle for the @entity71 waged over several months defeat : the @entity72 after the candidate conceded defeat to @entity69 on november 6 within days , however , there was a ' stunning ' turnaround as the same people turned on @entity1 with a vengeance			2
' they were on television , it was unbelievable , it was five , six days later , absolutely eviscerating him , ' @entity36 said			0
but the other senior adviser , who declined to be named when criticising senior @entity3 , singled out governor @entity84 of @entity85 and @entity86 as among those who had been quickest to lambast @entity1			1
after @entity1 told donors on a post-election conference call that many voted had plumped for president @entity69 because he had offered them ' gifts ' , @entity84 said @entity1 's comments were ' absolutely wrong '			1
he said : ' we have got to stop dividing @entity95 voters			0
we need to go after 100 per cent of the votes , not 53 per cent - we need to go after every single vote			0
' allies : @entity1 spent time on the campaign trail with @entity85 governor @entity84 betrayal ? @entity84 and @entity86 have both criticised @entity1 in the wake of his landslide defeat that was a reference to @entity1 's notorious ' 47 per cent ' comments in which he said that proportion of voters was dependent on government and would inevitably back a @entity110			1
@entity111 called the ' gifts ' comments ' nuts ' and ' insulting ' to voters			0
the anonymous adviser said : ' @entity84 wanted very , very much to be vice president			1
he appeared publicly with governor @entity1 after the 47 per cent comments , which the governor himself said were totally wrong			0
' @entity86 made it clear to us he wanted to be part of a @entity1 administration			1
' both these guys - and others - were the governor 's best friend when it seemed he was on the brink of becoming our 45th president			0
now they 're calling him a bum			0

presidential candidate has come under fire from republicans after loss
but aides say figures like @entity84 and @entity86 were *desperate* for positions in his cabinet if he had won
