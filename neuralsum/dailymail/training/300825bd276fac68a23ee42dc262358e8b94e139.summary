@entity0 £ 112 , aqaq.com probably the most daring of all the outfits , this jumpsuit ’s deep , square neckline shows more of my chest area than i ’d usually expose on a beach in high summer			2
yet i absolutely love it			2
while it shows off plenty of cleavage , it reveals little else			1
the wide - legged all - in - one exudes 1970s glamour , plus it ’s comfy			1
as it draws attention to only one place , make sure your cleavage is up to the task			1
i got some extra help from @entity25 ’s @entity24 ( £ 32 , very.co.uk )			2
verdict : daring and dramatic , but a big success			2
@entity27 £ 22.50 , @entity28 body necklace , £ 12 , riverisland.com the closest i ’ll ever get to feeling like @entity30 , this shimmering gown exudes old - school @entity33 glamour , and the deep v - neck — accessorised with a body chain — inevitably draws the eye			1
i have an average - sized @entity39 chest and , having had three children , my cleavage is not as perky as it was			1
but this plummeting neck creates an impressive embonpoint , accentuated by the gathered waist			1
verdict : a dress that will definitely put me in the spotlight , without leaving me over-exposed			1
@entity47 £ 30 , missguided.co.uk shoes , £ 185 , lucychoilondon.com on women of my age , this kind of clingy dress screams ‘ cougar ’			0
i ’d have avoided a red , @entity56 number like this even in my 20s			1
and it ’s clearly not flattering now i ’m in my 40s			0
however , the bodycon tube does create impressive cleavage			1
it ’s tight enough to hold my boobs firmly in place , and the inbuilt cups give me a sculpted , full shape			2
verdict : undeniably good cleavage — but i feel like i ’ve gone out in my underwear ! @entity69 £ 50 , lipsy.co.uk shoes , £ 198 , lucychoilondon.com this unusual dress will make you the centre of attention			1
just not the right kind of attention			0
the old rule of thumb says you should never show boobs and legs at the same time : this breaks that rule			0
there ’s no doubt that it shows off my cleavage , but it exposes too much of everything else as well			2
verdict : a definite step too far			0
@entity88 £ 55 , @entity28 i feel like a @entity90 reject			0
this gets top marks for flounce — yet in the chest department , it ’s decidedly flat			0
i struggle through layers of chiffon and complicated straps , but it ’s when i finally get the dress on that the work begins			0
i spend ten minutes trying to get my boobs in place — each time , they slide into nothingness under folds of pleated fabric			0
in the end , i resort to strategically placed body tape to give my chest the uplift it needs			0
verdict : strictly to be avoided .			0
