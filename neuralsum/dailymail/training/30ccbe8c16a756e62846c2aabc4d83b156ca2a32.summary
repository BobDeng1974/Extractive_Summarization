a baby boy with a flattened head is on the road to recovery thanks to a special helmet which encourages his skull to grow in a normal shape			1
six month old @entity7 was diagnosed with flat head syndrome , a condition which causes his forehead to bulge out because the back of his skull has become flat			1
his family managed to raise the £ 2,000 needed for the custom - built helmet and special pillow to treat the condition , so that @entity7 's head would develop without an unusual shape			1
after wearing the helmet for a month , the flattened bit of @entity7 's head has already grown by 7mm and his family hope the progress will continue			1
six month old @entity7 now has a custom - built helmet to cure his flat head syndrome , thanks to fundraising efforts from the local community , who raised £ 2,000 for his care @entity7 's mother @entity28 noticed her son 's ears were lopsided and his forehead pushed out , so she took him to a specialist who diagnosed flat head syndrome			1
here , she is pictured with her son now he has a special helmet which will help his head grown normally @entity7 's mother , @entity28 , 24 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , said first spotted the change in the shape of her son 's head when he was two months old			1
she was told it was due to tight muscles in his neck and was nothing to worry about			0
however , it got progressively worse to the point where @entity7 's ears were lopsided and his forehead pushed out , and ms @entity28 decided further checks were necessary			2
a trip to the specialist clinic when he was four and a half months old revealed he had flat head syndrome , which is medically known as plagiocephaly and brachycephaly			1
this common condition causes the head to become either flattened on one side , causing it to look asymmetrical and distorted , or flattened at the back , which can cause the forehead to bulge out			2
sometimes the ears may not be the same height and the head may look like a parallelogram when seen from above			2
the head can be flattened in the womb , and the condition is more common in babies born prematurely because they 're squeezed through the birth canal when their skulls have n't fully developed			2
but the most common cause is because babies now sleep on their backs every night – a position doctors advise to prevent cot death			0
babies sometimes develop a flattened head when they 're a few months old , usually from sleeping on their back			2
it 's known as ' flat head syndrome ' or ' moulding ' and there are two types – plagiocephaly and brachycephaly @entity81 is the most common type and occurs when the head is flattened on one side , causing it to look asymmetrical and distorted			1
for example , the ears may be misaligned and when seen from above the head , looks like a parallelogram			2
@entity90 is when the back of the head becomes flattened , causing the head to widen			2
to compensate , the front of the skull sometimes bulges out			0

when they lie on their backs , the full weight of their heads rests on the back of their skulls and the pressure of the mattress on their soft skull causes it to become flat			2
the conditions is not thought to be medically dangerous , and it will often correct itself over time			0
when they lie on their backs , the full weight of their heads rests on the back of their skulls and the pressure of the mattress on their soft skull causes it to become flat			2
although not thought to be medically dangerous , the flattened head shape can become permanent - which can have psychological implications for children as they grow up			1
doctors say if parents move their babies onto their tummies during the day , as well as changing them from different chairs , so there is n't constant pressure on the back of the head , the condition should improve within eight weeks			0
however , mrs @entity28 was told of a private treatment called helmet therapy , in which babies wear a custom - built helmet which applies pressure to the bulging parts of his skull and relieve pressure from the flatter parts , allowing growth in these areas			1
the controversial treatment is not available on the @entity146 as doctors say there is not enough evidence it works if parents change their babies position in the day			0
mrs @entity28 decided this treatment would be best for @entity7 , but as the helmets cost £ 2,000 , she could n't afford it			1
the family could manage to fund a £ 500 deposit , but desperately wanted to raise the rest of the money to ensure that @entity7 received the treatment			1
they were astonished when the local community rushed to aid them , offering to hold a fundraiser at @entity164 , so @entity7 would receive a helmet			1
local businesses donated prizes for a raffle , including a brand new car and a football signed by @entity171			0
family , friends and other members of the community also made donations			0
they have now been able to buy the helmet , which @entity7 must wear 23 hours a day , taking it off for only half an hour in the morning or evening			1
ms @entity28 , who is also a mother to three - year - old @entity179 said she wanted the treatment as she was worried having an oddly shaped head would affect @entity7 in later life			1
she said : ' i was told that he would not be able to wear a bike helmet when he was older			0
' little boys also have short hair so you would have been able to see it			0
' when we put the helmet on the first few times he would have a cry but he is used to it now			0
you forget it is there			0
the only thing is you ca n't kiss him properly so when it is off you get the kisses			0
' ms @entity28 and her mother @entity199 want to thank everyone in the local community who helped raise money for @entity7 's treatment			2
ms @entity28 said : ' it is nice to know that people i do n't even know have shown their support			0
with it being so close to @entity211 too and people still handing out donations , it has been brilliant			0
' @entity7 has been wearing the helmet for around a month now a recent check revealed the flat part of his head has already grown by 7mm			1
after a month he is no longer in the ' serious ' category for flat head syndrome , instead he is now in the ' moderate ' category , his mother said			1
the £ 2,000 raised will be used to pay for @entity7 's helmet as well as a special pillow for when he no longer has to wear it			1
ms @entity28 said : ' i would like to say a huge thank you to everyone			0
if i could afford to pull £ 2,000 out of my own pocket then i would			1
