@entity0 has warned against expecting too much too soon of @entity1 - but would have no issues if the fit - again forward joined up with @entity3 for the november internationals			1
@entity1 came off the bench for the last 10 minutes of @entity8 's 3 - 0 @entity7 win over @entity9 , and looked lively as he tested goalkeeper @entity10 with an angled drive after cutting in from the right			1
it has been a long road back for the 25 - year - old , who suffered what would prove to be a seriuos knee injury during the closing stages of the @entity19 tie against @entity20 in january , ruling him out of contention for the @entity22			2
' hopefully @entity1 will come on and have no setbacks now , but we always have to be cautious			1
the battle is not won yet - at nine or 10 months out , you have ups or downs and i will have to manage that well , ' said @entity0			1
' if he wants to go ( with @entity3 ) , i am happy for him to go and train , and maybe get a few minutes			0
' i am happy for that because it will help his development			0
is he completely ready ? i think it is a bit early , but to be in the squad would be good for him			0
' @entity0 has yet to decide whether to give @entity1 a start against @entity49 in the @entity50 on tuesday night			1
one player , though , set to be central to the @entity52 ' once again will be @entity53			2
the @entity55 forward drew more plaudits after taking his tally to 10 with a brace to finally breakdown @entity9 's stubborn resistance			2
@entity53 had been denied by a string of fine saves from @entity10 , before charging on to the end of a deep cross by full - back @entity65 to power a header into the bottom corner			0
@entity1 ( pictured replacing @entity69 ) was given the last 10 minutes against the @entity9 ' he finds the resources to get you a goal when it is 0 - 0 , that is what is important , ' said @entity0			1
' it is always very interesting when you look at the number of goals people score - how many times do they score at 0 - 0 ? they are the guys who can really make the decision			0
' @entity53 has already had a lot of decisive goals and he does n't score when it is 4 - 0 , he scores when it is 0 - 0			0
' @entity0 feels there is plenty more to come from the former @entity89 forward			2
' we are in a job where you can always improve , ' he said			0
' @entity53 is unbelievably keen to develop , work and train - he just loves football			0
' @entity0 , though , admits he will have to carefully temper @entity8 's formidable attacking options			1
' we have good pace - ( @entity100 ) @entity99 , @entity1 and @entity53 all have pace , but it is also about balance , ' the @entity8 boss added			1
' the difficulty for us might be there , to keep the balance offensively and defensively and put all the good players on the pitch			0

@entity8 *welcomed* back @entity1 against @entity9
but the @entity52 ' manager @entity0 said not to expect too much
@entity1 could play against @entity49 in the @entity50
@entity69 has said he is *thrilled* to see @entity1 return
