but yesterday , @entity5 president @entity4 performed what may have been his most tawdry exploit yet , as he promoted his company ’s expansion into @entity9			1
stepping off the first @entity5 plane at @entity12 from @entity13 , the billionaire businessman lifted up his kilt to the watching crowd to reveal pants bearing the slogan ‘ stiff competition			0
’ @entity19 : sir @entity4 lifted up his @entity20 in @entity12 today to promote his new @entity5 @entity22 flights self - promotion : @entity4 flashed his suggestive underwear to a crowd of onlookers including @entity9 's deputy first minister @entity27 the crude tongue - in - cheek phrase alluded to mr @entity4 ’s newly launched domestic service , @entity22 , which will now offer @entity5 flights between @entity12 and @entity31 , and @entity32 , in direct competition with @entity34			1
never one to shy away from the limelight , mr @entity4 – who had a @entity9 grandmother and is married to a @entity38 – stood on an elevated platform on the windy runway and said it was ‘ great to be in @entity12 ’ before he exposed his underwear to a crowd which included deputy first minister @entity27			1
speaking after the stunt , mr @entity4 said he was ‘ enjoying wearing a kilt ’			1
no shrinking violet : @entity4 was hoping to draw attention to @entity5 's new domestic services between @entity13 and @entity12 , @entity31 and @entity50 ‘ despite the weather it is nice to have a bit of fresh air and it is very comfortable , ’ he added			1
‘ i ’ve got to the age where it is wise to always wear something under my kilt - especially in weather like this			2
’ this is not the first time the @entity5 mogul has resorted to such uncouth publicity stunts			0
the new @entity22 service lauched yesterday will be the first time @entity5 has operated connecting flights from @entity9 destinations , and mr @entity4 said he was ‘ excited ’ to have been given the airport slots that came available after domestic airline @entity70 was forced out of business			1
‘ we are delighted that we managed to pick up these slots as it means we can offer stiff competition to @entity34 , ’ said the @entity5 executive			0
honorary scotsman : @entity4 said that he was enjoying wearing his kilt saying it was ' nice to have a bit of fresh air ' ‘ there are a lot of people from around the world who love to fly to @entity12 and @entity31 and now we can finally now compete properly with @entity34 and give people the opportunity to travel up here with @entity5			1

‘ i would love to be flying to @entity97 as well , but for some bizarre reason the competition authorities , who bequeathed us these slots , did n’t allow us to have the slots to compete with @entity70 airways out of @entity97 ’ , added the millionaire businessman			0
brazen : @entity107 businessman @entity4 took the opportunity to have a dig at competitors @entity34 , saying that the ' stiff competition ' message was aimed at them after reporting losses of up to £ 135 million over the past two years , mr @entity4 and @entity5 ’s new chief executive , @entity114 , said that the new domestic service was just one part of the company ’s plans to push its finances back into the black			0
and despite his brazen publicity stunt , mr @entity4 was insistent that he would remain on neutral ground over the question of @entity125			0
‘ if @entity9 becomes independent they will have an airline that will be delighted to connect them to their neighbouring country and if it stays part of @entity133 , we will be equally delighted to have @entity9 people use our services to take visits down to little old @entity137 , ’ said mr @entity4			1
‘ either way , @entity5 will stay independent of this particular debate			0
