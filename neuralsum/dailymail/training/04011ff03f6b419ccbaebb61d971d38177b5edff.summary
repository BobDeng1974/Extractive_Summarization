@entity1 manager @entity0 believes @entity4 football ’s tradition of playing back to back games over @entity6 and @entity7 is in danger of damaging the image of the @entity10			1
@entity12 ’s @entity1 team looked like a team badly in need of a rest as they struggled to break down @entity16 on sunday and are now preparing for vital games at @entity18 on @entity19 and in the @entity20 at @entity21 on sunday			1
the @entity23 veteran understands that his rivals at the top end of the @entity10 have the same problems but claimed on tuesday that the @entity4 way has a direct and negative impact on the football that is shown all around the world at this time of year			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity1 manager @entity0 speaks during a press conference on tuesday a frustrated @entity12 makes a point to the fourth official during the match at @entity36 on sunday @entity16 goalkeeper @entity37 makes himself big to deny @entity38 during the goalless draw @entity12 said : ' everybody knows that a body can not recover within 48 hours			1
' therefore , there is a rule at @entity44 and @entity45 that you can not play the games so close			1
okay , that i have said			1
' that ’s scientifically proven , i have said that also			1
' everybody knows that and in spite of that , we have to play			2
' it ’s the culture of @entity4			2
i do n’t mind but it is not good for the players , for the health of the players and what i say now is it is not good for the game because i think that the @entity20 , but also the fans , want attractive games			2
' but it does n’t happen			2
' you have seen the second half at @entity16			1
you have seen the second half of @entity69 against @entity70			2
' the football was not good			2
” with @entity1 encouraged by the fact that neither @entity69 or @entity73 managed to better their own draw at the weekend , @entity12 believes there is better to come for his improving team			1
@entity12 gives a wry smile as he speaks to the press at @entity1 's @entity79 on tuesday key players such as @entity81 and @entity82 are not yet ready to return but defenders @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 are available for starting berths now			1
@entity12 added : ' i think we are still in a process			2
i think everyone can see that we are improving every week in spite of a lot of injuries , and that ’s because of the philosophy			0
' i think the players understand the philosophy , and that ’s why we are improving – but we can improve more when we have all the players available			0
' i think the fans were fantastic because we were in a moment with 11 matches and 13 points – that is not good , i think more weak than good			0
' in spite of that , the fans have supported us always and in the right way			0
i want to thank the fans for that			0
@entity38 ( right ) celebrates his goal with team - mates during @entity1 's win against @entity113 at @entity114 on @entity115 ' i think we can be satisfied about the points now – 36 points			1

' @entity4 life is fantastic because i have met only friendly people on the streets and in the restaurants where i come , ' added @entity12			0
' the food is fantastic because when i came to @entity4 everybody said the food is not good , but [ it is ] fantastic			0
' also , the wine list is fantastic			1
' i have very nice neighbours ; they are all older than me but very nice			0
i live in a surrounding environment [ that is ] fantastic			0
