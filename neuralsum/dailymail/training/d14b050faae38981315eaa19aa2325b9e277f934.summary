the @entity0 has revealed its latest recruit - a giant robotic spy disguised as a tuna			1
the robo - fish is designed to swim into enemy territory , and to guard the hulls of @entity7 boats			1
it uses a robo - fin to move silently through the water - and had been dubbed ' @entity11 ' by @entity0 bosses			1
it swims just like a fish does by oscillating its robotic tail fin back and forth			1
the unmanned underwater vehicle is able to make tight turns and move through the water quietly , making it ideal for surveillance and reconnaissance missions			1
at a length of approximately 5 feet and a weight of nearly 100 pounds , the @entity30 vehicle can operate in water depths ranging from 10 inches to 300 feet			1
the 5 - foot , 100 - pound armature was modeled after a bluefin tuna and uses a rear caudle fin to move through the water just like the fish			1
it swims just like a fish does by oscillating its tail fin back and forth , leading to its nickname of @entity14 ( below ) the robot is capable of operating autonomously for extended periods of time due to its long - lasting battery , but it can also be controlled via laptop with a 500 - foot tether			1
researchers from the chief of naval operations @entity54 and @entity55 tested the prototype at the @entity57 in @entity58 on thursday			0
the fish can be controlled with a joystick or be programmed to swim on its own			1
the unmanned underwater vehicle is able to make tight turns and move through the water quietly , making it ideal for surveillance and reconnaissance missions			1
the @entity0 hopes it could be used to inspect the hull of a ship , check waters for threats such as mines or protrusions , deliver payloads including sonar and guidance packages , and access otherwise denied areas			0
over the past several weeks , @entity55 's tuna - sized device , also known as @entity80 , has been gathering data on tides , varied currents , wakes , and weather conditions for the development of future tasks			2
' @entity30 will allow the @entity0 to have success during more types of missions while keeping divers and @entity91 safe , ' said @entity92 , director of @entity55 's @entity93			0
the @entity30 was developed to resemble the shape and mimic the swimming style of a large fish			0
at a length of approximately 5 feet and a weight of nearly 100 pounds , the @entity30 vehicle can operate in water depths ranging from 10 inches to 300 feet			2
' it swims just like a fish does by oscillating its tail fin back and forth , ' said @entity92			2
' the unit is a combination of unmanned systems engineering and unique propulsion and control capabilities			0
' its bio-mimicry provides additional security during low visibility intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( @entity117 ) missions and friendly hull inspections , while quieter than propeller driven craft of the same size , according to @entity122 ( @entity122 )			0
the robot is capable of operating autonomously for extended periods of time due to its long - lasting battery , but it can also be controlled via laptop with a 500 - foot tether			1
a @entity80 , a biomimetic device modeled after the blue fin tuna , rest on a dock at the @entity133			2
the tether is long enough to transmit information while inspecting a ship 's hull , for example , but if operating independently ( without a tether ) the robot will have to periodically be brought to the surface to download its data			0
' this project and others that we are working on at the @entity145 are important because we are harnessing the brainpower and talents of junior sailors , ' said capt. @entity149 , department head for @entity150 , @entity122			0
' the opportunity for a young sailor who has a good idea to get that idea heard , and to get it turned into action , is greater [ now ] than any other time in our @entity0 's history			0
' capt. @entity149 , head of the concepts and innovation department at the @entity122 in @entity161 , told the @entity162 it could become operational as soon as next year			0
@entity163 , a mechanical engineer with @entity55 , left , steers the @entity80 , as his colleagues @entity165 , center , and @entity167 , right , look on during a demonstration of the biomimetic device model at the @entity170 he 's behind you ! operators test the robo - fish ' the idea is to take millions of years of evolution , ' said the project 's manager , @entity176 capt. @entity176			1
' this fish has perfected itself by swimming around the water for millenia , so what we are trying to do with this project , the idea of biomimicry , is to reverse engineer what nature has already done to optimize design for @entity189 looks alive			2
' @entity149 and @entity92 , director of the advanced systems group at @entity55 , which specializes in unmanned systems and robotics , said it would take only months to complete the technology for @entity14 to swim on its own			2
@entity92 said the fish 's combination of ' efficiency , maneuverability and speed ' make it relevant for naval operations			0
while no weaponry has been developed for @entity14 , @entity149 said the full scope of applications has n't been exhausted			0
' let your imagination run wild , ' he said			0
@entity14 swims just like a fish does by oscillating its robotic tail fin back and forth .			2
