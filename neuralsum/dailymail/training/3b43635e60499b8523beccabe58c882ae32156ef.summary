by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity1 many men shy away from the yoga studio , dismissing it as ' too feminine and spiritual '			1
but a new , ' manlier ' form of the exercise loved by @entity8 and @entity9 has just launched to help @entity11 men tone up by practising it alongside their regular fitness regimes			1
' yoga is not just for girls , ' its creator @entity18 , a college @entity16 turned bodybuilder and nutrition expert , tells @entity21			1
' every athlete needs to incorporate elements of stretching and lengthening into their programme			1
' @entity26 creator @entity18 says broga works for every athlete and helps incorporate stretching into their fitness regimes @entity18 learned that the hard way , dealing with injuries from years of running , colliding and lifting that left him with what he calls a ' severely limited ' range of motion			1
he discovered yoga after signing on as an ambassador with clothing brand @entity38 - and soon started to wonder why he 'd never done it before			1
combining his studies with his own personal training experience , he created broga , a style designed to counteract everything from your desk hunch to your sofa - slouch - while emphasising moves that build upper - body strength and stability			1
it 's now being taught at locations around southeast @entity53 , with more trainers and locations being created on a near - monthly basis			1
and no , it is n't only for men			1
' we get quite a few ladies at the classes , ' says @entity18			1
' most of them are looking for a no - nonsense style that will build strength alongside flexibility			1
' and that 's where this plan comes in			1
it 's designed to work alone , but can also be incorporated into your regular regime - after all , flexibility is everything - and can be done up to four days a week			1
progress at your own level , and resist the urge to go for the hardest possible version of each move on the first go			1
this is about preventing injuries , not chasing them			1
@entity82 triangle : start in a lunge with your back foot at a 45 degree angle and all the weight on your front foot , with your front knee directly over your front foot - this is great for your back after the strength portion of each workout , you 'll move on to stretches that open up the areas you 've just worked			1
' try to progress further each time , ' advises @entity18			1
' you 'll learn to establish connections that open up typically tight areas like the chest , hips , and hamstrings			1
' most importantly , give it time to work			1
@entity26 is n't designed as a quick fix - you 've spent years ( or possibly decades ) creating imbalances in your body , so expecting to fix them with a week 's worth of downward dog is optimistic at best			1
stick with the plan for a month and you should find you 're more flexible than ever - and more than equipped to try your hand at a class if you want to			1
and no , you still do n't need to buy any patchouli oil			1
personal trainer @entity113 added : ' @entity26 helps with your mobility , flexibility , strength , core , balance and also an increased blood flow to your muscles , all which can help with weight loss			1
' increased mobility , in particularly hip and shoulder will see a marked improvement in your big lifts , full rom ( range of motion ) squats , deadlifts , overhead press etc and especially the @entity133 lifts			1
all tools to get massive			1
' likewise , certain sequences and asanas are great for warm - ups and cool downs before training			1
' pro cycling teams for instance , use sun salutations before their rides , something i also use before my sessions			1
' although the breathing and chanting does have it 's place to help calm , you take what you want from yoga , and in my case it 's a more structured way to improve my mobility and help with my other gym activities , not to meditate			1
