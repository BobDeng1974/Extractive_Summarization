in the past few months , conclusive evidence has been found that @entity1 once had water on its surface , but one greater question remains : was there , or is there still , life on @entity1 as well ? scientists may be on the brink of answering that question with an equally conclusive ' yes ' , as convincing evidence has been detected by @entity13 's @entity12			1
an instrument on the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria - like organisms on the surface - and it could be the first alien life ever detected			1
they say methane spikes on the planet could be produced by bacteria			1
and at the moment there is no alternative explanation for the spikes this image illustrates possible ways methane might be added to @entity1 ' atmosphere ( sources ) and removed from the atmosphere ( sinks )			1
@entity13 's @entity12 has detected fluctuations in methane concentration in the atmosphere , implying both types of activity occur on modern @entity1			1
' this temporary increase in methane -- sharply up and then back down -- tells us there must be some relatively localized source , ' said @entity52 of the @entity53 , @entity54 , and @entity12 science team			2
' there are many possible sources , biological or non-biological , such as interaction of water and rock			0
' previous satellite observations have detected unusual plumes of methane on the planet			0
but none of these previous readings are as extraordinary as the sudden ' venting ' measured at @entity68 , where evidence suggests water once flowed billions of years ago			0
curiosity landed in the 96 mile - wide ( 154km ) crater in august 2012 and has been exploring the region ever since			0
recently , @entity13 reported that @entity68 contained the remains of an ancient freshwater lake where there may have been a hospitable environment for life in the distant past			2
life is the chief producer of methane on @entity82 , but there are many non-biological processes that can also generate the gas			1
the low background level of methane detected by @entity12 can be explained by the sun 's rays degrading organic material possibly deposited by meteors , said the @entity13 scientists			1
but the spikes of methane required an additional source , which was unlikely to be a recent impact by comet or asteroid			0
such an object would have had to measure several metres across and would have left a large crater - no sign of which was visible			0
the short time - scale of the methane spikes did not suggest that the gas was released from volcanic deposits trapped in ice , called clathrates either			1
nor did it appear to come from the release of gaseous methane that had become bound to the soil			0
the new discovery , reported in the journal @entity115 , followed studies of gas samples by @entity12 's @entity118 ( @entity118 ) - an instrument that uses intense light to carry out chemical analysis			1
it revealed a low background level of methane , which spiked 10-fold over a period of just 60 @entity1 days			1
in four sequential measurements , @entity12 showed the methane level soaring from about 0.69 parts per billion by volume ( ppbv ) to 7.2 ppbv			2
the spikes occurred within 655ft to 985ft ( 200 to 300 metres ) of each other and less than 0.62 miles ( 1km ) from where the lower readings were detected			0
by the time @entity12 had travelled a further kilometre , the higher methane levels had disappeared			2
in their paper , the @entity139 scientists led by dr @entity140 , from @entity13 's @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity23 , wrote : ' the persistence of the high methane values over 60 sols ( @entity1 days ) and their sudden drop 47 sols later is not consistent with a well - mixed event , but rather with a local production or venting that , once terminated , disperses quickly			1
' the wind direction indicated a source to the north of the rover			0
the methane spikes were spotted by @entity12 's @entity118 ( @entity155 ) , which is part of the large @entity157 at @entity1 ( @entity159 ) suite of instruments , seen here on @entity82 before launch			1
the spikes were spotted briefly before disappearing - suggesting that bacteria is living on or under the surface life is the chief producer of methane on @entity82 , but there are many non-biological processes that can also generate the gas			1
the low background level of methane detected by @entity12 can be explained by the sun 's rays degrading organic material possibly deposited by meteors , said the @entity13 scientists			1
billions of years ago , a lake once filled the 96 - mile - ( 154 - km ) wide crater being explored by @entity13 's @entity12 , bolstering evidence that the planet most like @entity82 in the solar system was suitable for microbial life			1
that 's according to the latest findings , which combined more than two years of data collected by @entity12 since its sky - crane landing inside @entity68 in august 2012			2
scientists discovered stacks of rocks containing water - deposited sediments inclined toward the crater 's center , which now sports a three - mile ( 5 km ) mound called @entity197			2
but the spikes of methane required an additional source , which was unlikely to be a recent impact by comet or asteroid			0
such an object would have had to measure several metres across and would have left a large crater - no sign of which was visible			0
the short time - scale of the methane spikes did not suggest that the gas was released from volcanic deposits trapped in ice , called clathrates either			1
nor did it appear to come from the release of gaseous methane that had become bound to the soil			0
the @entity13 authors are cautious about jumping to conclusions , but conclude that ' methanogenesis ' - the formation of methane by microbial bugs known as methanogens - may be one answer to the riddle			2
they wrote : ' our measurements spanning a full @entity1 year indicate that trace quantities of methane are being generated on @entity1 by more than one mechanism or a combination of proposed mechanisms - including methanogenesis either today or released from past reservoirs , or both			2
' life is the chief producer of methane on @entity82 , but there are non-biological processes that can also generate the gas			1
however , the spikes of methane spotted on @entity1 required an additional source , which was unlikely to be a recent impact by comet or asteroid striking @entity1 ( shown ) - but could be explained by bacteria @entity13 's @entity1 rover @entity12 drilled into this rock target , " @entity251 , " during the 279th @entity1 day , or sol , of the rover 's work on @entity1 ( may 19 , 2013 ) and collected a powdered sample of material from the rock 's interior			1
@entity68 , on the @entity1 equator , was created when a large meteor struck the planet 3.5 billion to 3.8 billion years ago			2
at its centre is a high mountain , named @entity197 , that rises 18,000ft ( 5,500 metres ) above the crater floor			0
flowing water appears to have carved channels in the sides of the mountain and the crater walls			0
another major discovery by @entity12 was that of water bound in the fine - grained soil within the crater			2
each cubic foot of @entity1 soil was found to contain around two pints of water , not freely accessible but attached to minerals			0
@entity12 also detected different @entity1 organic chemicals in powder drilled from a rock dubbed @entity251 , the first definitive detection of organics in surface materials of @entity1			1
these @entity1 organics could either have formed on @entity1 or been delivered to @entity1 by meteorites			0
' this first confirmation of organic carbon in a rock on @entity1 holds much promise , ' said @entity12 participating scientist @entity291 of the @entity292 in @entity293			2
' organics are important because they can tell us about the chemical pathways by which they were formed and preserved			0
' in turn , this is informative about @entity82 - @entity1 differences and whether or not particular environments represented by @entity68 sedimentary rocks were more or less favorable for accumulation of organic materials			1
' the challenge now is to find other rocks on @entity197 that might have different and more extensive inventories of organic compounds			0
' researchers also reported that @entity12 's taste of @entity1 water , bound into lakebed minerals in the @entity251 rock more than three billion years ago , indicates the planet lost much of its water before that lakebed formed and continued to lose large amounts after			1
earlier findings by @entity12 revealed layers of sedimentary rock in @entity68 ( shown ) that must have been produced by water in the planet 's past billions of years ago , bolstering evidence that the planet most like @entity82 in the solar system was once suitable for microbial life - or still is observations by the rover curiosity have indicated that @entity1 ' @entity197 , where it is currently exploring , was built by sediments deposited in a large lake bed over tens of millions of years , shown in this illustration			1
@entity68 is 96 miles ( 154 kilometers ) in diameter , and at its centre today is @entity197 the rover has reached the base of @entity197 and over the coming months will begin a slow climb			0
scientists are especially keen to explore the mountain because its sedimentary layers provide tantalising snapshots of @entity1 history			0
the question of whether there is , or was , life on @entity1 may finally be answered by @entity346 's @entity345 mission , which will land a 300kg ( 660lbs ) rover on the @entity1 in 2019			2
exomars will be equipped with a 6.5 - foot ( two metres ) drill and the ability to detect biomarkers of life			0
it will not be heading for @entity68 , however			0
because it will land with less precision than @entity12 , the crater and its mountain are considered too potentially hazardous .			0

@entity13 scientists in @entity23 have revealed evidence for life on @entity1
they say methane spikes on the planet could be produced by bacteria
and , at the moment , there is no better explanation for the spikes
the signs were spotted briefly occurring by one of @entity12 's instruments
life is the chief producer of methane on @entity82 , although there are many non-biological processes that can also generate the gas
but no such process could be ruled out during tests - suggesting there may be bacteria living on or under the surface of @entity1
