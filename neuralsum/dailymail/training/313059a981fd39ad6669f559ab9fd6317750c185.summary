hopes for a new gas boom in @entity2 were dealt a blow yesterday as mps voted through a raft of tough regulations on fracking			1
@entity7 forced ministers to agree 12 new restrictions on shale drilling last night , which critics say will further hold up the industry for months or even years			1
@entity13 and @entity14 have called for the @entity2 to go ‘ all out for fracking ’ as soon as possible , as it could bring down energy bills and create thousands of jobs			1
but @entity7 frontbenchers have hardened their opposition to the idea , for fear of losing voters to the @entity24			2
ministers feared that opposition from @entity7 and @entity28 , as well as a number of conservatives who believe it will be unpopular in their constituencies , could derail the entire operation			1
the government last night agreed to a complete ban on fracking in national parks , near water sources and in areas of outstanding natural beauty			2
more rigorous risk assessments for drilling and controls on the emissions it produces will be enforced , and every resident who will have gas drilling taking place hundreds of feet underneath their homes must be notified in advance			2
one @entity65 ministerial aide @entity64 , mp for @entity66 in @entity67 where several fracking licences have been granted , had threatened to resign if the bill went through without changes			2
after the amendments were agreed , the @entity71 – which will help fracking go ahead - was voted through by mps by a margin of 324 votes to 231			1
this headed off the prospect of a complete moratorium on fracking , which was then voted down by 308 votes to just 52 , despite the backing of @entity84 mp @entity83 and others			1
@entity13 and @entity14 , pictured at a cider farm in @entity67 yesterday , have called for the @entity2 to go ‘ all out for fracking ’ as soon as possible , as it could bring down energy bills and create thousands of jobs @entity92 mp @entity91 , chairman of the @entity94 energy committee , said some of the regulations were ‘ onerous ’			1
‘ i hope there will enough momentum - at least in some parts of the country - to get it going anyway but this will make it more difficult ’ , he said			0
@entity92 mp @entity91 said some of the restrictions placed on fracking last night were ' onerous ' ‘ there has been a lot of emotion and misinformation in this debate and i think when fracking is up and running people will not be opposed to it			2
‘ some of the amendments such as notifying people , are sensible , but others are more onerous			0
we will rely on gas for many years to come , and we may as well use our own rather than other people ’s			0
’ energy minister @entity122 warned last week against too much regulation and accused @entity7 of ‘ putting their political problems ahead of the national interest			1
’ @entity2 has vast potential reserves of gas trapped in rocks hundreds of feet underground , which could be extracted by fracking – pumping water and chemicals at high pressure to crack the rocks open			0
it is already a big industry in the @entity139 where household energy costs have plummeted			0
the prime minister reiterated his support yesterday saying : ‘ i want to see unconventional gas properly exploited in our country			0
’ ‘ i think there are good reasons for doing this : we want to have greater energy security , and that should mean making the most of our indigenous energy supplies ; we want to keep prices down , i think that ’s important ; we also want to tackle climate change , and so exploiting some of our own gas rather than shipping it from other parts of the world can make a contribution			0
’ the government ’s chief scientific adviser sir @entity162 also gave his backing , saying shale gas produces fewer emissions than coal and could act as ‘ a bridge to a greener future			0
’ among those against fracking is @entity84 mp @entity83 , who was arrested at a protest against shale drilling in 2013 but a @entity92 source said after the vote : ‘ it was between getting this through with cross-party approval or simply having the applications knocked back by councils later			1
‘ we already have one of the toughest regulatory regimes in the world			0
these are not huge concessions , and we are happy if they make fracking sustainable and make people feel reassured			0
’ a government spokesperson said : ‘ shale gas has the potential to support @entity2 energy security , create 64,000 jobs and help the low carbon transition			1
we have agreed to accept this amendment , to provide clear reassurance in law , and to give this nascent industry has the best possible chance of success			0
’ ministers only rejected one of the 13 ‘ loopholes ’ @entity7 vowed to close , which would have meant that fracking could only take place at least 1,000 metres underground , as this would halt development			1
@entity84 campaigners celebrated last night			0
@entity205 at @entity206 said : ‘ public opinion and increasing concern from @entity28 has forced the government into retreat on fracking			2
’ miss @entity32 said last night : ‘ this is a huge u-turn by the government and big victory for the protection of @entity2 ’s environment			0
@entity7 has always said that shale gas extraction can not go ahead unless there is a system of robust regulation and comprehensive inspection , but @entity13 has repeatedly ignored people ’s genuine and legitimate environmental concerns over shale gas			1

mps voted through a raft of tough regulations on fracking yesterday
@entity7 forced ministers to agree to 12 restrictions on shale drilling
