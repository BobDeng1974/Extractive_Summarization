it was a demolition ; a day that ‘ scarred ’ @entity1 and provided the blueprint for how @entity4 ’s life under @entity5 can be			1
go back to lunchtime on february 8 this year and you will remember the shock of the events that were unfolding at @entity9			1
one goal then another quickly followed by two more			0
in 20 blistering minutes , @entity12 heads were scrambled and @entity4 were catapulting themselves into a title race			1
so good was the performance , @entity14 made an advert about it : @entity20 , watching on his @entity18 , declares as the fourth goal from @entity22 speeds in that ‘ i ca n’t believe what i ’m watching ’ ; @entity25 , upon hearing the news , remarks with a shake of the head : ‘ unbelievable			0
’ last time @entity1 ( left ) visited @entity9 he was ' scarred ' by the performance of @entity5 ' team the intensity of @entity4 's play resulted in @entity5 ' side leading 4 - 0 after just 20 minutes at @entity9 the @entity9 scoreboard displays the final score at @entity9 where @entity5 ' style of football shone through and it was			1
intense , dynamic , a sea of red shirts swarmed all over @entity12 to win 5 - 1			1
how @entity5 craves to see his team play that way once more , when the midfield diamond sparkles and everything clicks into place allowing games to be wrapped up before they have started			1
but without the injured @entity22 and @entity48 , now of @entity49 , @entity4 have been unable to play that vibrant style this season ; the closest they came to getting within the same vicinity was the 3 - 0 dismantling of @entity54 in august			1
evidently , it is frustrating @entity4 ’s manager			1
he has tried a number of formations to get the campaign up and running and , in the last two matches at @entity62 and @entity63 , he feels he has found a blend to get @entity4 moving forward - 3 - 4 - 3 could finally bring some improvement			1
@entity5 ’ mood on friday , however , was dark as he held court at @entity4 ’s @entity69 training retreat			1
his time with the broadcasters was an unusually short four minutes and 33 seconds , his time was similarly brief when the cameras were off			2
‘ if you look at the team the other night against @entity63 , having the pace of @entity75 in the central area of the field was key , ’ @entity5 said			2
‘ first of all , it allows you to press and it means that your game can be much more aggressive			0
@entity5 ' mood was dark on friday as this season has posed many problems compared to the last campaign the @entity4 manager 's job has even been under threat having dropped to 11th in the @entity91 table @entity5 ' side did the semi final of the @entity94 after defeating @entity63 3 - 1 on wednesday night things could have been a whole lot different had @entity4 replaced @entity48 with @entity96 ‘ you press the ball in the high areas of the field and if you looked at us in the opening 20 minutes of games , because of that pressure and suffocation of opponents , we can get the ball back higher up the field			1
it gives you more chances of a goal if you are winning it higher up the field			0
‘ i have technical players			0
they have the skills to deal with the ball in tight areas , but we have n’t had that without @entity22 and @entity48			2
we brought in @entity117 , who has had an opportunity to play in that pressing role , but that is n’t his game			2
@entity122 has also come in			0
‘ he was brought here for a reason and he has great qualities but that pressing is n’t what he does			0
when you do n’t press high up the field , your starting position to attack is much deeper			0
you can not break at speed and flood forward like we did last year because we are not that explosive			0
’ he continued : ‘ the other night ( at @entity63 ) a @entity133 coach playing 3 - 4 - 3 ? people could think he has probably thrown the team together , he has played seven midfielders			2
if it was a foreign coach ? it would probably have been a wonderful tactical idea			0
’ there was then a shake of the head			0
@entity5 has been under tremendous scrutiny as @entity4 have failed to live up to expectations and it was impossible not to think how different things might have been had they successfully signed @entity96			1
‘ he was identified for us as someone who would have been a key signing , ’ said @entity5 ‘ he would have rolled on to what we had with @entity48			1
so to not get him was bitterly disappointing , but once he was gone that was it			0
we just had to focus on what we had			0
’ so did @entity96 make the right decision ? ‘ it does n’t matter , ’ came the pointed reply			2
‘ he will probably give you that answer in 20 years			2
the best option for him			0

@entity4 's 5 - 1 win over @entity12 in february displayed @entity163 ' style of play
@entity1 was left ' scarred ' as his side *conceded* four in 20 minutes
the @entity168 has already got one up on @entity5 this season as the @entity170 had *wanted* @entity96 to replace @entity48
@entity12 are the visitors to @entity9 on *sunday* as they look for *revenge*
