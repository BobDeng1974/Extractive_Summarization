many @entity1 sunscreens contain oils that actually speed up burning by @entity3 dermatologists are issuing harsh warnings against making your own sunblock , as hundreds of @entity1 formulas make their way around the internet			1
many bloggers who post the recipes claim that store - bought sunscreens contain harsh chemicals that could be as bad - if not worse - for you than the sun. but doctors say there 's no way to guarantee homemade concoctions offer broadband protection ( that is , shield against wrinkle - inducing @entity22 rays as well as cancer - causing uvb - rays ) , or ensure that the @entity25 is high enough			1
ouch ! doctors say that if you make your own sunscreen there 's no way to guarantee yourself protection from harsh @entity22 and @entity33 rays @entity35 - based dermatologist @entity34 told @entity36 that making and using your own sunscreen is ' effectively putting your skin at risk for melanoma			1
' ' @entity42 companies invest millions of dollars formulating and testing sunscreens to ensure they are stable and effective , ' she says			1
' sunscreen companies invest millions of dollars formulating and testing sunscreens to ensure they are stable and effective ' ' tests are conducted in the lab and on humans to ensure they provide broad - spectrum protection and that the ingredients remain stable and active when mixed together and exposed to heat and sun. ' a quick @entity55 or @entity56 search shows that many of the recipes call for various oils - like coconut , almond , rosehip and carrot seed oils - which can actually promote sunburns			1
@entity65 , another dermatologist in @entity35 , explained to @entity66 that oils ' can actually absorb light , making uv rays penetrate the skin more			2
' ' that has the same effect as greasing up with baby lotion when you go to the beach , ' he said			0
but even if you do use the right ingredients , like zinc oxide , cosmetic chemists say there is an art to mixing them together , and if you do it wrong - which chances are you will - the sunscreen will be ineffective			2
so , despite all these warnings against it , why are bloggers still trying to make their own ? they say that many of the store - bought brands contain harsh chemicals that can actually alter your hormones			1
their argument might not be completely without merit			0
@entity95 , a @entity35 - based plastic surgeon and adjunct associate professor of surgery at @entity97 , explained on @entity99 's website that chemical sunscreens soak into the skin and get into your bloodstream			2
of the 15 chemical sunscreens that exist , nine are considered ' endocrine disruptors , ' meaning they interfere with the normal function of hormones			2
mr @entity95 said that the hormones most commonly disturbed include estrogen , progesterone , testosterone and thyroid			0
this can lead to early puberty and premature breast development in girls , small and undescended testicles in boys , low sperm counts , infertility , breast and ovarian cancers in women , and prostate cancer in men			0
according to the @entity127 , the ingredients that are most disruptive are : oxybenzone , octinoxate , homosalate , octisalate , and octocrylene			0
a quick survey of the most commonly found sunscreens in a @entity133 showed that almost all of them contained one or more of the above			2
that said , is there a healthy compromise ? are there any store - bought sunscreens without harsh chemicals ? @entity35 - based dermatologist @entity143 says yes : ' the chemical - free sunscreens these days are excellent			1
they 're fragrance - free and non-toxic			0
' ' there is no reason from a safety , cost , or time standpoint to make your own			0
' bloggers and doctors generally agree that mineral sunscreens are best ; that is , creams where the chief protection is provided by zinc oxide or titanium oxide			1
brands that use these minerals include @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , and @entity164			0
if you do go the natural route , keep in mind that the @entity25 is usually lower - so you will need to apply more often , as well as every time you get wet .			0
