the technique , which the @entity1 could soon start using to treat mental health problems , involves tapping acupressure points on the head and hands experts are calling on the @entity1 to start using a new self - help technique , called tapping , after its effectiveness in treating a number of conditions was proved			1
the technique , which involves tapping acupressure points on the head and hands , is showing promise as an effective form of therapy for anxiety , depression and anger			1
it is also known as the emotional freedom technique ( @entity23 )			2
researchers at @entity25 are leading research into the effectiveness of @entity23 in the @entity28			2
professor @entity29 , who led a trial of the treatment in the @entity33 area , said : ‘ @entity23 is a new and emerging therapy that can be used to treat a wide variety of conditions			1
‘ patients gently tap with their fingertips on acupressure points , mainly on the head and hands , and relate this to the voicing of specific statements			1
‘ a growing number of studies suggest @entity23 is an effective and safe treatment , and with the predicted sharp increase in the demand for mental health services – and a corresponding decrease in @entity1 resources - we feel that the use of @entity23 should now be extended			1
’ the researchers studied 39 patients during the trial and say that most improved significantly as a result of the treatment			1
dr @entity58 , gp and mental health lead for @entity61 and @entity62 , said : ‘ the effective use of @entity23 demonstrated in this study has not only influenced counsellors and therapists in @entity61 to be trained to use this method of treatment , but also local mental health charities are seeing the value in being trained to use @entity23 in the work that they do			2
’ @entity73 , 39 , was first referred to professor @entity29 with depression in 2012 after it started to impact on his family life			0
he said : ‘ i would describe the impact of these sessions like emotional first aid , it would allow me to refocus when i found myself hitting a bad patch and it brought me back into rational thinking			0
‘ i would say it created a cognitive shift and allowed me to gain a better perspective on the things i had achieved and really helped me to see more clearly and become calm and rational			0
’ the researchers say that one of the key benefits of @entity23 is that , once learnt , it can be easily self - administered meaning patients can use it on themselves for any issue , whenever it is required			1
@entity97 pole vaulter @entity95 believes tapping was responsible for his surprise victory in the 2005 @entity100 tapping or the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) is a new alternative therapy			0
it is a form of acupressure , based on the same energy points used in traditional acupuncture to treat physical and emotional ailments			1
instead of using needles , tapping with the fingertips is used to input kinetic energy onto specific meridians on the head and chest while a person thinks about their specific problem and voices positive affirmations			1
this combination of tapping and voicing is supposed to clear the ' emotional block ' from a person 's ' bioenergy system ' and restores balance in the body			0
a further study using @entity25 students has provided evidence that @entity23 could also boost performance in pressurised conditions			1
some 100 students were approached randomly to either receive an inspirational lecture or an @entity23 session ahead of giving a marked presentation			0
the 50 students who received the @entity23 remained calmer and achieved higher results			0
on average , it has been determined that just over five sessions are required to treat clients			0
this compares well with other therapies such as @entity141 ( @entity141 ) , where between six and 20 sessions may be required , depending on the condition and severity			0
dr @entity148 , associate professor in the @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 at @entity25 , said : ‘ both clinical and statistical significance have been demonstrated through our studies , the findings of which have been presented at three @entity1 conferences			2
‘ our view is that all new therapies and treatments start with little or no evidence , and further good quality studies into @entity23 would confirm its effectiveness , safety and potential within the @entity1			2
‘ it may be a bridge too far for now , but we also feel that @entity23 could be delivered within communities to provide fast access to mental health services			0
’ the research was published in the @entity170 in @entity171 .			0

the treatment involves tapping acupressure points on the head and hands
the researchers believe it should now be used by the @entity1
tapping could also be used to boost performance in pressurised *situations*
once the technique has been learnt , patients can treat themselves at home , whenever they need it
