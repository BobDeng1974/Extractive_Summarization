instead , they would have to consume the meal in a more dignified fashion - using a plate , knife and fork the new rules , proposed by @entity15 , aim to prevent customers from dropping used paper in the street - leading to a pricey and time - consuming clean - up			1

@entity36 , the council 's enterprise chief , said : ' we do n't want people buying chips , eating them outside and then dropping their litter			1
' prevention : the new rules aim to prevent customers from dropping used paper in the street but today , locals spoke out against the ' ridiculous ' rules , which they claimed would ' kill off ' an age - old @entity1 tradition			2
builder @entity48 , 57 , said : ' eating fish and chips in newspaper outside with a simple wooden fork is one of those joys i remember from childhood and have enjoyed with my grandson			1
' why does the council want to be killjoys and take these simple pleasures away ? it makes no sense to me to even be thinking about it			0
' meanwhile , retired nursery nurse june @entity65 , 63 , said : ' it is ridiculous			0
of all the problems with council cut - backs , they are wasting valuable resources thinking about this			0
' and student @entity72 , 19 , said : ' if we are having a night out we just grab the fish and chips and sit down outside and eat it			2
i do n't really want a full plate , knife and fork to be honest			0

@entity106 said : ' we can see the benefits of pavement cafes being there , we just want them to up their standards			2
typically @entity1 : the tradition of eating fish and chips from newspapers has brought joy to millions of families age - old tradition : a family eats the iconic meal out of paper bags while sat on a bench on @entity125 sea front ' it 's all well and good for us to provide litter bins , but at the end of the day there is still a lot of packaging we have to clean up because people just drop it in the streets			1
' if people have a plate and cutlery , this wo n't happen			2
for any new business with a pavement cafe , we are going to make sure they give out plates and cutlery			2
' he said that existing businesses could not be forced to adhere to the new rules - but added : ' we would like all businesses with pavement cafes to start issuing plates and cutlery voluntarily			1
shops : the new rules would apply to businesses with outdoor seating areas in @entity35 ( pictured ) ' the city council 's highways team is currently writing to everyone who has a pavement cafe licence to say " make sure standards are where they should be "			1

the rules follow a major dispute involving the @entity167 fish and chip shop in @entity15 's @entity168 , which was accused of causing a large amount of litter in its outdoor seating area			1
