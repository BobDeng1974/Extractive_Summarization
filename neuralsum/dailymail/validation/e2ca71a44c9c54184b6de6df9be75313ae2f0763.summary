chomping on a piece of gum , arms folded tightly , @entity5 ’s manager looked like a man who was feeling the tension of the day			1
the scene that was unfolding around him , however , was completely at odds with his demeanour			2
in one corner of @entity15 , @entity13 was being mobbed by a group of ecstatic team - mates , while the stands were abuzz with exultant supporters			1
@entity13 had just gracefully and gleefully ensured @entity5 had equalled their biggest win of a bewildering @entity22 campaign , a 3 - 0 slaying of a wretched @entity25 team who finished with 10 men , but , for a second , @entity0 appeared reluctant to embrace the moment			1
@entity29 ( right ) opened the the scoring for @entity5 on sunday at @entity15 and was congratulated by @entity31 @entity33 , having set up @entity29 for the opener , netted @entity5 's second from the penalty spot after @entity31 was brought down @entity13 celebrates after giving gloss to the victory with a stoppage time strike to make it 3 - 0 to the home side at @entity15 @entity5 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity40 7 ; @entity41 7 , @entity42 7.5 , @entity43 6.5 , @entity44 7 ; @entity29 8 ( @entity45 86 ) , @entity46 8 , @entity47 8.5 ; @entity31 7.5 ( @entity48 83mins ) , @entity33 8 ( @entity13 74 , 7 ) , @entity49 7			1
unused subs : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54			2
@entity25 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity56 4 ; @entity57 5 , @entity58 3 , @entity59 5 , @entity60 5 ; @entity61 5 @entity62 4 ; @entity63 4 ( @entity64 46 , 5 ) , @entity65 5 ; @entity66 4 ( @entity67 58 , 5 ) ; @entity68 5 ( @entity69 62 , 6 )			1
unused subs : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74			0
booked : @entity60 , @entity65			0
man of the match : @entity47			0
@entity56 was at fault for the opener , click here for more from our brilliant @entity84			2
soon , though , the magnitude of the result dawned and @entity0 was smiling			0
this was a big victory			0
the spectre of a relegation battle has been tormenting @entity5 during what has been a wretched 2015 but here was a scoreline and a performance to ease tensions			1
@entity29 set the ball rolling , the excellent @entity33 secured the win from the penalty spot and @entity13 provided the gloss when waltzing on to @entity48 ’s pass in injury time			1
true , @entity25 ’s resistance was meek but here was a significant step in the right direction			2
‘ we performed with real desire , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ i thought we were very much in control , and most important of all we played well and wanted to win			2
in the past we have had a fearful approach in not wanting to lose but we showed what we can do			0
we dealt with the extra pressure			0
’ big efforts on a thursday night have tended to zap @entity5 on a sunday and a return of eight points from a possible 24 immediately after @entity117 games has shown what kind of impact progress in that competition has had domestically			2
significantly , @entity0 was able to shuffle his pack and inject some freshness with five changes to the team that had beaten @entity125 ; it worked perfectly			0
the return of @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity31 , especially , made @entity5 a much more vibrant proposition			1
@entity66 breaks away from @entity29 down the wing with the two sides goalless at @entity15 during sunday 's first half @entity66 fights back gallantly as the winger attempted to stop @entity5 's on - loan winger @entity31 in his tracks @entity29 fires in his shot from the edge of the area as @entity58 chases , but the effort found the net and eased @entity5 nerves finding form in the @entity22 has been difficult for the @entity5 who showed their relief in the goal celebrations @entity0 and @entity76 share a laugh on the touchline as their two teams do battle on @entity150 @entity69 , who was again a @entity25 substitute , goes in for a challenge on @entity29 in midfield as @entity25 chase the game a side with more class than @entity25 might have made things more problematic for @entity5 and it would have been interesting to see what had happened if either @entity63 or @entity59 had turned in the respective chances that came their way in the second minute			1
yet that was as good as it got from @entity25			2
acting manager @entity76 argued that his side finished strongly but the reality was they were comfortably beaten and had they returned to @entity166 having lost by six , there could not have been any argument			0
as soon as @entity29 opened the scoring , the outcome was never in doubt , the @entity172 wrong - footing @entity56 from 20 yards after @entity33 had laid @entity42 ’s long - ball into his path			1
@entity56 , really , should have done better but @entity5 were not complaining			1
it was , incredibly , @entity29 ’s first shot on target in the @entity22 for 10 months but it could not have come at a better time , as the relief around @entity15 was almost tangible			1
this stadium can be unforgiving when things are going badly but here they were ready to enjoy themselves			0
being unable to get a second goal before the interval caused a few murmurs but , with @entity25 ’s play becoming more abject by the minute , there was never any sense @entity5 would get pegged back and they ended the contest in the 56th minute			1
referee @entity78 had no hesitation pointing to the spot after @entity62 got into a tangle and upended @entity31 and @entity33 did the rest , rolling his kick into the @entity196 , just as he had done against @entity197			1
the @entity198 had taken 20 penalties in training on wednesday and scored 17			0
@entity25 ’s task was made impossible when @entity58 was dismissed for clattering into @entity31 – @entity76 said he would appeal if he felt @entity25 had a case but when he studies the video , he will realise an appeal would be futile – and that prompted the visiting fans to again barrack @entity206			1
it was another one of those days for @entity25 but @entity76 , to his credit , would not throw in the towel			2
@entity33 steps up to slot home his second penalty of the week after also netting in the @entity117 on thursday night at @entity15 @entity56 dived the wrong way and @entity33 simply had to find the net with his spot - kick , which he duly did to double the lead the big @entity198 forward celebrates after effectively sealing @entity5 's first win at @entity15 of the calendar year on sunday afternoon @entity58 lunges in on @entity31 within three minutes of @entity5 's second goal and is shown the red card by referee @entity78 @entity59 slides in to deny @entity49 as @entity5 surged forward in search of a third goal against their 10 - man opponents @entity13 rounds @entity56 during stoppage time to add @entity5 's third after an impressive performance from the substitutes ' bench ‘ there was a lot of disappointment after the game , usually , we leave them for a couple of days , but i asked the guys if they had anything to say , and two or three did , ’ said @entity76			1
‘ it was sensible , i wo n't name names , but they had something to say			0
there were n't tea cups thrown , they were sensible , and examined it well			0
i ca n't be down			0
i have never thrown the towel anywhere , and i wo n't do it here			0
i want them to be positive			0
’ on this evidence , that will prove easier said than done			0
the @entity248 youngster angles in his shot as @entity25 's defenders and the rest of @entity15 can only watch on as it happens @entity13 celebrates his strike with the @entity150 crowd who were delighted to see their side win at home for the first time this year the @entity25 players applaud the travelling fans who have hung around after the final whistle despite their heavy defeat at @entity15			1

@entity5 were just three points above the relegation zone at the start of play after @entity268 's win on *saturday*
@entity29 wrong - footed @entity56 with his low shot from just outside the area to give @entity5 20th - minute lead
@entity33 doubled the lead with a penalty on 56 minutes after @entity31 was fouled by @entity62
@entity58 was red carded for lunge at @entity31 in the 59th minute as @entity25 fell apart
@entity49 rounded @entity25 *keeper* @entity56 in the closing stages but could not find the net from a tight angle
@entity13 *capped* the win with his second goal of the season during stoppage time with a cool finish
