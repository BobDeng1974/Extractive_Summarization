' and it feels like for me , that was always , like , how you created a legacy was , like , through your children			2
and sort of inadvertently - through sharing my story , i 've realized there 's a bit of the legacy i 'm creating this way and i 'm not ashamed of that			2
i 'm not ashamed to attach my name to what i think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill @entity37			0
' ' i do n't want to die , ' @entity18 explained			0
' if anyone wants to hand me , like , a magical cure and save my life so that i can have children with my husband , you know , i will take them up on it			2
