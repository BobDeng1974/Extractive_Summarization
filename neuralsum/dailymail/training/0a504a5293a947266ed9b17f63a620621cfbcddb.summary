’ a thing of beauty is a joy for ever : its lovliness increases ; it will never pass into nothingness ; but still will keep a bower quiet for us , and a sleep full of sweet dreams , and health , and quiet breathing			0
therefore , on every morrow , are we wreathing a flowery band to bind us to the earth , spite of despondence , of the inhuman dearth of noble natures , of the gloomy days , of all the unhealthy and o'er - darkn 'd ways made for our searching : yes , in spite of all , some shape of beauty moves away the pall from our dark spirits			2
such the sun , the moon , trees old and young , sprouting a shady boon for simple sheep ; and such are daffodils with the green world they live in ; and clear rills that for themselves a cooling covert make ' gainst the hot season ; the mid-forest brake , @entity201 with a sprinkling of fair musk - rose blooms : and such too is the grandeur of the dooms we have imagined for the mighty dead ; an endless fountain of immortal drink , pouring unto us from the heaven 's brink			2
i wandered lonely as a cloud that floats on high o'er vales and hills , when all at once i saw a crowd , a host , of golden daffodils ; beside the lake , beneath the trees , fluttering and dancing in the breeze			0
continuous as the stars that shine and twinkle on the milky way , they stretched in never - ending line along the margin of a bay : ten thousand saw i at a glance , tossing their heads in sprightly dance			2
the waves beside them danced ; but they out - did the sparkling waves in glee : a poet could not but be gay , in such a jocund company : i gazed -- and gazed -- but little thought what wealth the show to me had brought : for oft , when on my couch i lie in vacant or in pensive mood , they flash upon that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude ; and then my heart with pleasure fills , and dances with the daffodils .			2

romantic poets like @entity259 , @entity4 and @entity6 to be studied by all
new 9 - 1 grades to replace a * - g qualifications as part of latest overhaul
