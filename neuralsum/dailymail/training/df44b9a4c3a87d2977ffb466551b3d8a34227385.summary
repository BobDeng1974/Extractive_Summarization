@entity1 @entity0 looked forward to playing alongside @entity2 in the first two rounds of the @entity5 @entity4 here this week and confidently predicted : ’ we ’re going to have some fun and plenty of heated battles in the years to come			1
’ they made a good start on that front last year , when the @entity13 pipped the colourful @entity14 to both the @entity15 and the @entity16 , before wiping the floor with him in a singles match at the @entity19			1
yet the gritty @entity0 is far from daunted , and believes he will win plenty of such tussles himself in the future			1
@entity2 ( second left ) and @entity0 ( second right ) pose during a photoshoot in @entity5 @entity0 pictured during a practice round in @entity5 ahead of the start of the tournament on thursday @entity0 is looking to renew his rivalry with @entity2 during his first tournament in the @entity30 @entity2 posted a picture with @entity0 and the caption ' two best bar men at the @entity34 ' ‘ he may have had some better ball - striking than me at times last year but i do n’t feel like my game is any weaker than his or anything like that , ’ said the 25 year old			1
‘ i ’ve come out on top a couple of times against him and he just happened to come out on top a few more times than me last season			2
’ @entity0 burst back into the limelight last year after a couple of disappointing campaigns			1
he first hit the headlines when he defeated @entity2 in a sudden death play - off to win the 2012 @entity49 and a long rivalry between the pair was predicted , only for @entity0 to fall off the charts			1
armed with a swing rebuilt by @entity54 , that all changed last year as @entity0 finished in the top five in all four majors – the only man ever to achieve such a feat without winning one			2
now he wants to make that final step and win one - and knows he is going to have to get past @entity2 to achieve it			2
‘ to me it feels like we ’re really just at the start and we ’re going to be meeting up an awful lot over the rest of our careers			0
we know how tough he is to beat , and particularly if he is driving the ball like he did through the summer last year			0
make no mistake , he is a great player			0
but i am confident i can win my share			0
’ @entity0 and @entity2 both come from similar backgrounds , so it is perhaps not surprising that this is a rivalry of the most friendly kind			1
both had parents who did extra jobs to give their offspring a chance			0
both were obsessed by golf from an early age			0
the mutual respect that they have was underlined when @entity2 took over as tournament host for the @entity15 at @entity86 in may and @entity0 pledged to come over and support the event			1
@entity2 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity0 ( right ) after an emphatic 5 & 4 victory at the @entity19 in @entity90 @entity2 , pictured during the @entity5 pro-am , has finished as runner - up three times in the tournament @entity2 held off @entity0 to win the @entity15 ( left ) and the @entity16 ( right ) in 2014 this will be @entity0 ’s first appearance in the @entity30 but it will not be his last			1
indeed , he is so enamoured about playing golf outside the @entity1 that he is giving serious consideration to taking out membership of the @entity102 , as well as the @entity103			0
‘ it is definitely something to look at , ’ he confirmed			0
as well as here and the @entity107 , @entity0 is also likely to play the @entity108			2
add in the majors and the @entity110 , and he would only have to add one more event - the @entity112 , for example - to become a member			0
as for the @entity19 , @entity0 is part of the 11 man @entity117 charged with trying to get to the bottom of why @entity1 always loses			1
‘ we ’ve had just one meeting so far but i think getting all of us together and more involved will help us going forward , ’ he said			0
‘ we need to reach the point in two years where we ’re able to put up a better fight and get that @entity19 back on our home soil			2

@entity0 is preparing for first golfing appearance in the @entity30
@entity2 edged @entity0 to wins at the @entity15 and @entity16
he was also beaten 5 & 4 by @entity2 at the @entity19 and wants *revenge*
