by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 , perhaps wisely , chose a low - key way to celebrate his third century in only his sixth test in what became his first win with @entity7			1
‘ i stayed in with a dvd , ’ he said about victory in @entity9			2
‘ it was suggested to us that it might not be the best idea to go out			2
’ it is not difficult to see why			0
the last time @entity19 , 24 , did that , after the drawn first test in @entity18 , he ended up shirtless and the worse for wear in the @entity23 nightclub , shouting ‘ @entity7 , @entity7 , ’ as he was helped out			1
but it is one he responded to , scoring two centuries in the two tests since in what is becoming one of the great introductions to the ultimate form of the game			1
‘ on that first morning at @entity47 ’s i was a bit nervous and embarrassed , ’ he admitted			0
‘ i was under pressure after what happened but that may have been good for me because i put in a performance and proved a few people wrong			0
’ it should be pointed out that the players had been given permission to go out after the @entity57 and @entity2 did not break any team rules , was not out excessively late and did not behave badly to any members of the public			1
yet it was not a good look for an elite sportsman four days before the next test , not least because @entity7 were in the middle of such a dismal run and had very little at that stage to celebrate			1
@entity2 insists he has learnt his lesson			1
‘ i have joked that i had bowled a maiden at @entity70 and wanted to celebrate , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but the timing of it coming out made me feel as if i ’d let the team down the night before @entity74			2
it ’s not what you want from yourself			0
‘ we had been told we could go out and i like to let my hair down a bit at the right times but not in a stupid way			0
i probably had one too many			0
and i ca n’t ever remember taking my shirt off before			0
i was nervous about what my parents would think but they were very understanding			0
i think they have even framed one of the pictures of me ! ’ big hitter : @entity2 recorded his first @entity57 victory in the third match against @entity91 at the @entity92 that night , when pictures that at least confirmed @entity19 has worked on his body shape and fitness emerged , @entity7 captain @entity93 decided to take the @entity98 - born player for a meal to make sure his mind was on the next day ’s job			1
‘ i was n’t told off as such , ’ said @entity2 after being reminded of his responsibilities			1
‘ it was more a slap on the wrist and i was told not to do it again			0
then @entity106 took me out for some food with @entity108 and @entity109 and told me that it can happen and i would be laughing about it in a few days			0
he also said these things are quickly forgotten , but i ’m not sure that ’s the case just yet			0
’ at least his form and @entity7 ’s @entity117 series - levelling win at the @entity92 have turned more attention on @entity19 ’s batting than his drinking			1
he is not an eye - catching performer , but he is proving mightily effective in @entity124 ’s old position of @entity125			2
three hundreds , two further half centuries and 628 runs in total at an average of 62.80 is some going for this adopted @entity131 , especially in a team which before @entity9 had been struggling so much			2
‘ i could n’t have asked for a better start and i really did n’t expect it to go like this , ’ admitted @entity2 , who was asked to bat at three at the behest of @entity134 before the series against @entity136			1
‘ when the coaches back you to bat there it ’s a massive boost because @entity146 has done an unbelievable job there , scoring runs for fun , and they were big shoes to fill			2
stats amazing ! the @entity131 has hit three centuries in his fledgling @entity57 career , with a run average of 62.8 ‘ i feel i ’m batting up there with the best i ’ve ever done , ’ said @entity2 , who was originally approached to join @entity157 by @entity158 after he had spent two years at @entity159 when he first came to @entity7			1
‘ i had a decent start to the county season and i ’m delighted to have brought my form to @entity164			2
’ and now he has his first @entity57 victory , along with five other members of @entity7 ’s third test team , a landmark he celebrated by grabbing a stump as he ran from the @entity92 when @entity91 were defeated			1
‘ the lads gave me some stick for that , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity173 was man of the match and he did n’t get one			0
but i ’ve still got that stump			0
winning is a great feeling after such a tough time			2
’ * @entity117 , the specialist bank and asset manager , is the title sponsor of @entity164 in @entity7			1

@entity2 has learnt his lesson after night of *drunken* embarrassment
the 24 - year - old was pictured drunk and shirtless while celebrating @entity7 's opening draw with @entity91 at @entity70
the batsman has since been in free - scoring form with three centuries
@entity2 celebrated his first test victory after winning at the @entity92
