as the first day of school for the year edges nearer , a teacher and education expert has revealed his top tips for parents who want to make the transition from holidays to day one more bearable for everyone			1
@entity9 from yourtutor.com.au told @entity11 that a routine , an appropriate place to study and the occasional surprise note in a lunch box , can make all the difference to a new start			1
' talk to your child about routines and then get them into one as soon as possible			0
the best way for a student to adapt is to have a routine , ' mr @entity9 said			2
this allows them to relax and disconnect from school			0
then , spend a solid hour or two on homework or study before dinner			0
' @entity52 kindergarten mr @entity9 also suggested that parents buy the tools their children would need for school as early as possible to encourage organisation , but also allow them to pick certain details where possible to make them feel like they have a choice in their experience			1
' prepare resources in advance and contact the school to find out what you need , ' he said			0
' you can make the return exciting by letting them pick their own things like contact for their books or certain pens and pencils			0
' if they 've got a backpack and they want to decorate it - i remember i used to get a felt - tip pen and draw all over my bag - if that 's what they need to do to personalise their stuff , let them do that to personalise their experience			0
' finding the perfect study space that has plenty of natural light and is n't isolated from the rest of the house can ensure that study time is not torture for teens			1
a room with easy access to snacks and water , but free of television and computer screens is perfect according to mr @entity9 , who recommends mixing things up by using the kitchen bench ( where parents are usually available to answer any questions ) or even the balcony or backyard during good weather			1
' despite what most people believe , your home 's traditional study room is not the best space for your child to complete their school work , ' mr @entity9 said			1
he also recommends taking advantage of extra learning resources like local libraries and school tutoring groups as well as encouraging children to join social clubs or sports groups to make friends that can be a great source of support during stressful academic periods			2
he warned parents of new kindergarten pupils to make their goodbyes quick and unemotional and label everything pictured here with his own son @entity131 , who starts school next year , mr @entity9 said : ' the number of parents who drop of their kids and go to the car for a quick cry is immense , but try not to cry at the gate because your kids will get upset as well ' if it 's their first day at a new school or even just the beginning of high school , mr @entity9 said that parents should never underestimate the old fashioned note in a lunch - box			1
' you 'll perk up their day and if they need it , it 's there for them , ' he said			0
parents of new students avoid taking their ' first day ' photos at the school to avoid nervousness for parents who will see their toddlers take on their first ever day at school , mr @entity9 suggested that rather than clinging to their child and saying goodbye in four different ways , parents should opt for a quick and unemotional farewell			1
' the best way is to make a fuss free exit , simply drop your child off , say a quick hello to the teacher and some of the students and make your getaway , ' he said			2
' bring a bag of tissues , but not for the student			0
the amount of parents who drop of their kids and go to the car for a quick cry is immense , but try not to cry at the gate because your kids will get upset as well			0
' i also recommend not sitting outside the school afterwards for ' just in case ' reasons ; if you 're needed , the teachers will call '			0
first - day photographs should be taken at home according to mr @entity9 who says that : ' although it can be super cute to get photos of your child in their classroom ( and on the school oval , in front of the school sign and with the teacher , head teacher and principal ) , it can often distract other children , draw unwanted attention to your own child and make them even more nervous about their big first day			1
' his final piece of advice for parents of new students is to label everything , from lunch - boxes to underpants and even show and tell items			2
' unless you 're happy to fork out for a new school wardrobe every week , you should write your child 's name of every item they take with them , ' mr @entity9 said .			2
