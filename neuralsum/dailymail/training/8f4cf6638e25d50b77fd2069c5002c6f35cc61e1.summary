by @entity0 @entity1 speaking at @entity2 in @entity3 yesterday : the @entity5 's role in the delay of the @entity7 into the @entity8 has been questioned a long - delayed report on the @entity11 war is unlikely to see the light of day until after the next general election , according to well - placed sources			1
despite growing anger over the wait for publication of sir @entity20 ’s investigation into the 2003 conflict , it is now not expected to be ready until early next year			1
@entity23 sources suggest that with an election due in may 2015 , it will be deemed too politically difficult to publish it until after voters have gone to the polls			0
@entity30 strategists are said to be alarmed at the prospect of voters being reminded of the @entity11 war in the months before the election , since the conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters to the @entity37 in 2005 and 2010			1
@entity38 , a former @entity30 attorney general , yesterday called for ‘ clarification ’ on whether @entity1 , @entity40 or the @entity41 were involved in the delay			1
he insisted mr @entity1 must not be allowed to stymie the release of the report – a charge the former prime minister firmly denied			1
sir @entity20 , who was asked to investigate the @entity11 war by mr @entity40 in 2009 , last took evidence from a witness three years ago			1
he warned @entity50 in november that it was ‘ regrettable ’ that a deal could not be agreed on the disclosure of communications between mr @entity1 and @entity55 , the @entity56 president at the time of the @entity11 war			2
the prime minister said he hoped the issues would be ‘ concluded as soon as possible ’			0
but there is speculation in @entity23 that the process of declassifying documents , including mr @entity1 ’s correspondence with president @entity55 before the war , remains stalled			2
it is thought that no one involved has so far received a letter from the inquiry as part of the so - called ‘ @entity75 ’ process – the legal requirement to notify individuals who are criticised in a government - commissioned report			0
one source said : ‘ it ’s certainly not going to be ready before the end of the year and it would be a highly political act to publish in the months before an election			0
the can is going to be kicked further down the road			0
’ @entity1 meets with troops in the port of @entity84 , @entity11 , in may 2003 : @entity30 strategists are said to be alarmed at the prospect of voters being reminded of the @entity11 war in the months before the election @entity38 asked : ‘ who is responsible for the delay ? @entity90 and his colleagues , who must be anxious to publish			1
two past prime ministers – @entity40 and @entity1 ? political dynamite : the investigation by sir @entity20 , pictured , into the 2003 conflict is now not expected to be ready until early next year ‘ a @entity41 fighting to maintain a precedent that @entity41 minutes and discussions between the two previous prime ministers should be permanently kept private ? ‘ @entity99 deserves a clear statement from mr @entity50 as to the reasons for the delays			1
what urgently needs clarification now is where the main hold - up is			0
’ mr @entity1 has insisted that ‘ going back over @entity90 ’ is not going to get @entity107 and its allies out of difficult decisions over intervening in other troubled @entity111 states			2
@entity30 mp @entity112 , who rebelled over @entity11 , claimed mr @entity1 ‘ dreads the publication of @entity114 ’			1
‘ the vote on the @entity11 war was the foulest episode of the @entity1 government , ’ he said			2
‘ the 139 @entity119 who voted on a severe three - line whip against @entity107 involvement were not enough			0
there were 80 other @entity119 who had indicated their worries by their support for amendments and early day motions			0
‘ they were bribed , bullied and bamboozled into voting for war , or abstaining			0
i wonder if @entity1 and the whips ever dwell on the thought that 179 @entity107 lives would not have been lost if they had told the truth and desisted from bellicose bullying			0
