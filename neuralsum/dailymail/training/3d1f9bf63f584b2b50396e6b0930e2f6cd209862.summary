these neon waves lapping gently at the shore may look supernatural , but they are created by one of nature ’s tinniest creatures			0
millions of plankton glowed to light up a beach on the tiny island of @entity8 in @entity9 last wednesday			1
scientists believe the bioluminescent phenomenon is the result of plankton being disturbed , causing them to emit light though a complex chemical reaction			1
@entity32 , who lives in @entity33 , @entity34 , photographed the stunning sight while on a trip with to @entity9			1
‘ after a good half an hour of shooting in the area i was cold and ready to leave but @entity39 [ a friend who appears in the photographs ] decided to have a look for some bioluminescence , ’ he said			0
hands on : organisms such as plankton , fireflies and anglerfish are able to glow by releasing the chemical luciferin , which reacts with oxygen to create light			1
here , @entity32 puts his hands into the water to disturb the tiny creatures , causing them to give off light a haunting spectacle : the amateur photographer from @entity34 had never seen the natural phenomenon before and would have missed it if his friend @entity39 ( pictured ) had n't thrown some small stones in the water , which came to life and glowed bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism			1
it occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates , as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton			0
the word comes from the @entity72 ' bios ' for living and the @entity75 ' lumen ' for light			2
bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction			2
different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways			0
deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light , but @entity90 use it to lure prey with a light - up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish , which they can eat			2
fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens , while their larvae use it to repel predators			0
‘ i 'd never seen it before , but she threw some small stones close to the shore and the ocean came alive - i could n't believe my eyes			0
‘ we went around the corner to an even smaller bay and as we were walking along the beach our feet were leaving shining footprints			0
‘ the concentration of plankton in that small area was so big it looked at times like the water was on fire and was certainly mirroring the sky			1
’ dr @entity123 , a marine biologist at @entity125 's @entity124 , explained : ‘ the light is created by small organisms called plankton , which are producing this light through a complex chemical reaction			1
‘ it 's an example of how organisms have evolved complex responses to external stimulus			0
' he said that late spring and early summer are the best times to see the phenomenon , so it seems that mr @entity32 was lucky to witness the eerie spectacle			1
@entity76 occurs widely among some groups of animals , especially in the open sea and in insects			0
‘ most marine light - emission is in the blue and green light spectrum - the wavelengths that pass furthest through seawater , ’ he said			0
‘ however , some loose - jawed fish emit red and infrared light , and the genus @entity151 emits yellow light			2
‘ sometimes thousands of square miles of the ocean shine with the light of bioluminescent bacteria in the milky seas , ' he said			2
millions of plankton glowed to light up a beach on the tiny island of @entity8 in @entity9 ( marked on the map ) last wednesday spectacular : ‘ the concentration of plankton in that small area was so big it looked at times like the water was on fire and was certainly mirroring the sky , ’ mr @entity32 ( pictured ) said			1

millions of plankton glowed to light up a beach on the tiny island of @entity8 in @entity9 last wednesday
spectacular natural spectacle was *captured* by an amateur photographer from @entity34 who was on *holiday*
he said the eerie glowing sight looked like the ' water was on fire and was certainly mirroring the sky '
scientists believe bioluminescent phenomenon is *due* to plankton being disturbed , causing them to emit light
