@entity0 will never have a better chance of scoring the century that eludes him but on another day of @entity5 domination the captain again fell short of the landmark that would complete his recovery from the darkest days of his career			1
when @entity10 shelled two dollies to reprieve @entity0 on the second day of the final test it seemed certain the cricketing gods had decided the @entity14 was a worthy stage for @entity0 to finally silence any remaining doubts about his form			0
then when @entity30 and @entity31 dropped two of the easiest slip catches you will see when @entity0 was on 65 and 70 @entity10 were looking like an absolute rabble and the @entity19 captain was enjoying a charmed life			1
yet , oddly , @entity0 became less fluent the longer his innings went on and by the time he pushed tentatively outside off - stump and was caught off the hardest of the three chances he offered he was again looking vulnerable to his old failings			0
influential : @entity19 's @entity41 continued his rich vein for form by scoring a sparkling 92 @entity0 would have taken three half centuries in four innings since he and @entity19 hit rock bottom at @entity47 but his failure to cash in when everything was going for him means the wait for his 26th test century now extends to 31 knocks			1
with @entity19 ‘ s next @entity12 not until next april , and with @entity10 ’s frailties meaning @entity0 will probably not get another chance here , that long gap since he took @entity55 for 130 at @entity56 last may will extend to nearly two years			0
the way @entity19 have turned this @entity59 series around means that the pressure has lifted on @entity0 dramatically but the perfectionist inside him would have wanted the icing on the cake that a century here would have represented			2
threat : @entity19 's @entity66 takes evasive action during the second day of the fifth test such has been @entity19 ’s continuing mastery of a deflated @entity10 that it will represent only a minor irritant as long as they go on here to complete their third successive victory after a nightmare run of 10 tests without a solitary win			2
that triumph could come as early as today if @entity10 once again bat as badly as they have done in @entity79 , @entity80 and now here but if it does @entity82 can not really blame an attack that stuck resolutely to its task			0
when @entity0 and @entity87 had taken @entity19 to 191 for one after the early loss of @entity89 , and with @entity10 ’s catching in a state of disarray , the wheels of @entity82 ’s touring bus were close to falling completely off			0
got him : @entity10 's @entity91 celebrates bowling @entity89 of @entity19 for 37 runs yet @entity30 ’s sharp pouching of @entity0 off the persevering @entity91 gave @entity10 an opening to at least reclaim bit of self - respect which they did by taking another three @entity5 wickets while only 38 more runs were being added			2
@entity87 had looked certain to continue his bradmanesque introduction to @entity12 by scoring his fourth hundred in only his eighth test until he unexpectedly jabbed @entity103 to silly mid-off			0
then when @entity105 edged a beauty from @entity107 behind and @entity108 found another sloppy way of getting out , this time deflecting an attempted leave into his stumps , @entity19 were under the slightest semblance of pressure			2
@entity114 in hands : @entity10 's @entity91 shows his disappointment as @entity0 leads charmed life yet any hopes @entity10 had of keeping @entity19 ’s lead down to manageable proportions were quickly snatched away from them by another classy contribution from the young player at the forefront of @entity19 ’s new era			2
there has been much for @entity19 to be cheerful about this summer in the emergence of the likes of @entity128 , @entity108 , @entity66 and @entity129 but it is @entity41 who is developing into the flag carrier for all they hope to achieve			1
ever since @entity19 moved @entity41 to five in the order this year he has left his @entity24 problems behind him , looking much more assertive after beginning the @entity12 summer with a double hundred against @entity136			1
here he once again impressed in tandem with @entity66 , the pair reasserting @entity19 ’s advantage with a stand of 80 , and then when he opened his shoulders in extending @entity19 ’s lead to a commanding 237 in company with @entity129			1
@entity41 had always looked to be positive but as @entity10 flagged towards the end of a second day in which four overs were wasted after seven were left unbowed on friday because of unacceptable over-rates he broke out into a near gallop			0
by the close @entity41 had added 67 off 62 balls with @entity129 and stands just eight short of his fifth test century when he resumes today			0
not only that but he has now scored at least a half century in every test this series and has established himself as absolutely the heir apparent to @entity0 when the @entity19 captain eventually decides to call it a day			1
thanks to the total transformation in this series that day will not now come for a while yet and @entity19 look certain to win this series 3 - 1			1
and that looked barely believable when they were bounced out by @entity107 at @entity47 .			0

@entity41 unbeaten on 92 and @entity19 captain cook scored 79
@entity19 reached *385* - 7 at stumps on second day , a lead of 237
@entity19 lead 2 - 1 in the best of five - match series
