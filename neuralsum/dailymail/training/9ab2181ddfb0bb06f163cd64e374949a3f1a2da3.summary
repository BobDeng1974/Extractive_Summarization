the 25 - year - old @entity17 has come home from @entity8 as a feted , decorated league icon — @entity20 and a man whose c.v			1
now features comic - book heroism in a title - winning cause			2
but under the lights of @entity27 , against @entity28 , he will be a union rookie leaping into the unknown			1
since arriving in the @entity32 last month , @entity31 ’s high - profile recruit has been recovering from facial surgery and undergoing a rapid induction into his new code			1
he has made sufficient progress to be considered for a debut off the bench , amid the maelstrom of an @entity41 encounter			2
@entity12 is preparing to make his rugby union debut for @entity31 on friday night @entity12 has n't played a competitive match since the @entity45 grand final in october after initial fitness work and weight training , several days in the ‘ padded cell ’ at @entity47 gave @entity12 an insight into such alien arts as ruck - clearing and ball - presentation			1
then , as the intensity increased , he realised that although he was fit to play again , he could expect a tough education			2
‘ the only way to test it more now is to play , ’ he said			2
‘ there ’s a lot to take in , but the best way for me to learn is on the field , so i ’ve been pushing to get back as quickly as possible			0
i ’m nowhere near to fully understanding the game yet			0
i ’m still a novice			0
i ’m definitely not going to go out and break records , but hopefully i wo n’t look too out of place ! ‘ i ’m not nervous , but i ’m anxious to see how it goes			0
i ’ve watched so much footage and i just want to have a crack at it			0

so far at @entity31 , he has been getting up to speed with the varied roles of centre and back - rower , though he will be a centre replacement tomorrow night			1
‘ i ’m trying to cover all bases , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t know where i ’m going to play			0
‘ in time , i will find a place which works best for the team			0
i might not be able to do what everyone thinks i can do			0
i might not get the best out of my game at 12 ; that might happen in a different position			0
in time , we ’ll see			0
’ given his profile and reputation , there is huge interest in how @entity12 progresses in union , with the @entity137 looming			1
the @entity72 coaches would like him on board and the fans might eagerly anticipate that scenario , but he faces an arduous transition			0

‘ it was something i really wanted to aim for			0
but since i ’ve got here it ’s just been @entity31 , @entity31 , @entity31 , @entity31 , @entity31			1
i ’ve watched the autumn internationals and i ’d love to be part of them but being here now , i know how hard it ’s going to be to make the conversion			2

' i ’m not writing myself off , i ’m just saying that i now understand how hard these guys work to be doing what they ’re doing			0
i ’ve got so much to learn			0
whether i can do it fast enough , that ’s the challenge			0
we ’ll see what happens , but on friday night , i definitely wo n’t be thinking about @entity72			1
