it was her simple gesture that @entity3 star @entity2 found so heartrending			1
the woman was speaking falteringly about being forced into prostitution in order to feed her children when she broke down , weeping uncontrollably			1
then , as if to hide from the shame , she raised a hand to cover her face			1
in that briefest of moments , @entity2 knew she had found the inspiration for her role as @entity3 ’ tragic heroine @entity15 , who resorts to selling her body for the sake of her daughter			1
@entity2 said : ‘ i just said to myself , that ’s who she is			1
she exists ; this wo n’t be an inventive performance			1
she ’s living in the world right now and i must do the reality of the suffering justice by telling the truth			2
’ indeed , the 30 - year - old ’s empathy with the unidentified woman inspired her to give a performance so remarkable that it has been described as ‘ magnificent ’ and a ‘ tour de force ’			1
two harrowing scenes in particular reveal why her portrayal has been hailed by critics : in one she sings the musical ’s most famous and haunting song , @entity33 , and in the other her hair is cut off live on camera			1
there was a lot riding on the critical reception of the film , which opens in @entity46 cinemas on friday			2
based on @entity48 ’s powerful novel about poverty and revolutionary spirit in 19th century @entity51 , @entity2 was taking on a role which has been played worldwide by some of theatre ’s most established singers			1
yet the actress , who has described portraying fantine as a ‘ dream ’ , more than justified the faith of @entity46 director @entity60 , who cast her over hundreds of better qualified musical actresses			2
@entity60 says he was entranced by the way @entity2 sang in close - up			1
her intensity was in part due to having been fascinated by the musical since the age of seven , when she saw her actress mother , @entity68 , performing in it on stage			2
this emotional connection helped @entity2 to throw herself into becoming fantine with a passion that was unnerving			1
she insisted on her own hair being cut off for the role and , despite @entity60 ’s best efforts to dissuade her , went on an extreme diet to shed 25lb from her already slender frame and attain the emaciated look of the tuberculosis - stricken heroine			1
@entity2 also spent months on her own meticulous library research and would turn up on set carrying binders stuffed with historical papers			1
however , it was watching a current affairs programme on prostitution that truly inspired her virtuoso performance in the film , which also stars @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			2
‘ there was one woman who kept saying , “ i come from a good family , i come from a good family			1
” i just heard the heartache of loss in her voice , ’ @entity2 explains			1
‘ she does n’t know how her life got where it was			2
after having lost everything , she needed to feed her children			2
she burst into tears while she was talking			2
and not just tears , it was soul - racking sobs			2
praise : @entity2 in her role as fantine for which she is hotly tipped to win an @entity113 as @entity113 ‘ i ’ll never forget , even though her face was [ pixelated ] to maintain her privacy , how she raised her hand to her forehead			1
it was the most heartbreaking gesture of despair i had ever seen			2
so , i did n’t leave myself an option not to go there , because to do anything else would be denying the truth			2
’ it was this desire for authenticity that prompted her decision to have her own locks shorn for the scene in which @entity15 sells her hair to buy food for her child			1
@entity2 was clear that she did n’t want to look like a well - groomed @entity133 star pretending to be elegant : @entity2 at the @entity136 premiere for @entity137 showing off her short new hairstyle after she had it cut off during filming abroken woman			1
‘ when i got the role , i had an inherent empathy for the character and a feel for it and a desire to tell the truth in playing her			1
’ yet , she almost changed her mind about her hair at the last minute and found that the tears she was required to shed during filming flowed naturally			1
‘ i was very scared the day we were going to do it			2
i was sort of regretting offering the option to @entity60 [ @entity156 ]			2
‘ after it was done , i looked in the mirror and burst into tears			2
i realised that i could n’t take it back			2
i did n’t think i was that vain			2
’ however , the dramatic cut turned out to be a shrewd move , enabling her to channel her sadness at losing her auburn locks into the scene , and also giving her a sophisticated new look			1
@entity2 has always been canny about her career decisions			1
in the 12 years since she burst on to the scene as a fresh - faced , haphazardly dressed teenager in @entity173 , she has worked hard to be taken seriously			0
her profile grew steadily thanks to a starring turn in @entity176 in 2006 and a steady stream of roles in hits such as @entity180 , becoming @entity181 and @entity182			0
yet , after years of playing wide - eyed ingenues , fantine represents a breakthrough role for the actress , capping a year in which she has turned 30 and married actor - turned - jeweller @entity188			0
she is hotly tipped to receive the @entity113 at next month ’s @entity189			0
explaining the personal significance of the role , @entity2 recalls being enthralled when her mother @entity68 performed in the musical			1
‘ i was seven when i first saw the stage production			0
my mother was playing the factory girl and different members of the ensemble			0
i can remember that pretty well			0
‘ the whole story was very real for me			0
it never felt musical or like it was a group of actors playing a group of characters			0
i felt for them so deeply , even though i was very young			0
’ the evening her mother stepped in as an understudy to play @entity15 is etched on her memory			0
‘ i really do think that was the night my soul fused with this music			0
never knowing , of course , that it would come back and enter my life in the way that it has			0
i always kind of thought that this was [ her mother ’s ] role and untouchable , but when i found out that it was the only one i was up for , i just thought ok great , then i want to play fantine			0
’ her commitment to the character has , in turn , had a profound impact on her personal life			0
she was so happy in the company of @entity188 , then her boyfriend , that she struggled to evoke the misery she needed to project as fantine			0
‘ he walks into a room , and i light up			0
i ca n’t help it , ’ she says			0
so , a few days into filming , she made the heart - wrenching decision to tell him they had to be apart during filming			0
yet there was never a time when she did n’t believe they were destined to be together			0
‘ i knew from the second i met him that he was the love of my life , ’ she gushes			0
the couple started dating in november 2008 , just five months after the end of her disastrous romance with @entity247 businessman @entity246			0
@entity2 broke up with @entity246 , her boyfriend of four years , days after he was arrested on fraud and money - laundering charges			1
family portrait : @entity2 with her actress mother @entity68 who she watched perform in the stage production of @entity137 as a child @entity2 ’s diaries were seized by @entity257 agents looking for evidence , but she did not face any charges			1
@entity246 , who was subsequently convicted and recently released after four years in a @entity261 prison , has since claimed they were about to get engaged when he was arrested			0
@entity2 maintains a dignified silence , choosing instead to focus on her happy new life			1
she reveals that her wedding to @entity188 was influenced partly by her dramatic hairstyle change			1
he was so shocked when he saw her new look for the first time that he blurted : ‘ ok , without giving anything away about what is coming in the next few months , how do you feel about being a short - haired bride ? ’ they were married in a secret ceremony in @entity277 , @entity278 , last september , after filming had ended			0
@entity2 ’s gown , which she wore with a white headpiece and veil , was designed by @entity283			1
with her career and personal life at an all - time high , @entity2 is thinking about motherhood			1
‘ i have wanted to be a mother since i was 16 , ’ she says			0
‘ but i also wanted to have a career , so i have been chomping at the bit to be a mother for a really long time			0
i also had to find a baby daddy first			0
’ now that she has the right man , she is planning a large family			0
‘ i ’d like to have as many as i can afford , not just financially but in terms of time , because you want to make sure that each one feels special			0
i ’d like to have a few naturally and adopt. ’ first , though , she is set to star in @entity300 ’s sci - fi thriller @entity298			0
and before that is the announcement on thursday of this year ’s @entity189 nominations			0
should she go on to win the award as widely expected , amid the jubilation and glamour @entity2 will no doubt reflect on the fate of a desperate , unnamed woman whose selfless sacrifice and palpable suffering spurred her to give the performance of a lifetime .			1
