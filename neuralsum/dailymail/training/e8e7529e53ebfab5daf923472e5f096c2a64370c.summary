' close : sir @entity2 tenderly places his arm around @entity28 as they explain how important it is for fathers to let daughters make their own life decisions @entity28 adds : ' i completely agree			1
if every father can empower their daughter to do exactly what they want and what their passion is , that 's exactly what i did			2
