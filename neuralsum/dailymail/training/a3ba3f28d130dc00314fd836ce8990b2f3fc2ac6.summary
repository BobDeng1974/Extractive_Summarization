as @entity1 near the end of their one - day series in @entity4 , and with the @entity5 less than two months away , there remain as many questions as answers			1
here are a few – less obvious ones – to be getting on with … why does @entity9 not face the first ball of the innings ? on the first day of the tour against @entity14 , @entity12 played out a maiden at the start of @entity1 ’s run - chase			1
in the next over , @entity9 hit six fours			1
a decision should have been made there and then to give @entity9 first strike			1
when i asked a member of the dressing - room why this was n’t happening , he raised his eyebrows as if to consider the question , and replied : ‘ yeah , i do n’t know			2
’ the folly of slowing down the innings almost before it had started was exposed – almost cruelly – during the first one - dayer , when @entity32 twice won lbw shouts against @entity12 in the first over			1
@entity12 successfully challenged both , but @entity1 ’s policy was being made to look ridiculous			1
and guess what ? it was a maiden			0
@entity9 should face the first ball for @entity1 and be allowed to attack from the start why was @entity39 dropped ? there was at least some logic to leaving out @entity1 ’s best one - day spinner in @entity43 , and it was backed up by a five - wicket victory			1
but to omit @entity39 for the next match , on a dry turner at the @entity47 , felt too clever by half			0
@entity1 said they wanted to have another look at @entity50 , as if his rock - bottom confidence was going to stage a miraculous recovery in a single game ( in the event , he made six and bowled two overs for 21 )			1
they also argued , in private , that @entity39 had n’t turned it much during the second match , also at the @entity47			0
but , while @entity4 ’s spinners picked up nine wickets in that fourth game , a @entity58 @entity1 lacked any sense of threat			2
what this team needed after pulling one back in @entity43 was to win again and engender some self - belief			2
instead , they left out their best spinner on a bunsen			0
@entity39 is @entity1 's best odi spinner and should be in the side , especially on turning tracks why was @entity73 not tried at @entity74 from the start ? @entity73 should be part of @entity1 's top three ok , ok , he should have been opening with @entity9 , but @entity1 were n’t budging on @entity12 , so first drop was @entity73 ’s only option			1
but the selectors went for @entity81 , who is their best @entity82 batsman but has never really cracked the one - day malarkey			2
by the time the penny dropped , @entity73 was a man under more pressure than he should have been			0
@entity1 had discerned various technical ailments during his four one - dayers against @entity88 at the end of the summer , whereas most observers reckoned the more salient point was his ability to destroy world - class limited - overs attacks			1
he was iffy in @entity43 , then nicked a half - volley first ball at the @entity47			2
his part in the run - out of @entity9 , plus a dropped catch at third man , did little to dispel a suspicion of occasional doziness			1
but it feels all too @entity102 to worry about what might go wrong			0
and @entity73 will , sometimes , go very , very right			0
why do @entity1 keep bowling wides ? in the warm - up game at the @entity106 , @entity1 sent down 14 wides in 43 overs			1
ah , a bit of rust , we thought			0
they ’ll sort it out			0
the first six one - day internationals produced 64 in wides , compared with 25 from @entity4 ( by contrast , @entity1 have bowled only one no - ball , @entity4 five )			1
once or twice , the umpires ’ interpretation of what constitutes a wide has not always favoured @entity1			2
generally , the malaise has been two - pronged : misdirected bouncers , and leg - side indiscipline			2
a list of the miscreants ahead of today ’s seventh one - dayer : @entity128 12 wides , @entity9 10 , @entity129 10 , @entity130 , @entity131 7 , @entity132 7 , @entity50 6 , @entity39 3 , @entity133 2			1
why does n’t @entity133 bowl more ? for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on @entity138 : @ the_topspin going into tuesday ’s final match in @entity140 , @entity133 was @entity1 ’s meanest seamer in this series , with an economy - rate of 5.46 ( which tells its own story )			1
yet he had been given 15 overs in six matches , and never more than four in one			0
@entity12 plainly does n’t trust him			2
what on earth has happened to @entity148 ? if the @entity148 who hit 62 in 47 balls during the fourth game turns up at the @entity5 , @entity1 will have a sniff			1
if it ’s the @entity148 who has otherwise scraped together 24 runs in five innings , they are doomed			0
there is a theory that @entity148 is at his best a ) when @entity1 are chasing , and he has a goal to aim for , and b ) when , batting first , he does n’t need to rebuild an innings			1
but these conditions do not always apply			0
@entity148 says he neglected his own game while the new back - room staff bedded in at the start of the summer , and admits he was out - thought by @entity88 ’s bowlers at the end			0
whatever the reason , his decline has been one of the most alarming aspects of @entity1 ’s one - day cricket since they returned from @entity171			1
@entity148 ( left ) knows what 's coming as @entity173 successfully appeals in the sixth odi why can no one mount a convincing case for the leadership of @entity12 ? he ’s the captain			2
it ca n’t be that hard			0
@entity179 , the managing director , had a crack on monday evening , even while admitting the selectors had thought long and hard at the end of the summer about @entity12 ’s presence in the one - day team			1
@entity179 made the best case yet : @entity12 emerged from the test win over @entity88 as the leader of a dressing - room that was fully behind him , and experienced openers will be needed against two new balls in @entity171 and @entity191			1
the trouble was , his explanation will continue to lack conviction while @entity12 is failing and @entity1 are losing			1
the selectors have dug themselves into a hole			0
now they ’re reduced to crossing their fingers about a way out			0
@entity12 has had a horror series but @entity1 have stuck with him as @entity174 captain whither @entity50 ? the buccaneer who slammed 164 for @entity203 in the semi-final of the @entity205 against @entity206 has lost his way in @entity1 colours			1
oh my century at @entity210 and my six - for at @entity211 long ago … some of this is self - inflicted ? he never regained his international equilibrium after breaking a wrist punching a locker in the @entity217 in march			0
but what exactly is his one - day role for @entity1 ? no 8 seems too low , while fourth - and fifth - change ( which is what he was in his two games here in @entity4 ) felt like a slap in the face			1
but he needs a defined role – and a bit of @entity230			0
@entity50 is low on confidence and does n't seem to have a defined role in the @entity1 side @entity234 last week we asked you how many @entity239 games @entity237 lost by an innings in 2014			1
as everyone appeared to know , the answer was eight			0
but there could be only one winner			0
congratulations to @entity246 of @entity247 , who will be receiving a full set of all eight editions of @entity250 , @entity252 ’s cricket quarterly			0
special bundles of all eight editions of @entity250 can be ordered here - and are guaranteed delivery by @entity255 - if they are ordered before midnight tonight " http://www.thenightwatchman.net/news/give-the-gift-of-the-nightwatchman-this-christmas @entity257 to live or die by the sword ? a few days on from @entity88 ’s heroic failure in @entity260 and this column is still torn			0
it was great that @entity263 urged his men to go down swinging : as a subconscious up - yours to the sterile cynicism of @entity269 ’s leadership , it was hard not to love			0
but once @entity271 and @entity263 had fallen in quick succession , it did n’t need @entity269 to tell you that the only reasonable option was to go for the draw			0
and if @entity269 ’s return means @entity88 revert to their cautious ways abroad , it may all come to nothing anyway			0
@entity263 ( right ) urged his @entity88 players to go down swinging against @entity171 in @entity260 no escape for @entity12 @entity12 has repeatedly made a virtue of his absence from social media , where he is not exactly flavour of the month			2
but the newspaper shoved every morning under the doors of the @entity1 team here in @entity140 – the hopelessly pro-government @entity288 – may be harder to avoid			2
according to this morning ’s edition , @entity4 ‘ must continue to go hard at @entity12 ’s @entity291 and make them fly back with greater embarrassment and humiliation by winning the final bash ’			2
not only that , but @entity12 ’s dropping of @entity298 on 41 during the sixth one - dayer in @entity299 was a ‘ @entity300 ( up ) for @entity1 ’			1
with puns like that , who needs enemies ? @entity12 leads @entity1 out in @entity140 ahead of the seventh and final one - day international against @entity4 wot no @entity304 ? monday night and an enjoyable q&a with some of @entity1 ’s travelling supporters staying in @entity307 , about an hour north of @entity140			1
these occasions are always fascinating , not least because they provide a sense of what ’s bothering the average fan			0
and so , in about an hour of chat , with guests encouraged to ask any cricket - related questions they wanted , we discussed @entity317 , @entity1 ’s death bowling , @entity12 ’s captaincy , @entity131 ’s yorkers , the @entity5 , @entity148 ’s struggles and the effect of the @entity324 deal on the sport ’s place in @entity328 society			1
not once did the subject of @entity304 crop up			2
i say this not as evidence that no one cares – plenty do			0
but we should be careful not to confuse the anger of some with the indifference of others .			0

@entity9 should face the first ball of each innings for @entity1
someone in the @entity1 camp must be able to defend @entity12
what has happened to @entity50 - and why does n't he have a role ?
@entity1 fans do n't seem to feel need to discuss @entity304
