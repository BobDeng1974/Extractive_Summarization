most women know them well : irritability , cravings , fatigue ... the ugly , tiresome side effects that precede their period			2
while many of us have accepted what seemed like the inevitable every month and suffered through them armed with an arsenal of painkillers , hot water bottles and chocolate ( while those nearest and dearest to us run for cover ) , one doctor claims that our @entity19 can be banished forever with just a few simple steps			1
' @entity19 symptoms such as irritability and cravings are common , but they 're not normal , ' dr @entity21 tells @entity25			1
' at 34 , @entity39 was a bubbly , energetic person			2
she was happily married with two school aged children , and worked three days per week as a dental hygienist			2
" i feel well most of the time , " she told me			2
" but then , five days before my period , everything changes			0
i suddenly feel headachy and fatigued			0
i get snappy with my husband and my kids , and i ca n't seem to stop myself			0
" happy days : the naturopathic doctor says that @entity19 can be banished for good by adapting an anti-inflammatory diet ' i ordered some blood tests for @entity39 , and found that her hormones were normal , which is typical for @entity19			1
some doctors would offer the birth control pill at this point , but i know there 's a better way			0
' i asked @entity39 to stop eating desserts and deep - fried foods			1
@entity39 also took the nutritional supplements magnesium and vitamin @entity62 , and within the very first month , she noticed a dramatic change			2
" i was surprised when my period just arrived , " she said			0
" i did n't even feel it coming			0
" that 's why i love treating @entity19			1
it responds so well to natural treatment			0

gluten - free almond and orange torte made with half the sugar dr @entity21 explains that @entity19 has often been dismissed as a myth in the past , but that new research has indicated a link between inflammation and @entity19			1
' @entity19 has been a controversial diagnosis because researchers have not been able to detect any difference in the blood levels of hormones of pms - sufferers compared to non-pms - sufferers , ' says dr @entity21			1
' in both groups , oestrogen and progesterone levels rise and fall throughout the month just like they 're supposed to			0
' that has led some researchers to dismiss @entity19 as a myth , but i see it another way			1
hormonal : @entity19 is caused by your response to the drop in hormones , which depends on the health of your hormone receptors ... a primary cause of unhealthy receptors is chronic inflammation ' of course @entity19 - sufferers have normal hormone levels			1
that 's because female hormones are not the actual cause of @entity19			1
why did we ever think they would be ? neither oestrogen nor progesterone are inherently bad for mood			0
they 're both beneficial for mood because they boost neurotransmitters such as serotonin			0
' i 've worked with thousands of @entity19 patients , and i 'm convinced : @entity19 is not caused by hormones , or even by the drop in hormones ( which is inevitable at the end of the menstrual cycle )			1
instead , @entity19 is caused by your individual response to that drop in hormones			1
dr @entity21 has been a naturopathic doctor specialising in women 's health for 20 years ' this is where it gets interesting			1
your response to hormones depends on the health and resilience of your hormone receptors , which are the tiny docking stations for your female hormones , and are found in every tissue , including your brain			1
' your hormone receptors translate hormonal messages into real physical effects such as mood or appetite			1
' when your receptors are healthy , they 're flexible , and they adapt to rising and falling hormone levels by simply dialling up and dialling down their response ( depending on the level of hormone )			1
' when your receptors are not healthy , on the other hand , they can not adapt to changing hormones , and that leads to premenstrual symptoms			2
' fortunately , we know what impairs the health of hormone receptors : chronic inflammation			1
according to a recent study , blood markers of inflammation are higher in pms - sufferers			1
chronic inflammation is a kind of long - term immune activation that is caused by different things including stress and smoking			1
it 's also caused by certain inflammatory foods , and that 's why diet is so effective as @entity19 treatment			1
' off the table : deep fried and sugary foods are the most inflammatory , and therefore should be avoided @entity262 the most inflammatory foods are deep - fried foods and high - sugar foods such as desserts and sweet drinks , so you should avoid those			1
you should also avoid fruit juice because it is concentrated sugar			0
@entity274 and deep fried foods are inflammatory for everyone , but other foods , such as wheat and dairy products , can also be inflammatory if you have a sensitivity to them			1
food sensitivities are well known to cause symptoms such as sinus or eczema , but they are also a common cause of @entity19			1
try avoiding wheat and dairy for three months , and see the difference			0
if in doubt , speak to your doctor or nutritionist			2
tip : @entity19 is a common symptom of food sensitivities			2
eat the rainbow : brightly - coloured fruits and vegetables such as berries , spinach and kale provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium eat more anti-inflammatory foods the foods that actively reduce inflammation are fruits and vegetables , especially the brightly coloured ones such as berries , spinach , and kale			1
fruit and vegetables are anti-inflammatory because they provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium , and because they provide phytonutrients			2
phytonutrients are beneficial plant compounds that stimulate your immune system and to reduce its inflammatory response			2
supplements : dr @entity21 recommends mineral magnesium and vitamin @entity62 to supplement diet supplement with natural @entity321 my favourite anti-inflammatory nutritional supplement is the mineral magnesium			1
together with vitamin @entity62 , magnesium has done extremely well in clinical trials for premenstrual syndrome			0
both supplements are safe and easy to obtain			0
tip : the no - more - @entity332 works to prevent @entity19			1
please follow it during all the days of your cycle - not just when you 're premenstrual			2
@entity21 is a naturopathic doctor with nearly 20 years experience in women 's health			1
she 's just released her new book @entity338 : @entity340 .			0

no - more - @entity19 diet consists of anti-inflammatory foods and nutrients
the eating plan was *devised* by naturopathic doctor @entity21
research indicates that @entity19 is caused by unhealthy hormone receptors
health of hormone receptors is impaired by chronic inflammation
stress , smoking , and eating certain foods are all causes of inflammation
cutting inflammatory foods can result in dramatic *improvement* in @entity19
