by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 08:54 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 12:39 est , 22 march 2012 @entity3 are the fastest growing race group in the @entity5 , reflecting a surge in immigration from the entire region over a decade , according to the @entity9			1
data from the @entity11 shows that the number of people who identified themselves as @entity14 alone , and not mixed race , grew by 43.3 per cent from a decade earlier			1
that was more than four times faster than the rate of growth for the overall @entity5 population , which grew 9.7 per cent in the same period to 308,745,538			1
breaking it down : the circles on each state in the map above provide a visual to show how many @entity3 are in each state relative to one another			0
the colors show the country of origin of the majority of the @entity3 in the given state			0
@entity32 , the pink shading , is an ethnic group that exists in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			0
some 14.7 million people - the equivalent of 4.8 per cent of the country ’s total population - identified themselves as @entity14 alone			1
another 2.6 million , or 0.9 per cent , said they were @entity14 in combination with another race group , most commonly white			1
in spite of the documented growth , @entity3 still do n't make the top three biggest ethnic groups in @entity5 : whites are first with 72.4 per cent , then @entity49 with 16.3 per cent and @entity50 are third with 5.6 per cent			1
‘ net international migration is the biggest component of the change in the @entity14 population , ’ said @entity51 , a @entity9 spokesman			2
breakdown by self - identification : the pie charts shows how people defined themselves when asked to explain their origin by the @entity11 ( right ) and how that changed since 2000 ( left ) for statistical purposes , the @entity5 defines an @entity14 as someone ‘ having origins in any of the original peoples of the @entity64 , @entity65 , or the @entity67 subcontinent			1
’ those who identified themselves as either @entity14 alone or @entity14 mixed with another race grew by at least 30 per cent in all states except @entity73 , where they already made up a majority of the population			1
across the board , every state had an increase in growth of their @entity14 population			1
states with the fastest rate of @entity14 growth were @entity86 ( 116 per cent ) , @entity87 ( 95 per cent ) and @entity88 ( 85 per cent )			1
@entity89 had the biggest @entity14 population with 1.1 million , followed by @entity91 ( 484,000 ) and @entity92 , @entity93 ( 327,000 )			2
a map provided by the @entity9 shows that while @entity3 from different home countries have spread throughout the country , it also shows that they tend to move to states near one another			0
the fact that @entity100 tending toward the south and @entity102 gravitating towards the @entity103 is not surprising as it is comforting to be in an area with a large community of your peers			0
the only home country whose descendants spread in a seemingly random manner was that of the @entity35 ; @entity89 has by far the largest population of the ethnic group , but then their only other appearances are in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			2
a larger minority : @entity3 now rank as the fourth highest ethnic group in the @entity5 the types of jobs available in certain regions are thought to be one of the most significant explanations for the continued growth of @entity14 populations in areas like @entity131 and @entity132			1
' there is a constant need for highly skilled workers here , and you have excellent universities with high - tech concentrations in @entity140 and @entity35 that feed that , ' said @entity142 , the @entity131 census steering committee chair			0
' there are also needs in the pharmaceutical , biotech and health industries that fuel @entity14 immigration , much in the same way the agricultural industry fuels @entity153 immigration , ' he told the @entity154			2
the quality of education is also a factor , as @entity3 are one of the best - educated ethnic groups			0
' there definitely is a connection @entity14 people have to education and raising your children well - just as all @entity50 strive for , ' mr @entity142 said			1
@entity35 was the largest of all @entity14 groups ( four million , including 700,000 who identified as mixed race ) , followed by @entity102 ( 3.4 million ) and @entity100 ( 3.2 million )			1
total number of @entity3 in @entity5 : 17,320,856american population overall : @entity67 : 3,183,063 largely concentrated in the @entity65 section of the country , @entity100 have become much more visible in @entity5 politics in recent years			2
the governors from both @entity175 and @entity176 are of @entity67 descent			0
aside from the south , there are also large @entity67 populations in @entity89 , @entity181 , and @entity182 : 4,010,114the largest population of @entity3 of @entity35 descent is unsurprisingly in @entity89 , as @entity89 alone is home to 445,145 @entity35			0
the city 's @entity186 district is said to be the oldest enclave of chinese outside of mainland @entity35 and it dates back to the 1840s			0
@entity102 : @entity192 map shows that the @entity102 population is largely concentrated in the @entity103			0
tellingly , @entity194 has more @entity102 than any other place int the country			0
@entity198 , however , in the @entity197 , holds the title for the largest number of @entity102 in one city , @entity32 : @entity202 is an ethnic group tat comes from the mountainous regions throughout @entity36 , @entity35 , @entity37 , and @entity38			2
their origin dates back 2,000 years and started in @entity35 but began to migrate south in the 18th century because of political instability			0
@entity5 has the largest population of @entity32 people outside of @entity65 , and even beats out @entity38 for the title			1
@entity213 : 1,737,433concentrated in the center of the country and the gulf coast , the states with the most significant @entity213 populations are @entity176 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220			0
