by @entity0 published : 03:00 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 04:27 est , 4 november 2013 failing to report allegations of child sexual abuse should be made a criminal offence in @entity4 , the former director of public prosecutions said			1
@entity6 believes it is time to ' change the law ' and said it should be ' mandatory ' to report allegations in the wake of the @entity13 scandal			1
speaking on @entity14 , mr @entity6 said : ' i think the time has come to change the law and close a gap that 's been there for a very long time			1
i think there should be a mandatory reporting provision			0
calling for change : the former director of public prosecutions @entity6 , pictured on @entity14 , has called for failing to report allegations of child sexual abuse to be made a criminal offence ' the problem is if you have n't got a central provision requiring people to report , then all you can do is fall back on other provisions that are n't really designed for that purpose and that usually means they run into difficulties			1
' what you really need is a clear , direct law that everybody understands			2
' mr @entity6 told the programme he has spent a lot of time thinking about how the criminal justice system could improve its response to child sexual abuse			1
' i went to @entity45 to see how the specialist teams there deal with it , ' he said			0
' they do have a mandatory reporting scheme , a very straightforward , simple scheme and something like that i think could work in this country			0
' abuse lawyer @entity55 , of @entity56 , who represent more than 70 of @entity13 's victims says it 's vital lessons are learned from the case			1
she said : ' the @entity62 scandal has prompted a welcome shift in attitude towards child abuse - but there is so much more that needs to be done to make sure evil like this can never prosper again			1
' it is vital lessons are learnt and our clients are determined that something positive comes out of the terrible abuse they suffered			2
' looking for clarity : mr @entity6 told the @entity14 programme that a new clear and direct law is needed she added : ' since the @entity62 scandal some steps have been taken to assist victims through the difficult process of reporting abuse and the criminal trial process - but now the government needs to act in a more positive way to make sure the silence that surrounded @entity13 and allowed his horrific abuse to go unreported can never happen again			1
' we are now calling on the government to introduce legislation whereby those in regulated activities who have direct knowledge of abuse and fail to do the right thing and report it will face prosecution			2
' this will better protect people in the future			0
we owe this reform to the victims of abuse who have been failed in the past but remain courageous enough to speak out now			2
' the @entity105 coalition also called for the reporting of child abuse to become mandatory			0
@entity112 ( @entity111 in @entity113 ) , @entity114 , respond , survivors @entity108 and @entity109 in @entity110 are calling for mandatory reporting to be introduced in schools and similar institutions , where children are cared for in loco parentis			0
scandal : the suggested law change comes a year after the @entity13 revelations @entity123 , a @entity105 campaigner , said : ' time after time we hear that head teachers and other professionals have failed to act on reports and concerns , and little is ever done to address this very serious shortcoming			1
' @entity130 also need legal protection from the recrimination which can so easily follow when a person takes the courageous step of reporting a concern			0
' however , the government currently has no plans to change the law - with the @entity139 stating that mandatory reporting is ' not the answer '			2
a spokesman said : ' guidance is already crystal clear that professionals should refer immediately to social care when they are concerned about a child			0
' other countries have tried mandatory reporting and there is no evidence to show that it is a better system for protecting children			0
' in fact there is evidence to show it can make children less safe			0
