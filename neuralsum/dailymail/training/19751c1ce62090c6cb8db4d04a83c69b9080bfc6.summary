it 's usually invisible to the naked eye , but @entity3 ’s latest ultra-high - resolution computer model shows plumes of carbon dioxide swirling and shifting across the globe			1
the visualisation provides a fascinating look at how gases in the atmosphere build up , and travel over the course of a year			1
in the video , a year of data is compressed into just over three minutes , revealing concentrations dipping during the spring , and peaking when winter hits			1
it shows the differences between carbon dioxide levels in the northern and southern hemispheres			1
colours represent the concentration of carbon dioxide , from dark blue to pink it was produced by a model called @entity33 , created by scientists at @entity3 's @entity21 ’s @entity20 and @entity22			1
the simulation also shows the differences between carbon dioxide levels in the northern and southern hemispheres , plus distinct swings in global carbon dioxide concentrations as plants and trees grow and change with the seasons			1
the visualisation was created using a simulation called a @entity44			1
the @entity44 uses data on atmospheric conditions and the emission of greenhouse gases , from both natural and man - made sources			2
they may only be tiny , and live for just three months , but ants could be the key to solving climate change			0
rough harvester ants have been found to ‘ weather ’ minerals in sand to produce calcium carbonate , also known as limestone			0
when the ants make this limestone , the process traps carbon dioxide in the rock , ultimately removing it from the atmosphere			1
it is unsure how the minerals are converted , however , and theories range from ants licking the sand , to excreting the substance			0
the discovery was made by professor @entity72 from the @entity73			0
the model is then left to run on its own and simulate the natural behaviour of the @entity77 ’s atmosphere			0
this particular @entity44 simulates january 2006 to december 2006			0
@entity79 scientists have been working with a beta version of the @entity44 for several years , but recently released an updated , improved version for the first time			0
the colours represent the concentration of carbon dioxide , from dark blue to pink - ranging from 377 to 395 parts per million			1
@entity88 represents around 385 parts per million , and plumes shown on the greyscale are carbon monoxide emissions			1
the video is narrated by @entity3 climate scientists @entity95			0
‘ carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas affected by human activity , ’ explained mr @entity95			2
‘ about half of the carbon dioxide emitted by fuel combustion remains in the atmosphere , while the other half is absorbed by natural land and ocean reservoirs			2
‘ in the northern hemisphere , we see the highest concentrations are focused around emission sources over @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
in the northern hemisphere , the highest concentrations of gas are focused around emission sources over @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
during spring and summer , plants absorb carbon dioxide			2
this removes some of the gas , and the model changes from red and purple to green and yellow ( pictured ) ‘ notice how the gas does n’t stay in one place , the dispersion of carbon dioxide is controlled by the large - scale weather patterns within the global circulation			2
’ during spring and summer in the northern hemisphere , plants absorb a substantial amount of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis			2
this removes some of the gas from the atmosphere , and the model is seen changing from red and purple to green , yellow and blue			0
during this time , carbon monoxide ( pictured in grey ) is released in the southern hemisphere , and during the summer , plumes of the harmful gas are released from fires in @entity142 and @entity143			2
these emissions are moved around the globe by the wind			0
as plants die during autumn , carbon dioxide levels begin to rise again meanwhile , carbon monoxide is seen being released in the southern hemisphere , and during the summer , plumes of the harmful gas are released from fires in @entity142 and @entity143			1
these emissions are then moved around the globe by the wind			0
as plants die during autumn and winter , carbon dioxide levels begin to rise again			1
‘ although this change is expected , we ’re seeing higher levels of carbon dioxide accumulate in the atmosphere each year			1
‘ this is contributing to the long - term trend of rising global temperatures , ’ concluded mr @entity95 .			0

the visualisation was created using a simulation called a @entity44
it provides an *insight* into how atmosphere gases travel around the globe
during the video , a year of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide levels are *condensed* into just over three minutes
it reveals concentrations dipping during the spring and peaking in winter
colours represent the concentration of carbon dioxide from dark blue to pink - ranging from 377 to 395 parts per million
plumes shown on the greyscale are carbon monoxide emissions
