by @entity0 and @entity1 fish is off the menu at @entity4 after ‘ dinners ’ served up for the tv series left the stately home reeking – and the actors feeling distinctly queasy			1
mrs @entity9 would no doubt be scandalised but the meals masquerading as fish , camouflaged with white sauce , are now sculpted pieces of chicken fillet which pass muster onscreen without leaving any lingering and distinctive odour			1
@entity17 , the show ’s creator , has been keen that costumes , props and even the food are as historically accurate as possible			0
fowl play : @entity24 and @entity25 tuck in to chicken disguised as fish using white sauce and mushrooms but when real fish was served in the first series , the cast became nauseous , and the rooms were left stinking , according to @entity34 , who plays @entity24			1
‘ in the first season , when we had fish it really was fish , ’ he said			0
‘ but if you put fish on the table at 8am when you start shooting it does n’t smell so good in a few hours			2
' it was pretty bad , especially when we were shooting in summer , with the windows blacked out , pretending it was night			0
' the combination got pretty heady by mid-afternoon			0
since the first season , no clear shots of fish have appeared after the genuine meals left rooms stinking makeover : food stylist @entity54 has a menu of food that is historically accurate but mild in smell ‘ our food consultant is very clever about how she disguises “ fish ”			1
it always looks and tastes delicious , but it is n’t the dish the audience thinks we ’re eating			0
’ @entity54 , @entity4 ’s food stylist , conceded she used a range of tricks to enable the food to taste good , stay fresh , and look appetising			1
‘ the food must be appealing to the eye , historically accurate and well behaved			0
after all , the actors have to eat it , ’ she said			0
late night filming was particularly smelly as they were forced to keep the windows shut ‘ the fish incidents did happen , but outside my watch – i ’ve been working with food and filming for too long to ever use real fish			2
' i prepare “ chicken fish ” – chicken fillets covered in white sauce with mushrooms – to look like fish fillets , and “ cheesy fish ” – cream cheese , cottage cheese and @entity92 sauce and lemon – to replicate the salmon mousse that was so popular once @entity95 worked out how to use the food mixer			1
’ all the food eaten by the servants is real , too , with @entity54 using @entity99 and mrs @entity101 ’s cookery books			2
‘ downstairs characters have more simple fare , but it ’s all real , ’ says @entity54 .			2
