the @entity6 were playing their first game at their home stadium since april 2013 , following a dispute between the stadium 's operators @entity9 and the club owners @entity16			1
the club have been playing 35 miles away in @entity20 , prompting fans to boycott ' home ' games , but they flocked back to the stadium as the first team football returned to @entity6			1
decisive : @entity4 scored after nine and a half minutes on debut to celebrate @entity6 's @entity28 return the first of many : @entity4 celebrates his side - footed strike as the loanee made the perfect debut impact no place like home : @entity6 fans were delighted to be back playing games in their home city @entity6 : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity48 , @entity4 , @entity49			1

referee : @entity82 ( @entity83 ) a massive attendance of 27,306 fans flooded the @entity9 , forcing kick - off to be delayed by 15 minutes as the club tried to ensure everyone could get in			1
and those who were part of the sell - out crowd were rewarded early on , as @entity93 's side responded brilliantly to the home support			1
@entity43 's acrobatic volley in the sixth minute may have lacked power and accuracy , but the attempt , and the football that preceded it , demonstrated purpose , ambition and quality down the @entity6 left , and was a sign of things to come			1
four minutes later @entity4 put @entity93 's side ahead			1
again the move came from the left hand side , @entity47 getting in behind before cutting the ball back to the former @entity111 forwrard , who sidefooted home from eight yards			2
at the other end @entity39 was rarely worked in the first 45 minutes , although @entity47 almost deflected a cross into his own net on the stroke of half time			0
many happy returns : many fans had refused to attend home games during the club 's absence from the city good to be back : scarves celebrating the return from @entity20 were sold outside the @entity9 in control : @entity46 holds off @entity58 's @entity68 as @entity6 dominated the first half feeling sky blue : @entity58 were unable to cope with a @entity6 side lifted by their huge support after the break @entity6 were again on top , and @entity4 almost turned provider for @entity45 on 48 minutes , but the @entity134 could n't make a good enough connection from five yards			1
@entity58 were still on the back foot , but they began to create chances as the game wore on , @entity139 heading over from a corner , and @entity66 bursting past the @entity6 defence into the box , before a poor decision to pass instead of shooting ended the attack			2
@entity6 were still the better side however , and on 65 minutes they almost doubled their advantage , @entity45 's audatious attempt from 40 yards out on the touchline kept out by a combination of keeper and crossbar			1
with fifteen minutes to go @entity93 's men were almost made to pay for failing to turn their chances into goals			1
a free - kick from the left hand side found the head of @entity62 but , under no pressure , he headed well wide			2
winning ways : @entity93 celebrates as @entity4 gives @entity6 the lead after nine minutes proud return : in the end it was over 27,000 fans who packed into the @entity9 to watch @entity6 win back and good : @entity93 salutes the fans after his side secured a 1 - 0 victory in the @entity171 clash and , as @entity93 and the bumper - crowd , began to show their nerves , @entity58 sensed they might leave @entity6 's party with a share of the spoils			1
@entity72 could have earned his side a point , but he fired a difficult volley into the side - netting five minutes from time			2
had it gone in , it would have been a strike worthy of a point			0
then , in the final seconds @entity39 allowed a cross to bobble along the six - yard box , but no - one in a red shirt could turn it home			2
in the end though , @entity6 held on for their victory			2
given the pain of the last seventeen months , you could n't begrudge their happy fans their three precious points			0
@entity93 was clearly proud of the victory and believes the return has finally given the club a platform to progress			2
he said : ' i said all along i have huge sympathy for the supporters because clubs are built around them			0
the return in many respects shows their value to a club			0
they voted with their feet and forced the club to where it truly belonged			0
' i hope it 's not a false dawn			0
we have so much work ahead of us			0
i think we have given people hope and that 's vital			0
' it was an outstanding night and i was exceptionally proud to be the manager of the club , we showed our true potential			0
' i 'm pleased with the result because i have seen many of these scripts before , when we turn up in numbers and everyone expects us to win and we end up with egg on our face			0
