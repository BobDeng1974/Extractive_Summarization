folding bikes may not be new , but this latest model takes the idea a step further by not only adding an electric motor , but making it so small it can fit inside in a bag			2
the impossible bike travels at 12.5mph ( 20km/h ) for 45 minutes on a single charge , and can carry the weight of a 13 - stone ( 85kg ) rider			1
the designers have launched a @entity13 campaign to fund production of the bike , and although they do n’t reveal the exact dimensions or weight of the bike , a video shows it being placed easily in an average backpack			1
it travels at 12.5mph ( 20km/h ) for 45 minutes using 10 @entity29 batteries			1
the brakes are controlled using a button on the handlebars , and the wheels are hollow , but solid unfolding the carbon fibre bike is carried out in four stages			1
it is unlocked , the saddle and handlebars twist into position , the whole bike is pulled up to the correct height , and then frame locks it all into place			1
this height is adjustable and comes with four options - 2.1ft ( 65cm ) , 2.2ft ( 70cm ) , 2.4ft ( 75cm ) and 2.6ft ( 80cm )			2

@entity23 is powered by a @entity50 brushless motor , custom - built by the @entity24 - based design team , and it runs on 10 @entity29 batteries			1

this height is adjustable and comes with four options : 2.1ft ( 65cm ) , 2.2ft ( 70cm ) , 2.4ft ( 75cm ) and 2.6ft ( 80cm ) the designers have launched a @entity13 campaign to fund production of the bike , and although they do n’t reveal the exact dimensions or weight of the bike , a video shows it being placed easily in an average backpack ( screengrab pictured ) an engineer who was told by cyclists that they never wore a helmet because they were ' an inconvenience to carry ' recently came up with a solution - the folding helmet			1
the @entity75 helmet , neatly folds away to a third of its size in small bags			0
it costs about £ 79 ( $ 126 ) and was made by engineer @entity80 , 40 , from @entity81			2
the size of the helmet when folded is 8.3 x 4.3 x 6.3 inches ( 21 x 11 x 16 cm ) , and it weights just 1lb ( 490g )			0
its outer shell is made of @entity86 plastic and the inner shell is made of expanded polystyrene			0
the prototype version travels at 12.5mph ( 20km/h ) for 45 minutes on a single charge , and these batteries take around half an hour to recharge			1
‘ one of our main challenges was choosing an electric motor that would fit our parameters both in terms of power and in terms of weight , ’ said @entity23			0
‘ for the purposes of our proof of concept , we have modified an existing electric motor			0
‘ however , @entity104 will be shipped with a motor completely designed by @entity23			0
’ the bike does n’t have pedals , which means if the battery runs out mid-ride there is no way to power the device			2
the frame is built around circles , instead of a single horizontal girder			0
this ‘ helps to ensure that the bike spreads the weight equally across the frame ’ and the designed said they put the seat and the handle bars at similar heights so that the front and rear wheels would bear the weight of the rider equally			2

this ‘ helps to ensure that the bike spreads the weight equally across the frame ’ a white model ( pictured ) can be ordered for £ 241 ( $ 430 cad ) , a black model costs £ 258 ( $ 480 cad ) but , as the designers explained on their @entity13 page : ‘ the main point of our bike is that it is light and small enough to be folded into your backpack			1
‘ if we add pedals or any other chain structure it will take more space and make it heavier			0
‘ but , they said they are making extra batteries to act as a backup			0
plus , because of the bike 's short charging time , the rider should be able to ‘ fold it into a backpack and walk to a coffee shop to recharge the battery			0
’ designers have already raised more than £ 123,000 ( $ 218,850 cad ) via the @entity13 campaign - achieving almost four times its target amount			1
a white model can be pre-ordered for £ 241 ( $ 430 cad ) , while a black model costs £ 258 ( $ 480 cad )			1
once the campaign ends on 25 december , impossible bikes will be shipped internationally by august 2015 .			0
