for all the talk about how the young @entity2 are going to push @entity3 hard this year , it might be someone closer to home who proves the nearest thing to a rival			1
@entity9 turned 30 on december 28 and will surely emphasise he is a man in his prime by completing an impressive statement of intent in the desert on sunday			1
the final round of the @entity16 @entity15 was shaping up to be an epic duel in the sun between the winners of the last three majors when @entity3 notched his first hole in one as a pro on friday , to pull within two strokes of the @entity24			1
@entity9 holds his ball up to the crowd after sinking a birdie on the sixth hole @entity9 , who leads by six shots , chips out of the bunker on the 10th hole during the third round @entity3 , pictured playing a shot out of the bunker , had a frustrating third round in @entity16 as it was , the traditional ‘ moving day ’ saw @entity9 shoot 65 to set a new 54 - hole tournament record of 20 under par and accelerate six clear of gifted @entity39 , @entity40 , while the world no 1 fired a 71 to be stuck in reverse			1
@entity3 knew where the blame lay for falling hopelessly adrift			1
he did n’t play badly by any means , indeed he only missed two fairways and one green in regulation			0
but his pace on the greens was awry all day			2
‘ i am extremely disappointed , ’ admitted @entity3			2
‘ given how well i struck the ball a 65 or 66 was there for the taking but i missed countless opportunities			0
it was incredibly wasteful , and it looks like i will be playing for second place			0
’ @entity3 , who ended the day tied fifth , plays an approach shot over the water on the 18th hole @entity9 , who shot a seven under par , lines up a putt on day three of the @entity63 the @entity24 cemented his place at the top of the leaderboard during an impressive third round kaymer in conversation with with a rules official after his ball lands in a bush @entity9 tees off on the ninth hole during the third round at the @entity75 going forward , though , there are plenty of positives			1
if truth be told , @entity3 rarely putts well on this course , so from that point of view it ’s been business as usual			2
but he will be enthused by the quality of his ball - striking , which has been right up there with his best days of last year			0
next up is the @entity88 in 10 days , where he has putted well in the past , and so will provide a better opportunity for finding his groove on the greens			0
as for @entity9 , he showed once more that when he ’s playing his best golf he is a match for anybody , including @entity96			2
he just needs to do it more consistently to give the @entity98 a run for his money in the world rankings			0
@entity9 won the @entity102 and the @entity103 during a month - long golden spell during last may and june — but then registered only one top 10 during the rest of the year			1
@entity3 plays his second shot on the fifth hole as he bids to surge up the leaderboard in @entity16 @entity40 of @entity39 hits out of the bunker during his third round in @entity16 the one time he was in serious trouble yesterday came on the par - five 10th			1
he had to take a penalty drop and found himself facing a tricky greenside bunker shot having played four strokes already			0
a double bogey there would have given the chasing pack hope			0
as it was , @entity9 played the sand shot to perfection , holing it for the unlikeliest of pars			1
he did the same thing on the first day , too			0
indeed , on the three occasions he ’s found himself in greenside bunkers in 54 holes , he ’s taken a grand total of four shots to complete the trio of holes			0
@entity2 @entity132 rides a camel following his round at the @entity75 in @entity16 there ’s not much hope for everyone else when someone ’s doing that on the odd occasion they ’re in trouble , is there ? @entity40 coped pretty well with the @entity9 onslaught to post a 70			1
the 22 - year - old big hitter from @entity145 must have learned plenty , and will learn plenty more since he leads the chasing pack on 14 under			2
he will accompany @entity9 today , as the @entity24 completes the seeming formality of a fourth win on this course			0
that , in turn , will take him back into the world ’s top 10 , where he assuredly belongs			0
leader @entity9 signs autographs for fans after completing his third round			1

@entity9 heads into the final round with a six - shot lead
@entity9 hit an impressive seven under - par as he took full control
@entity3 endured a frustrating day on the greens and shot one under
@entity3 goes into final day two shots off second place
@entity40 closed the round on 14 under after a round of 70
