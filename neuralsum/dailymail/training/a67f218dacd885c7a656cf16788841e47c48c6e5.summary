after most of the world 's population is wiped off the map by a wayward meteorite or hail of nuclear missiles , the survival of the human race might just depend on a few thousand people huddled in recreational vehicles deep in the bowels of an eastern @entity12 mine			1
that 's the vision of a @entity15 man who is creating what he calls the world 's largest private underground survivor shelter , using a complex of limestone caves dug more than 100 years ago beneath gently rolling hills overlooking the @entity22			1
' i do believe i am on a mission and doing a spiritual thing , ' said @entity26 , who has purchased a large portion of the former @entity29 storage facility on the southeast edge of @entity31 , about 50 miles northwest of @entity32			2
' we will certainly be part of the genesis			2
@entity60 , president of the @entity61 , said some people think the shelter plan sounds creepy or that @entity26 has ' lost his mind , ' while others are excited because they will finally get a chance to tour the property			1
@entity31 is known as the birthplace of @entity69 and one of the most haunted towns in @entity12 , @entity60 said , so the survival shelter is likely to add to the town 's tourism draw			1
' it 's quirky , and quirky gets attention , ' she said			2
recent @entity79 movies have done big business exploring themes about the human race , either through climate shifts , meteor impacts or zombie invasions			0
and the @entity87 show , ' @entity85 , ' documents the efforts of @entity89 who are preparing for the end of the world with elaborate shelters and plenty of freeze - dried rations			1
protected : a fence helps guard the entrance to the @entity98 and @entity99 leisure time : before being used during an armageddon or a deadly global pandemic , however , the @entity53 will be a fun place for people to take vacations and learn survival skills @entity107 , who belongs to a group that promotes preparing for manmade or natural disasters , said @entity89 have become complacent ever since the death of @entity111 , the last president who urged people to build fallout shelters			0
' there has been no war on our soil in over 100 years , so the horror of war is not stamped indelibly in @entity89 ' minds , ' said @entity107 , a member of @entity122 's advisory board			1
@entity123 , a history professor at @entity124 , is an outspoken critic of underground shelters			2
though he acknowledged that interest in underground shelters is growing , he called projects like the @entity12 facility a ' colossal waste of time and money			1
' ' some people are just obsessed by this idea , ' mr @entity123 said			0
. without minimizing the terror threat here today , the threats were much greater at the height of the @entity138			0
at least then anxiety was based on a realistic scenario			0
' the @entity12 caverns are 100 feet to 150 feet below the surface and have a constant natural temperature in the low 70s			1
owner : @entity146 bought the complex and immediately started looking for ways to use it			0
one of his ideas was to lease the land to a company that builds survival bunkers large : mr @entity146 stands next to a scale model of the @entity155			0
the @entity29 used the caverns for decades as a storage facility before putting them up for auction last year they are supported by thick limestone pillars six times stronger than concrete and will have blast doors built to withstand a one - megaton nuclear explosion as close as 10 miles away , @entity26 said			1
other than being surrounded by more than a mile and a half of 6 - foot - high chain - link fence topped with sharp rows of barbed wire , the land above ground is n't distinguishable from expanses of hills and trees that surround it			2
the proposed shelter 's entrances - nondescript concrete loading docks tucked discretely into the wooded hillside - are easily defensible against any potential intruders provided there 's not a full - scale military attack , @entity26 said			1
the @entity29 used the caverns - created by limestone mining operations that started in the late 1880s - for decades as a storage facility before putting them up for auction last year			1
the winning bid in december was $ 1.7 million , but financing fell through and the site was put up for sale again			0
@entity190 investor @entity146 submitted his winning $ 510,000 bid for the property in early april , and he immediately started looking for ways to use it			0
one of his ideas was to lease the land to a company that builds survival bunkers			0
secure : the @entity12 caverns are 100 feet to 150 feet below the surface			1
they will have blast doors built to withstand a one - megaton nuclear explosion as close as 10 miles away sprawling : mr @entity146 stands next to a map of the @entity98 and @entity99 mr @entity26 , whose company is based in @entity206 , @entity15 , said he received an email from @entity146 and flew to @entity12 two days later to check out the property			1
@entity26 agreed to purchase 75 per cent of the complex , rather than lease it , while @entity146 retained the rest and is marketing it to local businesses			0
the complex consists of two fully lighted , temperature - controlled mines with concrete floors			1
the east cave , which @entity146 owns , encompasses about 15 acres and contains offices , vaults , restrooms and other developed work spaces			0
the much larger west cave , which covers about 45 acres , is mostly undeveloped and will be converted into the @entity53 facility			0
the shelter will have enough space for more than 1,000 rvs and up to about 5,000 people			2
members will be charged $ 1,000 for every lineal foot of their rv to purchase their space , plus $ 1,500 per person for food			0
underground : investor @entity146 drives a golf cart in the darkness of one of the tunnels that means a person who plans to park a 30 - foot vehicle in the shelter with four people inside will pay $ 30,000 for the space and $ 6,000 for food			1
actual sales wo n't begin until a ' critical mass ' of reservations are received and processed , @entity26 said , which has n't happened yet at the @entity12 shelter			1
@entity249 also owns a shelter in @entity251 with room for 80 people to live comfortably for up to a year			2
there , members pay $ 50,000 per adult and $ 35,000 per child , so a family with two adults and two children would have to come up with $ 170,000 to be part of the post-apocalyptic generation			0
purchasers will required to pay for the full balance before taking possession of their shelter space , though the company has offered limited financing in the past with a sizable down payment			2
@entity26 says he wo n't say specifically where the @entity251 shelter or any of his smaller facilities are located because he fears there would be anarchy in the event of a world - changing catastrophe			1
and it does n't matter who comes knocking at the ' moment of truth , ' @entity26 said , they 're probably not getting in			0
' i 've heard people say , " i will just show up at the door , " ' he said			0
' our response is , " great , where is the door ? " at our secret shelters , you do n't know where to go , and your cash will be worthless at that time			0

caves will be ' the world 's largest private underground survivor shelter '
