by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 08:40 est , 24 july 2013 teen sports star @entity1 ditched her tennis whites and showed off her more glamorous side for a night on the town at prestigious haunt @entity6 last night			1
she may only be nineteen but she now one of the most marketable tennis stars after reaching the fourth round at @entity10 earlier this month			1
it is n't just her ball skills that get her noticed ; her personality and looks are also key to her appeal			2
letting her hair down : tennis ace @entity1 was seen leaving @entity6 at 3am leaving her sporty gear at home for the evening , the athlete cut an effortlessly chic figure as she showed off her style credentials in a pair of black shorts , a blue and purple top and smart black blazer			1
the @entity27 - born sportswoman completed her look with a vibrant blue clutch bag , gold jewellery and a killer tan - no doubt acquired during her time on the court at @entity34			0
@entity1 certainly looked like she was making the most of her time away from competition as she looked partied out as she left the famed nightclub at 3am			2
@entity1 's @entity10 dream came to an end last fortnight when she left @entity40 1 fighting back tears after suffering a defeat at the hands of @entity45 @entity44			1
visibly devastated , she said of her loss : ' it is more disappointing because i put so much pressure on myself			0
i had my chances and i just did n’t take them			0
' i have so much to work on before i can even think of getting to @entity52 finals			0

really has been amazing ! ' despite her loss , insiders are predicting her off - court earnings will hit £ 1million because of her nationwide popularity			2
she has already signed up to become the face of @entity76 alongside @entity77			0
the fact that she is a @entity79 player who might one day win @entity10 gives her an appeal way beyond these shores			2
fun times : @entity1 looked like she had enjoyed her night on the town as she left at 3am time for bed : @entity1 hopped into a taxi at 3am to make her way home after enjoying a night out with friends following her hard work on the tennis court last fortnight it is easily forgotten , after the triumph of @entity93 , that while she was in the tournament she garnered as much attention as him			1
she has been working with coach @entity96 this summer and after a post-wimbledon break is preparing for the swing of tournaments in @entity100 , leading into the @entity101			0
now that she is ranked 31 in the world , it is likely that she will be seeded at @entity104 at the end of next month , the first time she has been a seed in a @entity52			0
