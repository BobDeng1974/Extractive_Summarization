by @entity1 reporter published : 19:52 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 08:31 est , 8 june 2013 this is @entity4 , ' @entity5 ' who became the symbol of @entity9 protests after she was tear - gassed by police this is the first picture of the @entity9 academic since she became the unwitting icon of the country 's mass protests after she was pictured being sprayed with tear gas			1
dubbed ' @entity5 ' because she was wearing an elegant red dress when she was gassed , @entity4 has said she is uncomfortable with her fame and has no desire to be a figurehead of the movement			1
' there are a lot of people who were at the park and they were also tear - gassed , ' she told @entity9 's @entity26			1
' there is no difference between them and @entity30 ' nevertheless , pictures have reverberated around the world of @entity33 , an academic in city planning at @entity35 , turning away from massed riot police as one officer sprays tear gas at her face			1
endlessly shared on social media and recreated as artwork on posters and stickers , the image - dubbed ' @entity5 ' - has become the leitmotif for female protesters at recent violent anti-government riots in @entity49			1
but the academic , who is part of the @entity52 protesting against the redevelopment of the park , has shied away from media attention			1
she is believed to be uncomfortable with her position as the focal point of the movement - although her image alone has become a galvanising force for fellow protesters			1
in the early hours of this morning thousands of protesters were digging in for a fresh weekend of demonstrations prime minister @entity65 's demand for an immediate end to the worst political unrest of his decade in power			2
iconic : @entity70 turns her head as a policeman showers her in pepper spray at close range this is what democracy looks like : this combination of photos shows how miss @entity4 first faces off with the massed ranks of riot police before one steps forward to spray the gas right into her face ' there are a lot of people who were at the park and they were also tear - gassed ' : miss @entity4 forced is to retreat coughing and spluttering as the gas - wielding riot policeman goes on to spray others at the protest in central @entity49 's @entity95 , where riot police backed by helicopters and armoured vehicles clashed with protesters a week ago , activists spent the night in a makeshift protest camp			1
they slept in tents and vandalised buses , or wrapped themselves in blankets under the shelter of plane trees			0
what began as a campaign against the redevelopment of @entity110 in a corner of @entity95 spiralled into an massive display of public rage over the perceived authoritarianism of mr @entity65 and his @entity116 - rooted @entity115			2
worst unrest in a decade of power : @entity9 prime minister @entity65 has called on protesters to immediately clear the streets police firing tear gas and water cannon have clashed with groups of protesters night after night in @entity49 , @entity127 and other cities across the country for much of the past week , leaving three dead and some 4,000 injured			1
mr @entity65 yesterday demanded an immediate end to the protests , saying they were founded on a ' campaign of lies			0
' he has branded the demonstrators as looters and has said the protests are being manipulated by ' terrorist ' groups			0
there are rumours that among the liberal protesters there are far - right nationalists who seek a return to the kind of militant secularism that saw @entity9 politics dominated in the 20th century by a string of military dictatorships			1
mr @entity65 gave no indication of any immediate plans to remove the tent villages that have appeared in @entity95 and a park in the capital , @entity127			0
but the gatherings mark a challenge to a leader whose authority is built on three successive election victories			0
' let them attack , they ca n't stop us , ' shouted a member of the @entity9 @entity164 , shouting through loudspeakers to a cheering crowd from on top of a white van in @entity95			1
' the @entity115 will go			0
this will be the end			0
' the protesters have built barricades of paving stones and corrugated iron on access roads to @entity95 to try to protect themselves against a potential police assault			0
but their actions have brought gridlock to part of central @entity49 and it is unclear how long the authorities will tolerate their presence			0
the square is lined by luxury hotels that should be doing a roaring trade as the summer season starts in one of the world 's most - visited cities			2
but a forced eviction could trigger a repeat of the clashes seen earlier in the week			0
during his decade in power , mr @entity65 has enacted many democratic reforms , taming a military that toppled four governments in four decades , starting entry talks with the @entity198 , reining in rights abuses by police and forging peace talks with @entity203 rebels to end a three - decade - old war that has cost 40,000 lives			2
a gay rights activist holds a sign as he protests near @entity95 in @entity49 last night : in the early hours of this morning thousands of protesters were digging in for a fresh weekend of demonstrations occupy : in central @entity49 's @entity95 activists spent the night in a makeshift protest camp			0
they slept in tents and vandalised buses , or wrapped themselves in blankets under the shelter of plane trees a advertising hoarding is covered in graffiti as people gather at @entity95 yesterday evening : mr @entity65 yesterday demanded an immediate end to the protests , saying they were founded on a ' campaign of lies ' @entity9 women stand near political signs at @entity95 : protesters have built barricades of paving stones and corrugated iron across roads to @entity95 to try to protect themselves against a potential police assault a woman shouts slogans during a rally in @entity110 yesterday : the protesters ' actions have brought gridlock to part of central @entity49 and it is unclear how long the authorities will tolerate their presence passion : another young woman shouts slogans			1
the square is lined by luxury hotels that should be doing a roaring trade as tourist season starts in one of the world 's most - visited cities per - capita income has tripled in nominal terms and business has boomed under his rule			2
but in recent years , critics say his style , always forceful and emotional , has become authoritarian			0
media have come under pressure , and the arrests of military and other figures over alleged coup plots as well as moves such as restrictions on alcohol sales have unsettled especially secular middle - class @entity9 who are sensitive to any encroachment of religion on their daily lives			1
the fierce crackdown , condemned by foreign powers , on what started as peaceful protests in @entity110 were the final straw , has caused simmering frustrations with @entity65 's leadership to boil over			0
' these protests are partly a result of his success in economic and social transformation			0
there 's a new generation who does n't want to be bullied by the prime minister and who is afraid their lifestyle is in danger , ' said @entity294 , a former @entity295 parliamentarian and @entity49 - based academic			1
very enterprising : a woman and her daughter sell @entity299 to protesters at @entity95 yesterday all you need is love : two protesters lie together on the grass of @entity110 , which the government wants to clear battleground : a protester climbs aboard a burned - out truck damaged in fierce fighting with police at @entity95 sources close to the @entity115 that mr @entity65 founded in 2001 , and which only a year later crushed traditional secular parties in elections , suggest a sense of siege within the leadership , with influential if disparate forces keen to remove @entity65			2
citing a party source , the @entity320 newspaper said an @entity115 executive meeting on saturday may discuss the possibility of calling early elections , although it could also change party rules to enable mr @entity65 to seek a fourth term as prime minister rather than running for the presidency			0
mr @entity65 has made clear he has no intention of stepping aside - pointing to the @entity115 's 50 percent of the vote in the last election - and he has no clear rivals inside the party or outside , with the opposition fragmented on the streets and in parliament .			2
