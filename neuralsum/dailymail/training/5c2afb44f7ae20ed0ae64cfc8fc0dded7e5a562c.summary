chancellor @entity0 was today forced to defend a @entity2 advert aimed at working class voters , claiming ' they ' enjoy bingo and cheap beer			1
@entity2 chairman @entity7 took to @entity8 last night to launch an advert devised by @entity10 to highlight @entity12 measures supposedly aimed at ‘ hardworking people ’			1
but it has been widely mocked online , and spawned spoof versions referring to whippets , clogs , eating swans , shooting poor people and suggesting the @entity20 think it is still 1961			1
’ mr @entity7 urged @entity2 supporters to ‘ spread the word ’			1
after waves of criticism and ridicule , a @entity2 source insisted : ' we stand by the advert			1
' but the @entity45 accused their coalition partners of being ' patronising ' , @entity30 said it was ‘ condescending ’ and the writers of political comedy @entity48 said they would have rejected it from a script for being ' too far - fetched '			2
in a round of media interviews this morning mr @entity0 was repeatedly asked to defend the advert , distracting from his key announcements on help for savers and pensioners			2
@entity2 chairman @entity7 , who tweeted the advert this afternoon after the @entity60 announcement in yesterday 's @entity61 took 1p off the price of a pint of beer and dramatically halved duty paid on bingo from 20 per cent to 10 per cent			1
both measures were seen as part of carefully crafted pitch to win over the skilled manual workers who backed @entity71 in their droves			0
but the row over the advert - in particular the use of the word ' they ' to refer to people who like beer and bingo - has overshadowed the message about help for bingo halls and pubs			1
' these are important @entity12 measures , they are not the only @entity12 measures , ' mr @entity0 told the @entity86			0
' this whole story ... was whipped up by a @entity30 that did n’t have anything else to say about the economy			0
' we are communicating what ’s in the @entity12			0
the more people hear about the @entity12 the more confident people can be that they are on the right track			2
' but his @entity45 deputy at the @entity97 , @entity95 , made clear his unease at the ad from his coalition partners			0
he it was ' rather patronising ' and ' demeans some quite sensible things ' in the @entity12			0
' there are good reasons to be supporting @entity106 , there are good reasons to be encouraging our pub sector to be stronger - that ’s the analysis behind those measures , ' he told @entity86 2 ’s @entity113 programme			2
' this language , well that ’s for @entity7 to justify			1
' @entity116 said @entity7 ’ tweet of a @entity2 poster was “ silly ” , but should not detract from a strong budget			1
deputy prime minister @entity116 said : ' i think the tweet was a bit silly , partly because actually the issues involved in this @entity12 were really quite serious , including , by the way , giving support to the bingo industry – an important industry – giving support to our pubs and so on			2
' speaking on his weekly radio phone - in on @entity132 , mr @entity116 added : ' there were just much bigger things at stake in the @entity12 as well , namely how are over 24million people going to benefit , which they will now do with an additional £ 100 tax cut			1
' the very important package we ’ve been working on for weeks to help savers ... because people who save , first , should be trusted more with how they manage their own money , their own savings ; but secondly , after years and years of low interest rates , we need to make sure as the recovery starts taking root that savers who have n’t really benefitted from that stand to do so from now on			2
' @entity151 , a senior aide to @entity30 leader @entity29 , described the advert as ‘ ill - conceived ’ and ‘ condescending ’			1
he said : ‘ of all the ill - conceived aspects of this @entity2 ad , it ’s the condescending use of the word “ they ” that grates the most			1
’ @entity158 , editor of the grassroots @entity45 website @entity160 , described the ad as an ‘ embarrassment ’ , and said it ‘ goes back to the 1950s ’			0
some @entity8 users suggested the advert must be a spoof			1
others said it reminded them of @entity171 ’s hit record ‘ @entity172 ’ which mocked the futile attempts of a rich student to understand the struggle faced by working class people			2
spoof versions of the advert were circulating on the internet within minutes of its release by mr @entity7			1
one said : ‘ cut the bingo tax and beer duty			1
that ’s what you wretched proles get up to , is n’t it ? ' so put on your clogs and grab your whippets and have at it ’			0
but some @entity20 were dismayed at the advert			2
one said : ‘ why are we talking about beer and bingo , not cuts in income tax ? we just look like we ’re talking down to people			1
’ @entity197 , a writer on political satire @entity48 , said the ad was beyond satire @entity45 treasury chief secretary @entity95 last night distanced himself from the @entity2 advert			2
he told the @entity86 ’s @entity113 programme : ‘ i thought it was a spoof at first			0
it may be our budget , but it ’s their words			0
’ @entity30 ’s shadow treasury chief secretary @entity208 described the advert as ‘ quite astonishing ’			0
‘ what better demonstration do you need that they are out of touch ? ’ the overwhelmingly negative reaction to the advert is a major embarrassment for mr @entity7 , a grammar school boy who prides himself on his understanding of ordinary voters			1
mr @entity7 has made it a major priority for the @entity20 to increase their effectiveness on social media , such as @entity8			1
he is now likely to face questions about who designed the advert and why he agreed to sign it off			0
it is also embarrassing for @entity231 , who is sensitive to charges that he is part of an out - of - touch metropolitan elite			0
a major poll conducted by former @entity2 treasurer lord @entity236 last month found that the most common description of the prime minister by voters was ‘ out of touch ’			0
mr @entity231 has also faced discomfort over his reliance on fellow @entity243 within his inner @entity245 secretary @entity244 sparked anger in @entity247 last week by describing the number of @entity243 at the heart of @entity250 as ‘ preposterous ’			0
in 2012 , @entity251 , then chief whip , was involved in a heated row with another police officer , @entity253 , after he was refused permission to cycle through the main gate of @entity257			0
mr @entity251 , accused of calling the officer a ‘ pleb ’ , was forced to resign his post after a month of intense media interest			0
two police officers were sacked over the so - called ‘ @entity263 ’			0
@entity264 , @entity265 , was jailed for a year at the @entity266 for misconduct in a public office .			0

party chairman @entity7 tweeted beer and bingo tax cuts advert
it said @entity60 cuts helped ' hardworking people ' do what ' they ' enjoy
@entity279 was immediately slammed as a ' pr disaster ' and ' ill - conceived '
some @entity8 users even suggested the post must be a hoax
