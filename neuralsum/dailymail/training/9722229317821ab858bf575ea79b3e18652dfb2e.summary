' i think my father could have had @entity18 as his running mate and it would n't have mattered in ' 07			1
i truly believe that , ' @entity1 now says of her dad 's failed bid for the presidency five and a half years ago @entity2 wrote in her 2010 book @entity27 that @entity4 added ' drama , stress , complications , panic and loads of uncertainty ' to her father 's presidential campaign ' and that after it was all said and done ' she wondered ' if it was @entity4 's fault ' that her dad , @entity39 senator @entity2 , lost the general election to now - president @entity41			1
in an interview about her book in august of 2010 , @entity2 argued that ' i do clearly state at the end that we did not lose because of her , and i 'm speaking out now because i do have conflicting feelings about her			0
' ' she brought so much momentum and enthusiasm to the campaign , ' @entity2 told @entity54 host @entity53			2
now , five and a half years later , @entity2 seems to have gained perspective on her dad 's failed bid for the presidency			0
not only does she now claim @entity4 is not at fault for her father 's defeat , she claims @entity4 was treated unfairly by the media			2
' i wish the media had been easier on her during that time , or at least more understanding , ' @entity2 told @entity8 in an interview that will air later tonight			1
@entity2 agreed with @entity8 that @entity4 did ' bring a lot on herself ' but said ' she was also not given a great hand and people really wanted to rip her apart			1

@entity3 presidential nominee @entity2 , center , waves to crowed during a rally with @entity3 vice presidential nominee @entity4 , right , his wife @entity80 , left , and daughter @entity1 , second left , in @entity83 , @entity84 on october 8 , 2008 @entity2 's distaste for @entity3 strategist @entity3 , on the other hand , still knows no bounds nor does her hatred for the @entity90			1
as the daughter of a presidential nominee , @entity2 had @entity90 protection for a few months in 2008			2
@entity2 said her time with the agents left a bad taste in her mouth , and she was n't surprised when they started getting into trouble with prostitutes			0
' i respect that they 're there to protect people , but i found them very cliquey and very gossipy and very voyeuristic			0
i did not like the secret service , ' she said			0
@entity2 's beef with @entity3 goes back more than a decade to the 2000 presidential election , during which her father was also a candidate			1
her family still believes @entity3 spread a rumor during that election that her adopted sister from @entity114 was an illegitimate child of her father			1
' i hate @entity3 and i think he still needs to apologize to my family , which he has not done , for the things that happened in 2000 , ' @entity2 told @entity8 , ' and i think there was an era where @entity3 was relevant and i do n’t know why people still give him attention			1
' she pointed to @entity123 2012 as evidence that people should stop taking the former @entity127 adviser seriously			0
on that day , @entity3 refused to believe that @entity3 presidential nominee @entity128 had lost the election , long after it had become clear that @entity41 had won			2

@entity1 , the daughter of @entity39 senator @entity2 , told @entity8 that @entity5 governor @entity4 is n't the reason her father lost the 2008 presidential election to @entity41
