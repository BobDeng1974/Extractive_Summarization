@entity0 is no stranger to touchline bust - ups			1
be it brow to brow , fist to fist or boot to bottle , the fiery @entity2 is n’t afraid to treat his technical zone as a boxing ring			0
his latest flashpoint came at @entity10 on sunday when he took on @entity11			0
here , @entity12 look back at five bouts involving the @entity15 boss … @entity0 ( left ) got into a touchline altercation with @entity11 on sunday @entity0 , 64 , pushed @entity11 in the chest with the @entity19 manager stumbling backwards wenger vs @entity11 , 2014 @entity22 ’s reckless lunge on @entity23 riled @entity0 and he made straight for @entity11			1
catching the @entity19 off guard , @entity0 planted his palms in @entity11 ’s chest , knocking him off balance			2
the @entity29 boss tried to retaliate but @entity0 ’s reach was too much and again the @entity15 chief landed a shove before the fourth official saved @entity11 further embarrassment			1
verdict : this was as good as a technical knockout for angry @entity0 who emerged as the clear victor … @entity0 squares up to @entity29 manager @entity11 on the touchline during sunday 's @entity41 match @entity0 and @entity11 had to be separated by fourth official @entity42 as their rivalry showed itself wenger vs @entity46 , 2011 the game was 11 minutes in to injury - time when @entity48 rescued a 1 - 1 draw for @entity50 from the penalty spot			1
@entity0 was n’t happy with the award of the spot - kick , nor the time added on , and approached @entity46			0
but the @entity55 was n’t in the mood to entertain @entity0 ’s moan , telling him to ‘ p * * * off ’ , which he duly did			0
verdict : @entity46 ’s sharp tongue gets him a tko over @entity0 , whose protest was a little lame			0
@entity46 ( left ) takes issue with @entity0 's complaints as @entity50 score a late equaliser in 2011 @entity0 managed to keep reasonably calm on this occasion , despite being told to p * * * off by @entity46 wenger vs plastic bottle , 2009 after celebrating @entity70 ’s goal at @entity71 - only to see it disallowed for a marginal offside - @entity0 took his frustration out on a plastic bottle , booting it in the air			1
the fourth official took exception to his thuggery and quickly informed referee @entity79 of his attack on the unsuspecting water bottle			0
@entity79 , equally enraged , sent @entity0 to the stands where he took his position on a platform behind the dugout , much to the amusement of @entity71 ’s supporters			2
verdict : knockout – the water bottle did not stand a chance … @entity0 is sent to the stands by the referee @entity79 during @entity71 's 2 - 1 against @entity15 in 2009 @entity0 lost his temper , kicking a bottle after a stoppage - time @entity70 goal was disallowed @entity0 eventually found a place to stand among @entity71 's gleeful fans before being told to move by @entity79 wenger vs @entity11 , 2007 for once , @entity0 played peacemaker when a mass brawl broke out during the 2007 @entity101 final			1
three players – @entity15 ’s @entity103 and @entity104 and @entity29 ’s @entity105 – were sent off , but @entity0 remained unflappable			2
he and @entity11 quickly entered the pitch as tempers – and fists – flared , but the @entity15 boss kept his own emotions in check and pulled his opposite number away from his own players			1
verdict : a rematch was needed to settle this score … @entity0 entered the field of play during the 2007 @entity101 final , but it was to act as peacemaker @entity11 and @entity0 argued as several players had to be pulled apart during the heated final wenger vs @entity123 , 2006 when @entity124 boss @entity123 celebrated @entity126 ’s late winner at @entity127 , @entity0 was n’t impressed			1
a @entity123 fist pump – in @entity0 ’s direction – was the source of his ire			2
@entity123 protested against @entity0 ’s displeasure but was met with a hefty shove			2
but the @entity2 was n’t finished there and , when he again went for his opposite number , the intervening fourth official felt @entity0 ’s wrath			0
@entity123 attempted to explain his actions but his adversary was n’t having any of it and refused to shake hands on full - time			0
@entity0 was subsequently fined by the @entity143 while @entity123 was cleared of all charges			0
verdict : @entity0 wins on points but pays the price for his brutality … @entity0 takes umbrage at the celebrations of @entity124 manager @entity123 in 2006 the @entity2 ( right ) refused to shake @entity123 's hand as the @entity151 were beaten 1 - 0 at @entity127 @entity126 had given @entity124 the lead before @entity123 celebrated the winning goal wenger vs @entity155 , 2006 @entity156 boss @entity155 instructed his players to carry on while two @entity15 men lay injured on the turf , and it resulted in a @entity162 goal			1
an irate @entity0 went brow to brow with the burly @entity163 before the fourth official stepped in			0
@entity0 ’s chest was puffed and his fists clenched , but this time he kept his hands down			0
verdict : @entity168 takes the contest on points … @entity0 and @entity156 manager @entity155 ( right ) are kept apart by fourth official @entity171 @entity155 makes a point to the @entity2 during @entity15 and @entity156 's 1 - 1 @entity41 draw in april , 2006			1
