by @entity1 reporter published : 19:57 est , 28 october 2012 updated : 02:45 est , 29 october 2012 you may have thought recruitment to @entity4 was wrapped in a veil of secrecy – involving mysterious brown envelopes or a tap on the shoulder			2
but the @entity4 has decided to take the more traditional approach of advertising in a national newspaper			2
the tongue - in - cheek advert , taken out in @entity14 , rubbishes the notion of @entity18 - style ‘ high - speed chases and shoot - outs ’ , instead saying the qualities looked for are ‘ far more ordinary ’			1
working for @entity4 is not all about @entity18 - style high speed chases or shoot outs according to a recruitment advert in the @entity14 it even suggests that while @entity4 does have an ‘ international focus ’ many of its jobs are based in @entity27 and ‘ fit well with family life ’			1
the advert also states that spies often need more ‘ subtle ’ qualities , such as ‘ the simple ability to get on with all sorts of people from all kinds of cultures ’			1
in a reference to @entity40 ’s novel @entity41 , the ad also pokes fun at the ‘ @entity44 image of the hyper - intelligent , slightly , dysfunctional oddball ’			1
dismissing the stereotype , the @entity46 says that ‘ in fact , you ’ll find that we value both emotional intelligence and academic achievement ’			0
in the full - page advertisement , , @entity4 also dismisses the ‘ white , male stereotype ’ , instead saying ‘ the truth is we do n’t care what sex you are or where you ’re from , as long as you ’re a @entity55 national ’			1
bosses also opened the job up to as many candidates as possible , saying that they ‘ do n’t care what you do now , only what you can do ’			0
@entity62 as @entity63 in the 2011 film @entity65 - the ad pokes fun at the @entity68 , @entity70 image of the hyper - intelligent , slightly , dysfunctional oddball ' but while the campaign is one of @entity4 ’s most open recruitment drives , it still emphasises the need for secrecy , telling possible candidates that they can not discuss their application with anybody			1
a spokesman for the @entity81 said that the campaign is ‘ designed to attract people from a wide variety of backgrounds who have the skills we are looking for , but for various reasons may not have considered a career in @entity4 ’			0
the spokesman added : ‘ it is crucial that we continue to protect @entity55 interests both at home and abroad , so we need to ensure that we have the right skills and capability to do that			0
‘ as people move on from the service , it is important that we continue to ensure talented people consider the service as a career			0
’ earlier this month , @entity104 , the @entity55 ’s internal security agency , announced that it was seeking to hire as many as 100 recruits as young as 18 to ‘ take a degree in spying ’ instead of going to university			2
@entity104 bosses also sought to expel the ‘ myth ’ that a career in the intelligence services is ‘ the preserve of privately educated men ’			0
the @entity81 said it wanted to harness the talents of the ‘ @entity116 generation ’ who have grown up with social networking sites , global internet connections and interactive gaming .			0
