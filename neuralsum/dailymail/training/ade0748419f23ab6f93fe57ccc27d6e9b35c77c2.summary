with the stricken victim safely plucked from a 30ft roof after a two - hour operation , firefighters may have insisted it was a successful operation			1
but taxpayers were left questioning the wisdom of a £ 1,000 mission to rescue a seagull with a fire engine and aerial ladder platform – especially as the bird had to be put down almost straight away			1
the gull was spotted on sunday morning by a family on the roof of their three - storey home in @entity17 , @entity18			1
they could see it was injured but could not reach it , so called the @entity22			1
scene : two fire crews were dispatched to the house in @entity17 , @entity18 , on sunday to rescue the trapped seagull emergency : the stricken victim safely plucked from the 30ft roof after a two - hour operation ( file picture ) they in turn called the fire brigade , which sent a fire engine , but the crew was unable to reach the gull so a second team was called in with the high - rise equipment from @entity41 , nine miles away			1
hoisting the longer ladder then proved tricky because of electrical wires around the house			1
neighbour @entity53 , 36 , said : ‘ there was such a commotion , we thought someone had fallen from a window or had an accident			0
i could n’t believe it when my son came back and said it was a bird			2
’ the gull was handed to the @entity22 but had to be put to sleep because it was suffering from leg injuries and suspected botulism			1
a spokesman for the charity said : ‘ while this has a sad ending , we would like to thank the fire and rescue service for their assistance			2
it is a great training aid for the service and their help meant the @entity22 was able to quickly and painlessly help a suffering animal			1
’ but @entity76 ’ @entity75 director @entity74 said : ‘ nobody wants to see animals suffer , but incidents like these raise serious concerns about whether this is the best way for the fire brigade to use its time			0
it does seem like a rather excessive response			0
’ on a local newspaper website , one user wrote : ‘ what a waste of money			0
it ’s just an airborne rat			0
what was needed was somebody with an air rifle			0
’ when the first fire crew could n't reach the bird , firefighters from @entity41 fire station , above , were called on a recent @entity100 request sent to 56 fire services showed they had rescued 17,000 animals in the three years to 2011 at a cost of £ 3.5million			1
that included 2,090 birds , among them 1,244 seagulls , 159 pigeons , 57 swans and 12 parrots			0
they have also been called out to rescue dolphins , bats , iguanas , a chameleon – and even a snail that was crawling up an elderly woman ’s wall			0
in 2012 , 25 firemen were sent to rescue a seagull from a 3ft - deep pond in @entity122 – but then refused to wade in because of health and safety regulations			2
the @entity22 spokesman added : ‘ like any member of the public , the @entity22 can request the help of the @entity129 , but it is entirely up to them what level of response they can provide			2
’ last night a @entity136 spokesman said : ‘ the main reason we carry out animal rescues is that if we do n’t do it there is a strong possibility that members of the public will attempt a rescue , putting themselves at risk without our skills and experience			0
’ he added : ‘ we used available resources , with equipment and crews at three nearby stations ready to cover any other incidents , and if human life were at risk we would have redirected those involved in the rescue at once			0
’ the spokesman confirmed that one fire engine attended , plus an aerial ladder platform which was on site for less than an hour .			2

@entity162 had become trapped on roof of three - storey house in @entity165 , @entity18
