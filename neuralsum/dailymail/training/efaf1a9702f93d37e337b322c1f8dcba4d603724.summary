@entity1 's players looked in good spirits after a successful @entity4 period , as they trained ahead of the third of their festive fixtures hoping to pick up another three points			0
@entity8 and @entity9 appeared to be having a great time , with the @entity12 star in particular unable to suppress his laughter throughout wednesday 's training session			0
defender @entity15 , who returned from injury for the 2 - 1 win over @entity18 on sunday , was also in a good mood , showing off for the cameras as @entity1 prepared for a trip to @entity22			1
@entity9 ( right ) and @entity8 laugh together in training as @entity1 prepared for their third game in seven days the @entity12 forward and the @entity27 midfielder , @entity1 's best two players of late , share a hug during training on wednesday morning @entity32 defender @entity15 , who looks set to start consecutive games after overcoming an injury , smiles for the camera @entity15 was wrapped up warm in a hat and a snood during the warm - up as @entity1 prepared for a trip to @entity22 on @entity40 the @entity41 go into the game off the back of consecutive wins which have lifted them to fifth in the table , level on points with thursday 's opponents , and a win could take them as high as third if @entity51 lose at @entity52			1
but @entity1 may have to play the game without a recognised striker , with @entity55 serving the second game of his three - match suspension and @entity58 doubtful and due to be assessed before the game			1
however , elsewhere @entity61 's injury problems are beginning to ease , with @entity62 and @entity63 fit again , while @entity15 could be set for a second consecutive start after a stop - start first half of the season			2
@entity9 , who has scored 15 goals for @entity1 since joining , celebrates scoring in training while @entity8 ca n't believe what he 's seeing the @entity12 forward , who scored with a header against @entity72 on @entity73 , shows off his ability in the air per @entity76 brings the ball down under the watchful eye of his centre back partner @entity15 during wednesday 's training session @entity62 could feature against @entity22 having been on the bench following his recovery from a groin problem , and while midfielder @entity84 is not match fit as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury , @entity83 playmaker @entity63 should return having been rested			2
' @entity84 is not available yet , there is no setback , but it is a bit slower than i expected it to be , ' said @entity61 on tuesday			0
' because he had a setback last year , we have to be very cautious with his thigh - he was out for three months , so we have to be a bit more cautious than we would like to be			0
' @entity95 chases the ball as @entity62 and @entity63 exchange passes on a cold morning at @entity98 @entity1 go into thursday 's game knowing that a win will take them above @entity22 , and could even see them move as high as third @entity61 could be without a recognised striker for the vital fixture , with @entity55 suspended and @entity58 a doubt @entity61 accepts it is a difficult balance to keep all of his players fresh over the hectic @entity4 schedule and also not lose the dynamic of the team			1
' rotation is a sensitive subject because you can destabilise your team with too much rotation , so you have to find the right numbers of rotating the team , ' said @entity61			0
' overall , you want to keep the balance of your team and as well refresh sometimes in the positions where players are a bit tired			0
' @entity63 , who scored against @entity72 before being rested for the game at @entity121 , could be recalled for the trip to @entity123 's former @entity22 trio @entity125 ( right ) , @entity62 and @entity124 ( left ) take time out to pose for a picture @entity9 points to young striker @entity127 , who could be drafted in to play against @entity22 if @entity58 fails a fitness test			1
