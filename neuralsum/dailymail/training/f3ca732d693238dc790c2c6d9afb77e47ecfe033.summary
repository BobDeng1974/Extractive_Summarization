it 's long been thought our moon formed after @entity3 was hit by a planet the size of @entity6 billions of years ago - but the time of formation has been fiercely debated			1
some scientists believe it occurred approximately 30 million years after the formation of the solar system , while others claim it happened up to 100 million years later			1
using measurements from the interior of @entity3 coupled with computer simulations , an international team of planetary scientists claim it was the latter - and have discovered what it is calling a ‘ geological clock			2
’ using measurements from the interior of @entity3 , coupled with computer simulations , an international team of planetary scientists earlier this year claimed the moon , pictured , formed 95 million years after the formation of the solar system , 4.6 billion years ago - plus or minus 32 to 39 million years many researchers believe the moon formed after @entity3 was hit by a planet the size of @entity6 billions of years ago			1
this is called the giant impact hypothesis			0
the hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 @entity41			0
the colliding body is sometimes called @entity43 , after the mythical @entity44 who was the mother of @entity46 , the goddess of the @entity47			0
the researchers from @entity49 , @entity50 and the @entity51 carried out 259 computer simulations of the growth of @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity3 and @entity6			1
during this analysis , the scientists discovered a link between when the @entity3 was hit , and the amount of material added to @entity3 after the impact			1
this relationship works much like a clock to date the moon - forming event and is said to be the first ‘ geologic clock ’ in early solar system history that does not rely on measurements and interpretations of the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei to determine age			2
‘ we were excited to find a ' clock ' for the formation time of the moon that did n't rely on radiometric dating methods , ’ said lead author @entity73 of the @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity49			0
‘ this correlation just jumped out of the simulations and held in each set of old simulations we looked at			0
’ the amount of mass that was released by @entity3 after the moon was formed was taken from previous studies			2
the solar system is thought to have formed 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of part of a molecular cloud			1
the majority of the collapsing mass formed in in the centre , which became the @entity100 , while the rest flattened into a disk , artist 's impression pictured , out of which the planets and moons formed the researchers from @entity49 , @entity50 and the @entity51 carried out 259 computer simulations of the growth of @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity3 and @entity6			1

it dates the moon - forming event and is said to be the first ‘ geologic clock ’ in early solar system history that does not rely on measurements and interpretations of the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei to determine age			2
these reports previously demonstrated that the abundance in the @entity3 's mantle of highly siderophile elements - atomic elements that are chemically associated with iron - is directly proportional to the mass released after @entity3 ’s impact			0
from these geochemical measurements , the newly established clock dates the moon to approximately 95 million years after the beginning of the solar system - with an uncertainty of between 32 and 39 million years			1
the solar system is believed to have formed around 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of part of a molecular cloud			1
the majority of the collapsing mass formed in the centre , which became the @entity100 , while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk , out of which the planets and moons formed			0
‘ this result is exciting because in the same simulations that can successfully form @entity6 in only 2 to 5 million years , we can also form the moon at 100 million years , ’ added author dr. @entity152 from the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) @entity155 and @entity154			1
‘ these vastly different timescales have been very hard to capture in simulations			0
’ the findings are reported in the journal @entity163 .			0

after the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago , @entity3 was said to have been hit by a @entity6 - sized planet
impact led to the *creation* of the moon and material being added to @entity3
study used simulations to see how @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity3 developed
it found a relationship between the impact and the addition of material
they concluded the moon formed 95 million years after the solar system
