not only does billionaire @entity0 not ' regret ' questioning president @entity2 's birth place , @entity0 now says there 's ' a very good chance ' president @entity2 pretended to be @entity6 in order to attract financial aid money in college			1
' because if you say you were born in @entity6 , you got aid , and you got into colleges , ' @entity0 said , ' people were doing that			1
' @entity15 star told @entity17 - based reporters on tuesday that he still does n't understand why president @entity2 would turn down a $ 50 million gift to charity if he 's telling the truth about his past			1
@entity0 , chairman and president of the @entity24 , said today it 's possible that president @entity2 was born in the @entity26 but lied on college applications and said he was from @entity6			1
' because if you say you were born in @entity6 , you got aid , and you got into colleges , ' @entity0 said @entity0 's disbelief that @entity2 is indeed an @entity26 citizen , as required by law to hold the presidency , stems from a typo in a book agency 's 1991 biography of @entity2 , in which @entity2 was listed as being from @entity6			1
after the bio surfaced in 2012 a former editor at the book company said it was ' a fact checking error			0
' @entity0 is n't as sure the line itself was a mistake as he is that then - @entity44 state senator @entity2 made a mistake in having it put in his promotional materials			1
even after @entity2 released documentation of his birth , @entity0 said he remained unconvinced			2
several days before the 2012 presidential election , @entity0 announced that he was offering president @entity2 $ 5 million to put toward a charity in his home town , @entity53 , @entity44 , if he turned over his birth certificate , passport and college records			1
@entity0 says he later increased that amount to $ 50 million , a number that was not reported in the media at the time , but @entity2 still would n't play ball			1
' i never heard from him , ' @entity0 said on tuesday , adding that he would take the money if it were the other way around			0
' @entity0 ' got on the subject of @entity2 's background today after he was asked during the q and a portion of a @entity69 luncheon if he regretted his past statements about the president 's birthplace			1
' not even a little bit , ' @entity0 said			0
' i do n't regret it			0
' ' why would i regret it ? ' he asked amid applause from the audience			0
@entity0 said there were three scenarios to explain @entity2 's past : ' either it 's fine , or he was born in @entity6 , or in my opinion there 's a very good chance he was born here , and said he was born in @entity6			1
because if you were born in @entity6 , you got into colleges , and you got aid , ' @entity0 said			1
' though many @entity26 have tired of @entity0 's quest to see @entity2 's personal records , @entity0 claims people on the street are still asking him to pursue the issue			1
' now i hope that it 's 100 percent fine , ' @entity0 said , but later mentioned ' i 'd love to see what 's put down			2
' believe it or not , @entity0 's hair is real ' they attack my hair			2
it 's mine , ' @entity0 said during his speech while yanking on his head			2
' would anybody like to inspect ? ' unlike @entity2 , @entity0 says he 's all facts and no fiction			2
his hair ? totally real , @entity0 said on tuesday			2
' they attack my hair			0
it 's mine , ' @entity0 said during his speech while yanking on his head			0
' would anybody like to inspect ? ' ' they say you wear the worst hairpiece i 've ever seen , what a horrible wig , ' he continued , explaining that he 's made it clear on @entity116 that his hair is real , yet people keep claiming it 's fake for some reason he said			0
' you know it 's funny , but when people wan na keep going , they keep going , ' @entity0 noted			0
the billionaire was less forthcoming about whether or not he has any big political plans for 2016			0
' we ’re going to see what happens in ‘ 16 , ' he said			0
' if i do n’t see the right person , i will do something in ’ 16			0
i will do it sure as you ’re sitting here			0

@entity0 still does n't understand why president @entity2 would n't accept his offer to put $ 50 million toward a charity of the president 's *choice* if he 's telling the truth about his background
@entity0 said he thinks its likely that @entity2 was born in the @entity26 after all and instead lied on college applications about being born in @entity6
' because if you say you were born in @entity6 , you got aid , and you got into colleges , ' @entity0 said during a speech on tuesday . ' people were doing that . '
the @entity0 also said he does n't understand why people do n't believe his hair is real and that he 's still *deciding* whether to run for president in 2016
