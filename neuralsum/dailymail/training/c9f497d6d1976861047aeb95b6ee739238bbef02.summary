shocking : retired teacher @entity0 , 82 , was found by her daughter in hospital covered in food a retired teacher was found dehydrated and groping for food in hospital because nurses failed to realise she was virtually blind , her horrified daughter has said			1
@entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , has apologised for ' fundamental failings ' in its care of 82 - year - old @entity0 after she was admitted following a fall in june			1
staff were told the pensioner 's eyes could only pick out light and dark after suffering almost total blindness triggered by arteriosclerosis , a hardening of the arteries which restricts blood flow			1
but when her daughter @entity24 re-visited her on june 27 - just ten days after she was admitted - she discovered her mother dishevelled , dehydrated and covered in food			1
it was the result of mrs @entity0 desperately groping for items she could not see			1
' they have a red tray policy , ' said mrs @entity31 , 46			0
' a red tray for those visually impaired			0
' we were horrified to see food and pots of medication left out of mum 's reach			1
' how medical professionals can fail to realise someone is virtually sightless simply beggars belief			0
' on the same visit , said mrs @entity31 , the whiteboard behind her mother 's bed which should have shown details of her nurse was blank			0
she has now raised the case with @entity10 mp @entity53 , who has also received a letter directly from the pensioners ' nine - year - old granddaughter @entity57			1
' @entity58 will never be the same and she used to do lovely things , like make jelly with us , ' @entity57 told the mp			0
' some of the nurses have been very good but some of them were not			0
' they forgot my grandma was blind , which was n't very good , and made me and my sister hope not very happy at all			0
desperation : the pensioner , who can only see shades of light and dark , with her head in her hands ' worst of all , @entity74 and i have n't seen our grandma since july and that was just through a hospital window			1
' mr @entity53 has now pledged to investigate the case			0
despite the horror discovery just ten days into her stay on the orthopaedic @entity82 14 , widow mrs @entity0 spent another 62 days in hospital because she suffered an infection - which her daughter believes was septic shock			1
she survived the life - threatening infection but it had a permanent effect on her brain function , and she can no longer recognise her family			2
the 82 - year - old entered the hospital ' coherent and alert ' but is now confined to a nursing home for life			1
previously she had lived independently in an adapted home with talking clocks , coloured hobs and visits from helpers three times a day			1
mrs @entity31 , who regularly makes the 350 - mile round trip to see her mother from her home in @entity107 , @entity108 , said : ' her cognition has gone and that is the most distressing thing			2
complaint : the hospital in @entity10 , @entity11 , made a full apology after the family 's complaint ' she does n't recognise me now			1
@entity117 taught for a time in @entity118 and spends a lot of time believing she is still there			0
' this is a woman who went on holiday with us in may			0
yes , she was reliant on a @entity127 frame , but she had all her faculties			0
' i firmly believe my mother is alive not because of the efforts of @entity82 , but because of family and friends who gave her food and fluids			2
holiday : @entity0 with her daughter @entity24 and granddaughters @entity57 and @entity138 ' she pulled through despite the care of @entity140			1
' the pensioner 's daughter has a string of other complaints against the hospital , including that over-stretched staff described a shift as ' bonkers , manic and very stressful ' on @entity149			1
she was also initially told her mother 's infection was a sickness and diarrhoea bug , she added			2
within days , mrs @entity0 had deteriorated to the extent where she was classified as ' critically ill '			1
discharge papers wrongly referred to the pensioner as a stroke victim , and another letter received during the complaints process even described her as dead			2
all this was despite mrs @entity0 , who taught in schools in the @entity163 area for 40 years , having a good experience during a previous stay			2
' it has been a farce , an absolute farce , ' said her daughter			2
' @entity167 famously said " the very first requirement in a hospital is that it should do the sick no harm "			2
my mother is in a far , far worse state than when she went into @entity140			0
' hospital staff have apologised for the care they gave to mrs @entity0			1
@entity177 general manager @entity138 told her family in a letter : ' i would absolutely concur all the concerns you have raised are absolutely valid and the response you received initially was not acceptable in terms of actions and accountability			0
' there are fundamental failings that , as a @entity188 , are being addressed and are ongoing			0
' as a result of the case @entity140 will introduce a ' visually impaired ' policy , the letter pledged			0
@entity193 , the hospital 's managing director , added : ' we are very sorry to learn of the concerns raised by mrs @entity0 ' family			1
' we have offered a full apology because this is not the standard of care we expect for our patients			0
holiday : mrs @entity0 with her granddaughters			2
her last holiday was just a month before she was admitted ' we are sorry that mrs @entity0 did not receive the highest standards of care in june when she was treated at @entity9			1
' we are keen to meet with family members to ensure that all of their issues are addressed and that we personally apologise for the poor care that mrs @entity0 received			2
' we have also taken steps to address the points raised so that we can improve the standards of care for all our patients			0
' it comes less than a month after @entity218 , which runs the hospital , was named as one of the worst in the country for patient complaints			0
latest figures show that 5,518 patients waited more than the four - hour target at @entity226 , @entity140 and @entity228 hospitals , which are all run by the @entity188 , compared to 1,619 in 2009 - 10 â€“ an increase of 240 per cent .			0
