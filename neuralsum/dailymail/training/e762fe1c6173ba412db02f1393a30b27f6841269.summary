since the success of these establishments , bunny cafés have followed			1
and the trend for coffee shops which double up as petting zoos shows no signs of slowing			2
now , the first ever owl café has opened in the @entity15 of the @entity17 capital			1
animal cafés are so successful in the @entity20 country because pets are often forbidden in apartments			1
animal cafés are so popular in the @entity20 country because pets are often forbidden in apartments in @entity17 dubbed the @entity27 no @entity28 , or the @entity29 , the establishment opened recently in @entity15 , @entity1			1
the coffee shop 's birds are tethered to plastic and wire trays and can be petted and held by customers			2
it has attracted much local media attention , and popular website @entity38 paid them a visit and reported back on what they found			2
reporters said the shopfront windows had their curtains closed , so no outside light can filter in - and no pedestrians can stop to look either			0
owl enthusiasts queued outside to wait for a time slot to pet the birds and drink coffee			0
the café does n’t have a booking system so customers must come on the day hope there will be an opening			1
the birds are tethered to plastic trays to be seen , petted , and held ' once you ’re let inside the cafe , the first thing they have you do is settle into a seat and choose a drink , ' writes @entity65			0
' the menu is pretty simple : you can choose from iced , hot , or alcoholic drinks like coffee , tea , and beer			0
' since there ’s no cover charge , you have to buy at least one drink – which will cost you 1,000 yen [ £ 6.30 ] for non-alcoholic drinks or 1,200 [ £ 7.50 ] yen for alcoholic drinks			0
while this might seem expensive , it also gets you one hour with the owls			1
' @entity65 explains that the café has strict rules governing contact with the birds			1
' it ’s nothing too extreme , but some of the owls ca n’t be held and others can not be touched at all			1
' also , while photos are completely fine , you ’re not allow to use your flash or take videos			0
' finally , when holding an owl , or , rather , when an owl is perched on you , you have to hold the tether tightly			0
' the shopfront windows were covered with curtains , so no outside light can get in the café has strict rules customers must read before they are allowed near the owls he goes on to say that though the birds are quite mellow , if they get spooked or irritated , they ’ll try to fly away			1
so by hanging onto the tether , you can prevent them from smacking into a wall or getting attacked by another owl			0
furthermore , customers are warned that there might be issues with owl droppings			0
with the introduction finished , writers were allowed to handle the owls			1
' when petting the owls , there are two things you have to careful of			2
the first is to pet softly , from front to back			0
you need to go with the feathers ; going against the feathers can hurt the birds , ' writes @entity65			0
' the other thing is just being aware that they might try to nibble your hand			0
this is how they communicate , so unless it really hurts , just continue petting			0
if you start and stop too much , it will annoy the owls			2
the @entity17 capital of @entity1 has opened its first ever owl cafe in the @entity15 region @entity134 warns wild animals and have specialist needs which are hard to cater for in a captive environment customers can take photos , but they 're not allow to use flash or take videos some of the owls were off - limits to customers for various reasons			1
one was born blind , so could n’t be petted for fear of surprising him , and there were two owls that were just too tired			2
@entity151 contacted the @entity134 for their opinion on the owls ' welfare			1
they responded with the following comment			0
' we would have serious concerns for the welfare of wild animals kept in captivity in this way in the @entity162 , ' said senior @entity134 wildlife scientist dr @entity163			1
' @entity164 are beautiful animals which appeal to many people but they do not make good pets and are not suitable to be used in this way			0
they are wild animals and have specialist needs which are hard to cater for in a captive environment			0
' @entity164 are by nature generally shy and reclusive birds , preferring to spend most of their time roosting in a secluded place , and most species are nocturnal			2
they also have sharp talons and strong feet that can inflict deep puncture wounds and scratches			0
