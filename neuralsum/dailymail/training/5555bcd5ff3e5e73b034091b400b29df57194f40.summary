@entity0 is being offered the chance by @entity3 club @entity2 to end his @entity5 nightmare			1
@entity6 reported last month that @entity0 is not wanted by new @entity5 manager @entity7			1
now it is understood that @entity5 and @entity2 have begin tentative negotiations over the transfer of a player who never settled to life under @entity13 at @entity14 last season			1
however @entity0 is aware of @entity2 's interest and that the club 's manager @entity34 believes he can turn him back in to the buccaneering forward player he was when he was at @entity37 and wants to utilise his physical presence			1
@entity0 , for his part , has accepted that @entity40 does n't want him and is open to the move			2
however , @entity5 want a cash sale for a player who cost £ 27.5m while @entity2 wish to explore the possibility of a loan			0
that would probably only be acceptable to @entity5 if @entity2 could fund all of @entity0 's £ 100,000 - a - week wage packet			1
on monday , the player was back in @entity49 after his efforts with @entity51 in the @entity52			0
because his country reached the last eight of the tournament , he was not required to join @entity5 's tour of @entity57 and was back at @entity58 with compatriot @entity59 for physical testing on monday			2
off the pace : @entity0 struggled badly throughout his debut season at @entity14 unwanted : @entity7 is hoping to offload @entity0 before the start of the new campaign @entity40 - whose team face @entity66 in @entity67 on tuesday night - told @entity5 chief executive @entity68 early in the summer that he did n't see @entity0 as a @entity5 player and wanted him to sell him			1
it is understood that the future looks similarly bleak for @entity73 midfielder @entity72 and other bit - part players @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			0
meanwhile , @entity40 goes into the game at @entity67 's @entity79 knowing that victory over the @entity3 side would leave @entity5 on the verge of a place in next week 's @entity84 in @entity85			2
this would mean extending a two - and - half week tour by an extra three days , something that @entity40 will have mixed views about			0
with @entity5 already in talks with promoters about an offer to return to the @entity57 next summer to play games in @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , @entity40 has told the club he wishes things to be done differently			0
on tour : @entity5 are currently away in the @entity57 on a pre-season schedule captain for the day : midfielder @entity102 , derided by some @entity5 fans , skippered the side against @entity104 the @entity106 veteran wants the tour to be a maximum of two weeks long and wants a central @entity57 training base that @entity5 can travel to and from to play game elsewhere			0
it has been the distance between hotels , training grounds and stadia that have infuriated @entity40 on this tour and he wants assurances it wo n't happen again			0
@entity79 , for example , is 90 minutes away from @entity5 's central @entity118 here while saturday 's game against @entity121 will be played in @entity122 , 50 miles away from @entity5 's base in @entity124 .			2

@entity0 has met with representatives from @entity2 over potential move
new boss @entity7 does not want the midfielder at @entity14
@entity2 coach @entity34 believes the @entity51 could be an asset
@entity40 *unhappy* with aspects of @entity5 's *lengthy* @entity134
