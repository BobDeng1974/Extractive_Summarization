dr @entity48 , director of the @entity49 described the find as ‘ of national importance and one of the finest ever uncovered in @entity1			1
’ ‘ we had almost finished our six - month study of the site when we came upon a small tangled ball of metal that turned out to be jewellery that had lain there undisturbed since @entity60 , ’ he said			2
archeologists think that the jewellery was buried by a terrified @entity1 woman as warrior queen @entity2 ( pictured as a statue ) and her army advanced on the town of @entity5 , almost 2,000 years ago the impressive collection of jewellery was discovered by the @entity70 department store on the @entity15 in @entity5 ( marked ) and it 's hoped more treasure could be found nearby the @entity1 owner of the jewellery ( pictured left and right ) is unknown , but she may have been killed in a ‘ sacred grove ’ – a fate which befell @entity1 wealthy women captured by the army the @entity79 raged from 60 - 61ad and saw @entity81 tribes , under @entity2 of the @entity47 , unsuccessfully try to defeat the @entity1 army			1
@entity2 was queen of the @entity47 people , a @entity81 tribe who lived in what is today @entity87 and parts of @entity89 and @entity90			1
her name is an early for of the more commonly known name ' @entity93 '			0

but , when @entity94 died , the @entity95 decided to rule the @entity47 directly and they confiscated the property of the leading @entity47 families			0

dr @entity48 said : ‘ it is a particularly poignant find because of its historical context - @entity2 and her army destroyed @entity103 and @entity105 but many of the inhabitants had time to escape however the people of @entity5 were not so fortunate			1
‘ they knew a large @entity1 army was coming to their aid but they were practically defenceless , with only a small force of soldiers and no town defences			1
‘ imagine their panic and desperation when they learnt of the massacre of a large part of the @entity149 on its way to relieve them and after a two - day siege they were over-run			0
’ he explained that they would have tried desperately to bury and hide valuables like jewellery for safe - keeping			2
‘ we know that the “ noblest ” of @entity5 ’s @entity1 women were taken to sacred groves , where they were killed in a horrific way and the quality of the jewellery we have found suggests that the owner would have been in this category but there is no direct evidence to indicate she ended up in a sacred grove			1

the @entity172 sacking and burning of @entity5 left in its wake a distinctive red and black layer of debris up to half a metre thick across the centre of much of modern - day @entity5 ( pictured left )			0
this layer is still being examined by archaeologists on the site , which is part of the @entity70 department store ( right ) a bone belonging of a @entity1 victim of the @entity47 rebels , was found during redevelopment of a department store in @entity5 in july			1
the jawbone dates back to around 60ad , and was unearthed among burnt building debris under the town ’s @entity15			0
it is only the second time remains of this kind have been found in the region			2
an archaeologist said that the bones must be the remains of people who died in buildings set on fire by the @entity81 as they quickly overran the town			0
this layer – made up for burned clay walls - is still being examined by archaeologists on the site , which is part of the @entity70 department store			2
they explained that human remains are rarely found among such debris , but the latest excavation has already yielded part of a jaw and shin bone , which appear to have been cut by a heavy , sharp implement such as a sword			0
experts think that there could have been resistance from the beleaguered garrison at the site			0
dr @entity48 said : ‘ we also discovered food on the floor of the room in which the jewellery was found , including dates , figs , wheat , peas and grain			2
’ he thinks it may have been stored on a wooden shelf , which had collapsed on to the floor			0

@entity252 included gold armlets , earrings , rings , chains and coins
it was found buried *beneath* @entity32 in @entity17
archaeologists think the jewellery was stashed by a terrified @entity1 woman when she heard @entity2 and her army were advancing
there is a chance that the owner of the hoard was sacrificed if caught
@entity252 is being cleaned and could be *declared* ' treasure '
