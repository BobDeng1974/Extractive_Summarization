by @entity1 reporter published : 05:49 est , 5 february 2014 @entity3 : 07:10 est , 5 february 2014 @entity6 military advice was given to the @entity8 authorities ahead of the 1984 massacre at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity4 admitted yesterday			1
a @entity13 ( @entity13 ) officer flew to the country and advised @entity8 's military leaders ahead of the assault in @entity11			1
but a @entity18 investigation into @entity6 involvement in the incident concluded the advice had a ' limited impact ' on the operation			1
it found the officer 's advice was largely ignored and @entity28 ’s government instead launched a frontal assault – codenamed @entity30 - which killed 575 and resulted in up to 3,000 deaths from subsequent riots			1
@entity6 involvement : an @entity13 officer did visit the @entity10 and advise @entity8 military leaders ahead of the 1984 attack in @entity11 which resulted in 3,000 deaths , a government investigation has found prime minister @entity39 ( left ) has asked for @entity40 to forgive the @entity41 after it emerged @entity42 ( right ) approved the @entity13 officer 's visit and advise to the @entity8 government ahead of the massacre the investigation was ordered by cabinet secretary sir @entity48 after documents released under the 30 - year rule suggested that an @entity13 officer advised the @entity8 about how to deal with the @entity40 dissidents occupying the site			1
foreign secretary @entity4 told the @entity54 that a @entity6 adviser travelled to @entity8 in february 1984 , but his recommendation for a surprise assault using helicopters was not reflected in the raid which took place in june that year and resulted in extensive bloodshed			2
mr @entity4 said : ' the cabinet secretary 's report finds that the nature of the @entity6 's assistance was purely advisory , limited and and provided to the @entity8 government at an early stage ; that it had limited impact on the tragic events that unfolded at the temple three months later ; that there was no link between the provision of this advice and defence sales and there is no record of the ( @entity6 ) government receiving advance notice of the operation			2
' alliance : @entity39 visited the temple last year , and @entity40 in @entity6 form a key bloc vote for the @entity41 he told @entity82 the @entity13 assessment ‘ made clear that a military operation should only be put into effect as a last resort ’ and recommended that any military operation use ‘ an element of surprise and the use of helicopter - borne forces in the interest of reducing casualties and bringing about a swift resolution ’			1
@entity39 last night pleaded with the @entity40 community to forgive the @entity41 as it emerged @entity42 had agreed to send the special forces officer to help the @entity8			1
her principal private secretary at the time , lord @entity98 , said it was clear the then - prime minister had considered sending the @entity13 officer ' very carefully ' before agreeing to it			1
anger : lord @entity103 said mr @entity4 's statement was ' smug and condescending ' mr @entity39 yesterday said he wanted the dialogue between the government and the @entity40 community over the issue to continue , adding : ‘ @entity6 @entity40 have made – and continue to make – a vital contribution to our national life			2
' thirty years ago , a great tragedy unfolded ... in @entity11			0
many lives were lost and the scars in the @entity40 community still run deep			0
‘ i tasked the cabinet secretary with getting to the truth			0
he did so , and there are two main findings			0
‘ one : around four months before the events , at the request of the @entity18 , a single @entity6 military officer provided some advice			2
but critically , this advice was not followed , and it was a one - off			0
‘ two : there is absolutely no evidence of @entity127 involvement in the operation itself			0
’ the prime minister travelled to @entity11 last year to visit the temple - a trip that appeared to have led to a rise in @entity134 support among @entity6 sikhs , who are a key voting bloc in marginal constituencies in @entity138 and the @entity139			1
his efforts are seen by many to have been dashed by the new revelations			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity143 said ' serious questions ' remained , adding : ‘ the pain and suffering still felt by many about the tragic events of 1984 places a particular duty on the government to provide what answers it can to address very genuine concerns			0
’ @entity153 , of the @entity154 @entity6 , said @entity6 ’s involvement was clear , adding : ‘ we are actually very disappointed with the announcement			0
’ the assault triggered the assassination of @entity8 prime minister @entity28 ( pictured right with @entity42 on a visit to @entity8 ) , who ordered the attack , when two @entity40 bodyguards killed her in revenge several months later lord @entity103 , director of the @entity166 , called mr @entity4 ’s statement ‘ smug and condescending ’ and said the language in the documents was ‘ insulting ’ to @entity40 since it suggested they were all extremists			1
on the claim that @entity6 advice had a ‘ limited impact ’ of the @entity10 attack , lord @entity103 said : ‘ it is like saying that i had only a minimal involvement in a massacre or a holocaust			2
’ @entity179 , director of the @entity180 , which represents @entity40 professionals in the @entity6 , said the information disclosed in the review ‘ harks back to colonial times ’			0
he added : ‘ i think there are lots of people in the @entity40 community who are upset that the @entity6 could be involved in this , even to a limited extent			0
