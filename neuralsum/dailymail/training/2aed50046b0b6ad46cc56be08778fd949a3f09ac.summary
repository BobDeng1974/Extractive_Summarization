hundreds of thousands of silverside fish move as one to form one gigantic swirl surrounding a group of divers in the @entity5			1
the shoal creates waves of silver light , swimming inside underwater caves in the @entity11 ’s @entity10 off the @entity12			1
the small fish believes in strength in numbers , confusing predators as they swim as one big shift			1
‘ every year predators and divers await the arrival of the silversides , ’ says @entity34 , now of @entity37 , @entity12			1
‘ it 's a beautiful spectacle that i 'm able to witness close to home			2
my love for summers in the @entity12 has everything to do with the arrival of the silver magic			1
‘ tarpons and other predators hunt the silversides , but by swimming in unison they can escape and continue to grow bigger			0
’ each year millions of these silvery fish arrive in coastal waters between june and august			2
fascinating sight : the luminous fish create an underwater roof over the divers as they explore the @entity11 's @entity10 , which is home to thousands of the little fish protection : the small fish swim together and move in the same direction in order to confuse larger predators luring in the sea caves the fish create waves of silver light as they move around the grottos that lie beneath the surface of the @entity5 dinner time : a photograph taken in the middle of the gigantic shoal manages to capture a group of larger fish on the hunt for the small silversides the average length of a silverside fish is between one and four inches , and they hide in underwater grottos until they have grown big enough to survive on their own			1
@entity34 says : ‘ it makes you humble to witness nature at its best			0
‘ sometimes i lower my camera and just enjoy being in the middle of this spectacle and watch them moving in unison			0
‘ the first time i dived at this site i fell in love with the light under the water			0
‘ from then on i studied where natural light could reach the bottom , where the fish could hide and where the best angles were , all to create the best photographs i could and do the environment justice			2
‘ i keep going back again and again to capture the show and i ca n't get enough of it			0
‘ people are often surprised by the beauty the oceans hold , and they start to care and want to protect our planet , and that is my goal			0
