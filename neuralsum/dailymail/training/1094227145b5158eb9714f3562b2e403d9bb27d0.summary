by @entity0 prime minister @entity1 obviously forgot to refer to the @entity3 ' teamsheet on saturday when he awkwardly referred to @entity3 's captain @entity4 as ' @entity5 ' in a cringeworthy @entity7 video message			1
the patriotic - looking @entity1 , sporting a @entity3 scarf and standing before the @entity10 flag , delivered his stirring message of support to the @entity3 in a @entity14 message on saturday morning as they prepared to play in their first @entity7 match			1
but as if a 3 - 1 defeat to @entity17 was n't bad enough , the pm only managed to make it to the three - second mark before butchering his well intended message by referring to team captain @entity4 , as ' @entity5 ' , instead of @entity21			1
draped in @entity23 and @entity24 and the @entity10 flag in the background , the stage was set for mr @entity1 who just needed to do bit more research before delivering his message thankfully he did n't also have a problem with the coach , @entity30			1
' @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity3 , ' he said , ' in this @entity7 you have the opportunity to make the world game our national game '			2
he went on to say that the weight of a nation rests on the @entity3 ' shoulders and that the side , no matter how well they perform on the world stage , will have the country 's full support			0
' throughout this @entity7 we 'll burn the midnight oil as you take the field in our name			0
' ' we stand with you as you wear our colours into the world 's greatest team sporting event			0
' we 're behind you , we 're willing you on to victory and we know you 'll seize the moment			0
' if only the @entity1 had seized the moment to get the skipper 's name right			0
so close , yet so far : @entity1 was just one letter in the alphabet away from getting the socceroos captains name right			2

@entity1 made the *blunder* on @entity14 in message to @entity3
he was just three seconds in when *unknowingly* he called ' @entity21 ' , ' @entity5 '
the message did not stir the @entity3 on to victory , losing 3 - 1 to @entity17
socceroos play 2010 *runners* up @entity70 on june *19*
