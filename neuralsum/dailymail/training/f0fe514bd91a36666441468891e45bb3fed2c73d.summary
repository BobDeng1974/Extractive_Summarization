by @entity0 published : 16:15 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 16 august 2013 @entity0 gets tetchy and on - edge if she has n't worked out hard - even now this morning i was in the gym at 7am as usual , pushing my body as hard as i could			1
a workout is part of my routine six days out of seven			2
i 'll stay for an hour - up to two when there 's time - and unless i leave drenched with sweat , my muscles smarting and feel - good endorphins rushing through my body , i 'm tetchy and on edge for the rest of the day			1
even now : when i 'm eight months pregnant with my first baby			2
at a time when many women use their condition as an excuse to lounge on the sofa scoffing chocolate biscuits , i 'm as disciplined about diet and fitness as i 've ever been			2
i 'm not an athlete , so there 's no professional reason why i need to keep my body in shape			2
my outlook is more controversial			2
i 'm terrified that pregnancy will leave me fat and unfit			1
i 've been a slender size ten and extremely fit for my entire adult life			2
it 's such an integral part of my identity that the prospect of losing my figure makes me incredibly anxious			2
while i know i 'm not alone - from posts on online parenting forums i can see there are countless other women who feel just as i do - admitting that you are actively trying to maintain your figure in pregnancy seems to be taboo			1
until i was 17 weeks pregnant , i was running 10km several times a week , just as i have done for years			0
when that became too uncomfortable due to ligament pains as my body expanded , i hung up my running shoes and took on additional gym sessions - working up a sweat on the bike , rowing machine and cross trainer , as well as lifting weights and doing push - ups and leg lunges			1
while no one has said anything negative to me , i 've come across several other expectant mothers who have been subjected to vile comments from strangers who object to seeing a pregnant woman running , cycling or working out			0
i 'm just as disciplined about what i eat , too			0
i 've never been on a diet or suffered from an eating disorder , but since my teens i 've been controlled about what i eat to ensure i do n't put on weight			1
my diet is balanced , including plenty of lean protein , fruit and veg , but i eschew bread , pasta and rice			0
chips , cake and - pre-pregnancy - alcoholic drinks are for weekends only			1
i 've never eaten a bag of crisps or sweets in my adult life because i do n't like either and - other than alcohol - i 've only ever drunk water			1
no fruit juice , fizzy drinks , tea or coffee : i simply do n't like the taste			1
it 's still the same now			0
there 's been no pigging out on stodge for me , baby or no baby			0
of course , my unborn child is my priority			1
like any mum - to - be i 'm mainly concerned that he or she will be born healthy and my mothering skills will be up to scratch			1
but , while i 've revelled in discovering how my baby is developing inside me - the first scan reduced me and my husband , @entity103 , to tears of joyful disbelief , as did the baby 's first fluttery kicks - i 've been equally horrified by the changes happening on the outside			1
@entity0 , pictured left , and right at 30 weeks pregnant , says despite all her efforts there is still sponginess to her arms compared to many women my age - 40 - i know i 'm extremely fit and , usually , in good shape , but almost from the moment i discovered i was pregnant my bust got bigger and my waist thickened , making me feel self - conscious			1
and , despite all my efforts , there 's a sponginess softening my usually defined biceps and shoulders , a smattering of cellulite on my bottom that did n't exist before and a fullness in my face which all lead to one conclusion : pregnancy is making me fat and unattractive			1
and i 'm far from alone in my outlook			0
a recent study by @entity134 found that a quarter of pregnant @entity137 women are ' highly concerned about their weight and shape '			0
one in 14 expectant mums develop an eating disorder during pregnancy - often dubbed ' pregorexia ' - where they exercise and limit food intake to extremes			1
one poll asked women what they feared most during pregnancy			1
while 10 per cent said their greatest concern was complications with the birth , a staggering 65 per cent said that not losing the weight after their baby was born was far more worrying			0
the medical and academic worlds are finally acknowledging that fear of putting on weight while pregnant is not merely a matter of vanity , but a serious issue that can affect a woman 's mental health when she already feels vulnerable			0
@entity0 thinks pregnancy is making her unattractive i know there are people who will read this and assume i care more about staying slim than i do about my unborn baby			1
that could n't be further from the truth			1
i feel hugely responsible for its wellbeing and would never do anything that might harm it			0
my husband - who , after 15 years together , has long understood my physical and emotional need to exercise each day - has been supportive , while reassuring me he still thinks i look great			1
and my gp , obstetrician and midwife have all said - as @entity185 guidelines do - that since my body is so used to intense daily exercise it would be more dangerous to stop , unless i feel unwell or there was a medical reason to do so			1
people who say i 'm putting my needs before my baby 's welfare should focus on the expectant mums i see smoking outside the local maternity unit and those who eat for two ( you actually need only an extra 200 calories a day during pregnancy and only then in the final trimester )			1
research shows overweight women are not only more likely to have babies who go on to be obese adults , but that excess weight gain can trigger diabetes and life - threatening pre-eclampsia , and lead to foetal abnormalities			1
dr @entity208 , a consultant psychologist who is pregnant with her second child , believes there are several reasons why modern women are increasingly distressed by the way pregnancy changes our bodies			1
' we 're used to being able to control all the elements of our lives and our figures , but during pregnancy we ca n't do that , ' she says			1
' @entity224 taboos play a part , too			0
there 's still this message that pregnancy 's a wonderful thing , yet the truth can be very different			1
' your hormones are all over the place and you feel out of control , but saying anything negative is seen as a sign you do n't realise how lucky you are			1
' yet the happiness you feel about your unborn baby and the anxiety about your changing body are two separate things			0
' still , i have to admit i 'm well aware there have been times when i 've pushed myself too far and made myself feel ill because my fear of getting fat has outweighed the nausea , fatigue and often crippling pains that have beset my pregnancy			1
consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician @entity250 says exercising when pregnant is safe , though he urges caution			0
' i advise pregnant women not to let their pulse rate get above 140 beats per minute - you should still be able to hold a conversation - and to be careful not to overheat or get dehydrated , ' he says			2
' but if you 're inactive while pregnant then the chances are you 're going to gain excess weight , which puts you at higher risk of developing diabetes , requiring a caesarean birth , losing blood after labour and needing an emergency blood transfusion			0
' there 's also plenty of evidence that exercising and keeping weight gain within 21lb to 28lb is best for the baby , too , as exercise increases blood flow to the foetus , strengthening its heart , as well as minimising complications at birth			0
there have been occasions when it was tempting to lie in bed and do nothing but gorge on toast oozing with melted butter			0
i should have done that one morning last month when , instead , i went to the gym and then had to pull into a layby on the way home feeling dizzy and sick			0
despite waking up feeling below par that morning , my terror of fatness had over-ruled my fatigue			0
it was a wake - up call			2
now i accept that some days i need to take it easy			0
i 'll still go to the gym , but i 'll sit on the exercise bike rather than pump weights			0
health willing , however , i 'll still be in the gym the day before i give birth			0
how much weight have i gained ? i have no idea and do n't want to know			2
in fact , my midwife has weighed me only once , right at the start of my pregnancy , and was quite happy when i asked her not to tell me what the scales showed			2
although i can still fit my legs into my size - ten designer jeans , at 23 weeks pregnant i had to admit defeat			2
after a weekend in @entity310 wearing the jeans with a hair bobble holding the fly together because i could no longer do them up , i ordered a stash of maternity jeans			0
i know that the pressure i feel to be slim and fit comes entirely from me , not from friends or a family who abhor the very word ' diet '			0
neither do i feel any desire to look like celebrities			0
it 's simply that i 'm a perfectionist - always have been - and put myself under pressure to achieve in all areas of my life			2
that said , i do take notice of fellow fitness fanatics such as singers @entity332 and @entity334 , who are in incredible shape after recently having babies			0
far from condemning them for heaping pressure on ordinary women , i applaud them and find them inspiring			0
sure , the celebs have more time and money than the rest of us to indulge in personal trainers , chefs and home gyms after birth , but ultimately you ca n't buy @entity352 'm not ashamed to admit i fully intend to be back in my skinny jeans within 12 weeks of my baby 's arrival			2
and i 'll be exercising again as soon as is medically safe .			0

@entity0 gets tetchy and on - edge if she has n't worked out hard
*addiction* has n't ceased at all during pregnancy
fears carrying child is making her fat and unattractive
