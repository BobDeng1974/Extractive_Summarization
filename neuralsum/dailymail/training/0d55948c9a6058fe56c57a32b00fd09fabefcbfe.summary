the 2014 - 15 @entity1 season started on tuesday in dramatic style as defending champions @entity3 beat the @entity4 101 - 100 in the @entity5			1
the @entity3 , overriding favourites to defend their crown having won it in such a convincing manner last term , needed a late three - pointer from @entity11 - who scored 23 points in total - to clinch victory			1
before tip - off , @entity3 staff and players were presented with their championship rings			0
the inscription inside the ring was ' @entity20 ' , which was coach @entity22 's mantra last season			0
@entity24 ( right ) hit 14 points as the @entity3 opened the new season with a win @entity28 power forward @entity24 is fouled during the first game of the new @entity1 season @entity11 dives for the hoop as @entity4 ' @entity32 tries to block his spectacular effort @entity11 celebrates at the buzzer as @entity3 opened their season with a dramatic win coach @entity22 receives his @entity1 championship ring ahead of the game with the @entity39 @entity3 players ( from left ) @entity24 , @entity42 and @entity11 poses with their championship rings the @entity3 were imperious throughout the regular season last time around , boasting a sensational win - loss record of 62 - 20			1
the franchise took this form into the play - offs which culminated in their 4 - 1 thrashing in the best - of - seven @entity51 series against the @entity52			1
in coach @entity22 they have someone who understands when to utilise his squad and how to maximise their talents too			0
criticisms of @entity3 in the past have been that they are an ageing side - but the experience of @entity11 , @entity24 , @entity11 and @entity42 is brilliantly off - set by @entity61			0
the 23 - year - old was the @entity51 ' mvp last season and his qualities on both side of the floor will be a key component to a cohesive @entity3 side			1
@entity42 ( right ) is experienced and impressed against the @entity4 in @entity3 on tuesday before tip - off the @entity3 unveiled their latest championship banner @entity3 ' likely threats in the @entity72 are likely to come from the @entity73 , @entity74 and the @entity75			2
the @entity76 - who travelled to the @entity78 to face the @entity79 on tuesday - are likely to struggle following the departures of two starters in @entity82 and @entity32			2
over in the @entity83 , the @entity5 is shaping up to be one of the most hotly - contested in years			2
@entity85 ' ( right ) move back to the @entity86 has made them strong contenders out in the @entity83 all of the pre-season focus has been on @entity85 ' move back to the @entity86 from the @entity52			1
the four - time mvp won successive @entity1 titles with @entity52 , in 2012 and 2013 , as he formed an unbelievable trio with @entity93 and @entity94			1
@entity96 ' return to the @entity86 immediately makes them a dangerous franchise to be reckoned with			0
in @entity98 they have a star in the making alongside @entity85 , and the acquisition of @entity102 from the @entity103 only makes them stronger			0
however , the pressure on @entity86 to deliver so soon is a season premature considering they finished outside the play - off spots last year			0
@entity52 will be relying heavily on the talents of @entity94 ( left ) following @entity85 ' departure for the @entity52 , despite the loss of @entity85 coach @entity111 's can still rely on the talents of @entity94 and @entity93			0
@entity52 have contested the last four @entity51 series and the experience within their squad should see them come at least close to matching that feat again			2
the additions of @entity120 and @entity122 ’s @entity121 means success should continue to roll at the @entity124			0
arguably the team that both the @entity52 and @entity86 will be most wary of is the @entity126			1
@entity127 's ( left ) from two serious knee injuries and the signing of @entity130 ( left of second picture ) make the @entity126 strong contenders for the @entity134 title this season the @entity126 finished fourth in the @entity83 last season but have been strongly tipped to go all the way in the @entity5 this campaign			1
in centre @entity138 , they have the current defensive player of the year - and his tough - to - beat traits reflect that of coach @entity144 ’s mindset			0
the signing of @entity130 adds some much needed offense but it is the return of @entity127 from injury that has increased expectations at the @entity148			0
after suffering two serious knee injuries the 2011 @entity62 looks fit once more and ready to lead @entity126 back to their @entity150 - inspired dominance in the 1990s			1
@entity150 ( right ) led the @entity126 to six @entity51 titles during the 1990s			2

2014 - 15 @entity1 season started with three games in the @entity5
defending champions @entity3 beat @entity4 , @entity79 lost to @entity76 and @entity158 beat @entity159
@entity3 ' *mix* of experience and *youth* makes them favourites to defend their titles in the @entity5 and their @entity51 crown
@entity126 are expected to *challenge* out in the @entity134 with the return of a fit @entity127 after two serious knee injuries
four - time mvp @entity85 ' move from @entity52 to @entity86 makes them a team to watch this season out in the @entity83
