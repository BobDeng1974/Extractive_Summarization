an owl breeder has come up with a novel idea to help him tell his young fledglings apart - by giving them brightly coloured manicures			2
@entity6 , 63 , was worried that the baby owls at @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity10 , look so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them , which can be fatal for the birds			1
so he instructed workers at the farm to varnish the claws of each fluffy owlet using nail polish in their very own ' talon salon '			1
the first born @entity20 is given orange talons , the second hatched has theirs painted purple and for the third born , pink			2
staff use ordinary nail varnish for the job staff at the farm park have to feed baby mice to the little owlets within 12 hours of hatching and initially three or four times every day			1
but after three days their feeds reduce to three times a day and , by two months , they need to eat twice a day mr @entity6 said : ' it is just normal ladies ' nail varnish			1
it is as simple as that			0
it is important to keep accurate records and it is important to not to overfeed any one of the single owls			2
' so to make sure we can see the ages we do this			0
they all look very similar ' mr @entity6 said : ' it is just normal ladies ' nail varnish			1

' so to make sure we can see the ages we do this			0
they all look very similar			2
' we paint the nails then we know which ones have been fed and which ones have not			2
' it also means that we know exactly which is first born and second born , or hatched rather , and so on			0
@entity40 applies purple nail paint to a baby tawny owl			1
the fledglings look so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them , which can be fatal for the birds mr @entity6 , who has been breeding owls for 22 years , said the risks of overfeeding can be fatal			1
he added : ' @entity91 need to eat more food the older they get but if you do overfeed them it can be very dangerous			0
the food just sits in the stomach ' @entity6 applies nail paint to a baby tawny owl which hatched on april 8			1
the owls talons are simply painted and not filed in any way ' so each one family member in one clutch is painted a different colour depending on when they were born			1
' we have for instance three @entity20 from one clutch , or family , so we have painted their nails three different colours according to when they were hatched			2
' mr @entity6 , who has been breeding owls for 22 years , said the risks of overfeeding can be fatal			1
he added : ' @entity91 need to eat more food the older they get but if you do overfeed them it can be very dangerous			0
the food just sits in the stomach			0
' it is a bit like us having a really heavy lunch or dinner			0
they just lie there and they are not in any way active			0
painted nails on a baby tawny owl			1
the new owls will go to other farm parks , zoos , breeding centres or private collectors when they are old enough ' it should be a lesson for us all really			1
something to remember next time we have a @entity137			0
' staff at the farm park have to feed baby mice to the little owlets within 12 hours of hatching and initially three or four times every day			1
but after three days their feeds reduce to three times a day and , by two months , they need to eat twice a day			0
they are fully grown at three - months - old and are able to break up the food themselves			0
animal carer @entity40 said : ' in the wild , owls only live three to five years but in captivity they live a lot longer			0
' we have a @entity20 that is about 20 years old			0
he was rescued from the @entity157 area of the county by @entity6 and he is still here			1
' the new owls will go to other farm parks , zoos , breeding centres or private collectors when they are old enough .			2
