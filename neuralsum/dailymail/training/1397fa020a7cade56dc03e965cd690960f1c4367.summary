the resurgent @entity0 does not want an endorsement from celebrity activist @entity2 , party sources have revealed			1
there had been mounting speculation that the comedian - turned - anarchist – who has worked with leaders of the left - wing environmental party in recent years – would be unveiled as the ‘ green @entity10 ’			1
but senior party sources claimed they did n’t need an answer to the charismatic @entity14 leader			1
the resurgent @entity0 does not want an endorsement from celebrity activist @entity2 , party sources have revealed one said that if such an offer were to be made to mr @entity2 , it should be declined because his ‘ controversial ’ reputation would be ‘ toxic ’ to some potential voters			1
‘ it might seem like a good idea for two or three days but i suspect it would quickly turn into a nightmare , ’ the source added			0
last year @entity0 leader @entity26 joined mr @entity2 to address 1,200 people at an anti-austerity rally in @entity29			1
he has also worked with @entity31 mp @entity30 , to get the @entity32 to debate drug policy			1
but ms @entity26 said last month that the party did not need ‘ big personalities ’ to be a success at the ballot box			1
she insisted it wanted to concentrate on serious issues and not be led by a person who ‘ tosses their hair around and waves a pint ’			0
two separate polls this week confirmed a dramatic surge in support for the @entity48			0
a @entity50 poll showed them securing 10 per cent of the vote , with @entity54 support at its lowest since 2010			0
the @entity48 were on 9 per cent in a survey of voting intentions by @entity57 – a rise of four per cent in just one month			0
that is the party ’s highest rating for two decades			1
@entity30 , @entity0 mp for @entity62 , said : ' i do not recognise the sentiment in these quotes			0
one said that if such an offer were to be made to mr @entity2 , it should be declined because his ‘ controversial ’ reputation would be ‘ toxic ’ to some potential voters ' i 've worked closely with @entity2 to promote a more evidence - based , effective and humane approach to drugs policy and appreciate all he has done to put the issue on the political agenda			1
he has effectively rattled the cage of @entity76 and it is right that he has - @entity78 need to do far more to regain people 's trust and confidence			0
' a party spokesman added that it and mr brand ' both believe there is a positive alternative to austerity economics and recognise that the politics of the future does not have to look like the politics of the past '			1
@entity90 - born miss @entity26 has taken the @entity48 to new heights since miss @entity30 , previously the most high profile figure in the party , stepped down from the role in 2012			2
polling suggests @entity54 and the @entity97 risk being engulfed by a ' @entity98 ' which pollsters could cost @entity100 up to 17 seats at the election			0
the @entity48 appear to be doing particularly well among students and other younger voters , as well as peeling off some of the disaffected @entity105 who switched to labour when their former party entered coalition with the conservatives			1
there are growing fears among @entity78 that the @entity48 - who have now been invited to take part in leaders ' tv debates - could disrupt mr @entity100 's alleged ' 35 per cent strategy ' of winning power with @entity54 's core vote plus another five or six per cent coming from disillusioned former @entity97			2
@entity119 , head of polling firm @entity120 , said a @entity31 vote share of nine per cent could cost @entity54 seventeen seats , which most of which would be won by the @entity124			0
he said a @entity31 tide in crucial university cities and towns could pose ‘ a real problem for @entity54 ’			0
@entity26 , the leader of the @entity0 , once joined mr @entity2 to address 1,200 people at an anti-austerity rally in @entity29			1
the party has seen a huge rush of membership applications in recent weeks after @entity135 refused to take part in tv debates unless the @entity48 were excluded			1
the @entity138 said it was not fair to include some minor parties like @entity14 and the @entity97 but not others			0
the @entity48 say their party rolls now approach 48,000 , giving it more members than @entity14 who have around 42,000 and the @entity97 on some 45,000			2
membership numbers have doubled in the past 12 months			0
miss @entity26 said this week that the party was targeting 12 seats in may			2
but she told @entity148 it was possible that given the growth in support in recent weeks it could do even better			2
the @entity48 support radical policies including slashing funding for roads , ditching the @entity156 nuclear defence system and a raft of taxes on the wealthy – which appeal to disaffected left wing voters			2
the last time the @entity48 threatened the political establishment was in 1989 when they secured 2.2 million votes in @entity163 parliamentary elections			0
last week mr @entity100 made a direct pitch to @entity31 voters vowing to build more wind farms and saying that environmental issues were ' at the heart ' of his beliefs .			0

@entity2 has worked with leaders of the party in recent years
there have been *rumours* comedian would become ' @entity176 '
but senior party sources say his reputation would be ' toxic ' to voters
