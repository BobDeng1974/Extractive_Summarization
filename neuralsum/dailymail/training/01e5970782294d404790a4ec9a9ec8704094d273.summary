by @entity0 published : 19:56 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 18 july 2013 callers spent £ 56million on premium - rate government phone lines last year – with half their time spent on hold			1
factoring in the value of time waiting to speak to a ‘ real person ’ would bring the actual cost closer to £ 150million , said spending watchdog the @entity9			0
its report found that despite attempts to limit them , ‘ 084 ’ numbers continue to be used ‘ extensively ’ across @entity14			1
nearly half of the 120 phone lines served vulnerable or low - income groups such as pensioners , the bereaved , pregnant women and the unemployed , who faced ‘ eye - watering ’ costs			1
the taxman , the @entity21 , a redundancy helpline , the @entity23 and the @entity25 information line aimed at children all use the lines			1
however , the @entity9 said £ 26million was spent by callers just waiting for an advisor to pick up the phone			0
in total people spent 880million minutes on premium calls and nearly half of that time was spent on hold			0
its report said : ‘ in addition to the direct charges for calling government telephone lines , there is an opportunity cost to callers of the time spent waiting on calls			1
‘ assuming that callers value their time at around 25p per minute , the value of time waiting on higher rate lines would be £ 100 million			1
’ it said that estimating the value of the time lost was a ‘ useful measure ’ that should make departments assess the quality of their phone services			0
the @entity9 called for government departments dealing with vulnerable or low - income people to stop using 084 numbers			1
those connected to the costly lines spent nearly half their time - 46 per cent or 402million minutes - waiting to speak to an advisor callers spent 1.45 billion minutes connected to government phone lines , of which 880 million minutes were on higher rate lines			2
those connected to the costly lines spent nearly half their time – 46 per cent or 402 million minutes – waiting to speak to an advisor			2
there were also glaring inconsistencies between departments , with some using the lines while others gave out toll free or lower cost numbers on local dialling codes			1
the worst offenders were the @entity76 , the @entity77 and @entity78			0
the @entity79 is the only major department to rule out the use of 084 numbers			1
some 63 per cent of all telephone calls to government phone lines were made to the premium cost lines , which are also used by 8 per cent of @entity85 in @entity86 and 4 per cent of local authorities			2
@entity88 , chairman , of the @entity89 , said the amounts being shelled out to use them were ‘ eye watering ’			0
she added : ‘ it is not acceptable that vulnerable people are facing some of the highest charges to call central government about important issues such as benefits and redundancy			0
’ she called for regulator @entity100 to ‘ get to grips ’ with the ‘ confusing charging system ’			0
@entity103 , head of the @entity9 , said : ‘ the most vulnerable callers , such as low - income households , face some of the highest charges			0
’ the average call cost to 0844 numbers is 5.6p from a landline and 17.1p a minute from a mobile			2
for 0845 numbers , it costs 4.2p a minute from a landline and 17.6p from a mobile			2
but local code numbers are usually 3.4p from a landline and 1.1p a minute from a mobile , while 03 numbers are usually the same rate			0
@entity119 , of the @entity121 campaign , said the ‘ penal cost ’ of 084 numbers was ‘ disenfranchising ’ many from accessing government services and @entity126 mp @entity125 , who has called for a ban on the ‘ scandalous ’ use of 084 numbers , said callers had no choice but to use them , however , they are charged ‘ rip - off rates ’			1
@entity78 has already switched to 03 numbers for its busiest lines and pledged to phase out higher rate numbers			1
the @entity76 had also promised free calls from mobiles to its 0800 benefit claims hotlines			0
changing all higher rate helplines to 03 numbers would save callers £ 29 million a year , while using only to 0800 numbers would save £ 46 million , says the @entity9 .			0

despite attempts to limit them , ' 084 ' numbers still used across @entity14
