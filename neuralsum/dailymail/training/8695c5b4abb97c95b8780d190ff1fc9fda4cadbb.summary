@entity0 thinks @entity1 will become an even better striker if he plays for @entity3 at the @entity4 this summer			1
two years ago @entity1 was going through a miserable loan spell at @entity6 , but given his recent form , it would not be a surprise if he scored the winner for @entity11 in the @entity13 final against @entity14 on sunday			2
@entity1 has scored 24 goals for @entity11 this term and is almost certain to earn his first senior @entity3 call - up in three weeks ' time			2
@entity1 strikes a penalty against @entity20 , which led to his 14th @entity22 goal of the season @entity1 's excellent form , including two goals against @entity14 , makes it likely he will get an @entity3 call - up this june @entity3 's youngsters travel to the @entity29 for the @entity31 - 21 championships			0
seniors manager @entity32 has told under - 21 coach @entity33 he can pick any eligible senior player and @entity0 thinks @entity1 would profit from the experience of playing in the youth tournament - even though he is likely to be a full international by then			1
' it 's the best eight teams in @entity39 , and it 's the next big international tournament to a senior one , ' said @entity41 technical director @entity0			1
' there are pressures , there are challenges of international football that ca n't always be replicated in club football and it 's the nearest thing he 's going to get to hopefully going on and winning something for @entity3 seniors as well			0
it would be immensely beneficial for him and any other player going			0
there are concerns about over-playing @entity1 , who was rested for thursday 's @entity58 defeat @entity1 has already played 10 times for the under - 21 side , and will be eligible for the @entity62 championships @entity1 has scored eight times for @entity33 's side , and @entity0 wants him to stick with them ' i 'm sure @entity33 would love to have him going with the 21s			1
' @entity1 has been a regular in @entity33 's team since he took over from @entity69 as @entity71 coach			2
@entity69 left his post after guiding the team through a dismal euros two years ago			0
@entity3 lost all three group stage matches and failed to score from open play			0
@entity0 is optimistic about the team 's chances of success this time around though , thanks partly to @entity1 's form and that of @entity81 , who topped the scoring charts in qualifying with 10 goals in 10 appearances			1
the likes of @entity86 ( left ) and @entity87 are also eligible for the young lions several senior players like @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity86 , @entity92 , @entity87 , @entity93 and @entity94 are also eligible for selection , but @entity0 concedes @entity33 will have to take a pragmatic approach to squad selection			1
' it 's our duty as a national association to try and get our best players and most appropriate players to go to every single tournament , ' said @entity0 , who was @entity105 technical director before joining the @entity41			1
' we want to win it			0
that 's important to me and it 's important to us			0
' that 's not necessarily at the expense of ruining a relationship with a club or a player that 's played consecutively for three successive seasons and has never had a summer break			0

@entity1 has been in *superb* form for @entity11 this season
striker is likely to play for @entity32 's senior team next month
but @entity41 's @entity0 believes he should take part in youth tournament
@entity32 has said @entity33 can pick any eligible players
@entity87 , @entity94 and @entity86 could all play
