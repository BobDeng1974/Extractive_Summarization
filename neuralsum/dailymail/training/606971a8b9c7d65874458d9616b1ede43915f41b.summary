by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:58 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 04:49 est , 13 december 2013 @entity2 has been forced from his home by an @entity5 law which protects endangered birds having lovingly worked the land on their farm for more than 30 years , @entity2 was looking forward to passing the estate to his sons when the time came for him to retire			1
but the former army officer told last night how that dream has been shattered after he was forced from his home by @entity5 laws that put the ‘ rights of birds above humans ’			1
mr @entity2 , 79 , said he and his wife @entity19 , 78 , had to leave their farm of 30 years with ‘ a gun to their heads ’ because of @entity26 regulations that allow the @entity27 to flood the land to encourage breeding of endangered birds			1
he said they were ‘ devastated ’ at having to leave 60 - acre @entity31 in @entity32 , on the @entity33 , and being denied the chance to pass it on to their three sons			0
taxpayers are also understood to have been left with a seven - figure bill as part of a deal to rehome the couple			0
‘ we did n’t want to go but we had no hope of defeating @entity26 law			0
neither did the @entity46 government , ’ mr @entity2 said			2
‘ i am not a political person , but this is a worrying example of how @entity26 law affects ordinary people			0
’ under the plan , raised water levels will flood the farm and surrounding land to create breeding grounds for wildfowl including brent geese , widgeons , shovellers , lapwings and redshanks			1
‘ it has forced us out of our home because it effectively values the rights of birds above the rights of human beings , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
‘ we are broken - hearted			0
’ the couple ’s ordeal began when the @entity27 asked the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) , which manages @entity46 ’s waterways , to allow increased flooding from the nearby @entity74 river to encourage more breeding sites for rare species			2
mr @entity2 worked the land at @entity31 on the @entity33 for more than 30 years			1
he was looking forward to handing it down to his sons but told how his dreams have been shattered mr @entity2 said that would have rendered his land unusable but , because the land is within an @entity5 @entity83 , he was told that if he fought the decision the @entity27 could take him to the @entity26 courts			1
the @entity5 has strict legislation aimed at protecting wild birds and attempting to halt their decline			2
as part of this , it designates @entity83 ( @entity92 ) around @entity26 to encourage endangered species			2
@entity31 on the @entity33 became part of an @entity83 that incorporates the @entity95 and @entity96 in 1998			0
spas are covered by the @entity5 ’s @entity98 , which aims to provide ‘ a strict system of species protection ’ for birds			2
this includes regulations that nations must ‘ maintain or restore natural habitats of @entity106 interest ’			0
the @entity27 had already bought 420 acres from @entity31 – which is on land reclaimed from the sea – and allowed it to flood to create habitats for wildfowl			1
but the charity now wants to raise water levels further , which will affect the adjacent farm			2
mr @entity2 was given legal advice that he would have no chance of overturning the decision because of the strict @entity5 laws covering @entity92			1
he was left to reluctantly accept what he called a ‘ fair offer ’ for the land from the @entity70			0
he said : ‘ we do not blame the @entity70			0
their hands were also tied by @entity124 and they have done everything they can for us in the circumstances			0
‘ but it is a very sad situation			0
we have been forced into this agreement with a gun to our heads because it was made abundantly clear to us that under @entity26 law there was no other option			2
‘ it was excellent land which we used to grow hay for our horses and for around 100 sheep to graze			0
‘ when the river level rises the land is expected to be at the very least waterlogged and unusable			0
’ but he said the their ‘ greatest sadness ’ was not being able to pass on the estate to their three sons , who work as a psychologist , a doctor and a lawyer			0
‘ that has always been the plan , ’ he said			0
mr @entity2 , whose grandfather was born nearby , bought the farm after a 27 - year @entity156 career during which he served in the @entity158 crisis			1
at the time it was within a @entity160 – which is designated by @entity161 – and mr @entity2 said there was no suggestion water levels would be raised to protect birds			1
an @entity5 regulation means the farm can be flooded by the @entity27 to encourage breeding for endangered birds			1
mr @entity2 said the law puts the ' rights of birds above humans ' but in october 1998 the land was designated part of an @entity5 @entity83			1
soon afterwards the family sold 420 acres of the farm to the @entity27 to help comply with @entity5 regulations , so mr @entity2 was surprised about the new plan that will flood their remaining land			1
the @entity27 said the @entity83 was operating ‘ far below optimum ’ and raising water levels on its land – thereby flooding the adjacent farm – was the ‘ final piece in the jigsaw ’			1
a spokesman for the charity denied there had been any threat of legal action , saying : ‘ the @entity27 ’s role is the management and restoration of our own part of this potentially exceptional wildlife site			0

@entity2 and @entity198 left their home ' with a gun to their heads '
@entity5 regulation allows @entity27 to flood the land to encourage breeding of endangered species
raised water levels will flood the farm to create a habitat for wildfowl including brent geese , widgeons , shovellers , lapwings and redshanks
mr @entity2 said : ' it has forced us out of our home because it effectively values the rights of birds above the rights of human beings '
