@entity14 charity @entity12 had bought 25 tickets for the @entity3 : best of @entity5 caberet show for injured @entity18 veterans recovering at the @entity20 rehabilition unit in @entity21			1
but the trip to tonight 's @entity24 show was cancelled by @entity25 , group captain @entity26 because the show is too risqu√©			1
according to @entity29 , the charity is appealing for other groups with links to the @entity14 to come forward if they want the tickets			1
they have even been offered to the @entity34			0
the @entity37 's @entity36 show is part of the nine day @entity39 which is now in its seventh year			1
@entity12 , which works to reintegrate military casualties with a variety of injuries into society , had booked tonight 's earlier of two showings so that the troops were n't too tired and so that the wheelchairs could be accommodated more easily			2
tonight 's show , at @entity50 , features acts such as @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity1			2
but @entity54 , production manager of the show , told @entity56 that the @entity10 have got the wrong impression about what burlesque consists of			2
she said : ' we 've been working with the charity for a while on this , we always try and help charities who want to make group bookings			0

recovering : injured troops are treated at @entity20 rehabilitation centre in @entity21 ' the unfortunate thing is that the charity loses out on the money - we ca n't offer them a refund because the show 's sold out - it 's left a bit of a difficult situation			1
' the saddest thing is that when i spoke to the charity , she said that the soldiers were really disappointed			2
@entity88 : @entity54 ( not pictured ) , the shows production manager , says that burlesque is tasteful and that some people still have the wrong impression of it ' burlesque is just a harmless bit of fun and it 's so huge now that it 's quite rare for people to have this kind of opinion on it			0
' it 's all very tasteful and all in the style of glamorous burlesque and we also have a variety of cabaret acts on stage too			2
' whoever it was ( that cancelled the trip ) has probably got the wrong impression of what it 's all about - some people associate it with seedy strip clubs and it 's completely the opposite to that			0
' she added : ' burlesque has been around for a long time and in the 1930s , 40s and 50s famous dancers of the time performed for the troops and that was sixty years ago and was fine then			0
' now people have this strange opinion of it - it would 've been nice to continue that tradition			0
' festival organiser @entity131 told @entity29 : ' it 's classic , glamourous and tasteful			0
it 's not a seedy show by any means			0
' you could take your granny to it			0
' an @entity10 spokesperson said : ' @entity20 has a strong relationship with a number of charities who provide generous gifts for our injured @entity146			1
' on this occasion we felt the offer was inappropriate however we are grateful to charities and the general public for their continued support for the @entity14			1
