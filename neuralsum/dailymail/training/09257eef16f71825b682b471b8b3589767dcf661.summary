by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:05 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:59 est , 22 december 2013 exclusion zones could be set up around tourist hotspots and major public areas to stop an expected surge of @entity9 migrants sleeping rough and harassing passers - by with aggressive begging , @entity3 can reveal			1
new powers called @entity13 ( @entity14 ) which come into operation next april will be deployed to stop gangs of homeless @entity17 squatting around some of the country ’s most famous landmarks and transport hubs			1
the move comes as @entity23 and @entity24 are handed unrestricted working rights in the @entity26 from january 1 , prompting fears that up to 50,000 people from those countries will come here every year for the next five years			1
police have been given new powers to enforce a rough sleeping ' exclusion zone ' around tourist hotspots in @entity33 the new powers could be used to create no - go areas around @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 – scenes of an 18 - month fight to remove @entity9 squatters			1
this proposal has been backed by @entity42 , conservative mp for the @entity43 , who favours using the @entity14 to create an extensive no - go zone around @entity37 , including @entity46			1
and he predicted that with the expected rise in immigration , other councils around the country would follow suit			2
‘ i hope that come january 1 we ’re not going to have a major problem with @entity24 and @entity23 , but i think it could be quite a big problem , ’ he said			0
‘ and it wo n’t be just a problem for @entity33 , it will apply to other parts of the country			1
it could become a major issue of social unrest , if we are not careful			0
’ ironically mr @entity42 ’s remarks come as he warns the prime minister not to ‘ bang on ’ about immigration because it would alienate minority ethnic voters			0
but he said there was no contradiction between calling for sensible measures to combat antisocial behaviour and getting the tone right on immigration			0
councillor @entity75 , head of community protection at @entity77 , said it had struggled to stop 50 - strong groups of @entity24 setting up camp			2
and she added : ‘ we ’ve got a major problem now			0
’ preventative measures : the new powers could be used to create a no - go area around @entity37 in @entity33 - the scene of an 18 - month fight to remove @entity9 squatters @entity89 , head of safety at @entity91 in @entity92 , said he would consider using @entity14			1
his comments come after a group of 68 @entity24 were evicted from a vermin - infested camp set up on a local football pitch in june			2
he said : ‘ it is a major concern in residents ’ minds that there ’s going to be a major influx again			0
’ but a @entity102 insisted no plans have yet been put in place to use @entity105			0
she said : ' @entity77 is not planning to create ' exclusion ' zones around @entity37			2
this piece of legislation will not come into effect until april 2014 and we will consider our options then			0
' @entity114 , leader of @entity115 , said there had been a rise in aggressive begging , particularly coming up to @entity119			0
he predicted @entity14 would ‘ undoubtedly ’ be used to target anti-social behaviour			1
mr @entity114 said : ‘ we do have significant pockets where migrants are presenting some problems			0
these powers will be exceedingly useful			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity127 said @entity14 – part of the @entity129 currently going through @entity130 – would speed up councils ’ ability to stamp out problems			1
he added : ‘ we are bringing in new , fast and adaptable powers to make it quicker and easier for local authorities to protect their communities while protecting the freedoms of law - abiding people			1

tourist hotspots in @entity33 could be protected by new ' no - go ' zones
police have *welcomed* the ' useful new powers ' - called @entity13 ( @entity14 )
