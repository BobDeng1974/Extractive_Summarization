life after @entity1 got off to a stuttering start for @entity3 as they were made to work hard by @entity4 at @entity5 , before emerging victorious			1
saints , who had sold three of their stars to @entity11 ' side this summer , put up a strong fight , coming from behind with @entity13 cancelling out @entity15 's opener			0
but @entity16 struck from close range late on to give the hosts a winning start to the season			1
@entity22 's @entity21 gives his opinion on the performances from both sets of players			0
encouraging @entity56 debut from the @entity57 , who will improve with games – 7 @entity59 – played with experience and composure			0
looking to form a solid partnership with @entity63 , could n’t get to @entity13 with a last ditch tackle when @entity4 equalised – 7 @entity63 – given an acerbic reception by his old supporters but never paid any attention ; a couple of robust challenges and some excellent long passing made this an impressive debut – 7 saving the day : @entity44 had to be at his best to deny @entity4 , tipping one strike brilliantly onto the bar well - know opponent : @entity63 was making his @entity3 debut against his former club @entity78 – facing a fight to maintain his position as a regular starter ; made one crucial block to deny @entity84 a certain goal but looked uncomfortable on the left flank – 5.5 @entity87 – steady without being spectacular from the captain , never wasted a pass and had more of an influence when @entity91 was replaced by @entity92 – 7 @entity91 – chosen ahead of @entity94 for his experience but saw his afternoon end prematurely when replaced by @entity92 after failing to exert a significant influence – 5 @entity32 – played the pass of the match to set @entity15 scampering away for @entity3 ’s opening goal ; his usual honest , energetic performance – 7 @entity101 – a @entity102 with a number of gifts but this was an afternoon when he spent too long on the periphery , failing to provide any kind of service for @entity16 – 5 encouraging : @entity101 ( left ) showed few flashes of his quality , never really unlocking the @entity4 defence @entity15 – took his goal with great style and threatened to give @entity4 nightmares with his speed on the counter ; came up with the crucial head on to provide the winner for @entity16 – 8.5 @entity16 – got involved early , with a shot that fizzed wide and a shout for a penalty , but then disappeared from view for long spells , until popping up when it mattered – 6.5 @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity125 – powerless to prevent either of @entity3 ’s goals but was n’t overly - worked on his @entity56 debut			1
did n’t have to make a save of note – 6.5 solid : @entity125 , who could do little about either @entity3 goal , beats away a shot from @entity15 @entity13 – full of invention and energy , took his goal with the confidence and swagger of someone with much more experience			1
will be pushing for an @entity40 call on this evidence – 7 @entity143 – did n’t have his normal partner to back him up but made no difference ; he carried on tackling and controlling @entity4 ’s defence , impressed with some hefty late challenges – 7.5 @entity148 – perhaps lucky to get away with a silly tackle on @entity16 in the first half but , otherwise , was n’t given a difficult afternoon by @entity16 – 6.5 new saint : @entity150 was one of eight new signings to make their debut at @entity5 on target : @entity13 smashed home after bursting into the @entity3 box to draw @entity4 level @entity150 – honest and hard - working , he covered miles down the left flank			1
could n’t cut out the cross that ultimately led to @entity3 ’s late winner – 7 @entity162 – protected @entity4 ’s defence with great diligence , caused problems for @entity3 with his muscular aggression when he powered forward			2
did n’t deserve to be on the losing side – 7.5 @entity51 – no doubting his commitment to @entity4 here ; tackled relentlessly , covered miles and was desperately unlucky late on not to secure @entity4 a point – 8 @entity172 – will spend the next week running over the chance he fluffed in front of @entity176 to give @entity4 what would have been a crucial lead			0
his face told the story – 6 prolific : @entity182 made more successful tackles in the first half than the whole @entity3 team @entity186 – superb afternoon from the @entity187 international , full of energy and invention			0
a number of fine set piece deliveries and kept running into dangerous areas – 8 @entity193 – @entity4 look to have bought well , as he caused @entity195 trouble all afternoon and provided a magnificent back heel pass to @entity13			2
standing ovation from away fans when he was substituted – 8 @entity200 – struggled to make any kind of impression and was kept under a tight - rein by @entity63 and @entity59			0
did n’t have any chance to cause problems – 5 good start : @entity193 impressed on debut for @entity4 , laying on a goal for @entity13 with a lovely touch referee – @entity211 attendance – 44,736			2

@entity15 puts @entity3 ahead in first half
@entity13 strikes back to level for @entity4
@entity16 wins the game for @entity3 with late close - range goal
@entity44 makes *stunning* late save to preserve the three points
