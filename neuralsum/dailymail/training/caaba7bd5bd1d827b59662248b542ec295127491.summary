taxpayers are being charged $ 33 million to save 800 birds who are living on an old section of the @entity5 - @entity4 which is no longer in use			1
the double - crested cormorants , which are protected but not endangered , have lived on a decrepit section of the bridge for decades			1
despite the eastern section of the bridge being replaced with a new $ 6.4m span , the birds have refused to relocate , meaning officials have been unable to dismantle the old section which was damaged in the @entity17 earthquake			1
taxpayers are footing a $ 33 million bill to help relocate 800 double - crested comorants who have lived under a now replaced section of the @entity5 - @entity4 for decades officials have unsuccessfully used pricey decoys , bird recordings and have placed specially - made nests planted on the new bridge , to lure the birds some 100 feet			1
critics say relocating the birds could end up costing them $ 33m			2
given only 800 birds live on the bridge , the cost of moving each one is about $ 40,000			2
radio show host @entity34 said that figure was ' more than most people in the @entity38 make in a given year '			0
@entity39 reports that relocation are set to soar further , because once the birds start laying eggs in february , the demolition process must stop completely			1
taxpayers are spending another $ 12m to fast - track the process and a further million for netting to prevent more birds from settling in			2
and that 's not the end of it			0
transport officials say they 'll probably need more time and money to complete the job			0
the eastern section of the bridge , damaged 25 years ago during the @entity17 earthquake , was replaced at a cost of $ 6.4 million , and officials now want to dismantle it oficials say they are bound by the law , and if they do n't follow it , taxpayers could face an even bigger bill nearly a quarter of a million cars use the bridge each date			1
the western section , which is a suspension bridge and links @entity5 to @entity74 , and the eastern section , which connects the island with @entity4			0
callers to mr @entity34 's radio show offered less costly and speedier solutions to the bird problems , from blasting them with fire hoses , to hiring rocker and hunter @entity83 to shoot them with his bow and arrow			0
mr @entity34 blamed bird protection laws written in 1918 for the problem , but said changing the laws in the @entity90 would be hopeless			0
he said : ' you would have to go through hell and high water because there are so many avowed environmentalists that want that set in stone because , i believe , they see us as the invasive species			0
' @entity103 spokesperson @entity102 said the agency was required to follow the law and if they did n't do so , the penalties they could face ' could far exceed ' the bird relocation costs			1
the demolition of the original section of the bridge is not expected to be completed until 2018 .			0

birds are protected , but not endangered , and have lived there for decades
the old section was damaged in the @entity17 earthquake and is decrepit
and has already been replaced by a $ 6.4 million new span
officials have used bird decoys , recordings and specially designed nests
in february the birds will lay eggs , and its *feared* relocation costs will soar
