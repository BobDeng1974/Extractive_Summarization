@entity0 is determined to guide @entity1 back into the @entity2 , admitting that he misses playing in @entity4 's grandest competition			1
the @entity6 superstar helped @entity7 to @entity9 glory this year before moving to @entity1 and the @entity10 in a £ 60million deal back in august			1
with @entity1 absent from the @entity2 this season for the first time since 1995 - 96 , @entity0 knows they need to finish in the top four to preserve their status as one of the continent 's elite clubs			1
@entity0 has vowed to return @entity1 to the @entity2 next season the @entity6 star says he has adapted to everything about life in @entity22 - except the cold weather @entity1 sit fourth in the @entity10 table at present , good enough for a @entity2 spot ' yes , i do miss @entity2 football , ' he said in an interview with @entity30			1
' we will have to do our best this season so that we qualify for next year 's tournament			2
' it wo n't be easy			2
but some weeks ago we were seventh or eighth in the table , and now we are fourth			0
so we have to keep on working			0
' the thing we aim for the most is qualifying for the @entity2 , which is what this club deserves			2
i also want to win titles , but i am aware that we will have to go step - by - step since the manager and some of the players are new			0

the 26 - year - old has scored three times in the @entity10 and laid on six assists for others			2
that is undoubtedly @entity0 's main strength - he has contributed 20 league assists in 2014 , more than any other player in @entity4 's top five leagues			1

' @entity0 was given the nickname ' @entity98 ' - which translates as ' noodle ' - by his former @entity7 team - mate @entity100 but despite his wiry frame , he is not fazed by the physical nature of @entity104 football			1
' it 's true , the defenders are big and strong here , ' he said			0
' but i never have any fear			0
if they have to hit me , then so be it			0
that 's part of the game			0
i will always try to play my way , no matter how big the defenders are			0
' on living in @entity22 , he added : ' it 's much colder here and it gets dark a lot earlier than in @entity120			0

my only problem is with the cold temperature			2
