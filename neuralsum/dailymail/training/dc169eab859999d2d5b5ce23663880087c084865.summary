much more of this and @entity1 will be asking @entity2 to send his team on long pre-season tours every summer			2
just a day after bemoaning the fact that his club 's busy schedule here in @entity10 was threatening to disrupt his players ’ preparations for the new season , the new @entity2 manager watched his team stroll through their opening tour game against a lamentable @entity17 at the @entity18 in @entity19			1
this is an iconic @entity10 stadium , which hosted the 1994 @entity22 final , and @entity2 produced a clinical performance with which to grace it			2
@entity2 second - half ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity41 ; @entity42 , @entity36 , @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity37 , @entity46 ; @entity47 ; @entity48 , @entity49			1
goals : @entity28 13 , @entity25 41 ( pen ) and 45 , @entity46 and 84 , @entity49 88 and 90			1
@entity17 : @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ; @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ; @entity42 , @entity61			0
booked : @entity42 , @entity55			0
referee : @entity63 @entity64 : @entity37 watching them sweep @entity17 aside , it was hard to believe that it is the @entity10 team are in the middle of their season and @entity2 who are supposed to be looking for form and fitness under their new manager			2
in fact the only problem the @entity78 side had all night was actually getting to the stadium			0
despite the presence of a police escort , @entity2 ’s team bus took more than two hours to reach @entity19 from their hotel in @entity86 , meaning that at one stage the kick - off was in danger of being put back			2
in the end , though , everything started on time and the night subsequently ran like clockwork for @entity2 who eased to victory through two first half goals from @entity25 , one from @entity28 , two goals for half - time substitute @entity98 followed by two late strikes from @entity49			1
flying start : @entity28 celebrates putting @entity2 in the lead after just 13 minutes jumping for joy : the @entity104 @entity22 forward celebrates in front of the @entity2 fans with the stadium almost full – there were more than 86,000 here - on a beautiful , warm @entity109 night , @entity2 perhaps felt compelled to put on a good show			1
whatever the case they began well and scored in just the 13th minute			0
@entity113 chose to use the 3 - 4 - 3 formation he deployed with @entity115 at the @entity22 and it will be interesting to see if he keeps faith in it			1
more noticeable in the first half , though , was the performance in the centre of midfield by new signing @entity37			0
the @entity123 was impressive from the start , passing the ball well and helping @entity2 to set the rhythm they needed and so often lacked under @entity128 last season			0
wing wizard : @entity131 - playing in a right wing back role - crosses for @entity2 spot on : @entity25 beats @entity52 from 12 yards out to double @entity2 's advantage midfield general : new signing @entity37 was outstanding all night for @entity2 you 'll have to do more than that to impress me ! @entity113 looks on sternly as @entity2 romp to victory @entity2 almost opened the scoring in the fourth minute as @entity37 forced @entity17 goalkeeper @entity52 to touch his shot over from 25 yards			1
soon after , though , they did break through as @entity39 bustled through the middle , the ball broke free and @entity28 swept a first time shot past @entity52 from the edge of the penalty area			2
it was a superb , crisp finish from the @entity104 player and typical of what @entity2 were to go on to produce			0
@entity17 did threaten briefly after the first @entity2 goal as @entity57 crossed low for @entity153 and @entity2 goalkeeper @entity154 had to save sharply			0
that was as good as it got for the @entity10 team , though , as @entity2 scored twice more before half - time			1
the second goal came from the penalty spot after @entity131 ’s run and cross down the right brought a handball from @entity163			0
@entity25 stepped up to convert the penalty with his right foot			0
thumbs up : @entity113 watches the game from the bench alongside his assistant @entity168 case for the defence : @entity34 was part of a back three deployed by @entity2 then , in first half added time , @entity25 profited from a terrible mistake from @entity17 defender @entity54 to lift the ball over the goalkeeper and in to the goal			1
with the game won , it was tempting to wonder if @entity2 would be able to come out and play with such intensity in the second half			2
@entity113 made sure there was no slacking off , though , by making nine half - time changes			1
only @entity37 and @entity36 remained , with the @entity183 dropping back to the centre of defence for the second period			0
starting role : @entity123 @entity39 impressed for @entity2 playing in behind the strikers close call : @entity47 bends a second - half effort just wide of the post midfield maestros : @entity36 and @entity37 started together in the middle of the park new kid on the block : @entity98 ( second right ) is congratulated after scoring his first doubling up : @entity46 scored two in a matter of minutes to stake his claim for a regular spot double salvo : @entity49 scored twice for @entity2 in the dying minutes of the match after the break , things actually got a little surreal			1
@entity49 left back @entity46 scored twice – from an @entity49 cross shortly after half - time and then again from 15 yards as he ran on to a loose ball with six minutes remaining – while @entity49 himself added two of his own in the last four minutes to complete @entity17 ’s humiliation			1
both of @entity49 ’s passes came from @entity37 passes and certainly the @entity123 ’s night was an influential one			0
at the end of the game , a pitch invader was flattened by a steward in the centre circle			0
it was the closest an @entity10 had come to make a perfect tackle all night			0
silverware : @entity36 smiles as he collects the @entity223 after the game all smiles : @entity226 will be hoping this is not @entity2 's only trophy this season @entity229 not good for @entity2 - @entity113			1

@entity113 wins first game as @entity2 manager
@entity234 played 3 - 4 - 3 formation for entire 90 minutes
@entity28 opened scoring for @entity2 after 13 minutes
@entity25 scored first - half double in first game after @entity22
@entity113 made nine half - time changes
@entity46 and @entity49 both scored twice in second - half
@entity2 win the @entity223
