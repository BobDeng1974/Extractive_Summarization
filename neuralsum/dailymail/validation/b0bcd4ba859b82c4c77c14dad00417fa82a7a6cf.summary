for @entity1 , there were no apologies , no guilt and no sense of remorse			2
he deemed the nine changes before their defeat at @entity8 necessary if @entity9 are to be ready for @entity10 in their @entity12 quarter - final replay on monday night			1
of those nine , four were making full debuts			0
discounting @entity14 , the rest of the @entity9 side had made just 34 championship starts between them this season			1
whatever @entity1 says , this was an unwrapped gift to a team chasing promotion to the @entity23			2
but the manager must be well down the list when blame is apportioned			0
@entity28 's @entity9 team - mates gather to congratulate the midfielder after his goal against @entity8 @entity1 played a decidedly under strength side at @entity32 that will completely change on monday @entity9 's @entity35 and @entity10 's @entity34 clash in the 0 - 0 draw that forced monday 's @entity12 replay at the @entity38 , with both sides nursing their squads in the lead - up to the fixture it is the fault of broadcasters that he had just 48 hours between leaving @entity32 on saturday and kicking off against @entity45 on monday evening			1
domestic cup fixtures can not be played on the same night as @entity48 games and , as such , there is no way around this ludicrous situation			2
@entity1 is expected to name a completely fresh xi at the @entity38 , while @entity53 , who made six changes of his own side for the 1 - 1 draw at @entity57 , will mix and match , too			1
@entity45 had five players who retained their place from the @entity12 game			2
fifteen changes was the sum total and for one reason only			0
@entity1 is dealing with a ludicrous 48 - hour turnaround between playing @entity8 and @entity45 these will be two teams going hell for leather in a competition they have prioritised			1
their tedious goalless draw at @entity74 last week may have been wretched to watch , but this tie is harking back to the @entity12 ’s old days , neither side giving an inch			1
they could not bear losing at this stage			0
@entity9 supporters wo n’t remember the 4 - 1 defeat at @entity8 in a decade ’s time , but a day out at @entity84 , taking on holders @entity85 , would stick in the memory should they progress			1
the @entity9 have nothing to play for in the league			2
they are safe and will not trouble the second tier ’s play - offs			2
@entity92 ( centre ) scored the opener against a @entity9 side with nothing to play for in the league and club captain @entity28 , who made only his second appearance for the club since september 2013 because of injury , backed his manager ’s decision to ring the changes			1
‘ the gaffer has to bear the replay in mind , ’ said @entity28 , who scored his side ’s consolation as @entity8 ran riot with strikes from @entity92 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			1
‘ if you put a team out that does n’t win at @entity8 you get criticised , but if you do n’t win on monday you get criticised as well so it ’s a @entity118 for the gaffer			1
‘ playing at @entity84 is one of those things that you just ca n’t describe			0
the feeling we had when we went there before ( the 2011 @entity126 play - off final loss to @entity125 ) will always stay with me			2
’ @entity9 's @entity128 passes under pressure as his side struggled against the promotion hopefuls @entity53 has had a trickier balancing act			1
@entity45 are three points beneath the @entity135 play - offs and will have two games in hand once tuesday ’s programme of fixtures is complete			1
he could n’t afford to make changes quite so wholesale for their trip to @entity142 , knowing promotion is by no means out of the question			0
those in @entity147 will think of two years ago when they were capable of juggling that fairytale journey to the @entity151 final and the league campaign , which ended in promotion from @entity154			0
@entity9 will doubtless have the fresher side tonight and @entity53 knows his team blew their best chance of reaching the semi-finals			1
but they feed off adrenaline			0
just ask @entity161 and @entity162			0
two games in three days will not faze this collection of loanees and cast - offs			0
after all , @entity85 await			0
performance of the weekend maybe , just maybe , @entity168 can inspire @entity169 to @entity171 survival			0
marooned at the foot of @entity154 for months , all looked lost			0
the 1 - 0 win at @entity175 - thanks to an @entity177 own goal - was their first three points on the road since october , their first clean sheet away from @entity183 for 12 months and puts them within two results of safety			1
no wonder defender @entity186 was close to tears in the dressing room afterwards			0
what 's caught my eye			0

@entity9 were *battered* 4 - 1 by @entity8 on saturday at @entity32
@entity1 's starting side will be entirely different on monday night
@entity9 have just 48 hours between leaving @entity8 and kicking off against @entity135 's @entity10 for a place in the @entity12 semi-finals
@entity198 was on the brink of being given the boot by @entity201 four weeks ago . *remarkably* the @entity202 then went on a four - match winning run away from home , *including* saturday ’s 2 - 1 win at *relegation* rivals @entity206 , to give themselves hope in the @entity126 .
it might finally be time for @entity210 to return to the championship . they *walloped* @entity213 5 - 1 at @entity214 **—** @entity215 *netting* four **—** to retain their two - point lead over @entity218 in the race for second in @entity135 .
@entity222 had the chance to become the first team in almost half a century to go *30* games without drawing . manager @entity227 said it was ‘ all or nothing ’ for his team . that was before they drew 0 - 0 at @entity233 .
