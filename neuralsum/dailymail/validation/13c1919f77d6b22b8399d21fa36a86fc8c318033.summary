@entity0 has endured a lot since swapping @entity2 for @entity3			1
derided as a symbol of the @entity7 regime , ridiculed by his own fans and , lately , held responsible for @entity10 ’s occasional lurch towards route - one football , the big @entity4 has had more weighing on his shoulders than that trademark mass of curly hair			1
so the standing ovation he received from the majority of @entity18 supporters when he came off against @entity19 at @entity20 last weekend will have been music to his ears			2
@entity0 fires @entity18 into the lead against @entity19 , a reminder of his footballing ability the @entity4 trains ahead of @entity18 's crucial clash with @entity28 on sunday , where he is sure to be involved @entity0 has grown from a bit - part player last season to become a vital member of @entity10 's squad a well - taken opening goal with his left foot served as a reminder that @entity0 ’s attributes are not just sandwiched between his chest and his head			1
there are those who will never accept that he is a true @entity18 player , who believe his very presence encourages @entity18 to play other than the @entity18 way			2
but as he prepares to make his first appearance on @entity2 since moving from @entity47 when @entity49 ’s side take on @entity28 on sunday , the 6ft 4in midfielder has every right to feel that things are looking up			1
the £ 27.5million white elephant of @entity20 has been reinvented as @entity18 ’s not - so - secret weapon			2
the advanced role that @entity49 has given to @entity0 led @entity55 , of all people , to label his opponents ‘ @entity58 ’ after the 27 - year - old ’s introduction off the bench helped salvage a 1 - 1 draw at @entity63 last month			1
@entity0 starred in the 3 - 0 win over @entity28 at @entity20 in december , and offers @entity49 an alternative @entity66 celebrates with the big @entity4 , who has scored five times for @entity18 this season @entity0 was tainted , somewhat unfairly , by being the only signing made during @entity7 ' summer in charge @entity49 does n’t care			1
‘ @entity0 is a player that , when we can not beat the pressure with quality , we can always beat with pressure — that is a quality , ’ says the @entity70			2
the transition from defensive midfielder , who first impressed @entity7 playing for @entity80 against @entity28 in the @entity81 in 2008 , to target man worked particularly well for @entity47			1
but , unlike @entity49 , @entity7 did not feel comfortable deploying @entity0 in a similar role at @entity20 , having drawn enough criticism merely for signing him when @entity85 was his priority in the summer of 2013			1
disastrously , @entity0 ended up as @entity18 ’s only signing and @entity7 knew that he risked being accused of turning the @entity89 champions into a poor imitation of @entity47			1
the player was said to be ecstatic at signing for @entity18 , if a little overawed at the scale of the club			2
he struck up an immediate bond with fellow @entity4 @entity95 and , later , @entity96 , when the @entity97 joined the following january			2
by then it had all started to go wrong , a combination of injuries and sub-standard performances in a more defensive position confirming the fears of many @entity18 supporters			0
last april , the now - defunct fanzine @entity106 mocked up an advert of his afro hair as a toilet brush with the slogan : ‘ flush a fortune down the pan ’			0
since the arrival of @entity49 , the midfielder has been used as an outlet and a way of breaking teams down the @entity4 was given a rousing applause when he was replaced after a good performance against @entity19 @entity0 was said to be devastated by it all , and even more so when @entity7 was sacked later that month			1
he felt isolated and has since claimed that he was made a scapegoat for the club ’s decline			0
one thing that never waned , however , was @entity0 ’s determination to salvage his dream			0
when he returned from the @entity127 last summer he held talks with @entity49 , who reassured him that he would not be sold despite talk of a move to @entity131			0
the message had not reached @entity18 fans , some of whom sarcastically applauded @entity0 ’s every touch in @entity49 ’s first home game against @entity138 right up until the moment he scored a last - minute winner			1
even then , it was assumed that his first goal for @entity18 would be his last			0
five more have followed this season			0
@entity0 came off the bench at half - time to turn the game at @entity148 in october and again at @entity149 in january			0
in between , he started in six successive wins before @entity151 , ending with a comprehensive 3 - 0 win over @entity28 when he destroyed his old @entity2 rivals			0
while @entity7 seemed loathe to play @entity0 off the striker , @entity49 has returned him to his best role @entity0 may suit slightly more ' long ball ' football , but has shown he can be mighty effective for @entity18 now @entity0 is set to face them again on sunday having won over at least some of his critics , much to the admiration of @entity162 , his former @entity47 team - mate and @entity18 ’s first - team coach under @entity7			1
‘ last season @entity0 was getting ridiculed and the way he has come back from that has been fantastic , ’ said @entity162			2
‘ he ’s won people over by being brave about the stick he was getting and never going missing in games , even when things were not working for him			0
‘ you also have to give @entity10 credit			0
he has not been afraid of playing to @entity0 ’s strengths despite being criticised for doing so			0
i think he has come up trumps			0

@entity0 endured a *torrid* season after joining @entity18
@entity7 failed to get the best out of the former @entity47 midfielder
but @entity10 has no qualms about using @entity4 in advanced role
@entity0 has become @entity49 's *battering* *ram* against tough opponents
