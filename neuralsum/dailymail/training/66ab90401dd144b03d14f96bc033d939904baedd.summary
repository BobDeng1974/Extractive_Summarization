families have been warned to arm themselves amid fears of more violent protests over the shooting of black teenager @entity4 in @entity5			1
@entity6 is bracing itself for renewed demonstrations ahead of a grand jury verdict on whether to charge a white police officer over the 18 - year - old 's death in @entity12			1
protesters are gathering in and around the city as they nervously await what many believe will be an inevitable no - indictment vote			2
the ruling was expected yesterday , but did not materialise			2
online chatter from users claiming to be police officers and their supporters predicts furious clashes regardless of the outcome , with some users saying the force will be powerless to protect the public			1
writing on the forum @entity44 , the user said : ' if you do not have a gun , get one and get one soon			1
we will not be able to protect you or your family			2
' it will be your responsibility to protect them			2
our gutless commanders and politicians have neutered us			1
' i 'm serious , get a gun , get more than one , and keep one with you at all times			0
' other posts label the protesters as ' terrorists ' , according to a report by @entity65			0
the forum has since been taken down			2
meanwhile , some users suggested asking the fire department for water hoses to protect the police from rioters			1
@entity6 governor @entity72 has declared a state of emergency and activated the @entity74 ahead of a grand jury decision on whether @entity76 ( left ) will be charged over the shooting of @entity4 ( right ) in his executive order on monday , @entity72 ( pictured ) cited the ' possibility of expanded unrest ' supporters of the policeman who shot @entity4 have launched a campaign to put up a billboard in the city backing the officer			1
the campaign was launched by a supporter from @entity89 last month and has already raised the $ 3,000 goal to erect the sign			0
plans are for the billboard to read ' @entity94 , do n't loot ' - a phrase made popular by @entity96 in response to the chant ' @entity99 , do n't shoot ' recited by @entity4 's supporters			1
the campaign website says it intends to erect the sign in the ' heart of @entity104 ' where many of the violent protests have taken place			0
although the $ 3,000 target has been reached , the billboard has not yet been purchased , it was noted by @entity110			0
according to the campaign website : ' the funds collected from this campaign will be used to purchase this billboard for as long as possible			0
' whatever funds we receive will go directly to keeping the billboard campaign up as long as possible			0
' if we come to an agreement with a company and can fund it for 3 months , 5 months , 7 months ... we will			0
' an anonymous user who claimed he was a police officer wrote : ' we ca n't even hit our sticks on the ground			1
' the emergence of the forum comes after two @entity127 accounts belonging to the @entity128 were taken over by hacker group @entity129 after the white supremacist group threatened protesters in @entity5			2
@entity129 acted after the group distributed flyers threatening ' lethal force ' against the protesters who have gathered around @entity12 while they await what many believe will be a no - indictment vote			0
@entity129 has previously announced that @entity76 will not be charged			0
@entity6 's governor has re-activated the @entity74 and declared a state of emergency in an effort to avoid more unrest			1
but when pressed further , he struggled to answer whether the buck stopped with him on any response to the protests			0
asked by reporters if it was his overall responsibility , he gave the less - than convincing response : ' we 're , um , you know , it a , you know , our goal here is to , is to , keep the peace and allow folks ' voices to be heard			0
' and in that balance , attempting , you know i am , using the resources we have to be predictable			0
... i do n't spend a tremendous amount of time personalizing this vis - a - vis me			2
' he was also vague when questioned on which official or agency was in command of the response , it was reported by @entity169			0
he said : ' well , i mean , it a , clearly , i mean , i , i feel good about the , we worked hard , to establish unified command , to allied responsibilities and now with the additional assets provided by my order today , with the @entity74 , you know , we have worked through a number of operational issues			1
' unlike in august , when governor @entity72 asked the troops to help quell the sometimes - violent protests that had occurred nightly following @entity4 's death , his latest move is pre-emptive , coming ahead of any decision on whether @entity5 officer @entity76 will be indicted			1
there also are some operational differences this time			0
when @entity72 last declared a state of emergency , he put the @entity189 in charge of a unified local police command and later activated the @entity74 to provide security around the command center			1
@entity72 said the @entity194 would be in charge of security in @entity5 after the grand jury decision and would work with the @entity189 and @entity12 city police as part of a unified command to ' protect civil rights and ensure public safety ' in other jurisdictions			1
' my hope and expectation is that peace will prevail , ' @entity72 said monday			1
' but we have a responsibility - i have a responsibility - to plan for any contingencies that might arise			0
' there is no specific date for a grand jury decision to be revealed and @entity72 gave no indication that an announcement is imminent			1
but @entity218 prosecutor @entity217 has said that he expects the grand jury to reach a decision in mid-to - late november			1
the @entity221 , which is conducting a separate investigation , has not said when its work will be completed			0
the governor did not indicate how many @entity74 troops would be mobilised , instead leaving it to the state adjutant general to determine			1
@entity72 said the @entity74 would be available to carry out any requests made through the @entity189 to ' protect life and property ' and support local authorities			1
if the guard is able to provide security at police and fire stations , then more police officers may be freed up to patrol the community , @entity72 said			1
preparation : demonstrators lay on the ground in a mock death protest of the shooting of @entity4			2
the area around @entity12 , @entity6 , is preparing for the grand jury decision in the shooting death of @entity4 @entity12 mayor @entity246 said monday that he supports @entity72 's decision to activate the guard			1
he said the guard ' will be used in a secondary role ' and could potentially be stationed at places such as shopping centers and government buildings			0
' the way we view this , the guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on ( the ) front line interacting directly with demonstrators , ' @entity246 said			0
before the shooting , @entity76 spotted @entity4 and a friend walking in the middle of a street and told them to stop , but they did not			0
according to a @entity268 report based on sources the newspaper did not identify , @entity76 has told authorities he then realised @entity4 matched the description of a suspect in a theft minutes earlier at a convenience store			0
@entity76 backed up his police vehicle and some sort of confrontation occurred before @entity4 was fatally shot			2
he was unarmed and some witnesses have said he had his hands up when he was killed			0
@entity4 's shooting stirred long - simmering racial tensions in @entity5 , where two - thirds of the residents are black , but the police force is almost entirely white			1
rioting and looting a day after the shooting led police to respond to subsequent protests with a heavily armored presence that was widely criticized for continuing to escalate tensions			2
at times , protesters lobbed rocks and @entity296 cocktails at police , who fired tear gas , smoke canisters and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds .			2
