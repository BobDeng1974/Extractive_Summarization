the use of mobile phones and electronic devices during airplane takeoffs and landings have been banned by the @entity21 since 1991 following complaints from pilots they were interfering with navigation equipment			1
psychology professor at the @entity27 @entity26 and psychology professor at @entity30 @entity29 carried out a survey of 492 @entity33 adults who have flown in the past year to see how often passengers were breaching these regulations			1
forty per cent admitted that they did not turn their phones off completely during takeoff and landing on their most recent flight			1
more than 7 per cent left their phones completely on , with the @entity44 and cellular communications functions active , while a further 2 per cent actively used their phones when they were n't supposed to			1
according to the researchers , the odds that all 78 of the passengers who travel on an average - size @entity48 flight have properly turned off their phones are less than one in 100 quadrillion			1
they concluded : ' our survey strongly suggests that there are multiple gadget violators on almost every flight			0
rules : the @entity21 's current policy prohibits the use of personal electronics during takeoffs and landing ' if personal electronics are really as dangerous as the @entity21 rules suggest , navigation and communication would be disrupted every day on domestic flights			2
but we do n't see that			0
' the pair argue that the @entity21 policy on electronic device use should be ' based on evidence rather than on fear '			0
in an article for the @entity77 , they argue : ' there is no reason to doubt the anecdotes told by airline personnel about glitches that have occurred on flights when they also have discovered someone illicitly using a device			2
' but when thinking about these anecdotes , we do n't consider that glitches also occur in the absence of illicit gadget use			0
more important , we do n't consider how often gadgets have been in use when flights have been completed without a hitch			2
' @entity92 is a powerful motivator , and precaution is a natural response			0
regulators are loath to make policies less restrictive , out of a justifiable concern for passenger safety			0
' once a restriction is in place , though , removing it becomes a challenge because every day without a gadget - induced accident cements our belief that the status quo is right and justified			0

almost one in ten say they keep their mobiles *connected* to @entity44 while in the air
2 *%* of passengers admit to using their phones during flights
