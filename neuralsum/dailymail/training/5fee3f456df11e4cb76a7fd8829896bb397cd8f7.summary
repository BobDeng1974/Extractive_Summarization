child molester @entity1 , 55 , has been allowed to appeal his five year jail term after his lawyers found a legal loophole			1
@entity1 and his boyfriend preyed on teenage boys but in 2006 their trial collapsed and he was allowed to go on holiday - because he was ‘ stressed ’			1
he went on the run in @entity7 and in 2007 he received an indeterminate sentence for imprisonment for public protection ( @entity19 ) and was jailed in his absence at @entity21			1
but when a judge realised @entity1 ’s offences pre-dated the legislation which introduced the @entity19 , he changed his sentence to five years in jail			2
now @entity1 's lawyers argue that the second sentence was illegal because such a change must be made only by the @entity30 , and crucially , in the presence of the defendant			1
so because he was 1,000 miles away , reportedly in the @entity7 holiday resort of @entity34 , they say he should be allowed to appeal his jail term			1
@entity1 was found guilty of four indecent assaults against two teenage boys and the judge passed the indefinite sentence in absentia because he posed a serious risk to the public			1
he had spent two years fighting extradition before being returned to @entity44 to start his five year sentence in november 2011			0
@entity1 , of @entity46 , appeared at @entity47 on friday where the original trial judge sent the case to the @entity51			0
bolt hole : @entity1 was reportedly staying in the resort town of @entity34 on the @entity55 coast in south west @entity7 mr @entity57 , defending , said @entity1 will also argue that the two years he spent in a @entity7 prison while fighting extradition should count as part of his sentence			2
that would mean @entity1 would almost certainly be due for immediate release - after police spent hundreds of thousands of pounds and years bringing him to justice			0
the partner : @entity1 and boyfriend @entity67 ( pictured ) , 56 , preyed on teenage boys who were looking for a home after leaving council care mr @entity57 said : ' a sentence pronounced in court can only be changed by the @entity30 , and they should also consider if the time spent in custody in @entity7 should count towards his sentence			1
' this case needs to be listed for an urgent hearing at the @entity30			0
' @entity1 and boyfriend @entity67 , 56 , preyed on teenage boys who were looking for homes after leaving council care			1
they ran a lettings agency and used their position to bully the young tenants who were forced to strip off and take part in sex acts			0
but @entity1 went on the run in may 2006 after judge @entity86 allowed them leave the country mid trial			2
@entity1 and @entity67 were both traced to @entity7 and arrested in 2009 following an appeal by @entity92 ’s @entity91			0
in their absence @entity1 , of @entity21 , @entity93 , had been found guilty of four counts of indecent assault on a male person over a five year period and jailed for five years			0
@entity67 , of @entity100 in @entity101 , had been convicted of one charge of indecent assault on a male person and jailed for three years			0
@entity67 was brought back in early 2010 and sentenced to a further 36 months for jumping bail			0
mr @entity107 , prosecuting during the latest hearing , said the case had to go to the @entity30 because any correction of a sentence has to be made within 28 days and with the defendant present			2
judge @entity86 said he hopes the @entity30 confirms the five - year sentence			2
@entity1 also faces an additional sentence for jumping bail , but that case was adjourned indefinitely .			0
