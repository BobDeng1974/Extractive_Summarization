by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:30 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 18:05 est , 26 september 2013 outside court : @entity3 , 40 , insisted at @entity5 's @entity4 that her father 's siblings had ' never liked her and did n't want to know her ' as the only child of a wealthy diplomat ’s son , she was treated like a ‘ princess ’ by her father and believed he had promised to leave her his fortune			1
so @entity3 was shocked to learn after he died that his siblings had ‘ encouraged ’ him to sign a deathbed will they had drawn - up without legal advice which left the bulk of his estate to them			1
she launched a @entity4 battle to have the will declared invalid , accusing relatives of her father , @entity24 , of conspiring to cheat her out of £ 500,000 of her inheritance			1
but yesterday a judge threw out her claim , ruling that despite suspicions there was no proof that the will was unlawful			2
mrs @entity3 , 40 , alleged her father ’s siblings never liked her because she had ‘ shamed ’ their respectable family by being born out of wedlock			1
her grandfather , @entity35 , was a @entity36 diplomat who lived in @entity5 and married an @entity38 woman , setting up home in @entity40 and raising their four children			1
but his son @entity43 went through a hippy stage and was not married to mrs @entity3 ’s mother when she was born in 1972 , causing his family to resent her , she claimed			1
despite this , she said her father ‘ treated her like a princess ’ and promised on her wedding day that he would leave everything to her			0
but after he died of throat cancer aged 65 in 2011 , she learnt that the will he had signed days earlier left most of his £ 620,000 estate – including his home in @entity55 , @entity5 and flat in @entity56 – to his sisters @entity58 and @entity59 , his brother @entity60 and the children of a third sister , @entity62			1
property : when her father @entity24 succumbed to cancer in march 2011 , the home - made will was produced , leaving the bulk of his fortune - including @entity55 home ( pictured ) - to his sisters and brother involved : claiming that her father promised to leave her everything on her wedding day , mrs @entity3 accused his sisters @entity62 , and @entity58 ( pictured ) , who is in her 60s , of being ' part of a conspiracy ' mrs @entity3 , who had become financially dependent on her father after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis , was left only £ 100,000 , the @entity4 was told			1
she claimed the siblings exerted ‘ undue influence ’ on their dying brother to get him to sign the will			1
‘ i am the only child of my father , ’ mrs @entity3 said			2
‘ we had a close father - daughter relationship			2
' he knew of my medical condition and we discussed financial matters before his death			0
my father thought he was leaving his estate to me			2
’ evidence : miss @entity3 told @entity5 's @entity4 ( pictured ) that her father and mother - whom he met in his ' hippy ' days - were not married when she was born and felt her existence ' brought shame on the family ' picturesque : also included in the fortune was a flat in the luxury holiday resort of @entity56 in south - east @entity36 she added : ‘ the siblings took advantage of my father ’s admission to hospital by making and arranging the will			1
a lawyer does not have to be present when a will is drawn up or altered for it to be legal			0
only a few things are required to make a will – or an amendment to it – legal			0
it must be made voluntarily in writing by someone of sound mind who is over 18			0
and it has to be signed in the presence of two adult witnesses , who must themselves also both sign the will in the presence of the person making it			0
the witnesses can not be beneficiaries of the will			0
a will can be changed by making an official alteration called a codicil , which must be signed and witnessed in the same way as when it is drawn up , or by making a fresh will			0
the will should name the beneficiaries and say what should happen if they die before the person making the will			0
the will should also name the executor			0
although lawyers are not a legal requirement , the government advises getting legal advice unless the will is simple			0
‘ if he did sign the will , he was compelled to sign any document put before him , without ever knowing the full and real contents of it or its implications			0
the circumstances around the making of the will raise suspicion			0
’ mrs @entity3 , from @entity160 , claimed that after her father ’s death his siblings refused to accept that she was his child and she had to undergo dna testing and obtain a court order to prove her paternity			1
but @entity168 , for the siblings , fiercely denied this claim and said the way mr @entity24 ’s assets were divided was ‘ perfectly understandable ’			2
he said the £ 100,000 left to @entity180 ‘ reflected his favourable treatment of his daughter during his life ’ and the fact that he was ‘ getting tired ’ of giving her money			1
judge @entity181 ruled that despite the ‘ colossal distrust ’ that blighted the family , mrs @entity3 ’s father had not been subjected to any ‘ undue influence ’ and knew what he was doing when he signed the will			1
he recognised that suspicions were raised by the absence of legal advice and the fact that the will was ‘ encouraged and drawn up by members of the family who stand to benefit under it ’			0
but dismissing mrs @entity3 ’s challenge , the judge said her accusations of dishonesty were not backed up by evidence that the will had been executed wrongly according to law .			2

@entity3 , 40 , of @entity160 , insisted father 's siblings ' never liked her '
' @entity207 ' father and mother not married when @entity180 was born in 1972
insists half - @entity36 father was *pressured* into signing a death - bed will
it left her just £ 100,000 from @entity24 's £ *630,000* estate
but judge rules her father was not subjected to any ' undue influence '
