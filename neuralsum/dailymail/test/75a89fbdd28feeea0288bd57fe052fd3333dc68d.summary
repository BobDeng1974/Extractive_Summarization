@entity0 did it with the shot heard round the world			2
@entity4 did it with his one and only appearance at the @entity8			2
@entity9 achieved it at the @entity11			1
when it comes to the career @entity14 the stars align it seems , and it is completed with wondrous deeds on fitting stages			0
and now @entity18 has the chance to join the exalted company of just five men at @entity22 , of all places			1
as @entity9 put it : ' where better could you ask for than to complete it here ? ' @entity18 tees off on the first during his practice round ahead of the 2015 masters on thursday @entity18 is targeting his third major title and the completion of his career @entity14 at @entity22 @entity18 ( left ) chats with @entity9 , who is ranked 111th in the world at present , at the course on wednesday and so , 155 years after the first major championship , another season opens with a potentially epochal event			1
a campaign that will take us to uncharted territory near @entity42 for the @entity43 and @entity44 for @entity8 ; to the whispering wilds of @entity46 for the @entity47			0
but it is here , where more majors have been held than any other venue , where we begin with the most exciting storylines of all			0
this 79th masters was set up beautifully as it was , with @entity18 's bid to win a third straight major , but @entity9 's return has elevated it to another plane			1
love him or not , there 's no denying the frisson of added excitement he brings			0
noticeably thinner and brimming with health , how good to see him walking around with a smile on his face as well and signing autographs , clearly thrilled to be showing his kids the place where he has left an indelible mark			0
is this @entity72 - like conversion a sign he does n't think he can win any more , or is he just a man whose heart has grown fonder through absence ? whatever the answer , it will make for compelling viewing over the next few days as the man who won 11 of his 14 majors ranked no 1 in the world tries to win one ranked 111th			1
and here 's a nice little omen to send him on his way : @entity87 was ranked 111th when he won @entity8 at @entity88 's in 2011			1
@entity89 signs autographs for a host of young fans following his practice round on wednesday in the press room on tuesday it was as if @entity18 and @entity9 had switched personalities , with the former the subdued , somewhat reluctant one			1
to be fair to @entity18 , he 's been answering the same questions for eight long months			1
he 's talked out about the @entity14			0
now he gets the chance to enter the blessed sanctuary that inside the ropes provides and finally seize his opportunity to set a new benchmark for @entity104 golf rather than talk about it			0
for two of his four major championship victories , @entity18 got a huge helping hand from @entity109 , as great dollops of rain rendered @entity111 for the @entity113 and @entity114 for last year 's @entity116 soft and defenceless — the sort of dart - throwing contest which is right up @entity18 's alley			1
this masters might get interrupted as well by an afternoon thunderstorm or two but it is also expected to get under way on thursday with near record temperatures for this time of year			1
add that to @entity22 's sub-air system under the greens and there will be no darts thrown here			2
if you 're going to join legends , you should be doing it the hard way			0
a flock of fans capture a @entity9 shot on their smartphones as the @entity138 star went through his paces @entity18 might be the bookies ' favourite for good reason but his @entity22 record offers up a litany of damning statistics he must rectify before he can be considered for a green jacket			1
can you believe that as good a driver as the @entity148 is , he has hit the par five 13th fairway just four times in 22 attempts in competition ? or that he has had no birdies in 44 tries on the holes that start the front and back nines			2
this week we will truly get the chance to gauge his development as a golfer			0
alongside him for the first two days will be @entity162 , another player who had all the attributes to win @entity22 at 25 but had to wait until the age of 33 to win his first masters			1
it might be that @entity18 has to wait a while longer , too			2
there are not only questions about his own record at @entity22 that the world no 1 must answer			1
there 's the formidable form of his peers			0
the next six players in the rankings — @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 — have all either won a tournament in the past two months or have a green jacket already			0
it is inconceivable at least one wo n't hit form			0
@entity162 will play alongside @entity18 for the first two days of the tournament in @entity22 the list of potential winners stretches longer			1
indeed , there 's not a great golf - playing territory in the world that wo n't be watching with legitimate hopes of seeing one of its own triumph			2
nowhere will that anticipation be greater than here			0
a win for @entity18 and papers will be filled with where it ranks in the annals of the great feats achieved by @entity207 sportsmen			2
there 's no point discussing what might be the ending when the drama has not even begun			0
but it 's perfectly acceptable to keep fingers crossed and dare to wonder whether , over the next four days , we 're going to be witnesses to a singular piece of @entity207 sporting history .			0
