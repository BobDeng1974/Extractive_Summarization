by @entity0 for humans in dark places , using touch and feel can help us ‘ see ’ where we ’re going			1
but for the @entity8 blind cavefish , using touch alone is n’t enough			1
instead , in the absence of eyes , they ’ve evolved an ability to alter the water around them , creating a force field of sorts that alerts them to the presence of obstacles			1
suddenly @entity21 sea : the @entity8 blind cavefish sucks in water at different rates to find out what is in its vicinity the research was performed by a team at @entity29 , @entity26 led by dr. @entity30			1
when observing the blind cavefish ( @entity32 ) in a tank , they noticed it was continuously opening and closing its mouth every few seconds			1
this fish is found in @entity37 and central and eastern @entity8			1
it is a freshwater fish that grows to a maximum of 4.7 inches ( 12 centimetres )			2
it spends most of its time at the bottom of creeks and rivers			0
its diet is mostly crustaceans and insects			0
the loss of its eyes through evolution may have allowed the fish to focus more energy on growth and reproduction			2
the water comes in and is then discharged through their gills			0
the sucking action , however , had not been noticed before , so @entity30 and his team set about understanding why it did this			0
they found that when they rearranged the objects in the tank , the fish moved much more slowly and sucked more often as it attempted to regain its bearings			0
at 2.8 inches ( seven centimetres ) from a large object , the fish sucked twice as fast			0
when 0.8 inches ( two centimetres ) away , it sucked six times as fast			0
‘ we hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generate a hydrodynamic velocity field , ’ the researchers write in their paper			1
once water is sucked in it is then pushed back out through the gills , forming a noticeable pressure wave around the fish			2
@entity80 : this fish might remind you of the popular video game character @entity85 , who used his sucking ability to destroy obstacles and enemies in his path the researchers suggest that creating this wave makes the movements of the fish 60 times more accurate than without it			1
this allows it to be incredibly nimble and agile despite not having eyes			0
but no one is quite sure why the fish has developed this ability			2
some theories suggest it is a ' regressive trait ' that has occurred over time			0
but others think it may simply be part of the evolution process , with the fish losing its eyes as it had no need for them			0
whatever the reason , the use of water currents as a tool to ' see ' makes this one of the most unique fish in the world .			1

@entity8 blind cavefish has evolved an *unusual* ability to detect obstacles
study at the @entity29 observed the odd *behaviour* of the fish
sucks water through its mouth to create currents that *reveal* things *nearby*
when in *unfamiliar* *territory* it sucks with *higher* *intensity* to ‘ see ’ more
it is the only fish known to use this form of *navigation*
