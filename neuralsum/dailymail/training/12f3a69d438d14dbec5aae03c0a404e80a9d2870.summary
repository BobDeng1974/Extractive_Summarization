@entity0 and a-level examinations could be brought forward for hundreds of thousands of pupils to avoid a clash with @entity4 under controversial proposals			2
teachers and lecturers in @entity8 and @entity9 are pushing for the summer exam timetable to be altered to help @entity12 students who will be fasting when they sit papers			1
school exam boards and universities are considering the radical shake - up from 2016 , when the religious period of @entity4 clashes with the exam season			0
fast : a girl reads from the @entity21 on the last friday of the @entity23 holy month of @entity4 ( file photo )			0
@entity12 across the world abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset during the period one option is to hold some exams earlier within the usual may - june exam season			1
another is for fasting @entity12 students to be eligible for extra marks under ‘ special consideration ’ rules if they believe their performance has been affected			1
the holy period in the @entity23 calendar , which requires @entity12 to fast during daylight hours , starts to fall earlier and earlier in the summer from next year , progressively clashing with the exam season in june			1
the clash also coincides with @entity43 ’s return to o - level style exams , which are taken at the end of the two - year course rather than at intervals throughout it – making the summer exams the only chance to do well			0
this month , the @entity52 ( @entity53 ) conference will debate how to ‘ minimise the impact ’ on @entity12 pupils			1
@entity56 , who is on the @entity53 executive committee , said : ‘ the consequences are quite huge , particularly with the return to three - hour exams at the end of the course in the summer			1
if some of the big vital exams like @entity8 and maths could be rescheduled for before @entity4 kicks in , that would certainly be supported by the majority of teachers			0
’ @entity68 , the exam watchdog , and the @entity70 , which represents the main three exam boards , have met with @entity12 groups to discuss the issue			1
changes : suggestions including holding exams in the mornings making it easier for pupils to concentrate another suggestion is to run exams in the morning , when pupils are less likely to be hungry and tired , rather than the afternoon			1
the government - funded @entity83 , which advises higher education , said exam time - tables should be overhauled			0
‘ institutions should be prepared to consider significant adjustments to their exam schedules and think creatively about assessment methods in order to eliminate disadvantage to particular groups , ’ it said			2
@entity12 undergraduates at university are also affected by the clash of dates			2
at the @entity98 in @entity99 , they have already been told : ‘ where a student feels that fasting has affected their performance , this should be submitted as an extenuating circumstance			0
’ but @entity105 , a former head teacher and spokesman for the @entity107 , said children had been coping with exams for decades in many different circumstances			0
‘ where there is scope for some flexibility the exam boards should exercise it , but i do n’t think it is realistic for a board to rearrange their timetable to fit in with a minority religion , or any religion for that matter , ’ he said			0
‘ if you run exams in the morning because of this , you may be disadvantaging a @entity126 pupil who then has two exams in one day rather than one			2

efforts to ' minimise impact ' will be debated at @entity53 conference this month
