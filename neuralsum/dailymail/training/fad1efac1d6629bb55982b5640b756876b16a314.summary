by @entity0 published : 16:58 est , 9 february 2013 updated : 17:34 est , 9 february 2013 it is a dream for any golf fanatic : your own nine - hole course , laid out over almost 25 acres , with a clubhouse and apartment thrown in			1
now the dream could come true at @entity7 , near @entity8 in @entity9 , which is on the market			0
strangely , the couple who bought the complex 12 years ago were not golf nuts			1
@entity14 , 56 , played only when the sun came out and his wife @entity16 , 52 , had only ever tried pitch and putt			1
done to a tee : the @entity7 clubhouse with the two flats above is going on sale for £ 975,000 they bought the club as another adventure in their property - owning career			1
at the time , the couple owned four houses and four flats , which they managed as rentals but were looking for something less stressful			0
running a small country golf club , they felt , would suit them to a tee – despite their complete lack of experience			0
@entity16 recalls : ‘ @entity14 said to me , “ we could afford to buy that ”			1
we ’d been wondering what to do next and it sounded a good idea			0
’ in 2001 , the couple bought the club for £ 195,000 and started learning all about golf course management			1
they quickly found that keeping the course in pristine condition was tougher than it looked			0
@entity14 , used to trimming a suburban lawn , found himself mowing the greens almost daily and the rest of the course weekly during the spring and summer			1
loving and leaving : @entity14 and @entity16 , right , with son @entity56 , left , are ready to hand over their precious golf club to the next enthusiast ‘ it was much more like hard work than i was expecting , ’ he says			1
with just a mobile home on site , the family continued living in their @entity63 bungalow in @entity64 , and the long working days – starting at 7am and lasting until nightfall , seven days a week – soon took their toll			0
once planning permission was granted for a proper clubhouse with a three - bedroom apartment above , they decided to sell up in @entity64 and move on to the course			2
in january 2003 , they started building their new home			0
it took four months to complete the @entity80 - style property , rendered in white and surrounded by a veranda			2
the mansard windows on the first floor offer marvellous views across the course and farmland beyond			0
in 2006 , they extended , adding a double garage and self - contained one - bedroom flat for their son @entity56 , 32 , who helps run the business			2
the work cost about £ 200,000 , and today the property measures 3,862 sq ft. the couple ’s other son , @entity96 , 29 , who is in the building industry , also lives with them			2
although they love their home , @entity14 and @entity16 have long harboured an ambition to renovate a farmhouse in @entity104 and they have decided to sell the course for £ 975,000 so they can head off on another adventure			1
the golf club was first put on the market last may at £ 1.45 million – but the couple realised this was unrealistic in such a stagnant property market			1
the annual turnover is about £ 100,000 and running costs , excluding staff , are about £ 38,000			2
a new owner could either continue running the complex as a business or opt to keep it to themselves to work on their handicap in privacy			0
