@entity19 and @entity20 claimed they acted in self defence when mr @entity0 became enraged at their behaviour towards his girlfriend , @entity25			2
but , following a trial , @entity20 , who delivered the fatal knife wound , was found guilty of murder and @entity30 and an accomplice , @entity31 , also 18 , were convicted of manslaughter			1
@entity20 will spend at least 16 years behind bars			1
@entity19 was sentenced to eight years in a young offenders ' institution with an extended licence period of four years , and @entity31 was handed five - and - a - half years for his lesser role			1
the court heard how the victim had been drinking and became very angry when his girlfriend @entity25 told him the youths swore , spat and threw a drink at her earlier that day			1
when mr @entity0 confronted them , @entity19 and @entity20 shut themselves into a bin chute on a first - floor communal balcony			1
as the furious 46 - year - old hammered with his fists on the glass partition , another member of their gang found an axe in a shed and @entity31 passed it up to @entity30 , who had managed to get onto the roof of the adjoining porch			1
@entity31 told the court he only handed over the weapon to help his friends barricade themselves into the balcony - not to attack mr @entity0			1
but when mr @entity0 smashed the reinforced glass and began to crawl through the gap , @entity19 hit him twice on the head and once on the shoulder with the axe and @entity20 stabbed him repeatedly in the back with a knife			1
@entity20 said he delivered the fatal stab to the chest after mr @entity0 grabbed the axe from @entity19 , who then ran off			2
he told jurors that mr @entity0 had the axe in one hand and him in the other and he did not know what else to do			2
the victim emerged from the bin chute covered in blood , staggering , holding the axe before he collapsed and died from a stab to the heart			1

judge @entity98 told @entity20 : ' i accept @entity0 's behaviour was outlandish but he was provoked by you and others			0
i accept that his behaviour and that of @entity25 was inflammatory , drunken and pathetic			0
' but he added : ' this was a wicked and unnecessary crime - a ranting , inebriate being no match for a knife and axe being wielded by young and fit teenagers			2
' ' the carrying of knives has become endemic among some teenagers in parts of @entity117 and it is assumed to aid power and respect to the carrier			0
it is the resort of a coward			0
@entity31 , who handed the axe to the killers , was given a sentence of five - and - a - half years ' you are a dangerous young man , aggressive when carrying a knife and lacked the courage to tell anything like the truth about this			1
' the judge went on to sentence @entity30 to eight years in a young offenders ' institution with an extended licence period of a further four years , and @entity31 to five - and - a - half years for his lesser role			2
the court heard @entity19 flew to @entity140 , via @entity141 , after the incident but came back about three weeks later and was arrested on the plane at @entity144			0

before the murder , all the defendants apart from @entity20 had been involved in an incident earlier that evening at @entity154 pub nearby			2
they were asked to leave and while they were standing outside , a landlord said one of them threatened to ' shank or jook ' him - street slang for stabbing			2
in the years leading up to the murder , residents of @entity164 had complained about anti-social behaviour from groups of youths hanging around even though they did not live there			2

@entity19 , of @entity172 , @entity20 and @entity31 both of @entity6 and the 17 - year - old had all denied murder			1

mitigating for @entity20 , @entity178 said : ' he chose fight over flight and in seconds he made the wrong decision			0
' mr @entity0 's sister @entity182 said in a victim impact statement that the father of one was ' much loved ' by the family			0
she described how he was ' being bullied and victimised and he was doing his best and it got on top of him '			0
cctv from the night shows the gang fleeing the block of flats after the attack which killed mr @entity0 the @entity194 heard that two of the killers fled @entity7 after the attack , but they were later arrested he eventually ' succumbed ' to bullying because , she said , ' he was not prepared to put up with it and lost his life as a result '			1
investigating officer detective inspector @entity202 said : ' mr @entity0 was undoubtedly angry that day and rushed to confront the youths who had verbally abused his partner			0
' two took refuge behind a door but it took some time for mr @entity0 to reach them and they could easily have made their escape across the open roof area behind them			0
' instead they were handed at least one potentially lethal weapon by their friend on the ground and barricaded a door , waiting until mr @entity0 burst through			0
@entity189 shows them apparently calm and preparing for the attack			0
