by @entity0 disease - causing bacteria can linger on surfaces in commercial airplane cabins for up to a week , researchers have found			2
they say the seat - back pockets and armrests are particular hotspots for germs			1
the team found e-coli and @entity13 bugs can survive for several days			1
in the study researchers simulated the temperature and humidity levels typically found during commercial flight			0
@entity13 survived the longest -168 hours - on material from the seat - back pocket , while @entity37 : @entity38 lived for 96 hours on the material from the armrest			1
@entity41 , a graduate student in @entity43 's @entity42 , conducted a two - year study - funded through the @entity46 â€™s @entity45 - to determine how long @entity37 : @entity38 and methicillin - resistant @entity47 , or @entity13 , would survive on commonly touched surfaces under typical airplane conditions			2
a major airline carrier supplied researchers with material from armrests , plastic tray tables , seat - pocket cloth , window shades and metal toilet buttons			2
' our data show that both of these bacteria can survive for days on these surfaces , particularly the porous material such as armrests and seat - pockets , ' said @entity41			1
' @entity67 travelers should be aware of the risk of catching or spreading a disease to other passengers and practice good personal hygiene			0
' in order for bacteria to be transmitted from a cabin surface to a person , it must survive the environmental conditions in the airplane			0

' the point of this study is not to be alarmist , but to point out to the airlines the importance of providing a sanitary environment for travelers , ' said professor @entity95 , director of the study and mentor for @entity41			0
beware of the bugs : researchers say seat - back pockets and armrests are particular hotspots for germs			1
they team found e-coli and @entity13 bugs can survive for several days in aircraft cabins			1
' we want to work with them to minimize the risks to human health			0
' the @entity43 team is currently investigating how long pathogens that cause other diseases such as tuberculosis survive in an airplane environment			2
@entity41 said future steps include exploring effective disinfecting procedures and testing other surfaces and materials that have antimicrobial properties to determine if they can help reduce health risks .			0
