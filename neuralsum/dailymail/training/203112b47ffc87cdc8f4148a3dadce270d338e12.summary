a team of older men have celebrated completing a pioneering 35 - year health study - beating killer diseases by making simple changes to their lifestyle			1
health experts told volunteers to follow five simple rules - eat well , work out , drink less , keep their weight down and never smoke			1
they were told if they followed the healthy - living plan they would avoid heart disease , cancer , diabetes and dementia			1
live long and prosper : a team of older men have celebrated completing a pioneering 35 - year health study - beating killer diseases by making simple changes to their lifestyle @entity19 , 80 , who still cycles frequently			1
right , the retired teacher when he first started the study more than 2,500 men agreed to be monitored for the rest of their lives - but only 25 managed to stick to the rules they were given in 1979			1
the ' survivors ' are now in their eighties and nineties and yesterday celebrated their long lives at a party held by the research team			0
the study in @entity35 is the longest of its kind to examine the influence of environmental factors in chronic disease			1
from 1979 to the present day , researchers from @entity42 followed the lifestyle habits of men aged 45 - 59 living in the @entity46 area			1
they found that those who followed four or five of the specified healthy steps were 60 per cent less likely to develop dementia			1
@entity49 , 91 , stayed the course for 35 years			2

he was among 2,500 volunteers who took part in the study there was a similar reduction in the risk of heart attacks and strokes , along with 40 per cent fewer cancers			1
there was also a 70 per cent cut in the risk of diabetes , according to evidence presented yesterday at a @entity71 run by the university			2
retired teacher @entity19 and former warehouse cashier @entity73 are both in rude good health after following the healthy guide lines laid down to them by the @entity42 scientists			1

he said : ' i 'll go on as long as i am able to			0
i 've been refereeing for nearly 30 years now and still get a thrill out of it			0

i 've been refereeing for nearly 30 years now and still get a thrill out of it ' mr @entity73 said he was happy to co-operate with researchers throughout the life of the project saying : ' as far as i 'm concerned it 's been a great success			2
' it has been invaluable for me and i 'm pleased to have been part of it			0
' i 've stuck pretty well to the healthy lifestyle laid down and met with the researchers half a dozen times over the years			2
' it has been invaluable for me and i 'm pleased to have been part of it			0
' the volunteers gave researchers regular reports of their physical activity , alcohol consumption , and diet			1
their wives and families helped by completing a food frequency questionnaire			0
the recommended physical activity was to walk two or more miles to work each day , cycle 10 or more miles to work each day , or regular ' vigorous ' exercise			1

the @entity46 participants come from a community where consumption of fruit and vegetables was low @entity170 - fingered : @entity171 is still a keen gardener at the ripe old age of 85 mr @entity171 pictured abseiling in his younger days			2
the @entity46 research was a pilot for the much larger @entity176 study involving more than 500,000 @entity127 study leader @entity177 , age 84 every five years the men were re-questioned and re-examined along with their medical records to identify new cases of diabetes , heart disease and strokes			1
professor @entity177 , who has led the @entity186 study since its inception , said the findings were a ' wake - up ' call			2
' thirty years ago , only 30 men in our study followed all five of our recommended healthy steps , ' he said			1
' although following these steps does not give them complete protection against disease , the men who , despite living healthily , developed a disease did so at a much older age than the men neglectful of their lifestyle			1
' thus the development of heart disease was delayed by up to six years and it was up to around an additional 12 years before dementia took its grip			1
' on the less rosy end of the spectrum , 40 men in every 100 lived a life so neglectful that by any definition their lifestyle was unhealthy			0
they experienced none of the reductions in disease			0
' professor @entity177 added : ' the appalling fact is that recent surveys across the whole of @entity118 yield almost identical proportions of men and women following the healthy and unhealthy lifestyles found in @entity46 35 years ago			1
' and the picture is n't much better in @entity226 : 53 per cent of men drink more than the recommended amount and only half of men meet the government - recommended scores for well - being			2
' the advice given by the project has become familiar from other research showing that staying slim , eating lots of fruit and vegetables , exercising regularly , drinking in moderation and never smoking boosts longevity			0
the @entity46 participants come from a community where consumption of fruit and vegetables was low , so three or more portions a day was accepted as ' healthy '			2
fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories was classed as a good diet			0
those regarded as physically active were walking two or more miles or cycling ten or more to work each day , or taking ' vigorous ' exercise regularly			0
low alcohol consumption was defined as three or fewer units per day , with abstinence not treated as healthy behaviour			1
@entity255 , of the @entity256 which part - funded the project , said : ' these studies are expensive and complicated but essential to understand how dementia can be prevented			1
' the @entity46 research was a pilot for the much larger @entity176 study involving more than 500,000 @entity127			0
this is led by professor @entity264 , who also works at @entity42 .			0

the men in their 80s and *90s* completed a pioneering 35 - year health study
they *undertook* regular exercise , did not smoke and ate well
low alcohol intake and healthy *bodyweight* are key to being disease - free
the project of 2,500 men in @entity35 is longest of its kind
it found those following steps were 60 *%* less likely to develop dementia
there was a similar reduction in the risk of heart attacks and strokes
