the deputy prime minister shares the use of @entity2 with foreign secretary @entity3 as a perk of his @entity6 position @entity9 's plan to introduce a mansion tax on expensive properties would mean a charge of £ 150,000 a year on his country retreat @entity2 , it was revealed last night			1
the deputy prime minister is entitled to use @entity2 , which has 115 rooms and is set in 3,500 acres of @entity17 countryside , as a perk of his @entity6 position			1
under the @entity22 ’ policy , which will be reaffirmed at the party ’s spring conference next weekend , the owners of properties worth more than £ 2 million would have to pay an annual tax equivalent to one per cent of the value , an idea the @entity28 have condemned as a ‘ tax on aspiration ’			1
@entity2 , built in 1615 , has an estimated market value of £ 15 million and @entity32 sources have confirmed that other grace - and - favour homes used by senior cabinet ministers , including the prime minister ’s country residence @entity36 and the chancellor ’s weekend retreat @entity39 , would also be hit by the charge			2
ministers could make special provision to exempt the homes from the charge , but would leave themselves open to accusations of hypocrisy			0
according to the @entity48 , council tax at @entity2 is the responsibility of the @entity50 , which has run the stately home since 1967 when it was left to the nation by @entity53			2
however , last night a spokesman for mr @entity9 said : ‘ council tax is currently paid at @entity2 but it is met by the government , rather than the trustees			0
' given the current arrangements , if a mansion tax was introduced , it is highly likely there would be no loss of revenue – as it would be paid by the government to the government , as is already the case for many other taxes			0
’ @entity2 , built in 1615 , has an estimated market value of £ 15 million			0

the deputy prime minister is entitled to use @entity2 - worth £ *15m*
properties worth more than £ *2m* would be charged one per cent annual tax
