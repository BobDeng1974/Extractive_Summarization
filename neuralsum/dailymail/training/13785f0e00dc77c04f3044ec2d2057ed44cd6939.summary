by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:11 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 07:28 est , 20 september 2013 gamers have discovered that the status of one of @entity6 ’s missions turns to ‘ complete ’ only when your character has blown up a @entity10 doppelganger			1
in the mission you must infiltrate the headquarters of @entity13 , the game ’s @entity14 parody , plant a bomb inside a mobile phone and make sure the device finds its way into the hands of the ceo , @entity21			1
as @entity21 makes a landmark speech about @entity13 ’s latest invention – a mobile phone – you can call the phone and bring his career to an explosive and grisly end			1
warning : spoiler alert explosive ending : in @entity6 one mission sees a character blowing up a @entity10 lookalike the sign sits outside the headquarters of @entity37 's in - game parody of @entity14			1
during an early mission , players explore the offices of the social network site posters on the walls of @entity13 's offices			1
during one game scene , staff discuss how the site 's ceo ' stole the site ' from his co-founders - in reference to the claims made by the @entity53 brother 's against @entity14 's @entity10 reports claim that @entity6 has broken the record for the highest first - day sales of any video game , with world - wide sales of £ 500 million ( $ 800 million ) eclipsing the £ 310 million taken by @entity60 : @entity61 the game has certainly delivered the highest first day retail sales of any title sold by @entity65 , the parent company of the game 's developer @entity68			1
stores across the @entity70 opened their doors at midnight on tuesday for the special launch of the game , which reportedly cost around £ 170 million ( $ 275 million ) to make and market - more than films such as @entity76			2
the fact that online retailer @entity78 sold - out of the game on pre-orders alone was one clue that it would be a record - breaker			2
since the series began in 1997 , 135 million copies have been sold			2
in the gruesome scene @entity21 says : ‘ we are about to make the next step			0
prepare to witness the future : the @entity13 mobile device			1
we have invented something no one else has thought of			0
a small personal computerised device			0
now you ’re going to be able to dock twenty - four seven			0
’ moments later the device rings and blows up when @entity21 answers it , leading to mission success			0
@entity6 fans have found that the game is riddled with jokes about @entity14 and the privacy concerns that many have about it			1
@entity13 comes with the taglines : ' the reason the world never gets anything done any more ' and ' information is n't about imparting knowledge anymore			1
the @entity110 changed all that			0
' and exploring @entity13 ’s offices reveals a whiteboard with the statement : ' remember ! we are n't ripping them off if they do n't read the @entity118 ' , with word ‘ privacy ’ crossed out			1
what ’s more , gaming site @entity121 discovered that @entity68 has also launched a real - life version of @entity13 that lets players sign into using their @entity126 details			1
the @entity126 is @entity68 's community site			2
for people without a @entity126 login , clicking the @entity13 icon in the top right - hand corner loads a series of example , spoof brand pages for armament companies , broadcasters , a drink called @entity138 , cigarettes and a barbers			2
this @entity13 motto pokes fun at the privacy concerns raised by some @entity14 users			1
in the game , the site is given the tagline : ' the reason the world never gets anything done any more ' one account , for @entity153 and @entity154 said : ' whether you ’re a private security company , paramilitary force , rebel militia , hot housewife , radical insurgent , unhinged lottery winner , over-zealous neighborhood watch group , or just a military hobbyist with a worrying amount of disposable income , we ’ve got you covered			2
' our online store is officially launching			0
visit us anytime even from your @entity167 phone at @entity168 and shop for all your armored vehicle needs in the @entity172 area			2
' ' we know you appreciate being prepared , and so do we			0
an example @entity13 account for armament firm @entity175			1
as an extension of the in - game parody , @entity68 has also launched a real - life version of the site that lets players sign into using their @entity126 details ' so as a one - time special deal for all those who stalk our page here at @entity185 , we ’re happy to offer a 10 % discount for your first purchase of any armored vehicle at our online store when it launches this september			1
' stalk now and stay tuned to our page to see some of the inventory we ’ll have on offer			0
' stalking is the equivalent to @entity14 's like button and the @entity167 reference pokes fun at @entity199 's @entity198			1
there is also a @entity202 parody called @entity203 , in which users send bleets , and is described in - game as ' @entity203 is the perfect storm of blogging , social networking and text messaging			2
we 're demolishing 100,000 years of complex linguistic development 140 characters at a time			0
' the white boards in one of the @entity216 rooms , pictured , read : ' remember ! we are n't ripping them off if they do n't read the @entity219 ' with word privacy crossed out			0
there is also the line ' no privacy = @entity224 lies ' the blue and green @entity226 site , that mimics the colour - scheme of @entity202 , has the tagline : ' @entity229 ' with a sheep icon			0
it is also described in - game as : ' information is n't about imparting knowledge anymore			0
the @entity110 changed all that			0
' welcome to world of self aggrandizing shorthand			0
keep strangers and people you hated in high school up to speed with every mundane detail of your life 24/7			0
' welcome the the delusion of having an interesting life and friends			0
