foreign aid spending could outstrip the defence budget within 15 years , according to an analysis published last night			1
research conducted by the @entity4 found aid spending could eclipse defence by 2030/31 , assuming current spending changes continue under successive governments			2
according to the analysis , defence spending will be £ 27.1 billion by 2031 , but the aid budget will be £ 28.3 billion , the @entity9 reported			1
prime minister @entity13 , who has dismissed concerns about the impact of cuts on the capacity of the @entity19 forces in recent years , the @entity20 has seen its budget increase sharply as ministers try to hit the target of spending 0.7 per cent of gdp on aid			1
last week the @entity26 revealed that the @entity28 manifesto will not commit to keeping defence spending at the @entity31 target of 2 per cent of national income			1
yesterday @entity13 dismissed concerns raised by the head of the @entity35 about the impact of cuts on the capacity of @entity19 forces , insisting it remained a ' very strong and capable partner ' for the @entity41			1
in a sign of the pressure on the prime minister over the military budget , former defence secretary @entity42 said he and fellow @entity28 mps would find it ' hard to swallow ' if mr @entity13 allowed spending to fall below the 2 per cent @entity31 threshold while maintaining a pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of gdp on aid			1
former defence secretary @entity42 , pictured , has said he and fellow @entity28 mps would find it ' hard to swallow ' if defence spending fell below the @entity31 threshold ministers are under increasing pressure from @entity28 mps and senior military figures to commit @entity19 to meeting the @entity31 target after 2016			1
with deep cuts to @entity64 budgets to continue after may 's general election , chancellor @entity61 is reported to have warned privately that it may fall below that level			0
the most senior civil servant at the @entity69 said that the department would ' clearly ' like the @entity31 target to be met - although he said that it would be for ministers in the next government to decide			0
giving evidence to the @entity75 , @entity73 , the permanent secretary at the @entity69 , said : ' clearly , we would like 2 % of gdp but that 's for the next government to decide			2
' he said that on current forecasts , gdp growth was expected to outstrip the growth in the defence budget , so that it would drop below 2 % at some point in the next parliament			2
he warned that further cuts in spending could ultimately affect the capability levels of the armed forces			0
' it rather depends on how deep the cut is and how much further financial efficiency we can drive			0
if it were to be more than the level of financial efficiency we can drive , then yes , it will impact on capability , ' he said			0
speaking at a campaign event in @entity100 , the prime minister said the @entity19 's defence budget was the fifth largest in the world and second only to the @entity41 in the @entity31 alliance			1
he said : ' in terms of spending , the promise we have made is that the equipment budget , which is £ 160 billion over the next decade , that will grow by 1 % in real terms in each year of the next parliament			2
' also we have said we do n't want to see further reductions in our regular armed forces			0
so we have that commitment : second largest in @entity31 , fifth largest in the world			0
' and as for working with the @entity41 , i know because i spend time with president @entity115 and others , how much they appreciate the fact that @entity19 is a very strong and capable partner and able to fight with them , when it 's in our national interest , anywhere in the world			0
