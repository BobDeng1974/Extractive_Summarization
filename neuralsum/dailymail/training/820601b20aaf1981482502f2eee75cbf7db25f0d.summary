@entity0 produced a stunningly fresh performance that matched ambition with finishing skills at @entity4 on saturday evening with four tries running up a match - winning 31 - 10 lead inside 45 minutes			1
the brothers @entity9 and @entity10 marked their first test match together by opening the scoring for @entity0 , responding to a breakaway try by @entity15 flanker @entity14 in the second minute with two scores within minutes of each other			1
the locks were at the heart of a dominant display by the @entity0 pack which left the usually steamrollering @entity23 pack looking a pale shadow of themselves			0
@entity26 was bang on with his lineout throws , newcomer @entity28 was a skillful and consistent presence at the breakdown to cause problems for @entity15 in attack and @entity34 duo @entity35 and @entity36 combined well in the loose to maintain @entity0 ’s front - foot tempo			1
@entity38 scores his first try for his country en route to @entity0 's victory against @entity15 earlier , brother @entity43 had opened the scoring for the home side @entity10 is mobbed by his team - mates as they celebrate a second try for the home side new @entity0 coach @entity49 led his side to victory on his @entity4 debut @entity53 was named the man of the match after an influential performance @entity0 : @entity57 ; @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity53 ( c ) ; @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity35			1
subs : a @entity71 for @entity72 , @entity73 for @entity64 , @entity74 for @entity53 , both 64 , @entity75 65 , @entity76 for @entity63 , @entity77 for @entity66 , both 69 , @entity78 70 , @entity79 75 , @entity80 79			0
scorers : tries – @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity58 , @entity57 , @entity61 ; @entity82 – @entity53 ; cons – @entity53 4			0

another key figure in the @entity0 performance was scrum - half @entity53			2
the skipper looks a revitalised performer since his move to @entity117 in the summer and he created numerous chances with his speed of thought and movement across the new hybrid @entity4 turf			0
it was his break from a quick tap - penalty that set up the third try , the scrum - half delivering a fine pass off his left - hand to wing @entity129 for the winger to sprint in and when @entity53 repeated the trick minutes after half - time it was @entity57 who benefited and finished off in the right - hand corner			1
@entity0 were rampant at this stage , a team playing with great ambition and showing the skills so conspicuous in recent years only by their absence , and in truth they should have been further ahead by that stage but @entity53 missed a couple of penalties and @entity142 another , the younger @entity10 squandered a great chance with @entity59 by taking the wrong option and another penalty infringement cost the @entity146 another score			2
there was an inevitability about the way their pace dropped with @entity0 having virtually wrapped it up and @entity15 came back at them in the final half - hour			2
their pack got on the ball , managed to take play through the phases they had been dearly lacking in the first hour and @entity0 ’s defence was made to work harder to keep them at bay			0
this @entity0 managed for the most part until being reducedin number			0
the @entity15 attack was aided by yellow cards for @entity36 and @entity77 in the final quarter – the latter being sin - binned within minutes of coming off for a team penalty			0
a lone piper plays at the @entity170 ahead of @entity0 's clash with @entity15 @entity0 's @entity43 ( r ) , and brother @entity10 lined up together for the first time @entity15 's @entity173 ( r ) vies for the ball with @entity0 's @entity62 during the international @entity15 's flanker @entity14 scores the opening try of the game @entity15 teammates celebrate after taking an early lead through @entity97 at @entity4 @entity43 breaks through the @entity15 back row as @entity0 look for a response @entity43 ( @entity183 ) scores @entity0 's first try during the autumn international the @entity23 , eager to restore some pride , took advantage to score a penalty try and finish off with two scores from replacement scrum - half @entity190			1
@entity192 had by then snatched an interception and broken away to score and that ensured @entity0 ’s victory was never threatened , and left @entity196 a happy place for new coach @entity49 and the 36,000 - plus supporters			1
it was an entertaining game with plenty of tries to savour but the crucial statistic was that this was @entity0 ’s first win over @entity15 , a team that has overtaken @entity0 in the rankings in recent years , in five meetings at @entity4			1
a tide turning perhaps ? it is too early to say that , and it may be different when @entity211 pitch up next week after beating @entity212 , but for now @entity0 have uncovered a new buoyancy fuelled by the potential of a new - look squad and that has been a long time coming for the home faithful in this fixture			2
@entity10 crosses the line to score his first try wearing a @entity0 shirt @entity10 is helped off the ground by teammates after the brothers give @entity0 the lead @entity26 of @entity0 is tackled by the @entity15 back row as teammates rush in @entity129 dives to score @entity0 's third try to put them 19 - 10 ahead @entity57 bursts through to score @entity0 's fourth try wing @entity192 dives through to score @entity0 's final try of the game			1

@entity49 led @entity0 to victory over @entity15 on his @entity4 debut
second - row brothers @entity9 and @entity10 started an international game together for first time in the autumn test , with both scoring tries
@entity129 , @entity57 and @entity192 also scored to seal an *impressive* victory
