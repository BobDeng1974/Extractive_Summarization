ministers were warned they face a legal challenge over @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity4 last night as bitter recriminations flew about the ‘ shambolic ’ commons vote on the issue			1
eurosceptic @entity9 mps variously blamed @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 for the chaotic scenes that unfolded as a package of @entity17 crime and justice measures was approved			2
senior tories also turned their fire on commons speaker @entity21 , accusing him of siding with @entity23 to deliberately inflame the row			1
mps now plan to try to oust mr @entity21 next may and replace him with his popular @entity23 deputy , @entity25			2
instead , the government sought specific approval to rejoin the 11 measures not yet in @entity3 law , but made clear a vote against would mean the entire package , including the arrest warrant , not being implemented			1
in the event , the government won by 464 to 38 , a majority of 426			0
but former @entity44 treasurer @entity43 last night announced he is to seek a @entity46 injunction against @entity3 opting back into the warrant			1
mr @entity43 said his opposition to the warrant was being backed by @entity9 mp @entity50 to spearhead wider opposition to the warrant			1
he claimed rejoining the arrest warrant ‘ will largely make @entity54 , which has been a big source of liberty for the individual in this country for nearly 800 years , irrelevant ’			2
former cabinet minister @entity59 said mr @entity21 had gone ‘ over the top ’ in triggering the furore			0
but he acknowledged : ‘ i think it would have been better for all concerned if the @entity40 had simply put down an adjournment motion and debated the @entity65 arrest warrant in itself			2
’ ministers were ‘ technically correct ’ that a motion including the warrant would have been meaningless , since the measure is already on the statute book			0

he said his opposition to the warrant was being backed by @entity9 mp @entity50 but he added : ‘ i think the @entity75 was angry because the @entity75 wanted a specific debate on a specific issue			1
’ former home office minister @entity78 said it had ‘ not been a triumph of parliamentary handling ’ , but raised questions about mr @entity21 ’s conduct			0
‘ the danger is if he appears to be just against this executive – just against this government , ’ he said			0
@entity23 said it would give @entity86 another vote on the arrest warrant next week – the day before the by - election in @entity90 and @entity91			1
but the debate will be symbolic since the outcome of a vote will not be binding on the government			0
@entity96 said last night : ‘ we were very clear			0
‘ there was an opportunity for mps if they did not support the package of 35 measures , then the @entity3 would have come out of all of them			0
