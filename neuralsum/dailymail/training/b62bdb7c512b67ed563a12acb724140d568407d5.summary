@entity0 had never seen @entity1 in the flesh when he gambled on a one - year loan deal for the @entity5 winger			1
yet it took just one look at the stocky 24 - year - old to detect a @entity10 cult hero in the making			1
a potential crowd pleaser who can fulfil the @entity16 ’s craving for genuine pace and width in his team			1
cast into the starting line - up in pressing circumstances against @entity23 in the @entity24 , the @entity20 star marked his debut with a stunning 14th - minute goal			1
his general display raised hopes that @entity10 have made an astute capture			1
for 12 months , at least			1
possibly longer , depending on price			1
@entity1 scored on his @entity10 debut during the 2 - 2 draw away at @entity23 in the @entity24 ‘ i had n’t seen him play live before he came here , ’ @entity0 admitted			1
‘ i have my people i trust and a scouting department here i ’m working with every day			1
they know what i ’m after			1
‘ @entity1 has played in good clubs , like @entity38 , at a high level			1
i have contacts in @entity41 and they were seeing very positive things about him			1
i can now see why			1
‘ it looks like he could become a fans ’ favourite at @entity10			1
our fans like quick players , players who can go past people and who have energy			1
@entity1 had that in his game on thursday night			1
‘ that ’s the kind of team we want to be			1
we want to be similar to how @entity58 were - that ’s our goal			2
maybe not so wide , but very aggressive and hungry to win the ball			2
’ noted for a raft of yellow and red cards during his time in @entity41 football , @entity1 brought aggression and flair to @entity10 ’s attacking efforts			1
he also brought a flair for the dramatic , one instance of rolling around following a heavy challenge from a @entity23 player showing a hint of cynicism			2
yet @entity0 prefers to couch what he brings to the @entity10 team in more diplomatic terms			1
‘ he has a lot of confidence , ’ the @entity82 manager continued			1
‘ @entity86 players are different from @entity88 players , of course			2
it ’s a different culture			2
but i ’ve worked a lot with @entity86 players and they need to be loved , like everyone else			2
i think he will develop			2
‘ it ’s good that he ’s been in @entity88 now for many years			2
had he come straight from @entity86 , then i would have been more afraid			2
‘ it ’s also easier to be like that in an attacking rather than a defensive position			2
‘ he ’s working hard and tactically he ’s been good			2
‘ he takes cares of himself			2
he has natural talent there			2
but he needs time , he has a lot more to come			2
@entity10 manager @entity0 had never seen the @entity5 play before sanctioning a one - year loan move ‘ he needs to be quicker and sharper , but that will come when he gets games			1
‘ he did n’t get back to @entity110 from international duty last week until the friday night , so that ’s why he did n’t play against @entity113			1
i had n’t seen him in training			2
‘ but he trained well this week , so he got the chance against @entity23			2
he was very good in the game			0
it was very nice to see			0
‘ he gives us another weapon in the wide midfield positions			0
he can eliminate players , get past them and he is good on the ball			0
that ’s what i wanted to see and i ’m happy for him			0
’ @entity1 ’s 14th - minute strike , a controlled first - time effort from the edge of the box showed what @entity0 described as ‘ fantastic technique , ’ adding : ‘ i hope he does more of that			1
it was a difficult shot to take on			0
he had a positive impact on the game			0
i want wingers who can work the pitch both ways , defensively and offensively , and he can do that			0
it ’s very positive for us			0
’ to suggest @entity1 has already shown enough for a permanent agreement would be premature			0
on loan from wealthy @entity144 club @entity143 , there is also no guarantee @entity10 could afford him			1
if the @entity110 champions wish to sign @entity148 or @entity149 , they already know what they must pay			0
asked if the same applied to @entity1 , @entity0 was nimble on his feet			1
‘ i know what the fee is , ’ he said , ‘ but i wo n’t share it			0
we ’ll see if it ’s affordable but there is always a negotiation			0
’ that sounded for all the world like he would n’t be within their price range , but the @entity82 boss insisted : ‘ we would n’t bring him here if it was not possible			0
’ @entity1 is one of four loan players , @entity10 paying a fee for just one player when they signed @entity172 @entity171 for £ 2.2million			1
the early signs are mixed			0
tall , but not imbued with great physical strength , @entity171 is no @entity175			0
in two games against @entity113 and @entity23 , his impact has been constrained to fleeting glimpses of ability			0
@entity1 ( left , next to @entity171 ) has all the tools to become a cult hero at @entity182 this season ‘ i think he was better in the second half against @entity23 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he came more into the game			0
‘ he has n’t played much and he needs to adapt			0
i see in training and in games that he has good qualities			0
i know in time he will succeed here			0
‘ he needs to work on his physical side			0
it ’s more physical here than in @entity41 and he needs to work on his upper body			0
‘ he needs more power but he ’s into the training and wants to develop so that will come			0
’ @entity171 , himself , admits he needs to bulk up and adapt to a @entity110 game significantly more physical than he is accustomed to			0
‘ i need time to get used to @entity110 football but i think hard work on the training pitch and gym will make things okay , ’ said the new @entity200			0
‘ i will get a programme for the gym and , in time , everything will be how i expect			0
‘ sometimes strikers do n’t score for three games but then score in two or three in a row			0
‘ the most important thing is we won the game against @entity113 and then took a point away in @entity88			0
‘ now we have to concentrate on the game against @entity216			0
’ captain @entity217 was returning to @entity110 via @entity218 yesterday after missing @entity10 ’s flight home			1
unable to produce a urine sample for drugs testers before @entity223 closed , the skipper is expected to play against @entity216 tomorrow			1
@entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 are still out , while @entity171 is also struggling with a dead leg			0
@entity230 is available after being ineligible for the @entity24 .			1
