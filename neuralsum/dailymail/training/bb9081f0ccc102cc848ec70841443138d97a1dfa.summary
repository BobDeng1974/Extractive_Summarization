by @entity0 it appears to promote the idea that women ca n’t park			0
but officials hope they wo n’t be complaining when it means they get a prime spot in the centre of town			0
these extra-large parking spaces have been created in a £ 60million scheme to make @entity11 , in @entity12 , more female friendly			1
women only : a £ 60m scheme in @entity11 , @entity12 , has designated parking bays for women only , which are marked with pink outlines and a figure wearing a skirt the spaces , dubbed ‘ she - spots ’ , are longer and wider – 8ft 2.5in rather than 7ft 6.5in – than standard and are marked with bright pink outlines and a female logo			1
they will also receive better lighting and be placed closer to shops			2
the authorities say they created the spaces for safety reasons , and not because of women ’s reversing skills			1
though it is not clear whether men who park in the spots will incur a fine			2
the scheme in @entity11 will also see pavements resurfaced with a ‘ slightly spongy material ’ that makes them easier to walk on in high heels			1
as part of the effort , around 7,000 new toilets just for women will also be installed across the city			0
some @entity12 welcomed the news , particularly as the spots will be located near shopping mall elevators and escalators			1

‘ it ’s been a great marketing gimmick			0
women can come here and prove me wrong , and while they ’re at it they can see the town ’s attractions			0
