as soon as @entity1 declared @entity4 's @entity3 final against @entity5 as the most important final of his distinguished managerial career , it was hard to see past @entity1 's side			1
and that could , in part , be down to the @entity4 manager 's brilliant record in cup finals : he 's lost just one final across 11 full seasons as a coach , winning 10 along the way plus seven league titles and four @entity19			1
that makes it 21 trophies across 727 games , an average of a winner 's medal every 35 matches			2
@entity1 holds the @entity3 aloft , it is the 21st trophy of his career as a manager the @entity33 coach lifts the cup in delight , and he believes ' finals are not for playing , they are for winning ' the ecstatic @entity4 boss showed a contrasting mood to the miserable figure from recent press conferences june 15 , 2003 : @entity41 final			1
@entity44 1 - 0 @entity43			2

' finals are not for playing , they are for winning , ' @entity1 said at full - time at @entity72 , and he certainly believes in his own words given the impressive record he holds on show - piece occasions like sunday			1
victory over @entity5 ended a two - year mini-drought for @entity1 , having come through a difficult final season at @entity66 before failing in all three cup competitions and finishing third in the @entity80 with @entity4 last season			1
that was his longest stretch without a trophy while in constant employment as a manager - and sunday marked his first cup final success in almost four years			1
the only final that a @entity1 - led team has been beaten in came in 2013 's @entity91 final when @entity66 were defeated 2 - 1 by local rivals @entity68 - and even then it took extra time to kill off @entity1			1
prior to that though , he had won all nine of his previous finals , picking up the @entity41 , @entity46 and @entity50 with @entity44 , two @entity98 and an @entity56 in his first spell at @entity4 , a @entity59 and @entity50 with @entity60 and a @entity64 with @entity66			0
the stats show @entity4 's master motivator knows how to gee up his players for the big occasion : you do n't have such a strong record without that ability			0
' for me , it 's important to feel that i 'm a kid , ' @entity1 said after the game at @entity72			2
@entity1 celebrates in front of his supporters with his @entity46 winner 's medal after beating @entity47 @entity1 's career as a top coach really took off when he won the @entity50 with @entity44 in 2004 @entity1 started his @entity4 trophy haul with a @entity3 victory in @entity118 in 2005 after extra time back - to - back titles with @entity4 in 2004 - 05 ( left ) and 2005 - 06 ( right ) kept @entity1 happy at @entity4 @entity1 poses with the @entity120 , won with @entity4 again in @entity118 to add to his title in 2005 the special one won his second @entity3 in @entity118 in 2007 , with @entity123 seeing off @entity54 @entity123 was again up for the big occasion as @entity1 won the @entity56 at the new @entity72 's first cup final ' and before the game , i had the same feelings as my first final however many years ago			1
' it 's important to feel the same happiness after the victory , and to feel like a kid at 52 years old			0
' it 's difficult for me to live without titles			0
i need to feed myself with titles			0
this is important for me and the boys			0

' this is a good problem , to have that feeling that two years is a long time			0
that 's a good feeling			0
' with @entity1 giving his players just 20 minutes to celebrate before thoughts were focused back on their @entity80 title charge , @entity1 will hope to add a couple more trophies in the 13 games ( or as many as 18 if they reach the @entity50 final ) before the end of the season			2
and now that he 's managed to give his new squad the big game pedigree that they needed , few would back against the @entity33 coach to add to his rich honours list			0
@entity1 joins his @entity60 players after winning a second successive @entity139 title in his second year in @entity60 a second @entity50 title for @entity1 came at @entity60 with a 2 - 0 final win over @entity63 @entity1 waves to @entity66 supporters during the celebrations after winning the @entity141 title in 2012 serial winner @entity1 celebrates after victory over @entity5 at @entity72 with his @entity4 players			1

@entity4 beat @entity5 2 - 0 at @entity72 to win the @entity3
it marked @entity1 's 21st trophy of his managerial career
he averages a trophy every 35 games across his distinguished career
@entity1 spoke after the cup final win of his need to ' feed ' on trophies
