' but the idea of taking time off , i think it ’s quite important			1
and unlike his predecessor , president @entity40 , who stopped golfing two years into his tenure because he felt ' playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal , ' @entity2 refused to give up the sport , even when the country was in the midst of a crisis			1
@entity10 pointed out to @entity0 on wednesday that ' a lot of presidents golf ' and they ' get in trouble ' for it			1
' how important are vacations when you have that job ? ' the comedian asked @entity0			2
' how important is it to go somewhere , be it four hours on a golf course , to just get away from your job , or is your job too important to try to get away ? ' not missing a beat , @entity0 replied , to laughter , ' well , first of all , they can always get you if they need you ' and noted that the president is always followed around by an agent carrying the nuclear ' football			1
' ' and you always have global communication			0
i 've had a lot of international phone calls on golf courses , ' he revealed			1
' when it was going poorly , did you claim you ever claim you had an international call ? ' @entity81 pondered			0
' that never occurred to me , ' @entity0 reflected			0
' where were you when i needed you ? ' @entity2 has played more than 200 rounds of golf since he 's been in office			1
but @entity0 said that does n't say anything about his character , or the character of any previous presidents who often played the sport			2
' on balance , none of these people would have had the job if they were lazy , ' he said , ' and i think we ought to be tolerant			2
' @entity0 has been out of the @entity97 since 2001			0
he could find himself living there again , though , if his wife , @entity99 , runs for and wins the presidency next year			0
@entity10 tried to smoke out @entity99 's intentions asking @entity0 if he is in the market for a new home			2
' i hope not , because 2016 is the election year and i do n't have any place to move , ' @entity0 responded			0
