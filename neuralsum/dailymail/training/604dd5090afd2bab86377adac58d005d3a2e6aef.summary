a couple who unearthed a time capsule dated 1978 hidden away in their wall have found the man who left in there when he was just 12 years old			2
@entity6 and his partner were renovating their house in @entity10 , @entity11 , when they pulled away a wall panel to find a plastic bag hidden there more than 36 years ago			1
the package contained a note , a few coins , a newspaper cutting and a @entity21 's scratch card - and was signed by seventh - grader @entity22			1
times a-changing : @entity22 , shown left as a schoolboy , hid a time capsule in the wall of his home in @entity10 , @entity11 , when he was 12			2
now he is aged 49 ( right ) , the capsule has been rediscovered ' hello whoever finds this ' : the 12 - year - old @entity22 explained in the note that his dad 's @entity31 was giving him the chance to hide the note away			1
he also provided ' proof ' of the date the note read : ' hello to whoever finds this			0
today my dad is putting up paneling			0
' today is november 18th , 1978 , 15 till 12:00 noon			0
i 'm 12 years old and a student at @entity44 , 7th grade			0
' i am 5 ' 3 , blond hair , hazel eyes			0
here is proof of the date			0
' discovery : @entity6 and his partner , pictured , found the capsule inside the wall of the same home while the were renovating @entity57 's baseball quiz : the plastic bag containing a note , coins - and this scratchcard from a @entity21 's restaurant laid out : above the items which were removed from the plastic bag can be seen at first , @entity6 had no idea who @entity22 really was - and his own searches came to nothing			1
but after telling his story to local news station @entity72 , news the capsule had been found made it across the country to the boy - now grown into a 49 - year - old man			2
@entity22 , who lives in @entity77 , @entity78 , said he was inundated with messages after the local news story - and realized the boy in question must have been his schoolboy self			1
home : pictured above is the house in @entity10 , @entity11 , which concealed the capsule for 36 years he told @entity87 : ' i watched the video link and was like , ‘ oh my gosh			1
' recalling the moment he stashed away the package , he said : ' i wrote the note and it was n’t enough and i needed proof of the date so i tore off a newspaper			0
' i do n’t have any recollection of the @entity21 ’s ticket - my guess is i just ran off into my room and grabbed whatever i could find with the date on it and just stuck it in the baggy and threw it in the wall			2
