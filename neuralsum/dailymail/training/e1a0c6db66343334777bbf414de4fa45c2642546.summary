by @entity0 published : 20:52 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 21:01 est , 25 november 2013 @entity2 has become so commercialised it has lost its true meaning , @entity1 has warned			1
the former home secretary claimed ‘ fairy lights , tinsel and extravagant presents ’ have made us forget about those who do not have families to celebrate with			1
mr @entity1 used the example of one of his constituents – who organises an annual @entity2 lunch for hundreds of lonely and homeless people – to highlight the importance of helping others over the festive period			1
@entity1 has warned that @entity2 has become so commercialised it has lost its true meaning saying we should be ‘ counting our blessings ’ rather than feeling sorry for ourselves , he urged families to relearn the ‘ true spirit of @entity2 ’ by inviting less fortunate into their homes			1
he told the @entity25 [ must credit ] : ‘ @entity26 published @entity27 in 1843 , introducing the world to @entity29 and @entity30 it remains perhaps the most popular @entity2 fiction story of our time			1
‘ but since it was written , it saddens me that @entity2 has become so commercialised and over-hyped that its true meaning has become lost beneath the welter of fairy lights , tinsel and extravagant presents			1
‘ but despite what i say , i am not a @entity29			0
i like @entity2 and recall with fondness the simpler @entity39 of my childhood			2
it ’s an occasion when most of us look forward to spending time with family and those we love			0
the former home secretary told the @entity25 ¿ fairy lights , tinsel and extravagant presents ¿ have made us forget about those who do not have families to celebrate with ‘ nevertheless , for some , @entity2 will bring only heartache and loneliness , and the thought of families getting together to celebrate serves only to make the loneliness worse			1
’ mr @entity1 said the story of one woman in his @entity59 constituency was ‘ heart - warming ’			0
every @entity2 for the past six years , @entity60 , 63 , has organised a lunch for lonely and homeless people by gathering funds , food donations and volunteers from local businesses			2
in the past , the event – staffed by volunteers from a bank branch – has welcomed single mothers , dementia patients and a 105 - year - old pensioner			0
he said : ‘ her story began in november 2008 , when she attended a hospital appointment and asked those around her whether they were looking forward to @entity2			2
‘ she was shocked to find that many of those she spoke to were not			0
in fact , they were dreading the festive period as they found it a very lonely time , and one elderly lady was preparing yet again to spend @entity2 alone in bed			0
‘ although not in the best of health herself , @entity60 had the idea of organising a @entity2 lunch for some of the hundreds of people destined to spend the season in isolation			1
believing that there must be others in the community who felt as she did and would be willing to help , she set about raising funds			0
’ the @entity105 mp added : ‘ her first dinner was attended by 87 people and over the years , the event has grown and grown			2
this year several hundred guests will sit down to lunch , to enjoy turkey and trimmings , a singsong and a smile			0
‘ no one , least of all @entity60 , could have dreamed that her idea would have expanded in the way that it has and become a major event in @entity59			0
it is a massive logistical task but each year , she manages to pull it off			0
’ mr @entity1 said we should take inspiration from mrs @entity60 and welcome others into our homes on @entity2 or help create similar festive occasions			2
he said : ‘ i hope that this and other examples of the true spirit of @entity2 will warm not just the hearts of those embraced by such events but those of us who , from time to time , are guilty of feeling a bit sorry for ourselves when we should be counting our blessings			1
