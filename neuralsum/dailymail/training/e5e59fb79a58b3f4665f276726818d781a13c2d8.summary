by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter residents of a small town in @entity5 are still so angry over the shooting of a disabled resident ’s dog that they have launched an effort to oust the mayor and all of the city council members after the police officer who shot the animal was allowed to keep his job			1
officer @entity16 returned to his regular patrol shift in the small town of @entity19 on saturday , two months after the shooting that another police agency called justified			1
after the shooting , officials in the city of just over 2,500 people held public hearings but decided to keep @entity16 on the force			1
shooting : @entity28 , of the @entity29 in @entity5 , was filmed firing his gun a point blank range after being called to reports of dogs wandering in the street that angered some residents , who accused officials of not doing enough , the @entity36 reported			1
petitions to recall mayor @entity41 and all four city council members were filed tuesday			1
@entity41 told @entity0 that residents have every right to seek a recall but he did n’t go so far as to speculate whether or not the attempt to oust him would be successful			0
' i think they 're going to do their best to make the recall work , ' he said			0
' they only needed 20 ( signatures ) to start the process , and they 've gotten that far			0
' recall organizers gathered 20 signatures for each city leader 's recall petition , a procedural step that triggers an official drive			2
that gives organizers 75 days to try to get a larger amount of signatures , a required 201 per official			0
working : the seven - year - old black @entity63 named @entity64 acted as a service dog for @entity68 sufferer @entity66 that figure is 20 per cent of the number of voters registered in the last city election			2
if @entity74 approves the petitions , the city will hold a recall election			0
@entity16 was placed on administrative leave shortly after he shot and killed a 7 - year - old black @entity63 named @entity64 on february 8			1

@entity16 kicked at @entity64 before shooting him			1
the dog 's death launched protests and fiery testimony at @entity93 meetings , where many residents called for @entity16 's firing			2
an investigation by the @entity97 of @entity98 , about 150 miles northwest of @entity19 , found the shooting was justified but the independent inquiry questioned why the officer did n't stay in his vehicle , call the owner of the dogs or call for backup			1
shot : the dog , named @entity64 ( pictured ) , would not stop barking at the officer so he kicked it and then fatally shot it a phone number for @entity16 could not be located			1
@entity110 , a former longtime @entity19 resident , told the newspaper that he and others were concerned that there was no warning when the officer returned to work			2

it will be required for @entity19 police , and officers from other towns also plan to attend			2
officers have had to escort people off @entity16 's property since the shooting , @entity41 said			0
the mayor said he 's received death threats but that he did n't take them very seriously			0
but it upset him that people across the country were getting a negative perceptive of his town based on the incident , @entity41 said			0
' i hate to see that , ' he said			0
' @entity19 is a nice town : we have good staff , good people here			0
