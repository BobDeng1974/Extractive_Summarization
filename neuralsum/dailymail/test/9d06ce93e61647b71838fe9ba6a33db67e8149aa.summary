a gene that affects the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate - as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals			1
@entity9 researchers discovered that a single gene called @entity11 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter			1
plant geneticists say their finding could also lead to new varieties of climate change - resistant cocoa plants , which could boost plants ’ yields and the income of farmers			1
a gene involved in determining the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals , scientists claim			1
a stock image of chocolates is shown more than five million cocoa farmers and their families depend on cocoa for their livelihoods around the world , where @entity32 , @entity33 is cultivated in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			2
the @entity37 puts annual cocoa production worldwide at 3.8 million tons , which is valued at $ 11.8 billion ( £ 7.9 billion )			0
each cocoa pod has 40 seeds , which are composed of cocoa butter and used in the making of chocolate – and some drugs			1
lead researcher @entity46 , professor of plant molecular biology at @entity49 's @entity48 said that cocoa butter with altered melting points may find new uses in specialty chocolates , cosmetics and pharmaceuticals			1
@entity9 researchers discovered that a single gene called @entity11 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter			1

cacao trees growing at a research facility in @entity64 are pictured the world 's largest confectionary producer , joined @entity67 in november in warning of a massive shortfall of chocolate , which could reach a million tonnes a year by 2020			0
@entity72 's @entity71 said soaring demand has helped chocolate prices hit more than double what they were just eight years ago			0
industry experts say the world is in its longest production shortfall for five decades			0
@entity80 prices rose by a quarter in a year to a peak in august of £ 2,000 a tonne , nearing a february 2011 peak , @entity71 said			0
before the end of 2007 they had barely risen above £ 1,300 , according to figures from the @entity87 ( @entity87 )			0
@entity71 chief executive @entity88 said the hike was fuelled partly by a ' potential cocoa shortage ' by 2020 - echoing previous warnings by @entity92 that demand will outstrip supply			0
' the global cocoa sector may suffer a one million metric ton shortfall by 2020 because of increasing economic and environmental pressures on cocoa farms around the world , ' the firm said			0
' our long - term business depends on a sustainable supply of high quality cocoa , and we believe that securing cocoa ’s future begins with increasing yield for the smallholder farmers			0
' @entity109 and drought are partly to blame , but countries are also eating more sweets , particularly developing nations such as @entity114			0
for example , a chocolate with a higher or lower melting point would be useful for production of chocolate with specific textures and specialty applications			1
' the " snap " and " melt " of chocolate are two very important textural features that determine the appeal of chocolate to consumers , and having new varieties of the cocoa plant that produce butter with different melting points would be a valuable resource to control those characteristics , ’ professor @entity46 explained			1
‘ medical applications could include production of drug - delivery products with slower release of drugs than is possible with current cocoa - butter - based systems			2
’ professor @entity46 was previously involved in research that first described the stearoyl - acyl carrier protein desaturase ( @entity142 ) gene family in the cocoa tree			2
collaborators from the @entity146 sequenced the genome of the plant			0
now professor @entity46 and his team have discovered that a single gene - @entity11 – in the @entity142 family , is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter			1
‘ we used state - of - the - art plant science techniques to gain evidence for the role of the @entity158 gene in cocoa butter biosynthesis , ’ he explained			1
‘ the other @entity142 genes appear to play other roles in the growth of the chocolate tree , such as flower and leaf development , where these fatty acids play important roles as key components of various membrane systems			0
‘ this information can be used to develop biomarkers for screening and breeding of new cacao varieties with novel fatty acid compositions of cocoa butter			2
’ this image shows cacao seeds after harvest			0
a mixture of lipids called cocoa butter makes up about half of each seed			2
the natural melting point of cocoa butter is close to human body temperature			1
this trait gives chocolate its melt - in - your - mouth texture and provides a creamy texture to lotions applied to the skin professor @entity46 and his team have discovered that a single gene - @entity11 – in the @entity142 family , is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter			1
he said the discovery could lead to new types of chocolate , cosmetics and pharmaceuticals			0
a cocoa butter body scrub is shown left and a stock image of drugs , right cocoa butter consists of almost equal amounts of palmitic acid , stearic acid and oleic acid			2
its exact composition determines its melting temperature , which is very close to human body temperature			0
this is why chocolate feels smooth in the mouth and cosmetics containing cocoa butter have a creamy texture when applied to skin			2
‘ during cacao seed development , large amounts of fatty acids are synthesised that are rich in saturated and monounsaturated lipids , ’ professor @entity46 said			0
‘ an important part of this process is the activity of an enzyme produced by the @entity158 gene that creates a special double bond critical in determining the melting point of chocolate that is very close to the human body temperature and makes cocoa butter quite unique			1
’ ' the " snap " and " melt " of chocolate are very important textural features that determine the appeal of chocolate to consumers ( stock image ) , and having new varieties of the cocoa plant that produce butter with different melting points would be a valuable resource to control those characteristics , ’ prof @entity46 said			2

plant geneticists at @entity49 discovered that a single gene called @entity11 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter
@entity248 could lead to chocolate with unique textures and new drugs too
research could also be used to create new varieties of cocoa plants
experts hope find could profit the farmers who grow cocoa
