when president @entity1 suggested that his wife should spend extra time in paradise as an early birthday present , he was committing @entity7 citizens to pay for the gift , whose costs will likely spiral into the hundreds of thousands of dollars			1
the @entity10 conceded on monday that the federal treasury will foot the bill to fly first lady @entity13 back to @entity14 on a separate government aircraft after she finishes her extended vacation at the palatial 12 - bedroom @entity18 home of talk show legend @entity19			1
dedicated vehicles , secret service costs , and security sweeps of the @entity19 estate on @entity24 will add considerably to the total tab			1
a @entity27 reporter asked @entity10 press secretary @entity28 on monday to clarify who would get the bill for mrs. @entity13 's travel , and the spinner landed on taxpayers			2
' does that mean he 's paying for the flight back , or are the taxpayers paying for it ? ' @entity28 read from a prepared statement in his briefing binder : ' as with all personal travel , the first family will appropriately fund personal expenses , @entity67 ' ' and in line with past presidents and first ladies , the first lady will travel via government aircraft , but you are accurate in your description that this was – her decision to remain in @entity18 – the president 's suggestion that she remain in @entity18 to spend time with friends ahead of this very big birthday			1
' @entity13 will turn 50 years old on january 17			0
' if you have kids , ' @entity28 continued , going off - script , ' you know that telling your spouse they can spend a week away from home is a big present			0
' ' not that we do n't love our kids			0
' no @entity89 sendoff : president @entity13 took his daughters @entity92 and @entity93 back home without @entity13 by his side , and the federal treasury -- not the @entity92 -- will pay to bring her back separately me time : the president and @entity93 and @entity92 return to the @entity10 without @entity13 on sunday in addition to the cost of flying a government aircraft from @entity104 to @entity18 and back , @entity7 taxpayers are on the hook for the cost of mrs. @entity13 's @entity108 protection detail – and for any additional security that @entity19 's home and neighborhood might require			1
@entity112 reported monday that ' security on the island is airtight , with @entity52 teams and just about every other resource securing wide perimeters around @entity13			2
' her extended stay will likely also require the continued use of several government vehicles , including ' secure transportation ' whenever the first lady ventures out of the house , according to a former @entity108 officer who spoke on background			1
mrs. @entity13 likely has a ' standard protection detail , ' he told @entity129 , without elaborating on how many agents that would entail or what their services would cost the @entity134			2
' the flight itself would n't be a small passenger jet , ' he predicted			0
' it would be a larger military aircraft with room in its hold for cars and @entity143 , vehicles that otherwise would have come back with the rest of the family			0
' the big 5 - 0 , but no high - fashion event : @entity13 , seen at the 2013 inaugural ball , will host a scaled - down dance party at the @entity10 for her birthday , instead of a mroe typically grand affair the president 's armored suv , known in @entity14 as ' the beast , ' however , would never have been left behind			1
' that vehicle is for the president – just the president , ' the veteran agent said			0
' she does n't get to ride in it unless he 's there too			0
' the birthday festivities will continue for mrs. @entity13 when she returns to @entity14 : the @entity10 has sent out invitations for a ' @entity164 ' to be held in her honor , but attendees should n't expect a fancy dinner			1
guests have been advised ' to eat before you come			0
' there has been no word on whether the cost savings on food will make up for the expense of bringing the guest of honor back home from @entity18 .			2

the first lady remained behind in @entity18 following a 15 - day family vacation , and will stay at the 12 - bedroom island home of @entity19
mrs @entity13 will be flown home on a separate aircraft , with tax dollars covering the cost
the @entity10 *insists* she will be *responsible* for her own ' personal expenses '
@entity108 protection and dedicated vehicles will add *significantly* to the price tag of what the president described as an early birthday gift
