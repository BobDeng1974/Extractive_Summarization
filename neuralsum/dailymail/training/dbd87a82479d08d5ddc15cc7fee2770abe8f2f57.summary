there are few things more humiliating than when a pickpocket makes a monkey out of you			1
it 's only worse when that pickpocket 's a monkey			1
that 's what happened to photographer @entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , when he visited a market in @entity14 , in @entity17 's @entity16 rainforest			1
he said it came right up to him and rifled through his pockets , completely unconcerned by the shoppers - and police - milling around him			0
the bold capuchin even sneaked up on a group of children playing football and stole their ball to show off some skills of his own			1
street cap - urchin : photographer @entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , said the plucky monkey 's tricks were hilarious to watch - even when it started picking his pockets mr @entity10 said : ' we were staying in a jungle lodge when we heard about a troop of capuchin monkeys that sometimes run amok in a nearby town			1
' @entity39 are @entity41 's most intelligent monkey			2
armed with a ferocious set of teeth and a will to bite they can also be quite intimidating			0
@entity45 on the car : one monkey climbed onto a parked car , scrambled all over it and spent a couple of minutes lost in thought gazing at his own reflection ' the locals have learned the hard way that what the monkeys want , they get			1
' on the one hand they are totally endearing and always hilarious to watch , but on the other they are like a band of mischievous thugs			0
' this would - be victim cracked up laughing when she spotted the monkey , as there was nothing in her pocket for it to take			2
' the fact is , the monkey knows if there 's going to be anything to take , it will be in a pocket			2
' @entity72 : the bold capuchin also sneaked up on a group of children playing football and stole it to show off his own skills in @entity17 @entity16 , @entity41 one monkey also climbed onto a parked car , scrambled all over it and spent a couple of minutes lost in thought gazing at his own reflection			1
mr @entity10 said : ' eventually he got bored and went back to a life of crime			1
' from an anthropromorphic point of view i thought the whole thing was hilarious			2
' and from a biological viewpoint , it 's the zenith of foraging behaviour			0
' @entity39 almost never surprise me - you always have to expect the unexpected with them			0
' but it is hard not to always be laughing at them			0
i love my photos as they illustrate to me how clever and underrated these monkeys are			0
' my favourite is of the little guy standing on the football			0
he was showing off with what he could do with a football that the kids could n't			0

they were taken by @entity10 , from @entity11 , in the @entity17 @entity16

then he climbed onto car and spent minutes gazing at his own reflection
