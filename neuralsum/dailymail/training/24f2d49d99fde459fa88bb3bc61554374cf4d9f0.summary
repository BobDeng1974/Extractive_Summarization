smart internet connected sex toys are at risk from hackers , a security firm has warned			1
experts say the toys can be easily hacked , allowing people to intercept communications and take control of them			2
however , the firm behind one of the gadgets said its ' teledildonics ' are secure			2
several manufacturers now made internet connected adult toys			1
most working by interfacing with a smartphone app. @entity25 allows them to be controlled remotely , or to download new software from the internet			2
some even come with special videoconferencing software so couple can see each other			1
they also warned that one of the toys even captured video , which could easily be accessed			2
@entity36 of @entity38 partners said the firm decided to investigate the market , which has dozens of products already available and in development			2
' apparently ' cyberdildonics ' are set to be the next big thing in sex toys , allowing you to share ' sensations ' across the internet , and there is no shortage of products from various manufacturers , and even a social media site where you can get some random who you 'll probably never meet to ' drive ' your sex toy for you , ' he explained			1
' if an attacker could intercept the devices communications they could portray their victim as a monumentally inept in the stimulation department , which would be hilarious and tragic in equal measure			1
' the firm looked at toys from @entity66 , which can even use a videconferencing service			2
' there was no apparent encryption during the registration process , meaning anyone snooping on the line could get hold of login information , ' the firm told @entity76			2
' it will clearly be trivial to compromise a user 's account and access some quite juicy content , particularly so if the victim is a ' friend ' in a shared household using the same wireless access point			2
' @entity84 first launched on @entity85 , and hit back at the claims			1
' there are three layers of security			1
' the server side , the way we transfer information from the user 's phone to our server and on the client side , ' the firm told @entity99			2
' we take our customer 's private data very seriously , which is why we do n't store any on our servers			0
' having said that , we could do a better job explaining how to responsibly store any recorded sessions , and we plan to do so in the future			0
' encrypting the recorded sessions automatically consumes lots of @entity108 power and @entity109 , which as he pointed out is not able to be handled by some @entity112 handsets			0
' we hope that when our users utilize the ' record ' feature that they are doing so responsibly , just as they would with their naked selfies or videos			0
the firm currently sells the third generation of female sex toys , under the @entity66 brand			0
' using the well - known rabbit design and utilizing mobile technology , we were able to create one of the first long distance vibrators that used smartphones to control it , ' it said			1
however , it has not responded to @entity99 over the security risks highlighted by researchers			1
elsewhere , an indiegogo campaign is raising funds for a ' smart ' vibrator owners can programme themselves			0
the firm behind it hopes users will create and share their own code - and can even plug other devices into to to control			1
the gadget can be completely customised through a ' hacker port ' - and can even control other devices			1
created by @entity144 , the toy is called the @entity145 - which stands for @entity148 open - source @entity146			1
' first and foremost , it 's a great vibrator , but it is also so much more , ' they say			0
' @entity145 's software platform makes it easy for you to create vibration patterns , connect sensors and controllers , and completely customize how your @entity145 behaves			0
' users can upload new programs to it straight from a special website with no programming knowledge required			0
however , they hope that many will create their own custom code for the device			1
' if you want to dig a little deeper , you can use our software library to create custom patterns controlled by almost anything you can imagine			0
' advanced hackers will find that everything is fully - documented , giving you full control to build and contribute your own unique experiences from scratch			1
' the device is controlled from a button on the body , and also comes with a seperate ' nunchuck ' for more advanced control			1
the device has its own built in computer controller , which can easily be programmed			1
' the joystick can manipulate power and pulsing patterns , ' the firm says			0
shaking the nunchuck 's accelerometer can modulate the frequency of the vibrations			0
it can also be linked to a webcam , and analyse the image on screen			0
the more movement in the image , the more intense the @entity145 's response			0
the team has even linked it to a heartbeat sensor			0
' a heartbeat sensor lets you feel your partner 's arousal in the toy			0
' this one is a real favorite â€” it 's super cool to feel the rhythm increase with your partner 's excitement			0

claims that manufacturers need more to improve security
devices can even use videoconferencing app - which was also *flawed*
@entity84 hit back against claims and says device have three levels of security
