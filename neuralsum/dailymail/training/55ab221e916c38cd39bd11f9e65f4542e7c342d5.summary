a woman suffered a painful , five - day erection of the clitoris that left her barely able to stand			2
the 29 - year - old had been taking medication to boost her libido , but had recently upped the dose , according to a medical report of her case			1

painful : a 29 - year - old woman developed a permanent erection of the clitoris for five days			1
she had been taking two types of anti-depressant medication to boost her libido ( file picture ) when she began experiencing pain and swelling in her genital area , she stopped taking the drugs - but the symptoms got worse and worse			1
the woman was suffering from a condition called priapism			0
this usually affects men but in rare cases , can affect women too			0
the condition is where a penis or clitoris becomes engorged with blood , causing a painful , long - lasting erection			2
it is caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis			0
also , a number of medications can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of the nerves that help trigger an erection by widening the arteries in the penis			0
the nerves essentially ‘ forget ’ to narrow the arteries after the feelings of sexual arousal have passed , leading to priapism			0
those that have been linked to priapism include anti-depressants ( as this woman was taking ) , erectile dysfunction medication and some recreational drugs			2
the woman was diagnosed from a condition called priapism - for women , where the clitoris becomes engorged with blood , causing a painful , long - lasting erection ' the pain had become debilitating , as she was unable to walk , sit , or stand without significant worsening of the pain , ' according to the case report in the @entity69			1
when she was examined , doctors discovered her clitoris had become a purple colour and swollen to 2.0 × 0.7 centimeters ( 0.8 × 0.3 inches ) , @entity10 adds			0
the drugs the woman was taking , wellbutrin ( bupropion ) and trazodone , block receptors in the body called alpha - adrenergic receptors			1
