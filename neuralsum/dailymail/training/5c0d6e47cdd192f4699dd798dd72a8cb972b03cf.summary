@entity1 national security adviser @entity0 passed up a golden opportunity on friday to walk back her sunday television praise for accused @entity6 deserter sgt. @entity4 as an @entity1 who had ' served the @entity1 with honor and distinction			1
' @entity10 waded once again into controversy with comments on @entity14 's sunday morning news program ' @entity15 , ' setting off an immediate firestorm among @entity1 who had already learned that @entity4 was no ordinary hostage overseas			1
@entity20 forces in @entity21 turned him over to @entity22 on saturday after nearly five years of captivity following his voluntary walk - off from his base near the @entity27 border			1
the @entity1 released five @entity20 terror leaders in exchange , sending them to @entity30 for a one - year period of loosely defined house arrest			1
an @entity6 - led investigation conducted in the months after @entity4 's 2009 disappearance determined that he left a remote outpost deliberately an intentionally			1
that revelation put added pressure on @entity10 to clarify what she had meant			0
' i realize there has been lots of discussion and controversy around this , ' @entity10 told @entity74 during an interview near the 70th anniversary commemoration of the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79			2
' but what i was referring to was the fact that this was a young man who volunteered to serve his country in uniform at a time of war			0
that , in and of itself , is a very honorable thing			2
' @entity74 's @entity90 pressed on			0
' but " honor and distinction " ? ' he asked			0
' @entity90 , really , ' @entity10 replied			0
' this is a young man whose circumstances we are still going to learn about			0
he is , as [ are ] all @entity1 , innocent until proven guilty			0
' president @entity97 himself used the phrase ' honor and distinction last year to describe a group of 220 @entity103 , 18 sailors and 3 soldiers who were killed when a @entity108 suicide bomber attacked a @entity103 barracks in @entity110 , @entity111			1
on the thirtieth anniversary of that attack , @entity97 said ' they were faithful to their comrades in arms and served with honor and distinction in the finest tradition of the @entity1 military			1
' until sunday , that was the last time the phrase appeared in official @entity125 transcripts			0
@entity10 chose her words carefully on friday , but less so on sunday			0
asked then by host @entity128 whether she thought @entity4 would face @entity6 discipline or a court - martial upon his return , @entity10 said that ' anybody who 's been held in those conditions in captivity for five years has paid an extraordinary price			1
but that is really not the point			0
' ' the point is , he 's back , ' @entity10 declared			2
' he 's going to be safely reunited with his family			0
he served the @entity1 with honor and distinction			1
' she added that she hoped @entity4 had ' the opportunity to recover in peace and security and be reunited with his family , ' and called it ' such a joyous day			2
' @entity125 press secretary @entity148 declined to answer questions on monday about @entity10 's claim , referring reporters ' inquiries to the @entity153			1
since then , republicans on @entity155 have stepped up their pressure on @entity10			0
@entity10 ( r ) is among presdient @entity97 's most trusted aides and travels with him on @entity158 and @entity159 , alongside such @entity161 luminaries as press secretary @entity148 ( @entity163 ) @entity0 , the president 's most trusted national security aide , got in hot water by saying on june 1 that accused war deserter sgt. @entity4 had ' served the @entity1 with honor and distinction ' on tuesday , @entity172 rep. @entity171 told @entity74 that the @entity97 insider 's statement made him ' wonder about all the things the president is saying , including the fact he thinks @entity30 is going to somehow provide security so these five detainees will not be back on the battlefield			1
' on wednesday , @entity182 rep. @entity181 , who is running for @entity183 , said on @entity59 that @entity97 should ' give a full accounting for what he knew and when he knew it , and why he sent @entity0 on sunday shows to say he served " with honor and distinction			1
" @entity1 people need to know the truth			0
' @entity191 sen. @entity190 piled on a day later , complaining to @entity59 host @entity192 that @entity10 had pronounced @entity4 an honorable soldier ' before there is any @entity6 investigation			1
' @entity10 has been a @entity197 lightning rod since september 2012 when she said on five sunday political talk shows just days after the @entity200 , @entity202 terror attack that a spontaneous mob of protesters upset over an @entity1 - made anti-islam video – not armed militants allied with @entity207 – had attacked a @entity1 diplomatic post			1
she worked from a set of ' talking points ' that day , an internal summary of messages that the @entity97 administration found acceptable			2
it later emerged that officials at the @entity216 , the @entity217 and the @entity125 altered those talking points to omit mention of organized terror groups			2
@entity222 company : @entity10 ( front , l ) sat at the right hand of president @entity97 on june 5 when he met with @entity227 prime minister @entity226 ( @entity228 , center ) during the @entity230 at the @entity231 in @entity232 , @entity233 the attack and its aftermath came less than two months before president @entity97 was to stand for re-election – in part , on a message that @entity207 was ' on the run			1
' @entity10 , then the @entity1 ambassador to the @entity241 , withdrew her name from consideration for the job of secretary of state months later when @entity246 left the position			2
@entity97 later chose her as his national security adviser , a job that does n't require @entity183 confirmation			1
on friday she doubled down on the @entity200 controversy , too , ' are you being up front by the @entity1 people , ' @entity90 asked her , ' or are you being guided by talking points ? ' ' with @entity200 , ' she claimed , as has been recounted on many occasions , i provided the best information that the @entity1 government had at the time			1
parts of it turned out to be wrong			0
i regret that the information i was provided was wrong , and that i delivered it to the @entity1 people			0
' ' that does n't make me a liar			0
that makes me a public servant trying to say what we knew at the time			0
' the first draft of her talking points after the @entity200 attack included a @entity216 assessment that , ' we do know that @entity64 extremists with ties to @entity207 participated in the attack			2
' later versions described only an ' on - going ' investigation to learn ' who is responsible for the violence			0

national security adviser @entity0 said the day after @entity20 forces released accused @entity6 deserter @entity4 that he had ' served the @entity1 with honor and distinction '
@entity74 gave her a chance to walk back her praise for @entity4 on friday , but the *stubborn* @entity10 doubled down
the last time the @entity125 cited a soldier 's ' honor and distinction ' it was in 2013 when @entity97 lauded 241 @entity1 servicemen and women killed by a 1983 @entity108 suicide bomber
@entity10 defended herself on @entity74 , saying she was talking about @entity4 's decision to volunteer for the military : ' that , in and of itself , is a very honorable thing '
' but honor and distinction ? ' a surprised @entity74 reporter asked
@entity10 has been a lightning rod for @entity197 since her 2012 *flawed* claims that a terror attack on @entity1 in @entity200 , @entity202 was actually the work of a spontaneous mob upset about an anti-islam film made in the @entity1
