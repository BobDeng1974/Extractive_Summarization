historic : the @entity3 is getting a new , larger bathroom for this @entity26 ' record number of female lawmakers ' we ’re even going to have a window , ' @entity16 told the @entity11			1
ever since their numbers increased , the small size of the bathroom — the only one located just off the floor — became a ' running joke ' for the group of senators , the @entity11 said			1
' for the first time , there was a traffic jam in the @entity3 women ’s bathroom , ' sen. @entity37 , a @entity17 from @entity38 , said a week after the election according to the @entity11			1
' there were five of us in there , and there are only two stalls			0

she told seattlepi.com that the only bathroom off the @entity3 floor was for men			1
' we had to go upstairs and down a long hall , ' @entity82 said			0
eventually in 1993 a small , two - stall , restroom was constructed using space in from the men 's facility , according to the @entity54			1
it was bearable when there were less than 10 female senators			2

the women in the @entity97 got their own update in 2011 , when speaker @entity99 , an @entity101 @entity100 , directed the @entity102 to construct a female restroom adjacent to the @entity97 floor			2
