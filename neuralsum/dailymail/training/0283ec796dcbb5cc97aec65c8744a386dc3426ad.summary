a @entity1 diet ' guru ' from @entity3 puts her ultra-slim body down to an extreme diet , which can see her eat nothing but bananas for an entire day			1
known as ' @entity9 ' she advocates an extreme , low processed , low - fat , high - carb raw vegan diet			1
it 's a regime that recently came under fire when fellow @entity3 @entity15 announced she had kept up the diet throughout her pregnancy , insisting that both she and her baby suffered no ill - effects			2
consuming between 2000 and 5000 calories a day , @entity20 remains ‘ raw until four ’ - meaning she eats no cooked or heated food whatsoever until 4pm			1
she usually eats ' mono meals ' consisting of a huge amount of a single fruit , such as two entire pinapples , five mangoes , two litres of orange juice , 1.4kg of apricots , or 20 bananas			1
having suffered from both anorexia and bulimia in the past , @entity20 claims that adopting her low fat , high carbohydrate , raw , vegan diet saw her shed 40lb or 2st 12lb as well as clearing up her acne , chronic fatigue syndrome , low thyroid function and terrible digestion			1
often receiving negative comments for being too thin , @entity20 , who also writes about her diet on her website , has nonetheless gained 166,000 subscribers on her @entity1 channel preaching the benefits of her lifestyle			1
@entity20 tends to eat ' mono meals ' consisting of a single ingredient - usually fruit - in large quantities @entity20 , who is not she about showing off her figure , claims that adopting her low fat raw vegan diet saw her shed 40lb or 5st 7lb @entity20 claims that adopting her low fat raw vegan diet saw her shed 40lb or 5st 7lb @entity20 also credits her diet with clearing up her acne , chronic fatigue syndrome , low thyroid function and terrible digestion sporting a washboard flat stomach and lean limbs , it is easy to see why many are won over , especially since a key point of her diet is never to restrict calories , often eating well over daily calorie recommendations			1
@entity20 is so passionate about her way of life she has even authored an ebook on how to follow her diet , as well as her @entity95 page , website , blog and @entity1 channel			1
however several dieticians have spoken out about the dangers of cutting entire food groups out of your diet , and one aspect of @entity20 ’s lifestyle in particular , her excessive consumption of bananas , raises real concern			2
eating 30 bananas a day on a regular basis , @entity20 has posted a video to prove to those who doubted her that she can eat up to 50 bananas in a single day			2
@entity20 has posted a video to prove to those who doubted her claim that she can eat up to 50 bananas in a single day @entity20 blends up to 20 bananas at once in order to ingests the high qualities @entity20 claims that except some initial bloating directly after each smoothie ( pictured ) , her stomach remains totally flat throughout the day in the video breakfast consists of 20 bananas in a smoothie with coconut water and vanilla drops , which adds up to around 2,000 calories			1
@entity20 follows this with a ‘ lunch ’ of 10 bananas , again pulsed into a smoothie with coconut water , and a dinner of another 20 - banana smoothie			2
in total , @entity20 consumes 51 bananas in the video tutorial			0
totaling about 5,000 calories , @entity20 claims that , apart from some initial bloating directly after each smoothie , her stomach remains totally flat throughout the rest of the day			0
@entity20 says : ‘ you do n’t have to eat this many bananas - i ’m just trying to show you that you have to eat big to be lean			0
' there are so many people out there saying restrict your calories to lose weight but it ’s not true			0
‘ you need to smash in the carb calories			0
and that ’s why i do videos like this ; to show people			0
‘ i ’m a lean bean ; skinny arms and stomach , everything is lean on me and i never restrict my calories			0
sporting a perfectly flat stomach and lean limbs , it is easy to see why many are won over , especially since a key point of her diet is never to restrict calories ‘ but i have been doing this long - term , and the results are accumulating			0
i ’m fit and i ’m healthy and these are results that come with time from this lifestyle but you ’ve got to carb up ! ’ bananas are very high in potassium , a mineral essential for survival but which the body , especially the heart , is particularly sensitive to			0
a single medium banana contains an average of 422mg of potassium , and while it would be nearly impossible to cause a cardiac arrest through consuming food , eating excessive levels can put a strain on the kidneys , which have to filter out the excess			0
@entity196 spokesperson , @entity197 says : ‘ this interesting and alternative diet advocated by the @entity33 appears to have helped the lady that promotes the diet , however conflicts with traditional healthy eating advice which recommends variety , portion control and moderation			1
often garnering comments for being too thin , @entity20 has nonetheless have gained 166 thousand subscribers on her @entity1 channel preaching the benefits of her lifestyle @entity20 captioned this picture on her @entity205 account : ' seven years of eating 90 % more of my calories from fruit and more fruit than any other female on the planet , averaging between 2,500 and 3,500 calories a day			1
judge by results vs theory folks because the proof is in the banana pudding ' ‘ there are some benefits to the diet			0
for example , a well - balanced vegan diet can be extremely healthy if managed correctly , however all vegans should pay particular attention to their iron and calcium intake in addition to a @entity228 supplement			1
‘ raw fruit and vegetables retain more vitamins and minerals than cooked fruit and vegetables and controversial @entity205 sensation @entity15 hit headlines recently when she boasted she 's ' living proof that you do n’t have to become a whale when you ’re pregnant '			0
the @entity3 social media star first came under fire six months into her pregnancy , when she claimed she would continue her plant - based diet - which involved eating 20 bananas a day - throughout pregnancy			1
she says her diet has kept her in ' good shape '			0
‘ the @entity33 promotes home cooked food and including less processed food as per traditional healthy eating advice ‘ however , the negative points of this diet are quite concerning			2
this diet contains no food sources of vitamin @entity228 , limited calcium and little iron ‘ poor intake of @entity228 and @entity258 over an extended time can lead to vitamin @entity228 and iron deficiency anaemia characterised by tiredness , upset stomach , poor skin colour and easy bruising ‘ poor intake of calcium over a long time leads to low bone mineral density and brittle bones			0
‘ there is no element of portion control incorporated into these recommendations and based on scientific evidence and research , this is unlikely to lead to any weight loss if foods are consumed in the quantities recommended			0
‘ a small amount of fat is required for optimal health due to fat soluble , this diet recommends 10 per cent of calories coming from fat ( 38g/fat/day ) which may not be sufficient to meet the needs of all individuals			2
‘ the sugar and carbohydrate content of this diet is extremely high			2
a high sugar and carbohydrate diet is linked with poor dental health and poor blood sugar control in those with diabetes or at risk of diabetes ‘ eating large amounts of one food - for example bananas - can displace essential nutrients available from other foods ‘ in summary , i would always encourage my clients to include more raw fruit and vegetables in their diet , aiming for a variety of raw and cooked fruit and vegetables alongside a healthy balanced diet of portion controlled ( about the size of your fist at each meal ) starchy carbohydrates ( such as bread , rice , potato , pasta ) and protein ( meat , eggs , beans or pulses ) with two to three portions of calcium enriched foods / day ( dairy or dairy alternatives ) and limited fat , sugar and processed foods			1
