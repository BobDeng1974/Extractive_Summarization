motorists are to get a record £ 6billion boost to help remove the ‘ menace ’ of 18 million potholes from local roads over the next six years , transport secretary @entity0 announced today			1
the £ 1billion a year share - out to town halls will help @entity8 local authorities tackle potholes and improve local roads between 2015 and 2021 while giving them time to plan ahead			1
but as an ‘ incentive ’ to boost pre-emptive repairs and end the last - minute ‘ patch and mend culture ’ , an increasing proportion of the available cash will have to be won by councils bidding with the most innovative and cost - efficient longer - term schemes to keep their roads in good condition			1
as a result , the amount available to councils ‘ without strings ’ in the general repair pot will diminish over the six years			2
file photo by contrast , the ‘ incentive ’ element – which has to be bid for and can be won only by showing improvements and value for money - will increase year to year			1
local government leaders said even the £ 6billion total will leave a hole because the current backlog of repairs alone would take more than a decade and cost £ 12billion twice as much - to put right			2
a succession of severe winters and the devastating floods earlier this year have left councils playing catch - up with road maintenance			0
the size of the £ 6billion pot - hole and repairs pot was announced originally in the government ’s spending review of june 2013 but how it will be divided up between competing local authorities in @entity8 was announced today ( tuesday )			1
mr @entity0 said the investment amounts to £ 976million a year - enough to fix around 18 million potholes across the country over six years – or 3 million a year			1
he said it is the first time councils have been given ‘ locked - in ’ funding over this length of time , which will help them plan ahead and save money for the taxpayer			2
of the total £ 6billion package , just over £ 4.7billion will be shared between 115 @entity8 councils			2
but councils will also be able to bid for a further £ 575million in total available for the repair and maintenance of local highway infrastructure such as junctions , bridges and street lighting			0
but as an ‘ incentive ’ to end the last - minute ‘ patch and mend culture ’ , an increasing proportion of the available cash will have to be won by councils bidding with the most innovative and cost - efficient longer - term schemes however , mr @entity0 also announced that £ 578million had been set aside for an innovative incentive fund scheme starting in 2016 to reward councils who demonstrate they are delivering ‘ value for money ’ in carrying out cost - effective improvements can bid for specific extra cash			1
but the cash in the general pot will reduce from £ 901million in 2016 to £ 725million a year from 210/19 to 2021 inclusive as the incentive element is ratcheted up			0
ministers argue that those who move away from the ‘ patch and mend ’ mentality plan ahead pre-emptively with more certainty to improve road surfaces well before the cracks , will get more ‘ incentive ’ cash			0
the aim is ‘ to reward councils who demonstrate they are delivering high value for money to the taxpayer in carrying out cost effective planned improvements ’ and ‘ making the available money go even further			1
’ mr @entity0 said : ‘ roads play a significant part in everyday life			1
poorly - maintained local roads , blighted by potholes , are a menace to all road users , particularly during the festive period as people travel to see family and friends			1
transport secretary @entity0 , pictured , announced the £ 6billion boost to help remove the ‘ menace ’ of 18 million potholes from @entity118 's roads ‘ it is vital we have good quality roads			1
this government has already taken strong action by spending £ 1 billion more on local roads maintenance than was spent in the previous parliament			2
’ he added : ‘ this £ 6billion funding will put an end to short - term fixes and will mean we have committed £ 10billion between 2010 and 2021			1
this huge investment is part of our long - term economic plan to ensure we have a transport network fit for the 21st century			2
’ a @entity136 source said : ‘ potholes are a menace for all road users			0
he said : ‘ today we are setting out exactly what each local authority will get and announcing that the funding is being allocated over six years			0
this is the first time local authorities have been provided with certain funding over this length of time , allowing them to plan and allocate resources			0
normally it is an annual allocation			0
’ @entity149 , director of public services for @entity151 and advocate for the @entity152 , explained : ‘ councils who think about long term planning and how they work together to share their resources , achieve greater economies of scale and keep the road surface in good repair , ensuring value for money for the taxpayer			2
today ’s announcement by the government will help to deliver this			0
’ professor @entity167 , director of the @entity168 , said : ‘ this money has to be measured against the scale of the problem			0
it only amounts to about half of the £ 12billion or so road maintenance backlog in @entity8 estimated by councils themselves			0
there are also question marks over the bidding element of the funding			0
would it not be better to simply allocate it all on the basis of need ? ’ the professor added : ‘ tackling the poor state of local roads routinely tops the list of transport priorities for voters and drivers			1
no wonder , when at least 45,000 compensation claims were made in the last financial year against councils for damage caused to vehicles by pot holes			0
as many as one in six ( 16 per cent ) of drivers have been left with damage to their vehicle in the past 12 months , according to a recent survey from @entity201 .			0
