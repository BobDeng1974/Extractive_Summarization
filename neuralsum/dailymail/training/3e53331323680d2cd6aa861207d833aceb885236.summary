the @entity0 are monitoring the progress of @entity2 with sunday 's @entity4 @entity3 under threat from strong winds and heavy rainfall			1
this weekend 's race has been thrown into doubt with the typhoon making its way towards @entity4 from across the @entity12			1
@entity13 however , looks like swerving the worst of the weather caused by the typhoon - with heavier winds and stronger rainfall not expected until after the chequered flag			0
' if we focus on the main race day , the centre of the storm looks to be still offshore east of the south island of @entity4 , ' a @entity34 forecaster said			0
' the typhoon 's track is to veer north - eastwards just before it makes landfall and track up the eastern coastline of @entity4 before heading towards @entity45			0
' it actually does n't look to make landfall ( just south of @entity45 ) until well into monday daytime - therefore the winds may not have too much of an effect at the time of the race			0
' however , rain is expected , although the much heavier amounts do n't look to hit the @entity53 until later on sunday and overnight into monday , at this stage			1
' @entity55 and his partner @entity56 are pictured together ahead of this weekend 's race @entity59 driver @entity58 meets and greets enthusiastic fans on thursday heavy rain was falling over the circuit in spells throughout thursday , with the conditions set to remain in place for both of friday 's practice session			2
the path of the typhoon could yet alter and , in the worst case scenario , see the race cancelled - with no room for manoeuvre due to the @entity74 scheduled for next weekend			2
indeed @entity75 fears the race could be cancelled if the worst of the weather , predicted to fall after the race , hits @entity13 over the weekend			1
‘ @entity78 will come tomorrow , ’ he said			0
‘ the hurricane might come			0
if it comes , probably we wo n't be able to race			1
