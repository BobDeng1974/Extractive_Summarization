by @entity0 nearly half a million people are to receive surprise bank refunds averaging £ 300 on charges and interest rate debts run up on credit cards , loans , @entity7 and store cards			1
seventeen leading banks and building societies have agreed to pay up after making a blunder on the wording of credit agreements and penalty notices , the @entity9 revealed yesterday			2
some customers who were hit with penalty charges and interest rate fees over a long period could receive more than £ 1,000			1
bank refunds : some customers who were hit with penalty charges and interest rate fees over a long period could receive more than £ 1,000 ( file picture ) while the @entity9 has not named them , the 17 lenders involved are believed to include most , if not all , of the big high street names			1
their £ 149million bill comes on top of around £ 370million that @entity29 and @entity30 have agreed to pay , plus an undisclosed sum from the @entity32			1
in total , the finance industry faces a bill of more than £ 600million because executives failed to ensure documents complied with the @entity38			1
many people who were hit with the charges , which have now been ruled illegal and unfair , will have suffered real hardship as a result , perhaps struggling to put food on the table or pay the mortgage			2
the fact that they were not keeping up with debt repayments means they are likely to have been suffering money troubles that will only have been made worse by the punishing late payment fees and interest charges			0
the revelation represents a new blow for the banking industry , which already faces a bill of more than £ 20billion to refund charges linked to the sale of @entity58 ( @entity58 ) alongside loans , cards and mortgages			1
while the average refund will be some £ 300 , some people who were hit with penalty charges and interest rate fees over a long period could be entitled to payments of more than £ 1,000			1
since october 2008 , lenders have been obliged to send periodic statements to customers containing specific information and wording			2
@entity73 : the @entity9 said seventeen leading banks and building societies have agreed to pay up after making a blunder on the wording of credit agreements and penalty notices however , a bank or finance company that fails to provide the periodic statement using the correct wording is not entitled to enforce the agreement and the customer is not liable to pay interest or default sums			0
the money is to be repaid after the @entity9 wrote to 50 banks and building societies in november 2013 asking them to confirm that they had fully discharged their obligations to provide post contract information under the @entity38			1
' these issues were not deliberate misconduct , but the institutions concerned should have ensured they were complying with the law ' @entity98 , @entity9 director of consumer credit @entity98 , the @entity9 ’s director of consumer credit , said : ‘ these issues were not deliberate misconduct , but the institutions concerned should have ensured they were complying with the law			0
‘ the @entity9 welcomes the proactive steps taken to return money to customers where it was incorrectly charged			0
’ the @entity9 said customers do not need to take any action because the banks and building societies involved have agreed to contact all the customers involved			2
that raises the question as to whether consumers can trust the banks to do the right thing and take reasonable steps to trace all the people who are out of pocket and due a refund			0
there is also a question as to whether the refund will only cover the specific charges and not any additional compensation to hardship and inconvenience			0
high street names : the banks ' £ 149million bill comes on top of around £ 370million that @entity29 and @entity30 have agreed to pay , plus an undisclosed sum from the @entity32 the @entity9 said it is up to the bank to decide whether to add interest to the value of any refund of fees and charges			1
it said customer who feel aggrieved and would like to pursue additional compensation should contact the bank concerned and then , if necessary , the @entity146			0
the @entity9 has not named the 17 banks and building societies involved , however the group is believed to include most if not all the major high street names			1
' we want regulators to clamp down on excessive fees and charges so that borrowers are treated fairly whatever form of credit they ’re using ' @entity158 , which ? executive director which ? executive director @entity158 said : ‘ it ’s good to see the @entity9 taking this action but it should name and shame the 17 lenders involved so that customers are aware that they might be due compensation			1
‘ we ’d also like some assurances about how lenders will contact people who were affected but are no longer their customers			2
‘ we want regulators to clamp down on excessive fees and charges so that borrowers are treated fairly whatever form of credit they ’re using			0
’ @entity175 confirmed it will be making refunds , but refused to say how many customers are involved			0
it said : ‘ we are committed to ensuring that we provide our customers with the right information about credit agreements they have with us			0
‘ we have taken part in the @entity9 exercise and are now working to address cases where this has not happened			0
we will contact any affected customers in due course			0
