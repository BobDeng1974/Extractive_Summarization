by @entity0 she 's famous for her love of all things equine and now a set of rare vintage photos lay bare the @entity6 's affection for racing			1
the images , released ahead of @entity9 2014 , include a rare snap of the then princess @entity11 arriving at the race in 1946 with her aunt , @entity13 , princess royal and @entity14			1
others show the @entity6 enjoying the races in 1952 , shortly after ascending to the throne , and looking thrilled as her first ever @entity9 winner , @entity18 , gallops across the finish line to take the @entity20 in 1953			1
passion for racing : the then princess @entity11 arrives with her aunt , @entity23 , for @entity9 1946 by 1958 , the @entity6 had amassed another seven winners , although that did n't prevent her from celebrating delightedly as her eighth , @entity27 , took the honours			1
a keen racing fan , the @entity6 's career as a racehorse breeder and owner spans more than 60 years , and began with the handful that she was left by her father @entity34			1
since then , her horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races , including all five @entity38 classics , with the exception of the @entity40 , although she has managed a second place finish with @entity42 in 1953 and came third in 2011 with @entity43			2
while the @entity40 has so far eluded her , the @entity6 has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the @entity38 , among them @entity47 who managed to win both the @entity49 and @entity50 in 1977 , @entity51 , who triumphed in the @entity49 in 1957 and @entity52 who took the @entity54 in 1958			2
one has won ! the queen revels in her first victory with the @entity58 as @entity18 flashes across the line royal steed : the @entity6 gives @entity61 a once over following his win in the @entity64 in 1968 last year , @entity9 was the scene of yet another triumph for the @entity6 , after her filly estimate romped home to take the prestigious @entity69 at @entity9 - much to the obvious delight of the monarch			1
and it seems that this year 's event , which opens on tuesday , could prove just as lucky			1
' oh , i think she absolutely has a chance this year - without any question , ' reveals @entity9 's head of international racing , @entity80			1
' she has a fighting chance of winning the @entity69 for the second year running with @entity83 but she will also have a couple of other runners			2
' her appearance at next week 's @entity9 will be the latest in a series of engagements , which began last week with the state opening of parliament and a state visit to @entity91 for the @entity93 celebrations			1
winning : the @entity6 and the @entity94 in 1952 ( left ) and with princess @entity95 in 1958 ( right ) all smiles : the queen , accompanied by the 16th @entity98 and the @entity58 , at @entity9 in 1967 royal tradition : @entity38 monarchs , among them @entity34 , have been visiting @entity9 since 1711 passion for racing : the @entity6 and the @entity94 arrive to watch the runners at @entity9 1985 after processing down the @entity105 on thursday evening , the @entity6 spent the friday meeting world leaders and paying her respects to the fallen in @entity108 and on @entity109			1
the following day , she toured the @entity110 - now renamed @entity11 - before rushing back to the @entity38 just in time to see chestnut three - year - old @entity112 romp home to victory in the £ 1.3m @entity40			0
this week has also proved busy with the @entity116 's birthday on tuesday followed by a visit to @entity118 to open their new sports hall yesterday			2
no change : the @entity6 and the rest of the royal family are regular fixtures at @entity9 - and other meetings overjoyed : the @entity6 beams as her bay filly estimate romps home to victory in last year 's @entity69 well done ! the @entity6 gives estimate a well - earned pat on the nose			1
the filly will also run in this year 's race spotting a horse with potential is n't always easy - especially when you do n't know one end of the animal from the other			1
the perfect horse : prince @entity142 's horse @entity140 , now six , retired unbeaten in 2012 happily , @entity9 's head of international racing , @entity80 , is on hand to offer his tips on sorting the winners from the also - rans			2
what does a @entity149 ? ' make sure you get a good look at the horses ’ condition in the parade ring			0
when you ’re studying them look for the ones with gleaming summer coats			0
' it ’s also important that the horse is n’t sweating so look out for the ones that are calm and relaxed and with what we call a quiet temperament			0
' for many of them this will be the first time they ’ve seen crowds this size so how they behave is important			0
' what does ' the form ' mean ? ' form is the term used to describe the past record of any given racehorse			0
this is usually detailed in the race card next to each horse ’s name			0
' a good tip is to see if the horse has won previously over the same distance and / or ground of the race they are about to run			2
' how does going affect the outcome ? ' going ( or the ground ) is absolutely fundamental to the outcome of any given race : some horses will run on any ground but most horses will have a preference of either firm or soft conditions			0
' when you see the term ‘ good ground ’ it means somewhere in between firm and soft			0
' winning ways : @entity203 's @entity202 and his wife @entity204 @entity205 is your tip for the @entity69 ? ' i think it will be won by leading @entity210 whose trainer @entity211 has a remarkable record in the race , having won with @entity215 four times in the past			1
' @entity218 , owned by @entity219 has improved a lot - he ’s in the form of his life at the moment and is a significantly better horse than last year			0
' @entity6 ’s horse , estimate , won the race last year , but this year it ’s a much more competitive race			1
' @entity228 ? ' there is a @entity91 horse called @entity231 which was trained by @entity232 and is running in the @entity233 on saturday			0
' he got nominated for @entity9 straight after his recent win at @entity236 the other day , so that in itself is a real tip. ' who are the owners to look for ? ' flat racing is dominated by superpowers			2
i have tremendous respect for the @entity245 from @entity246 and the amount of incredible horses they have			0
' @entity202 [ ruler of @entity203 and vice president and prime minister of the @entity252 ] is massively respected - he has been investing in @entity38 racing for 40 years			0
' @entity38 is now seeing patronage from @entity255 too			0
prince @entity142 is much respected – his colours , carried by the mighty @entity140 , are the best			0
