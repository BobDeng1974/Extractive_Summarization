just when you thought it time for a period of reflection on this wonderful golfing season comes one last storyline not only intriguing in its own right but with repercussions for 2015			0
in @entity14 , @entity13 this week — yes , the place where he used to reside and where he smashed into a fire hydrant five years ago , causing his life to change irrevocably — we will witness the latest comeback of @entity16			1
@entity16 makes his comeback and could offer clues as to his future at the highest level in @entity21 past comebacks have included one from injury in 2009 and one at the masters in 2010 , when the scandalous revelations that followed his hydrant prang the previous @entity28 had finally died down			1
back then , given the nature of the man and the fact he was relatively young , you felt sure he would find his way back to the summit , and sure enough he did			0
but this one has a far more uncertain feel about it			0
when last seen , the poor soul could barely hit a shot without yelping in agony			0
at the @entity41 in august , the greatest athlete the game has seen climbed into his courtesy car with all the agility of a man in his eighties			0
the following week , we had the bleak pantomime of a limp - laden appearance at the @entity51 before , thankfully , he took himself off to try to restore an acceptable modicum of fitness and health			2
and now , a few days shy of his 39th birthday , he ’s back			0
even if he is fit enough , will @entity16 be able to compete against the likes of @entity58 ? two huge questions will dominate the landscape at the @entity62 event @entity16 usually hosts in @entity63 but which has moved to the @entity13 this year			1
will he ever be fit enough to play again on a regular basis at the highest level ? and , even if he is fit enough , will he be able to compete against the likes of @entity58 , who will be striping the ball comfortably 40 yards past him off the tee ? neither question will be fully answered in @entity21 , of course , but there will be plenty of fascinating clues			1
for starters , how will he swing the club under the tutelage of new coach @entity77 , whose specialist area is injury prevention ? during this lost year , @entity16 has watched @entity58 fulfil all his awesome potential			1
he ’s seen @entity82 golf begin the painful process of moving on and invest faith in the likes of @entity86 and the impressive @entity87			1
@entity82 golf has invested in the likes of @entity86 ( above ) and @entity87 does @entity16 have any relevance to this ongoing narrative , outside the usual amount of interest that will always be centred upon an athlete who has achieved so much ? at @entity14 this week , let ’s hope for one or two positive signs			1
given the ages of the two men , would n’t it be truly sad if we never got to witness at least one authentic @entity16 versus @entity99 ? when the pair got together for a late - night @entity82 television appearance last august , amid plenty of playful banter , @entity16 looked @entity58 in the eye at one point and said : ‘ i ’m not going to let you win a green jacket next year			1
’ fingers crossed , against the likes of @entity110 and current @entity111 champion @entity111 this week , @entity16 shows enough to suggest that , by the time @entity58 ’s first tilt at a career grand slam rolls around next april , he can ignite a contest for the ages			1
@entity117 reflection is great for @entity118 given it ’s only been two months since @entity121 claimed the winning point at the @entity117 , you might be suspicious of any film or book detailing the ‘ glory of @entity127 ’ as being rushed out for the @entity118 market			0
happily , the official film that runs over two dvds and a book proclaiming to be the ‘ inside story ’ are worthy testimonies to the events over that marvellous long weekend			0
the dvd ( @entity135 , £ 15 ) not only brings all the main highlights but is filled with extras , including an excellent hour - long ‘ @entity138 , ’ in which @entity139 goes through his week in fascinating detail			2
showdown ( @entity141 and @entity143 , £ 14.99 ) , written by @entity145 ’s golf correspondent @entity144 , fills in all the gaps the film format inevitably leaves — particularly when it follows the ‘ official ’ line			2
here we find a skilful chronicle of all the drama witnessed during the year before anyone got anywhere near the venue and the incidents from @entity127 that were left on the cutting room floor , like the fallout from @entity159 ’s comments about @entity161 ’s captaincy			2
in short , two ideal @entity118 presents for the golfer you know			0
quote of the week ‘ you could give me another 100 rounds today at the @entity168 and i would n’t sniff 63 …			2
well done @entity87 , very impressive ! ’ @entity58 , who was the defending champion , paid a warm tribute to the young @entity82 who took his title with an extraordinary , final round 63 at the @entity173 on sunday			1
a number of astute judges , including former @entity177 player @entity176 , went so far as to call it the finest round played in the tournament ’s long and illustrious history .			0

@entity16 will make his latest comeback in @entity14 , @entity13 this week
the 38 - year - old has watched @entity58 fulfil his awesome potential
@entity82 golf has invested in the likes of @entity86 and @entity87
