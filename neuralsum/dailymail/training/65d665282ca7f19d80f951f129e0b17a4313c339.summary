by @entity0 published : 06:09 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 09:24 est , 3 june 2013 @entity2 's most famous midwife , who has delivered babies for celebrities including @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , says birth in @entity2 has become ' industrialised ' , and should be stripped back to a simpler and more natural experience			1
@entity10 , 71 , from @entity11 in @entity12 , is the former president of the @entity13 , and has said she believes all babies should be given the opportunity to enter the world at home during a ' normal ' and non-medical birth			1
speaking about her new guide to birthing for mothers , @entity23 , @entity19 told the @entity25 's @entity24 : ' most women can give birth perfectly well on their own without interference			1
of course , some need a caesarean , some need extra medical care but most do n't			2
' @entity10 , left , believes all babies should have the opportunity to be born at home , and her new book , @entity23 , is a guide to giving birth for new mothers , not people within the profession she added : ' i think if women could start off with a midwife in their home , whether they are high - risk or low - risk , and then if she needs to go into hospital , she can go with them			1
' ' a brutal entry into the world , where the baby is pulled out of his mother 's body , accompanied by loud voices and bright lights , and then rubbed with a rough towel , teaches this oh - so - sensitive baby that the world is a tough place where he may not always be welcome			2
' @entity19 says : ' think of every genius you have ever heard of and the likelihood is that they will have been born at home – @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 ' an illustration from @entity23 , the new guide to having a baby by midwife @entity10 @entity19 also says the theory that children born at home will not flourish academically ( compared to those born in hospitals ) is nonsense			1
she says : ' think of every genius you have ever heard of and the likelihood is that they will have been born at home - @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69			1
' maintaing ' my life experience is that things very , very , very , very , very , very , very rarely go wrong ' , @entity19 also explains that some women have such an enjoyable experience giving birth that they can even reach orgasm - and the best place for this to happen is in the home			1
she says : ' after the birth you will snuggle in bed with your beloved partner and gaze at your baby , telling each other how very clever you are ... fragrant , joyful and transcendent			2
' she adds : ' i ca n't imagine becoming sexually aroused in a brightly lit hospital			0
can you ? ' @entity19 has been midwife for celebrities including @entity5 , left with daughter @entity103 in 2006 , and @entity6 , right making preparations in practical terms , to arrange to have your baby at home , you need to contact the community midwives in your area and ask them to book you in for a homebirth			1
it is a fairly straightforward procedure			0
you can discuss it with the midwife at your booking - in appointment , or simply ring the community midwives directly			0
in some areas , you email the homebirth team - every area is different			0
it is unlikely , though , that your doctor will know what you should do as this is not his or her area of expertise			0
if you ca n't locate the number for the community midwives in your area , ring your local @entity128 and ask them for it			0
if you have no response , contact the @entity131 at your local @entity128			0
you may want to follow up your phone call with a letter so that you have a written record that you requested a homebirth			0
once you have booked yourself in for a homebirth , you will be allocated a midwife who will start to visit you regularly at home			2
she will perform all your antenatal checks , such as taking your blood pressure and doing urine tests			0
she will also feel your tummy to see how well your baby is growing			0
she will tell you what to get ready for the birth and will give you a number to ring when you think you are in labour			2
when your due date approaches , she will bring all the things she will need for the birth and drop them off at your home			1
i keep saying ' she ' , but of course there are some male midwives , although the majority are women			0
