by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent members of the public are being urged to stop using cctv cameras to film their neighbours fears of excessive state surveillance are commonplace			1
but it seems the real spies could be closer to home – the neighbours			1
members of the public have been urged to stop using @entity13 to film those living next door after a surge in complaints			1
@entity18 , the @entity19 , appealed to people ’s ‘ common decency ’ , saying victims feel their privacy is being invaded by lenses peering into their house or garden			1
but the watchdog added that complaining to the police is often pointless because there is no law against installing cctv on private property			1
the price of security cameras has plummeted in recent years , with many homeowners buying them cheaply over the internet			0
however , mr @entity18 said anyone thinking about putting one up should ask themselves whether they really need it			0
the former senior counter-terrorism officer told the @entity43 that complaints were on the rise , adding : ‘ i ’ve got a great deal of sympathy for anybody who feels that their own private space is being invaded by the use of a cctv camera employed by a neighbour			1
‘ i can understand how invasive that feels			0
as far as i ’m aware , the police have been involved on many occasions and the response has been “ sorry , there ’s not a lot we can do ”			2
’ mr @entity18 , who was appointed in february , is drawing up official guidelines for those installing domestic cameras			2
they will be asked a series of questions about why they want them and if they are really needed			0
the code of conduct will also ask them to consider the impact on their neighbours ’ privacy			2
‘ you could say it ’s part of the code but you could also say it ’s common decency , ’ said mr @entity18			1
‘ if there ’s absolutely no requirement to impact on other people ’s privacy then , frankly , you should n’t – it ’s wrong			2
’ police do have the option of using harassment laws against @entity13 owners , he said , but the legal bar is high			1
as a last resort , members of the public can go to court to claim invasion of privacy but that is complicated and expensive			2
the price of security cameras has plummeted in recent years , with many homeowners buying them cheaply over the internet mr @entity18 also acknowledged that the use by police of automatic number plate cameras – which record the journeys of tens of millions of motorists every day – amounted to a ‘ large data grab ’ of information on innocent people			0
the devices log all vehicles that go past and capture pictures of their licence plates , along with details of where they were and at what time			0
these are then placed on a national database			0
police say the @entity123 system is an essential crime - fighting tool , but civil liberties campaigners consider it ‘ extremely intrusive ’			0
mr @entity18 said he recognised the concern that ‘ there are large numbers of cameras and the public do n’t know where they sit ’ .			0

@entity19 appealed to public ' common decency '
@entity137 victims feel their privacy is being invaded by their neighbours
but watchdog said complaining to police is pointless because installing a @entity13 camera at your home is not against the law
