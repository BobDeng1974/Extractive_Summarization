by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 12:07 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 02:50 est , 5 november 2012 president @entity4 's top campaign advisers declared on sunday that @entity6 @entity5 was in ' deep trouble ' and had no chance of winning the election on tuesday , citing president @entity11 's help as a key factor			1
' as many ups and downs as it has been in this journey - two days away from winning re-election with @entity11 on the plane - we 'd far rather be us than them , ' @entity4 spokeswoman @entity13 told reporters on board @entity22 sunday , as the president and @entity11 sat huddled together in another section of the plane			1
the 42nd and 44th @entity27 presidents are scheduled to campaign together in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 before @entity4 's final day of campaigning on monday in @entity31 , @entity29 and @entity32 , when @entity11 will hold four events in @entity34			1
the appearance came on the same day as vice president @entity36 predicted a big @entity38 win for the president			1
i do n’t think it will be close in the electoral college , i think we 're going to win clearly , ' he said during an interview with @entity54			0
' and i think you 're going to see , i think we 're going to win this state , @entity29			2
i 've been in here 23 , 24 days , something like that			0
' i think we 're going to win @entity32 , we 're going to win @entity31 , we 're going to win @entity59 , we 're going to win @entity48			1
i think we 've got an even change of winning @entity61 and @entity28 so it could be a big win			2
and it also could be close			0
but i think the firewall here of @entity29 , @entity31 , @entity32 , i think it 's going to hold firm			1
' @entity4 adviser @entity67 echoed his confidence , and insisted that the @entity5 campaign is running scared			1
' they understand that they 're in deep trouble , ' @entity67 said on ' @entity73			0
' ' they 've tried to expand the map because they know in states like @entity29 … they 're behind and they 're not catching up at this point			1
' @entity67 was referring to the @entity5 campaign 's late push to win @entity34 , a state that typically votes @entity83 but that @entity6 think they can swing to their advantage on tuesday			2

bright day : many polls are suggesting that the president may win re-election by just a point or two on the brink : the president attended rallies in the swing states of @entity59 and @entity28 on sunday reaching out : @entity4 makes a point to shake hands with one special young supporter feeling the love : he appears giddy at one event in @entity101 , @entity29 on sunday a @entity103 poll released sunday provided evidence that @entity6 ' strategy may be working : it showed @entity5 and @entity4 tied at 47 per cent support among the state 's likely voters			1
with two days until the election , national polls show @entity4 and @entity5 running neck and neck as they sprint to the finish line with jam - packed campaign schedules taking them to nearly every swing state from now until @entity38			1
but @entity67 said he 's not concerned			0
he argued that @entity5 's late trips to @entity28 and @entity119 are signs that @entity6 have n't locked up states where they should be performing well			1
' they understand that the traditional , or the battleground , states that we 've been focusing are not working out for them , ' @entity67 said			2
' now they 're looking for somewhere , desperately looking for somewhere			0
' @entity128 : former president @entity11 has appeared with @entity4 countless times but now is being used at separate campaign events like one in @entity131 , @entity132 on sunday traveling man : he also made an appearance in @entity135 on sunday , hitting key markets while both candidates ' campaigns are outwardly maintaining confidence that they will be victorious once all the votes are tallied , advisers on both sides say they are concerned about projections of a painstakingly close race			1
@entity67 said it may even take until wednesday morning to determine the winner of the election , because the race could be so close			0
' i think that some of these races are very close , and so it could extend past midnight into the morning , ' he said			0
' i do n't think by this time of the morning , we 'll still be wondering who the president is			2
' @entity11 , who maintains the highest approval rating of any former president , has been one of @entity4 's biggest assets in the final days before the election			1
@entity11 joined @entity4 in the highly contested state of @entity119 on saturday at a rally that attracted more than 24,000 supporters			1
celebrity support : @entity163 performed at an @entity29 rally for @entity4 on sunday close ties : wonder previously performed at president @entity4 's inauguration in 2008 @entity11 , @entity4 and former @entity119 gov. @entity168 took the stage in @entity119 clad in matching black jackets as @entity38 forecasters declared that @entity4 was taking the lead among early voters in @entity28 , @entity32 , @entity59 , @entity135 and @entity29			1
' as you see , i have given my voice in the service of my president , ' @entity11 told the crowd			2
a confident @entity4 heaped praise on the popular former president			1
' he has been traveling all across the country for this campaign , ' @entity4 said			2
' he 's been laying out the stakes so well that our team basically calls him the " secretary of explaining stuff			0
" ' ' he was a great president ; he has been a great friend , ' he added			0
president @entity188 is counting on former president @entity11 and @entity189 , top surrogates for his campaign , to carry his message			1
desperate for voters : actress @entity194 spoke at a @entity196 rally sunday enthusiastic : @entity194 has been an ardent supporter of the president and she was included in the @entity199 lineup but he also has enlisted an army of a-list performers and public figures -- from @entity204 to @entity205 , from @entity206 to @entity207 - to promote his re-election			0
the @entity4 campaign provided a who 's - who of 181 actors , musicians , authors , athletes , mayors , @entity217 members , and more that fit any and all demographic groups in the president 's target zone			2
all are being deployed to carry his message to television and radio in the waning days of a nip - and - tuck campaign			0

@entity268 and members of the @entity271 sitcom ' it 's @entity272 in @entity273 ' have canvassed neighborhoods in @entity31 , made phone calls and visited colleges in the state .			0

@entity4 advisers seek to project confidence that @entity5 is *doomed*
president relies on popular former president @entity11 to help him him seal the deal with voters in key battleground states
forecast of early voters in key states of @entity28 , @entity32 , @entity59 , @entity135 and @entity29 show a lean towards @entity4 but hopes for @entity5
@entity36 on their chances : ' i do n't think it will be close '
