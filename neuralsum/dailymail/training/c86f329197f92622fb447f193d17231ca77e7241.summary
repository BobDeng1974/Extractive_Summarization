@entity0 is one of the most popular events in the sporting and social calendar , with an annual attendance of nearly 300,000 people			1
dressing properly is part of the experience , at least it was until recent years when standards started to slip and spaghetti straps , mini skirts and - horror upon horrors - fascinators began showing up in the @entity15			2
in a bid to reintroduce style befitting such a prestigious event the bosses at @entity0 introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 for certain parts of the course , employing a fleet of well - dressed fashion police to enforce the rules			1
naturally , the dress code assistants ' own outfits will be under strict scrutiny and today model @entity29 unveiled the chic new designs that will be worn by the women policing the racegoers outfits			2
@entity33 heads up a group modeling the outfits of @entity0 's 2013 @entity36 bosses at @entity0 introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 for certain parts of the course , employing a fleet of well - dressed fashion police to enforce the rules the silver shift dresses and matching jackets are designed by high - end @entity45 brand @entity43 and they adhere to the rule banning strapless or spaghetti straps , and that ladies hems must be of ' modest length '			1

the specially trained team of @entity36 was first introduced in 2012			2
available outside the racecourse to help visitors with any last minute concerns over their attire the women also manned the ticket stiles to make sure that nobody wearing the wrong sort of clothing entered the stands without first being made over in accordance with the new rules			0
the assistants will be wearing the grey outfits , designed by @entity43 , and be outside @entity0 to offer advice and provide minor corrections if necessary as they did last year @entity78 seemed to be enjoying the day , which saw photographers and crowds gather to catch the first glimpse of the @entity84 's outfits alongside a brochure detailing the dressing - up dos and don'ts of the sporting festival , @entity0 organisers have launched a video to remind racegoers how long dresses ought to hang and what sort of top hats gentlemen should be wearing			1
they claim that this is is to keep the ancient tradition of the annual race alive and to make sure the atmosphere remains the same			0
at the heart of @entity0 is the @entity15 which , like the tradition of the @entity102 , dates back to the early 1800 ’s and the reign of @entity107 within this area , a strict dress code of morning dress for men and formal day wear for ladies applies , including no fascinators or thighs on display			1
guests in the @entity114 are required to wear smart dress with gentlemen required to wear a shirt and tie and ladies a hat or fascinator			0
no branded clothing or strapless outfits are allowed			0
and the final admission area , the @entity124 is the least formal enclosure with no applicable dress code , designed for those people looking for a more relaxed day out			0
