an unemployed father of 26 children , who has already raked in benefits worth more than £ 500,000 , says he deserves more money to support his huge family			1
@entity6 @entity5 , 64 , from the @entity7 has fathered 14 boys and 12 girls with 15 different women			1
he appeared on today 's @entity11 to defend his lifestyle , ahead of a @entity14 documentary airing this evening sharing his story			1
his side of the story : @entity5 said on this morning he only takes benefits for the sake of his children presenter @entity22 revealed that @entity5 is getting £ 32,678 a year in benefits in the form of child tax credits , family allowance , disability benefits , housing benefits and a state pension			1
@entity5 pointed out that the pension is his right given he worked in his youth as a doorman ( a role he admitted was largely responsible for him sleeping with so many women and fathering so many children )			1
he apologised if his large family puts a ' strain ' on the benefits system but added that he only claims for his children 's sake , not for his own			1
@entity41 : the father of 26 said he would get a job if he could ' i claim exactly what i can get from the state for my children , not for my self , ' he said			0
he added that he would work if he could			0
' i worked until taking the children on and then i became a single father , if someone wants to give me a job i 'll do it , even now with my disabilities but noone wants to give a disabled person a job , ' he said			0
while some of mr @entity5 's children have grown up and left home ( his eldest daughter is in her forties ) , he still regularly has 18 family members staying in his three - bed council house			1
six of his children aged three to 19 still live with him permanently			0
hard life : @entity5 says he needs a bigger council house and more benefits to support his family big brood : the father of 26 with some of his children ( he has 14 boys and 12 girls altogether ) and the family keeps on expanding - one of his teenage daughters has just had twins			1
as a result , mr @entity5 says there simply is n't room for them all , they have to top and tail to share beds while he sleeps on the sofa			1
' i would like a house with four bedrooms big enough to accommodate the children , ' he explained on the @entity14 documentary			2
he said he has been waiting nine years for a bigger house			2
' i 'll be dead before they even think about giving me a house , ' he moans			2
tight squeeze : @entity5 's council house on the @entity7 is n't big enough for his family ( they do not own the attached garage ) mr @entity5 's feckless behaviour has already invited the ire of taxpayers but he declares himself furious with local council leader , who recently awarded himself a 37 per cent pay rise			1
' why is he entitled to that when i 'm not entitled to a bigger bedroom ? ' he complains			0
' he did n't do anything to deserve what he 's getting			2
all he 's doing is getting money for nothing , what makes him think he 's worth that money ? ' in addition to demanding more money and a larger home , mr @entity5 complains that he and his family have been struggling since the benefit cap came in			1
furiously , he tells of how his children had to go without computer games because they were only getting £ 500 a week in benefits			2
challenge : @entity5 said people who criticise him should imagine what it 's like being a father of 26 ' when the cap came in , we lost at least £ 200 a week , ' he fumes			1
' it meant some of my children could n't have a new pair of shoes , could n't have a new pair of school trousers , could n't have stuff other children get such as @entity135 and @entity136 ... none of my children have had them and that 's because we ca n't afford them			2
' before the cap we were able to live comfortably , it 's a major drop that affected us right away			0
they did n't drop the price of food , that 's going up so you have a lot of worry and you have to juggle everything you can			2
' yet when their benefits were capped , mr @entity5 and other members of his family decided not to make up the shortfall by getting a job			1
at the time the documentary was filmed , his teenage daughter , @entity155 , was the only one employed - but she quit her waitressing job after five shifts saying it was too difficult			0
' everyone has judged for for it but i hated it , i honestly did , ' she explains			0
' all the people there would talk down to me , i would prefer to work a simple 9 - 5 , no split shifts			0
' upwardly mobile on benefits : @entity5 has successfully applied for disability allowance which means his family gets £ 800 a week ( and he gets a mobility scooter ) mr @entity5 , who walks using a stick , has now managed to boost his weekly welfare payout to £ 800 a week again - after successfully claiming disability allowance			1
but for anyone who thinks he 's got it easy , he points out it 's hard work being a father to dozens of children			0
' i would challenge anybody to come and do what i do for the children			0
people all criticise me , but come and do what i do , ' he said			0
but following his appearance on this morning , @entity5 again received a barrage of criticism from viewers who contacted the show via @entity189			1
@entity190 angrily rote : ' shocking ! he gets more than i do , and i 'm a full time nurse ! saved wages for a house deposit and it 's handed to him ! ' while @entity192 said : ' there 's just no excuse			0
the government needs to be more stricted with benefits			0
i 'm a single parent and work my butt off			0
' benefits @entity201 : life on the @entity203 is on @entity14 on monday at 9pm			0
