by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 10:07 est , 27 september 2013 after a catwalk invasion by a pair of bare - breasted feminist protesters , @entity1 got back on track on day four with strong showings from @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
while @entity12 activists were busy entertaining baffled tourists on a bateau mouche with a protest in support of @entity17 , the long awaited new collection from @entity19 at @entity7 was proving worth the wait as the designer sent an assured collection dominated by 50s style dresses down the runway , watched by @entity25 and @entity26			1
if @entity19 has his way , the prom dress will stage a comeback next summer , offering up a succession of strapless silk frocks in delicate shimmering grey overlaid with a lace patterned print in navy and ink			1
but it was n't all full - skirted gowns			2
@entity19 also showed sleek shifts with belled silk skirts in a surprisingly effective combination of blush pink and bright pumpkin as well as in @entity45 - inspired multicoloured stripes			2
striped success : @entity19 offered up tight - waisted dresses in an array of hues at @entity7 pumpkin and blush : @entity52 and orange made a surprisingly good team at @entity7 luxe : a demure dress is given a naughty twist thanks to a tiny cut out that revealed a flash of toned tummy @entity61 is the colour : but at @entity10 , fashion was the game and she demonstrated just how good she is at it with her denim - heavy vision for next summer double denim : @entity10 appeared to be intent on proving just how versatile the world 's favourite off duty fabric can be and used it repeatedly in her latest collection royal approval : princess @entity74 's daughter @entity75 was accompanied by her adorable pet dog for her front row appearance at @entity10 while @entity19 ' offering was crammed with colour , @entity10 kicked off proceedings with a low key collection of sporty separates that came in a minimalist palette of navy , black and stark white enlivened with the odd jolt of bright orange			1
@entity88 , a favourite fabric of the @entity92 - @entity91 designer , cropped up repeatedly on neatly tailored trousers , slouchy bomber jackets and even found its way onto a bustier			0
indeed , the designer appeared intent on showing just how versatile the world 's favourite off duty textile can be , such was the number of times it appeared on the catwalk			0
print was kept to a minimum and where it did appear , it came in pale grey superimposed over sky blue			0
punchy it was n't , wearable it was			0
but although @entity10 chose to keep pattern in the background , the same could n't be said for @entity9 who used a bold bright pink and cobalt blue petal print to liven up his sporty white shift dresses			1
think pink : @entity119 pink has been a popular choice this month and @entity121 also embraced it figure hugging : @entity121 included several variations on his trademark form fitting dress embellished : a fuchsia silk gown was given bold sequinned sleeves at @entity127 waterproof : @entity129 appeared to have @entity131 buyers in mind as he showed his collection accessoried with rain repelling clear plastic hats challenging : @entity129 had plenty of desirable silk pieces in fluid cream silk as well as more directional pieces such as this dress made from multicoloured ribbons graphic block print was also used , showing up on peg leg trousers , a cross-strap crop top and a slouchy 1980s style leather jacket			1
@entity147 , @entity9 's trademark were in relatively short supply but just when it seemed that the man who brought us the iconic @entity153 dress was going to end the show with more trousers , the first of a set of suitably va va voom frocks appeared at the end of the runway			0
in classic @entity9 fashion , the cinched waists and knee - length hemlines were present and correct , but this time around , they came in fuschia silk , jazzed up with dramatic sequinned sleeves , and in skin tight grey and white stripes complete with a slightly incongruous emerald leather bust patch			0
although separates have been the dominant force in @entity171 so far , @entity129 made like @entity9 and presented a collection that was festooned with frocks			0
true to form , @entity129 included a string of pieces best described as challenging before switching tack and presenting the watching fashion pack with beautifully tailored fluid silk gowns			1
lovely though @entity129 's pieces were , the title of best in show on day four was taken by @entity182 veteran @entity8 , whose expert touch with tailoring left the front row staring lustfully after the clothes as they sashayed out of sight			2
highlights included an silk shirt - dress in striking blue , green and pink block print and a delicate round - shouldered coat dress in multi-tonal striped blue and crimson organza			0
but with more than five decades of design experience , you would n't expect anything less from @entity8			2
lucky too , that unlike poor beleaguered @entity200 , no uninvited @entity199 protesters turned up to spoil the show			0
best in show : @entity182 veteran @entity8 offered an assured collection that proved to be one of the highlights of day four at @entity1 highlight : @entity8 showed that he has n't lost his talent for tailoring ( above ) and unveiled a stunning block colour shirt dress that had the @entity208 readying their credit cards meanwhile ... @entity12 activist were back up to their old tricks as they took over a bateau mouche on the @entity215 where they lit green flares in support of @entity17 baffled : tourists enjoying the @entity171 sunshine looked bemused as the @entity199 activists ran topless around the boat daubed in slogans that read ' hang captain @entity224 '			1

the fashion pack were on the edge of their seats as @entity19 latest collection for @entity7 hit the runway
@entity232 was on dresses , with full skirted strapless prom frocks dominating the finale
but @entity8 was the highlight on day four with an accomplished collection packed with wearable pieces
@entity239 , @entity121 and @entity10 also unveiled their vision for next summer
@entity12 activists were protesting nearby but could n't get into the shows and *confined* themselves to a boat
