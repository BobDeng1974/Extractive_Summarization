@entity2 , 30 , from @entity20 , was declared not guilty by reason of insanity in 2010 for killing her son @entity10 and has spent the last three years in a mental hospital receiving treatment for a condition that doctors have called ' fleeting '			1
no longer deemed a risk to society , the rehabilitated mother has been placed in @entity30 's @entity29 , known as @entity31 under which her continued recovery will be monitored closely			0
ms @entity2 was mother to @entity33 and a younger daughter who was placed in foster care while she awaited trial			1
the news of ms @entity2 ' premature release will no doubt come as a shock to many who followed the story in 2006			1
ms @entity2 was charged with torture and child abuse after @entity46 's body was discovered in her house on october 27th			1
autopsy reports showed that the boy had been beaten , scratched and starved and further investigation revealed that he had been locked in a bedroom in ms @entity2 ' house where he was strapped to the bed and watched by surveillance cameras			1
ms @entity2 was said to have used a high pressure water hose to wash feces off his body and forced her son to take baths in his own waste mixed with cleaning detergent @entity62 to deter him from relieving himself			1
on the day of his death , she admitted to having poured the highly chemical product on his genitals			0
responding to news of her client 's release on saturday , deputy public defender , @entity70 told @entity75 : ' the incident which led to ms. @entity2 ' commitment is a horrible tragedy - a tragedy which ms @entity79 will regret for the rest of her life			1
' however , i also think it is important to remember that ms @entity79 was legally insane at the time she committed the crime			2
the person she was then is not the person who she is now			0
' victim : @entity10 , 8 , was strapped to a bed by his mother who poured @entity62 on his genitals , made him wash in his own waste and starved him ms @entity70 's claims were backed up by three doctors during the trial who all testified that ms @entity79 was legally insane at the time of the torture			1
a friend of the defendant who went to see her shortly after she was taken to hospital told the @entity75 that ms @entity79 was genuinely ' shocked ' to hear of her son 's death			2
she told her friend that she had learned her parenting skills from watching ants while growing up in the projects of @entity20			0
' of course , i thought she meant " aunts " ' , said the woman who preferred to remain anonymous			0
' no , she meant the insects			0
' though ms @entity2 ' medical records are kept strictly private , she was described by one attorney as having paranoid delusions			1
mr @entity117 quoted doctors in @entity119 as describing her condition as ' a mental illness than can be fleeting			2
' explaining the way the law treats insanity cases such as ms @entity79 ' , deputy district attorney @entity117 said : ' as unfortunate as it may be , a person can suffer a short period of insanity and not be held accountable for the crimes they commit , however heinous they may be			2
' it is a difficult part of our justice system to accept , especially under circumstances such as these			0
' he also added that a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict in a burglary case would be given the same punishment as a murder case			2
the @entity144 's office raised objections to ms @entity2 ' release in february but since all the defendant 's doctors at @entity149 supported it and called her a ' model patient ' , mr @entity117 did not pursue a trial			1
for ms @entity70 , the reversal has shown the remarkable way in which the mentally ill can be given a second chance provided they receive the right treatment and support			2
she referred to the agreement made between doctors , lawyers and judges , ' an insurmountable task			2
' sentenced : ms @entity2 has served only three years in a mental hospital and has been released on the advice of doctors who called her mental condition at the time of the torture ' fleeting ' and her transformation , remarkable while ms @entity79 ' attorney and doctors have applauded her recovery and have pointed to her work with ' @entity176 ' , a program she co-facilitated at the hospital , her nameless friend has called her transformation ' remarkable '			1
' for her , being in @entity119 has been a real gift , and she took it as that , ' she said			0
' one of her graces is she really wanted to take responsibility and wanted help and took advantage of every opportunity that she could			0
' but one person struggling to understand the transformation so readily is @entity46 's father , @entity187			0
' how can three years pass and she be ok after the acts that she did ? how could someone who put @entity193 in a child 's food , allow a child to jump from a second - story building , how could they be a model patient ? ' he wonders			1
' i still have so many questions			0
' still , even despite the way in which his young son 's life ended , mr @entity10 has astonishingly found a way to forgive ms @entity2			1
' in the beginning , i really wanted to see her suffer because she had made him suffer , ' he admitted			0
" but i ca n't pass judgment , i was n't in the home			0
i forgive her , as crazy as that may sound , because of the faith that i have			0
who am i to beat her down and dog her ? '			0
