@entity0 narrowly leads the pack of potential @entity3 presidential candidates in a poll of @entity6 residents released friday , but @entity7 crushes the competition when his name is added to the field			1
@entity0 , the cantankerous and controversial @entity11 governor , emerged as the most polarizing name on a list of 13 politicians presented during a phone poll between june 19 and july 1			2
while 46 per cent of @entity6 @entity3 like him , another 36 per cent do n't			1
and he topped the list when @entity3 respondents were asked who they definitely would not vote for			0
but with 19 per cent support in a hypothetical presidential primary , @entity0 has emerged as the flavor - of - the - month front - runner			1
@entity0 is in front , but for how long ? as his waistline shrinks , his support in early primary states could drop as well cheshire cat : @entity7 , the former @entity3 presidential nominee , has campaigned in @entity6 for @entity32 candidate @entity31 , drawing fans wearing his 2012 campaign t - shirts its @entity7 : @entity7 emerged as the dominant force in @entity6 @entity3 politics on friday , crushing the competition in a hypothetical 2016 presidential primary matchup all 13 potential @entity3 candidates in the @entity41 have either fed speculation about their plans for 2016 or allowed pundits to place their names in contention			1
but former @entity47 gov. @entity7 , who has said he will not run for president again , comes out far ahead when his name is added to the mix – posting numbers nearly as dominant as @entity52 's in the @entity54 field			1
if he were to get into the race today , polling data show , he would lead @entity0 and @entity58 sen. @entity57 by a 39 - 7 margin			1
former @entity61 gov. @entity60 , @entity63 gov. @entity62 , former @entity65 gov. @entity64 , @entity67 sen. @entity66 and @entity61 sen. @entity68 would trail behind with 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 and 2 per cent , respectively			0
' look , i 'm not surprised that @entity7 is still well - liked in @entity71 , ' a @entity3 campaign consultant told @entity72 on friday			2
' he was governor right next door , and as president @entity75 becomes more and more unpopular there 's a sense of buyer 's remorse			0
' ' but ultimately , he 's just going to suck the oxygen out of the room and that 's not too helpful to the people who are actually going to run in 2016			0
' without @entity7 , the second tier reclaims some of that oxygen			2
following @entity0 's 19 per cent showing comes @entity57 with 14 per cent , @entity60 with 11 , @entity68 and @entity64 tied at 8 , and @entity66 and @entity62 with 5 percent – sharing that low perch with @entity88 rep. @entity87			1
@entity87 was @entity7 's ill - fated running mate in 2012 , and has the distinction of being the most - liked potential @entity90 hopeful in the @entity6 field			1
second tier : sens. @entity57 ( @entity93 ) and @entity68 ( c ) , and former @entity61 gov. @entity60 ( r ) round out the main group of also - rans hey , girl : rep. @entity87 , who shared the @entity3 ticket with @entity7 in 2012 , is the candidate with the highest favorability ratings among @entity6 republicans the affable budget hawk is liked by 55 per cent of surveyed @entity3 , while just 18 per cent say they view him unfavorably			1
his net 37 per cent ' likeability ' number is a stark contrast with @entity0 's 10 per cent			1
the @entity11 governor and @entity106 chairman has his work cut out for him , and has already started making the @entity6 a regular stop on his political travel schedule			0
' @entity109 ' : as president @entity75 's scandals swirl around him , some in @entity6 have new enthusiasm for his 2012 opponent @entity7 he made a fundraising trip to @entity6 to support @entity3 gubernatorial candidate @entity116 in june , just days after phone calls for the poll began			1
@entity0 will return for another fundraiser on july 31			0
but his image has taken significant hits in the past 12 months because of a scandal related to senior staffers ' alleged use of the famed @entity125 to create traffic jams in a town whose @entity54 mayor declined to endorse his re-election bid			0
@entity7 has been in @entity6 too , campaigning for @entity32 candidate @entity31			1
@entity31 trails @entity54 sen. @entity130 by 12 points in the latest poll , doubling an earlier margin			0
if @entity31 stumbles in november or fails to win his party 's @entity32 primary , @entity7 will be seen as damaged goods with limited appeal			2
and as the man who lost to president @entity75 , insiders are keenly aware that he might repeat his failure if he ran again			0
' it 's that old definition of insanity , doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result , ' the campaign operative cautioned			0
the @entity6 @entity3 declined to comment			0
democrats in the @entity6 poll put former first lady and secretary of state @entity52 far ahead of anyone else , but her numbers are beginning to fade			2
in january a whopping 74 per cent of @entity54 polled in @entity6 said they planned to vote for her in the first - in - the - nation primary			2
now that figure is down to 59 per cent , with vice president @entity155 coming in a distant second at 14 per cent , followed by @entity47 sen. @entity157 with 8 per cent			0
bringing up the rear were @entity160 sen. @entity159 ( 5 per cent ) , @entity162 gov. @entity161 ( 3 per cent ) , and @entity164 sen. @entity163 of @entity164 ( 1 per cent ) .			0

the @entity41 gives @entity0 a first - place 19 per cent showing among @entity6 republicans
but when @entity7 is added to the mix , he draws 39 - percent support and leaves everyone else in single digits
@entity87 has the highest ' favorable ' numbers of the field , at 55 per cent
@entity0 's 46 per cent favorable number is soft since a separate 36 per cent say they do n't like him
when asked which potential @entity90 hopeful they would never support , more republicans name @entity0 than any other pol
