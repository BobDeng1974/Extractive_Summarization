by @entity0 @entity1 has someone she ’d like her daughter @entity5 's partner @entity4 to call : her pastor ! the momager was all smiles in the premiere episode of @entity10 on sunday night when @entity5 , 35 , confirmed that she is indeed pregnant with her third child with @entity4 , 31			1
they are already the parents of four - year - old son @entity13 and daughter @entity14 , 23 months			0
@entity5 and @entity4 have been together for eight years and have two children , soon to be three			1
but the numbers do n't add up for @entity1			1
she thinks they ought to commit to each other by getting married calling the shots : @entity1 brings a smile to @entity24 this afternoon as she gets ready to fly out of town			0
she 's delighted to be a grandma again , but want @entity5 and @entity4 to seal the deal but although momager @entity1 is thrilled she ’s going to be a grandma again in december ; behind the scenes she ’s not so thrilled that her daughter and her boyfriend of the past eight years have still not made it down the aisle			1
‘ committing to parent three kids , when you have n’t even committed to each other does n’t cut it in @entity1 ’s book , ’ says a family friend			1
‘ she comes from a time when , if a girl got pregnant and was still single , she got married as soon as possible			0
' and although she understands times have changed , she still has religious values and feels it ’s only right that @entity4 make an " honest woman " out of her little girl			0
’ in fact , 58 - year - old @entity1 regularly attends church services at the @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 - a church founded by … her			1
she used to attend a @entity55 in @entity56 where she listened to sermons by rev. @entity58			0
married , no children : they 've split now , but @entity60 married @entity61 even though they did n't have kids			2
the ceremony was presided over by pastor @entity58 , the man @entity1 would like to perform @entity5 's ceremony married , one child : @entity67 and @entity68 waited only a year after baby @entity69 was born before they walked down an @entity73 aisle last month but when the pastor resigned in disgrace over his affair with a mistress – who he has since married – @entity1 tracked him down at his new job serving up coffee at @entity81 , and made him an offer he could n’t refuse			1
now they are partners in a church that boasts giving people second chances			0
but besides that , he can marry people			0
in fact , he performed the september 2009 marriage ceremony between @entity60 and @entity92 , making him only a phone call away should @entity4 and @entity5 decide to tie the knot			1
@entity5 and @entity4 have been together since 2006			2
and although he bought her a ring in 2011 he says she is the one who did n’t want to get married			0
‘ up until now @entity5 has n’t been interested in getting married , but at 35 , she ’s beginning to feel it ’s time			0
she ’s expecting the couple ’s third child and if @entity4 would agree to a small , quiet ceremony – nothing like the one @entity67 just had – i think she ’d be up for it			2
' pressure : if @entity1 has anything to say about it , @entity5 and @entity4 will be married by the time the new baby is born			1
says a family friend : ' maybe there 's still a part of @entity5 that wants to make sure that at 31 , @entity4 has outgrown his bad behavior before she agrees to make it legal ' but suddenly @entity4 is saying , ‘ why fix it if it ’s not broken ? ’ so the subject of marriage once again seems at a standstill			1
@entity1 on the other hand fears the old adage still rings true ; why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free ? ’ and she says if @entity5 does n’t stand up to @entity4 and insist on a wedding , she ’ll end up a lonely 40 - year - old woman with three kids and no husband			1
‘ it ’s no secret that @entity4 and @entity5 have had their share of ups and downs , ’ adds the source			2
‘ all you have to do is watch their reality show to know that			0
he ’s been arrested for @entity133 , he ’s been in and out of rehab , and he ’s had anger issues where he ’s put his fist through a mirror while arguing with @entity5			0
‘ so maybe there ’s still a part of @entity5 that wants to make sure that at 31 , @entity4 has outgrown his bad behavior and is ready to be a proper husband , before she agrees to make it legal			2
’ not a great holiday ? meanwhile , @entity4 was seen leaving his @entity145 house with a @entity147 duffel bag monday			0

@entity5 and @entity4 have been together for eight years and they are about to have their third child . the numbers do n't add up for mom @entity1
committing to have three kids when you ca n't commit to each other does n't cut it for @entity1
@entity1 regularly attends services at @entity161 founded by *...* @entity1
she *handpicked* the pastor , who performed @entity60 's ceremony , and she wants him to perform @entity5 's too
