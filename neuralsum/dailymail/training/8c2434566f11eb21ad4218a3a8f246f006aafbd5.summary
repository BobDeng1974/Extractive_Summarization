i feel sorry for him			2
when he pleaded guilty , i could see in his eyes he knew how serious it was			2

' i asked him to leave nicely but he started kicking off			2
' we struggled , but we were getting him out , then someone grabbed me from behind			1
we never found out who it was because the cameras did n't pick it up			0
