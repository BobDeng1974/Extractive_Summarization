by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 09:44 est , 5 november 2013 electronic ink printed on a plastic film has been used to make a transparent keyboard that can play music			1
scientists have demonstrated a new method of printing graphene - based ink on the flexible instrument , which they say could be used to make inexpensive printed electronics			1
they believe graphene could be used in printed electronic devices such as heart monitors and other thin sensors			1
the scientists designed their piano in collaboration with @entity17			0
here , a paper print - out of piano keys with the correct spacing , is placed beneath the plastic keyboard to make it look more conventional dr @entity23 , dr @entity24 and professor @entity25 at the @entity27 's @entity26 , invented the graphene - based ink and said just like graphene , the material has a number of interesting properties , including flexibility , optical transparency , and electrical conductivity			1
the scientists designed their piano in collaboration with @entity17 and its keys are made from graphene - based inks , which have been printed onto a plastic film			1
these keys , working as electrodes , are connected to a simple electronic circuit - board , a battery and speaker			1
when a person touches a graphene electrode , the amount of electrical charge held in the key changes			0
this is then detected and redirected by the circuit to the speaker , creating the musical note			0
other conductive inks are made from precious metals such as silver , which makes them very expensive to produce and process , whereas graphene is both cheap , environmentally stable and does not require much processing after printing			1
this flexible piano is made from graphene - based inks , which have been printed onto a plastic film			1
the keys work as electrodes and are connected to a circuit - board , battery and speaker			0
when a person touches a graphene electrode , the amount of electrical charge held in the key changes and when it is detected it its redirected to the speaker to play a note the scientists believe graphene could be used in printed electronic devices such as heart monitors and other thin displays ( a prototype is pictured right )			1
the flexible material is similar to graphene ( pictured left ) and has a number of interesting properties , including flexibility , optical transparency , and electrical conductivity the scientists said graphene ink is superior to conductive polymers in terms of cost , stability and performance			1
the research team have also developed a flexible prototype digital display , which uses conventional printable materials , but with a transparent , electrically conductive graphene layer on top			2
the graphene layer is not only flexible but also more conductive and transparent than the conventional polymer it replaces			2
they believe the simple displays can be used in a wide range of smart packaging applications such as toys , labelling and board games			0
' both of these devices show how graphene could be printed on to a whole range of surfaces , which makes it ideal for printed electronics , ' dr @entity23 , the lead researcher behind the prototypes , said			1
' for example , it might eventually be possible to print electronics on to clothing and to make wearable patches to monitor people with health conditions , such as a heart problem , ' he added			0
another potential application of the technology could be cheap , printable sensors , which could be used to track luggage around an airport to ensure it is loaded on to the correct plane , or to follow products across a production and supply chain , the team said			2
each printed laser ( pictured ) can be designed to give out its own , unique optical signature , which its team of creators hope will prevent the sale of counterfeit goods a separate team of researchers at the @entity27 has created a detection device that uses printed lasers to identify counterfeit goods , which could help make products ranging from banknotes to designer handbags more resistant to fraud			1
dr @entity149 , who led the project , said the anti-fraud detector demonstrates an approach that could be employed to identify fake pharmaceuticals and currency , as well as high - value goods			0
it works by exploiting an existing method for printing liquid crystal lasers with inkjet printers , which gives the user a very precise level of control over the laser ’s pattern and colour combination			0
the detector takes advantage of this by shining a second , laser pulse onto the printed one			0
it then reads the wavelength of the light emission from the printed laser through a piece of dedicated software and reproduces that reading as a pattern on a spectrograph			0
lasers can be printed on to all sorts of surfaces , including plastic , paper , metal and glass , the technique could be used to authenticate a wide range of products			2
here a scientist demonstrates how the technology could be used to detect fake banknotes the result is that each printed laser can be designed to give out its own , unique optical signature			0
because lasers can be printed on to all sorts of surfaces , including plastic , paper , metal and glass , the technique could be used to authenticate a wide range of products			2
dr @entity149 said : ' every year , hundreds of thousands of people are sold fake pharmaceuticals under the mistaken belief that they will help them , while counterfeit products cost companies hundreds of billions of pounds			0
' ' we think that our printed lasers could be used to protect both products and people			0
' the prototypes were developed within the @entity27 ’s @entity212 and the teams are now working with partners in industry with a view to bringing them into commercial use .			2

scientists from the @entity27 's @entity26 created the keyboard from graphene - based electronic ink printed on a plastic film
they think graphene could be used in printed electronic devices such as heart monitors and other thin sensors
the new material is cheap , environmentally stable and does not require much processing after printing in *comparison* to other conductive inks
