by @entity0 last updated at 9:54 am on 20th december 2011 claim : @entity1 , who led the rebel assault on @entity3 , could be in line for a £ 1million payout a @entity7 rebel leader handed over by @entity8 for torture by @entity11 ’s henchmen yesterday launched legal action against @entity13			1
@entity1 – who this year helped @entity14 oust the tyrant by leading the military assault on @entity3 – could win £ 1million compensation from @entity13 taxpayers			1
he claims @entity13 helped snatch him on behalf of @entity11 ’s regime in 2004 , a few days before @entity20 embraced @entity11 in the notorious ‘ @entity21 ’			1
he says he suffered six years of abuse in the despot ’s brutal prisons , and during this time was interrogated by @entity13 spies including a female @entity8 agent			1
mr @entity1 , who was released from custody in 2010 , is now a key figure in the new @entity7 and many expect him to run for president			1
his wife , @entity32 , who was pregnant when she was seized with him , is also suing the @entity13			1
she was held for four months so could be in line for hundreds of thousands in compensation			0
lawyers acting for the couple served legal papers on the @entity38 yesterday , and insisted mr @entity1 was only suing the government because ministers had ignored his requests for a full apology over his ‘ barbaric ’ treatment			0
mr @entity1 , 45 , claims he was injected with truth drugs and left hanging by his wrists in a @entity3 cell as his interrogators beat him and demanded to know the whereabouts of @entity50			2
@entity52 sources have claimed a cabinet minister would almost certainly have had to approve @entity8 agents turning him over to @entity11 , although the foreign secretary at the time , @entity55 , has denied any knowledge of it			0
letter apparently implicating the government : the note congratulates @entity7 on the arrival of @entity62 - the other name @entity1 went by			1
the authenticity has not been confirmed mr @entity1 fled @entity7 as a dissident in the 1990s			2
he ended up @entity66 where he sought asylum through the @entity68			0
but @entity8 agents tipped off the @entity70 , and mr @entity1 and his wife were taken into custody as they changed planes in @entity74 , it is alleged			0
@entity77 officials then flew him to @entity7 , it is claimed			2
@entity78 , the couple ’s lawyer , said : ‘ the barbaric treatment which our clients describe , both at the hands of the @entity77 and the @entity7 , is beyond comprehension and yet it appears that the @entity13 was responsible for setting off this torturous chain of events			1
’ a @entity87 spokesman said : ‘ the government stands firmly against torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment			0
we do not condone it , nor do we ask others to do it on our behalf			0
’ close alliance : @entity20 meets @entity11 at his desert base in @entity3			0
the court case is likely to be embarrassing for the @entity13 government			2

@entity101 claims he was *detained* on his way to @entity13 and handed over to the @entity7
