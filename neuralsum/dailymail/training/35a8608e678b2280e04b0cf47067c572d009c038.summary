january is a month of reflection - and decisions			2
if your relationship finished in a decidedly messy state over @entity5 , the start of a @entity6 offers just the incentive you need to sort things out			2
stopping that affair , for instance			2
it 's one of few books written for people who are involved in affairs and do n't know what to do and that does n't beat them about the head with a stick			1
@entity18 identifies 17 different types of affairs in the book - which have inspired some of the reasons below			1
others are my own observations or based on other current research			2
if you 're having an affair and need to make some tough decisions this year , this should help clarify your motives and offer practical advice on what to do next			2
many of us have affairs to make up for something our relationship is lacking , this does n't have to be sex the reasons why most people have affairs : 1			1
to revive your sex life this affair 's not about being madly besotted with someone else , it 's done as a last bid attempt to wake up your partner sexually and romantically			1
they find out , they 're upset , devastated … but suddenly they appreciate you , sex is hot again			1
if this is you : most of these affairs die a natural death and some do achieve the desired result : the marriage can actually get better			1
of course in other cases , the attempt to heat things up ends up causing a fire that destroys the lot			2
to see if there 's something better out there comparison affairs are the most common female affair			1
you 're doing it because certain emotional and sexual needs are n't being met in your marriage			2
you compare your new lover to your husband to see if you 're missing out			2
if this is you : you did this for a reason , now make a decision			2
if you 're happier with the new person , leave			1
if you 're not , finish it and put your energy back into your marriage			0
to force you to leave @entity12 offers practical advice on whether now is the right time to leave your partner if you 'd secretly be relieved if your partner found out , you 're having an ' exit affair '			1
if this is you : leave - and do n't pretend to yourself or your lover that you 're leaving for them , you 're not			1
to ' support ' the marriage you 're happy with your marriage but bored or sexually unfulfilled : you have no desire to leave but need the excitement an affair provides			1
another circumstance : there 's some reason your partner ca n't have sex ( like illness ) or you do n't want to leave the marriage because of children or finances			1
these are called ' stabilising ' affairs or ' three - legged stools ' as with just two legs a stool would fall over , with three it 's stable			1
if this is you : this actually works for lots of people			1
but there 's a huge risk involved because the longer an affair lasts , the more likely you are to get found out			0
sometimes , particularly if the marriage has become more of a friendship , the affair is an unspoken agreement between couples			0
for revenge it could be payback for an affair they had , or they 're not paying you enough attention			0
if this is you : if it 's your only motive , you 've achieved your aim			0
stop it now – and do n't even think about telling your partner , no matter how sweet that revenge might be			0
you 're having a midlife crisis do i need to say more ? if this is you : skip the affair and talk with a friend , your partner or a counsellor about your fears of dreams slipping away , ageing or death – whatever it is you 're preoccupied with			0
to avoid facing the truth you know you should either leave or face your problems but instead you have a fling to distract yourself			1
if this is you : make a choice to leave or stay and work at it			1
you 're hurting everyone more by lingering in no - man 's land			0
to @entity170 you 've been a great husband / wife , mum / dad , you deserve it			0
lots of people indulge this one by having a ' safe ' one night encounter where the chances are getting found out are minimal			1
trouble is , it turns into two nights , then three , then ... if this is you : you 've had your ' treat ' , now stop it			0
your partner 's not meeting a certain need it might be sex you 're lacking or it might be affection , feeling taken for granted			1
if this is you : once you get the need met by a lover , you 'll know just how important it is to you			0
if it was n't that crucial , stop the affair			0
if it was ask your spouse to satisfy it			0
if they wo n't or ca n't , then leave			1
@entity12 says that if you fancy trading your partner in for a younger model you may what to rethink 10			1
to satisfy an @entity201 n't you 've never had a threesome / have a fetish or quirk you 'd like to act out but know your partner would be horrified			0
it seems safer to try it outside the marriage			0
if this is you : sometimes doing it once gets it out the way			0
other times , it reveals just how important it is			0
are you sure your partner ca n't provide what you crave ? if you intend to leave unless they do , you 've got nothing to lose by asking			1
to boost your ego you want to see if you can still pull			0
if this is you : if you do n't get found out and it 's a relatively short affair , the confidence boost can actually renew the relationship			0
that 's @entity18 's take on it			0
i say it 's a bloody risky way to boost your ego			0
would n't a new haircut and slinky dress do the job ? 12			0
you want to @entity230 you see it all the time when people become famous : the dutiful partner who helped them get there is rather rudely shoved aside for a sparkly young pert model			2
if this is you : they might be ' better ' in society 's eyes but plenty of people miss the ' old model ' more than they expect they would			2
