by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:10 am on 19th october 2011 the high - powered @entity3 lawyer hired by an anonymous donor to represent the parents of missing baby @entity6 gave an interview this morning , alongside the family 's private investigator , to tout the couple 's innocence in spite of recent claims that the mother may have been blackout drunk on the night of the 10 - month - old 's disappearance			1
federal aviation officials have also stepped into the search , by temporarily restricting flights that go over a wooded area near the @entity24 couple 's home , where authorities are now searching for the fourth time in hope of clues			1
the flight restrictions were announced tuesday and , according to @entity29 , they are in effect ' to provide a safe environment for law enforcement '			1
the restricted area is 1500 feet above and two nautical miles surrounding the wooded area			2
' we have been all over the city in the last 14 days following up on leads , interviewing people , furthering this investigation , and this is just another step in the investigation , ' said @entity37 spokesman @entity53			2
lawyer @entity54 said this morning that the fact that @entity57 's mother @entity6 has now changed the timeline of events from the disappearance should not be used as a reason to consider her a suspect			1
' it 's not an inconsistency , ' mr @entity54 said on @entity65 tuesday			0
' it may be a recollection refreshed at some later point , but it 's certainly not material to whether or not she had anything to do with the disappearance of her baby			2
' high - powered : parents @entity6 and @entity6 ( right ) have hired @entity54 ( left ) as their lawyer			2
@entity77 is best known for defending @entity78 , the @entity79 man suspected in the 2005 disappearance of @entity81 sure : @entity54 says he would not have taken the case if he had even the slightest hesitation that the parents were involved , and he said he spoke to them for a week before signing on to the case in previous reports , ms @entity87 had said that she put @entity57 to bed around 6.30pm and then checked on her around 10.30pm			2
on monday , mrs @entity87 changed that statement and said that she had not actually checked on her after putting her to bed			0
her lawyer , who has worked on controversial cases like that of @entity78 who was involved with the @entity81 disappearance case as well as this summer 's case against a @entity3 cop who was accused of raping a drunk woman , said that ms @entity87 's revelation is not a game changer			1
' there 's not a four hour gap , ' mr @entity54 urged			0
' at one point during one of the 13 hours of interview , she had said she believed she check on her at 10:30			0
' ms @entity87 's revelation comes amid complaints from police that the couple have refused to be questioned for the past ten days - meaning they stopped talking only five days after @entity57 disappeared on october 3			1
' the last time that the mom and dad sat down with detectives to answer questions about things they might only know was october 8			0
and that time , and previous times , there came a point when @entity123 became uncomfortable and stopped the questioning , ' said @entity126 police captain @entity125			2
caught on tape : @entity6 was caught on a store 's surveillance video buying a box of wine and baby supplies with her brother , five hours before @entity57 vanished blackout : @entity6 , pictured with @entity6 's father @entity6 , admits that she was drunk on a box of wine she bought before her daughter disappeared mr @entity54 criticized local @entity142 officials , saying ' some of the local police officers have conducted themselves in a way to me is baffling '			1
mr @entity54 was hired by an anonymous donor , who is keeping their identity secret in order to keep the focus on the case , who is the same man responsible for footing the bill of a private investigator			1
this is the same anonymous donor who has put up the $ 100,000 reward for finding baby @entity57 , and the donor is said to have a direct tie to the family , though that tie is going to remain unclear			1
@entity162 , the investigator , also spoke on @entity65 , echoing mr @entity54 's sentiments of the parent 's innocence			0
' we are starting to look outside the home , ' mr @entity162 said , making clear that they he and his team do not consider ms @entity87 or @entity57 's father @entity6 suspects			1
hopeful : investigator @entity162 thinks that given @entity57 's age , she is likely to still be alive and either be part of a trafficking scheme or be kidnapped where is she ? as the search for the baby who disappeared from @entity126 , @entity24 , continues a $ 100,000 reward was put up for her return or the conviction of anyone involved in her going missing in spite of the fact that there have been no new clues released and baby @entity57 has now been missing for over two weeks , mr @entity162 is still hopeful			1
' my feeling is that the baby is alive , someone has her			0
when you look at the statistics , no one 's taking a 10 - month - old to do harm ; they 're taking i would say either for trafficking or to have their own [ child ]			0
' ms @entity87 and mr @entity43 , who are engaged , have told authorities that he arrived home from a night shift to find the front door unlocked , the house lights on , a window tampered with and the baby gone			0
ms @entity87 said police accused her of killing @entity57 and that she believes she will be arrested			2
' i was the last one with her , ' she said			0
' that 's kind of a fear that i have			0
' @entity6 : @entity6 said that she put her daughter in her crib at 6.30pm on october 4 she said is scared that her arrest would precipitate an end to the search for her missing baby			0
' if they arrest me , people are going to stop looking for her and i 'll never know what happened , ' @entity87 said			0
she also said her two sons , aged 6 and 8 , who were asleep elsewhere in the home at the time of @entity57 's disappearance , say they heard noises the night @entity57 disappeared although she does n't know if they heard noises before they went to sleep or later in the night and she does n't want them to be involved in the investigation			1
' i have not sat down and talked to them about it , specifically to not have to put them through anything else , ' she said			0
