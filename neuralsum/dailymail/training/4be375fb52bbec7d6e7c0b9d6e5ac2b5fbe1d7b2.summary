by @entity0 published : 21:18 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 21:32 est , 19 november 2012 it is the scandal that has shaken the community of @entity3 , @entity4 , to its core			1
one month since @entity7 was charged with running a brothel from her @entity10 studio in the genteel @entity13 town , local police continue to work through her client list and the revelations keep on coming			1
once known primarily for its pristine beaches and proximity to the @entity22 family 's summer residence in @entity23 , the scandal has rocked the @entity13 town to its very foundations in more ways than one			1
notable among them is @entity47 , 59 , owner and founder of @entity49 , a company that boasts of being ' number one @entity50 for over 20 years , ' and advertises itself online as ' a @entity52			1
' indeed mr @entity47 is such a staunch advocate of conservative family values			1
according to state records , he donated $ 1000 to @entity55 and organisation set up to ' defend ' marriage in the state from the perceived onslaught from ' gay rights activists ' and ' radical judges ' seeking to ' redefine marriage '			0
he also made a donation of $ 350 to senator @entity64 a conservative opponent of the state 's same - sex marriage ballot			0
@entity4 's ' @entity70 home builder , ' and family values advocate , @entity47 , 59 , has been charged by police invested in the community : attorney @entity73 , former portland planning board member and @entity75 coach has also been implicated similarly vocal in his defence of family values is attorney @entity78 , identified by @entity79 as one of the men charged with ' engaging a prostitute , ' and a @entity84 based lawyer			1
mr @entity73 , 49 , served on the @entity85 from 2008 until summer 2012			1
in his professional biography he makes great play of his commitment to the community and to his family who are , he says , ' firmly settled in @entity84 '			2
he goes on : ' i can honestly say that of all the wonderful places i 've had the chance to live in , @entity84 , me is exactly where i want to be			0
' i 'm heavily invested in the community i served on the @entity97 from 2000 - 2005			0
i also served on the @entity85 from 2008 until summer , 2012			2
' he has coached and umpired for the local little league and volunteered in local schools			0
when approached by @entity101 mr @entity73 declined to comment			0
speaking to @entity84 's @entity102 , @entity103 , a sociologist at @entity105 and expert on prostitution said that the fact that a large number of @entity7 's alleged clients were in such related or similar businesses , ' does suggest that there was some referring going on			1
' though truth be told it hardly takes an expert to draw such a conclusion			0
@entity7 is said to have kept meticulous notes , a ' @entity118 ' and stands accused of having filmed clients in her @entity10 studio and rented office former mayor , @entity124 , 58 , a married father of four with ' lots of explaining to do ' to his wife attorney @entity127 , 54 , a ' happy guy who loves his wife and children ' financier @entity130 , 63 , who lives in a $ 500,000 waterfront @entity13 home @entity133 , 57 , a realtor with a string of wealthy clients in search for real estate and timberland @entity7 kept meticulous records suggesting a business enterprise that brought in more than $ 150,000 in 18months and including a ' @entity118 , ' and client list reportedly running to 150 ' johns			1
' this , along with other materials removed from her @entity10 studio has formed the basis for much of the @entity79 investigation			0
an honours student who raised money for good causes , none suspected @entity7 of living a double life speaking to mail online lieutenant @entity154 admitted that they were a long way from completeing their enquiries			2
he said : ' we 've been investigating since september 2011 and we 're nowehere near finished			0
' we have to establish probably cause before we can charge these men and we 're working through a long list			2
' the investigation was sparked by a tip off from a ' concerned resident ' who had grown suspicious of the frequent male visitors to @entity7 's dance studio and , later , a rented office across the street			1
but nobody could possibly have imagined the torrent of allegation and counter-allegation that would follow			0
to most of those who knew her to that point @entity7 was simply ' a fun and energetic ' girl , a former honours student from neighbouring @entity181 who took part in charity drives and class trips with her 7 - year - old son			2
she hosted @entity10 charity events for earthquake victims in @entity188 , the @entity190 foundation for breast cancer and @entity192			0
these are the sort of our - of - hours activities residents of the light - house studded coastline expect of their neighbours			0
but if the charges against are prove true she did all this while leading a double life that included acts of prostitution and filming clients			0
so far police have released three batches of names of men charged with engaging a prostitute			2
as well as the peculiar prevalence of contractors , painters , drywall and concrete specialists , window and flooring professionals , realtors , appraisers and real estate attorneys the list has included former mayor @entity223 , 58 , realtor @entity133 , 57 , attorney @entity127 , 54 , financier @entity130 , 63 and local ice hockey coach , @entity224 who has since stepped down from his role at @entity226			2
all of the accused men sought to prevent their names being made a matter of public record in an application that was last month denied in @entity232 by justice @entity233			2
picture perfect : @entity3 had long been known simply for its white beaches , light - house studded coastline , lobster and proximity to the @entity22 family 's summer home they are not the only men seeking to distance themselves from @entity244 , the @entity10 instrutcor who allegedly employed a number of online aliases to advertise her willingness to ' have fun ( @entity250 ) with both men and women '			1
the lawyer acting for @entity36 , 57 , @entity7 's former business partner and alleged co-conspirator , has applied to have @entity36 's case heard separately from the dance instructor			1
according to @entity36 's lawyer , @entity258 , this is because @entity7 faces far more serious felony charges than @entity36 who has been charged with 59 misdemeanours - all of which he denies			1
she has been charged on 106 counts of prositution , invasion of privacy , conspiracy , tax offences and receving welfare benefits when ineligible for welfare			0
mr @entity258 said , ' it is guilt by association and we woudl just as soon go this month on our own , by ourselves			0
' mr @entity258 is also hoping that his client 's trial can be heard before @entity276 - an impossiblity for @entity7 as the police continue to issue summonses , and release names , pushing the trial well into next year .			1

@entity7 's business partner and *co-accused* complains of ' guilt by association '
