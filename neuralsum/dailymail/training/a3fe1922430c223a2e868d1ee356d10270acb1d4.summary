the ‘ close protection security guard ’ , who worked for the late singer @entity49 , was awarded £ 108,491 in aggravated damages for his ‘ handicap on the labour market ’ and what was called the high - handed and oppressive manner of police			1

judge @entity9 said the officers , named as @entity61 and @entity62 , saw the pair on the street at 10.30am on @entity65			0

mr @entity3 ( right , with @entity68 co-star @entity67 ) and mr @entity7 were stopped by police as they made their way home from an all - night party			1
the comedian admitted that he was drunk and had n't slept the officers ‘ were immediately aware of mr @entity3 ’s celebrity status ’ , she said , and knew the area as a ‘ drugs hotspot ’			1
@entity3 was wearing his stage outfit from a show the night before , including dungarees , gold boots , a ladies ’ checked jacket , and dyed blond hair			1
the judge said that while @entity25 , 54 , was not @entity3 ’s minder , his job meant he ‘ was in the habit of looking out for people such as @entity3 who might be the subject of unwelcome attention ’			2
the men were ‘ well known to one another ’			0
after the party , @entity25 had been asked to clear up drugs paraphernalia			0

@entity61 claimed he shouted to @entity25 to stop			0
he said @entity25 struggled and tried to conceal something in his hand , so he put him in an arm lock and carried him out of the shop			0
mr @entity3 ( pictured in the @entity68 ) said he was aware of a struggle between mr @entity7 and the officers , but he did not see any violence , @entity23 's @entity20 heard mr @entity7 was previously a very fit man whose hobbies included fencing , skydiving and running , @entity23 's @entity20 ( pictured ) heard			1
but he was left with a leg injury and now sometimes has to use a wheelchair but @entity25 claimed he was attacked from behind without warning			2
the judge said neither was ‘ entirely honest ’ , but the officer deliberately exaggerated			0
he was ‘ not telling the truth ’ and showed ‘ deliberate dishonesty ’ in his account of what happened when an ambulance arrived			0
@entity25 ’s leg was smashed and he spent a month in hospital			0
his leg became infected , and he later suffered another broken leg and a broken arm when he fell badly during recovery			2
the judge found @entity3 , who was ‘ an honest and straightforward witness ’ was ‘ unnecessarily restrained ’ by being ‘ manhandled to the floor and handcuffed without being told why ’			1
she said @entity25 ’s previous convictions were ‘ of very limited relevance ’ , but added he had no tax returns or bank accounts and ‘ seems to have no work history ’			0
@entity139 footage from the store – which the @entity20 judge said was ‘ likely to be of the utmost importance ’ – was damaged beyond use as it was transported between the offices of the @entity146 ’s solicitors .			0

mr @entity148 was *forcibly* removed from @entity23 shop before being restrained
