by @entity0 published : 14:56 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 06:12 est , 14 january 2013 sir @entity1 could be awarded a posthumous knighthood – so he can then be stripped of it			1
the bizarre plan is being considered by the @entity5 because knighthoods can not be removed from people who have died			1
those given a knighthood are awarded lifetime membership to a ‘ living order ’ and the title no longer exists when the holder dies			1
a constitutional bar preventing the dead from having their knighthoods removed means the government 's forfeiture committee can not strip @entity20 of the accolade a @entity23 source told @entity24 : ' the forfeiture committee is certainly looking at the issue			2
' the tv host , who died last year aged 84 , was knighted in the @entity28 in 1990 - an award which followed the obe he was given for services to charity and broadcasting in 1971			1
the @entity34 has the power to remove honours after they have been recommended by the forfeiture committee			2
last year @entity38 , former chief executive of @entity39 , was stripped of his knighthood			1
paedophile : @entity1 who was awarded a knighthood in 1990 for ' charitable services ' a report published this week by @entity45 and @entity46 said he @entity47 spent ‘ every waking minute ’ thinking about abusing children and used his celebrity status to that end			1
eighteen girls and ten boys aged under ten were abused – the youngest being a boy of eight targeted at his school			2
allegations of sexual assault have been made by 450 individuals , aged up to 47 , and some have yet to be interviewed			0
the 214 confirmed offences included 34 rapes and stretch across 28 police force areas			0
the most recent was in 2009 but they date back as far as 1955			0
lawyers for the victims have already instigated compensation claims against the @entity67 , @entity68 and education authorities for failing to stop the serial predator			0
the payouts could run into millions of pounds			0
@entity72 said it was shocking it had taken so long to expose the @entity47 ’s predatory behaviour			0
they said senior managers who missed opportunities to stop him should be named and shamed .			0

an obe or knighthood expires when a person dies but title ' sir ' is still used
@entity5 may award @entity1 another knighthood so he can be stripped of it publicly
