it 's the call centre accused of plaguing @entity1 with an incredible six million calls a day			1
now @entity3 can reveal the chequered background of the man responsible – involving disputes with famous names and a string of failed businesses			0
@entity10 is the main shareholder in a company that is currently under investigation for bombarding its victims , including the elderly and vulnerable , with unsolicited nuisance calls selling debt management and payment protection insurance ( @entity19 ) claims services			1
earlier this month the cold - call ' factory ' based at an anonymous business complex in @entity23 , @entity24 , was raided by the @entity25 , which is responsible for the enforcement of the @entity27			1
@entity10 is the main shareholder in a company that is currently under investigation for bombarding its victims , including the elderly and vulnerable , with unsolicited nuisance calls the firm is reported to hold a staggering 90 million phone numbers that it repeatedly calls using sophisticated technology			1
mr @entity10 has a decidedly questionable past that includes : mr @entity10 began his career as an entrepreneur in the mid- 1980s in @entity38 , where he lived until recently with his wife in a £ 1.6 million property			0
the 54 - year - old has been the director of 19 companies , mostly relating to the publishing industry			2
but official records show that 18 of these firms have been dissolved , owing £ 3.4 million to creditors			1
in 2009 mr @entity10 was banned by the @entity47 for four years from setting up another business after it was discovered that four of his firms had failed to pay taxes and national insurance payments totalling £ 120,000			1
nuisance : @entity53 took legal action against @entity55 @entity10 was the target of @entity53 's fury over a comic strip			1
ms @entity53 , left , and her then husband @entity59 brought legal action against @entity55 's company , @entity61 , following a cartoon in @entity63			1
it imagined an affair between ms @entity53 and football legend @entity66 that resulted in a baby resembling @entity68 – the infant was shown in a cot			2
the tv star took offence because it came out shortly after the tragic cot death of her four - month - old son @entity74			1
mr @entity10 's lawyer , @entity75 , said the cartoon went to press before the death of ms @entity53 's child , adding : ' the timing was therefore most unfortunate and entirely unintended by the editor			2
the action was settled on that basis and for the sake of expediency			0
' a spokesman for @entity55 said : ' he was left mortified over the situation			0
' the complaint was settled , and that decision was the correct course of action			0
' a representative for ms @entity53 confirmed that action was brought against the magazine			2
mr @entity10 has also been the subject of a number of legal actions involving high - profile names			2
the first of these lawsuits was brought by ms @entity53 and her then husband , tv executive @entity59 , in 1991 over what they believed to be an offensive cartoon published in a magazine owned by mr @entity10			1
in 1996 , he landed in hot water again when his company @entity105 brought out @entity107 's official magazine			2
the pop band 's management said they planned to sue the firm when the magazine folded after one issue , leaving angry teenage fans who had paid a £ 30 subscription fee out of pocket			1
at the time , the band 's manager , @entity116 , said : ' we are disgusted with celebrity publications and their disregard for @entity107 fans			1
the whole matter is in the hands of our lawyers			0
celebrity publications were recommended to us because they also handled the official @entity127 magazine			0
' mr @entity10 caused more controversy when he launched a monthly ' lads ' mag ' in 2004 called @entity131 that offered advice on shoplifting and taking ecstasy			0
but this also proved to be a doomed venture and folded after four editions , owing thousands of pounds and unpaid wages to staff			1
despite his financial troubles , mr @entity10 is now the majority owner of a call centre that the @entity25 says has cornered a sizeable proportion of the cold - call market			1
@entity144 , from the information regulator , said			0
' it is astounding to think that this one small company has the ability to pester millions of people with unwanted calls on a huge scale			2
' the firm is based at the @entity152 in @entity23 and shares its address and directors with several other cold - call companies			1
for legal reasons , the company being investigated can not be named			0
the @entity25 launched an investigation into the centre after receiving reports that its staff had been phoning people who had asked not to receive unsolicited sales or marketing calls			2
the watchdog suspects the firm used automatic dialling technology to make up to six million nuisance calls a day			2
these calls resulted in ' millions upon millions ' of anonymous messages being left on people 's home phones and mobiles with offers about debt management and @entity19 claims services			1
the @entity25 said the company invited victims to press 9 to speak to a call handler regarding a @entity19 claim , or 5 to stop the calls			1
but investigators for the watchdog said there was evidence that those who pressed 5 continued to be harassed			0
mr @entity144 added : ' i have never seen an operation of this size			0
those targeted will have included the elderly or people vulnerable for other reasons			0
we received a vast number of complaints from hundreds of people who were frightened by these calls			0
' the @entity25 confiscated paperwork and computer equipment during its raid on march 12 and is considering what further action to take			0
@entity55 once took thousands of pounds in subscription fees from teenage @entity107 ( pictured , file photo ) fans for a magazine that folded after one issue last night , @entity210 mp @entity209 , who is a member of the @entity211 on nuisance calls , called for firms to be ' named and shamed			1
' she said : ' you will then find out who is behind them and the chances are that anyone who 's prepared to make nuisance calls is probably playing fast and loose with the law elsewhere			0
' we also need to be taking action against those companies using nuisance calls to generate business			2
' mr @entity10 's lawyer , @entity75 , insisted there had been ' no formal allegation , charge or complaint ' received by his client or any companies associated with him			0
he said neither mr @entity10 nor his companies had ' received any notification as to any investigation by the @entity25 or any other regulatory authority '			2
the raid comes ahead of the introduction of new powers on april 6 that will make it easier for the @entity25 to fine rogue cold - call companies up to £ 500,000			1
recent figures show that 30 million @entity1 receive up to a billion nuisance phone calls and text messages every year			2
the new powers due to come into force follow a sustained campaign by the @entity25 to make it easier to fine companies found to be making nuisance calls			1
the @entity25 has struggled to punish rogue firms because of the requirement to prove the business had caused ' substantial damage or distress '			2
but now the regulator simply has to demonstrate a firm has been a significant nuisance to apply fines of up to £ 500,000			0
an @entity25 spokesman said : ' this law change is a game - changer			2
the @entity3 has exposed firms using cold calls in the past			1
in 2013 , our undercover investigation revealed how one company , @entity269 , had phoned thousands of people to persuade them to release money from their pensions without warning of the risk of large losses			0
by @entity276 nuisance calls are being taken to new levels of absurdity by firms that telephone the public uninvited – to offer services to stop cold calls			1
but what many people do not realise is that a safeguard against cold calls is already available for free through the government - backed @entity287 ( @entity289 )			1
two firms offering to block cold calls have recently been placed on a monitoring list of the @entity25 ( @entity25 )			1
the list features the 20 ' worst ' culprits based on the number of complaints and information from consumer organisations			0
@entity299 's director is @entity300 ( pictured ) , 31 , who is pictured on @entity301 enjoying holidays in @entity303 and @entity304 , cold call elimination has been warned it is on the regulator 's radar amid allegations that staff gave the impression they were calling from @entity313 to offer a government - backed scheme			1
the firm offers services priced between £ 34.99 and £ 129.99 that include fitting a ' call - blocker ' device to landlines to stopping unwanted calls from @entity1 and foreign numbers			1
however , anyone can register for free with the @entity289			0
firms making calls without prior consent to people signed up to the @entity289 are breaking the law			0
@entity299 's director is @entity300 , 31 , who is pictured on @entity301 enjoying holidays in @entity303 and @entity304 , and drinking from a bottle of champagne			0
the company denies any wrongdoing and says it follows all @entity334 practices			0
it is not under investigation but is being ' monitored ' by the @entity25 , which could order a full probe if it suspects illegal practices or non-compliance with cold - calling regulations			1
the firm denies its staff have alluded to being from @entity313 or offering a government service			1
it says it gets numbers from companies that sell data but intends only to contact people who have ' opted in '			0
@entity349 is also on the @entity25 monitoring list			0
it did not respond to repeated requests for comment			0
double - glazing firm @entity353 has also been placed on the @entity25 list			1
the company is owned by @entity356 , whose chief executive is @entity359 , co-owner of @entity360 rugby side @entity360			0
a legal spokesman for mr @entity359 denied @entity353 has had a ' significant number of caller complaints ' or had ' acted in breach of the relevant regulations '			0
he added that mr @entity359 had no operational involvement in @entity353 .			0
