by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent the @entity3 should let women soldiers take career breaks to raise families and consider allowing them to fight on the front line , the chief of the general staff said yesterday			1
female soldiers should be allowed to enter front - line combat , sir @entity10 , chief of the general staff said yesterday general sir @entity10 said that terms of service should be flexible to allow ‘ individuals to dip in and out of @entity3 careers ’			1
the @entity3 ’s most senior officer also opened the prospect that the @entity3 may ease its last restrictions on women taking their place in front - line fighting			1
women remain excluded from the infantry and from tank crews			0
he said he wanted to show women that the army was ‘ open ’ and an equal opportunities employer			0
a review of the role of women in combat is due before 2018 , and comes at a time when other @entity33 armies are moving to allow women soldiers into all roles			1
@entity36 will open all units to women at the beginning of 2016 , and the @entity40 last year removed its official ban on women in combat roles			1
on allowing more flexible terms of service sir @entity10 said : ‘ that would be particularly important for females who want to take a break to have families , ’ he said			1
‘ we ’re not very good at making it easy for talented women who want to have a family and sustain a service career			1
if we were better at that we ’d have a better @entity3			2
’ sir @entity10 remained guarded about the possibility of women in hand - to - hand fighting but said in an interview with the @entity3 ’s soldier magazine : ‘ we are in a minority of armies now in that respect			1
‘ it ’s definitely something that we need to be considering seriously but we need to go about this with great care , especially with all the other changes going on			0
‘ this is n’t just about getting more females into the 30 per cent of roles that are combat trades but getting more of them into the @entity3			1
’ the suggestion of the introduction of career breaks , so that young women who train as soldiers can take a few years off and then return as their children get older , comes at a time when the military are under severe pressure to build up a reserve army			2
sir @entity10 said : ' we 're not very good at making it easy for talented women who want to have a family and sustain a service career			1
if we were better at that we 'd have a better army ' troop numbers are to be cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 , with the shortfall to be made up by the recruitment of 35,000 reservists			0
last week a senior general , sir @entity90 , described the scheme as ‘ a hell of a risk ’			0
a flexible working contract for women soldiers could both boost recruitment by bringing mothers back into the ranks after a few years raising children , and help maintain a trained reserve of women with families			1
such a reserve force would , however , risk controversy if mothers with young families were called up in a crisis			0
the idea comes at a time when mothers of young are routinely expected to work in civilian life and @entity112 policies are bent on providing cheap childcare to encourage them to do so			0
sir @entity10 , pictured here with defence secretary @entity117 , said : ' this is n't just about getting more females into the 30 per cent of roles that are combat trades but getting more of them into the @entity3 ' sir @entity10 said : ‘ our engagement with @entity125 society is important in making sure the service is supported by the public and well manned			1
he added that the withdrawal of @entity125 troops from @entity130 , due for completion next year , will be conducted in a family - friendly manner			2
soldiers , he said , ‘ if they are married , rely on more than one income to achieve the lifestyle they want			0
it ’s difficult to do that if you are moving back and forth to @entity130 on a regular basis			0
‘ the military covenant will give our families more surety about plugging into local health and education services in @entity125 communities and all this adds up to more stability for our personnel			0
’ the @entity3 currently has 7,500 women soldiers , who serve with the artillery and engineers in front - line roles sir @entity10 said of the @entity3 strength reductions : ‘ those were , essentially , economic choices made by the government			1
we are not doing this because the threats to @entity125 interests around the world are diminishing			0
‘ we ’ve got to be absolutely honest about our capability and the army 2020 structure delivers most of what we can currently do , albeit with slightly less resilience			0
’ the @entity3 currently has 7,500 women soldiers , who serve with the artillery and engineers in front - line roles			1
women fly as fighter pilots as well as taking more traditional female duties as medics and intelligence officers			2
in the @entity179 , the first women who will be allowed to serve as submariners are now in training			0
sir @entity10 said : ‘ we have always said that we will look at the evidence and base our decision on what impact it will have on operational capability			1
‘ women need to see they have equal opportunities right throughout the organisation			0
allowing them to be combat troops would make us look more normal to society but there will always be people who say the close battle is no place for female soldiers			1
’ opponents of women in combat roles make two central objections			2
the first is that the physical strength of women is insufficient for hand - to - hand fighting of the kind occasionally demanded of infantry in @entity205 and @entity206			2
the second is that in combat male soldiers would be likely to try to protect or help wounded women comrades , distracting them from their main job of trying to kill the enemy			1
@entity36 : roles formerly closed to women , in infantry , special forces and artillery , will be open to both sexes from 2016			1
however , as of last year , only 20 of the 8,000 women in the country ’s defence forces had asked to transfer to combat units			2
@entity223 : all duties have been open to women for 25 years and two per cent of combat troops are female			1
women have served on submarines since 2000 and the first woman commander of a warship was appointed in 2003			0
@entity231 : equality in the military has been law since 2001 , when women were admitted to the infantry , and armour and artillery units			0
however , a @entity125 report on the results found ‘ variable success in attracting and recruiting women to these areas ’			0
@entity40 : announced last year that the ban on women in combat is going			1
however , no woman has yet been admitted to the @entity248 or special forces			0
@entity250 : all service branches open to women since 1988 following a decision that women are capable of close fighting			2
however , physical strength requirements have prevented women from joining special forces			0
@entity259 : all jobs open to women except submarines and riot police			0
however , although 20 per cent of armed forces personnel are women , only 1.7 per cent of the infantry is female			2
@entity267 : infantry and combat roles open to women since 1985			2
over the last decade women have been recruited to artillery , anti-aircraft and rescue jobs			0
however , while all women must carry out military service , they are required to join for only two years , against three for men .			2

sir @entity10 said terms of service should allow soldiers to ' dip in and out '
@entity3 ' not very good ' at making it easy for women to have families
review of women in combat due by 2018 - @entity287 has 7,500 female soldiers
