the air on @entity1 was a toxic soup of chemicals for almost two billion years as life was evolving on the planet , according to new research			1
scientists have found the oldest evidence for what our planet 's atmosphere was like 4 billion years ago , just 600 million years after the @entity1 first took shape			1
by analysing the different levels of isotopes trapped inside some of the oldest rocks in the world , they were able to build up a picture of what the air was like at the time			2
researchers studied chemicals from the early atmosphere trapped in rocks in @entity26 , @entity27 ( above ) they found that the @entity1 's early atmosphere contained oxygen levels that were far lower than they were today and were even lower than scientists had previously believed			1
the study also suggests that the atmosphere may have contained considerably more sulphur dioxide , more methane gas and carbon dioxide than it does today			1
the @entity1 's atmospehre was almost entirely oxygen free when it first formed			0
it took billions of years before there was enough of this gas around to support oxygen - breathing life			0
geological evidence suggests that around 2.6 billion years ago there was a dramatic shift in the composition of the @entity1 's atmosphere as the amount of oxygen it contained rocketed			1
experts believe that around 3 billion years ago a new type of microbe appeared on the @entity1 that had not been there before			2
these bacteria were capable of harnessing the sun 's energy to power chemical reactions known as photosynthesis			1
this allowed them to use carbon dioxide and water to grow and they gave off oxygen as a waste material			2
as these hugely successful bacteria spread , oxygen levels began to rise			2
indeed it is thought that oxygen became so abundant that many of these early bacteria died off , poisoned by its presence as other forms of oxygen breathing life evolved to take their place			2
the composition is almost identical the chemical fingerprints found in rocks that formed around 2 - 3 billion years ago			1
the results suggest that the atmosphere of our planet remained almost unchanged as the first bacteria began to appear and these may have controlled the atmosphere			0
it could provide new clues as to what the first life was like on @entity1 and how it evolved			0
dr @entity89 , a geologist at @entity90 who oversaw the research , said : ' those younger rocks contain clear signs of microbial life			0
' one interpretation is that biology controlled the composition of the atmosphere on early @entity1 , with similar microbial biospheres producing the same atmospheric gases from @entity1 ’s infancy to adolescence			0
' we ca n’t rule out , however , the possibility that the biosphere was decoupled from the atmosphere			0
' in this case geology could have been the major player in setting the composition of ancient air , with massive volcanic eruptions producing gases that recurrently swamped out weak biological gas production			0
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity117 , analysed rocks from an area known as the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity26 , northern @entity27 , @entity122			2
using mass spectrometery they were able to measure the levels of sulphur isotopes trapped inside the rocks when they were created			1
the @entity120 is thought to be between 3.7 billion and 4.2 billion years old			0
the @entity1 is thought to have formed around 4.6 billion years ago and the first signs of life is thought to have appeared around 4 billion years ago			1
sulphur isotopes in the crystals of the rock in the @entity132 ( above ) allowed the scientists to analyse what the @entity1 's atmosphere was like when the rock was forming around 4 billion years ago @entity121 ( above ) , which sits within @entity26 , @entity27 , is home to some of the oldest rocks in the world the result suggested that oxygen levels were just 20 per cent of the levels today , making up just 0.0002 per cent of the atmosphere			1
this is far lower than previous estimates , which have said said oxygen made up around 0.01 per cent of the atmosphere			0
@entity148 currently makes up about 21 per cent of the gases in the atmosphere			0
previous work by the researchers also looked at the composition of rocks that were between 2 to 3 billion years old , showed they had similar levels of sulphur			1
many palaeobiologists believe that the first life to appear on @entity1 were bacteria capable of living in the harsh environments that existed around 4 billion years ago			1
they would have been similar to the ' extremophile ' bacteria that are found living around volcanic vents and acidic hot springs today			0
ancient archaebacteria similar to this @entity165 , which can grow in temperatures of 70 degrees @entity167 and acid with @entity169 , would have been able to survive the harsh conditions in the early @entity1 it is thought that as these bacteria evolved , they became able to photosynthesis and began producing oxygen around 2.6 billion years ago			1
this then led to a fundamental change in the atmosphere , allowing the life that needs oxygen to live to develop			0
dr @entity181 , a geologist led the research and now works at the @entity184 ( @entity185 ) in @entity186 , said : ' we found that the isotopic fingerprint of this atmospheric cycling looks just like similar fingerprints from rocks that are a billion to 2 billion years younger			2
' this unusual atmospheric fingerprint has been present since the end of the @entity194 , the earliest eon of @entity1 history			0

geologists at @entity90 studied sulphur isotopes trapped in rocks
they looked at ancient rocks found around @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity122
the air would have contained 20 *%* of the oxygen it does at the moment
but would have been more sulphur dioxide , methane and carbon dioxide
the atmosphere would have been *lethal* to humans and most forms of life
early life that developed 4 billion years ago would not have needed oxygen
bacteria capable of harnessing the sun 's energy in photosynthesis are thought to have *increased* the oxygen levels around 2.6 billion years ago
