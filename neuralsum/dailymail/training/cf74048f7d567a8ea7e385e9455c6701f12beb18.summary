by @entity0 published : 03:19 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 04:42 est , 24 october 2012 a town centre shop is putting good manners above its own profits after telling customers ' if you 're on your phone , you wo n't be served			1
' @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , have taken the bold step of banning people from the front of the queue if they are nattering on their mobile			1
a notice pinned up in the shop says staff will ignore them and serve the next person instead			2
phone @entity21 : staff at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , have said enough is enough and refused to serve anyone on their mobile ( posed by model ) the ban was the idea of counter assistants @entity29 and @entity30 , who were fed up with having to wait for customers to hang up			1
' quite simply , if someone 's on their phone we 'll serve the next person , ' @entity29 said			0
' people refusing to hang up when it 's their turn to be served is happening increasingly , and as we 're selling @entity40 tickets the queue can get quite long			0
' we had some people coming up to us on the phone , not paying attention to what we were asking them and holding up the queue			0
' @entity29 said the policy had generally been well received , but she has heard the odd grumble and one young customer stormed out shouting ' stuff you '			2
stuff you ! one customer stormed out shouting when refused service at the store in @entity8 ( pictured ) , but the majority of people have been supportive , staff say she said ' we 've had plenty of positive comments , and the majority of customers on their phone apologise and stop the call			1
' people say it 's a good idea because it 's rude being on your phone and holding up the queue			0
' @entity7 owner @entity70 backs the rule , saying ' it 's disrespectful to be on the phone when you want to get served , and the counter assistants should n't have to put up with it			0

@entity7 in @entity8 will not sell anything to anyone making a call
staff think it is *bad* manners so have pinned up signs in the shop
' we 've had plenty of positive comments , and the majority of customers on their phone apologise and stop the call , ' a *worker* says
one person on the phone stormed out shouting ' stuff you '
