@entity2 ’s @entity1 play - off hopes were dealt a body blow after they crashed to a first home defeat under coach @entity5			2
the @entity6 never recovered from a dismal first half after which they trailed a rampant @entity8 32 - 0 and , although they produced a spirited revival , a 36 - 18 defeat leaves them four points behind eighth - placed @entity12 with four games left of the regular season			0
@entity8 , with former @entity16 hooker @entity15 in impressive form on his return from a two - month injury lay - off , were dominant from the start , despite the late withdrawal of winger @entity22 and prop @entity23			1
easy pickings : the impressive @entity25 ( centre ) celebrates after scoring in the easy win at @entity2 @entity5 was also forced to make a late change , switching @entity29 from stand - off to full - back in the absence of the injured @entity33 , and the @entity34 experienced mixed fortunes in his new role			0
he conceded a penalty from the kick - off by putting the ball straight into touch and the visitors scored inside their first set , with half - backs @entity43 and @entity44 working the ball out wide for centre @entity46 to touch down for the first of their six tries before the break			1
@entity44 disputed referee @entity53 ’s decision to disallow his conversion , after the two touchjudges came to different conclusions over the accuracy of the kick , but it hardly mattered as @entity8 went on to win at a canter			0
@entity15 made his first impact on nine minutes when his short pass got prop @entity62 charging over for the @entity63 ’ second try and it was all @entity8 as winger @entity65 was denied by @entity66 ’ last - ditch tackle and front rower @entity68 was held up over the line			1
there was no respite for the @entity6 when @entity68 went off as a barnstorming run from his replacement @entity75 created the position for @entity15 to force his way over from dummy half before taking @entity15 ’s pass to cross himself			1
@entity15 went off for a well - earned breather on 28 minutes and his replacement , teenager @entity82 , was quickly into the action , taking @entity43 ’s pass to score his first try of the season after @entity29 had dropped @entity44 ’s high kick			1
@entity2 spent virtually the whole of the first 40 minutes inside their own half and , on a rare foray near the visitors ’ line , spilled ball and watched @entity65 sprint 95 metres for an opportunist 18th try of the season			1
leading 32 - 0 at the break , it was always going to be difficult for the @entity63 to maintain their sparkling form and the @entity6 , boosted by the arrival from the bench of forwards @entity103 and @entity104 , enjoyed a good deal more possession to enable them to redeem themselves			0
@entity29 scored one try four minutes into the second half , which he converted , looked to have added another only to be pulled back for a forward pass and was then held up over the line			2
wildcats ’ pressure eventually told when hooker @entity114 got stand - off @entity66 through a yawning gap in the @entity8 defence and @entity29 kicked his second goal			2
it was a far more even contest in the second half , with the @entity63 scoring their only other try through teenager @entity119 , who switched from the wing to full - back in the absence of @entity123 for the second half			0
the @entity6 were well beaten but they had the final say when second rower @entity125 got out an offload that enabled @entity29 to score his second try and he also kicked his third goal .			0

former @entity16 hooker @entity15 had been out for two months
@entity46 scored the opening try for the visitors
