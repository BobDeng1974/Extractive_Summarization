it was always going to take more than a dotted white line to curb @entity3 ’s enthusiasm			1
it was always going to take more than touchline rules and a red card in his first game to wipe the smile from his face			0
a debut win will do that for a manager , especially this one who came south to seek his fortune and found a lot of closed doors until he reached the bottom of the @entity20			1
there were times during @entity3 ’s six - month hunt for a job when the courtesy of a returned call could not even be taken for granted			1
@entity27 manager @entity3 leaves his technical area to congratulate @entity29 after his goal @entity3 ( right ) has accused fourth official @entity31 ( left ) of being ' a bit pedantic ' after he was sent off the new @entity27 boss ' first game in charge saw them lift off the bottom of the @entity20 table his desire to work had reached the point where he was going public with his interest in certain vacancies , namely those at @entity46 and @entity47			1
yet the inexplicable truth is that a manager who beat @entity50 on a budget with @entity52 was not getting much of a sniff in @entity54			1
a source close to the @entity56 told @entity57 recently that one of the second - tier clubs approached by @entity3 ’s representative had failed to respond to half a dozen messages			1
but @entity3 is nothing if not a scrapper			1
to @entity27 he went and on saturday , with a win at @entity65 , he began the climb			1
it was quite some entrance ; it was quite some demonstration of the kind of feisty behaviour for which he became known in @entity71			0
when @entity29 headed the 20th - minute goal that turned out to be the winner , @entity3 crossed the line that no manager must cross			2
he left his technical area on a fist - pumping sprint 30 yards towards the corner flag			0
it ’s a shame @entity81 boss @entity80 has already claimed the @entity83 nickname			1
@entity84 , the fourth official , was waiting with a warning when he got back			0
‘ you have to celebrate , ’ he said after the game			0
‘ we have lost five in a row , confidence is lower than a snake ’s belly			1
then you get a goal			0
’ he stepped out again in the 83rd minute when @entity95 was brought down for a penalty and appeared keen to take the kick			0
with @entity65 goalkeeper @entity99 sent off and midfielder @entity100 taking the gloves , it was an appealing scenario			0
except @entity3 wanted @entity102 or @entity103 to take the kick			2
he repeated the error of leaving his box to pass this instruction to @entity109 but @entity84 intervened before calling over referee @entity110			0
he sent @entity111 to the stands			0
a popular figure at @entity52 , @entity3 struggled to find work in @entity54 despite having a commendable cv @entity117 scores a goal in @entity52 's famous win against @entity50 at home in november 2012 ‘ if i was arguing constantly or having a go at @entity100 ( @entity123 , the @entity65 manager ) and swearing ( it would be different ) but there was none of that			1
‘ i ’ve been sent to the stands when i was manager of @entity52 and deserved to be , but not here			0
’ @entity95 took the penalty and missed			0
@entity3 , sat behind the dugout , watched on as @entity65 launched a last wave			2
but @entity27 stood firm to get off the foot of the table			1
‘ one from one is all i can ask , ’ @entity3 said			2
@entity3 and @entity65 manager @entity123 exchange pleasantries ahead of saturday 's game at @entity137 's the @entity56 joined @entity27 in early october having previously shown interest in other vacancies @entity3 is already making a mark on @entity27 and has imposed a ban on players wearing hats during training except he will ask for a lot more			1
he has already told the players they can not wear hats in training			1
‘ i do n’t mind them warming up in hats but you do n’t head balls in games in hats , ’ he said			2
it ’s why some @entity157 fans came to the match in bobble hats			2
they have already taken to the new man			0
within 10 minutes they were asking for a wave and he obliged			0
they know better than to demand a win — but they got one of those as well			2
there might be more under this manager			0
at the very least , @entity54 football is more interesting because they finally let him in .			2
