by @entity0 in space , the lack of gravity can stretch an astronaut ’s spine causing them to grow in height by as much as 3 inches ( 7cm )			1
in an effort to prevent this , scientists have developed skin - tight spacesuits that mimic the force of gravity on the human body			1
using designs by @entity18 , scientists at @entity16 are refining the tight - fitting ‘ skinsuits ’ for testing in space to help astronauts overcome back problems			1
the @entity24 is a tailor - made overall with a bi-directional weave specially designed to counteract the lack of gravity by squeezing the body from the shoulders to the feet with a similar force to that felt on @entity31 the @entity24 is woven in two directions to counteract the lack of gravity by squeezing the body from the shoulders to the feet			1
current prototypes are made of spandex although new materials are being examined			1
‘ getting the suit to fit correctly was challenging , ’ said @entity39 , @entity40 team lead at the @entity42			0
floating in space , astronauts ’ bodies adapt to weightlessness in ways that are not always wanted			1
bone and muscle waste away as they have less work to do without gravity ( left )			0
on the right , the force the suit is producing is being measured at the feet with a computer using force transducers in the soles of the footwear imagine that the vertebrae in the human back comes in the form a giant spring			1
pushing down on the spring keeps it coiled tightly			0
when the force is released , the spring stretches out			0
in the same way , the spine elongates by up to three per cent while humans travel in space			0
there is less gravity pushing down on the vertebrae , so they can stretch out - up to 3inches ( 7cm )			2
the process gradually reverses once astronaut 's return to @entity31			0
however , the process can cause backache and a fourfold increased chance of slipping a disc			0
‘ we needed to create a suit that is both tight - fitting but comfortable to wear , while creating the right amount of force in the right places			2
’ floating in space , astronauts ’ bodies adapt to weightlessness in ways that are not always wanted			2
bone and muscle waste away as they have less work to do without gravity			0
as a result , astronauts suffer from backache during their missions			0
back on @entity31 an astronaut has four times more chance of suffering a slipped disc than usual			0
the issues are likely to pose an even greater challenge on longer missions such as journeys to @entity109			0
@entity111 astronaut @entity110 will be the first to wear the suit in space during his mission in 2015			1
the @entity24 has potential for use on @entity31 as well as for astronauts			1
‘ if the technology is effective in space , it could help the elderly and many people with lower - back problems on @entity31 , said mr @entity39			2
‘ additionally , @entity24 technology could improve the support garments currently used for conditions like cerebral palsy			1
’ students from @entity16 , @entity128 , wearing the ' @entity24 ' as subjects for a test of how well the suits perform			2

lack of gravity can cause astronauts to grow by around 7cm ( 3 inches )
the suit is designed to squeeze the body from the shoulders to the feet
current suit prototype is made from spandex and woven in two directions
@entity110 will be first to wear suit in space during 2015 mission
@entity24 technology could also improve the support garments currently used for conditions like cerebral palsy
