by @entity0 this is the hilarious moment a dog sounded a car horn for 15 minutes after its owner spent too long in an art gallery			1
@entity6 , an 18 - month - old boxer , was filmed leaning back in the driver seat with her left paw resting on the steering wheel and repeatedly pressing the horn on saturday afternoon			1
the animal had been left inside the car while her owner to finish browsing an art gallery in @entity15 , near @entity16 in @entity17			1
since being posted online yesterday , the footage of the impatient but ' attention - loving ' boxer has been viewed more than 8,000 times			1
at the time they thought little of the noise , and decided to browse the @entity42 art gallery			0
but after returning to their vehicle 15 minutes later they were shocked to see a large crowd gathered and grew concerned for @entity6 's welfare			1
mr @entity26 , 58 , said : ' i came out of the gallery and looked down the street and saw a crowd of people standing around , pointing at my car			2
' ' i started running because i was worried something had happened to her , ' he added			0
' when i got closer i realised people were pointing and laughing and taking pictures			2
she gave me a sideways glance and just kept on going , ' mr @entity26 went on			0
mr @entity26 , who worked for children 's charity @entity62 's before taking early retirement , said a young man on a scooter told him he had been watching @entity27 blast the car horn for around 15 minutes while he and his wife were looking at works of art in a nearby shop			1
although @entity27 regularly climbs into the front seat when left alone in a car , she has never actually used the horn before , mr @entity26 said			2
village : @entity6 repeatedly pressed the horn while waiting for her owners to finish browsing an art gallery in the popular tourist resort of @entity15 , near @entity16 in @entity17 adorable : @entity6 's new internet - celebrity status comes just a few months after she was fighting for her life after developing meningitis			1
thankfully she is now back to her lovable but bossy former self @entity27 's owners say they heard the faint sound of a car horn while wandering around the shops			1
they thought little of the noise , however , and decided to visit the @entity42 art gallery ( pictured ) mr @entity26 is concerned that his beloved pet boxer may repeat her new trick after all the attention it got her the first time around			2
' i think she is a bit of a diva			0
she just wants a bit of attention and she seems to have gotten her way this time ... i might have to put something on the driver ’s seat to stop her doing it again			0
' @entity6 's new internet - celebrity status comes just a few months after she was left fighting for her life after developing meningitis			1

the illness can lead to neurological complications - and even death - in both humans and dogs			0
@entity6 recovered from the illness shortly after @entity122 , and has continued to be the lovable but bossy dog she was before			0
' she ’s a typical boxer , she ’s a bit stubborn , a bit mischievous and very friendly ... she ’s the best boxer we ’ve had - she ’s the eighth one in my lifetime , ' mr @entity26 said			0
