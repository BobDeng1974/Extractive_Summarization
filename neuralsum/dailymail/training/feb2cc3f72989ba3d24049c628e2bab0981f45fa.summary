by @entity0 they were heralded as a demonstration of the travelling public ’s integrity			2
but after introducing honesty boxes to help time - pressed customers quickly pay for their newspapers , retailer @entity8 has discovered some shoppers can no longer be trusted to pay the correct amount			1
the company installed the boxes at around 60 train station kiosks and airport shops nationwide , after a trial at two branches showed sales had risen and checkout queues had shrunk dramatically - with no increase in shoplifting			1
@entity8 put the honesty boxes in shops in train stations and airports to allow shoppers to pay quickly but the store has now removed around a third of the boxes , which were sited near store newspaper racks and near store exits for customers who needed to buy a newspaper or magazine in a hurry			1
staff at a shop in a @entity38 rail station said that the box there had been littered with paper , chewing gum and foreign coins			2
one assistant called it a ‘ dishonesty box ’ and another said : ‘ you ’d be surprised			0
you turn your back ... ’ the boxes - which initially looked more like dustbins than boxes - were the brainchild of an executive who had spent several years working in the @entity56 , where newspapers are often sold from vending boxes			1
a @entity8 spokesman said it had honesty boxes in about 60 shops , but ‘ following some increasing concerns about the potential misuse of these facilities by a small minority , we have temporarily removed the honesty boxes from a small number of these locations ’			1
the spokesman said the company was considering moving the boxes to a ‘ more visible area within the store ’			2
@entity74 , a psychologist at @entity75 , said that it was ‘ petty theft ’ but offenders justified not paying the correct amount			0
a trail of the boxes showed that it increased paper sales and decreased queues but staff now have concerns about the system , with one staff member calling them ' dishonesty boxes ' she suggested that people had become less honest because they perceived big businesses to be greedy , adding : ‘ we change the goalposts of honesty to suit the cultural times we are living in			1
’ in a 2006 study of shoppers ’ behaviour a picture of a pair of eyes or a picture of flowers were placed above an honesty box during alternate time periods			0
wildly differing sums of money were deposited in the box			0
dr @entity106 , a behavioural biologist who led the study , said of it : ‘ when we had the picture of eyes on the wall it was nearly three times as much money			0
eyes give people the feeling that they are being watched by other people			0

concept was based on @entity56 - style newspaper vending boxes
it was trialled in two stores before being *rolled* out to 60
however a third have now been cut over concerns about the scheme
