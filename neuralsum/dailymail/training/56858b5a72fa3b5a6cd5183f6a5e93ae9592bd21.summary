by @entity0 and @entity1 will @entity2 survive until the end of the season ? @entity6 great @entity5 has delivered a grim assessment of his old club – and singled out £ 27.5million flop @entity9 for criticism			1
@entity9 was outclassed by @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 at @entity15 on tuesday night as @entity6 slumped to a humiliating 3 - 0 defeat in the @entity18 derby in front of their own fans			1
the @entity21 , whose only goal this season was for @entity24 against @entity25 in the @entity26 , was also lucky to escape a red card when referee @entity28 only booked him for blatantly thrusting a forearm into the face of @entity32 defender @entity31			1
‘ you have to admit that			2
for a central midfielder at @entity6 for £ 27m , i ’m expecting a few goals at least			1
‘ he did have problems with his wrist and i know he missed a lot of games but , for the money they paid for him , i ’d be expecting a lot more , to be honest with you			1
' asked if @entity9 should have been sent off , @entity5 replied : ' yes , without a shadow of a doubt			1
it 's a proper bang into his jaw			1
how do you get away with that ? i 've no idea			2
the referee 's stood five yards away			1
' @entity5 was appearing as a @entity42 pundit for tuesday ’s game and agreed with his former @entity15 team - mate @entity39 that @entity6 are suffering from a lack of pace			1
both seemed surprised that @entity9 was preferred to veteran @entity76 , who gave a virtuoso performance against @entity78 in the @entity79 last week			1
bad decision : former @entity6 midfielder @entity81 could n't understand why @entity76 was n't selected difficult night : @entity83 suffered from a lack of service as @entity6 struggled to get hold of the game ‘ whenever we played we always had quick players playing with us , ’ added @entity5			1
‘ tonight there was @entity91 and @entity83 who ran in behind a couple of times but did n’t get seen			2
‘ that ’s when you need players like @entity76			2
he is the one who will pass the ball forward			2
he does n’t care if he gives it away three or four times , he ’ll still risk it			2
to be a @entity6 midfielder you need risk in your game			1
‘ it looks to me that there are a few areas that need addressing			2
centre midfield , you could say they ’ve been looking for quite a few years now and have n’t quite come up with the answer			2
‘ going forward we ’re alright			2
the quality of @entity111 and @entity83 , @entity112 in his right position , i think we ’re all right up there			2
it ’s more midfield and defence where we need to look			0
‘ defensively , @entity118 is going and it looks like @entity120 and @entity121 could be going as well			0
that ’s three of your back four gone			1
that ’s another area he ’s got to look after			0
’ damning : @entity120 came in for criticism but @entity6 are bound to miss him if he is to leave the club on his way : @entity128 defender @entity118 is to sign for @entity130 giants @entity129 at the end of the season @entity5 believes that @entity6 should stand by @entity2 as pressure begins to mount on the beleaguered boss again in the wake of another embarrassing home defeat			1
and he hinted that the club had let their new manager down last summer by not offering him greater support to add to the signing of @entity9 before @entity112 arrived in january			1
‘ he ’s nine months into the job and you have to stand by him , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ he ’s made a couple of signings that have n’t worked out yet as he would have liked			0
in the summer he ’s going to need backing , there ’s no doubt about that			1
‘ was he backed as well as he could have been last summer ? i ’m not too sure			1
but this summer he has to be backed and i think he knows he needs players			1
' he does , however , indicate that the manager is making mistakes - particularly with @entity112			2
' he is a classic no 10 , ' said @entity5			1
' has he got to play in that position yet ? ' before adding his surprise at @entity157 being overlooked for the game			0
' i 'm amazed that @entity159 is n't playing , ' he mused at half time			0
' i would have loved to see him have a right go down that right hand side			0
' do n't sack him ! despite a horror run of results , @entity5 believes @entity6 have to stick with @entity2 the former @entity165 midfielder , who made 718 appearances in a glittering career at @entity6 , admitted that it was hard to watch @entity32 demonstrate the gulf in class between the two clubs as they won at @entity15 for the third time in a row			1
‘ @entity32 were far better than us , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ you could tell which team were going for the league and which team were in seventh , it was that glaringly obvious			0
‘ @entity32 have got the best team , the best players , they play the best football , they ’ve got goals everywhere			1
‘ in the first 10 minutes you thought maybe it could have been three or four			0
it could have been anything			0
' tonight i never believed we were going to get back into the game - even at 1 - 0			2
i was never really confident we were going to create chances and score goals			0
‘ in the second half we never got going			0
we huffed and puffed without creating clear - cut chances			0
that was always the way for us			0
we might have been two or three down but we never felt we were beaten			0
tonight i never really felt we were going to get back into the game even at 1 - 0			2
‘ @entity200 ’s been difficult but i ’m sure we ’ll have our day again			0
’ wizard : @entity12 was a standout performer for @entity32 as he kept things ticking for @entity204 's side looking ahead : @entity5 doubts whether @entity204 's side can win the @entity206 title @entity12 was electric for @entity204 's side during the thumping win , and @entity5 was understandably impressed : ' you have to be impressed with what he does			1
his touch … it ’s almost glued to his left foot			0
then he does the same with his right foot			0
either foot he ’ll take it and he can play a pass			0
' he has a little bit of pace about him as well			0
he can manoeuvre the ball well , play people in and has a goal in him			0
the first 10 minutes he was unplayable			0
' but the 39 - year - old was damning in his assessment of the first two goals			0
' does @entity9 stay with @entity12 ? ' he asked			1
' no. i 'm not sure what @entity225 has seen there , he 's created a big gap			2
' when dissecting the second , scored by @entity230 from a corner , @entity5 added : ' the warning signs were there - it had happened three or four times			1
( @entity237 ) @entity236 got in before			0
@entity120 wo n't be happy			0
@entity120 has stood off him there			0
you 've got to stay tighter			0

@entity5 says @entity9 ' has not been great ' for @entity6
' i *'d* be expecting a lot more ' adds @entity5 of £ 27.5m signing
@entity245 should have sent off against @entity32 ' without a shadow of a doubt '
@entity5 says @entity6 have to stand by @entity2 and back him in summer
