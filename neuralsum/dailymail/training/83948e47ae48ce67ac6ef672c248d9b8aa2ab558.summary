by @entity0 a @entity2 holidaymaker has discovered a type of spider that bears a striking resemblance to the creepy character @entity6			2
@entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , spotted the spooky - looking bug while she was visiting the @entity12 area of @entity13			1
both spiders and living skeletons are likely to give you a fright on their own , but a mish - mash of the @entity21 character an eight - legged insect makes for one scary - looking creepy - crawly			0
the white markings on the spider 's predominantly black body make its appearance very much like the protagonist in @entity30 's 1993 movie			1
the spooky critter : the spider 's markings might be to make it look more menacing that it actually is , in order for it to ward off attackers or predators the markings ( left ) bear a striking resemblance to the @entity6 character ( right ) from nightmare before @entity21 , @entity30 's 1993 animated classic a similar case , perhaps terrifying in a different way , is when a photographer in @entity47 was left speechless after he spotted the face of @entity49 on the back of a common stink bug			1
the snapper was getting some pictures of the local wildlife in his back garden when he spotted the bug had an incredibly peculiar pattern resembling the @entity59 ex-dictator			0
@entity60 , 29 , from @entity61 , @entity47 noticed almost straight away that the markings on the insect 's back resembled the hair line and tiny mustache that made @entity59 leader 's face so recognisable			0
he kept trying to get the bugs best side , but was unable to capture it 's most @entity74 - like pose because it kept running away .			0

skeleton spider was found in @entity13 by a tourist from @entity9
spiders and insects often sport *fearsome* markings to ward off foes
