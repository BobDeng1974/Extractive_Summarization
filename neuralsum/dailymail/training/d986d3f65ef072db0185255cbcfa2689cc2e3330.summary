calling herself a ' peace officer , ' @entity40 writes : ' as a single , @entity99 - @entity98 mother of five in this country , things are tough enough i should not have to endure harassment at the hands of someone who has been hired to protect the citizens of this land over an alleged “ speeding offense			1
