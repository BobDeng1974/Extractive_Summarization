@entity0 could get his wish after @entity2 said on monday he was open to a second spell as @entity6 @entity5 captain			1
@entity0 caused controversy on sunday when , within two hours of the @entity6 suffering a third straight defeat in the biennial contest , he criticised the approach of captain @entity11			1
with @entity11 sitting just a few feet away , @entity0 - who had been left out of a full day 's play on saturday for the first time in 10 @entity5 appearances - stated his support for the methods of @entity2 , who captained the side to their last win at @entity20 in 2008			1
@entity0 ( left ) alongside @entity11 , who he criticised swiftly after the conclusion of the @entity5 @entity11 's ( pictured ) captaincy produced a 16½ - 11½ loss for the @entity6 @entity0 plays out of a bunker on the 17th hole at @entity26 , @entity27 on sunday ' unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three @entity30 and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best , ' @entity0 said			1
asked if he would captain the side again , @entity2 told @entity33 : ' i 'm not going to rule anything out			2
' the 54 - year - old said the @entity6 needed to move away from appointing ' lone wolf ' captains , instead copying the @entity40 model of selecting players who had experience of the @entity5 as vice-captains			1
' the @entity44 ( which appoints the captain ) has officers that move up the ranks , getting sage advice along the way , and then many of them stick around and keep offering advice , ' @entity2 said			2
' i think the @entity44 should recognize their business model is exactly the same as what @entity40 uses in selecting a captain			0
' @entity56 celebrate with their partners following their @entity5 win on sunday @entity2 , pictured holding the @entity5 , was captain when the @entity6 last overcame @entity40 @entity11 ( centre ) shakes hands with winning captain @entity60 shortly before @entity40 's win was confirmed on sunday afternoon of the past 10 @entity6 captains , only two had previously been vice-captains			1
' there is a razor - thin line between winning and losing these matches , ' @entity2 added			0
' @entity40 has the intangible right now			0
they give themselves the extra one per cent chance to win through its business model and cohesiveness			0
' even if you play blackjack perfectly in a casino , the casino still has a very slight edge against you			0
right now @entity40 is the casino and the @entity6 is the guy walking to the blackjack table with a fistful of 50s			2
' @entity0 's comments , and the timing of them , drew fierce criticism with former @entity87 player @entity86 , who now works as an analyst for the @entity89 , saying : ' that was as close to a one - man mutiny as i have ever seen			2
i think that 's a moment that @entity0 would like to have back			0
@entity0 speaking to the media in the aftermath of the @entity6 's @entity5 defeat at @entity26 then @entity6 captain @entity2 waves his country 's flag after their 2008 @entity5 win ' if you are looking for a reason why the @entity6 continues to lose you just saw it , you saw it in one man , @entity0			1
' @entity0 , along with the best players of that era , have so corrupted the experience of the @entity5 for their fellow competitors by not having records anywhere near where they should given their rank in the game			2
' @entity2 's success was based on a ' pod ' system which involved creating three groups of four players and allowing them to have a major influence on decisions , while @entity11 appeared to rely almost exclusively on his opinion and that of his vice-captains			1
asked whether he was consulted in any of the decision - making at @entity26 , @entity0 said : ' @entity125 here was , in any decision			0
' @entity11 had said in the build - up that he would use a modified version of @entity2 's pod system , but added on sunday : ' i did n't discount it			1
i just had a different philosophy right off the bat			0
' @entity135 ( @entity0 ) has a difference of opinion			0
my management philosophy is different than his			0

@entity0 caused controversy on sunday when he openly criticised @entity11 's captaincy methods less than two hours after close of play
@entity0 cited @entity2 as being a better @entity5 captain , and *praised* his captaincy at the @entity6 's last win at @entity20 in 2008
@entity2 admits he would be open to a second spell as captain , and has *refused* to rule it out
@entity2 also stated that the @entity6 need to move away from appointing ' lone wolf ' captains , to instead copy @entity40 's selection process
