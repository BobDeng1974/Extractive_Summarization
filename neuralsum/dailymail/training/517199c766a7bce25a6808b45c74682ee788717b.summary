former @entity1 prime minister @entity0 has told the @entity2 into @entity3 of her anger at arriving home from holidays to find her bathroom had been demolished by her then boyfriend @entity8			1
during four hours of testimony , ms @entity0 denied having any knowledge of an illegal ' slush fund ' and having any role in setting up the account for the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) @entity16			1
ms @entity0 was answering questions about the fund , the purchase and renovations of an @entity22 property she owned in the 1990s , as well as the relationship she shared with mr @entity8 , an @entity15 official			1
mr @entity35 then homed in on how renovations at her property were paid for he , asking ms @entity0 ' were you annoyed that mr @entity8 had smashed up your bathroom ? ' she replied ' it was n’t my preference , no ' mr @entity35 put to the @entity53 that it was likely that mr @entity8 had paid tradesmen working on her home in cash , without her knowledge			1
ms @entity0 refuted his claim			2
' at the time of all of this , in 1995 , i took steps to satisfy myself that looking at the amount of work that had been performed on my home , that i had paid for it all			0
that i had documents , receipts , invoices , that showed that i ’d paid for it all , ' she said , noting that it was a very stressful time in her life			0
' i am sure that in our big wide world that there are tradespeople who take cash and do n't issue receipts , it was my practice to pay by cheque			0
' former pm @entity0 leaves the @entity2			2
earlier she told counsel assisting that she might have done some things differently but ' none of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards			2
obviously , if one got to do the whole thing again , you would do things differently given what i know now that i did not know at the time ' the former pm tendered four short separate statements ahead of proceedings			2
her lengthy evidence was punctuated by some jolting exchanges with counsel assisting			0
when pressed by mr @entity35 on whether she felt there was an issue with an the @entity16 ( @entity101 ) seeking incorporation under the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) banner , ms @entity0 replied : ' none of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards			1
obviously , if one got to do the whole thing again , you would do things differently given what i know now that i did not know at the time			0
' the ex-pm admitted to providing legal advice regarding the establishment of @entity16 and assisting with the incorporation of the association , as well as providing free work			1
' i provided legal advice , i then had no further contact with the work of the association or its workings			1
' she defended her decision to provide free legal work for mr @entity8 , when providing advice and assisting with the incorporation of the @entity16			1
the entity was allegedly used as a union slush fund in the early 1990s			2
ms @entity0 did however concede , that in hindsight , she could have opened a file for the advice but did not agree it was a substantial task			1
' mr @entity35 , i can assure you that i did more substantial jobs than this for free for trade unions during my days at @entity135 , ' she said			0
' whilst this matter has come to assume a great deal of significance in the years since , at the time of these events and my provisions of advice , it had no particular significance			0
ms @entity0 ( right ) worked for law firm @entity135 in the 1990s			1
' i was just trying to do my best and give them the benefit of my professional expertise ' she said of her work for @entity16 ' in terms of a busy legal practice it did not stand out amongst the many matters on which i advised			0
' ms @entity0 has maintained she did not have an ongoing advisory role and when asked said there was no indication that the full name of the association , @entity15 , @entity156 , would mislead people or cause confusion			2
she also again denied having any knowledge of any @entity16 - related bank accounts , filling in forms or providing any detail for or writing an advertisement promoting the association in question			0
when pressed on whether she might have provided advise for the advertisement in question , ms @entity0 fired back at mr @entity35 : ' i 'm giving evidence in a @entity2 , i 'm not prepared to guess			1
' and she added : ' i was just trying to do my best and give them the benefit of my professional expertise			0
' at one point , ms @entity0 clearly became agitated with the line of questioning and dryly replied to a question regarding what her practice was in respect to dating a document			2
' you put the right date on a document			0
' when pressed on whether she might have provided advise for the advertisement in question , ms @entity0 fired back at mr @entity35 : ' i 'm giving evidence in a @entity2 , i 'm not prepared to guess			1
' ms @entity0 often repeated that she was given no money by her former boyfriend , mr @entity8 , for the purchase of her house nor the renovations and despite their relationship , denied anything specific was discussed in relation to the setting up of the @entity16 account			1
she also detailed how in 1995 she took steps to satisfy that works on her property were paid for , and in a legitimate way			0
the ex-pm said she should have opened a file on the advice she gave to the unions but did not see it as necessary at the time ' i worked hard ... mr @entity8 worked hard ... there would not have been times where we would have been sitting at my house while tradespeople were working , ' she added			1
throughout the commission she maintained she knew no specific details about the fund and she and mr @entity8 did not discuss the specifics while at home			2
mr @entity35 asked : ' did you ever wonder whether mr @entity8 had some other source of income ? ' ms @entity0 said : ' there was nothing about his conduct which caused me to wonder			1
' but when she questioned him on it further down the track , ms @entity0 said mr @entity8 was ' evasive ' about the topic and she suspected he knew more than he had told her			1
this was during the time their relationship had already begun to break down			0
ms @entity0 has always denied allegations she knew that money from the fund was used to buy her house , and has publicly stated her belief that the fund was used for legitimate purposes			1
the commission is part of the investigation into the @entity245 , and is specifically looking at the fund called the @entity16 ( @entity16 )			0
ms @entity0 , right with former treasurer @entity247 , has always denied any wrongdoing over the slush fund set up by her former boyfriend @entity8 witnesses at the commission have previously testified mr @entity8 gave ms @entity0 money from the slush fund to pay for renovations to her house			1
in her statements presented to the @entity2 , ms @entity0 said : ' i purchased 26 @entity258 , @entity22 in may 1991			2
over time , between 1993 and 1995 , i had arious renovations done to the property			0
all payments made for renovations on my property were from my own money which was either derived from a loan from the bank and my salary			0
' ' @entity8 was not paying for the renovations at @entity258			0
' to my knowledge , i never received monies that came from an account operated by ( @entity8 ) @entity8 and ( @entity273 ) @entity272			0
' earlier , a key witness in @entity275 , a former @entity276 industrial officer and national secretary issued a public apology to the @entity279 , in recanting parts of his written testimony			0
mr @entity275 , described as a ' hostile witness ' by the commissioner , said he was embarrassed by his ' false memory '			0
he stated to @entity285 , @entity36 , representing ms @entity0 that he was suffering " acute embarrassment ' and wanted to express ' my apologies to your client for causing her any distress and discomfort , that would be mortifying to me and i am very apologetic that it has made its way into the public domain			2
' @entity8 fronted the commission earlier this year and said he had no conversations with ms @entity0 about the way the @entity16 funds would be used			1
on tuesday , a former colleague of ms @entity0 's from @entity300 and @entity302 @entity301 , told the commission despite hearing rumours in the mid- 1990s about the slush fund he believed ms @entity0 was innocent			1
@entity306 - now a federal court judge - said he believed the rumours were started by the former prime minister 's enemies .			0

former pm @entity0 told how she came back from a holiday to find her boyfriend had demolished the bathroom in her home
