@entity1 ’s 20 - yard rabona against @entity2 on thursday night was an ostentatious display of genius that took the breath away and had manager @entity6 proclaiming it the best goal ever scored by one of his players			1
it was , said @entity6 , a goal that could only have been scored by a player of @entity1 ’s skill			1
long time supporters of the @entity17 recognised the technique			0
there is grainy footage on @entity21 of him scoring from a rabona as a young teenager , playing in a junior game for @entity26 in his homeland			2
@entity1 's astonishing rabona strike put @entity29 in control against @entity2 @entity29 boss @entity6 gives @entity1 a pat on the back after his goalscoring exploits @entity1 's incredible strike doubled @entity29 's lead against the visitors as they went on to win 5 - 1 but what is the wider history of the rabona ? it is defined as striking the ball when the kicking leg is wrapped around the back of the standing leg - effectively with one 's legs crossed			1
particularly popular among players of @entity50 origin , the first rabona was scored in 1948 by striker @entity51 in a game between @entity17 teams @entity54 and @entity55			2
but it was @entity58 winger @entity57 who made the showboating act his own and later became revered as ' @entity61 , ’ or ‘ the father of the rabona ’			1
an even younger @entity1 for @entity26 's youth team runs through with just the goalkeeper to beat the now - @entity29 midfielder goes for the ' rabona ' strike over the on - rushing goalkeeper when interviewed in the 1990s @entity57 said : ‘ in every game the fans begged me to do it , they expected it			1
for me it was a natural thing			0
' i began crossing like this when i was very little			0
at least i did one thing before all the others			0
' now they call this move " rabona " because @entity80 did it , but @entity82 himself said in an interview that he remembered an @entity58 doing it before him : that was me			1
’ @entity86 performs his trademark trick during the @entity88 in @entity89 for @entity90 in june @entity91 performs the rabona during the @entity88 group stage match against @entity94 @entity80 and @entity82 perfected the technique but we could be seeing plenty more rabona in the @entity98 this season			1
@entity101 new boys @entity91 and particularly @entity86 are renowned for their sublime rabona kicks			2
@entity103 performs rabona kicks to pass and score , while @entity91 even employed a rabona to clear his own penalty area in a @entity88 match for @entity90 against @entity94 this summer			2
@entity110 legend @entity109 performs the rabona in 1991 as he dons the @entity110 jersey @entity113 ademonstrated against @entity114 that his skill matches the best when he performed a rabona @entity117 n’t try this trick if you ’ve not already nailed it on the training ground			0
yes , we ’re looking at you @entity123			0
the @entity125 midfielder attempted a rabona pass in a match against @entity128			0
