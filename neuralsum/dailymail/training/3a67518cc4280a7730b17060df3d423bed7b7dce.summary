@entity1 seemed unaware of the term 's significance when he included it in the caption of a photo showing his dramatic weight loss earlier last month			1

when one user called him out for using the negative term , he shot back with a comment reading ' @entity105 ' - which stands for ' do i look like i give a f * * * ? ' when one user tried to explain the significance of ' thinspiration ' , @entity1 shot back with ' @entity105 ? ' - meaning ' do i look like i give a f * * * ? ' @entity1 sent that comment to a friend of @entity110 , a 27 - year - old fat activist who sought to put the foodie in his place			1
online row : fat activist @entity110 , 27 ( pictured ) , was one of the many @entity10 users that tried to explain thinspiration to @entity1			1
he called her a c * * * in a post on her blog @entity119 , @entity110 described how @entity1 first ignored her comment on his page			1
she then wrote a post on her personal @entity10 , asking others to ' tell him that eating disorders are not a joke and nothing to take lightly '			1
that 's when @entity1 got even more angry , calling ms @entity110 a ' c * * * ' in a message that subsequently got deleted off his page			1
but that did n't stop him from using the hateful word again in yet another post on ms @entity110 's personal @entity10			0
when she told him he needed to apologize , @entity1 wrote back saying to ' give me a f * * * * * * break			1
' ' if anyone acts like a c * * * i 'll call them one			2
it 's not misogyny , it 's calling a spade a spade			0
maybe you 're the one being aggressive & unfair - and yes , if my use of the hashtag offended you , it was unintentional & for that i 'm sorry			0
' when two of ms @entity110 's friends wrote to @entity1 , he responded similarly			0
' seriously - grab a razor blade & draw a bath			0
i doubt anyone will miss you , ' @entity1 wrote to @entity10 user @ _ bechen to user @ thefattestfox @entity1 said : ' oh eat a bag of s * * * , dummy			1
' @entity1 did end up apologizing though , when he tweeted a statement saying : ' yes			0
i 've responded to internet hate recently with vile words directed at those hating me			0
i should know better & will do better			0
' proof : @entity110 shared screen shots of her online altercation with @entity1 in a blog post ' grab a razor blade and draw a bath ' : @entity1 went so far as to tell one of ms @entity110 's friends to commit suicide ms @entity110 says she has no problem with @entity1 's weight loss , just his use of a damaging words that has an even greater effect since he is a celebrity with more than 92,000 followers on @entity10			1
