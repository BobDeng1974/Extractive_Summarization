by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 's oldest indoor mall is now one of its newest settings for a trend in tiny - apartments			1
opened in @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 was nearly shut down in 2008 but the addition of 38 micro-loft apartments last year has saved the landmark from shuttering			1
now tenants are clamoring to pay $ 550 per month and up to live in the miniature homes , so much so there 's already a waiting list			1
however , there 's no oven			2

retail space has been preserved on the bottom floor the way it was : the arcade was nearly shuttered permanently in 2008 , but the micro-loft trend appears to have prevented that			0
