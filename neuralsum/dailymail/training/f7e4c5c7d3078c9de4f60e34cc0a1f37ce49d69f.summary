if working through your lunch break was n't depressing enough , then there 's more bad news			1

working lunch : eating in at your desk is also bad for your figure - with half of people polled for a survey admitting they had piled on the pounds from doing so the survey also found the traditional lunch hour was very much a thing of the past			1
whereas 10 years ago ago , 85 per cent of office staff took a lunch hour every day - now just 18 per cent do so because of added work pressures			1
@entity33 : 674 calories and 17.6g of saturated fat			1
@entity37 and carrot chutney sandwich : 515 calories and 12.6g of saturated fat			2

source : @entity51 supplement survey around 40 per cent of respondents had lunch at their desk every day - and a further 20 per cent said they did this most days			1
only 21 per cent said they never ate lunch at their desk			1
the study found that 58 per cent of workers felt under pressure to work through their lunch breaks despite craving a rest			2
a fifth took fewer than 15 minutes and the vast majority took no more than half an hour			0
but eating at the desk can cause serious weight gain			0
almost half of people confessed they were more likely to eat junk food at their desks			0
sixty per cent regularly ate chocolate or crisps or soft drinks from office vending machines - and then felt guilty afterwards			0
the results came in a new survey for the diet firm @entity75 , which found increasingly rushed work patterns were playing havoc with people ’s diets			0
although home - made sandwiches were the most popular choice , more than a third of workers ate more than 1,200 calories during a typical working day when their lunch was combined with drinks such as coffee and teas or soft drinks and vending machine snacks			1
weight gain was largely caused by office workers binging on crisps , chocolate and @entity14 at their desks rather than taking a proper break and eating healthier food			0
we also use junk food as a ' reward ' for working so hard a woman ’s recommended daily calorie intake is 2,000 calories and it is 2,500 calories for a man			0
@entity108 , managing director of @entity51 supplements , said : ' gone are the days when we would go out for lunch and socialise with workmates			0
' more of us are office bound and slaves to our computers			0
unfortunately that is very bad news for diets because we have n’t got the time to seek out healthier , less calorific foods			0
“ we are binging on crisps , chocolates and cans of coke			0
people are giving themselves these treats as reward when they do something well at work or to break up the daily routine			1

even those at outlets such as @entity33 , which rely on natural ingredients , can easily top 500 calories			2

around 40 per cent of people polled had lunch at their desk every day - and a further 20 per cent said they did this most days
most people who did take a break only took half an hour or less
*experts* warn that not having a break leads us to ' reward ' ourselves with fattening foods , rather seeking out healthy alternatives
survey also revealed the worst **offenders** for calories and fat when it comes to shop bought sandwiches - with @entity33 , @entity159 and @entity160 *key* **offenders**
