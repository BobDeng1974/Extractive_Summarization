a woman driver who dangerously careered down a busy motorway while five times over the drink drive limit had to be stopped by other motorists who bravely boxed her in and snatched her keys			1
@entity7 , 47 , of @entity8 , @entity9 , was driving so erratically that she almost crashed into a lorry and a central reservation while swerving across lanes on the @entity13 at 60mph			1
but despite putting her own life and the lives of others at serious risk - she claimed that she did not ' view ' herself as a criminal			1
thinking quickly , the man , who had been behind her , turned on his hazard lights and then pulled in front of her before putting on his brakes - blocking the road ahead			1
another motorist then also stopped and jumped out of his car , opening @entity7 's door and grabbing her keys from the ignition			1
they then called the police			0
when officers arrived and breathalysed @entity7 she recorded 162 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35 micrograms			1
at the police station , the lower of two more samples showed 142 micrograms , @entity49 heard			0
@entity7 later claimed that she did not think she would be over the limit and that she did not view herself as a criminal either			1
erratic : @entity7 was swerving across lanes on the @entity13 near @entity26 at 60mph in her @entity27 ( pictured ) and nearly crashed into a lorry and a central reservation before she was stopped but while sentencing her , district judge @entity58 , said : ' @entity60 , you are a criminal			1
this is the second time you have committed a drink driving offence in the past ten years			1
on the last occasion , it was a high reading			0
' on this occasion , it 's off the scale almost			0
your driving on that night was dangerous , to say the least			2
it was so poor that members of the public intervened to stop you driving any further			2
' the risk you posed on the @entity13 that evening , to the public , is really quite alarming			0
you could have killed yourself and you could have killed many other people			2
' it 's clear by the standard of your driving you had no control over that vehicle			2
' you did n't think you were over the limit			2
i can not accept that			0
you must have known you were in no fit state to drive			2
' in essence , what you did is take your car as a weapon onto the road			0
' it would be nice if the chief constable wrote to the witnesses in this case to recognise what they did on that evening , to prevent something more tragic occurring			0
' @entity7 admitted driving with excess alcohol on the @entity96 , at @entity25 , but was spared immediate jail , after the judge said one of the priorities of the court was to seek to rehabilitate her			1
depressed : her solicitor told @entity49 that @entity7 ( right ) was depressed following the birthday of her son who died in 2012 , aged 17 , after sniffing aerosols she was given 12 weeks in prison , suspended for a year , with 12 months supervision and must attend the @entity109			1
she was also banned for four years and ordered to take a retest at the end of it before she gets her licence back , for public safety			0
district judge @entity58 , who said @entity7 would be considered a high - risk driver who would be medically assessed by the @entity117 , ordered her to pay an £ 80 victim surcharge and £ 85 costs			1
@entity7 's son @entity120 , 17 , a talented rugby player , who had played for @entity121 , tragically died in november 2012 after sniffing aerosols			1
the carpentry student at @entity124 had lived in supported accommodation at @entity126 , @entity127 , after several years in a children 's home			0
banned : she received a four - year driving ban and was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison - suspended for a year his birthday was on august 4 and her solicitor told the hearing how @entity7 found the time around that date particularly difficult			1
@entity137 , defending , said @entity7 had had issues with depression and drink , had been in a very difficult relationship and had been ' tipped over the edge ' when her son died			1
the solicitor added : ' since this incident she has taken steps to try and address her problems			2
she is looking at counselling for depression , self harm and suicidal thoughts			0
' today , hopefully , will be a watershed and she can put everything behind her and make a fresh start			0
she is trying to put everything right			0
she is full regret , full of remorse			0
' to say she is terrified at the prospect of custody is very much an understatement			0
immediate custody would have a terrible and drastic effect upon this particular lady			0
