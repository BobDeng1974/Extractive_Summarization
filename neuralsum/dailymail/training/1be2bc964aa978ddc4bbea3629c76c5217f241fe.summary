by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 08:17 est , 17 january 2014 she 's pushing 25 years in the business , but @entity4 , who turns 40 today , is still at the pinnacle of fashion			1
the supermodel was spotted at the age of 14 by @entity10 founder @entity9 at @entity11 , and the skinny south @entity13 schoolgirl has since become an international icon and household name			2
and to mark her landmark birthday , a revealing new illustrated biography has been put together by @entity18 and is published today			1
it features lesser - known truths about the star , including the fact she paid @entity40 , the father of her daughter @entity41 , 11 , a cool £ 1 million when they broke up			2
it also reminds us of the time her younger brother @entity45 was signed to @entity10 , and how the pair starred together in a @entity49 campaign			0
the fascinating read is accompanied by hundreds of glamorous , intimate and revealing portraits			2
@entity52 and waifish in 1993 in @entity54 's @entity53 and swathes of @entity57 show ' @entity4 has grown up in public , ' journalist @entity58 wrote back in 1999 , ' into one of the most singular and shimmering icons our damp little islands have ever produced			1
' today , @entity4 is one of the most recognizable - and , against all odds , durable - stars alive			2
she 's exceeded the career expectation of a model by 15 years			0
to more than one generation the mother and wife - who said she 'd ' never dress like a wife ' - is an unconventional inspiration and the ultimate rock ' n ' roll style guru			0
supermodel @entity4 signs copies of her book , ' @entity4 ' , in 1997 @entity35 , @entity76 , @entity4 and @entity77 on holiday in @entity79 , @entity80 , 1996 with @entity81 ' @entity76 after the opening night of a @entity84 stage show in @entity13 , 1998 @entity4 has worked in fashion for over three decades , launching styles and defining trends			1
yet she never becomes dated			0
she is due to launch yet another range for @entity89 in april			0
her look evolves and so does she , making her an endlessly fascinating subject , both photographically and biographically			0
her rock ' n ' roll lifestyle and celebrity status provide compulsive viewing and reading			0
the book is compiled and written by author @entity18 , who thought @entity4 's 40th was ' worth landmarking '			1
and it 's because ' she 's endured particularly well , and her career has had a longevity that i think most people did n't think it would have when she was discovered at 14 , ' he tells the @entity104			0
happy times with close pal and fellow supermodel @entity107 in the 1990s at a launch hosted by @entity109 celebrating @entity4 by @entity110 in @entity13 , nov 15 , 2012 showing off that model body in a campaign shot for @entity113 although @entity18 has never met @entity4 , he compiled the book from media coverage and interviews with the very few friends of hers who will speak out , such as singer @entity120			1
' you wo n't find anyone with a bad word to say about her who knows her because a ) they are friends , and b ) there is this kind of fierce loyalty around her , there is a protective circle , ' he says			0
in the author 's opinion , @entity4 's lack of interaction with the press and presence on social media just adds to her intrigue and makes her even more appealing to the art world			1
' she 's got this sphinx - like quality , in that apart from her circle of celebrity friends , and business friends , no one really knows what she 's like , ' he speculates			0
@entity18 has also published books on @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			1
