a @entity1 fan who sparked outrage around the world over the last few days when she claimed she killed her pet @entity5 in a fit of rage because the @entity9 boy band did not respond to requests to follow her on @entity11 - is a hoax as many had suspected			1
the woman sent a desperate tweet to the five singers from her @ illumivato account two weeks ago saying : ' follow me or i 'll break my dog 's neck '			2
the post was accompanied by a picture showing someone pinning a dog to the ground by its throat			2
sick : a montage of images from the @entity11 account of a @entity1 fan claiming to break her dog 's neck after the band did not respond to her plea to follow her hoax : while the @entity11 user claimed that she had killed the dog in august - this image of the same girl was in circulation in june on the internet confession : @ illumivato admitted that she was a troll and the claims were not true after being besieged by angry users and before her account was suspended by @entity11 but with millions of tweets being sent to their account everyday , the group very likely did not spot the message and it went ignored			1
several days later , she wrote directly to band member @entity53 on the social networking site to say : ' i love you			0
my dog has just died			0
' she added a picture that she claimed showed her crying as she cradled a dead dog			2
but that image has been widely used by internet users to create memes on @entity65 speaking sites since june - a full month before @ illumivato had claimed to have killed the dog			1
it appears to have been part of a trend in @entity71 where @entity73 users have been posting bizarre pictures on social media to get comments under the hashtag # palface , short for ' pone @entity73 ' , or put on @entity73			0
the image usually has the words ' lol se murio mi perro ' written across it , meaning ' lol ( laugh out loud ) my dog died '			0
many internet users were appalled to think that someone could really kill the dog - but many will be as equally outraged to think that anyone would find the hoax remotely funny			0
adored across the world : with millions of tweets being sent to their account everyday , the @entity1 singers very likely did not spot the message and it went ignored other images that were reportedly taken from the @ illumivato page before it was suspended show animals in blenders and a small child tied up			1
each comes with similar messages threatening to kill them if the boy band did n't follow her on @entity11			2
another image that the same user posted of a cat in a blender is easily available on @entity109 images too			1
retrieved tweets from the account also show similar threats were sent to @entity113 and @entity114			1
fans of the band , known as ' @entity1 ' , branded her a ' psycho ' , with one setting up a petition on @entity119 demanding she be imprisoned which now has around 3,000 signatures			0
the identity of the troll has not been revealed however and it is not even clear whether that person is even a man or a woman			0
troll : some other images reportedly taken from the @ illumivato page show animals in blenders and a young child tied up with messages threatening to kill them if @entity1 did n't follow her on @entity11 @entity135 , who set up the petition , said : ' this person needs to burn in hell and i want to see justice			1
' one direction has not yet commented on the incident .			0

' fan ' threatned to kill dog with image of dog being pinned to the *floor* by its throat if the band did not follow her
when @entity1 did n't she posted picture of ' her with dead dog ' at the end of august
but that image was used on @entity160 sites in june on memes
other images reportedly from her site show animals in blenders and a small child tied up with similar threats to kill them
one of those images is an image plucked from @entity109 images
retrieved tweets show offending user @ illumivato admitted she was a troll on @entity11 before her account was suspended
