@entity0 has taken a baseball bat to countless guys			1
he has stabbed , shot and killed dozens more			2
he has been pistol whipped , been brutally beaten , has had his life threatened and survived two years in a @entity6 jail so appalling that the president of the country has said he 'd rather die than go there			1
today he is a free man , immaculately dressed and drinking a vodka martini in @entity12 's @entity11			1
and this , he has just announced , is the hardest time he 's ever had			2
because according to @entity15 people do n't change , yet change is precisely what @entity15 is trying to bring to his life and , he hopes , the lives of kids on the brink of making the mistakes he made decades ago			1
it 's the reason , he believes , he 's still alive			2
speaking to @entity25 he said , ' honestly i 've thought about it every single day			1
i believe i did n't do the right thing but i believe there 's a reason why i 'm supposed to be here			2
' when people say you baseball batted a hundred people and stabbed however many , you shot 37 , i ca n't forget it			0
let me tell you how i justified it			0
i did n't hurt women			0
i did n't rob an armored car in my life because that 's a hard working guy and i would never be prepared to hurt him			1
he says : ' you can fool someone who 's not a gangster			2
but take a street guy , a real tough guy and they can read through all his b * * * * * t. you ca n't fake it			0
but you can learn it			0
' convicted : just two of the mugshots @entity15 featured in , both taken in @entity6 in 2003 and 2004 when he was arrested over a string of offenses and held in its most notorious prison ' but did i rob drug dealers ? yes , all the time			1
did i hurt street guys ? yes , all the time			0
did i shoot street guys ? yes , all the time			0
did i shoot people who were hanging out with wise guys ? yes , all the time			0
but outside of that ? no. ' what i did , i ca n't take back and when i was doing what i was doing i was proud of it			0
but i have enlightenment now			0
whether it 's because i got into trouble or whether it 's because i got disheartened from them turning on me , does n't matter how i got it , but i did get it eventually			2
' now , three years after his release from jail , he is ' reinventing ' himself as a motivational speaker who hopes to ' scare kids straight , ' give corporate employees an aggressive edge and consult on movies and tv shows trying to accruately portray the world in which he once live and excelled			1
for more than twenty years @entity0 was a high ranking member of the @entity93 crime family			1
he worked for the @entity94 – both father and son			1
he was , he said , ' at the top of the food chain ' , one of their top earners and enforcers			2
he could never be a ' made ' man in the mafia because the grandson of @entity105 immigrants was born in @entity106 , @entity107			1
but he thought he was moving in a world governed by rules ; codes of honour , loyalty and respect			2
then , when he was in jail in @entity6 , @entity15 was passed secret 302s ( files kept by the @entity116 documenting interviews with their informants ) showing that @entity119 , the man who had stood by him when he married his first wife in 1998 , was ' a super-rat '			1
boss : @entity119 , also known as @entity124 , who was at the head of the @entity93 crime family			1
but @entity0 says that ultimately he and his son proved to be liars ad not men of honor friends turned enemies : @entity119 ( center ) and @entity0 ( left ) as friends in the mid- 1980s			1
but they are now enemies , with @entity15 having given evidence against @entity119 , who @entity0 says was himself a rat according to @entity15 , he realized that he had bought into a lie – the ' seductive image ' was just that , an image			1
the @entity94 – father and son – were not men of substance but cowards , sold out by their own lawyer who , @entity0 said , handed over the 302s to his contact			1
@entity15 cut his own deal			1
in 2008 he secretly pleaded guilty to two murders , four conspiracies to murder , at least eight shootings and two attempted shootings as well as armed home invasions and armed robberies in @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			1
he testified in the trial of gambino family enforcer @entity162 – now serving a life sentence for four murders			1
he went onto testify against @entity119 but after 11 days of deliberations the jury came back deadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial			1
the jury stated that they had n't trusted prosecution witnesses – especially @entity0			1
on april 26 , 2011 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison			1
he was released in 2013 having served six since his extradition			0
@entity119 's role as an @entity116 informant has since emerged publicly but , much to @entity15 's , frustration it has gained fewer column inches than he feels it deserves and he rails against the fact that @entity119 's claim that he left the mob of his own volition is rarely publicly challenged			1
he said : ' in 1999 he claims he retired			0
in 2001 he gets caught on tape mad that his uncle brought him down from boss to skipper			0
in 2005 he gets caught co-operating			0
meaning he was thrown out of the mob			2
' there is no such thing as quitting			0
there 's no two weeks ' notice and there 's no pension			2
' according to @entity15 , for whom this is all deeply personal , anything that preserves @entity119 's image is ' glorifying the mob			1
' he said , ' if you 're glorifying the mob you 're killing kids			1
you 're teaching kids to respect the wrong thing			1
you 're teaching them to respect a coward			1
' at 52 @entity15 still carries himself like the wise guy mobster he once was			1
he is physically fit , heavily tattooed and charismatic			0
he 's the real deal and dangerously close to glamorizing the very thing against which he is speaking out by virtue of his own charm			2
but he insisted , ' i 'm not proud of what i did			0
i lived then as if i was at war			0
i was like an alcoholic with violence			2
now i 'm not like that			0
now i 'm a little more controlled			0
' now the services he offers are strictly cerebral			2
with ' @entity221 and at @entity223 ' talks he draws on his own credibility as a mobster to dismantle any lingering delusions that there is anything glamorous or desirable about that life			2
regrets : @entity15 has four grown - up children and says that he regrets not being a part of their lives as much as he should have been because of time spent behind bars mafia presence : @entity119 was at the head of the @entity93 crime family and @entity0 's boss			1
but now that the former mob henchman has gone straight he says : ' i 'm doing it the right way			1
' he said , ' if i go into a juvenile center and talk to 300 kids ages 12 to 17 then i 'm not going to reach all 300 , but maybe i can reach one or five or 10			1
and i 'll tell you now if i go in and talk to them or if a psychologist does this talk , they 're going to listen to me , there 's the difference			1
' similarly the man who once prided himself on being the consummate predator is now offering his wisdom in anti-bullying speeches			2
he explained , ' being a victim or not being a victim is all about the way you walk , the way you talk , the way you carry yourself			2
same thing in the prison system			2
and a predator in those situations , in the street or in jail , they can sense it , they can feel it			0
' you can fool someone who 's not a gangster			2
@entity119 could walk into this room and fool someone who 's not a street guy			1
' but take a street guy , a real tough guy and they can read through all his b * * * * * t. you ca n't fake it			0
but you can learn it			0
' once a millionaire many times over @entity0 was financially successful – legally and illegally – because , he said , he was ' aggressive '			1
when speaking to corporate clients he can offer ' experience beyond anybody 's education			1
' and few can lay claim to inspiring the level of respect he once held , something , he insisted that has nothing to do with fear and everything to do with credibility			0
for his own part @entity0 is not without regrets			1
as a father of four adult children ages 18 to 25 he admitted : ' i feel really bad for my kids because i was n't there for them because of my crazy lifestyle			2
' ' but , ' he said , ' at some point in your life you have to take blame for what you did : right , wrong or indifferent			0
when someone says they do n't feel guilt i think they 're a liar or a sociopath			0
' truthfully at the time i thought i was invincible			0
now i do n't sleep well			0
i go to therapy all the time and it 's a constant work in progress			0
' of course i miss the money			0
of course i miss that i was a big shot			0
i 'm like everybody else			0
i want to get the clothes , the nice things , but it 's not worth it			0
before i did n't care how i got it			0
' now , i do n't want to lose direction and become the person i used to be			0
this is the hardest time i 've ever had – trying to reinvent myself but i 'm doing it through hard work , i 'm doing it the right way			0
