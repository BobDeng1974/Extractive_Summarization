a @entity1 spacecraft orbiting the red planet has found the ' strongest indication ' that liquid water may still exist on the @entity6 surface			1
images taken by @entity8 reveal ' finger - like ' markings on @entity6 slopes			1
experts say that although they do not yet have a ' smoking gun ' , they believe the markings are made by minerals which could not have left without flowing liquid			1
@entity17 , seasonal flows emanate from bedrock exposures at @entity19 on @entity6 in this image from the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) camera on @entity1 's @entity8			1
astronomers believe the dark ' fingers ' above hold the key to water on @entity6			2
known as ' recurring slope lineae ' or rsl for short , they are dark lines that are observed moving down the slopes of some @entity6 mountains as temperatures on the surface rise			0
experts believe these flows might be caused by saltwater containing a iron sulfate solution to keep it from freezing in @entity6 temperatures			2
' the features are dark , finger - like markings that advance down some @entity6 slopes when temperatures rise , ' @entity1 said			1
the new clues include corresponding seasonal changes in iron minerals on the same slopes and a survey of ground temperatures and other traits at active sites			0
these support a suggestion that brines with an iron - mineral antifreeze , such as ferric sulfate , may flow seasonally , though there are still other possible explanations			1
researchers call these dark flows ' recurring slope lineae '			0
' we still do n't have a smoking gun for existence of water in @entity28 , although we 're not sure how this process would take place without water , ' said @entity67 , a graduate student at the @entity69 , @entity70 , and lead author of two new reports about these flows			1
he originally discovered them while an undergraduate at the @entity76 , @entity77 , three years ago , in images from the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) camera on @entity1 's @entity8			1
@entity67 and @entity69 assistant professor @entity80 more recently looked at 13 confirmed rsl sites using images from the same orbiter 's @entity83 for @entity6 ( @entity86 ) instrument			2
they found ' distinct and consistent ' spectral signatures of ferric and ferrous minerals at most of the sites			0
' just like the @entity28 themselves , the strength of the spectral signatures varies according to the seasons , ' said @entity67			0
river on @entity6 ? this image combines a photograph of seasonal dark flows on a @entity6 slope with a grid of colors based on data collected by a mineral - mapping spectrometer observing the same area			2
@entity1 believes it could reveal salty liquid water			1
the purple and pink colors of the image represent spectra with absorption of light at wavelengths of 920 nanometers and 530 nanometer , which the researchers say indicate a concentration of ferric iron , and a clue that water flows in the area			0
' they 're stronger when it 's warmer and less significant when it 's colder			0
' these results are in a paper published in the journal @entity125			0
the leading hypothesis for these features is the flow of near - surface water , kept liquid by salts depressing the freezing point of pure water			1
' the flow of water , even briny water , anywhere on @entity6 today would be a major discovery , impacting our understanding of present climate change on @entity6 and possibly indicating potential habitats for life near the surface on modern @entity6 , ' said @entity146 scientist @entity145 , of @entity1 's @entity147			2
in a seperate paper , by @entity69 scientists and colleagues at the @entity76 ; @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 ; and @entity155 , @entity156 , a team used the @entity8 and @entity1 's @entity158 orbiter to look for patterns in where and when the dark seasonal flows exist on @entity6			2
their results indicate that many sites with slopes , latitudes and temperatures matching known rsl sites do not have any evident rsl			0
' @entity1 likes to ' follow the water ' in exploring the @entity6 , so we 'd like to know in advance when and where it will appear , ' professor @entity80 said			0
' @entity28 have rekindled our hope of accessing modern water , but forecasting wet conditions remains a challenge			0

images taken by @entity8 reveal ' finger - like ' markings that may have been left by salt water
experts say briney liquid could flow seasonally
admit there is still no ' smoking gun ' for water on the red planet
