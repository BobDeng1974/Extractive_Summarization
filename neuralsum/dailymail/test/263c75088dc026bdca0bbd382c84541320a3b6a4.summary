the hit @entity1 tv series @entity2 features @entity3 , played by @entity4 , and his wife @entity5 , played by @entity6 so here ’s the deal			1
step one : book a private dining room at @entity12 ’s @entity11			1
step two : invite your political enemies to lunch			2
step three : ask the waiter for an extra-sharp steak knife			2
lunch is never just lunch when you ’re dining in the shadow of @entity20			0
it ’s an exercise in power - broking and political assassination			1
i ’d come to @entity12 to learn some tricks from @entity2 – the hit @entity1 political tv series starring @entity4 as @entity3 – on how best to neutralise your opponents			1
@entity1 ’s capital is filled with @entity3 wannabes : senators and governors with razor tongues and egos to match			1
the @entity11 is a favoured venue for political plots			0
with crisply starched linen , glittering candlesticks and heavy silver cutlery , the decor suggests an atmosphere of civility and restraint , while the stuffed heads of deer and bison are redolent of a @entity47 country mansion			0
but there ’s a subtext to those severed heads : this is a place where the hunt always ends in a kill			0
i ’ve been brought here by @entity54 , whose job is to sell @entity12 to foreign visitors			1
the seat of the @entity58 is in the @entity59 , atop @entity20 in @entity12 i ask if the city really functions as darkly as it does in @entity2			1
she swings around in her chair and points towards a closed door			0
‘ that ’s one of the private rooms , ’ she says			0
‘ and there ’s a senator hosting a political lunch in there right now			0
’ my imagination goes into overdrive			0
if the host was @entity3 , he ’d certainly be exploiting it for political gain			0
much of the action in @entity2 takes place on @entity20 , home to the @entity81 and the @entity82			1
there are tours of the vast building and it ’s a good introduction to how the city ticks			0
my guide is @entity90 , a preppy student with a smile like @entity92 ’s			0
the @entity93 was built to honour the 16th president of the @entity59 , @entity94 he whisks me around the gilded splendour of the old @entity81 , as well as the still - functioning chamber of the new			2
it ’s easy to forget you ’re touring a working political building – a place where senators , advisers and policy wonks battle for influence			0
for more than two centuries , arm - twisting and bullying has been the reality of @entity1 politics			1
even the hallowed founding fathers relied on strong - arm tactics to pass legislation			2
as @entity90 spills stories of feuds and political assassinations , i realise that men like @entity3 have been controlling @entity12 ever since the birth of @entity1			1
@entity118 pictured at the @entity11 some of those early politicians – such as the seventh president , @entity120 – were so fiery that they make the players in the tv series look like amateurs			1
president @entity120 ’s solution to every problem was to fight a duel : @entity90 jokes that his body was so full of lead - shot that these days he would n’t get through the metal - detectors at the entrance to the @entity59 building			2
@entity12 was chosen as @entity1 ’s new capital in 1790 after months of haggling and compromise			1
the states of @entity136 and @entity137 each agreed to donate land in order that one small area – the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) – could be placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of @entity58			1
this holds true to this day			0
despite its status , the city faces a struggle to lure tourists away from @entity147			0
yet @entity12 has many more public monuments than its rival , including the two biggest hits in @entity1 : the @entity151 ( tours have to be reserved in advance ) and the @entity154 , home to the @entity156 , the @entity157 and the @entity93			1
the latter is a vast statue built to honour @entity94 , @entity1 ’s 16th president and considered by many to have been its greatest			1
@entity1 president @entity162 ( left ) pays for his lunch at @entity165 restaurant ( right ) in 2009 every politician needs to connect with his or her voters : @entity3 and @entity162 are no exception			1
@entity3 ’s way of connecting is to go to @entity172 ’s @entity171 and eat ribs			0
when @entity162 wants to connect , he heads 12 blocks north from the @entity151 to the intersection of @entity176 and @entity177			0
this rough - and - ready area , just below @entity179 , has been transformed into a popular shabby - chic district in recent years			2
more famously , it ’s home to @entity165 , an all - american burger and hot - dog joint and a favourite of @entity162			2
you do n’t come here for gastro - cuisine			2
@entity188 ’s serves junk food with a spicy twist			0
a plastic sign proclaims it to be ‘ a @entity12 landmark ’			1
at 10am it ’s doing a brisk trade in chilli - dogs dripping with cholesterol – but they certainly kick - start the morning			2
the main building on the @entity154 contains 1.5 million square feet of space and altogether is the size of 18 football fields @entity12 ’s biggest draw is resolutely apolitical : the @entity205 is one of the greatest museum complexes in the world			1
it has it all , from rembrandts to rockets , along with stuffed elephants and tribal headgear			0
best of all , @entity215 ’s legacy decreed that all the museums established with his legacy must always be free , including the @entity205 ’s @entity218			0
sandwiched between the many museums of the @entity205 is one of the city ’s least likely attractions			0
the @entity223 viewed from the @entity224 the @entity223 is a classical beast of a building that displays an early copy of the @entity228 ( which inspired the authors of the constitution ) , daguerreotypes of cowboy pioneers in the @entity233 and terrifying tracts written by the @entity235			0
the stars of the show are found in the @entity238 , which houses the three documents that defined @entity1 – the @entity240 , the @entity241 and the @entity242			1
yellowing , faded and scarcely legible , they are powerfully emotive symbols of the @entity1 dream			1
all the hopes of early @entity1 are contained in these three pieces of parchment			2
‘ @entity257 ’ are the opening words of the @entity241 , a text that extols the lofty principles of justice , liberty and welfare – universally ignored by the characters in @entity2 and , alas , by a large number of flesh - and - blood politicians			1
@entity258 ( @entity259 , 020 8742 8299 ) offers four nights at the @entity261 in @entity12 from £ 799 per person , including return flights from @entity264			2
