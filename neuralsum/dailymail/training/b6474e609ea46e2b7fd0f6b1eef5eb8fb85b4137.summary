by @entity0 published : 17:22 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 17:26 est , 14 october 2013 fighting spirit : 5ft 6ins @entity2 screamed as loud as she could until her attacker fled her reaction was , by her own admission , ‘ pure instinct ’ and certainly not what her attacker was expecting			1
former @entity8 arts correspondent @entity2 yesterday described how she fought off a 6ft - tall thief who grabbed her mobile phone as she walked her border terrier in a park close to her £ 2million home			1
the 48 - year - old broadcaster , a mother of four , had decided to take @entity15 for a stroll and was leaving a message for her husband when the mugger crept up behind her and snatched the device from her hand			1
however , instead of meekly accepting her plight , miss @entity2 , who has a slight build and is 5ft 6ins tall , found herself grabbing hold of the robber and screaming repeatedly as loud as she could			1
so alarmed was the man he threw miss @entity2 into a lavender bush and dropped her @entity30 phone as he fled			1
describing her actions as ‘ pure instinct ’ and probably ‘ ill - advised ’ , she said yesterday : ‘ ‘ i was leaving my husband a message on my phone when i felt this hand coming over my right shoulder and grabbing it			2
at first i thought it was a friend			2
‘ it was like a dream			0
i was thinking : ‘ this is actually happening			0
my phone is being stolen			0
’ ‘ i then grabbed his hand and screamed ‘ @entity44 ’ as loud as i could			1
there was no one close to me so i just kept screaming			2
‘ the robber then pulled his arm away because i was screaming so loudly			2
i ’ve got a really loud voice which my children are well aware of			2
’ @entity52 and a park warden heard her screams and chased after her attacker , who miss @entity2 describes as mixed race and around 28 years - old , but without success			1
the attack took place 20 yards from her £ 2million terraced home in the fashionable enclave of @entity61 , north @entity62 , at 12.20pm on sunday			1
day job : here the slight presenter is working on a feature where she tries to get by without a supermarket miss @entity2 praised her neighbours for coming to her aid and the police who arrived within two minutes			1
she said : ‘ ‘ the park warden and another person came running over			0
lots of the neighbours heard my screams and gave chase			0
’ ‘ i now feel more vulnerable and i ’m definitely going to keep my phone out of sight			0
it ’s ironic , because i ’m always telling my children to be careful where they use their phones			0
‘ thinking about it , perhaps i should have let him have the phone because i worry about people with knives			0
‘ i hope it will make him less likely to attack a woman in the future			0
’ prized possession : miss @entity2 , 48 , clung onto her @entity30 during the 12.20pm attack			1
the 6ft - tall thief ran miss @entity2 , who is married to tv documentary maker @entity94 , 53 , also described the incident to her followers on social networking site @entity99			1
she admitted that her reaction was ‘ pure instinct ’ , but perhaps it was also ‘ ill advised ’			0
last night a @entity104 spokesman said officers were called to reports of a street robbery			0
he said : ‘ the area was searched but there was no sign of the suspect			0
the phone was recovered to its owner			0
’ the broadcaster was the @entity8 art correspondent between 1995 and 2004 and now works on a freelance basis			1
during the coverage of the @entity119 , presenter @entity117 said miss @entity2 had ‘ the best supporting dress ’ after she appeared on screen in a daring strapless @entity123 dress .			2
