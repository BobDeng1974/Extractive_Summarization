in @entity2 circles , @entity0 used to be referred to as ' liquid gold '			1
but more and more celebrities are seemingly shunning injections and fillers to return to a somewhat au natural look			1
experts agree that the tide seems to be turning against surgical attempts to turn back time , with recent photos of a-listers such as @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 looking more their age			1
although @entity13 and @entity28 have admitted to only using @entity0 once , they are among a string of @entity2 's leading ladies whose appearance has caused them to be dogged by surgery rumours			1
mother - of - two @entity28 , 42 , has openly spoken about her dabble with @entity0 , saying it made her look like late comedian @entity34			2
speaking to @entity37 @entity36 , the actress said she would be ' scared to go under the knife ' , although she admitted that may change as she gets older			2
' i 'll try anything			2
except i wo n't do @entity0 again , because i looked crazy , ' she said			2
' i looked like @entity34 ! ' @entity43 star and former friends star @entity14 sparked concern that she had taken her admitted use of @entity0 too far in 2013 , when she was pictured looking very puffy in the face			1
the 50 - year - old actress looked almost unrecognisable from her former days as lovable obsessive @entity50			2
@entity28 's face looks far less ' pulled back ' with a few natural lines on her face ( left in 2012 , and right 2014 ) however , like her former co-star @entity13 , the mother - of - one has been looking more natural of late			2
as well as her lips seemingly looking thinner , her cheeks look less puffy and there are some fine lines visible around her eyes			0
similarly @entity61 has been seen out and about with some natural lines and wrinkles , particularly around her eyes			1
while still looking unbelievably youthful for her 46 years the @entity65 singer has lost her former ' plastic look '			0
she admitted recently that she would no longer consider @entity0 , saying : ' i wont't go near it			0
i have lines , you can see them on my face			0
' @entity72 was one of the first stars to shy away from the trend for surgical help			1
the 58 - year - old @entity77 actress has spoken about her desire to age gracefully			1
@entity61 has been seen out and about with some natural lines and wrinkles , particularly around her eyes ( left in 2010 , right in december 2014 ) @entity72 , 58 , left in 2010 and right in 2014 , used @entity0 in the past but says she wants to age gracefully she has previously admitted to using @entity0 on her forehead , but is too frightened to have surgery , saying in 2008 : ' i do n't want to look in the mirror and not recognise who 's looking back			1
' and it seems this a-list trend is trickling down to average women			0
@entity92 - @entity91 , non-surgical director at @entity94 , said : ' we have seen a significant rise in enquiries for non-surgical procedures to create a more natural finish whilst embracing the ageing process			1
' these include chemical facial peels , @entity103 and @entity104			0
' we have also found that those requesting @entity0 are more frequently asking for a more natural look to beat the ageing process – using less product and leaving more time between their treatments			1
' we are seeing more women requesting to have some movement in their face rather than the frozen look			0
' it 's certainly becoming increasingly popular to seek a more sophisticated kind of beauty , rather than the taut and overdone look			0
' @entity120 , chairman at @entity122 cosmetic surgery , said : ' more and more of our patients , like celebrities , are keen to make sure their @entity0 and fillers look natural			0
' of course , it ’s standard practice for us to make those recommendations			0
why is it on the rise ? ' i think people have seen so many cases of bad jobs on either celebrities or acquaintances that it ’s made them realise the effects too much @entity0 can have			0
it can make people look older			0
