' his remarks , reported by @entity28 news , come just a week after 20 - year - old @entity29 walked into @entity30 in @entity31 and shot dead 20 children and six adult staff members			1
the massacre has led to calls for tighter gun restrictions in @entity37 where bearing arms is a constitutional right			1
earlier this week president @entity40 announced that vice president @entity41 will lead an effort to come up with policies to address gun violence mr @entity40 said that mr @entity41 will work with members of his cabinet and other officials to come up with proposals by january - assuring the @entity37 public this is not merely a @entity52 commission to study the issue but promised real reforms in a timely manner			1
