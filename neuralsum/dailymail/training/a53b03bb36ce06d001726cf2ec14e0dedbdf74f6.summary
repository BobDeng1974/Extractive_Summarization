tribute : each of the 888,246 poppies planted represents a @entity149 solider who died during the @entity150 journey : the poignant tribute in the tower 's moat has come a long way since work originally started on it back in the summer ( above ) each poppy is handmade and carefully shaped by a team of workers in @entity243 each poppy is handmade and individually shaped by a team of local workers in @entity243 , making each poppy unique			1
@entity248 is sliced by hand and rolled into large flat sheets and a metal stamp , much like a large biscuit cutter , carves out petal patterns			0
they are then paired together by hand to form six overlapping petals			0
the petals are individually moulded to create the shape of the flower and fired to fix their position			0
the bright red glaze is applied to the fired poppies before they are returned to the kiln for the second and final firing			0
ceramic artist @entity67 , who came up with the idea , has had a team working on the project since january			0
he said : ' i was inspired to create this installation after reading a living will by an unknown soldier who we think may have been from @entity243			0
i approached the @entity2 as the ideal setting as its strong military links seemed to resonate			0
' the installation is transient , i found this poignant and reflective of human life , like those who lost their lives during @entity150			0
i wanted to find a fitting way to remember them '			0
he came up with the idea of creating a ' sea ' of poppies two years and was delighted when the @entity2 decided to bring his idea to life with the help of set designer @entity156			2
the artist has experience of working with historic buildings and over the last three years he has been commissioned to create large - scale installations for the @entity293 's @entity292 , @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 .			0
