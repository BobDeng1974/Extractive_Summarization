by @entity0 published : 10:05 est , 7 december 2012 updated : 10:36 est , 7 december 2012 @entity1 has said goodbye to his mustache - his faithful companion for the last 40 years			1
the idea to part with the facial hair first came during the 2012 presidential race when @entity1 , president @entity8 's senior campaign adviser , announced he was so confident that the @entity10 incumbent would win the key battleground states of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 that @entity1 would shave his mustache if @entity8 failed to claim victory			1
when @entity8 was declared the winner , @entity1 's stache was safe ... but he turned the idea into gold for a good cause			1
after raising $ 1 million for epilepsy research , @entity1 appeared on @entity23 's @entity22 in @entity24 on friday and freed his upper lip of the hair that had nested there for 40 years			1
this is a mustache : in october , @entity1 told the @entity22 hosts he would shave his mustache if @entity8 lost the key battleground states of @entity12 , @entity13 or @entity14 in the election now you see it , now you do n't : @entity1 held on to the facial hair since @entity8 was successful in the election but he ultimately ditched the stache for charity when @entity1 put his mustache on the line in an october interview on @entity22 , in the lead up to november 6 , the race to the @entity39 really began to heat up - with many in the media joking the @entity24 native might have to part with his long term accessory			1
morning @entity48 host @entity47 in turn had said he would grow a mustache if @entity51 lost @entity52 or @entity53			0
after @entity8 's re-election , and his victory in @entity52 , @entity1 did n't need to pay up but @entity56 , apparently uncertain of how the new look would suit him , decided to use the publicity to help a good cause			1
@entity1 has a daughter , 31 - year - old @entity60 , who suffers from epilepsy and he decided to launch a fundraising effort in early november to benefit @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , a non-profit that @entity1 's wife , @entity64 , started in 1998			1
in return , @entity56 kicked off the effort with a $ 10,000 donation as part of the ' @entity71 the @entity70 ' campaign			2
the moment of truth : @entity1 was surrounded by his wife @entity64 ( left ) , @entity23 host @entity47 ( second from left ) , @entity75 from @entity76 and host @entity77 ( right ) for the momentous shave faithful friend : @entity1 , 57 , has had the stache for 40 years and said he was up all night preparing to say goodbye to the facial hair over the years : @entity1 's wife @entity64 , left , said the mustache was lighter in shade when they were married in 1979 @entity1 said if he could raise $ 1 million in one month , he would come on @entity22 and shave the mustache			1
in the course of the month , over 2,608 donors pledged $ 1,051,679			0
high profile donors included real estate tycoon @entity90 , who donated $ 100,000 , and @entity92 owner @entity91 , who gave $ 200,000			2
other donors included president @entity8 , @entity94 and @entity95			2
' it took @entity1 's mustache to bring @entity90 and president @entity8 together , ' the hosts joked on friday about the bi-partisan participation			1
with the fundraising mark met - @entity1 said he would make good on his promise			2
' i will keep my part of the bargain and surrender the stache at 7:15 on @ @entity106 ! ' he tweeted late thursday in anticipation of his transformation on friday			0
do not try this at home : morning @entity48 co-host @entity77 stepped in with an electric razor but @entity1 did n't look too sure about her participation saying goodbye : the professionals stepped in , with @entity75 from @entity76 leading the effort cleaning up : the barber also used a straight razor to shave away the hair that has rested on @entity1 's upper lip for 40 years @entity1 was joined by his wife @entity64 and @entity22 hosts @entity56 and @entity77 for the day of reckoning			1
in the lead up to the shave , @entity1 admitted , ' i 'm very attached to it			2
' ' does your mustache have any last requests ? ' @entity47 joked			0
' i was up all night , to be honest with you			0
it â€™s a little unsettling			0
i was up last night talking to it ... it keeps saying ' why , why , why , do we have to do this ? ' he added , though he conceded that the end did justify the means			0
gone but not forgotten : @entity1 prepares to see himself without a mustache for the first time in 40 years did i really just do that ? at first , @entity1 seemed uncertain about his choice satisfied customer : after a few moments getting used to the idea , and with a little encouragement from his wife , @entity1 could n't help but smile @entity1 's wife was on hand for the ordeal			1
the couple married in 1979 , when he was already sporting a mustache , and she has never known him without the facial hair			0
' it was very dark then , ' she said about the state of the stache in his youth , ' it has lightened , ' she added euphemistically about it aging gracefully			0
throughout the chit - chat , @entity1 closed his eyes and braced himself for the inevitable moment , saying he bet his friends at the @entity39 were watching ... ' and laughing			0
' a new man : @entity1 shaved his mustache on friday as part of his campaign to raise $ 1 million for epilepsy research @entity56 offered to help out but @entity1 said he ' was not going to let @entity47 near my neck with a straight razor			1
' a professorial from @entity76 , @entity75 , was on set to do the actual deed			0
the 57 - year - old looked pain as the razor came down and the hair began to fall			2
after the shave , his wife complimented him on his new look and even @entity90 called the show to congratulate @entity1 for his commitment to charity and willingness to go under the razor for a good cause			1
but the suspense continued even after the mustache was gone			0
' @entity187 , stay tuned			0
at 4:30 p.m. on @entity188 , one of @entity191 's remaining mustachioed personalities is going 2 put his whiskers on the line , ' @entity1 tweeted after this appearance on @entity22 about his next media spot			2
