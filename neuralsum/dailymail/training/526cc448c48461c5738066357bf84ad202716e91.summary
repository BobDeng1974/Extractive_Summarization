when opportunity knocked @entity0 paid attention			1
from @entity3 to the @entity5 team and most recently to a desk in his office behind which he sits in his designer knitwear while @entity10 train			1
he 'd rather be out on the grass , he explains , but this interview is keeping him indoors and , when the director of football picks a route through the mud to pose for a photograph , the temptation for some is too much to resist			0
' @entity20 , we 've only won one game , ' yells @entity22 , from the midst of a nearby finishing drill , his verbal arrows more accurate than anything from his feet , as usual			0
@entity0 believes @entity29 kids are made to look mediocre but he thinks they just need an opportunity the former @entity5 international wants to bring the @entity33 spirit back to @entity34 the other players titter and @entity0 laughs along			1
the mood is relaxed ahead of saturday 's game at @entity38 where @entity39 tries to build on victory at @entity41 , the first away points of a difficult campaign , before they fly to @entity44 for a training break			0
' in a short space of time , there 's been a positive turn , ' smiles @entity0			1
' the reaction has been great			0
we want to be a @entity53 side			0
we also know the first year up is the hardest			2
our focus is on staying in this division and everyone to a man is confident of doing it			0
' survival is vital with @entity60 penalties hanging over @entity10 if they slide into the @entity63 and a large part of @entity0 's role is to set down principles to keep the club within its means based around growing their own players			1
@entity0 says @entity10 's @entity53 survival is vital for the club and he 's confident they can do just that @entity0 explains : ' in this country , we 'll buy someone from abroad for £ 20m who has been playing professional football for years and we all go : ' give him a year to 18 months to settle in '			1
' yet we 'll take someone out of the development squad who has never played any senior football in his life and if he 's not a world - beater within two games everyone 's saying : ' well , he 's no good is he '			1
' why not afford the kid the same opportunity ? it 's incredible			0
we 're making @entity29 players and @entity29 coaches appear mediocre and they 're not			1
they 're more than that , given the opportunity			0
' he speaks from experience and with @entity10 in his blood			1
@entity99 signed him from nearby @entity100 for £ 5,000 and sold him a few months later to @entity10 for an initial £ 15,000 , plus another £ 15,000 based on appearances and a 10 per cent sell - on which turned out to be £ 600,000			1
born in @entity103 and raised in @entity104 , he walked by @entity34 every day on his way to @entity106 , now @entity107 in @entity109 's @entity108			0
@entity0 signed for @entity10 from @entity110 and established himself as one of the best in the league the former @entity5 international thinks youngsters should be allowed to settle like the foreign imports ' i was n't a @entity10 fan but they were the only team i saw play live when i was a kid , ' said @entity0			1
' my cousin 's husband brought me to a game against @entity122 when i was 11 and @entity123 saved a penalty			0
' the thing i was most impressed about was that he played in goal with bare hands			0
i stood behind the goal thinking : ' woah , this geezer 's got no gloves on , man ' and i ended up playing in goal at school for three years because of that			0
' with players like @entity33 and @entity137 , they were always associated with entertaining football			1
@entity139 went in and got them promoted and the plastic pitch was in full swing when i joined			0
there was none of this 3g and @entity147 , there were no ' g 's involved at all			0
' the former @entity5 striker revealed he used to play in goal as a youngster after watching @entity123 he lost 4 - 1 at @entity151 , but @entity152 left a big impression			2
' he 'd come from non-league like me , ' said @entity0			1
' he looked so massive and strong and had this aura			0
i was thinking : how do i get to that ? ' his second appearance was worse – a 7 - 1 defeat at @entity161 – before he returned from a year on loan at @entity163 to established himself in a team managed by @entity165			1
they were the top @entity167 club in 1993 , finishing fifth in the inaugural @entity53			0
' @entity10 went out and bought well from the lower divisions and made players better , ' said @entity0			1
' players came through the ranks , like @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			2
people moaned that we sold our best players , but we could n't compete for multi-million pound players			2
' i came when it was acceptable for @entity10 to go and spend £ 30,000 on a non-league player but clubs have stopped doing it			1
the demands are such that if you 're not spending £ 10million on players in every transfer window , you 're not competing and lack ambition			2
his goalscoring record at @entity10 was impressive after 80 goals in just 163 appearances for the @entity167 club @entity193 signed him from @entity10 for £ 6million and he was extremely prolific at @entity194 ' it 's about educating			1
we were n't buying players for £ 3million back then			1
we were selling for that money and for a club like @entity10 this has to be the avenue			1
' years of boardroom instability and managerial chaos seem to have left the club with an identity crisis which @entity0 will address with the backing of owner @entity207			2
' i will look at the long - term future of the club , ' said the director of football			2
' and we will make sure it works			0
my job is not to sign players			2
it 's to work with all areas of management to improve the club			0
' at the heart is youth development and opening pathways to the first - team			2
' i 'm not saying our first - team is going to be full of 21 - year - olds , ' he said			1
' you need experienced heads			0
when i came here i had the likes of @entity230 and @entity231 to help me			0
@entity165 and @entity0 after his move to @entity233 from @entity193 in 1998 ' but we need to attract youngsters here by giving them the opportunity in the first - team			1
that has to be our selling point			0
with respect , if you go to @entity241 and some of the bigger clubs , you 're not getting a chance to play in the first - team unless you 're the most exceptional of the exceptional			2
' @entity0 and @entity39 were previously employed at @entity233 as part of a coaching team responsible for nurturing @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251			1
' all of a sudden the conveyer belt has started , ' he said , and the desire to strengthen the same @entity233 connection at @entity34 prompted @entity0 to recommend @entity255 for the job when @entity257 quit			1
@entity255 ( centre ) was recommended for the @entity10 post by @entity0 , but he opted for @entity260 ' it is my remit is to bring people in who will progress the club , ' said @entity0			1
' we 'd done well at @entity233 and i know what he does			2
we 're good friends but i ca n't afford to bring someone in here because he 's my mate			0
' he 's a very good manager but he opted for @entity260 before we really had a chance to sit down and talk and the way things happened we had to act quickly			1
anyone coming in from outside was going to be a gamble			0
' and , as the owner has said , the job is @entity39 's to lose			0
i know what he 's capable of			0
he 's been doing it forever , but he 's never had the opportunity			0
' this is @entity39 's first managerial position and has the tough task of saving @entity10 from relegation			2

@entity0 wants the @entity33 spirit back to @entity10
the former player is a firm believer in the development of @entity29 players
the 48 - year - old started his *career* at the bottom of the footballing *pyramid*
the @entity298 , @entity193 and @entity233 star is determined to keep @entity10 up
@entity0 recommended his ' good friend ' @entity255 for the @entity10 job before he became the new boss of fellow *strugglers* @entity260
