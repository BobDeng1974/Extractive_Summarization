he said the classes gave him the confidence to start stretching himself			2
' i like coming here , ' said @entity7			1
' it ’s made me much more flexible			0
@entity20 has made me stand and i ’ve been breaking wooden boards			2
' when i ’m warming up and @entity20 tells me to stand for 10 seconds , i always increase my targets and i say make it 20			2
' he gets me to recite about how i am calm , i am positive , i am confident in order to control my breathing			0

speaking about @entity7 ’s remarkable journey , mr @entity20 said : ' we are now on the brink of something phenomenal			1
' i really believe @entity7 will be walking in the not too distant future			1
he has the determination , perseverance and spirit to make it happen			0
' when he first came into the academy , he did n’t know if he could do anything , so i taught him some hand techniques			0
he eventually moved on to hand hitting , using nunchucks - a type of martial arts fighting sticks - and board breaking			1
' ' i got him a new tripod frame and he ’s now standing with that			0
' he ’s got strength in his body to stand - the challenge now is overcoming his mind , so that ’s why we ’re using the ancient martial arts methods of mind , body and spirit			1
' i know he can do it - he ’s not giving up			0
' @entity7 with proud parents @entity67 and @entity69			1
the couple did n't think their son would live after the car accident @entity7 was hit by a car when he was a student at the @entity75 in 1986 , which left him in a coma for nine months			1
he spent almost a year in @entity77 and was later transferred to @entity78 to start his rehabilitation			0

' @entity7 's mother @entity67 , 76 , said : ' when he first came home from hospital he could do very little			1
they more or less told us to put him in a home because they said he would be like a vegetable and we would n’t be able to look after him , but i wanted to give it a try			0
' his body has built new brain cells over the years			2
he ’s had to build up the repetition of sending the signal that he wants to stand until it clicks into place			0
' it ’s been a very long and slow process			0
every year he can do something that he could n’t do the last , but it ’s small progress all the same			0

martial arts classes helped to strengthen @entity7 's body
he can now stand unaided and move a few steps
