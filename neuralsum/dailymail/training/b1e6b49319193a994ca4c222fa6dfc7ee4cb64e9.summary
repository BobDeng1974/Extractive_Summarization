by @entity0 for @entity1 people who suffer obsessive compulsive disorder are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia , new research has warned			1
file picture people who suffer obsessive compulsive disorder are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia , new research has today warned			1
and children of parents with @entity11 are also more prone to the mental health illness as they grow up			1
a team of @entity15 scientists found sufferers are more at risk of both schizophrenia and related spectrum disorders			1
the two conditions are distinct but do , at times , overlap , studies have shown			0
to explore the links between the two condition , researchers from @entity24 analysed @entity15 databases involving three million people born between 1955 and 2006			0
they were then followed up from 1995 to 2012			0
the scientists used incidence rate ratios ( irrs ) as a measure the relative risk to establish the potential relationship between the two disorders			0
the findings , published online in @entity37 , found a total of 16,231 people developed schizophrenia and 447 ( 2.75 per cent ) of them had a prior diagnosis of @entity11			2
a total of 30,556 people developed a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and 700 ( 2.29 percent ) of them had a prior @entity11 diagnosis			2
dr @entity48 said : ' we observed a specific association with @entity11			0
' although a psychiatric hospital contact per se increased the risk of developing schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders , a prior diagnosis of @entity11 explained some additional variation in the disease 's susceptibility			2
' other childhood - onset disorders such as attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder , autism and bulimia nervosa did not increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders as much as @entity11 , indicating a specifically strong effect of @entity11 on the disease 's susceptibility			1
' in addition we observed an effect of parental @entity11 on the risk of developing schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders			2
' this effect of parental @entity11 on the risk of developing schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders was not explained by a parental history of other mental disorders leading to psychiatric contact			1
' interestingly the enhanced risk of children with parents diagnosed as having @entity11 developing schizophrenia or a schizophrenia spectrum disorder reported in this study can be considered comparable to the risk of second and third - degree relatives of patients with @entity11 developing @entity11			1
children of parents with @entity11 are also more prone to the mental health illness as they grow up , the @entity15 researchers found			1
file picture ' despite the fact that our results indicate putative overlapping etiological factors of ocd and schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders , they do not necessarily suggest that these disorders should be aggregated into one global diagnosis			0
' however , given these findings and the fact that @entity11 and schizophrenia co-occur with one another at a higher rate than would be expected in the general population , the phenotypes of these disorders are potentially more similar than currently acknowledged			0
' further research is needed to disentangle which genetic and environmental risk factors are truly common to @entity11 and schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders			0

@entity15 study found obsessive compulsive disorder raises the risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia
children of parents with @entity11 also more susceptible to the mental illness
