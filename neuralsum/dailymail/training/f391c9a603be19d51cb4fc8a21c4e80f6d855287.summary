it 's been the dream of millions of youngsters over the decades to sit in the cockpit of a @entity5 shuttle and take the controls while exploring the darkest depths of space			2
but judging by the vast array of gadgets and buttons in these pictures of some of the agency 's flagship spacecraft , it 's little wonder that so few gained the know - how to make that dream a reality			0
these pictures give a rare insight into what life at the controls of @entity5 's three surviving shuttles , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , was like			1
the photos were taken by photographer @entity29			0
in all the programme 's five shuttles - @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity25 -- flew 135 missions , helped construct the @entity63 and inspired generations			1
the @entity61 was destroyed in an accident after take off in 1986 killing all seven crew members , while the @entity60 broke up when re-entering the atmosphere on a mission in 2003 also killing seven astronauts			0
the @entity26 was the first of the three remaining shuttles to be retired in march 2011 , almost 27 years after it was initially launched in august 1984			1
high tech : a vast section of screens show the status of all the key components of the shuttle buttons galore : mission operations and controls are on the left of the flight deck while payload controls are on the right impressive : the photos were taken by @entity29 who was given a rare glimpse inside some of @entity5 's flagship shuttles it flew more missions than any other shuttle , completing 39 flights safely in 27 years , spending the equivalent of almost a full year in space			1
the @entity26 flew the @entity95 into orbit and now sits on display at the @entity98 in the @entity99			0
@entity25 was launched in may 1992 and taken out of service in may 2011			2
explanation : a @entity5 diagram which shows some what some of the controls do it was commissioned to replace the destroyed @entity61 craft and named @entity25 after captain @entity108 's ship following a national schools competition			1
the final shuttle to be retired was @entity27 which launched in october 1985 and landed for the final time in july 2011			0
@entity27 orbited the @entity112 4,848 times and travelled a staggering 126million miles - the equivalent of the distance between the @entity116 and @entity112 525 times over			0
uncomfortable : the interior of the shuttle shows that life in space is a less than comfortable ride dismantled : the mid-deck of the shuttle has lost many of its lockers and storage facilities consigned to history : the @entity25 was powered up for the last time ever just a few weeks after these pictured were taken countdown to retirement : space shuttle @entity26 lifts off from the @entity131 in @entity54 , @entity132 , in february 2011			2
