mankind is on the brink of ' committing suicide on a grand scale ' unless rapid progress is made on green issues , the @entity0 warned today			1
in very strong language , prince @entity7 claimed the planet was doomed to an ' unimaginable future ' if the problems of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere , intensive farming using pesticides and the depletion of natural resources were not addressed			1
the prince , often accused of using his position to influence public policy , is usually tempered when giving his views about the environment			2
letters : prince @entity7 has often written to ministers and @entity42 departments in a swipe at critics of his green views , he said he had once been written off as ' a crank ' , but now his fears for the environment have been backed by scientific evidence			1
his comments came in a pre-recorded video speech accepting a lifetime achievement award at the 7th @entity53 at @entity54 in @entity55			0
he told the ceremony that fossil fuels and supplies of fresh water were under pressure while ' vast amounts of @entity62 ' were still pumped into the atmosphere			0
the @entity0 said : ' @entity64 and the @entity65 will soon begin to suffer some very grim consequence			1
' it ’s therefore an act of suicide on a grand scale to ride so roughshod over those checks and balances and flout nature ’s necessary limits as blatantly as we do			2
“ the longer we go on ignoring what is already happening and denying what will happen in the future , the more profoundly we condemn our grandchildren and their children to an unbearably toxic and unstable existence			2
we simply have to turn the tide			0
' speaking of his early warnings of the environmental threats to the planet he said the lifetime achievement award was an acknowledgement for what he described as his ' rather inadequate efforts ' to create change			0
he added : ' all those years ago when i began to see that this could be so , i found myself labelled with every term that describes a crank			2
“ i do n’t actually recommend it as a pastime but , extraordinary as it may seem , nowadays … that intuitive feeling has been backed up by a mass of scientific evidence in every possible field confirming that our predominant approach is having a very adverse effect on nature			0
' over the years , the @entity0 has courted controversy because of his involvement in public affairs - writing to councils and government ministers with his views ranging from architecture to alternative medicine			1
the government has blocked the release of secret letters @entity0 wrote to ministers because they would ' seriously damage ' his political neutrality and his role as future king			1
the letters were requested under the @entity125 , but yesterday the attorney general stopped the release saying they were ' particularly frank ' and would ' potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality ' if published			0
he added that any suggestion he was ' disagreeing with government policy ' would be ' seriously damaging to his role as future monarch '			2
the @entity135 had previously ruled that two dozen ‘ black spider ’ letters – which @entity7 sent during the last @entity138 government – should be revealed			0
a judge said it was in the public interest to release the letters , which were described in court as ‘ advocacy correspondence ’ through which the @entity0 had sought to influence government policy			1
but yesterday the government ’s chief legal officer overturned the ruling			0
last month the government blocked the release of secret letters prince @entity7 wrote to ministers because they would ' seriously damage ' his political neutrality and his role as future king			2
the letters were requested under the @entity125 , but the attorney general @entity155 stopped the release saying they were ' particularly frank ' and would ' potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality ' if published			0
the @entity135 had previously ruled that two dozen ‘ black spider ’ letters – which @entity7 sent during the last @entity138 government – should be revealed			0
a judge said it was in the public interest to release the letters , which were described in court as ‘ advocacy correspondence ’ through which the @entity0 had sought to influence government policy			1
in 2009 , he was accused of meddling in government policy after it emerged he had written to eight @entity42 departments in three years			0
he sent personal letters to the @entity172 , the @entity173 and the @entity174 – while his aides sent letters to other senior @entity178 members			0
freedom of information requests revealed advisers to the @entity0 pressed ministers to consider his views on matters including hospital building and the design of ecotowns his most public intervention came in 2010 over a £ 3 billion scheme to redevelop the @entity189 by the @entity190			1
the project was axed after the @entity0 lobbied the prime minister of @entity190 claiming it was a ' gigantic experiment with the very soul of our city '			1
dr @entity197 , director of @entity199 ’s @entity198 , told the @entity200 that the @entity0 ’s views were still out of step with mainstream thinking .			1

he claims world is heading towards ' terrifying @entity38 '
future generations facing ' unimaginable future ' if we do *n't* act
