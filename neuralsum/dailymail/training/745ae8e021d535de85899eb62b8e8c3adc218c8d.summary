a school has transformed standards of behaviour after hiring former @entity4 personnel to patrol corridors and eject disruptive pupils from lessons			2
@entity8 in @entity9 deployed a team of three retired naval staff - including an @entity12 - to help enforce consistent discipline and provide boys with positive male role models			1
the former sailors – part of the school ’s pastoral staff – insisted on high standards of behaviour around the school and in the playground and even drove to pupils ’ homes if they failed to turn up in the morning and brought them to lessons			1
plans include giving powers to a new network of commissioners to intervene immediately in failing schools and order changes such as new uniform policies and setting by ability			2
an elite corps of 1,500 expert teachers will also be built up and dispatched around the country to boost under - performing schools			1
mr @entity29 hailed the role of the former military personnel as he toured @entity8 and suggested other schools adopt similar schemes			1
‘ i was delighted to meet the former @entity4 personnel who have made such a difference to behaviour and discipline at the @entity8 in @entity9			1
they have played a key role in the dramatic turnaround at this school under their brilliant head teacher @entity60 , ’ he said			0
the comprehensive has transformed standards of behaviour after hiring former @entity4 personnel to patrol corridors and eject disruptive pupils from lessons ‘ at the heart of our reforms , we want to give head teachers the freedom to make the decisions that will improve standards in their school - and this is a perfect example			1
’ the ex-naval staff were brought in by @entity60 after she became the academy ’ s first head five years ago			1
the school had long been in the doldrums in its previous incarnation - @entity81 ’ s @entity83 – regularly achieving some of the worst exam results in the country			2
@entity60 – ennobled in 2000 for turning round struggling schools – began by tackling poor behaviour and attendance			0
this included drawing on @entity9 ’s naval links to build a team of school pastoral support workers			1
their responsibilities included driving a school car to the homes of youngsters who had failed to turn up for classes – assuming no good reason had been given – and insisting they get out of bed and come to school			2
prime minister @entity29 accompanied by education secretary @entity103 are met by head girl @entity104 , 15 , and deputy head boy @entity105 , 15 they also checked behaviour in corridors and removed pupils from lessons if they were seriously misbehaving			2
another of their key roles was standing at the school gates and ensuring pupils were behaving well before entering the premises			0
‘ they were really useful members of staff because they were non-confrontational but have great personal presence and were very very good at being consistent about implementing our school policies , ’ said @entity60			2
‘ they also presented very positive male role models to the students and of course many of our students do n’t have positive male role models in their lives			0
’ she added : ‘ the @entity4 is a very valuable source of personnel			0
most of them retire from the @entity4 in their early forties			0
’ behaviour among pupils at @entity81 ’s had previously been so poor other schools had resisted using its pool facilities			1
‘ when i asked them why , they said that when they had used it in the past , the children used to throw chairs at them out of the third floor window and spit at them , ’ said @entity60			0
following the introduction of a tough new disciplinary code backed up by the pastoral support workers , behaviour steadily improved			0
@entity8 in @entity9 deployed a team of three retired naval staff - including an @entity12 - to help enforce consistent discipline and provide boys with positive male role models the school also emerged last year as the second most improved in the country and the best - performing in @entity9 with 68 per cent of pupils achieving a set of five good gcses including @entity159 and maths			1
other measures adopted by the academy - motto ‘ work hard , be nice and no excuses ’ – include a strict new dress code with traditional blazers and a house system			1
teachers also drew on methods used in @entity169 to boost maths teaching while primary school specialists were brought in to help pupils with very low reading ages			1
the techniques are among those that may be introduced more widely under mr @entity29 ’s plan to give regional school commissioners strong powers to intervene directly in schools judged as failing by @entity181			0
they will be able to sack heads and bring in new governing bodies as well as introducing new policies on classroom discipline , school uniform and homework			0
schools may also become academies under the control of outside sponsors with a remit to drive up standards			2
but the reforms provoked consternation among heads who feared their jobs would become vulnerable			0
@entity200 , general secretary of the @entity201 , said : ‘ here we see the first reverberations of @entity204 on education policy			0
today 's announcement may make good politics to some but it makes lousy school improvement			0
