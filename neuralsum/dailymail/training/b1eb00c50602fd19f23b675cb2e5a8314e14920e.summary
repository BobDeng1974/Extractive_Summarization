by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:46 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 12:37 est , 14 march 2014 the crisis in @entity4 ' would have been different ' if @entity5 had been elected president , according to a former @entity9 @entity8 governor			1
president @entity10 , said @entity11 , is sacrificing @entity1 's national security on the altar of rank partisanship , blaming @entity9 - led cuts in the rate of spending growth for new limits on @entity1 's involvement abroad			1
' he 's satisfying himself with " well , i have to scale back our safety because of you , because of your sequester , " ' @entity11 told @entity25 , referring to a series of @entity28 budget cuts put in place as a dicey solution to a congressional budget stalemate in 2012			1
that 's not national leadership			0
he seems to be using partisanship as his excuse for a reduction of our national security and safety			0
former governor of @entity8 , briefly ran for president himself in 2007 , but now dishes out criticism about the @entity47 's current occupant would @entity48 have flinched ? @entity11 says @entity9 presidential candidate @entity5 's more aggressive foreign policy would likely have made the @entity51 president sit on his hands instead of invading @entity4 @entity11 was @entity8 's governor from 1998 to 2002 and now runs the @entity53 , a conservative think tank that pushes for aggressive @entity1 foreign policy			1
he told @entity25 on friday at the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 that @entity10 ' does n't have a vision for the big - picture safety and security of this country			1
' ' he should have reversed course ' after @entity51 president @entity48 invaded @entity4 , @entity11 insisted			1
if @entity10 had lost his re-election bid to former @entity64 gov. @entity5 , he said , @entity48 would have been less bold			1
' in all probability it would have been different ' with @entity5 in charge , @entity11 told @entity25 , since @entity10 is n't believable overseas			1
' he does n't seem to have the experience himself , because of his background â € “ his limited time in the @entity75 , his previous background in @entity69 , ' he said			0
' that does n't give him any foreign policy experience			2
' ' moral authority and military power is necessary to preserve our security in the 21st century			0
perhaps gov. @entity5 would have done that better			0
' a spokesperson for the @entity47 's @entity84 responded to @entity11 's comments by referring @entity25 to interviews deputy national security adviser @entity82 gave sunday on @entity87 and @entity88			2
@entity11 , no longer seeking any office , has become a @entity9 firebrand with a sharp tongue on foreign policy @entity4 has sought urgent @entity94 backing after @entity51 president @entity48 is insisting that @entity95 had the right to join his country even while shock troops have maintained a grip on the region 's borders @entity48 , fresh off the global luster of a successful @entity103 , has seized international attention by marching across @entity51 's western border , apparently not fearing a robust @entity1 response @entity82 said on @entity88 that @entity48 ' is not acting out of a position of strength			1
he 's acting out of a position of weakness , ' and claimed ' the international community [ is ] mobilized against the actions [ @entity48 ] has taken as a result of the president 's leadership			2
' on @entity87 he added that the ' result of the mobilized support is that the financial markets in @entity51 have hit lows , the ruble has hit a low			0
investors are wondering whether to get involved in @entity51 because of the instability			0
and all of that is exacting a real cost and a real consequence			0
' @entity11 said the @entity1 should continue to press @entity51 with economic sanctions , but do a better job of protecting @entity129 countries that want to change their courses			1
' we need to recognize that @entity129 wants to be @entity94 , and it 's our duty to engage them as publicly as we can , ' he explained , ' and make sure that everyone understands that we 're drawing a line here			0
@entity10 says he 's drawing lines , of course , but they do n't seem to mean much			2
' ' what 's driving him seems to be this idea that we have to pull back and pull back and pull back , ' @entity11 said			0
' our friends in the @entity146 , our friends in @entity129 and @entity144 , they do n't want to see that			2
they still count on a robust @entity1 to lead the world			0

@entity11 told @entity25 that the president is blaming @entity9 - led cuts in the growth of government spending for a *lax* foreign policy
he suggested if @entity10 had lost his 2012 re-election bid , @entity51 's @entity48 would have *approached* a president @entity5 with more fear
@entity144 , the @entity146 and the rest of @entity129 , said @entity11 , wants to see a strong @entity1 as a *disincentive* to @entity51 and other aggressive states
@entity10 ' does n't seem to have the experience himself , because of his background , ' to run an *effective* foreign policy , he said ,
