by @entity1 reporter published : 14:24 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 15:25 est , 3 august 2013 organizers of a new event planned for several @entity5 cities plan to unleash bulls to sprint through fenced - in courses as daredevils try to avoid being trampled			1
the @entity9 is inspired by the annual running of the bulls in @entity12 , @entity13			1
it 's set to kick off august 24 at a drag - racing strip south of @entity15 , @entity16			1
a second event is planned for october 19 at an @entity19 - area horse park that hosted events for the @entity21			0
give chase : one company is organizing running of the bulls events all over the @entity5 to give @entity5 a taste for the @entity13 tradition run wild : @entity9 events will be taking place later this month , and continue with one event almost every month more events are planned later for @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity39 runs - when the animals are released to run alongside participants as spectators cheer - are common in @entity13 and can drum up controversy			2
injuries often occur , as do deaths , though they are much rarer			0
some groups attack the treatment of the bulls used in the runs			0
about 5,000 people have signed up to participate in the @entity16 event , and the number grows by about 50 each day , said @entity53 , co-founder and chief operating officer of @entity55			1
and with 2,000 signed up for the @entity57 , @entity58 , event , @entity53 expects 5,000 to 7,000 to run there in october			2
the @entity5 events will last one day each , unlike the annual weeklong festival in @entity12 , when bull runs are held every morning			1
author @entity63 wrote about the festival in his 1926 novel @entity66 , which helped it gain worldwide notoriety and attract spectators from around the globe			0
organizers acknowledge that the @entity9 is likely to start out on a smaller scale than its @entity13 counterpart			1
@entity13 tradition : the @entity74 happens every year at the @entity75 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
every morning bulls are released onto the street and brave men and women run to escape being gored but they note that other physically challenging activities such as extreme off - road runs and obstacle races have become increasingly popular in the @entity5 , and they see bull running as a natural follow - up			2
' i think it 's just a progression where we are becoming more and more active as a society , ' @entity53 said			0
' there 's this fitness craze that started with running			0
i think this is just an extension of all that , but making it more interesting to the general public			0
' dozens of people are injured each year in the @entity99 at @entity12 , most by tripping and falling			1
bulls have killed 15 people since record - keeping began in 1924			2
food fight : the bull running events will also be coupled with a tomato royale - another @entity13 tradition of fighting in the streets with tomatoes last month in @entity13 , a @entity111 college student and an @entity113 woman were gored by bulls			2
during one run , participants and spectators screamed as a bull tossed a spaniard to the ground and attacked him , with fellow runners trying to pull the animal away by its tail			2
the man was eventually dragged to safety			0
organizers of the @entity5 events plan to include several safety features , making them ' quite different than the running of the bulls in @entity13 , ' @entity53 said			1
unlike the narrow , cobblestone streets of the @entity13 runs , the @entity5 events will use fencing that will include coves , or notches , so participants can get out of the way quickly			1
safer : the @entity5 organizers are putting certain systems in place to make their events much safer than the running in @entity12 @entity53 said organizers are partnering with ranches who will supply the bulls , and veterinarians will monitor their health			1
2013 august 24 : @entity150 , @entity151 october 19 : @entity57 , @entity58 december 7 : @entity152 , @entity33 2014 february 1 : @entity153 , @entity34 march 8 : @entity154 , @entity35 april 5 : @entity155 , @entity33 may 10 : @entity156 , @entity36 june 7 : @entity157 , @entity38 june 21 : @entity158 , @entity35 july 12 : @entity159 , @entity37 ' we 're not using the @entity13 fighting bulls that are bred to be very aggressive for the entertaining aspect of bullfighting , ' @entity53 said			1
@entity39 will be released in waves of six at a time , giving the animals and people a ' better opportunity to complete the course safely , ' @entity53 said			0
before running , participants will be required to sign waivers			0
@entity53 , an attorney , acknowledges that waivers wo n't prevent lawsuits but likened it to sky - diving or operating a rock - climbing wall : ' the waivers for the most part ensure that even if you get sued , they 're not going to win			0
' researchers are still trying to figure out why some people are drawn to potentially dangerous activities			0
one theory is that some people get a surge from routine activities , but others need more thrilling or exciting behaviors to get the same feeling , said dr. @entity189 , assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the @entity191			0
' to get that same sort of euphoric feeling that you feel at the end of a jog , they may need to jog with bulls for example , ' @entity189 said			0
organizers say they 're planning each of @entity5 events as an all - day experience , with plenty of activities such as a tomato fight , also modeled after a @entity13 festival			1
but they hope the bull runs draw participants who have always wanted to participate but could n't make the trip to @entity13			2
' you can go running down the street anytime you want , but to run with bulls - that 's something that does n't come along very often , ' @entity53 said .			0

the @entity9 will happen at several @entity5 cities starting august 24 in @entity15 , @entity16
the event is modeled off the annual @entity74 in @entity12 , @entity13 during the festival of @entity99
the tradition is extremely dangerous will people getting gored and even killed *regularly*
the event organizers are *changing* parts of the run to make it safer for @entity5 participants
