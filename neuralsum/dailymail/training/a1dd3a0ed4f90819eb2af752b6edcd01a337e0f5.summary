it is the greatest show in golf – and by the time the @entity3 gets into full swing this week , @entity2 will have spent 13 years and £ 20million on staging its finest hour			1
as the eyes of the sporting world fix firmly on this jewel of the @entity15 countryside , experts predict a flood of golf - mad tourists will pump more than £ 100million into the national economy as they flock to watch the world ’s top golfers do battle			1
residents in nearby @entity21 are determined to get their slice of the action when 250,000 fans arrive for the biennial clash between @entity26 and the @entity27			1
over here : the @entity27 @entity3 team arriving at @entity30 yesterday before heading to @entity2 hotels and guest houses for miles around have long since booked out , while many enterprising locals have rented out their homes for five - figure sums			1
even a week ’s stay in a caravan park could set visitors back £ 1,400			1
yet , as the first fans descend by bus and train at the @entity42 today for the first of the main practice rounds , police and locals are bracing themselves for possible travel chaos as roads surrounding @entity2 are subject to a major programme of closures and restrictions			1
about 45,000 spectators are expected every day as @entity27 captain @entity54 ’s stars take on @entity56 ’s @entity26 team this weekend			2
the event will put @entity58 in the world ’s shop window , as an estimated 500million viewers in 183 countries watch on tv			1
@entity64 and the finest @entity58 produce will be on sale at the huge temporary hospitality village that has grown up at the entrance to the @entity42			1
head start : no need to ask which team golfer @entity71 will be playing for with golf tourism already worth £ 220million annually to the @entity58 economy and supporting 4,400 jobs , hosting the 40th @entity3 is expected to make 2014 a bumper year for the home of golf			1
although the course is only a short drive from @entity21 ’s @entity80 – the 1½ - mile main thoroughfare which gives the @entity82 its nickname – the event has been secured behind a ring of steel fences			1
some retailers fear the tight travel restrictions which will see most spectators bussed straight to the course may mean their shops and cafes are bypassed			2
@entity92 , golf business manager at @entity2 , admitted the @entity3 had raised mixed emotions among locals : ‘ some people will be very happy because their local shops and restaurants will be busy			1
but others may feel that our quiet little town has been taken over			0
’ the busy @entity100 has been reduced to a single lane in each direction , with the inside lane part of an extensive park - and - ride scheme			2
police have urged motorists to consider avoiding the area to reduce the inevitable delays			0
residents have at least been spared a controversial parking ban in the centre of @entity21 , after @entity112 and @entity113 accepted at the last minute that it was unnecessary – although the traffic order will remain active and can be implemented if required			1
@entity3 @entity26 operations director @entity118 said : ‘ although there will be many benefits to staging the @entity121 in @entity58 , particularly for the @entity15 region , putting on a sporting event of this scale , with 45,000 people expected each day , will inevitably mean some inconvenience to local residents			1
’ while @entity2 ’s 232 rooms , including 26 luxury suites , have been reserved for the two teams , match officials and dignitaries , hundreds of enterprising locals have decided to give the travel chaos a miss and make a killing by renting out their homes – ranging from small flats to lavish family mansions – through estate agents and specialist golf websites			1
child ’s play : youngsters at the @entity3 fan zone in @entity30 yesterday as the first day begins all smiles : @entity27 golfstar @entity145 and his wife @entity146 arrive at @entity30 ahead of the @entity3 one four - bed room detached villa , situated in a typical middle - class estate but within walking distance of the course , was snapped up last year for £ 27,500 for a single week			1
other rental businesses are also set to cash in			0
@entity153 , owner of @entity155 caravan park , has leased or sold 30 luxury lodges in the run - up to the tournament			2
he said that lodges that used to cost £ 650 - £ 950 per week to rent have now rocketed ten-fold			1
mr @entity153 is currently charging £ 195 a night to park a caravan , compared to only £ 19.50 a year ago			0
he said : ‘ we have 30 lodges here but we ’re looking to build another 29			0
‘ we have been fully booked since march			0
people are coming from @entity164 and @entity27			0
i ’m not surprised at all the interest			0
everybody ’s desperate to be part of a once - in - a - lifetime experience			1
hail to the chief : @entity54 and wife @entity170 arrived with the rest of the team ahead of the games ‘ we ’ve actually sold 14 lodges so far this year , compared to six or seven last year			0
people are buying them and renting them out themselves for the @entity3			2
’ golf fans lucky enough to have secured a ticket have been warned that there is no ‘ walk - on ’ access to the course and that everyone – even those staying locally – will be required to use the shuttle buses and park - and - ride schemes which have been set up to minimise disruption to locals			1
those arriving by train will be able to make use of a temporary bridge that will straddle the a9 and take fans straight to the site			0
not everyone is up for a golf extravaganza on the streets of @entity21 , which borders the @entity2 and golf courses , there are mixed feelings about the @entity3			1
@entity202 , 35 , owner of café @entity203 , fears the promised tourism bonanza may fail to materialise as most golf fans will be bussed straight to the course and bypass the @entity15 town			1
he said : ‘ i ’m slightly worried people will go into @entity2 and that will be them there all day			0
‘ however , i ’m expecting a good influx of tourists and i ’ve doubled the number of staff for this week			0
’ @entity215 , 22 , who works at the @entity216 off licence , said it had laid on a special free delivery service to local addresses until the @entity3 finishes on sunday			2
welcome : but how many golf fans will actually visit @entity21 this week ? residents are worried it could fail she added : ‘ we ’ve dropped them at holiday lodges and taken quite large deliveries			2
we ’ve never done it before but a lot of people have relatives staying for the golf – so there ’s a market for it			2
’ @entity236 , who has been the manager of @entity237 for ten years , said : ‘ we ’ve seen a steady increase in business and in the last three weeks it ’s gone up by 25 per cent			0
it ’s great for the town because although @entity2 is on the map , @entity21 is n’t			0
’ local shoe shop owner @entity244 said : ‘ the school has benefited because the team captains have been down and handed out some tickets to the pupils			0
businesses have a lot to offer here , so it ’s a shame they ’re being bussed in and away again			0
’ another resident , who owns a fast food outlet but declined to give her name , also fears the tourist boost has been exaggerated			0
she said : ‘ we ’ve had extra trade from workers at @entity2 but when it starts i think it ’ll be really quiet			0
’ she also voiced concern that a footbridge built over the @entity100 at a notorious accident blackspot to link @entity2 railway station to the hotel was only temporary			0
she said : ‘ that ’ll get taken down when the @entity3 finishes			2
so it ’s ok for us to be knocked down but not tourists			2
’ where it will all happen : the 18th green of the @entity42 at @entity2 in @entity15 but @entity274 , owner of ladies ’ fashion shop @entity272 , was an enthusiastic supporter of the whole @entity3 extravaganza , saying : ‘ you ’ve got to embrace it			1
’ @entity279 and @entity280 , who own the @entity281 , accepted that local residents are likely to face delays and inconvenience			0
but mr @entity285 said : ‘ even if it takes three hours to get here because of the road closures , so what ? it ’s fantastic for the town			0
‘ my restaurant is three times busier , my staff are doing extra hours and i ’ve recently built a beer garden and refurbished parts of the hotel			0
‘ @entity54 ’s family have booked out the hotel			2
