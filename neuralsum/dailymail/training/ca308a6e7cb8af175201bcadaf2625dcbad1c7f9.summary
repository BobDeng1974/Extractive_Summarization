by @entity0 published : 19:23 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 19:24 est , 25 october 2013 the lives of one out of two @entity3 are so hectic they never have time for a lie - in , according to a survey			1
more men than women - 49 per cent compared with 41 per cent - complained they do n’t have lazy mornings			0
with the prospect of an extra hour in bed when the clocks go back this weekend , the poll found that only a quarter ‘ regularly ’ or ‘ always ’ sleep through the night			1
@entity15 : 49 per cent of women surveyed complained that they do n't have lazy mornings when asked how often they had a lie - in , 44 per cent of those polled said they ' never ' enjoyed one			0
people in @entity22 have the most lie - ins , followed by the @entity24 and @entity25 , while those in the @entity27 have the fewest			2
parents may not be surprised to hear that people aged 16 to 24 have more lie - ins than other age group while those aged 55 and over miss out the most			0
although many @entity3 would like more sleep , 48 per cent said they were unwilling to give up anything to spend longer in bed			1
just nine per cent said they were prepared to spend less time with friends , four per cent less time with loved ones and two per cent less time with their children			0
one in five would sacrifice watching their favourite tv shows , 15 per cent ' pampering ' time and 3 per cent part of their salary for extra sleep			1
troubled : the survey of more than 2,000 people suggested that quality of sleep is an issue for many the survey of 2,044 @entity3 adults also suggests that quality of sleep is an issue for many , with just a quarter either either ' regularly ' or ' always ' sleeping through the night			1
in contrast , 42 per cent wake in the middle of the night , 30 per cent toss and turn most nights and 29 percent take a long time to nod off			0
furthermore , almost a quarter said they tended to wake too early			0
but it seems people still turn to traditional methods when they need to get to sleep			2
reading a book was the most popular choice , followed by listening to music and herbal remedies , while counting sheep was fifth			0
twice as many men ( 31 per cent ) than women ( 16 per cent ) said they never did anything to help them drop off at night			0
dr @entity79 , @entity81 ’s sleep expert and a sleep therapist at @entity83 , said : ' many people are simply too busy these days to enjoy a lie in , so it ’s hardly surprising that almost half of us never get to treat ourselves			1
' although a good night ’s sleep is clearly a problem for many people , only a minority are prepared to sacrifice doing other things to get it , whether that ’s spending time with people close to them or even watching their favourite tv shows			1
' but sleep deprivation can have a huge impact on people ’s lives so it ’s important they evaluate their lifestyle to ensure they are not burning the candle at both ends - getting enough sleep is important for everyone ’s well - being			2

survey of more than 2,000 people found @entity3 yearn for more sleep
but only a small minority would sacrifice other *pastimes* or work to get it
@entity81 study also found quality of sleep is an issue for many of us
