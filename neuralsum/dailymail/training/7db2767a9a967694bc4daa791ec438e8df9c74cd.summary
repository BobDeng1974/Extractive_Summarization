' i was wearing a thin hospital gown - one of those that you tie at the back - and my slippers			2
i was also on crutches			0
it stunned me that they thought it was fine to discharge me like that and when they told me they ’d call for a taxi , i was speechless			0
' i was still in a lot of pain and i felt they just wanted to get rid of me , like i was too much trouble			0
