security firm @entity0 has advertised for a cleaning supervisor who can speak @entity2 so they can ' communicate with other members of staff '			1
the private contractors said candidates who speak both @entity8 and @entity2 would be preferred for the vacancy at @entity10			1
in the advert , which was posted on its website , @entity0 wrote : ' candidate who can speak both @entity8 and @entity2 is preferred to be able to communicate with the other members of staff			1
the advert offers £ 7.50 per hour - £ 1 more than the minimum wage - for the part - time role			1
a stated ' preference ' on a job advert is not against employment laws because it can be argued that the preference does not stop those without the quality from applying			2
but the advert - which has been branded as ' discriminatory ' by one politician - could raise questions over how common it is for low - skilled workers to be required to speak a foreign language			1
the advert for the vacancy in @entity45 came to light after a constituent complained to @entity48 , the @entity49 parliamentary candidate for @entity45 and @entity50 , that he felt the advert was discriminatory against those who only speak @entity8			1
mr @entity48 told @entity53 : ' this man was an experienced cleaner and thought it would be the perfect job for him			0
but he has decided not to apply for it - because he feels he will never get the job			0
' what it says to me is that @entity0 is happy to employ people who can not speak very good @entity63 , meaning they then have to employ a supervisor who speaks @entity2			1
' it is discriminating against those who only speak @entity8			1
they are saying someone without having @entity2 as a language can apply - but who is going to ? last time i checked , @entity45 was an @entity8 - speaking part of the world and that should not be the case			1
' he added : ' i think @entity0 do , in the future , need to look at how they advertise jobs			1
i think the @entity79 should also look at how its supplier is advertising for jobs			0
' it is an issue that needs flagging up			0
@entity49 is not afraid of political correctness			1
' a spokesman for the @entity87 union , which counts thousands of cleaners among its 700,000 members , said : ' @entity87 does not like stipulations like this that discriminate against workers			2
' if there are practical communications difficulties in any workplace employers should offer the option of @entity63 training support to existing and prospective employees			0
' the union is currently in a legal wrangle in @entity101 over a case in which a worker was allegedly not given an interview for a job on the grounds he could not speak @entity107			2
the advert also says that successful applicants must have a gcse or equivalent in @entity8 @entity87 is representing @entity111 , from @entity112 , who applied for a job as an overhead electricity power linesman in 2009			1
the job notice specified that knowledge of @entity107 was a preferred requirement			0
mr @entity111 did not speak @entity107 and was not invited to interview			2
@entity87 has taken the case to court , claiming it was discriminatory for the firm to request that @entity107 was preferred			0
meanwhile , @entity123 general secretary @entity122 said the furore highlighted the value of equality legislation			0
she said : ' a case like this highlights the value of equality legislation , but if it ’s scrapped then a candidate who believes they have been the victim of discrimination would not be able to do anything about it			0
' a @entity0 spokeman said : ' @entity137 is required for this role , other languages are desirable but not essential			1
' as with any role , we are looking for the best people with a variety of skillsets			1
' should any candidate feel that they are suitable for a role , we 'd encourage them to apply and engage with the relevant resourcing representative			2
' the @entity150 - based group became unpopular with ministers after it overcharged the government for tagging criminals			0
earlier this year , the embattled firm agreed to repay more than £ 130m following an audit showing that taxpayers had been routinely charged for tags on criminals who were in jail , living abroad or even dead			0
costs of cleaning up the scandal helped pushed the company - a member of the @entity164 - to an annual loss			0
the controversy came after a string of other blunders by the firm			0
in 2011 , @entity0 staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over @entity172 and put an electronic tag on a criminal 's artificial limb			2
a year later , the firm failed to train enough guards for the @entity177 which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave			0
and in march 2013 , a @entity0 guard at @entity181 ordered @entity183 engineer @entity182 to change out of her uniform before flying to the @entity185 because it was ' offensive ' .			2

the contractors would prefer candidates who can speak @entity8 and @entity2
the advert offers £ 7.50 per hour for the role at @entity10
it also says the candidate will also have a gcse or equivalent in @entity8
@entity0 said : ' we are looking for the best people with a variety of skillsets '
a @entity49 politician and a leading union said the advert could be ' discriminatory '
