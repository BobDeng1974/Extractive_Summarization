by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 06:52 est , 14 august 2012 a cash - strapped council that flies its employees around the world is splashing out on business class flights instead of economy to make sure they are well rested			2
an official report , which has been signed off by @entity7 , claims the extra comfort is needed so staff can perform their duties effectively			1
the rule applies to any flight longer than eight hours as the council said it has a ' duty of care ' to employees and elected members			0
despite the report stating economy tickets should be purchased for flights of less than five hours , if the mayor is part of the trip then travellers are upgraded to business class			0
flights : @entity7 , pictured , say that staff will be upgraded on certain longer flights because they have a ' duty of care ' the revelation comes as @entity29 expose that @entity7 spent more than £ 210,000 on flights from 2009 to 2012			1
of this , £ 62,000 was spent on flights as part of its @entity34 with @entity36 , £ 6,168 was spent flying staff to @entity38 as part of its bid to become a @entity43 host city			1
@entity7 also spent over £ 10,000 on two trips to @entity38 to attend a @entity45 good practice scheme project and £ 8,465 on flights to @entity48 for business development			1
@entity50 , chief executive of the @entity51 , branded the ' jet setting across the globe ' as ' barmy ' and called twinning visits “ self - indulgent ” and unnecessary in the age of video conferencing			0
earlier this year , the council was criticised after spending £ 4,500 to fly councillor @entity58 , then deputy leader , to @entity38 to attend a two - day economic conference			1
expensive : the council has spent more than £ 210,000 in the last three years on flights if he had flown in economy class the flights would only have cost about £ 750			1
people from the city say the money should be better spent			2
@entity67 said : ' the council should not be allowed to get away with that			0
' the 40 - year - old added : ' we are in a recession and the money they are using for business class flights could go elsewhere on services that would be of long - term use			0
' @entity77 , also 40 , said : ' i think it ’s a disgrace as those seats will cost a fortune , but it ’s the council and they are never going to change			0
' the money should be spent on public services like care homes and making more jobs for people			2
' @entity89 , 49 , added : ' that ’s not fair , what is wrong with a standard class flight ? ' the amount of money they would save by just doing that could be put into schools and roads instead of wasting our money			0
' ex-council worker @entity101 , 77 , said : ' i worked for the council for 34 years and i disagree with the way they spend			2
' the council do n’t do their job and never have done			0
they would have meetings but nothing would come from it			0
' they do n’t seem to be interested in @entity7 and do n’t have aspirations for the area			1
' councillor @entity113 , leader of @entity7 , said : ' more than 17,000 people here are employed by foreign companies and we have seen millions of pounds invested here from overseas			1
' as an example , in the financial year 2011/12 , the creation of more than 2,000 new jobs was announced by overseas - owned companies in the city , bringing £ 700million of capital investment into @entity7			1
' the city council continues to attract foreign investment and promote our goods and services abroad			0
' as part of this work , and in the light of the economic climate , the council has been reviewing its policy and guidelines on foreign travel and already implemented a number of the changes			2
' expenditure on foreign travel has been reduced by approximately 40 per cent over the last three financial years			1

@entity7 has spent £ 210,000 in three years on air travel
