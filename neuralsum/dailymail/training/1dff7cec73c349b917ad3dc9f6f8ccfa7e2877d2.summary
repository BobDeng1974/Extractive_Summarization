by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 21:34 est , 25 november 2013 police have now said that they believe the report of a gunman headed towards @entity4 was a hoax			2
the security scare was based on an anonymous call to the @entity9 police department at 9.48am on monday morning , and after hours of searching the campus , police began doubting the veracity of the call			1
police chief @entity14 said that the male caller who said that his roommate was headed towards the @entity18 campus ' sounded like a confused gentleman '			0
lockdown : police were out in force earlier monday after issuing a ' shelter in place ' warning at @entity4 following an anonymous tip about a person with a gun on campus tip : there were no reports of shots fired or injuries and police have since lifted the order , calling the tip a hoax the roommate was allegedly armed with a long gun			1
' we are tracking down the person who made that phone call , ' the chief said during an afternoon press conference , according to the @entity45			0
' i would n't describe his words as clear and concise			0
' less than an hour after the initial call , the university sent out a text blast email and a message on their @entity52 account reporting the sighting of a gunman and issued a ' shelter in place ' warning urging all students and faculty members to remain inside			1
@entity61 teams , @entity9 and campus police responded to the scene			2
the student newspaper , the @entity63 , reported that @entity9 police lieutenant @entity64 confirmed that one man has been arrested but he did not have a gun			2
he is being questioned after being apprehended about two hours after the original warning went out			0
credible threat : police and @entity61 teams took over campus said that there were confirmed sightings of the shooter before later reassessing the situation and questioning the initial report warnings : those who remained - the school is on @entity80 break - on campus were told to go inside and stay away from the windows but now that warning has been lifted two other witnesses told police that they saw a person with a long gun or rifle , though it is not clear where that individual was spotted			1
eventually they began going door - to - door in residence halls , telling students that the officials would slide their ids under the doors and then asked the students to let them into the rooms for a check			1
as of 3.30pm , anyone in @entity99 was given the ok to leave their rooms but @entity102 still has the ' shelter in place ' warning in effect			0
by the early evening , the warning had been completely lifted but police kept streets near campus closed			0
streets near campus have been closed off as the report is investigated			0
the majority of the school 's students are not on campus today as their november break for @entity80 began on saturday			1
the scare came the same day as a detailed report about the @entity120 was released , revealing details about the mentally ill shooter who killed 26 people nearly an hour away from the @entity9 campus almost a year ago .			2
