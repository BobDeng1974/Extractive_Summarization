an eight - year - old @entity2 girls ' room is filled with thousands of roaches , but the pests do n't bug her at all			1
second grader @entity6 , from outside @entity7 , has been taking care of a colony of @entity10 hissing cockroaches for the last five years as her pets			1
she began with a small batch of male cockroaches , but she later decided that she wanted them to breed and brought in females			1
the girl 's mother @entity31 says that her daughter first became interested in creepy crawlies when she was 18 - months old			2
however the invertebrate keeper was shocked when she heard a local news anchor , news on 6 's @entity38 , say that she detested the hissing bugs			1
@entity6 sent a picture to the journalist and invited her to fight her fears and meet her beloved pets			1
the elementary school student keeps her pets in special plastic containers , as well as aquariums with @entity49 linings to keep her prized possessions from escaping and scampering around the house			2
the cockroaches are kept in plastic containers as well as aquariums with @entity49 on the edges so the animals ca n't escape the @entity56 also keep a bearded dragon lizard named @entity58 in case any members of the bug collection , which also includes @entity63 cockroaches , escape			1
@entity10 hissing cockroaches are one of the largest species of roach , and can grow up to three inches in length , according to @entity69			0
males make a hissing sound for mating by expelling air through slits in its stomach , though the bugs also make their namesake noise when they are alarmed			1
the scavengers , active mostly at night , eat fruits and vegetables and can live for as long as five years			2
some states place restrictions on the importation of the roaches because of fear they could become an invasive species in the wild			2
after atomic bombs were dropped on @entity92 in 1945 , rumors spread that only cockroaches survived the blasts			0
to test the popular myth , which was spread during the @entity99 , the team behind @entity97 's mythbusters subjected cockroaches to three levels of radioactive metal cobalt 60			0
they started with a dose of 1,000 radon units ( rads ) which could kill a person in 10 minutes , then upped the dose to 10,000 - the strength of the blast at @entity110 - and 100,000 rads for a handful of unfortunate insects			0
they monitored the cockroaches for 30 days , looking for signs of cellular damage			0
after a month , half of the insects exposed to the lowest dose were alive and 10 per cent of those exposed to 10,000 rads survived			0
the experiment seems to confirm the myth that the insects can survive a nuclear blast , although all those exposed to the highest dose of radiation perished			0
it 's thought the cockroach â€™s ability to survive is because of its simple body and cell cycles , which only renew once a week , leaving radiation few opportunities to attack , compared with humans whose cells are constantly splitting .			0

@entity6 , of @entity7 , @entity2 , has kept roaches for five years
collection began with males , then she decided she wanted them to breed
family keeps a bearded dragon in case any of the bugs escape
