but do not be deceived - as he was actually a known criminal operating in the late 1800s			1
in 1894 the offender was charged with embezzlement and his bizarre police photograph shows him dressed as a knight in armour			2
it remains a mystery as to why he is dressed in such attire			0
the image is one of many compiled by @entity25 police between 1892 and 1922 to help them identify criminals and repeat offenders in the city			1
as well as their rogues ' gallery images other details were noted - such as offenders ' age , physical appearance and of course their crimes			1
fraudsters and tricksters brought to book by police at the time were also convicted and their mug shots added to police files			2
many smartly dressed criminals were convicted of ' false pretences ' - with their apparent respectability helping them lure their prey			1
fraudsters included @entity46 , a mining engineer and @entity48 , a music - hall artist			2
@entity49 , who used the aliases of @entity51 and baron @entity52 was also charged			0
one police file said that in 1911 : ' @entity55 : medium build , dark brown hair and moustache , successively convicted of stealing ducks & fowl ; a pair of boots ; an overcoat ; a fowl ( again ) ; and finally an umbrella ' was sentenced to several months ' hard labour in prison			0
the portraits of @entity25 's criminal history have been put online by @entity71 's @entity70			1
criminals : @entity55 , left , was successively convicted of stealing ducks , boots , and an umbrella , and left fraduster @entity46 , a mining engineer , pictured in his best attire principal archivist @entity78 said : ' people researching their family history are very excited by criminal ancestors			0
