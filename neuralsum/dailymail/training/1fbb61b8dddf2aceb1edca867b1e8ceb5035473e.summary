by @entity0 published : 20:23 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 20:52 est , 30 december 2012 lord @entity1 has attacked sports stars who use @entity3 too much , saying it is linked to ‘ underperformance ’			1
the @entity6 organiser , who has been made a companion of honour in the new year honours list , said he found it ‘ bizarre ’ that athletes spent their time writing banal comments online during competitions instead of concentrating on winning medals			1
speaking to @entity16 , the @entity6 gold medallist said : ‘ i ’ve always found quite a high correlation between people who spend their time in competition texting and tweeting and underperformance			1
correlation between tweet and fail : lord @entity1 said that athletes who spent time on their phones underperformed during the games distracted ? divers @entity27 and @entity29 enjoying a meal in the @entity31 in one of the photos posted online during the games ‘ i just ca n’t imagine why you would want to be doing that when at the most important moment in your career you ’re thinking about telling the world you ’ve just had a haircut or seen a movie			1
’ while he did not refer to anyone , his comments may ring in the ears of @entity45 stars whose promise did not quite live up to the hype			2
diver @entity27 was expected to reach the gold standard			1
but the 18 - year - old , who has more than two million followers on @entity3 , took home only a bronze medal			2
at the height of the @entity54 , @entity27 was tweeting up to nine times a day			1
as well as posting pictures of the @entity31 , he chatted to celebrities such as @entity58 and @entity59 , of pop group @entity60 , and even attempted to drum up a tv appearance on comedy quiz show @entity63 ’s @entity62			2
keen tweeter : @entity27 , who posted this picture of himself to two million followers on @entity3 , ' only ' won a bronze despite being expected to reach a gold criticised : lord @entity1 said @entity69 should stay off their phones during competitions - @entity27 clearly does not agree not deserving of time off ? a picture from @entity27 's @entity3 of himself and fellow athletes relaxing in the @entity6 village on his two competition days in the individual event , august 10 and 11 , @entity27 posted on @entity3 at least 18 times			1
one message read : ‘ competing in the individual prelims tonight at 7pm : ) aaaaaaahhhh ! ! ! ! ’ a later one read : ‘ nap time before the finals ! @entity80 seem unstoppable at the moment ! but anything can happen ! see you on the other side ! ’ his spokesman did not return calls last night			0
before the @entity54 , swimmer @entity90 , who won two gold medals at @entity92 , swore off the internet after cruel taunts about her appearance			0
but it did n’t last long and she tweeted several times during her swimming final on july 29			0
pre-contest post : @entity27 sent this tweet on the evening before the finals team @entity3 : @entity27 , seen being photographed by his teammates during a training session at the @entity102 during the games , tweeted up to nine times a day miss @entity90 , who has more than 300,000 @entity3 followers , posted : ‘ just sneaked into tonights final in 8th place ! ‘ not expecting anything tonight , all i can do is my best :-) thank you for all the support x ’ later she wrote : ‘ @entity113 bronze medal ! ! ! ca n’t believe it ! sooo happy it ’s unreal ! the crowd was incredible ! thank you to everyone , your support is amazing ! ’ her spokesman declined to comment last night			1
thanking supporters : @entity90 tweets after her bronze medal at the @entity120 by comparison , @entity121 , who stayed off @entity3 during the fortnight of the @entity54 because she did not want the distraction , took home gold in the heptathlon			0
@entity1 , who received a life peerage in 2000 for his services to sport , said that during his career he was so focused he did not even notice the people around him			2
he added : ‘ i ’ve walked past my parents			0
i ’ve walked past close friends an hour before a race and not even recognised them or registered			0
‘ so i just find it bizarre that people can be sitting there , figuring out in 140 characters what they would say to the world at that moment			0
just go out and win the bloody race			0
’ during the @entity54 , a number of athletes were criticised for using @entity3 to promote their sponsors ’ products			0
diver @entity29 wrote about her new car , while synchronised swimmer @entity148 tweeted almost daily about her five main sponsors .			2

lord @entity1 said he found a ' high correlation ' between tweeting and underperformance
