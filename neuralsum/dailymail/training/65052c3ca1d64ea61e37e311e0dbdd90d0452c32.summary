senior @entity2 figures are split over whether to prepare for the possibility of a pact – something @entity51 ’s government failed to do in 2010 , making it easier for the @entity3 to reach an agreement with the conservatives			1
@entity55 , the shadow minister for infrastructure , has called publicly for the party to start planning for a deal , but @entity58 , the deputy leader , has dismissed such calls , suggesting it could prevent some @entity3 voters from switching to @entity2			1
