by @entity0 a radical ' snakebot ' that slithers down a patients throat to perform surgery has treated its first patients			2
called the flex , it can go down a patient 's throat without needing incisions to gain access			0
the device this week successfully operated on a human for the first time - raising hopes it could soon become commonplace			1
open wide ! the @entity18 is inserted into the throat to perform operations inside the human body physicians use a joystick to steer the snake around organs and other obstacles after it has entered through the mouth			1
attached to the head is a high - definition camera so the physicians can see where it is going			1
the snake is made of linked segments that enable it to bend while remaining rigid			1
each link mimics the position of the one in front , preventing it from accidentally bumping into something as it moves through the body			1
either side of the camera are ports for small surgical instruments to be attached			2
these can be used to operate in confined spaces of the human body			1
known as the @entity18 , the design is based on research by @entity48 , professor of robotics at @entity50 , @entity51			1
the robot - assisted device is being developed by @entity55 - based company @entity54 surgeons at the @entity57 have now completed the world ’s first robotic - assisted surgical procedures with the @entity54 ’ @entity18			1
the surgical team of prof. @entity61 and prof. @entity62 successfully performed procedures on two patients , which included the ablation of a vocal fold angiectatic polyp and the resection of tongue - based lymphoid tissue ( lingual tonsil )			2
the first patient had a chronic hoarseness induced by a polyp on the vocal fold , and returned home on the same day of the surgery			0
the second patient had severe snoring , and was discharged from the hospital one day after surgery			0
' with other approaches , surgeons sometimes can not achieve the access and visualization that they desire minimally invasively			0
' with the @entity87 , we can more easily access and treat patients with challenging anatomy			0
' the device ( pictured ) will primarily operate in the oropharynx ( the area between your mouth and the top of your throat ) and the endolarynx ( within the larynx )			0
but in the future it could also be used for more complex operations like heart procedures originally the robot had been used to explore @entity106 ’s abandoned @entity105 nuclear power plant			1
but now this flexible endoscopic system will be used to give surgeons access to parts of the human body that are difficult to reach via other methods			1
this will enable more patients to get so - called minimally - invasive treatment , speeding up hospital waiting times			0
‘ the @entity18 is the first robot - assisted flexible endoscopic platform for use during surgical procedures , ’ dr @entity117 , president and ceo of @entity54 , said in a release			1
‘ the system enables surgeons to access and visualise hard - to - read anatomical locations			0
' in addition , the robotic snake can ' deploy specially designed flexible surgical instruments to perform procedures			0

@entity54 is in the process of marketing the device across @entity170 , where it could soon be making its way into hospitals			1
space scientists are planning to use robotic snakes to explore the hostile surface of @entity177			2
a team from the @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181 , is studying how robosnakes could be used to gather samples from hard - to - reach places on the red planet			0
the work is part of a feasibility study by the @entity189 ( @entity189 ) which aims to provide greater mobility during space research than traditional rovers can provide			0
one idea is to use a conventional rover , such as @entity195 , to carry a robotic snake over large distances and then deploy it to places the rover ca n’t access			0
@entity200 's robot consists of 10 identical joint modules , each having two motorised degrees of freedom			0
the modules are covered by passive wheels to give the robot ground friction , which enables it to slither forward over flat surfaces .			0

the robosnake was made by @entity50 and @entity54
it is composed of linked segments that can *navigate* the human body
movements are controlled using an *external* joystick
tools can be attached to its head to grasp or cut body tissue
a *predecessor* was used to explore an abandoned nuclear power plant
