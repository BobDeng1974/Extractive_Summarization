@entity0 plans to ' dig in ' with all at @entity1 in a bid to ensure this year 's formula one world title is not decided by gremlins and good luck			1
after leading the championship standings for all but the @entity7 in may since winning the opener in @entity9 , @entity0 finds himself in the unusual position of being the hunter rather than the hunted			1
retirement from sunday 's @entity13 due to a wiring loom failure in the steering column , combined with @entity17 's win , means @entity0 trails his team - mate by three points going into the final five races			1
@entity0 retired early from the @entity13 due to issues with his car with four technical retirements to their name , @entity1 have incurred three more than @entity25 and @entity26 , two more than @entity27 , and as many as @entity29 - remarkable when you consider the trouble they were in during pre-season			2
throw in a number of other issues such as those suffered by @entity0 in @entity35 , and for @entity17 during qualifying in @entity37 and @entity38 , and you can appreciate the deep concern going forward			1
@entity17 , @entity0 and @entity1 motorsport boss @entity41 have all stated this week the destiny of the title must be decided on track , not via failures			1
@entity0 's race ended when he could not get out of the pit lane due to mechanical problems it is why @entity0 is eager to play his part and help the team leave no stone unturned to ensure he and @entity17 stay trouble - free			1
' there is no reason why we keep having these faults , ' said @entity0			0
' it 's clear that 's the point we need to focus on the most because the performance is there , as we saw again in the race with @entity17 ' car which was strong , so it 's the reliability that needs to be improved			2
' i now want to dig in with the team to try to understand what went wrong			0
' it 's not that i 'll be demanding anything different from what i 've asked and hoped for in the past because they are already focusing a lot on reliability			0
@entity17 won the @entity13 and over took @entity0 in the drivers ' championship ' they are working crazy hours , working hard , but maybe there is a need to review their approach and try to improve in that area			1
' that 's not a demand because the whole team wants the same thing , i want the same thing			0
' everybody is doing the best possible job , but we need to try and improve			0
' following his retirement under the lights of the @entity92 , @entity0 showed what @entity41 described as ' professionalism ' by remaining at the track rather than heading back to his hotel in a huff			0
instead , @entity0 took full advantage of his time out of the car as the remainder of the race unfolded by joining @entity41 and executive technical director @entity103 on the pit wall			2
@entity0 added : ' i decided , rather than leaving , to see if i could pick up anything that might come in useful for the next couple of races			2
' did i learn anything ? of course , i always learn			0
i 've never watched the other car live in a race and now i 've seen the pit wall work together during a race this year , so i got a lot of insights			0
