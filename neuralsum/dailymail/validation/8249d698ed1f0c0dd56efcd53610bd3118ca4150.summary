savers should be stopped from cashing in their pensions until the age of 60 to prevent them running out of money , mps have warned			1
the @entity5 warned that rules allowing people to dip into their pensions from the age of 55 could create ' unrealistic expectations ' about the age at which they can afford to stop work			1
reforms of pensions , which take effect next month , give savers discretion over their pensions from the age of 55 , rising to 57 in 2028			1
government officials warn that allowing people to start dipping into their pension by the time they reach 55 will create unrealistic impressions about when they can afford to stop working but the committee recommended that access to retirement funds should only be granted ' five years before the state pension age '			1
under the proposals , men would not be allowed to withdraw their cash until they were 60 , while women would have to wait until they were 57			2
dame @entity32 , the @entity33 chairman of the committee , said savers would waste the tax breaks provided by the government unless they were forced to wait until their 60s			1
she said : ' our view is that , given the significant tax relief provided to pensions , increased longevity , and the importance of ensuring people do not underestimate the income needed in retirement , the minimum age at which people can access their pension saving , except on ill health grounds , should rise to five years below the state pension age			1
' in the report , mps warned that the government needs to establish a powerful new pensions watchdog to ensure people are not ripped off when they come to access their retirement savings			2
the @entity60 said moves by the coalition to relax the rules on pensions meant it was more important than ever that proper protections were in place			0
it was scathing about the pensions industry saying it had a ' poor record ' when it came to acting in the best interests of savers and needed to rebuild the trust with the public			2
dame @entity32 said savers would waste tax breaks provided by the government unless they were forced to wait until their 60s as a result of reforms announced by chancellor @entity79 in his last budget , from next month savers will no longer be required to buy an annuity - providing a regular annual income - when they cash in their pension pot. the committee said that while the measure had the potential to encourage more retirement saving by making it more attractive , there were also dangers involved			1
' there are also significant risks for individuals from the new freedoms , ' it said			0
' these include : failing to make provision for the whole period of retirement or making decisions resulting in insufficient income in retirement ; and exposure to fraudulent , mis - sold or detrimental financial products			0
' it said that it was ' questionable ' whether @entity75 plans to establish a guidance service , known as @entity110 , were sufficient to offset the potential risks - particularly given the low level of understanding of pension products which had , in turn , given rise to a lack of trust in the industry			2
' this lack of trust has been exacerbated by the pensions industry 's poor record on acting in savers ' best interests when they access their pension pots , particularly in relation to annuities , ' the report said			1
' savers have previously suffered detriment because some providers did not do enough to ensure that they purchased the right annuity product from the right company			2
' pension providers need to do more to save consumers from taking poor decisions , by focusing on consumers ' best interests rather than their own			0
' the committee expressed concern about the ability of the @entity143 to regulate pensions effectively , after it was told by one @entity143 witness that they can not ' stop fools acting like fools '			0
it said that the creation of single regulator specifically for pensions , would ensure that it had a ' clear focus ' on the whole retirement saving process			0
' the case for taking this step is even stronger now , given the greater risks to savers from fraud , and detrimental financial products , which accompany the undoubted advantages of the new flexibilities , ' it said			0
' savers would have clarity on who was responsible for providing guidance and redress , and employers and the pensions industry would have a single body to advise and supervise them			0
' the committee chair , dame @entity32 said : ' savers need to be properly protected from being ripped off in frauds or scams , or suffering financial loss from making the wrong decision about how to use their pension pots			1
' the scale and pace of recent changes in pensions policy have completely changed the retirement saving landscape			0
it is necessary to draw breath and review the extent of the changes and their implications			0

from next month savers will be given control over pension from age 55
dame @entity32 says savers will waste tax breaks if allowed early access
' savers should be forced to wait until five years before state pension age '
