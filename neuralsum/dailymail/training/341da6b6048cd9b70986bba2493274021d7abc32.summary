by @entity0 @entity1 may have had an extra-terrestrial supply of vitamin b3 delivered by carbon - rich meteorites			1
this is according to @entity7 - funded scientists who have been exploring the potential mix of ingredients brought to the planet from space			1
the study supports the theory that life on @entity1 may have been kick - started by a supply of molecules created in space which hitched a ride to the planet on meteorites			1
@entity21 crushing meteorites with a mortar and pestle in @entity26 's @entity25 to prepare them for analysis			0
@entity3 was found in all eight meteorites analysed in the study while scientists are n't yet sure exactly how these ingredients were cooked up , they predict radiation - blasted ice powered the chemical reactions that produced vitamin @entity3			1
‘ @entity3 , also called nicotinic acid or niacin , is a precursor to @entity38 ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ) , which is essential to metabolism and likely very ancient in origin , ’ said @entity21 of @entity35			0
this is n’t the first time @entity3 has been found in meteorites			1
in 2001 a team led by @entity46 of @entity47 discovered it in the @entity50 meteorite			0
residue from a laboratory experiment simulating the conditions of interstellar space			0
the residue contained @entity3 ( and related compounds ) and may help explain meteorite chemistry a similar study last year found that the building blocks of life can spring into existence spontaneously when icy comets smash into planets			2
scientists believe that about the time life first emerged , between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years ago , @entity1 was being bombarded by comets and meteorites			2
writing in the journal @entity70 , @entity68 scientists show how when a comet impacts it creates a shock wave that generates the molecules needed for amino acids			0
heat from the impact then transforms these molecules into the protein building blocks			0
the scientists point out that abundant ice on the surfaces of @entity83 and @entity84 , two moons orbiting @entity86 and @entity87 , could provide the perfect conditions for producing amino acids from meteor impacts			0
in the new work at @entity26 's @entity25 , dr @entity21 and her team analysed samples from eight different carbon - rich meteorites and found vitamin @entity3 at levels ranging from about 30 to 600 parts - per - billion			1
‘ we discovered a pattern – less @entity3 ( and other pyridine carboxylic acids ) was found in meteorites that came from asteroids that were more altered by liquid water , ’ she said			1
‘ one possibility may be that these molecules were destroyed during the prolonged contact with liquid water			0
asteroids and comets are considered more or less pristine remnants from our solar system 's formation , and many meteorites are prized samples from asteroids that happen to be conveniently delivered to @entity1			2
when asteroids collide with meteoroids or other asteroids , pieces break off and some of them eventually make their way to @entity1 as meteorites although meteorites are valued samples from asteroids , they are rarely recovered immediately after they fall to @entity1			2
this leaves them vulnerable to contamination from terrestrial chemistry and life			0
but the team doubts the vitamin b3 and other molecules found in their meteorites came from terrestrial life			1
@entity1 may have had an extra-terrestrial supply of vitamin b3 delivered by carbon - rich meteorites this is because the vitamin b3 was found along with its structural isomers – related molecules that have the same chemical formula but whose atoms are attached in a different order			1
these other molecules are n't used by life			0
if contamination from terrestrial life was the source of the vitamin b3 in the meteorites , then only the vitamin should have been found , not the other , related molecules			2
the amount of vitamin b3 found was also related to how much the parent asteroids had been altered by water			0
scientists claim this correlation with conditions on the asteroids would be unlikely if the vitamin came from contamination on @entity1			0
the team plans to conduct more interstellar chemistry experiments under more realistic conditions to better understand how vitamin @entity3 can form on ice grains in space			1
‘ we want to add water ice ( the dominant component of interstellar ices ) and start from simpler organic precursors ( building - block molecules ) of vitamin @entity3 to help verify our result , ’ said dr @entity21 .			1

@entity7 predicts radiation - blasted ice produced @entity3 on meteors
the team found @entity3 when analysing 8 different carbon - rich meteorites
they have ruled out the possibility that the vitamin contaminated the meteorites after they hit @entity1
