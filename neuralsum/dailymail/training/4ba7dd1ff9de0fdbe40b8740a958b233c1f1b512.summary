the new waxwork figure of @entity1 , which has gone on display at the @entity3 in @entity4 her face may not be as familiar as her books , but that could soon change			1
this waxwork shows what @entity1 may have looked like – according to a former @entity11 forensic artist who helped make it			1
the @entity14 author never sat for an official portrait – she was sketched only once , by her sister @entity16 in 1810 – so the @entity3 in @entity4 , asked painter and researcher @entity18 to create the first realistic likeness			1
she spent 18 months trawling diaries , letters and other documents for information , before royal sculptor @entity24 used her findings to build the 5ft 6in waxwork			2
miss @entity18 , who trained in composite art with the @entity11 , used diaries , letters and written accounts for any snippet of information about her physical appearance			1
royal sculptor @entity24 then brought her research to life and created the 5ft 6ins waxwork which was unveiled yesterday			0
miss @entity18 said : ‘ in the drawing @entity16 made , it really does n't reflect the fun , witty , amusing person that all written accounts of her seem to portray - this really lovely girl			0
‘ from all the accounts i looked through , i tried to reflect someone who would sit there plotting her next book			0
’ she added : ‘ it was so interesting to find out whatever i could from reading different bits and whatever i could about her			0
’ @entity1 lived between 1775 and 1817 , moving to @entity4 in 1800 and on to @entity49 in 1809 before her death			2
@entity51 and researcher @entity18 created the first realistic likeness , left , as @entity1 never sat for an official picture			0
the portrait , right , was based on a sketch by the author 's sister @entity16 the artist said that @entity1 's family all seemed to share the same long nose , brown eyes and curly brown hair the only authenticated sketch of her was produced in 1810 by her sister @entity16 , drawn in pencil and watercolours and depicting her sitting in a chair			1
since then portraits have been produced but these are only interpretations of @entity16 's original image - including the images of @entity1 on the £ 10 note			0
miss @entity18 , who trained as a portrait painter at the @entity74 and has worked as @entity76 artist with the @entity11 in @entity77 , also took into account family traits			2
‘ she came from a large @entity1 family and they all seemed to share the long nose , the bright sparkly brown eyes and curly brown hair , ’ she said			1
‘ and these characteristics come through the generations			0
