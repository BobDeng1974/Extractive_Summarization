texting while driving can be incredibly dangerous and in most countries it is completely outlawed			2
that does n’t stop some thoughtless motorists from trying to compose a message while flying along a motorway , though , increasing the chance of a fatal accident			0
but now one company claims to have developed a ‘ texting gun ’ that can recognise the frequency of a text message , allowing police to fine people for doing it			1
the @entity20 ( shown ) , made by @entity21 , can apparently discern if a phone is being used to make a call , data transfer or text			1
this is useful for countries where the law on phone usage is complicated in the @entity31 it is illegal to use your phone at all when driving , while the law varies in the @entity34 from state to state - most allow phone calls but no texting			1
drivers caught using a phone in the @entity31 can be charged up to £ 1,000 ( $ 1,640 ) and also lose their license - although hands - free kits and sat navs are allowed			0
these inconsistencies can make it difficult for police to work out if a person is being distracted by their phone or not			0
this led to @entity17 - based @entity21 to design a gun that can detect frequencies			1
using an @entity51 while driving could put you in prison for up to two years , motoring experts have warned			0
when the gadget is released next year , it will allow users to make and receive calls , check their messages and monitor their health by operating the device on their wrists			0
but people who use @entity51 while on the road are at risk of causing fatal crashes and will face the same penalties as those caught on their mobile phones			0
this is according to the @entity71 - based @entity70 ( @entity70 ) who has warned that smartwatches will ' significantly ' impair driving performance			0
existing research by the @entity70 on smartphone use between 2006 and 2010 found distraction from a mobile phone was a contributory factor in 1,960 road accidents , 110 of which were fatal			0
the device , called the @entity83 , is currently in production although no release date or price has been announced yet			0
according to the @entity88 , it can discern the different frequencies from a text message , phone call and data transfer			1
it apparently uses similar technology used by cable repairmen to find where a cable is damaged , who look for transmission ‘ leaks ’			0
for states like @entity17 where talking on the phone while driving is legal but texting is not , this could be especially useful			2
in addition , the device can apparently even work out which person in the car is texting , so it will not alert police to issue a fine if it spots frequencies from a passenger			2
the device has yet to be given legislative approval amid some privacy concerns , but @entity116 of @entity21 told the @entity88 it was ‘ close to production			1
’ when reached for further comment on these privacy concerns and also how accurate the device is in discerning signals , @entity21 was yet to respond			1
in the @entity34 , for example , some states allow calls but not texts while driving			2
this means police could identify texters and find them on the spot			1
the company is currently seeking legislative approval for the ' texting gun ' amid some privacy concerns			1
