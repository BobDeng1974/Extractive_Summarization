by @entity0 a ban on books being sent to prisoners designed to stop smuggling of drugs and other contraband has today been criticised by the chief inspector of prisons			1
@entity8 says the government is trying to ' micromanage ' @entity11 's jails and the restriction on reading materials should be ' considered a mistake '			1
pressure on justice secretary @entity16 to perform a u-turn is increasing daily , with even senior @entity19 colleagues calling the ban ' unenlightened '			1
disapproval : chief inspector of prisons , @entity8 , left , says banning sending of books to jails is a mistake , ramping up further pressure on @entity16 , right , to perform a u-turn it was brought in as part of a new ‘ incentives and earned privileges ’ regime introduced by the @entity33			1
but it has led to a chorus of criticism , including from some of @entity11 ’s best known authors			1
an extraordinary letter damning the ban was signed by @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity11 ’s poet laureate @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			2
now the prisons boss @entity8 has added his voice to the campaign			2
' the problem in this case is trying to micromanage this , with the centre describing very detailed lists of what prisoners can and ca n't have , ' he told the @entity64			0
' i think that 's a mistake			0
' i think that once the policy intention is clear , how that 's implemented should be left much more to the discretion and the common sense of governors , so that they can reflect the needs of their particular prison population '			2
critics : @entity51 , left , and @entity77 , right , are two big names who have come out against the new prison scheme backing : other signatories include @entity42 ( left ) and @entity11 's poet laureate @entity43 ( right ) the scheme has caused uproar among writers and civil liberties groups - one of which likened it to measures seen at the @entity90			1
they argue there should be no restrictions on access to books in prisons , supposed to be places of rehabilitation and education			0
the new regime prevents prisoners being sent parcels , previously allowed at the discretion of jail governors , except in exceptional circumstances such as for provision of medical supplies			0
reform campaigners say that as well as books , other items , such as underwear and stationery , are being restricted			0
inmates have to buy items from prison shops instead			2
attack : civil liberties groups say that the @entity33 is trying to impose a policy used at @entity90 , but the government says it will stop the flow of drugs the justice secretary has insisted that parcels being sent into prisons had been a vehicle for ‘ contraband ’ and there were not enough staff to check them all properly			1
he insisted prisoners could access books from jail libraries and could purchase more using money earned by working inside			1
‘ parcels are an obvious conduit for getting drugs into prisons			0
if we allowed all prisoners to have access to parcels from home , it would be an impossible volume of post to go through systematically , ’ mr @entity16 said			0
‘ what we have done is set out rules that say when people can have parcels from home			0
the idea that we are banning access to books for prisoners is frankly ridiculous ' .			0

@entity8 says government *guilty* of trying to ' micromanage ' @entity11 jails
@entity157 is designed to stem flow of contraband into the hands of prisoner
@entity11 's best known authors have *flocked* to damn ' unenlightened ' policy
even senior @entity166 have criticised @entity16 's *hardline* approach
justice *minister* says inmates can use jail libraries or buy their own books
