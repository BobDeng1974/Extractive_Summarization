with a name like ‘ @entity2 ’ , you ’d imagine the singer @entity2 would drive something a little more challenging than a run - of - the - mill family car			1
but you might not expect to find her behind the wheel of an armoured fortress bristling with hi - tech anti-personnel gadgets			1
however , now that the former @entity11 is carving out a successful tv career in @entity13 , she has decided that what she really , really wants is a £ 200,000 specially modified attack - proof @entity15 capable of destroying the tyres of pursuing vehicles			1
her giant , gas - guzzling sports utility vehicle will even give an electric shock — up to 240 volts - worth of ‘ non-lethal current ’ — to car - jackers , paparazzi or anyone else foolish enough to grab the door handles in a bid to gain entry			1
at the push of a button , it will belch out dense white smoke to help the driver evade any pursuing vehicle , and pump out small spikes to puncture their tyres			0
some customers specify pressurised cabins and on - board oxygen supplies to protect against chemical and gas attacks			1
@entity2 ’s specially armoured and fully loaded seven - seater vehicle was delivered to her at her home in @entity55 , @entity56 , recently by @entity57 , vice-president of the @entity58 in @entity59			1
his 38 - year - old @entity61 - born client also has an armoured @entity62 and @entity63 on order , he said			1
@entity58 employs 50 people and customises about 200 vehicles a year , usually for heads of state , politicians , business executives , diplomats and royal families			1
but more recently , @entity13 celebrities and sport stars have sparked a mini-boom in armoured vehicles as the worsening international climate — from chemical strikes in @entity78 to terrorist attacks in @entity80 and @entity81 — have made them twitchy about their personal safety and the risk of kidnap or worse			1
these stars include @entity87 actor @entity86 and the rapper @entity88 , who recently ordered two outrageous @entity90 - built @entity89 costing £ 800,000 each			1
they are made by @entity91 , the same company which built @entity86 ’s gold - plated presidential suv which featured in his film @entity93			1
@entity58 ’s mr @entity57 , 32 , said : ‘ five years ago we had no @entity13 celebrities as customers			1
nowadays , we have anywhere between 10 to 15 orders a year from celebrities and professional athletes			2
’ @entity2 is the latest celebrity to purchase the high - security vehicle after @entity88 ( right ) reportedly ordered two similar £ 800,000 cars they include @entity102 and rapper @entity103 , who has a blinged - up version of @entity2 ’s @entity15 , including a 32in flat - screen television with satellite tv and mobile @entity108			1
love - cheat golfer @entity109 is also understood to have one of the firm ’s armoured cars , which is presumably more than capable of withstanding a sustained attack from an angry wife wielding a nine - iron			2
@entity2 — who is a judge on @entity117 and has been co-hosting @entity119 ’s today show — and her producer husband @entity120 have opted for a traditional family - friendly interior to suit the lifestyles of her daughters @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and stepdaughter @entity128			2
mr @entity57 said : ‘ i delivered it to their house in @entity55			0
they are very good people			2
we all went for a test drive so they knew how to use all the different options			0
her husband is a big car guy			2
she drove it for a while — and on the right side			0
‘ it ’s pretty much the standard leather interior			0
they ’ve got kids so are pretty down to earth about things			0
’ from the outside , these cars are virtually indistinguishable from the standard models — but have been stripped down to the frame and rebuilt with armour and hi - tech gadgets			2
in a country where guns are part of the fabric of day - to - day life — ‘ i carry a gun in my pocket every day : we ’re in @entity159 , ’ says mr @entity57 — customers can specify a special gun - port through which to shoot at attackers on the outside			1
and @entity58 clearly has supreme confidence in its product			0
in an astonishing video on the firm ’s website — which comes with a ‘ do n’t try this at home ’ health warning — president and chief executive @entity172 is seen crouching behind a sheet of the company ’s bullet - proof glass while a young employee shoots at him with an @entity177			2
he lives to tell the tale as the triple - glazing shows up the spider - web impact of the bullets which nevertheless fail to penetrate the glass			1
but the @entity25 firm draws the line at emulating one @entity189 security company which fitted a flame - thrower to a top - of - the - range @entity191			2
at the push of a dashboard button , it shoots up a wall of fire outside the driver ’s car door in order to incinerate any would - be car - jacker			1
demand for armoured cars is also on the increase on this side of the @entity205			0
in @entity87 they are popular with @entity208 oligarchs			0
luxury car - makers such as @entity210 , @entity191 , @entity211 and @entity63 already have their own ‘ in - house ’ security arms which build in armouring from scratch			1
mr @entity57 acknowledges their high level of expertise , but says his company — which takes apart existing cars and customises them with armour and gadgets before re-assembling them — can do almost as high a specification but at a fraction of the cost			0
among the car makes they tackle are @entity228 , @entity211 , @entity210 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity191 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and even the more humble @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238			2
the most expensive car mr @entity57 has sold to date is a customised and armoured £ 500,000 ( $ 800,000 ) stretch @entity63 @entity241 for an unnamed client			1
when he was prime minister , @entity244 took delivery of a fully armoured @entity246 — dubbed the ‘ @entity250 ’ after the @entity248 word for armour			0
ironically , on delivery in @entity253 , police found that illegal immigrants had stowed away in the container lorry transporting it to @entity87			0
@entity260 has , as his official car , an armoured , top - of - the - range @entity256			1
but trumping them all is @entity25 president @entity262 with his gargantuan armoured @entity264 - style limousine , dubbed ‘ @entity265 ’ , which follows him around the globe on official visits			0
security expert @entity268 , in @entity269 , says that for the super-rich earning millions , the cost of an armoured vehicle is a drop in the ocean and a sensible investment			0
‘ what ’s your life worth ? ’ he says			0
‘ a bullet costs about 25 cents			0
it will go through a non-armoured vehicle pretty efficiently			0
so to spend three - quarters of a million dollars on an armoured vehicle is n’t that outrageous			0
’ no doubt , @entity2 would agree			0
the former @entity11 ’s current vehicle certainly brings a whole new meaning to the term ‘ girl power ’ .			0

the £ 200,000 @entity15 is a *favourite* among celebrities
the car can withstand bullets , bombs , chemical attacks and shocks anyone who tries to grab its door handles
customers can even choose a gun - port to shoot at people on the outside
