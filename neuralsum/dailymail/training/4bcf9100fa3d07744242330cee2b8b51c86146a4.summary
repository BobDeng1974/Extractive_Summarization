by @entity0 when fashion design student @entity1 was watching a @entity3 video she was stunned to see a face that looked uncannily like her own staring out of her computer screen			1
miss @entity1 then discovered that not only did she share a birthday with @entity8 , the actress in the clip , but the pair had both been born in @entity11 , @entity12 - prompting the young women 's claim that they are twins who were separated at birth and adopted by different families on opposite sides of the globe			1
now the pair ’s astonishing story is to be made to a documentary film and a book , focussing on their chance meeting via the internet , and the moment they came face to face for the first time			1
she also shared similar mannerisms to the actress , who turned out to be @entity53 , also 26 , who grew up in @entity54 , @entity38 and was living in @entity55			2
miss @entity1 contacted aspiring actress @entity53 on @entity56 and the women say they soon worked out that they were both born in the @entity12 capital on november 19 , 1987			1
' i was terrified and excited at the same time , ' miss @entity1 told @entity60			1
' @entity61 responded with a picture of her birth records			0
there was nothing there to say she was a twin but then she sent pictures through and it seemed to settle it			0
it felt like having a heart attack , but it was also the happiest moment - a new world was opening			0
' contact : miss @entity1 ( left ) contacted aspiring actress @entity53 ( right ) on @entity56 and the women say they soon worked out that they were both born in the @entity12 capital on november 19 , 1987 miss @entity1 had been placed into foster care by an @entity39 agency - @entity75 - and adopted by her @entity43 parents three months later			1
meanwhile miss @entity8 was adopted around three months after her birth , having been fostered by another agency - @entity78			2
she said that documentation given to her adoptive parents did not contain the names of her birth parents , or if she had any brothers or sisters			0
following their @entity56 conversation the women plucked up the courage to speak to one another via a @entity34 video call			0
miss @entity8 then started a @entity90 page to fund a documentary to chronicle their first meeting and their subsequent adventures together			1
truth : miss @entity8 ( left ) and @entity40 ( right ) say that have taken a dna test , but have vowed only to reveal the result in their film the pair hoped to raise $ 30,000 , around £ 19,000 , and more than 1,000 people have donated a total of $ 44,000 ( £ 27,000 ) - which paid for a dna test to reveal once and for all if the pair are in fact sisters			1
the women have now started a second @entity90 campaign to raise $ 80,000 ( £ 49,000 ) for their documentary 's post-production , and have taken in more than $ 20,000 ( £ 12,000 )			2
they say that have taken a dna test , but have vowed only to reveal the result in their film - prompting some to wonder if the pair 's story is an elaborate hoax			1
miss @entity8 journeyed to @entity45 to meet @entity40 in may last year			2
miss @entity1 said : ' the door opened and i felt paralysed			2
she was right in front of me and i did n't want to move			0
we were just staring at each other			0
' similarity : the suspected twins say they have used their physical similarities to play tricks on their parents - just like in the 1998 @entity128 film @entity129 she said that her father had cried upon meeting miss @entity8 , while her mother believed that the pair were so alike that they had to be sisters			1
they both share a love of @entity138 , the arts , and many of the same television programmes , while @entity40 confessed that the duo had taken advantage of their physical similarities to play a trick on miss @entity8 's mother and father			0
' i came out first and surprised them and they stopped for five seconds , saying , " what ? what ? no ! " and they said we were identical too			0
it was just like @entity129			0
' the 1961 @entity156 movie , remade in 1998 starring @entity157 , features twins who were separated as babies and brought up by their divorced mother and father respectively only to meet as teenagers at summer camp .			0
