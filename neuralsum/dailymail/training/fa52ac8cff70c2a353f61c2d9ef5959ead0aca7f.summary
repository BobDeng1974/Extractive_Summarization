by @entity0 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity1 beat @entity2 6 - 3 7 - 5 in the @entity4 quarter - final to set up a final - four clash with @entity7 @entity6			1
a turnaround in the second and decisive set saw @entity10 no 1 @entity2 hit the self - destruct button , relinquishing a 4 - 1 lead over his @entity14 counterpart to lose 7 - 5			1
@entity2 could have little complaints , though , as @entity1 looked in superior form to the man six places adrift of him in the world rankings			2
@entity20 : @entity1 beat @entity2 in straight sets to reach the @entity4 quarter - final tough going : @entity2 could n't find an answer to @entity1 's tricks in the quarter - final and lost 6 - 3 7 - 5 in the end @entity1 could n't capitalise on six break points early on			1
the @entity26 3 did , however , pounce on the seventh , taking the fourth game to move into a 3 - 1 lead in the opening set			1
it continued that same way as @entity1 took the first set 6 - 3			1
his first serve proved deadly , winning 83 per cent compared to @entity2 's mediocre 56			0
@entity2 had to improve and at first , he looked like he had			0
the 27 - year - old cut a different figure in the second set , breaking his @entity14 counterpart twice to establish a very health 4 - 1 lead			1
that , though , did n't last long			0
@entity1 won four consecutive games to make it 5 - 4 and a frustrated @entity2 could only turn and mutter to himself in the aftermath			1
the @entity26 9 looked defeated - mentally and physically - after letting his advantage slip			2
winner : @entity1 proved too good for @entity2 in the end in the @entity4 quarter - final popular : the @entity14 star celebrates victory and a place in the last four of the event in @entity50 @entity1 sat just two points away from winning the quarter - final clash , and an outrageously - good backhand from the seven - time @entity55 champion sent @entity2 sprawling to move him one away			1
@entity2 could find no answers to @entity1 , who sealed the win with another break in the final set			2
@entity2 was left to ponder what might have been had he taken his numerous opportunities to break @entity1 's serve			2
he told atpworldtour.com : ' i started the match off pretty slow tonight			0
' [ @entity1 ] came out quick			0
then i had a couple break points in back - to - back games to get into it in the first set			0
i did n't get either of them			0
' then obviously was well up in the second and blew it			0
' preparation : @entity2 will head to @entity74 for the @entity75 at @entity76			0
