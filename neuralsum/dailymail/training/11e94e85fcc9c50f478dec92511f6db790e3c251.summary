but a new study suggests that people who believe they have a guardian angel take fewer risks and live less adventurous lives you might think that people who believe they have an all - powerful protective spirit watching over them would take lots of risks			1
but a new study suggests that those who think they have a guardian angel take fewer risks and live less adventurous lives			1
the finding is the opposite of what researchers expected			0
@entity16 , professor of disaster and @entity18 at @entity19 , @entity20 , examined the link between belief and risk - taking behaviour			1
‘ we hypothesised that a belief in guardian spirits would tend to be associated with a decreased risk perception and therefore an increase in risk - taking behaviour			1
‘ however , we found that instead of this belief making people able to take more risks because they feel protected , the results clearly indicated that those who believe in guardian angels are more likely to be risk - averse			1
professor @entity16 and his team interviewed 198 people for the study			2
they noted how interviewees viewed risk , what sort of risky behaviour they participated in and why they chose to do so			2
they found that 68 per cent of participants who indicated a belief in guardian spirits said it affects how they take risks , with a clear majority indicating that they are more risk - averse than non-believers , according to the paper published in the journal @entity53 open			1
for example , volunteers were asked to rate breaking the speed limit by 13 mph ( 20kph ) on a scale of one to five in terms of risk and believers rated it riskier than non-believers			0
‘ it appears that the dominant cause - and - effect relationship is opposite to the one we originally hypothesised , ’ professor @entity16 said			0
‘ we think that those who are more risk - averse use belief in guardian spirits as a coping mechanism to deal with their fear and anxiety over perceived risks in their environment			1
’ nearly a third of @entity76 - 29 per cent - believe that a guardian angel is always watching over them , according to research published in 2010			2
a slightly higher number - 31 per cent - admitted they believe in angels , while one in 20 said they have actually seen or heard one			0
just 17 per cent said they are not sure what to believe			0
@entity85 had the highest levels of believers at 40 per cent , according to the survey by the @entity89 and @entity90			0
the @entity91 scored the lowest , at 17 per cent			0
people in the capital also scored the highest for believing a guardian angel watches over them , at 37 per cent , compared with 22 per cent in @entity95 and the @entity91			2
the survey showed that 45 per cent of people interviewed from @entity98 and 43 per cent of those from @entity99 believed they have a guardian angel			2
this figure fell to 16 per cent for those in @entity103 and @entity104			0
but researchers warned that the city results were based on small numbers – with just 17 people interviewed from @entity98 , 19 from @entity99 , 39 from @entity103 and 27 from @entity104			0
the researchers found that 68 per cent of participants who indicated a belief in guardian spirits said it affects how they take risks ( stock image ) , with a majority indicating they are more risk - averse than non-believers			1

study by @entity19 , @entity20 , looked at belief and risk - taking behaviour
experts *predicted* that people who believe in guardian spirits would take more risks , but they found that believers are less likely to take risks
this may be because they use an angel as a coping mechanism to deal with their fear and anxiety over perceived risks in their environment , experts say
