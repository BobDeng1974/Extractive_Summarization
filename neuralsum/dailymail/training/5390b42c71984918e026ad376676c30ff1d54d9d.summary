by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 11:39 est , 24 july 2013 snow on ancient @entity4 is the most likely reason for the network of valleys that exist there , @entity2 scientists have said			1
researchers at @entity10 have shown that some @entity4 valleys appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation -- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes			1
the findings help to answer the question of whether water flowing on ancient @entity4 bubbled up from the ground or fell down from the atmosphere			1
researchers at @entity10 have shown that some martian valleys ( pictured ) appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation -- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes scientists studied four different locations on @entity4 that they suspected had water - carved valleys , caused by snow or rainfall when moist prevailing winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges			1
the new findings , published in @entity37 , are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient @entity4 and could shed new light on the planet 's early climate and atmosphere			1
@entity44 , a geological sciences graduate student at @entity10 , led the research and is well - acquainted with the orographic effect			2
she did graduate work in meteorology in @entity48 , which is home to a quintessential orographic pattern			2
moist tropical winds from the east are pushed upward when they hit the mountains of @entity48 's big island			1
the winds lack the kinetic energy to reach the mountain summit , so they dump their moisture on the eastern side of the island , making parts of it a tropical jungle			0
the findings help to answer the question of whether water flowing on ancient @entity4 bubbled up from the ground or fell down from the atmosphere			1
@entity69 's @entity68 ( pictured ) found evidence of ' drinkable ' water in clay minerals in @entity73 , in march the western side , in contrast , is nearly a desert because it sits in a rain shadow cast by the mountain peak			0
ms @entity44 thought similar orographic patterns might have been at play on early @entity4 and that the valley networks might be an indicator			1
' that 's what immediately came to mind in trying to figure out if these valleys on @entity4 are precipitation related , ' she said			0
the scientists started by identifying four @entity4 locations where valley networks were found along tall mountain ridges or raised crater rims			1
to establish the direction of the prevailing winds at each location , the researchers used a newly developed general circulation model ( @entity98 ) for @entity4			2
the model simulated air movement based on the gas composition scientists think was present in the early @entity4 atmosphere			2
the team then used a model of orographic precipitation to determine where , given the prevailing winds from the @entity98 , precipitation would be likely to fall in each of the study areas			0
the new findings , published in @entity37 , are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient @entity4 and could shed new light on the planet 's early climate and atmosphere			1
a photo of the red planet , taken by the curiosity rover is pictured the simulations showed that precipitation would have been heaviest at the heads of the densest valley networks			0
ms @entity44 said : ' their drainage density varies in the way you would expect from the complex response of precipitation to topography			0
we were able to confirm that in a pretty solid way			0
' the atmospheric parameters used in the @entity98 are based on other models that predict a cold climate on the red planet , so the precipitation modeled in this study was snow			0
however , the researchers said that the snow could have been melted by episodic warming conditions to form the valley networks and therefore it could also have rained on ancient @entity4			2
ms @entity44 said : ' the next step is to do some snowmelt modeling			0
' the question is how fast can you melt a giant snowbank			0
do you need rain ? is it even possible to get enough discharge [ to carve the valleys ] with just the snowmelt ? ' the answers to these questions could provide an insight into the climate on @entity4 billions of years ago .			0

@entity2 scientists have shown some @entity4 valleys appear to have been caused by snow when winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges
the findings by @entity10 help to determine whether water flowing on ancient @entity4 bubbled up from the ground or fell from the atmosphere
one of the researchers was *inspired* by the orographic patterns in @entity48 and thought they might have been at play on early @entity4
