mr @entity76 said : ‘ we had about 120 people in a show of support next to the war memorial in @entity101			0
the @entity103 soldiers who shot dead unarmed @entity104 have n’t been arrested for murder – so why are we arresting @entity6 who were being attacked and shot at ? ’ mr @entity76 added that the mother of the accused @entity108 he had met had told him £ 1,000 a month was being taken out of his wages to pay his legal fees			1
