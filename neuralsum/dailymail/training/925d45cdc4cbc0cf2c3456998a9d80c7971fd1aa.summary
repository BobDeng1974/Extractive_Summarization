every youngster loves to play in the mud , and it ’s no different for these rascally lion cubs			0
but they ’re going to give their mum an extra headache , because three of the four new siblings are ultra-rare white lions ... and getting the dirt out of their creamy fur is going to require a lot of licking			1
these extraordinary pictures are the first - ever photographs of new - born white lions in the wild			1
they are found in just one place on @entity19 , the @entity20 in @entity21 , where just 13 remain — and that total includes these cubs			1
it ’s serious work , being so young , so rare and so cute			0
but these boisterous characters have got their paws full exploring and practising their play - fighting			0
so while the older members of the pride keep a watch for danger , the cubs have fun			0
these extraordinary photographs are the first - ever pictures of new - born white lions in the wild the three cubs lie dozing in the dirt while their mother keeps watch for any sign of danger the three snow - white cubs owe their unusual colour to a rare genetic marker that results in a white pelt but pigmented eyes , skin and paws the new arrivals are part of a pride with six adults , including two fully grown white lionesses			1
@entity62 photographer @entity61 , 39 , who took these pictures , was able to identify the cubs ’ mother : ‘ she has piercing blue eyes , ’ he said , ‘ and together with her white coat , she was supremely photogenic			2
’ but it is not known which male is the father because the cubs are not albinos but owe their remarkable colouring to a genetic twist , which many @entity77 lions carry			1
the leucism pigment gene gives them blue or green - grey eyes instead of brown , and a pelt that remains white all their lives			0
just like a human family trait , the recessive gene can lie dormant for generations and then reappear — so any of the tawny males could have fathered these cubs			0
it is even possible for two brown adults to have a litter of white cubs — but only if they are @entity77 lions			1
the indigenous @entity95 tribe has known about the white lions for centuries , and their medicine men traditionally believe them to be animal angels			2
one legend says they were the first creatures to be created by the gods — and when life becomes extinct the roar of the white lions will be the last sound on @entity19			1
one of the white lion cubs play fights with a tawny cub			0
the three white cubs are part of a pride of six adults , including two fully grown white lionesses these are the first ever pictures of white lion cubs born to a white lioness in the wild			1
pictured is a white cub play fighting with a relative the birth of the extremely rare cubs has been celebrated by conservation groups that include the @entity125 @entity127 , the mother of the white lion cubs is pictured yawning , and right , she bares her teeth in an ominous sign a group of cubs , two of which are white and the other a traditional tawny colour , wander out of the bush together @entity139 first discovered them in 1938 , though they were not well known until the @entity140 , when naturalist @entity141 published two books			0
although the white mutation probably evolved many millennia ago , some conservationists feared white lions could not survive in the wild : their colouring would make it impossible to remain camouflaged while hunting			1
consequently , almost all of the white lions were rounded up and sold to zoos , if they were not killed by big game hunters first			2
yet these pictures prove white lions can thrive in the wild			1
tragically , these beautiful creatures do face a deadly threat because of the colour of their pelts — and it comes from man			0
hunters pay grotesque sums to slaughter lions , even though it is illegal to hunt them almost everywhere in @entity21			2
white lions are especially prized			2
in @entity21 , a particularly vile practice has emerged , known as canned hunting : lions are captured in the wild as cubs , or bred in captivity , and brought up as tourist attractions			1
a white lioness and her cub nuzzle each other in a heartwarming display of affection the majority of the pride rest in this picture taken in the early morning , while one of the white cubs gets up early seeking attention the three cubs wander around the sleeping pride in the early morning			2
only thirteen white lions exist in the @entity190 in @entity21 they are bottle - fed , taught not to fear humans , and spend their days being petted and photographed by unwitting visitors			1
but when the cubs grow too big to enchant the tourists , they are put into a small enclosure — to be shot by some foreign ‘ hunter ’ who wants to hang a lion ’s head on his wall and brag that he killed it			0
one @entity204 recently handed over $ 165,000 , or £ 105,000 , to kill a ‘ canned ’ lion			0
for all these grim warnings , the discovery of the cubs is still reason for rejoicing			0
‘ the birth of these second generation white cubs to a wild white lioness is fantastic news , ’ says conservationist @entity210 , who has reintroduced seven captive white lions into @entity77 , and who founded the @entity125 to campaign for their survival			1
it brings huge hope for the future of white lions			2
’ the former model , who fell in love with the animals during a safari in 1991 , takes a mystical view of the white lions : ‘ they are @entity21 ’s pride and joy , our living national treasure			1
the @entity95 believe they are sacred animals , and frankly i support the @entity95 on that			0
’ sacred or not , that fur is going to need a lot of work before mum is satisfied it ’s clean again .			0
