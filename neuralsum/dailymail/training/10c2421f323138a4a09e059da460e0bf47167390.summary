by @entity0 an artist has been arrested in @entity2 for scanning a 3d version of a selfie she took of her vagina and distributing it to supporters , to allow them to build kayaks in the form of her anatomy			1
@entity11 made her own kayak using a 3d scanner , which you can see in the photo below			1
however her feminist agenda has been curtailed by her arrest , which occurred when she emailed the 3d scan of her private parts to 30 people			1
on her blog @entity11 , 42 , made a plea for money to enable her to move on from art made from hand moulds of her vagina			1
she wrote on her blog : ‘ mould by hand is not suitable for making large art pieces such as a door , a car , or a boat			0
i was wondering how i can make it possible , and then i finally found that @entity13 can make it happen easily ! ' ‘ a 3d scanner can be used to make a boat that will go across the ocean ! ' but the problem is the technology and the cost			0
i can not afford it nor use the scanner alone			0
‘ so here is my request for your support to make the world ’s first @entity13 scanned vagina boat that goes beyond the seas			2
’ while , by evidence of these photographs , it seems @entity11 did receive adequate funding for her bizzare and ambitious project , it led to her falling foul of the @entity2 obscenity laws			1
other items she has fashioned using her vagina as part of her @entity70 project include jewellery ( bottom right ) , as well as numerous small ' scenes ¿ in which tiny model men are posed on grass covered moulds of her vagina @entity78 reports that she is currently being held by police in @entity80			2
other items she has fashioned using her vagina include a lampshade , a remote - controlled car , and a smartphone case , as well as numerous small ‘ scenes ’ in which tiny model men are posed on grass covered moulds of her vagina			0
on her blog , where she writes about her work and exhibitions under the pseudonym @entity90 which roughly translates to ‘ bad girl ’ or ' good - for - nothing girl ' , @entity11 says : ‘ i thought it was just funny to decorate my vagina and make into a diorama , but i was very surprised to see how upset people get when they see my works or even hear me say the word @entity30			1
' @entity30 and vagina , have been such a taboo in @entity2 society			2
penis , on the other hand , has been used in illustrations and has become a part of pop culture			0
' but vagina has never been so cute			0
@entity108 has been thought to be obscene because its been overly hidden ; although it is just a part of a woman ’s body			0

@entity11 is a @entity2 artist who makes art using her vagina
aims to *demystify* the female anatomy in @entity2
latest project has seen her arrested under @entity2 obscenity laws
took a ' selfie ' of her vagina and scanned it to a 3d printer
the *template* could be made into a kayak based on her anatomy
@entity11 emailed it to 30 people , which led her to fall foul of obscenity laws
these people helped her *pay* for the project through crowd - funding
