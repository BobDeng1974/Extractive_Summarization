' whether intentional or not , this gray and white stripped pattern and pink triangle combination is deeply offensive and should not be mainstreamed into popular culture , ' said @entity21 , @entity9 's national director and a @entity8 survivor			1
offensive ? @entity0 ' tapestry , pictured ( left ) in a @entity17 store , is said to closely resemble a @entity6 concentration camp uniform forced upon male gay prisoners during the @entity8 ( right ) mr @entity21 stated : ' we urge @entity0 to immediately remove the product eerily reminiscent of clothing forced upon the victims of the @entity8 from their stores and online			1
' between 1933 and 1945 the @entity32 arrested up to 100,000 gay men and the death rate for homosexual prisoners in the camps was said to be 50per cent			0
the tapestry in question does not currently appear on @entity0 ' website , but a store clerk from its @entity16 store told @entity43 she ' recalled seeing it sold in the last few months ' but added it was no longer available			2
@entity0 ' other tapestry designs retail for between $ 39 and $ 69 , and are described as being ' the perfect piece for topping off your bed , wall , or favorite chair ' , or used as a ' beach or picnic blanket '			1
a representative from the clothing giant is yet to respond to @entity56 's request for comment			1
not the first time : in 2012 , @entity9 took offence to a $ 100 yellow t - shirt sold by @entity0 ( left ) which it deemed too similar to the yellow star of @entity62 worn by @entity64 people in @entity6 ( right ) well - trodden path : in 2003 , @entity9 targeted @entity0 once again over a t - shirt with a message reading , ' everyone loves a @entity64 girl ' , surrounded by dollar signs ( pictured ) it 's not the first time @entity9 has criticized designs sold by @entity0			2

the t - shirt was subsequently recalled and its designer @entity94 responded by saying the design was ' in no way a reference to @entity98 , @entity99 , or the @entity8			0
' more controversy : in 2011 , the retailer sold a t - shirt emblazoned with the phrase ' @entity104 ' ( right ) and last year , a t - shirt which read ' depression ' ( left ) - both drew criticism for glamorizing mental illness insensitive : last year , it recalled what appeared to be a blood - spattered ' @entity113 ' sweatshirt ( pictured ) , which many interpreted as a reference to the 1970s @entity113 massacre and in 2003 , @entity9 targeted @entity0 once again over a t - shirt with a message reading , ' everyone loves a @entity64 girl ' , surrounded by dollar signs			2

the retailer 's tapestries are *touted* as ' the perfect piece for topping off your bed , wall , or favorite chair '
the design in question is gray and white striped with a pink triangle
@entity64 antisemitism organisation @entity9 says the tapestry is ' eerily reminiscent ' of @entity6 concentration camp uniforms
male gay captives were forced to wear pink triangles on their striped prison attire during the @entity8
the tapestry does not appear on @entity164 's website , but has been photographed in a @entity17 store
@entity0 is yet to *publicly* respond to @entity9 's request that the tapestry be recalled , or @entity56 's request for comment
