by @entity0 published : 16:28 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 16:28 est , 27 march 2012 shock waves from comets bombarding the @entity4 may have helped to build proteins and set the stage for life , scientists have learned			1
comets , giant snowballs of ice and dust , are known to have carried organic chemicals and water to the early @entity4			1
but just what caused life to spring out of nowhere on a barren and desolate planet billions of years ago remains a mystery			1
rock on : it 's thought that comets were responsible for kick - starting life on @entity4 now scientists may have part of the answer			1
laboratory experiments have shown that amino acids - organic molecules that are the building blocks of proteins - would have survived violent comet impacts			2
what is more , the shock of a large comet impact would have provided the energy needed to start bonding amino acids together to make proteins			2
proteins provide the raw material that allows all living things , from microbes to humans , to exist and function			2
their creation by comets may explain how life appeared so quickly at the end of a period 3.8 billion years ago called the ‘ late heavy bombardment ’			1
during this turbulent time the @entity4 was showered by both comets and rocky asteroids , leaving crater scars that are still seen on the @entity48			1
dr @entity49 , who led the @entity51 scientists from the @entity53 / @entity52 in @entity54 , @entity55 , said : ‘ our research shows that the building blocks of life could , indeed , have remained intact despite the tremendous shock wave and other violent conditions in a comet impact			0
‘ @entity8 really would have been the ideal packages for delivering ingredients for the chemical evolution thought to have resulted in life			0
we like the comet delivery scenario because it includes all of the ingredients for life - amino acids , water and energy			0
’ dr @entity49 described the experiments at the annual meeting of the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity55			0
the first traces of life began about 3.5billion years ago , but it was 375million years ago that fish crawled out of the water her team set out to simulate conditions that existed when @entity4 was repeatedly struck by amino acid - carrying comets , some of which were 10 miles or more in diameter			1
one study used powerful gas guns to fire supersonic blasts of gas at capsules filled with amino acids , water and other materials			0
despite the heat and shock of the simulated collisions the amino acids did not break down			0
instead , they began forming the chain - like ‘ peptide bonds ’ that link amino acids together to make proteins			0
intense pressure from the impact offset the intense heat and supplied the energy needed to create the peptides			0
other experiments used computer models to simulate conditions as comets ploughed into the @entity4 's atmosphere			2
both comets and asteroids may have brought multiple deliveries of the ‘ seedlings of life ’ to @entity4 , said dr @entity49 .			1

@entity4 was *pounded* by asteroids *3.8billion* years ago
