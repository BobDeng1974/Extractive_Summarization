@entity0 dropped from 31st to 13st after making a ' conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations ' like parents evening weight crept on after he lost his mother to bowel cancer decided to slim down for the sake of his children averaged half a stone weight loss per week by @entity12 published : 07:36 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 4 january 2013 a man who was once too ashamed to be seen in public has found a new lease of life after losing an incredible 18st			1
@entity0 , 37 , from @entity18 , embarked upon a strict diet nine months ago after deciding he had had enough of missing out on life because of his size			1
as a last resort before considering gastric band surgery , 31st @entity0 decided instead to overhaul his diet and lifestyle			1
less than a year later , he has lost more than half his bodyweight - and says he has never felt better			1
the drastic weight loss has literally saved family man @entity0 ’s life			1
now @entity0 enjoys a very active lifestyle and is a great role model for his three sons			1
' people often think there should have been one life changing moment that made me decide once and for all to lose weight but there really was n’t ' , explains 37 - year old @entity0 from @entity18			1
big loser : @entity0 has lost nearly 18 stone in just nine months after embarking on a rigorous weight loss programme when he feared he would n't live to see his children grow up rather he feels that it was a combination of a number of factors that prompted him to do something about his weight			1
' i ’d had no major health scare to speak of , although at the size i was i generally tended to avoid the embarrassment of visiting the doctors			2
but i truly believe i was in denial for many years , because with a @entity56 over double what it should be at 59 it was n’t a case of if i fell ill , it was when			0
' ' i was a ticking timebomb health wise , but still that was n’t enough to make me lose weight			2
what really made me decide to do it were my boys and the thought of them growing up without a @entity67			0
' i vividly remember reading somewhere that the life expectancy for someone with a @entity56 of 40 was 20 years less than someone with a healthy @entity56 around 25			0
that made me realise that i was living on borrowed time			0
' @entity0 lost his mother in his mid 20s to bowel cancer and he says he did n’t want that for his boys			1
he wanted to be around to see them grow up , get married and have children of their own so decided to take action			1
motivated : @entity0 decided to embark on a strict diet after he became too embarrassed to attend his children 's parents evening for fear of them getting bullied because of his size @entity0 turned to the @entity88 programme , attending counsellor @entity90 ’ classes in @entity18			1
when he started at the beginning of february 2012 , he weighed 30st 13lbs			0
the programme saw him replace ordinary eating with four specially formulated food packs per day , alongside weekly counselling sessions to assess the psychological issues behind overeating and ensure a permanent lifestyle change			0
@entity0 is now gradually reintroducing food in a controlled manner combined with counselling and has shrunk to 13st 4lbs , taking his weight loss to 17st 9lbs			1
his @entity56 currently resides at 25.4			0
' the change has been unbelievable			0
it 's not just physical : inside i am a completely different person ' @entity0 said			1
' my life had come to the point where i was making a conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations , from having to ask for a seat belt extender on planes to never attending parents ’ evening at my sons ’ school so they would n’t get bullied about my size			1
happy : @entity0 has been enjoying spending time with his children and being able to be involved in all the holiday activities like going on a rollercoaster ' do n’t get me wrong - i was no shrinking violet and was a very sociable guy , i just avoided certain everyday situations			1
' if i am honest , it was more than just the everyday situations ; i was even avoiding extremely serious appointments			2
' for example , my mum died of bowel cancer at the age of 45 , so when i reached 35 i was supposed to go for a routine screening to make sure it could be caught early if i was unlucky enough to have it as well			1
' i ’d received the letter from the hospital but i was so worried that the hospital would n’t be able to do it because of the size of me that i did n’t go			0
' even though i knew one of major reasons that mum died was because it was n’t detected earlier , the embarrassment and fear kept me away			2
' i never want to feel like that again			0
' @entity0 puts his weight gain down to a combination of factors , one being that from the age of 16 he did a job where he sat behind a desk most of the day			1
by the time he married wife @entity151 at the age of 23 he was already tipping the scales at 20 stone and by the time his mother died four years later , he was nearly 26 stone			2
and for @entity0 , it was n't just food , it was alcohol to blame too			2
' while i ’ve never had a problem with drink , i could easily get through 10 or 12 pints of beer on a night out			0
' i now realise that it was more to do with how comfortable i felt in social situations rather than a need to drink			2
i would drink to rid myself of those social inhibitions that told me people were looking at me due to my size			0
' but since embarking on his rigorous diet , @entity0 has n't looked back			2
he said : ' over the last 10 months i have literally been the miraculous shrinking man			0
my weight loss has far exceeded all my expectations ; in 40 weeks i have averaged half a stone weight loss per week , which is incredible			1
' @entity0 is now able to enjoy time with his sons , @entity176 aged 14 , @entity177 who is 11 and four year old @entity178 , on trips and family holidays			2
' for once in my life i could run around with the boys all day , going on rollercoasters without the fear of being too big for the seat			0
' when we got back @entity177 said to me that it was the best family holiday he ’d ever had			0
i know it was n’t the nicest place we ’ve ever stayed , but i agree with him			0
' i put it down to the fact that i could join in with everything they did			0
i have a real zest for life now and the look of excitement on my sons ’ faces will stay with me forever			0
' ' the world is my oyster now and after losing all this weight i feel euphoric and like i can do anything that i put my mind to			0
