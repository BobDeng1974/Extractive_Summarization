by @entity0 a @entity2 family of 17 is collecting more than £ 55,000 a year in state benefits – nearly three times as much as the father earns			1
@entity6 and his wife would require a pre-tax income of around £ 125,000 a year to maintain the same standard of living for their brood			0
his wages of £ 1,800 a month as an electrician and the fact that they have 15 children mean they qualify for a raft of benefits which they say total £ 55,200			1
pictured from the left , back row , are : @entity29 , 17 , @entity30 , 16 , @entity31 , 19			0
middle row : @entity33 , 11 , @entity34 , four , @entity35 , 15 , @entity36 , two , @entity37 , eight , and @entity38 , 13			0
front row : @entity40 , 10 , holding @entity0 , one , @entity41 , six , @entity42 , five			0
@entity43 , 19 , is not in the picture they receive £ 2,500 a month in working tax credit , £ 1,400 in housing benefit for the three - bedroom rented home they cram their family into , and £ 700 in child benefit , which totals £ 4,600 a month			1
when mr @entity6 ’s £ 21,600 wage is added to the benefits , the family have a monthly income of £ 6,400 – or £ 76,800 a year			1
the government ’s £ 26,000 a year benefits cap does not apply as mr @entity6 is in work and entitled to the tax credits			2
the farcical situation was revealed after the family admitted they were so desperate for a new life that they lied to their private landlord about the size of their family to secure their home in @entity71 , @entity26			1
packed : housing inspectors were informed of the @entity74 ' living situation , and after visiting the property described it as one of the worst cases of overcrowding they had ever seen , but added the family had intentionally over-filled their home daughter @entity31 , 19 , speaking on behalf of mr @entity6 , 47 , and his wife @entity83 , 37 , told the @entity84 : ‘ if we have the benefits it ’s because it is our right in this country			1
we like it here , it ’s a nice place			0
’ she insisted they pay their £ 1,700 - a - month rent and council tax and ‘ spend the [ benefits ] money in this country for the food and everything the children need and keep the bills paid up to date ’ , adding that this includes repayments on a @entity102 people carrier parked outside			1
but the huge cost of supporting the family has led to renewed calls for a benefits overhaul			2
@entity107 , @entity108 mp for @entity109 , said : ‘ if people choose to come here with their families and work that ’s fine , but from their income they then have to generate the income to support their families , not expect the taxpayers of this country to subsidise their family			0
‘ the vast majority of people would say the public purse is supporting the family to a huge extent , far more than he is paid and far more than he pays in taxation			0
how is that reasonable ? ’ mr @entity107 raised the issue of the family ’s overcrowded house with the council after being alerted by neighbours while campaigning during the local elections			2
he said there was a concern about the children ’s welfare because of the cramped conditions			0
37462 19343 60800 59307 223469 95488 45080 37129 62996 campaigners say the @entity137 ’s generous system of in - work benefits , such as tax credits , are a massive lure for those from overseas			1
a migrant earning the minimum wage with a partner and two children can boost their net income threefold with tax credits and housing benefit			0
mr @entity6 was at work yesterday and several of the younger children were at school			0
but mrs @entity22 agreed to let her daughter @entity31 , who speaks good @entity153 , speak to the @entity84 on behalf of the family			0
eight of the 17 children are in local state schools , and @entity31 is studying business at college			2
she said the family originally lived in @entity161 , southern @entity2 , but moved to @entity162 seven years ago after mr @entity6 got a job there			1
after the economic crisis , they came to @entity137 in 2012 so he could find new work and moved to their current home in september 2013			1
council environmental health officers have told the family they must move but they will not be able to jump the queue for a council house			2
they are not eligible to be placed on the housing register as they have not been resident in the borough of @entity25 for five years			0
left behind : the @entity176 left @entity2 for @entity137 in 2012 to give their children a better life in @entity137 , where they say they will have a better education and more opportunities			1
pictured is the @entity2 capital of @entity184			2

@entity186 arrived in @entity137 from @entity2 in 2012 ' for a better life '
family of 17 *struggled* to find letting agents who would accept them
they then told a landlord , there were only six family *members*
electrician father @entity20 reportedly earns £ 1,800 a month
they say they get £ 4,600 in monthly benefits *due* to the number of children
@entity205 want a *bigger* house , but councils says they are not eligible
