junkyard : @entity1 , 56 , was fined after building up a pile of white goods in his suburban garden a rag - and - bone trader who piled old fridges and ovens into his suburban garden has been fined after his @entity9 - like hobby raised the hackles of council inspectors			1
@entity1 , 56 , cannibalised parts from the white goods to fix up other machines and sell them on - despite him being served with an enforcement notice five years earlier			1
@entity1 , who admitted being a ' lazy sod ' for not storing the goods properly , has been made to pay £ 750 for failing to clear up the junk next to his £ 130,000 semi-detached home in @entity20 , @entity21			1
magistrates heard @entity1 took parts from old washing machines , fridge freezers and microwave ovens to fix other electrical items			1
he gained so many white goods that some neighbours complained to council inspectors , who served him with a planning enforcement notice in 2009			1
despite initially complying with the order , @entity1 allowed the pile of junk to build up again and last year he again filled his front and rear gardens with washing machines and parts			1
@entity40 @entity39 fined him £ 250 and made him pay £ 500 in costs after he admitted being in breach of an council enforcement notice			1
magistrates said it was a ' serious offence committed with no regard for his neighbours '			1
@entity50 cabinet member @entity49 said : ' mr. @entity1 in effect decided to use his house as a scrap yard with no regard whatsoever for his neighbours			1
' he then compounded this by failing to comply with an enforcement notice served by the council			1
' i welcome the strong message this conviction brings , as the council will take action where people breach planning controls to protect neighbours and the environment			2
' @entity1 said after the case : ' it was my own fault and i 'm sorry for what happened			2
i lost a shed i was using so i had to put these appliances somewhere			0
tip : @entity1 said he would take the parts from the microwaves and fridge freezers to fix other white goods ' if i got two machines to take a part from one i would always keep the other one to , ' @entity1 said ' fixing washing machines and fridges is my hobby			1
when i first started i had lost my job and where i was working i used to have a unit then it shut down so i had to move it and it all came here			0
' if i got two machines to take a part from one and put it in the other i would always keep the other one too rather than throw it away , in case i needed another part			0
' ' being a lazy sod i just never got round to moving it again			1
i have paid for it now			2
' he added : ' they said it looked like i was running a business but on the first occasion i was just learning how to repair them			0
if i got a decent washer it was something else to do in case i came out of work			0
' my drive was covered in kitchen appliances at one point but it looked worse as they were due to be taken away by the scrap men the next day			0
scattered : magistrates said the hobby was a ' serious offence committed with no regard for his neighbours ' home : the junk built up in the garden of @entity1 's suburban semi in @entity20 , @entity21 ' i 'm not going to go back to doing this stuff here anymore			1
i have another place now , i 'm not that stupid			0
' despite the complaints , some neighbours sprang to @entity1 's defence			1
@entity128 said : ' @entity1 just fixes appliances			2
he has been doing it for as long as i 've lived here and that 's 16 years and it 's never bothered me			0
' every once in a while he has a couple of washing machines and maybe a dryer but he fixes them and sells them on			0
' it was n't all over the place			0
he owns the house so i do n't know why the council keep bothering him			2
' he 's a sound bloke			0
he 's very willing to help people			0
there 's never a massive amount in the garden and it 's shifted within a week			2
i got a machine off him and i 've had it for three years with no problems			0
it 's never a tip. ' some neighbours defended @entity1 , saying : ' i do n't know why the council keep bothering him ' comedy duo : @entity9 , the fictional @entity154 pair who made a living spotting gems in other people 's junk another neighbour said : ' @entity1 s a sound bloke and he does what he does , fixes machines and everyone on the estate has stuff off him			1
' everyone on the estate will vouch for him			0
it 's his own house anyway so i do n't see what the issue is			0
it seems the council can not help but stick their noses into other people 's affairs			0
' a hit comedy for the @entity154 in the 1970s , @entity9 focused on the lives of two rag - and - bone traders who scraped a living from spotting gems among other people 's junk			2
the father and son duo , who lived in west @entity184 , were constantly arguing , swore like troopers and sold their goods from a horse - drawn cart .			2

@entity1 , 56 , used his suburban garden to store fridges and ovens
he used them to fix other goods - but junk heap prompted neighbour row
council inspectors handed him enforcement notice but he ignored it
@entity39 made @entity1 , of @entity20 , @entity21 , pay £ 750
magistrates said it was ' serious offence with no regard for neighbours '
@entity1 admitted being a ' lazy sod ' but said : ' i have paid for it now '
