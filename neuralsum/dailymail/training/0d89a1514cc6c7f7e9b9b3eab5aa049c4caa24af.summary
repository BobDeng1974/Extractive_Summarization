the government is getting near - daily reports - and sometimes two or three a day - of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission , federal and industry officials tell the @entity9			1
it 's a sharp increase from just two years ago when such reports were still unusual			2
many of the reports are filed with the @entity14 by airline pilots			1
but other pilots , airport officials and local authorities often file reports as well , said the officials , who agreed to discuss the matter only on the condition that they not be named because they were n't authorized to speak publicly			2
growing trend : @entity24 launches a small drone equipped with a video camera to fly over the scene of an explosion that leveled two apartment buildings in the @entity31 neighborhood of @entity32 @entity33 , president of a drone industry trade group , said @entity14 officials also have verified the increase to him			1
while many of the reports are unconfirmed , raising the possibility that pilots may have mistaken a bird or another plane in the distance for a drone , the officials said other reports appear to be credible			2
the @entity14 tightly restricts the use of drones , which could cause a crash if one collided with a plane or was sucked into an engine			1
small drones usually are n't visible on radar to air traffic controllers , particularly if they 're made of plastic or other composites			1
' it should not be a matter of luck that keeps an airplane and a drone apart , ' said @entity62 , a training captain at a major airline and a former @entity66 safety committee chairman			0
in the way : the government is receiving reports nearly every day - and sometimes two or three times a day - of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission bird 's - eye view : a remote controlled model aircraft flies over the @entity79 spring training baseball workout in @entity80 , @entity81 ' so far we 've been lucky because if these things are operating in the sky unregulated , unmonitored and uncontrolled , the possibility of a close proximity event or even a collision has to be of huge concern			1
' the @entity14 requires that all drone operators receive permission from the agency , called a certificate of authorization , before they can fly their unmanned aircraft			1
most certificates limit drones to 400 feet in altitude and require that they remain within sight of the operator and at least five miles away from an airport			0
exceptions are made for some government drones			1
the military flies drones in great swaths of airspace in remote areas designated for military use			0
@entity109 flies high - altitude drones along the @entity112 borders with @entity113 and @entity114			2
@entity115 , who heads the @entity14 drone office , caused a stir earlier this year when he told a drone industry conference that an airliner nearly collided with a drone over @entity121 , @entity81 , in march			1
the pilot of the 50 - seat @entity123 reported the camouflage - painted drone was at an altitude of about 2,300 feet , five miles northeast of the airport			0
the @entity14 has n't been able to find the drone or identify its operator			1
in some cases the @entity14 has ' identified unsafe and unauthorized ( drone ) operations and contacted the individual operators to educate them about how they can operate safely under current regulations and laws , ' the agency said in a statement late tuesday			0
the @entity14 also said rogue operators have been threatened with fines			0
aviation safety expert @entity140 , a former @entity142 member , said he 's skeptical of some of the reports because most of the small drones currently being sold ca n't reach the altitudes cited by pilots			1
still , ' it needs to be run to ground			0
that means a real investigation , real work done to determine just what these reports mean , ' he said			0
more than one million small drones have been sold worldwide in the past few years , said @entity33 , the official with the drone industry group			1
it is inevitable that some will misuse them because they do n't understand the safety risks or simply do n't care , he said			0
' this technology has a phenomenal upside that people are still just trying to understand , ' he said			0
' as unfortunate as it would be that we have an incident , it 's not going to shut down the industry			0
' the @entity14 is expected to propose regulations before the end of the year that would allow broader commercial use of drones weighing less than 55 pounds			2
the @entity14 prohibits nearly all commercial use of drones , although that ban is being challenged			2
so far , the only commercial permits the agency has granted have been to two oil companies operating in @entity180 and seven aerial photography companies associated with movie and television production			0
but the ban has been ignored by many other drone operators , from real estate agents to urban planners to farmers who use them to monitor crops .			0
