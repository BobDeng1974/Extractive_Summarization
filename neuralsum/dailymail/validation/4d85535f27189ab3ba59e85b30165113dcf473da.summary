@entity0 , 62 , was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease			1
her grandchildren likened her appearance to the screen governess with magical powers played by @entity13			2
as a result , she was forced to pay £ 24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants			1
now mrs @entity0 , a telesales worker from @entity17 , @entity18 , has won £ 35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist , dr @entity23 , 57			1
she said : ' i had to have surgery to remove 13 teeth and eventually have implants fitted			1
' i looked like somebody who had been in a car crash			2
i had black eyes , swollen mouth and i could n't eat for a week			2
it 's ruined my life			2
i do n't want this to happen to anyone else			2
' my grandchildren would call my @entity5 when i did n't have my dentures in because i had just one tooth at the top			2
' mrs @entity0 had been a patient of dr @entity23 at the @entity17 - based @entity40 for 30 years and attended dental appointments with him every six months			1
she said : ' during these years i did n't think anything was wrong			1
i 'd get the all clear			2
' or i would say i was having problems and he would say he would have a poke around and say its fine and to see him in six months			0
' if there were problems or a tooth was twinging , he would look at it or find a cavity and say it needs filling			0
whatever he said , i believed			0
she added : ' as far as i know he did a routine check but he never told me i had gum disease			1
he never offered for me to see a hygienist			0
' the truth emerged during a holiday in 2013 with her partner when mrs @entity0 's crown fell out and she went to see a local dentist			1
to her horror , it emerged her teeth were rotting from the inside out			0
she said : ' when i went to see him the first thing he said was " when was the last time you went to the dentist ? "			1
' when i said " 3 months ago " , he said " that 's not what your teeth are telling me "			0
' i was completely shocked			0
we cut our holiday short and came home			0
' i went to another dentist close to home and they confirmed i was going to lose all my top set of teeth			1
' ' you ca n't imagine the reaction when someone tell you they will have to take all your teeth out			0
' they asked if i wanted to sit down			0
. it was a feeling that was absolutely horrendous			0
i had 13 teeth removed			0
' i also had a wisdom tooth on the bottom removed that was beyond saving and had to have an implant to replace that wisdom tooth			0
' despite paying for regular private dental treatment for 30 years , mrs @entity0 was horrified to be told by another dentist that her teeth were rotting from the inside out - and the top row would need to be removed her grandchildren likened her appearance to @entity5 , the screen governess with magical powers played by @entity13			1
mrs @entity0 , had to endure a number of deep cleaning treatments to treat the gum disease before all but four of her top set of teeth were removed			1
she said : ' i had to go through a few treatments of that			0
i have never experienced pain like that before as they clean beneath the gum line - it 's very high powered			1
it was like torture but it had to be done			0
' then i went to have my teeth extracted , all but 4 at first			0
they fitted me there and then with a partial denture			0
' ' i had to get used to something so alien in my mouth and learn how to speak again as it changes the shape of your mouth			0
i did n't want to be left with dentures for the rest of time			1
' mrs @entity0 eventually underwent implant surgery in april 2013 and had to go to the dentist every week			1
she said : ' i have spent hours at the dentists and thousands of pounds and i have only been left with around £ 11,000 for pain and suffering			1
' compensation is not a " pay out "			1
no amount of money can compensate for having lost my teeth			0
' the money i 've received will be used to cover the thousands of pounds i have paid out of my own pocket for all the necessary remedial and cosmetic work			1
' if i were n't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought , i do n't know what state my mouth would be in right now			0
' she added : ' this is all because this dentist did n't do proper checks			1
if he had done x-rays he would have known			0
' i put the time in going to the dentists and i expected to be taken care of			0
if you look at the dentists records you see check - up after check - up every 6 months			2
you just do n't expect to end up going through this			0
' ' i felt utterly betrayed by dr @entity23 when i found out the extent of the damage to my teeth and gums			0
' i 've worked hard all my life to pay for extra things in life like private dental insurance and have never missed a dentist appointment			1
mrs @entity0 was forced to pay £ 24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants			1
she has now won £ 35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist , dr @entity23 she said : ' if i were n't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought , i do n't know what state my mouth would be in right now ' ' i thought i was taking good care of my teeth and assumed that my dental insurer would have taken steps to screen its members			1
it was wrong to assume that my dentist 's inclusion on the insurance register was a quality guarantee			2
' it ruined my confidence			0
in that situation you just do n't want to go anywhere - it 's horrendous			2
it does nothing for your confidence and leaves you very self - conscious			2
' associate solicitor , @entity205 at the @entity206 which represented mrs @entity0 said : ' @entity0 's case was one of long - term mistreatment , compounded by a string of failures by her dentist dr @entity23			1
' he routinely failed to check the health of her teeth , screen for gum disease , remove decay or even carry out appropriate preventative care			1
' at no point was the patient advised of alternative treatment options or referred to specialists when her oral health started to decline			2
' dr @entity23 , who did not admit liability , refused to comment .			0
