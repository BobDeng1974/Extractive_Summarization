this photograph shows @entity1 , the archbishop of @entity2 bishops have agreed that married gay couples can ask for special prayers in the @entity6 after their wedding			1
but , under new guidelines released today , the @entity6 's @entity8 has said that gay priests will be banned from getting married despite the fact it becomes legal in the @entity12 next month			1
one @entity6 vicar , who got engaged to his partner of 14 years yesterday , has today insisted the ban will not affect him and he will go ahead with his plans despite the potential consequences			1
the new ' pastoral guidance ' comes despite the fact rules allow for those in civil partnerships to become priests and bishops if they claim to be celibate			2
and the rules state that gay non-clergy who marry can continue to receive communion within the @entity6			1
the @entity6 will not be carrying out same - sex weddings , but gay couples can ask for special prayers from their priests			1
this , though , can not be referring to as a ' blessing '			0
they must have a form of ' pastoral discussion ' , but the priest may not subject the couple to ' questioning ' about their private life			2
they say that it would be inappropriate ‘ conduct ’ for deacons , priests and bishops to enter same - sex marriage			1
and lay members who do so will be barred from ordination			0
in the guidance , the @entity8 said that clergy should be allowed to ‘ argue for a change in its teaching and human sexuality ’			1
but it added : ‘ getting married to someone of the same sex would , however , clearly be at variance with the teaching of the @entity6			2
‘ the declarations made by clergy and the canonical requirements as to their manner of life do have real significance and need to be honoured as a matter of integrity			0
’ the @entity6 said it was not allowing ‘ those who are in a same sex marriage to be ordained to any of the three orders of ministry ’			0
the rules state that gay non-clergy who marry can continue to receive communion within the @entity6 it said : ‘ in addition it considers that it would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same sex marriage , given the need for clergy to model the @entity6 ’s teaching in their lives			1
’ the prohibition of gay marriage for priests could lead to a rebellion from clergy who choose to marry after the @entity87 comes into force next month			1
local bishops would be forced to discipline them , effectively defrocking them for tying the knot			0
according to the @entity93 , the @entity6 is already preparing for ‘ martyrs ’ ready to challenge the rules			0
one man who has vowed to marry despite today 's guidelines released by the @entity8 is @entity98 , vicar at @entity100 's church in @entity101 , @entity102			1
he yesterday proposed to his boyfriend , @entity103 , for @entity104			1
‘ i woke up thinking , great i ’m engaged			2
and then i saw these new guidelines , ' he told @entity107			2
but it is not going to change anything			0
people will get married and then they will have to decide what they will then do			2
' mr @entity98 , 50 , and mr @entity103 , 40 , have been in a relationship 14 years and the vicar decided to propose ahead of the @entity87 next month			1
he said the new guidance makes the @entity6 ' even more of a laughing stock ' and described those who passed the rules as ' bullies '			0
mr @entity98 revealed that he and others had been told that they had the support of the @entity6 , and were not expecting the guidelines to be released			1
‘ to treat them like this publicly is dreadful			0
all of the bishops will know one [ a gay priest ]			2
they are telling people in private " we support you " and then publicly saying the opposite , ' he said			0
' it is absolutely shocking			0
on one level they are doing what the @entity6 did to women in the past			0
' he said that when he gets married , it will be expensive and complicated for the @entity6 to discipline him			0
mr @entity98 said he would expect to get a formal letter - a monition - acting as a public rebuke from the @entity6 , but was not sure what would happen beyond that .			0

@entity8 agrees to allow gay couples to ask for special prayers from their priest following wedding
but gay priests will be banned from getting married despite the @entity87 passing into *law* next month
church is said to be expecting rule - *breakers* , and one vicar - who got engaged to his boyfriend yesterday - has told how he will marry
