workers at the mobile giant 's site in @entity20 engaged in ' occasional incidents of banter ' to lighten up the ' somewhat mundane and repetitive ' work , the hearing in @entity16 heard			2
these included ' crop dusting ' - breaking wind near a colleague - as well as switching the language on others ' computers , swapping screens to cause confusion and taping up a computer mouse			0
but last september , things turned more serious when an employee who had his car keys stolen and his @entity37 card defaced flipped and kicked his colleague at his desk , knocking him unconscious			1
operations manager @entity3 , 37 , who had worked for the firm for almost 17 years , was sacked alongside seven others following the incident			1
but today , mrs @entity3 secured a five - figure payout for unfair dismissal after winning her employment tribunal case against @entity7			1
judge @entity43 found the mother of two , who was in charge of 11 team leaders and 111 agents , had an unblemished record and was ' clearly a highly - regarded and valued employee '			1
the tribunal heard the disgruntled employee had spoken to mrs @entity3 after his cars keys were stolen and a new @entity54 computer game inside his vehicle was taken and held for ransom			1
mrs @entity3 then told the team leader the worker was not happy and asked her to ' sort it out '			2
the employee later admitted he had had a ' sense of humour failure ' and the issue was believed to be resolved , @entity60 heard			0
but the following month , when his security pass was defaced with a permanent marker by a colleague , he kicked the man at his desk until he fell unconscious			2
tribunal : the work at the mobile giant 's site in @entity20 could be ' somewhat mundane and repetitive ' , so employees engaged in ' occasional incidents of banter ' , the hearing at @entity60 heard the attacker was immediately suspended and the next day he came to work with a three - page statement , claiming the security pass incident was the ' last straw ' and his team leader and mrs @entity3 had not taken his complaints seriously			1
following the incident , @entity7 sacked seven employees , including the victim , the kicker , the team leader and mrs @entity3			1
mobile giant : an @entity7 spokesman said the firm took its responsibilities towards its staff ' very seriously ' the firm said mrs @entity3 failed to protect the employee and breached its policy on harassment and bullying			1
but judge @entity43 found that the investigation into mrs @entity3 ’s actions had been ' wholly inadequate ' , and that her dismissal was pre-judged			1
speaking after the case , mrs @entity3 , from @entity102 , @entity16 , said the employment tribunal had been ' worth going through '			2
she said : ' it was painful but i had to stand up for myself			0
it was worth going through all of that , i can hold my head up high again with a clear record			0
that is what i wanted			0
' i did love my job , i did it well and there had not been any issues			0
' mrs @entity3 no longer has a call centre job and works in an office managing fewer people			2
today , her solicitor @entity119 , of @entity120 in @entity121 , said : ' from the outset of meeting with our client , it was evident that there were a number of failures adopted by @entity7 with their procedures			0
this should be a time for reflection on @entity7 ’s part			0
' an @entity7 spokesman said : ' we are one of the largest employers in @entity20			0
' we take our responsibilities towards our staff very seriously and have robust policies in place that ensure a zero - tolerance approach to bullying and harassment in the workplace			0
' we accept the tribunal ’s ruling			0
