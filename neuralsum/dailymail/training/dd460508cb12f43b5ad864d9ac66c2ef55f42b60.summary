by @entity0 last updated at 11:16 am on 29th december 2011 with her mane of long blonde hair , winsome smile and passing resemblance to @entity6 , she may not exactly be a dead ringer for her famous grandfather			1
but as she looks forward to sharing the stage with sir @entity11 at the @entity12 to celebrate his 70 years in showbiz , it is clear @entity14 has inherited the entertainer ’s famous drive and singing talent			1
and the 20 - year - old beauty lifted the lid on the secrets of sir @entity11 ’s longevity after joining ‘ granddad ’ for a duet on his latest album			1
generation game : @entity14 , pictured , inspired sir @entity11 who has asked her to sing with him on his forthcoming album miss @entity14 told the @entity29 that sir @entity11 - who began his showbusiness career in 1942 aged 14 - remains a perfectionist at the age of 83			1
she revealed : ' i think he must have some @entity34 [ @entity34 ] or something about wanting to get things right			1
' he ’s always worrying about stuff and wanting to get it right – and i think i get that from him as well			2
' i think that goes in his favour			2
i like to be slightly organised – but i ’m not as bad as him			2
' i do n’t think he is [ @entity34 ] at home			2
that ’s his relaxation period			2
he ’s very like that at work – but not when he ’s at home			2
there , he likes to be relaxed			2
' younger days : sophie with her grandfather sir @entity11 married three times , @entity54 host sir @entity11 has six children , nine grandchildren and an ever - expanding brood of great - grandchildren			1
miss @entity14 ’s mother , @entity60 , is no stranger to showbusiness herself			1
she was in the 1970s pop group @entity62 who appeared regularly on @entity64			2
@entity60 is one of three daughters sir @entity11 had with his first wife @entity66 , who is also a singer			1
@entity51 's mother @entity60 , pictured was a pop singer in the 1970s after @entity66 , sir @entity11 married his @entity69 hostess @entity68			1
twenty - eight years ago , he then wed former @entity71 @entity70 , whom @entity72 calls ' an absolute saint …			1
amazing , ’ adding : ‘ she ’s kept us altogether really			2
' despite the wealth of talent in the family , sir @entity11 was stunned to discover his granddaughter ’s voice			1
miss @entity14 said : ‘ it must have been a couple of years ago that i was getting demos together and my voice was starting to mature a bit			1
‘ then we were round his house and we put it on and he could n’t believe how mature i had got			2
he just remembered me as a little kid singing			2
and he thought : " oh , blimey			2
' nevertheless , miss @entity14 never imagined sir @entity11 would ask her to duet on his new album , these are my favourites			1
the pair sing together on the @entity94 favourite , @entity95			1
she admitted : ' i was walking down the road and he phoned me and asked me out of the blue			1
and i said : " @entity100 , of course i will			0
" i could n’t believe it			0
' i was very honoured			0
i never thought it would happen			0
i never expected it at all			0
' and i got a really good , really positive reaction			0
and that has given me a boost of confidence			0
he was lost for words … ' now she ’s looking forward to showcasing their duet for an audience at the @entity12 in may			1
miss @entity14 also told how despite the passing of the years , sir @entity11 continues to lead the way for the family when it comes to exercise			1
asked whether he continues to follow his renowned @entity121 exercise , she said : ' he does			1
he gets up so early			0
whenever we stay around , we always get up later than him			0
' he gets up at 6am every day and starts his exercises			0
then he has some porridge in the morning			0
he ’s already done so much stuff by the time we wake up			0
' miss @entity14 grew up between @entity126 – where her mother @entity60 and father @entity128 often worked – and @entity129			1
she is , though , now settled in @entity130 , @entity131 , and has been dating artist @entity132 for 18 months			0
miss @entity14 started singing publicly when she was 16 when her father had a ' sore throat ' and could not take to the stage			1
' my parents have been singers in @entity126 so i did tour with them and that ’s how i ’ve sort of got into it really			0
' my dad had a bad sore throat and they needed to fill some time in			0
so i was backstage helping.and mum said : ‘ quickly , help me			0
' ' so i rushed on stage and i suddenly realised i had the [ showbusiness ] bug			1
so , now i ’m sucked in that ’s really it for me			0
' many have commented on miss @entity14 ’s resemblance to @entity6 , but she said : ‘ people keep saying this [ @entity6 ] but i do n’t see it			1
i guess it ’s just the hair			0
but my favourite programme is friends			0
’ talking of her evergreen grandfather , she continued : ‘ i completely forget that he ’s 83 really			1
' to be honest i do n’t see him as a famous celebrity because he is just granddad			0
' i know that might sound strange but all the family just think of him as granddad really			0
' i never would have thought he did what he did because he just seemed so normal			0
' he is a very warm , homely granddad			0
he has had a massive role in my life			0

sir @entity11 , 83 , has asked 20 - year - old @entity14 to sing with him
