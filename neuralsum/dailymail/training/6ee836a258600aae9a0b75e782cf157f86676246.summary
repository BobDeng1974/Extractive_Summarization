by @entity0 if @entity2 manage to bring @entity3 to @entity4 , it would be the finest transfer coup of the club ’s recent history			0
@entity3 has shown in recent years , and not least at the last @entity8 , that he has the ability , the intelligence and the character to become one of football ’s great defenders			1
a ball playing centre half , @entity3 not only controls the pace of the game from the back , he can also make surging runs forward , both at set pieces and in open play			1
his pace and intelligence give him the versatility to play either in a high line or as a deep lying centre back			1
under @entity43 , he has won two @entity48 titles , a @entity49 , and reached the final of the @entity51 in 2013			2
unlike the likes of @entity53 and @entity54 , however , @entity3 is not a product of the @entity44 youth system			2
the defender learnt his trade at @entity59 , where his father was in charge of the youth system between 1995 and 2012			0
@entity59 , though , squandered @entity3 ’ talent , loaning him out to @entity44 rather than giving him first team opportunities			2
in 2009 , a permanent transfer was agreed			0
@entity3 has since shown his former club what they are missing , pipping @entity59 to several titles and vowing repeatedly never to return to the club			0
under @entity43 , who as a player also trained under @entity3 ’ father , the defender has developed into one of @entity75 ’s most impressive , modern defenders			1
he has shown his class not only in the yellow and black of @entity44 , but also in the white shirts of the national team			2
rivals : hummels came through the @entity59 youth system under his father but @entity44 have made the most of his talents @entity86 : @entity3 is @entity43 's on - field leader , and has won two @entity89 titles , a @entity49 , and made the 2013 @entity51 final with @entity44 @entity92 ’ man of the match winning performance against @entity95 at the @entity8 was his finest in a @entity29 shirt			1
it not only showed his footballing prowess , but also the strength of his will			0
he has had to fight almost incessant setbacks to establish himself under @entity102			2
match - winner : although @entity3 has separated opinion in @entity29 he proved his worth in a fine showing against @entity95 in @entity107 , capped off by the winning goal form this header just two years ago , @entity3 was public enemy number one			1
his errors in the @entity113 semi-final saw @entity29 fall embarassingly against @entity114			2
hummels , who has always radiated confidence , was vilified not only for his mistakes on the pitch , but also his vanity off it			0
he was seen as arrogant , as a player who overestimated himself			0
@entity102 seemed to share the view , and over the following years often left @entity115 out of the first team , opting instead for @entity125 ’s @entity124			1
hummels and @entity44 were so frustrated that they accused @entity102 of making it difficult for @entity44 players to succeed internationally			1
after finally regaining @entity102 ’s trust with a goal against @entity114 last autumn , @entity3 then suffered an almost season ending injury , which looked set to shatter his @entity8 chances			1
but the @entity44 defender fought back			1
his performances at the @entity8 were repeatedly brilliant , often being the only man to prevent @entity29 ’s wobbly defence from collapse			1
if @entity3 ’ international career shows one thing , it is that he has an immense desire to prove himself on every single stage			0
he has not only the quality to boost @entity2 ’s defence , but also the character to assimilate very quickly into @entity147 football			0
team player : after being perceived as arrogant in his own country @entity3 has won fans and @entity102 over home comforts : @entity3 is embraced by his partner @entity152 after the final at the @entity154 whether he will leave @entity44 is another matter			1
when he extended his contract until 2017 two years ago , @entity3 refused to add in a buyout clause , on the grounds that he did not want to leave the club on bad terms			0
his relationship to @entity44 and to @entity43 is very strong			1
it will take @entity163 a huge amount of persuasion to tempt the player to @entity167			2
if he manages it , though , @entity2 fans may rejoice			0
@entity92 ’ quality is out of the question			0
his character , meanwhile , means that you can never ever write him off			0
@entity174 keen on @entity115 and will continue to spend - @entity175			0

@entity44 and @entity29 defender is a target for @entity163
the ball - playing centre half is fast , smart and *dangerous* from set pieces
@entity44 manager @entity43 says he wo **n't** let him go
@entity185 has a hole at the back after @entity187 and @entity188 left
hummels *replaced* @entity124 in @entity29 's starting line - up during the @entity8 on their way to *victory* in @entity107
he was once viewed as arrogant and @entity102 did **n't** rate him
