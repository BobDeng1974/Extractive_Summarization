by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 03:27 est , 22 march 2013 from fad diets to savvy gadgets , there are hundred of products claiming to aid weight loss			0
when zero noodles were unveiled recently an army of health - conscious dieters were quick to snap them up - many going as far as describing the eight - calorie - per - portion food as the ' @entity13 ' of dieting			2
but now , experts claim they have created a ' revolutionary ' weight loss approach that is set to knock zero noodles to the back of the shelf			1
new weight loss craze : experts are claiming that @entity21 are the latest diet craze , but are they really a healthy way to shed the pounds ? @entity24 , a new weight loss drink , has been likened to a ' gastric band in a glass ' , due to the drink ’s hunger busting properties			1
experts are raving about the 40 calorie drink because of what they claim to be a ' miracle ingredient ' within it			1
this magic supplement , called @entity37 , is an ingredient that expands in the stomach to provide an instant feeling of fullness and desperate dieters are turning to @entity21 as a last ditch attempt before enduring expensive surgery			1
@entity37 , a natural ingredient derived from a plant native to @entity47 and palm oil and oat oil , supposedly provides a long lasting feeling of fullness			1
supported by numerous clinical studies , @entity37 provides a physical reaction in the stomach making the eater feel full very quickly , then after 3 - 4 hours the palm oil and oat oil get to work , fooling the brain and body into thinking there ’s still fat to digest , which prevents the hunger signals that normally see us reaching for snacks in between meals			1
' miracle ' ingredient : the new product maintains that it 's the new zero noodle because it claims to contain a ' miracle ' ingredient that expands in your stomach available in @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , each sachet has to be mixed with water and drunk three times a day before meals			1
the sachets are sold at @entity79 for £ 24.99 and have seen a predictably huge response			0
but is is this ' miracle ' drink too good to be true ? personal trainer and nutritionist @entity83 , who has worked with the likes of @entity86 , said : ' this is just another high fibre " quick fix " product which claims to make the stomach feel full quickly			2
' there appears to be no stimulants and the side effects can cause flatulence and mild irregularity especially if you are not use to a high fibre diet			0
' if the appetite is reduced and insufficient energy calories are cut then exercise - which is the best way to permanently lose weight and keep healthy - may not be performed due to reduced energy levels			0
' personally rather than " sitting in the chair " drinking " quick fix " products , which will not increase your lean body tissue muscle , why not get up and exercise go for a power walk , jog or run , which will lead to a healthier body and stronger mind which will permanently keep your body and mind healthy without any ' smelly ' odours '			0
simple ! ' ' people turn to such things because they want a quick fix but its long term properties are unknown and unlikely to be good			0
slim sticks that provide a ' physical reaction in the stomach ' are tricking our body it 's long term health benefits will not be good			2
' slim sticks are a craze , they will not sustain a healthy lifestyle			0
if you want to lose weight , do it gradually and with the right guidance , ' added big brother star and personal trainer @entity136 .			0
