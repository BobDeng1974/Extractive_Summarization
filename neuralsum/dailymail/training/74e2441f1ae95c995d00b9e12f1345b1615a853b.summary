by @entity0 published : 13:05 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 14:12 est , 31 july 2012 the @entity2 @entity1 in @entity4 's capital was evacuated today after a suspected bomb was spotted on one of its official vehicles , just a year after the @entity10 massacre			1
but the discovery – which sparked a full - scale security alert - was actually a training device mistakenly left attached to the car after a @entity2 security exercise in @entity16			1
it triggered a security alert which led to the special forces being deployed and a 550 yard cordon around the embassy , which was evacuated along with other buildings			1
the evacuation covered buildings within a 500 - metre radius of the @entity1 , pictured , and included the @entity26 , though no one from the royal family was there police also shut underground rail lines and brought in heavily armed special forces after the fake bomb was spotted during a routine check			1
it comes just one year after police were criticised for reacting too slowly when gunman @entity10 bombed @entity37 buildings in @entity16 , before going on a killing rampage			2
last month a ten - week trial into the killings concluded , during which @entity10 admitted killing 77 people and injuring 242 on july 22 last year , but denied charges of terrorism and premeditated murder			0
the court heard from the 33 - year - old who said he ' acted to stop a @entity49 invasion ' to ' defend the indigenous @entity4 people '			0
th prosecution has asked that he be deemed insane			0
a decision is expected next month			0
the 32 - year - old @entity4 confessed to setting off the car bomb that killed eight people in downtown @entity16 , before gunning down scores of youth from the left - leaning @entity58 at their annual retreat on an island north - west of the capital			2
police have blocked off the area around the castle , pictured , after the discovery of the suspicious object , which turned out to be a training device the bomb scare comes a year after @entity37 buildings were targeted by @entity10 , killing eight people a police statement today said : ‘ our bomb squad removed the object and found that it was a practice bomb which was previously used for an internal exercise at the embassy , ’ the @entity2 @entity1 declined to comment , but will no doubt face tough questions about how the mistake was able to happen , particularly at a time when memories of last year 's shocking attack are still fresh in the memories of @entity4 's residents			1
the embassy is planning to relocate due to security reasons to the outskirts of @entity16 from its current location adjacent to the royal palace and near the foreign ministry			0
