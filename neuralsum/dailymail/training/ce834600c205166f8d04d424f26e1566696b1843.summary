by @entity0 @entity2 's players had a first chance to impress @entity4 when they reported back for pre-season training on wednesday - but @entity6 failed to show for the first day under their new boss			1
the @entity8 cast his eye over his squad after taking over from @entity11 in the summer			1
a handful of the players also took part in testing at @entity15 , but @entity6 was absent from the group citing medical reasons			1
video : scroll down to see @entity2 players put through their paces at @entity15 tough start : @entity22 was one of the players who underwent fitness testing taking a breather : @entity26 has a break from the medical tests @entity22 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 were put through their paces and were clearly feeling the strain if these pictures are anything to go by			1
' it was difficult , ' @entity22 told the club 's website			2
' obviously vo2 max means you run to your maximum and you ca n’t run anymore , so it ’s difficult			2
it stands us in good stead to go and tackle the rest of pre-season and the season beyond			0
pushed to the limit : the @entity2 players hit the ground running on day one blowing : @entity30 takes a well - earned rest ' in midfield you ’ve got to be able to do a bit of both			1
you ’ve got to get in the box to score goals and get back to defend			2
it ’s a very physical , demanding position but that ’s why i enjoy it			0
' @entity29 added : ' it was hard			0
we do it nearly every season and i thought with the new gaffer coming in we might dodge it this year and get away with not having to do it ! ' it ’s one thing that keeps me motivated in pre-season to try and do some work because i know the first thing i ’m going to do is have something like that to test me straight away			0
it ’s hard but it helps us with all the data			0
sizing them up : @entity80 is measured by a member of the medical team thumbs up : @entity32 prepares to get checked out ' i think it ’s more just to test what level we ’re at			2
everyone seems to do alright			0
everyone seems to finish on the same level			0
' you get some a little bit higher and some a little bit lower			0
it tests our heart rates to see how we can work through the season			0
' however , @entity6 did himself no favours			1
the @entity98 , who is a target for @entity100 and @entity101 , managed just three goals in nine starts for the @entity2 since his £ 15million move from @entity105 last summer and failed to impress out on loan at @entity107			1
no show : @entity6 did n't turn up to pre-season training saints bound : @entity4 is closing in on @entity112 striker @entity111 meanwhile , @entity2 expect to sign @entity111 , 28 , from @entity112 after improving their bid to £ 7million plus ad - ons .			1
