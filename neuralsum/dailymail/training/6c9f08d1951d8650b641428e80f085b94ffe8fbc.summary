@entity0 has been and gone in a flash , and my main focus has of course been on the beauty trends			1
from bold brights at @entity6 and glossy minimalism at @entity8 to the downright kooky pastel - painted brows at @entity11 , i can safely say i 'm now stocked up on some serious beauty as well as fashion inspiration			1
one of my favourite beauty looks from the @entity16 shows came from @entity17 , who sent their models down the catwalk in floaty festival florals , led by the gorgeous @entity22			1
@entity40 , @entity41 and i appeared on a special edition of @entity44 last week , where i went for a very similar beauty look featuring a 60s style eye and peachy lip			1
it 's a timeless look that 's both wearable and bang on trend - here 's how to get it : @entity25 took inspiration from the @entity16 show that saw @entity22 take to the runway get the look the base first , create a velvety - smooth base by spritzing a layer of @entity58 onto your face and buffing in with a foundation brush			1
the super-light , silky formulation airbrushes away blemishes whilst giving the complexion a radiant glow for a flawless , catwalk - ready finish			2
@entity25 says that it is important to get a velvety smooth base to create a soft natural look @entity25 has opted for soft peachy tones for a subtle spring time look the eyes start by applying a neutral taupe or beige shadow like @entity77 in @entity78			1
use a fluffy brush to blend the shadow all over your eyelids , to subtly define your socket line and disguise any discolouration on the lid			0
next , for a sleek and streamlined eye , flick a liquid liner like @entity87 across your upper lash line			0
follow up with generous lashings of @entity90 on your top and bottom lashes			2
add a touch of nonchalant rock - chick definition to your lower lash line by wiggling the brush over the lash right from the root			0
@entity25 's make - up this week is made up of peachy tones so can be worn during the day backstage at @entity17 where feminine florals took centre stage gently fill in your brows with the @entity105 , warming the nib with your fingers so the colour looks soft and natural			1
use the handy brush on the other end of the pencil to blend the colour into your brows , brushing in light upward strokes for a fashion - forward , full finish			0
the contour brush a slight dusting of @entity118 just under the cheekbones to add some some warmth and definition to your face			0
for a subtly radiant glow , sweep a touch of @entity125 across the tops of your cheekbones			0
@entity25 's calender is released in just a few weeks and apparently much of it involves shots of the reality star in her underwear the lips finally , add a pretty pop of coral - pink colour to your lips with @entity139 in @entity140			1
use a lip brush to apply the colour in a light , sheer layer , giving your pout a natural flush			0
to fake a @entity147 - style full pout , dab a slick of @entity149 on to the centre of your lips			0
i also wanted to tell you some exciting news â€“ my 2015 calendar is going to be released in just a few short weeks ! i 've been finalising the images for each month , and i can reveal that quite a few more pics of me in my favourite lingerie by @entity158 made the cut			2
stay beautiful , @entity161 xxx			2
