by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 05:46 est , 6 december 2012 a hospital was yesterday accused of secretly placing a 68 - year - old musician on the @entity3 after launching a court battle against his family			1
@entity6 was admitted to hospital with constipation last may but contracted pneumonia and had to be transferred to intensive care			2
the married grandfather has remained there since , suffering severe infections , the near failure of his kidneys , a stroke and a heart attack			1
plea : relatives of grandfather @entity6 , pictured at @entity19 this year , are in a legal battle with a hospital trust that wants to withdraw his treatment yesterday the trust launched a rare legal bid to withdraw ‘ aggressive ’ treatment of mr @entity6 , arguing the pain and distress it caused him were out of proportion to his tiny chances of recovery			1
but his wife and children challenged the application , saying they were able to communicate with him by lip - reading and blaming his deterioration on being placed on the controversial pathway , something the hospital – which can not be named for legal reasons – denies			2
daughter @entity46 , 48 , told the @entity47 : ‘ i ’ve always believed that from about when @entity49 was ventilated , he was put on the @entity3			2
i believe he ’s been put on and taken off , put on and taken off			0
i do believe the pathway has n’t worked , that ’s why he keeps bouncing back			0
’ she said she could lip - read her father asking ‘ why are n’t you in work ? ’ when she visited him in the morning , and suggested the hospital was taking action because he had been on the unit for so long			2
miss @entity46 added : ‘ there ’s never been a diagnosis made – @entity49 has been seven months on the critical care unit			0
i just think he ’s been there too long			0
’ she accused doctors of worsening his condition by refusing to give him fluids , adding : ‘ we ’ve never seen him in pain , we ’ve never seen him grimace			0
’ family : mr @entity6 ' wife may , left , and their daughter @entity73 , right , insist the 68 - year - old musician - who is unable to speak following a tracheotomy - would want to persevere with treatment mr @entity6 , a well - known guitarist who played on the 1974 hit @entity78 by @entity79 , overcame bowel cancer ten years ago			1
in may he was admitted to the hospital and initially seemed to be doing well			0
however later that month he became critically ill after contracting pneumonia and was transferred to intensive care			0
doctors warned his family he was unlikely to survive , but despite suffering multiple organ failure and needing constant monitoring for low blood pressure , he is still in the hospital ’s critical care unit			2
he can not speak after having a tracheotomy and the trust does not accept he is capable of expressing his wishes in any other way			0
' we 've never seen him in pain , we 've never seen him grimace ' @entity6 ' daughter @entity73 yesterday the trust went to court seeking permission to stop giving mr @entity6 medication to raise his blood pressure , dialysis for his kidneys or cardiopulmonary resuscitation if he suffers a heart attack			1
the court heard that if the judge agrees , mr @entity6 will suffer further infections , slip into a coma and die			1
an independent intensive care consultant who has examined mr @entity6 for the @entity114 – who is acting on his behalf – has backed the hospital ’s argument that he is in distress and has no realistic prospect of recovery			1
but in emotional evidence his family yesterday told the court they did not believe the doctors and insisted he smiled when they visited and enjoyed reading the newspaper , listening to music and seeing his grandchildren			0
mr @entity6 ’s wife may , 67 , who celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary at his bedside in september , said he sat up and read a newspaper just this week			1
she said when he was diagnosed with bowel cancer , his attitude was : ‘ this is n’t going to beat me			0
’ asked what he would say to doctors who wanted to withdraw treatment now , she said : ‘ he would feel exactly the same			2
’ earlier the court heard from a consultant treating mr @entity6 , who can be referred to only as dr g , who said : ‘ i can unequivocally state we ’ve never used or considered using the @entity3 in mr @entity6 ’s case			1
’ independent doctor @entity146 examined mr @entity6 and confirmed that he was only minimally conscious			1
he said his chances of recovery were less than 1 per cent			0

@entity6 , 68 , has suffered a host of health *problems* including pneumonia , a stroke , and a heart attack
the musician *'s* family has accused the hospital treating him of secretly placing him on the @entity3
the *unidentified* hospital - which denies the claim - has launched a rare legal bid to withdraw mr @entity6 ' treatment
the trust has argued the medication is causing the patient distress that is out of proportion to his limited chances of recovery
