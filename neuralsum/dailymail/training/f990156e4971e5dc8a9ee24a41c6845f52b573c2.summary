by @entity0 for @entity1 billionaire mp @entity2 has been forced into an embarrassing backdown over his controversial comments towards ' @entity6 mongrels ' and ' @entity6 b * * * ards ' , by delivering a letter of apology to the @entity6 ambassador today			1
after coming under increasing fire for his bizarre rant last monday night , mr @entity2 's has delivered a letter to ' his excellency mr @entity15 '			2
in it he says : ' i most sincerely apologise for any insult to the @entity6 people caused by any of the language i used during my appearance on the @entity23 television program @entity22			1
' he went on to say that ' we always must have an open mind ' and that ' i now come to the realisation that what i said on @entity22 was an insult to @entity6 people everywhere and i wish to assure them they have my most genuine and sincerely apology , that i am sorry that i said the things i said on the program			1
' @entity2 had said about the @entity6 that ' they 're communist , they shoot their own people , they have n't got a justice system and they want to take over this country ' , now he says sorry and that ' it is in the interest of the whole world that @entity51 and @entity6 have good relations '			1
@entity2 in the middle of that rant on @entity55 against the @entity6			1
today he 's done a complete backflip , apologising in a letter to the @entity6 ambassador , conceding he had insulted " @entity6 people everywhere ' friends again			1
this is a picture from back in 2009 where @entity2 and @entity61 of @entity6 celebrated the @entity6 first mining venture			2
he also added that ' it is in the interest of the whole world that @entity51 and @entity6 have good relations '			2
mr @entity2 had been roundly criticised for the rant and his comments labelled ' racist '			0
several community leaders and @entity67 said the tirade could hurt @entity51 's trade relationship with @entity6			1
the @entity71 leader tried to appease those critics by suggesting his comments were directed against @entity73 , with whom he 's locked in a series of legal disputes , even going as far as tweeting his position			1
@entity2 tried to fend off claims he was racist after the rant last monday by saying on @entity80 that the comments were aimed at a @entity6 company only @entity73 has accused mr @entity2 of using $ 12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013			2
the verbal spray included him calling @entity6 people ' bastards ' and ' mongrels ' who ' shoot their own people '			1
' the @entity6 government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free			0
so far they 've shifted $ 200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it			0
i do n't mind standing up against the @entity6 bastards and stop them from doing it , ' he said			0
he then claimed he was owed ' about $ 500 million by the communist @entity6 government			0
' ' we 'll be suing them and they 'll be answering the questions			0
we 've had ... an arbitration against these @entity6 mongrels - i 'm saying that because they 're communist , they shoot their own people , they have n't got a justice system and they want to take over this country			2
and we 're not going to let them , ' he said			0
in an attempt to smooth things over , foreign minister @entity119 told the @entity6 embassy that ' these were the comments of one member of @entity125 and not representative '			0
the @entity127 also chimed in by calling them ' over the top , shrill and wrong '			0
mr @entity2 will hope his letter of apology will bring to an end a forgettable fortnight for his party with his problems exacerbated by star @entity137 recruit @entity136 being forced to fend off plagiarism claims and @entity140 's suggestions @entity51 needed to significantly boost its military presence or risk ' letting our grandchildren become slaves ' .			0

the @entity71 leader has written a letter of apology to the @entity6 ambassador
said he had ' come to the realisation that what i said was an insult to @entity6 people everywhere '
added that he was sorry and that he ' regretted any hurt or anguish '
he *'d* been labelled ' racist ' for the tirade delivered on @entity55 last week
