her dark hair piled in a stylish bun atop her head and resplendent in a black and silver salwar kameez , @entity5 , from @entity6 , looks every inch the glamorous working mother			1
but while @entity5 might not look unusual , her second marriage was anything but			1
for , like many thousands more , the mother - of - eight was once a ' co-wife ' to a polygamous husband			1
yet despite being open to the idea of a second polygamous union , @entity5 admits that her first did n't exactly go to plan			1
divorced : @entity5 recently divorced her second husband whom she shared with a co-wife ' i met him at a car wash , ' she beams , remembering the day she met the man who would become her second husband			1
' i went to clean my car and came back with a husband			2
everyone always jokes that i should n't be allowed to go to a car wash in case i end up married again ! ' then a single mother following the break - up of her first marriage to a @entity29 cousin , @entity5 says she was looking for companionship and a ' stable family life '			1
what she got was something quite different , with her @entity36 @entity35 husband spending a total of just six months in her company over their 10 - year marriage			1
' the second marriage really suited me at first , ' she explains			2
' i had seven children , some with special needs , and i just wanted to have a husband			1
not much time : @entity5 says she did n't get to spend as much time with her husband as she expected to commonplace : an estimated 20,000 polygamous families live in the @entity36 , even though it is illegal under @entity36 law ' we were really similar ; there were only six months between us			1
we had both been married before and we had the same level of thinking			0
' i did n't want to be on my own , i wanted support			0
a part - time marriage really suited me			2
' and @entity5 is certainly not the only woman to think so , with an estimated 20,000 polygamous marriages estimated to exist in the @entity36 alone - nearly all of which are between @entity35			1
worldwide , an estimated five per cent of @entity35 marriages are multiple ones , an arrangement endorsed by verse 4:3 of the @entity64 which states : ' marry of the women , who seem good to you , two or three or four ; and if ye fear that ye can not do justice to so many then one only			0
' among those to follow its dictates is @entity73 's @entity72 who has two wives : his first cousin @entity75 and @entity77 's princess @entity76			0
famous marriages : @entity73 's @entity72 ( left ) has two wives while @entity80 of @entity77 had four not so glamorous : despite trying for more than a decade , @entity5 's polygamous marriage was disappointing indeed , princess @entity76 is herself the child of a polygamous match with her father , the late king hussein of jordan , taking no fewer than four wives , among them the @entity36 - born @entity87			1
but glamorous though the lives of @entity76 and the @entity77 consorts are , for @entity5 , struggling to raise a large family in @entity6 , the reality was quite different			1
so too was her relationship with her husband 's first wife , which she had hoped would be ' like @entity96 ' but in reality , was plagued by tension and jealousy			2
' initially i did n't have any contact with his first wife , ' she explains			0
' i think she was fairly upset when she first found out that we had got married			0
' not that @entity5 was particularly bothered by that			2
' she ca n't really argue about it as her mother was a second wife , ' she adds			2
' so if she ever says anything i just say : " well why did your father remarry ? " ' so why did he ? according to @entity5 , second , third and even fourth marriages are made for one reason alone - because the man is n't happy with the wife he has			1
appearance : like this @entity6 family , @entity5 will appear on @entity119 's @entity118 with many wives tonight looking for love : @entity5 says she would like to find another husband - even if he already has a wife ' men are polygamous by nature , ' she insists			1
' that 's just life			0
i 'm not a jealous person at all , i have a big heart and i 'm willing to give			0
' i think the purpose of the second wife is to meet the needs of the husband that perhaps he is n't getting from the first wife			2
' is n't this better than him having an affair and coming back and giving you chlamydia ? ' despite @entity5 's desire to make her husband happy , things did n't work out quite as she had hoped with her husband spending at most a couple of hours a week at her home , instead of the three to four days they had originally agreed upon			1
after a decade of feeling alone , she decided to end the relationship , making the move herself on the grounds that ' it was easier for me to walk away than him '			0
now single once again , @entity5 has n't entirely given up hope of finding love again and says she would even consider another polygamous match should the right one come along			1
' i think that a marriage is like a cake , ' she explains			0
' if you put in rubbish ingredients , it wo n't be any good but if you put in beautiful ingredients , you will get a beautiful cake			0
' key to making @entity5 's ' beautiful cake ' is finding sympathetic co-wives who understand the situation and wo n't get jealous			2
' i would like to find a co-wife who is similar to me , ' she smiles			0
' i hear these stories of these co-wives where there are three or four of them and they are best friends like the @entity96 girls			0
' they share the responsibilities and do n't chase one another down , stick in hand			0
this is what breaks the man down mentally			0
i just want to be the best wife i can			0
