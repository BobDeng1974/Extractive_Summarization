over the years , i have used many weapons in my battle against frizz			2
there have been the straighteners and the steaming tongs , which looked — and felt — like medieval instruments of torture , not to mention the bucketloads of serums , quenching masks and elasticisers , all promising to transform my fine , fly - away hair into sleek , glossy locks			1
yet it seems the search for perfect hair is still so elusive that , in the 21st century , we are resorting to physics			2
indeed , if professor @entity22 ever designed a hairbrush , the @entity21 would be it			0
at first glance , it looks like a normal hairbrush			0
however , in the middle of the head is a hole , inside of which are two tiny sets of bristles , which emit a cloud of negatively charged atoms , or ions			0
air - conditioning , pollution and man - made fibres can all cause a build - up of static electricity in hair , as can brushing and towel drying — making it difficult to keep your style neat and under control			1
@entity21 — made by @entity61 and selling for £ 30 — is said to help because the ions neutralise the static charge , thus smoothing the hair			1
so far the reception has been rapturous			0
one reviewer described it as ‘ a blow - dry in a brush ’			1
another hailed it as a ‘ brush with genius ’			2
a husband , who bought the product for his wife on the @entity78 website , even credits it with improving his marriage , declaring : ‘ a happy wife is a happy life			0
’ the @entity61 brush claims to work wonders by changing the static charge in your hair and stops it going frizzy so does the brush live up to the hype ? i admit straight away that science was never my strong point at school			1
but even i could discover an interest in particle physics if it means no more bad hair days or expensive blow - dries			1
the claims that this brush changes the static charge in your hair and stops it going too frizzy seems fine , but considering my fine , wavy hair seems to defy the laws of @entity107 , could it work for me ? the handle contains a compartment for two aa batteries , which i fit right away			1
as i have no idea what to expect , i press the ‘ on ’ switch with some trepidation			0
@entity116 women spend ten minutes a day , or ten days a year , brushing their hair at first nothing seems to happen			1
a yellow light appears to indicate the brush is working , but it is eerily silent			2
there is none of the usual vibrating , heating or twirling you expect from hair gadgets			0
i inspect the ionic generators more closely and press the brush to my ear — and realise it is making a very faint crackling noise			0
when i begin brushing my hair , all doubts disappear			0
normally my hair is so dry and coarse that i have to drag a brush through it , but this glides effortlessly through to the ends			1
my tresses seem instantly softer and smoother without the help of any sprays or serums			0
i wo n’t say it ’s ‘ a blow - dry in a brush ’ , but my hair certainly has no right to look this good after so little effort			1
i am so intrigued that i turn ‘ mad scientist ’ to test the theory behind the brush			0
using a balloon left over from my daughter @entity151 ’s ninth birthday party , i frantically rub the side of my head to generate an electrical charge and get my hair standing on end			1
the brush even conquers this frizz			2
still , so much for the lab. what about real life ? when i put the brush to the test again the next morning , i find it helps master my bed - head quicker than usual			1
@entity166 ( pictured ) is a fan of the brush , and says : ' this gadget still costs less than a good - quality bristle brush , and it definitely saves loads of money on hair serums and smoothers ' @entity166 ran rigorous tests to see just how good the brush is			1
she used a balloon to frantically rub the side of her head to generate an electrical charge and get my hair standing on end - which the brush managed to calm in the evening , i have to attend an event at a posh restaurant			1
after a hard day rushing around , my hair is far from red - carpet ready			2
when i first used the brush , my hair had been blow - dried eight hours earlier			1
this time it has a different effect , reinstating the soft curls i had in the morning and making them look sleeker and smoother			0
@entity151 , who loves watching me do my hair , pays me the ultimate compliment by telling me , completely unsolicited , that i look like i ’ve been to the hair salon			0
a few days later i wash my hair again and leave it completely as nature intended			2
as expected , it goes to frizz , the default position if my locks are not teased , coerced and forced to behave			0
they then look even worse — bushy as well as frizzy — after i get caught in a shower while walking the dog			0
@entity166 ( pictured ) with the right half her hair brushed with @entity61 brush and the left half not			1
@entity166 says : ' i pass my hands over my hair , it feels as smooth as if i 'd been plastering it in a conditioning mask ' when i get home i brush them with my new secret weapon for five minutes			2
this time , it still manages to smooth down my hair , but it ca n’t create the shape or volume of a blow - dry			2
however , when i pass my hands over my hair , it feels as smooth as if i ’d been plastering it in a conditioning mask			0
one of the downsides of the brush is that it would be easy to leave it switched on in the rush of getting ready to go out , and the batteries would run down			0
but at £ 30 , this gadget still costs less than a good - quality bristle brush , and it definitely saves loads of money on hair serums and smoothers			1
long ago i learned that i can never feel truly in control of my life unless i am in control of my hair — and every little helps			1
for that reason alone , the @entity21 is a welcome addition to my armoury .			0

the @entity61 battery - powered brush could be the end of bad hair days
it sends out microscopic particles , which claim to fight frizz
the £ 30 brush helps make your hair feel smoother
