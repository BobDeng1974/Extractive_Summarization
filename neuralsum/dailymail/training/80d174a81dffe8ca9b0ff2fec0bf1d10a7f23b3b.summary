by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 12:26 est , 16 october 2012 tonight 's grand final of the @entity2 is expected to draw over four million viewers			1
not bad for a genteel @entity4 show about cakes			0
the show has become one of @entity4 ’s biggest success stories with a peak of 4.6 million tuning in each week to see presenters @entity11 and @entity13 and judges @entity14 and @entity16 whip up a tv storm			2
the show has been credited with making baking cool again , and reminding boys where the kitchen is ( tonight 's final is all male and judge @entity14 's heartthrob status continues to soar )			0
but @entity25 's love of baking is n't really new at all - just ask your grandmother			0
the trend for home baking has been in and out of vogue many times over the last century from the launch of @entity33 in the 1920s to the introduction of tv chefs @entity37 in the 1950s , the last century has seen the popularity of baking rise and fall according to social and economic trends			1
today 's thrifty climate means that we are enjoying home comforts as well as needing to stretch our bank accounts while in the 1930s the increasing popularity of cars and therefore picnics caused a boom in baking , and in the 1980s celebrity chef @entity50 stirred our passions for the kitchen with her ' how to @entity54 ' book			2
factors contributing to the decline in home baking over the century include women going to work in the 1910s , rationing in the 1940s and mass produced processed food arriving in homes in the 1960s			1
to celebrate @entity66 ( which runs from 15th - 21st october ) and the @entity2 off final kitchen appliance company @entity67 has compiled a time line of baking trends with help from @entity71 , archivist from @entity75 's oldest weekly women 's magazine @entity76 , and dr @entity77 , a food historian			1
dr @entity79 says : ' baking trends are essentially uneven			0
some people will always bake , especially in places with a long - standing tradition such as @entity84 , but fashion also has a huge influence			0
in the current economic climate , an increase in baking at home by those who discover and enjoy the craft provides a logical way of economising during hard times			0
