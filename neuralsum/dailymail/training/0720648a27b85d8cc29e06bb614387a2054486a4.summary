by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 01:00 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 06:23 est , 11 september 2013 an @entity4 man who died in february under suspicious circumstances had a heart attack and did not spontaneously combust as some at first believed			1
@entity7 , 65 , of @entity8 died after burning for 10 hours			1
when his house was found largely untouched by the fire , some began to suspect spontaneous combustion			1
now investigators say @entity7 died of a heart attack and likely fell on top of a cigarette , lighting himself on fire , thereafter			1
nothing to see here : @entity7 died in this @entity21 house early this year			1
initially , some believed he spontaneously combusted when he was found burned with his home unharmed after neighbors saw smoke coming from the house they called the fire service and attempted to put out what they thought was a pile of burning trash			1
they soon realized it was in fact a body			1
@entity35 county sheriff @entity34 said : ' this is very bizarre			1
you ’re thinking someone poured something on him , but there was no fire source			1
the body was burned and it was incinerated			2
i think there is only about 200 cases ( of spontaneous combustion ) worldwide			2
i 'm not saying this is what it is , but i have n't ruled it out			1
' wrong : sheriff @entity34 said the way his body was burned was inconsistent with an accidental fire - such as from a cigarette dropping @entity54 : the floor below the 65 - year - old was not damaged and there was no sign that any accelerant was used sheriff @entity34 spent about 20 years as an arson investigator for the @entity61 , @entity63 @entity62 , and said he had never seen anything like it			2
the floor below the 65 - year - old was not damaged and there was no sign that any accelerant was used			2
on tuesday , @entity34 ’s suspicions were discounted , reports @entity71			1
‘ the lack of soot within the airway and a negative carboxyhemoglobin level within the procured blood sample suggests death prior to the fire , ’ reads the medical examiner ’s report			1
‘ these findings are not consistent with someone breathing in smoke in the moments preceding death			1
’ the report also noted @entity7 ’s advanced coronary artery disease and heavy smoking habit			1
authorities said the man had a history of heavy drinking and smoking , according to @entity94			2
@entity95 : @entity96 was found enveloped in blue flames in december 1956			2
by the time firemen arrived on the scene , @entity96 and his easy chair were ashes			2
strangely enough , nearby curtains and clothing were untouched by fire the remains of mrs @entity106 , left , which were largely ashes , were found among the remains of a chair in which she had been sitting , right , and only part of her left footand her backbone remained , below limbs : the remains of mrs @entity113 remains after she allegedly spontaneously decombusted a baffled coroner ruled last year that a man who burned to death in his home died as a result of spontaneous human combustion			1
dr @entity120 , the coroner for @entity121 in @entity122 , said that although @entity124 , 76 , had been found lying on his back close to a fire in an open fireplace , that blaze had not caused his death			1
he said a detailed investigation into all other possibilities had offered no other explanation , so he was delivering such a verdict for the first time in his 25 years as a coroner			2
in december 1956 , @entity135 of @entity136 , @entity95 , walked into the room of @entity96 to find him enveloped in blue flames			2
by the time firemen arrived on the scene , @entity96 and his easy chair were ashes but nearby curtains and clothing were untouched by fire , in spite of the fierce heat that would have been necessary to consume a human being			2
on july 2 , 1951 , mrs @entity149 's remains , which were largely ashes , were found among the remains of a chair in which she had been sitting			1
only part of her left foot and her backbone remained			0
plastic household objects at a distance from the seat of the fire were softened and had lost their shapes			0
the @entity161 eventually declared that @entity106 had been incinerated by the ' wick effec't			0
as she was a known user of sleeping pills , they hypothesized that she had fallen unconscious while smoking and set fire to her nightclothes			0
the theory of the wicker effect is that the human body can become an ' inside out ' candle			0
the person ’s clothes are the wick , while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance , that keeps the blaze going			0
limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient , with the bottom half of the body being cooler than the top			0
there have been a number of documented cases where police have found corpses burned almost to ashes but no burned furniture around them			0
temperatures of 3,000 degrees would be required to burn a human body to this extent , yet in these cases only smoke damage is reported			0
puzzled scientists have come up with the ‘ wick theory ’ to explain such events			0
the theory is that the human body can become an ‘ inside out ’ candle			0
the person ’s clothes are the wick , while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance , that keeps the blaze going			0
limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient , with the bottom half of the body being cooler than the top			0
a grisly aside is that greasy stains left after such an event could be a residue for the person ’s body fat			0
the combustion would not be ‘ spontaneous ’ however , because it would need an external source to start it off , such as a cigarette			0
some have postulated that static electricity could cause the needed spark			0
a body would take around five hours to burn in this way to ashes			0
victims are often elderly , sick , or under the influence of alcohol , which might explain why they would not have been able to escape			0
@entity229 provides a very graphic depiction of the death of the shopkeeper mr @entity232 by spontaneous combustion in his 1852 novel @entity235 , where the author does away with the alcoholic rag - and - bone man @entity232 by making him mysteriously burst into flames			1
@entity229 had done his research : in the 1850s , the main theory used to explain these occurrences was alcohol — that , if you drank enough , it seeped into your skin and made it possible to catch alight if you brushed past a flame .			0

@entity7 's february death was considered suspicious coroners ruled tuesday he died a natural death
