by @entity0 published : 13:34 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 04:10 est , 23 january 2013 one of @entity2 's biggest frozen food makers has been partly blamed for a massive new landslip which has brought homes within feet of crumbling cliffs			1
the coastal community of @entity7 - 500ft above sea level - has been besieged by landslides since 2008 , when the first wave led to three homes having to be bulldozed before they fell down the cliffs into woodland below			1
but new papers have revealed the latest slip at the @entity17 sea town has been partially blamed on @entity18 's , the frozen food manufacturer , thanks to leaks from a burst pipe seeping ' oil and grease ' into the land			1
the scene at @entity7 near @entity27 where further landslides on the cliff overlooking @entity30 have led to fears more houses could be condemned			1
new papers seem to suggest food manufacturer @entity18 's could be partially responsible the coastal community has been besieged by landslides since 2008 , when the first wave led to three homes having to be bulldozed before they fell down the cliff on monday , residents woke to find that hundreds of tons of earth had again crashed down from the settlement overlooking @entity30 , @entity17 , into @entity41			1
a strip of land measuring six foot by 40ft long disappeared , bringing artist @entity45 ’s home within four foot of the cliff edge			1
the decking of his neighbour ’s home – which was already abandoned and being cleared out by a removal company yesterday – is almost overhanging the cliff edge , above a 70ft drop into the woods			2
mr @entity45 said : ' this is an environmental disaster			2
on monday there was a massive landslip at the rear of my home which has now been condemned by @entity61			2
' i have been given three weeks to knock my house down or the council will do it			2
but what really hurts is this is not a natural disaster – it ’s a man made one			2
' just weeks before the latest slip , the residents had obtained a consultant ’s report linking the instability of the cliff to leaks from a @entity78 used to discharge effluent from the @entity18 ’s oven chip and frozen food factory two miles away on the outskirts of @entity27			1
@entity18 have a potato chip manufacturing plant at @entity84 , @entity27 , and excess water based effluent is discharge from the plant via an underground pipeline that runs away from the site parallel with the coastline and eventually discharges the water into the sea			1
the southern section of the pipeline is operated by @entity18 however the pipeline becomes part of the @entity78 network to the north of the site			1
artist @entity45 outside the house he bought to use as a studio			2
he has been told the property is now dangerous and has three weeks to have the property demolished @entity105 who are engineering geologists and environmental scientists have completed a study over the last year			0
laboratory testing showed the @entity18 discharge contained a variety effluent including metals , calcium , chloride , iron , potassium , sodium , ammonia , nitrate , sulphate , fluoride , phosphate , oil and grease , according to the report			1
it states : ' the test results suggests that the water issuing from the cliff face is sourced ( or mainly sourced ) from leaks in the @entity18 / @entity78 pipeline that transports effluent from the @entity133 to the sea			1
' the elevated levels of several compounds in the @entity18 outflow and the water issues are consistent with effluent from a plant with potato waste which would be expected to contain high levels of calcium and potassium , magnesium and natural phenols in addition to sodium and starch			1
' the test results of the water issues and the effluent from @entity18 ’s factory within @entity78 pipes indicates that leakage of effluent within @entity78 pipes is the most likely source of the water issues			1
just weeks before the linked the instability of the cliff to leaks from a @entity18 's effluent pipe ' this is confirmed by the lack of water issues since the relaying of @entity78 pipework north of @entity7			1
' the slips that have occurred are considered to be due to water leaks finding flows through the sand of the @entity173 and emerging at specific points on the south and east points of @entity7			1
' the stability of the sand is reduced due to the pore water pressure created by the water which locally reduces the angle of repose causing a slip			1
' mr @entity45 , 51 , an artist acquired the property for £ 3,000 when it was written off as an insurance loss three years ago			0
the previous owner had paid £ 120,000 for it before the first landslips five years ago			0
he added : ' there seems to have been a conspiracy of silence from two massive corporations and that when the house finally goes over the cliff , its screams will be heard across the world			0
' mccains is a world famous brand with a strong ethical and environmental policy on protecting the environment			0
' i feel they have many questions to answer and indeed should act fast and responsibly , to meet the residents and to help resolve the crisis			0
' my house is now at the centre of drama , it is likely to go over the cliff and to be demolished soon			0
' however , it offers me exciting creative opportunities as an artist , for i intend to use the rubble to make sculptures and new artworks , all of which will live on as constant reminders of corporate neglect			0
' i intend to remind people worldwide through my work that these homes owned by the retired , elderly and disabled are slipping into a river of chip fat and onto the rocks of despair below the cliff			0
' residents ’ association chairman @entity230 , who lives next door but one to mr @entity45 , said : ' we ca n’t believe it ’s happening again			0
' hundreds of tons went down the cliff around ten o’clock on monday morning and we never heard a thing			0
' a neighbour came and knocked at my front door to say they had seen a tree fall over			0
we had also noticed cracks appearing			0
' residents have been negotiating for years with @entity61 to rebuild the homes on land at nearby @entity247			2
it had been hoped a big insurance payout would fund the relocation but much now depends on what the houses will be valued at			0
mr @entity230 added : ' the average age of residents around here is 70 so you can imagine the stress it is causing			0
' people are losing their homes			0
we could all be gone soon			0
there are 55 to 60 houses still here and half of them are occupied			0
' a @entity78 spokesman said : ' we have been in contact with some residents of @entity270 and we 're aware of the independent report commissioned by the @entity272 , dated december 2012			0
' due to the length and high level of technical information in the report we have not yet been able to fully consider it			2
' we will however look closely at the findings and respond to the residents as soon as possible			0
' a @entity18 ’s spokesman : ' like everyone else in @entity27 , we are well aware of the longstanding geological issues at @entity7			1
' we employ around a thousand people in the area and throughout the four decades we have been here we have always played an active and responsible role in the community			2
' as part of this commitment we have participated constructively on a voluntary basis in past authoritative studies which have concluded that inherent and unstable geological conditions at @entity7 are the most probable reason for the issue			1
' we have only received a copy of the new document from the @entity7 property owners in the last few days and , as we always take community representations seriously , we have asked geological experts to assess the document ’s contents before commenting further			1
