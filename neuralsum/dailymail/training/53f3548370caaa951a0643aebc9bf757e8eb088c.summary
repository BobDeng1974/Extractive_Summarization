by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:07 am on 25th october 2011 jailed : @entity2 was sentenced to two years and three months a married man who pretended to be a doctor faked a paternity test after his lover became pregnant so that he could deny he was the father			1
@entity7 seduced scientist and committed @entity9 in december 2007			1
he began an affair with her after claiming he was a single doctor when he met her at a conference			1
@entity2 told her that he had been educated at £ 9,000 - a - term @entity15 , followed by @entity16 , before working as a gp and then as a heart specialist			1
but after miss @entity20 became pregnant with their daughter , his account soon began to unravel			2
@entity2 refused to acknowledge fathering the child and @entity24 , 34 , was forced to contact the @entity25			2
although a dna test apparently proved his claim that he was not the father , miss @entity20 was suspicious and at her insistence enquiries by the @entity30 continued			2
the investigation found he had used his medical connections to send a dna sample from his unwitting father @entity34 , rather than himself			2
@entity37 was later proved to be the father of miss @entity20 ’s daughter , who was born in december 2009 , after which the investigation began			2
it was also revealed that he was in fact married			2
and , even more astonishingly , it was discovered that he was not a qualified doctor – despite being paid by the @entity44 to work in a clinical role for a decade , receiving a sum believed to exceed £ 500,000			1
he had been to neither @entity15 nor @entity16 , they discovered			0
in fact , the @entity49 citizen of @entity51 descent had dropped out of a medical course after little more than a year and is believed to have been schooled in @entity54 , where he was born			0
pushed for investigation : @entity9 and their daughter last night @entity2 , 53 , of @entity57 , south east @entity58 , began a 27 - month jail term after admitting three counts of fraud			0
he also said his wife @entity62 , 41 , left him because of the affair			0
the father of @entity65 , leaves @entity66 this evening miss @entity20 would have been due to receive £ 800 a month from @entity2 towards their child ’s upkeep			0
but her former lover now has no income at all , and faces having hundreds of thousands seized to repay the money he defrauded from the @entity44			0
meanwhile , his former employers face awkward questions about how he was given the jobs in the first place			0
officials insisted there was no evidence he had ever touched a patient – any instance of which would amount to assault – but @entity2 himself claimed to have worked as a gp for years			1
judge @entity89 yesterday told @entity2 , as he jailed him at @entity66 : ‘ you are an articulate , driven , and deeply dishonest man , without any apparent conscience about what you were doing			0
‘ your behaviour in respect of the paternity of your child was deeply dishonest and wilfully manipulative			0
’ prosecutor @entity98 told the court : ‘ for almost a decade , mr @entity2 held himself out as a fully qualified and appropriately registered gp with a busy @entity58 practice			0
‘ in truth mr @entity2 was not medically qualified – so obtained and kept his job as a result of fraud			0
he enrolled in 1980 as a medical student at the @entity106 – but did not graduate			0
’ instead of gaining the status of a doctor he and his family craved , the court heard that @entity2 worked in an administrative role for a company dealing with doctors			1
@entity66 @entity115 , pictured , heard how @entity2 faked the dna test by using a swab taken from his father , to avoid being found out about an extramarital affair he then switched to an office role with the @entity121 , which required no medical qualifications			1
but when a job came up in 2001 as a clinical adviser to the @entity44 trust , @entity2 falsely claimed to have the ‘ clinical expertise and qualifications ’ required to get it			1
in a cv now revealed to be a ‘ work of fiction ’ he boasted of ‘ three years ’ of experience in a busy gp practice			1
it helped secure him an important role on a ‘ coronary heart disease and stroke clinical support panel ’			1
and in 2005 he was promoted to become assistant clinical director of the @entity139 network			1
@entity2 ’s barrister @entity140 said : ‘ he simply could n’t cope with the concept that he had not managed to become a doctor			1
‘ on the paternity issue , he could not cope with the concept of his wife discovering he ’s had an affair			0
’ an @entity121 spokesman said it had ‘ learnt lessons ’ from the case .			0

@entity153 was sentenced to two years and three months
@entity115 heard his cv was a ' work of fiction '
he pretended he was another doctor with a *similar* name
worked in ' clinical *guidance* ' roles without the right qualifications
