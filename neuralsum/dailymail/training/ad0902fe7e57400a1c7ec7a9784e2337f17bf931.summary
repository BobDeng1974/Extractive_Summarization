you can never tell or prove someone is racist unless they actually say or show you			0
that ’s what i ’ve always believed			0
on tuesday in @entity9 one group of bullying @entity8 supporters screamed and shouted and showed how racist they were			1
seeing and hearing these cowards chanting ‘ we ’re racist ! we ’re racist ! ’ to one lonesome black guy made my blood boil			1
all i kept thinking was : i hope these guys get some payback			0
@entity15 played over 100 games for @entity8 in his six years at the club in the mid 1990s ' i never played in front of racist @entity8 fans ... that @entity8 was dead and buried decades ago ' @entity20 , presenter and ex footballer : ' just saw the video of the @entity8 mob 's deplorable behaviour and racist chants			1
sickening , embarrassing , moronic , disgraceful			0
' @entity26 , @entity8 's first ever black footballer : ' i watched it and i was in disgust , i was so angry and ashamed			1
we ’ve done so much campaigning against the very issue of racism and this happens and it ’s brought it all right back down			0
i do n’t care if it ’s the minority because regardless of that it is connected to the club and when you mention @entity8 this will be the response			2
i ca n’t believe this has come about			0
' @entity42 , pundit and ex footballer : ' @entity8 fans			1
save your spite for those on the train , i 'm sure you 'll want to see them banned from holding season tickets at your club			0
' @entity52 , pundit and ex footballer : ' i hope that every black @entity54 watches that			0
' @entity56 , @entity57 president : ' i also condemn the actions of a small group of @entity8 fans in @entity9			1
there is no place for racism in football			0
' @entity65 , pundit and ex footballer : ' @entity8 what you gon na do ? your club has been linked to racism for so long ! what have you done ? put a couple of signs up in your ground ? those guys on the train remind me of my childhood			2
@entity79 you with their mates ! but when alone and confronted , i 've seen them cry			0
' i was disgusted to see such behaviour			0
it was like i was going back in time and watching a documentary about the old @entity8 fans ; the old @entity8 fans that were racist , the @entity8 fans that used to give their own players racist abuse			1
it was always difficult to picture the @entity8 fans i played for being the same racist @entity8 fans who gave their own players @entity26 and @entity93 such grief and abuse			1
i never played in front of racist @entity8 fans at @entity96 or anywhere when i wore the @entity8 shirt			1
that old racist @entity8 was before my time			2
that @entity8 was dead and buried decades ago			1
the club has done all it can to kill that image and now it is very much a multicultural club			0
but maybe this is something that @entity103 ’s millions ca n’t buy			0
i kept thinking to myself : how do the minds of these racist guys work ? a few hours later these same men were cheering on their @entity8 team , with two black guys in the starting line - up - @entity110 and @entity112			2
did they cheer for them ? or did they get angry that these two were wearing the @entity8 shirt ? did these same racist idiots not cheer with the rest of the @entity8 fans when @entity119 scored that penalty in @entity121 ? was the club ’s greatest triumph tarnished because a black man scored the winning goal ? did these fans used to hate me as a black man wearing the blue of @entity8 ? only they can answer those questions			1
i ca n’t even begin to try to translate the thought process of a racist			2
a black fan attempts to board a train but is refused entry by fans travelling to the @entity138 tie the amateur footage goes on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident honestly , i find it all disgusting and hope they all get locked away			0
extreme , i know , but surely let ’s make an example of them — of racists			2
@entity8 , the @entity149 , @entity57 and any other footballing governing body need to come up with a plan to eliminate these thugs from our game and society			1
not just a poster campaign , or wristbands or even a fancy advert , but a proper campaign with proper consequences and proper punishment for those guilty			0
@entity8 need to clean up their own house with these fans and do their own in - house justice to make sure they are identified and make the punishment radical			1
@entity170 alone is not enough — there has to be a huge message for all to see			0
@entity15 ( right ) celebrates with @entity173 and @entity174 after a @entity8 goal at @entity96 @entity15 holds off @entity176 during his six - year career at @entity8 , and has been a fan ever since i know those cowards do not represent all @entity8 fans but unfortunately they did in @entity9 and brought shame on the club			1
@entity8 are my team and have been ever since i signed as a schoolboy more than 25 years ago , so i feel the highs and lows like all @entity8 supporters			1
i will defend them in debates about everything but what happened on tuesday in @entity9 was indefensible			2
i did n’t even try to			0
in many discussions i heard in the aftermath there was talk i should be ashamed to be a @entity8 fan			2
i ’m not ashamed to be a @entity8 fan and i am not ashamed over what happened in @entity9 as those racist idiots do not represent me but i am very saddened at what those mindless idiots have done to the image of my @entity8			1
@entity15 played 116 games for @entity8 between 1993 - 99 and writes a weekly column in the @entity205			2

watching those @entity8 fans in @entity9 made my blood boil
i thought we had left all this behind decades ago
@entity8 , the @entity149 and @entity57 should make an example of these racists
@entity8 need to clean up their own house with these fans
