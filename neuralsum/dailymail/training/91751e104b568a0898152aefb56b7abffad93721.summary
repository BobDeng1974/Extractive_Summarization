by @entity0 the kicking usually starts before the plane has started taxi - ing for take - off			1
a continual jabbing in the small of one 's back that jars and shakes your seat with increasing ferocity , all delivered by a pair of size 2 , @entity8 - strapped sandals on the end of some excited , feral child 's legs			1
it 's unbearably irritating and usually a sharp word to the children and a plaintive appeal to the parents yields a minute or two of peace before the whole ghastly business starts again			1
but turning around during a recent flight to the @entity29 from my home in @entity31 , to admonish the children showering me with sweet wrappers , i was shocked to find the parents nowhere to be seen			1
they 'd deliberately positioned themselves several rows behind their fractious offspring			1
occasionally , the mother lifted her head from her novel and plastic glass of @entity58 to call to her children at the front to ' behave themselves ' - which , believe me , they had no intention of doing - while their father slept soundly on			1
and i 'm afraid to say this was n't a one - off			2
as a frequent flyer ( my freelance work brings me to the @entity29 several times a month ) , and also a childless one , i 've found parents are frequently abusing the online seat booking facilities on budget airlines to position themselves as far away from their appallingly behaved children as possible , using fellow passengers as free childcare			1
it 's selfish , ill - mannered and confirms my belief that not only are @entity29 children the worst behaved in @entity79 , their parents are just as bad			1
you probably assume that because i do n't have children i ca n't possibly understand the stress of travelling with them			2
to which i 'd reply this : i 'm an adult			2
if i had them , i 'd take responsibility for them			2
i certainly would n't travel with more children than i have hands , either - how do you control them otherwise ? last week i paid Â£ 400 for my flight to the @entity94 to attend the funeral of my grandmother , who died in july , two days before her 90th birthday			2
naturally , at the height of the holiday season , the airport , close to my home in the heart of the @entity101 , was awash with middle - class parents returning to @entity29 after their holidays			1
they all looked tanned , relaxed and heartily sick to the back teeth of their spoilt , whiny offspring after a fortnight spent entertaining them			0
on reflection , the signs that the flight was n't going to go to plan were all there			0
there were children left in control of luggage trolleys , crashing into anyone who would n't move out of their way quickly enough			2
then school - aged children refusing to use the loos without their mother in the cubicle to wipe down the seat first ( yes , really )			1
then there was the endless whinnying at the check - in desk because they could n't take their bottle of @entity132 water through to the departure lounge			0
@entity0 thinks @entity29 mothers should discipline their children instead of overindulging them that day , i deliberately had n't flown with one of the bargain basement airlines that frequent this airport			1
indeed i had hoped for a calm uneventful flight in order to compose myself and polish the eulogy i was due to present the following day			0
sadly , it was n't to be			0
' @entity144 's tired and @entity145 wants to finish her book , so we 're sitting over there , ' a well - dressed , tanned woman hissed at her children after boarding the plane			1
then , she thrust a packet of sweets into each of their sweaty little hands before taking her husband 's arms and fleeing to their seats several rows behind			0
had an emergency occurred on the plane , i would have been closer to this woman 's children than she was			2
had this prospect so much as even crossed their minds ? i very much doubt it			0
needless to say , high on sugar , and even before the flight took off , the little darlings started			0
they bickered and antagonised each other before exchanging a series of kicks and punches			0
for the next 90 minutes i had to listen to their mother use me as an excuse for them to behave themselves : ' the lady will shout at you if you keep chucking your sweet wrappers at her			0
' no , this ' lady ' did n't			0
but given that the mother 's admonishments were barked out from the middle of the plane where her children could barely hear her , they ignored her for most of the flight , while i endured an hour - and - a - half of hell			1
i used to despise middle - class mothers for hoiking passengers out of their seats if they could n't sit next to their brood on crowded aircraft			0
but little could i have imagined that one day they would wise up to the fact that no one can actually stop them dumping their fractious ill - behaved children anywhere on a plane - and hang the fact that their fellow passengers might be desperate for a bit of peace and quiet			1
granted , i 'm not a parent , but i am a stepmother and my stepchildren , although now grown up , have always behaved impeccably whenever we have travelled			0
i would n't expect anything less and nor would their father , my husband @entity214			0
children slot into the family here in @entity31 - they do not take on a role akin to that of a hallowed saint			2
the sense of entitlement evident in @entity29 children , bred into them by their mothers , is staggering and it 's getting worse			1
other friends who do n't have children are gobsmacked by mothers who time and again allow their children to redefine the meaning of hooligan			0
check in and chill out : many parents are deliberately choosing to sit away from their children on flights for some ' me time ' ( posed by models ) fifty - three per cent of @entity29 adults say they would support child - free flights one girlfriend 's husband , a successful businessman who regularly travels the globe , had to hold onto one toddler 's arm for the complete journey from @entity248 to @entity249 recently because he was running riot in the aisle while his mother , seemingly oblivious to the havoc he was causing , chattered non-stop to a fellow passenger			1
my friend 's husband did n't need to speak to the child to know that the little monster was @entity29			1
he knows , as well as i , and countless other passengers like us , that such behaviour simply would n't occur within families from elsewhere in the world			0
you might argue that this is n't anything new			0
global stars and musicians have , for decades , flown first class , while their children fly in economy			0
but there is a difference : they are usually flying with a nanny or other responsible adult who supervises their behaviour and attends to their needs throughout the flight			0
today , i 'd happily pay an additional fee if i could guarantee a seat in a child - free zone of a plane			1
meanwhile , i would urge airline bosses to make a rule that children are not allowed to travel without one or other of their parents at their side .			2

as a frequent flyer , i 've seen many appalling behaved children on flights
their parents have deliberately sat aisles away
more often than not , ill - behaved children are @entity29
i 'd happily pay an additional fee for a seat in a child - free zone of a plane
