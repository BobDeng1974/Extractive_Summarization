@entity4 and @entity13 forces are not allowed to cross over into @entity6 in pursuit of militants			2

many in the army , parliament , general population and media already believed that the @entity22 and @entity4 are hostile to @entity6 and that the @entity13 @entity95 are not the enemy			1
by claiming it was the victim of unprovoked aggression , the @entity6 army is strengthening this narrative			1
a @entity6 boy joins in the protest after the helicopter attacks on friday which killed 24 soldiers and sparked widespread anger heavily guarded : the 24 @entity6 soldiers who were killed in the attacks are buried yesterday salute : @entity6 army soldiers march among the rows of coffins while the @entity22 is widely disliked in @entity6 , the army has accepted billions in @entity22 aid over the last 10 years in return for its cooperation in fighting @entity115			1

however , a complete breakdown in the relationship between the @entity22 and @entity6 is considered unlikely			0

yesterday , as funerals took place for the 24 @entity206 soldiers killed in the attack , hundreds of trucks carrying supplies to @entity202 in @entity13 clogged the @entity6 border crossings			1
as @entity6 army chief general @entity209 attended the funerals of the victims , including a major , the @entity22 sought to minimize the fallout from the crisis			1
the attack is the worst single incident of its kind since @entity6 uneasily allied itself with @entity218 in the days immediately following the september 11 attacks on @entity22 targets			0
full probe : the president and @entity224 support ' @entity4 's intention to investigate immediately ' suspected militants destroyed around 150 trucks and injured drivers and police a year ago after @entity6 closed one of its @entity13 border crossings to @entity4 supplies for about ten days in retaliation for a @entity22 helicopter attack that accidentally killed two @entity6 soldiers			1
the situation could be more dire this time because @entity6 , outraged at the alleged @entity4 attack before dawn saturday , has closed both its crossings			1

the @entity22 has long suspected @entity6 of continuing to secretly support @entity95 militant groups in a bid to secure influence in @entity13 after most @entity4 troops leave in 2014			2
