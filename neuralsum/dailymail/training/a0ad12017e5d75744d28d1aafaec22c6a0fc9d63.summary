@entity0 has vowed to defeat ' arrogant ' @entity3 leaders former cabinet minister @entity0 became @entity6 @entity5 leader yesterday – vowing to defeat ‘ arrogant ’ @entity8 leaders @entity9 and @entity10			1
talking to @entity11 , @entity0 : @entity0 , 47 , who achieved a decisive victory over union - backed rival @entity13 , succeeds @entity16 who was forced to quit after failing to stop the party ’s plummeting ratings in @entity6			1
the former secretary of state for scotland is giving up his @entity21 seat to lead a @entity5 fightback			2
if he succeeds , it could help mr @entity24 win next year ’s general election			0
but the men are not @entity5 allies			0
@entity28 led the unsuccessful @entity5 leadership campaign of @entity24 in 2010 and was bitter at being sidelined by @entity30			2
@entity0 sidestepped questions about his relations with @entity30			2
instead he poured scorn on @entity9 ’s decision to try to win a @entity36 seat after resigning following his defeat in the referendum			2
pointing out it will be @entity9 ’s third return to @entity21 , @entity0 said : ‘ for someone who , allegedly , wants @entity6 to free itself from the @entity36 , @entity9 going back there for a third time suggests he does n’t dislike it as much as he pretends			1
’ and he took another swipe at @entity9 for standing in the @entity21 constituency of @entity47 , @entity48 , where he is already a member of the @entity50 , instead of @entity51			1
‘ @entity9 has n’t had the courage to stand in @entity6 ’s biggest city			1
instead he decided to stand in @entity48			0
he has a right to do that , but it would have been more confident if he ’d stood in @entity51			0
‘ for @entity9 , all the problems of the world are solved by the simple slogan of independence			2
most scots know the world is more complicated than that			0
a lot of good people who voted @entity65 in @entity51 are scunnered			0
’ it means ‘ fed up or p * * * * d off , ’ he explains			0
‘ they are scunnered they ’ve got @entity71 as @entity72			2
’ @entity0 feels his own sense of frustration that , despite the result of the referendum – and his brave personal campaign , during which he was pelted with eggs and even branded a paedophile by demonstrators – @entity9 and @entity10 have stepped up demands for more power from @entity21 , and possibly another referendum			1
mr @entity0 criticised @entity9 and his decision to stand as an mp again , adding that he does not have ' the courage ' to stand in @entity6 's biggest city			1
the new @entity5 leader in @entity6 said many who voted @entity65 in the september referendum were left ' fed up ' with @entity71 as their prime minister mr @entity0 blamed @entity5 for the rise of the @entity3 who , they said , were able to ' capture the symbols and emotions of patriotism like the @entity98 's flag ' ‘ @entity5 has been magnanimous in victory in the referendum , the @entity3 has been victorious in defeat			1
there ’s a sense of arrogance about the @entity3			0
the public like confident politicians , but they do n’t like arrogant ones			0
’ @entity5 has itself to blame for the rise of the @entity3 , argues @entity0			1
‘ just as @entity6 was becoming more confident and outgoing , the @entity108 allowed the @entity3 to capture all the symbols and emotions of patriotism like the @entity98 ’s flag			1
‘ i want to turn it into a contest between patriotism and nationalism – they are different			0
@entity118 is pride in your country , people and history			0
’ how did he respond to @entity125 ’s claim that victory for @entity0 would be a ‘ political death sentence for @entity5 ’ in @entity6 ? ‘ @entity128 does n’t have a vote in @entity6 , he does n’t live in @entity6 so i shrug my shoulders			1
i ’m not a fan of that kind of politics			0

said many @entity6 are ' scunnered ' to have @entity71 as prime minister

@entity144 ‘ *lacked* courage , was simplistic ’ and **accused** @entity10 of ‘ ignoring ’ @entity6 who voted to stay part of the @entity147 .

**accused** unite union boss @entity125 , who tried to stop him becoming leader , of ‘ *insulting* ’ @entity5 supporters .
