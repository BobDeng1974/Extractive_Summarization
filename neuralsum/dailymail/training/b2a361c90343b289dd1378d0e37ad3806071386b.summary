@entity1 defender @entity0 believes @entity2 lack the ' strong , battling players ' of @entity5 title rivals @entity4 and @entity6 - and is glad they did not sign powerhouse midfielder @entity7 when they had the chance			1
the @entity10 were within minutes of inflicting defeat on the misfiring @entity12 at the @entity14 on saturday , before @entity15 forward @entity16 netted a stoppage - time equaliser to secure a 2 - 2 draw			2
@entity2 manager @entity19 accepted his side had failed to match @entity1 's aerial superiority , which was shown when @entity22 headed the visitors into a 2 - 1 lead right at the start of the second half			1
@entity1 defender @entity0 ( right ) tries to shut down @entity2 striker @entity16 at the @entity14 there was also little @entity2 were able to do to stop @entity28 into the penalty area to quickly cancel out @entity31 's opening goal , although the hosts claimed @entity33 had been pulled back in the build - up , which @entity1 boss @entity35 dismissed as ' an individual piece of grappling '			1
@entity7 joined @entity1 from @entity39 on transfer deadline day , the @entity38 midfielder having long been linked with a switch to @entity2			1
@entity0 is glad the move worked out in @entity1 's favour			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity7 ( right ) was outstanding against the @entity12 ' @entity44 has been brilliant			1
his quality , his composure , he has definitely added to our squad			0
i was expecting a hustle - and - bustle midfielder , a strong , get - about player			2
i thought the goals would come but to get four in five is ridiculous , ' said @entity0			0
' @entity2 were meant to get him on about two or three occasions			0
he nearly went there when he was at @entity55 and when he was at @entity39			0
' i am not sure if it was something to do with the medicals , so i do n't know why it did n't happen - but i am delighted it did n't and that he came to us instead			0
' @entity35 's men looked on course to claim a 2 - 1 victory before @entity16 's stoppage - time equaliser @entity0 believes @entity2 do lack something , but remain one of the most technically gifted squads in the @entity5 , which was highlighted in the 13th minute on saturday by @entity31 's excellent finish after cutting inside from the right			2
' when you compare them to @entity4 and ( man ) @entity6 , those two have got the quality as well as big , strong , aggressive , athletic players			2
when you look at @entity2 , i guess they have got the footballers , but you ca n't really see the strong , battling players , ' he said			1
' but with the football they play they do n't really need that because if you have got the possession more often than not , you do n't need to chase the ball and have big , battling midfielders			0
that is how @entity2 have always done it			0
' they got to this level with @entity19 playing this football and why should they change it now ? '			0

@entity2 lack ' strong , battling players ' of title rivals like @entity4 and @entity6 , says @entity1 defender @entity0
@entity0 is pleased @entity1 signed midfielder @entity7
@entity19 admits the @entity12 failed to match @entity1 's aerial superiority
