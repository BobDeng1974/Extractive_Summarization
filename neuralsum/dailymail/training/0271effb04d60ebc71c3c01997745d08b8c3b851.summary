you have to wonder whether @entity1 ever crossed @entity3 's mind when he signed for @entity4 on monday			1
like @entity1 before him , @entity5 - one of the hottest prospects outside the @entity7 - has taken the decision to continue his footballing development at @entity11			1
@entity12 will hope , however , that 's where the similarities will end			2
@entity4 signed 18 - year - old @entity3 on transfer deadline day before loaning him back to @entity17 the 18 - year - old has impressed for @entity17 this season and attracted interest from a number of top clubs @entity12 was recently named @entity24 player of the month while @entity25 won manager of the month spurs were convinced they 'd signed the future @entity28 captain when they plucked @entity1 from @entity30 in a hugely controversial move back in 2008			1
as we know , it did n't turn out that way ; @entity1 made four substitute appearances for @entity4 in five years			1
his failure to make the grade remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern - day @entity41 football			2
fast - forward seven years and @entity5 , when he joins @entity4 next season , will be hoping for a much different outcome			2
he 'll be joined by young central - defender @entity45 , who is well - placed to discuss the obstacles facing @entity12 when he arrives in the summer			1
the @entity47 under - 21 international has been at @entity11 since he was 15 - arriving from @entity50 club @entity49			2
the @entity17 youngster has scored 12 goals in 32 appearances for the @entity24 side so far this season after signing from @entity30 back in 2008 , @entity1 endured a frustrating spell at @entity4 having made three senior appearances for the club , @entity45 spent a spell at @entity59 before joining @entity60 on loan until the end of the season			1
@entity45 will head back to @entity11 in the summer intent on , like @entity12 , proving his worth to @entity65			1
and the 19 - year - old says the arrival of the @entity69 manager means youngsters like @entity12 and himself will now be given a fair crack of the whip			2
' the manager has shown he is ready to give young players a chance , ' @entity45 told @entity77			0
' and there is @entity79 ( academy manager ) , and @entity81 ( head of recruitment and analysis ) as well , they are looking for the youth			0
' there are now more training sessions with first team for the under - 21s and the first team coaches are having a look at the @entity92 more often now ; it was n't like this in the past so its getting better			0
' however , @entity12 should n't expect to walk straight into @entity65 's first - team plans next season			1
having played regularly in @entity4 's pre-season tour of the @entity99 last year , @entity45 found first - team opportunities hard to come by when the season started - prompting his loan moves to @entity59 and @entity60			1
' i do n't know too much about @entity12 , but i think it 'll be the same for him as me , ' said @entity45			1
' maybe he will play for the @entity105 's , and then train with the first team and if he 's good enough he could make the bench			0
@entity108 hopes to impress @entity65 in pre-season , just like @entity5 will be hoping to do so the 19 - year - old ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity114 's @entity113 in the @entity116 third round the @entity47 under 21 defender puts in a challenge on @entity120 's @entity119 in october 2014 ' it 'll be step - by - step			0
maybe he could go on loan , which was the right step for me			0
' the manager said to me in the summer that he wanted me to go to @entity99 with them , so i went and played quite a bit			0
' but when the season started , in my position there is quite a few players			0
i gave 100 percent but it was difficult			0
' i did n't really get an opportunity , so i spoke with the gaffer and he told me i needed more experience so that 's why i went on loan			0
' but the manager will give you a chance , so my plan is to play as much as i can at @entity60 and then go back to @entity4 for pre-season and impress the manager			2
' you wo n't be the only one , @entity146 .			0

@entity3 joined @entity4 from @entity17 for *Â£* *5million* on deadline day
the move strikes similarities with when then *highly* - rated *teenager* @entity1 made the move to @entity11 back in 2008
however , things did n't go to plan for @entity1 at @entity4 - making just four substitute appearances in five years
@entity12 will want to make sure he does n't suffer similar fate at the club
fellow @entity4 youngster @entity45 says @entity12 will get an opportunity to force a way into the first team when the time is right
