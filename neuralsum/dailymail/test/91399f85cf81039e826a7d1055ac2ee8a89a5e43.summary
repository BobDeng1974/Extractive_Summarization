nearly 500 @entity1 holidaymakers were stranded overnight on an impounded cruise ship in @entity4 harbour after its owners were served with a summons for an allegedly unpaid debt			1
the passengers coming towards the end of a 15 night cruise became the unwitting pawns in a legal wrangle between a former crew member and the owners of the @entity15			1
the ship had been set to leave @entity4 at 7pm on tuesday night with its 489 passengers heading back to @entity18 after a round - trip tour that took in @entity20 in @entity21 , the @entity22 , and @entity23			1
but that was scuppered when lawyers slapped a court order on the ship over an ' unresolved ' and ' historic ' financial wrangle			1
the harbour master then refused to let the ship leave for @entity18			1
but the legal dispute was between owners @entity42 - from which they were chartering the vessel - and one of that company 's former staff			0
the @entity1 cruise firm , which had nothing to do with the financial wrangle , eventually came to an arrangement with @entity54 authorities which allowed the ship to sail - 19 hours late - at 2pm wednesday			1
it said passengers were kept informed throughout , helped with onward travel arrangements affected by the delay , and given access to a complimentary bar			2
one stricken passenger sent a text to a relative telling him : ' ca n't believe we 're stuck in @entity4 , @entity65			2
' our ship has been impounded due to an historical incident which basically means an unpaid debt			0
' the @entity23 - registered 16,144 - tonne , 525ft - long @entity15 was built in 1946			2
it has eight passenger decks and room for 550 passengers in its 227 cabins			0
prices for the cruise range from £ 779 per person for a standard twin inner - cabin , to £ 4,159 per person for the owner 's suite with an ocean view			0
the average price for the majority of cabins is priced at £ 1,500 per person			0
@entity39 's commercial director @entity87 said : ' the delay of the @entity15 overnight in @entity4 related to a historic local issue with the vessel 's owning company , @entity94 from whom @entity39 charter the ship using our own crew			1
wrangle : the legal dispute was between owners @entity42 - from which they were chartering the vessel ( file photo ) - and one of that company 's former staff going nowhere : the harbour master then refused to let the ship leave the port and passengers eventually arrived back in the @entity1 19 hours late ' this dispute involved a previous crewing issue going back to 2014 and was settled first thing this morning			1
' but we had to wait for the clearance documentation to be signed off by the local authorities			0
the ship is now heading en - route back to the @entity1			1
' he added : ' on behalf of @entity39 , i would like to extend our sincere apologises for the delay and any disruption caused			0
' @entity87 said his company , set up in 2010 , carries more than 100,000 ocean and river cruise passengers a year and had ' never experienced a delay of this nature before '			0
luxurious : the average price for the majority of cabins on the @entity15 is priced at £ 1,500 per person the firm 's online brochure says of the @entity15 : ' with her handsome profile and a traditional walk around promenade deck , the 16,144grt @entity65 registered @entity22 is a classic beautifully restored ocean going cruise ship carrying just 550 guests and offers a wide selection of very well appointed and comfortable public lounges and cabin accommodation spanning eight passenger decks serviced by two lifts			2
