a @entity1 man who 's finally no longer required to pay child support after 13 years of bank - breaking wage garnishment still owes the state $ 21,000 in back payments			1
and the girl is n't even his			0
@entity8 says he suffered for years as he struggled to make monthly payments and now that it 's been proven he ca n't possibly be father to the girl , who he 's also never even met , he may still be forced to pay up			1
expensive mistake : @entity8 of @entity14 , @entity1 has had his wages garnished for some 13 years because he was erroneously included on a girl 's birth certificate according to @entity1 state law , he 's required to pay any outstanding payments owed , as well as any accrued interest			1
all this , despite dna tests proving unequivocally @entity8 is not the father and all because he was initially named on the birth certificate by the mother			1
' i 've never seen the child			0
i never spoke to the child			0
i do n't know what the child looks like , ' @entity8 told @entity31			2
nonetheless , because of his garnished paychecks , he says : ' there were days that i did n't eat			0
' @entity8 has a court appearance on monday , one he hopes will save him from losing all his hard earned cash to what amounts to a clerical error			2
' i 'm hoping for it but the judge has the last say so , ' he said			0
in @entity1 , the answer is : when the man is finished paying			0
the termination of the man â€™s parental rights ends the obligation to pay future support , as of the date the order is rendered			2
however , the order does not eliminate any child support obligations before that date or any interest that has accrued			1
the man is still responsible for arrears that accrued up to the termination date , as well as for interest that accrues after the termination date			1
source : @entity1 attorney general law not on his side : ' i 'm hoping for it but the judge has the last say so , ' @entity8 said as he discussed whether he 'll be off the hook for his outstanding balance the state of @entity1 voted to allow @entity71 proof to reverse parental rights , whereas it had previously been next to impossible			2
however , the law was written to work forward , not backward			0
and there are no refunds			0
so , the woes of people like @entity8 who 've already had trouble paying child support will continue as they struggle to keep up with mounting interest on back payments			1
and @entity8 is far from alone			0
another @entity1 man , @entity82 , reached out to @entity83 in 2011 to discuss the very same predicament			0
the @entity1 man owed even more than @entity8 , though			2
he owed back child support amounting to $ 50,000 , $ 13,000 of which was interest			1
i don t understand the judge can just give you a baby that ai n't yours , @entity82 said at the time			0
you are not the father : @entity8 and his ex are both totally positive he is n't the 13 - year - old girl 's father , but the law in this situation does not look backward -- what 's done is done and @entity8 's debts , at least for now , must still be fulfilled the girl 's mother has written to authorities to say @entity8 should not be forced to pay support and they agreed			1
however , state law requires he pay the back payments plus accrued interest			1

@entity8 of @entity14 , @entity1 has had his wages garnished for some 13 years because he was erroneously included on a girl 's birth certificate
the girl 's mother has now written to authorities and now @entity8 's @entity120 is no longer frozen and he no longer must pay child support
however , @entity1 law requires @entity8 must still pay his $ 21,000 *unpaid* support and any interest accrued after the termination date
