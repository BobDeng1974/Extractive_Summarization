grieving @entity9 said ministers were ' hurting a lot of families ' by disbanding the @entity13 ( @entity14 ) to save money			1
defence secretary @entity16 has ignored critics to press ahead with axing some of the @entity19 's most distinguished battalions to reduce personnel from 102,000 to 82,000 - its lowest strength in more than 250 years			1
yet campaigners claim the @entity14 is one of the best recruited regiments in the @entity25 , while some battalions that have been saved are hugely under - strength			1
mr @entity1 spoke out as hundreds of veterans attended a protest march in @entity30 on tuesday against the scrapping of a historic battalion			0
his 25 - year - old son , a married father of a little boy , survived bombs and bullets in @entity37 with his regiment only to be hacked to death in a terror attack in broad daylight outside @entity42 , south - east @entity4 , in may			1
two men have denied his murder			0
urging the government to rethink the decision , mr @entity1 said : ' they [ @entity14 ] are like a clan of brothers , and that family has closed around us			2
they 've taken us into their family , and that 's what the @entity54 is all about			0
' take away the heart of a regiment , it takes away the history , and it hurts a lot of families			2
once a @entity54 , always a @entity54			0
' wearing distinctive red - and - white plumes in their berets , the former fusiliers marched to the sound of a fife and drum band as they delivered a petition opposing the cuts to @entity70			0
the 2nd battalion of the @entity13 has five companies with 600 personnel			1
it is an infantry battalion of the regiment which has served in conflicts since 1674			2
@entity78 chairman colonel @entity77 - who heckled the defence secretary as a ' disgrace ' during his @entity82 conference speech last month - led the parade			1
he said : ' it makes absolutely no sense for @entity14 to be disbanded			1
protest : former members of the @entity13 march from @entity70 after handing in a petition to save the battalion earlier this week marching on @entity89 : the @entity13 will be cut as part of government plans to replace 20,000 regular forces with 30,000 reservists brothers : colleagues acted as pall bearers carrying the coffin of father - of - one @entity1 earlier this year , mr @entity1 this week described how his family had been supported by his son 's former regiment in the aftermath of his murder grieving : @entity104 and @entity9 pictured at their son 's funeral at @entity108 in @entity109 in july ' the government has spoken about efficiencies and cost savings , but there is no explanation for this unfathomable decision			1
' this has been a striking demonstration of poor management and leadership on the government 's part , to say nothing of the betrayal of the hundreds of men who have served in the battalion			1
' @entity54 groups from key recruiting grounds of @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 joined the march			0
@entity82 mp @entity131 , a former @entity54 , said : ' the axing of @entity14 proves the government 's mishandling of these army reforms			1
' it makes no sense to save less well - recruited - and therefore more expensive - battalions			1
' it is yet more evidence that @entity134 plans to replace 20,000 regulars with 30,000 reservists are on the rocks			0
' replacing regular troops with reservists will be expensive and lead to unacceptable manpower and capability gaps , but the government seems determined to plough on blindly			2
' the @entity6 said the cuts were planned to make the @entity19 more ' adaptable to future challenges '			0
a spokesman said : ' we have been clear that the regular @entity19 is becoming smaller and over a year ago we also announced changes to its structure so it is more reflective of the complex global situation			0
' to suggest decisions were taken on recruitment performance alone is a fundamental misunderstanding of the @entity19 's process			0
' * @entity160 , 28 , and @entity161 , 22 , have pleaded not guilty to murdering @entity1			0
the pair also deny separate counts of attempting to murder police officers who arrived at the scene in @entity3 .			0

the @entity13 are being disbanded as part of government money saving *measures*
but critics claims axing the regiment , which is one of the best recruited in the @entity25 , makes no sense and that others should be cut instead
defence secretary @entity16 has ignored criticism in his bid to reduce army personnel from 102,000 to 82,000
