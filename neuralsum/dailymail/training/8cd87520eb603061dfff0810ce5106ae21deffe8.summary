@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has shrugged off criticism aimed at him and insists he does not dwell on individual performances whether they are good or bad			1
the @entity5 international came under even more scrutiny after an error in the midweek @entity10 tie but responded with only his third clean sheet in 25 appearances in the scrappy 1 - 0 win over @entity14			1
former @entity1 goalkeeper @entity15 this week blamed him for the club 's poor start to the campaign , criticising his inability to deal with crosses or command his area , but it has not even registered with @entity0			1
@entity0 has come under heavy criticism this season for some high - profile mistakes @entity27 's late goal against @entity14 ensured @entity1 took three points at the weekend ' i deal with a good performance the same as a poor performance - you have to accept it and move on , ' he said after @entity1 ended a three - match losing run in the league			1
' what i did after the ( @entity39 ) game was look forward to the next game and that is what i will do again today			1
' it is always pleasing as a goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet but the most important thing is to get back to winning ways and hopefully we can build a bit of momentum now			1
' if you play at home you want to win games and we did the job and that is all that counts			2
' there is another game on tuesday ( against bottom side @entity59 ) and we will look forward to that one			2
' @entity27 looked groggy as he was attended to by the @entity1 medical staff after his goal @entity62 was dropped on the 16th anniversary of his debut , but he came on as substitute former @entity1 goalkeeper @entity15 blamed the @entity67 ' poor start on @entity0 after an instantly forgettable first half which saw @entity1 lack any semblance of cutting edge or even an idea of how they were to break down @entity14 they improved after the break			1
however , @entity74 , standing in for the rested @entity62 as captain , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 all had decent chances to score , but it was only after the visitors had hit the post through @entity83 and @entity0 had produced a brilliant close - range block to deny @entity85 that the winner came - from the most unlikely of sources			1
@entity74 swung in a cross for @entity77 to head over goalkeeper @entity89 and back off the crossbar and right - back @entity27 was quickest to react with a low diving header to bundle the ball over the line with five minutes remaining			0
@entity1 survived a nervous seven minutes of stoppage time to record only their third clean sheet of the season in a defence which saw one change from the midweek @entity10 draw with @entity100 in at left - back , allowing @entity27 to switch to his preferred right with @entity102 the one to miss out			1
that meant a first league start since february 12 for @entity106 , who had impressed at centre - back in the last two @entity109 matches			2
' he has got the experience			0
he has played throughout the years and he knows what he is capable of doing , ' @entity0 said of the 33 - year - old @entity112			2
' he can help the team and organise them so we know what to expect from him and he works his socks off every day in training and is always ready when the gaffer needs him			0
' despite playing behind another changed back four @entity0 said it made no difference to him			2
' we are professional football players so we have to deal with that , ' he added			0
' you train with all the lads in training every single day so you know what they can do and you know what their capabilities are			0
' @entity0 ( centre ) was all smiles as @entity1 left the @entity135 pitch on sunday @entity14 manager @entity136 felt his side deserved a point with summer signing @entity83 impressing			1
' i thought the outstanding player was @entity83			0
he was unfortunate to hit the post and had an outstanding volley at the end , ' said the @entity146 boss			0
' everyone saw the quality he has			0
he is getting stronger in every game			0
' he is enjoying the @entity150 , enjoying playing for us			0
we need to give him the ball more often because he has the ability to produce			0

@entity0 came under scrutiny in the week after an error gifted @entity39 a goal in the @entity10
he kept a clean sheet for @entity1 on *saturday* , his third in 25 games
@entity15 has blamed him for @entity1 's poor start to the season
@entity0 though , has shrugged off the criticism aimed at him
