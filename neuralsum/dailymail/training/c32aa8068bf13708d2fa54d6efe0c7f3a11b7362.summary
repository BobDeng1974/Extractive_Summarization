' if @entity0 ca n't sell it , i do n't know who can ' said the 66 - year - old designer			2
' i think @entity0 's a great representative of @entity7			1
she 's full of life , she 's about what everyone wants to feel - energy			2
and i find her ageless			0
she 's like this @entity59 who can wear anything from track shoes to stilettos , @entity7 to @entity11			1
i love the girl as a person , too			0

leading online beauty retailer @entity112 of @entity114 who stock the fragrance says that he is not surprised to see such an augmentation in sales			0
' there has been an unprecedented rise in sales of @entity7 fragrance in the past couple of months			1
this can only be put down to the huge appeal and publicity surrounding the new fragrance with @entity0			2
' there has been a huge sales uplift of 249 % year on year against the same period last year on nearly all of their fragrance lines that we stock but the sales figures for the @entity5 fragrance are nothing short of spectacular and it 's looking set to be one of the top selling perfumes of 2015			1
' from the @entity139 to reality tv star @entity140 , it seems that most public figures have them			0
but earlier this year celebrity scents suffered somewhat of a slump with beauty giant @entity145 seeing a 28 per cent revenue drop because of a decline in their sales			1
furthermore , the company said the drop in sales , which triggered a 25 per cent fall in share price , was largely due to the fragrances of pop stars @entity155 and @entity156			2
the cosmetic firm said its quarterly pre-tax loss to the end of june was £ 48m – the worst in the company ’s 104 year history			0
each year , more than 500 celebrity perfumes are released into an already highly saturated market , which began with the launch of @entity166 ’s @entity165 for @entity145 in 1991 and went on to sell 60million bottles			0
sales were at the highest in 2011 , when @entity155 ’s someday was the biggest selling perfume in @entity23 – with one bottle sold every minute in the first week of its launch			0
@entity145 , which had to cut 175 jobs because of the slump , said at the time that half the loss was due to such products , adding in a statement : ‘ the decline in sales of celebrity fragrances , particularly the @entity155 and @entity156 fragrances , was steeper than anticipated			0
’ however just a few months after this dramatic drop in sales was reported the celebrity perfume industry saw a helpful boost with the launch of @entity189 star , @entity191 ’s fragrance @entity192			0
record numbers of the @entity194 flew off the shelves , also placing it in the top three biggest selling scents across all ranges after its launch in june			0
@entity191 's newcomer overtook @entity203 's @entity202 , which fell into second place , while @entity207 's that moment and @entity208 took third and fourth respectively			0
meanwhile the @entity210 spokesperson @entity209 contradicted the news of dropping sales and said that the company had seen a dramatic increase in sales			2
' 2014 is proving to be a hot year for celebrity fragrances			0
we 're seeing a surge in sales as customers want something new from their fashion and music icons			0
