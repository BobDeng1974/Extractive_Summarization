it 's a gadget that sounds like it is straight out of a @entity2 movie - an iphone that fires lasers			2
but @entity5 is developing a new laser - based system for future generations of its @entity3 devices			1
rather than cutting through handcuffs and walls like devices designed for 007 , however , @entity5 is planning to use the feature to enable its phones to map their surroundings			2
@entity5 's patent suggests the lasers could be mounted behind existing openings like the camera ( label 20 ) or have its own dedicated opening ( 12 ) in the side of the phone that would then be pointed at walls or objects the laser would be mounted inside the @entity3 and used together with the inbuilt motion sensors to generate a map of any surface it is pointed at			1
an @entity3 - mounted sensor would detect any light bounced back to the device and provide information about the surfaces of objects around it			2
this would allow the @entity3 to be used to measure distance and create 3d maps of rooms and even buildings - something that currently requires bulky equipment			1
@entity5 's patent proposes using motion detection hardware in the @entity3 to allow users to freely move the laser along a wall to measure distances from one point to another or to build up a detailed map of the surroundings according to @entity5 's patent , the laser mapping may work in the following way : 1			1
user will start laser mapping application 2			2
they then choose a measurement mode - either surface mapping , volume mapping , planar surface mapping or curved surface mapping 3			0
@entity63 , @entity64 , cellular data and motion detector establish coordinates of @entity3 position			2
laser is turned on and gathers data as it is moved across the surface			2
user can input additional data using the laser as required until a map can be generated 6			0
app generates image of map created on display			0
this can be stored or transmitted to other devices			0
a flowchart from the patent showing how @entity5 envisages its @entity3 laser device may work designs for the @entity3 laser were revealed in a @entity88 patent application submitted by @entity5			1
it raises the prospect of being able to connect future generations of the @entity3 to 3d printers so users can replicate their favourite objects or important components			1
@entity5 claims the laser technology could be incorporated into other handheld devices such as @entity98 , laptops and even wearable technology like its new @entity101			1
writing in the patent , @entity5 said : ' conventional laser measuring devices measure only the distance from the device to a given surface			1
' these devices are unable to measure distances between multiple points that are separate from the device and therefore require the user to place the device is specific locations for which measurements are desired			0
' this can be difficult in , for example , a furnished room with items that restrict access to all parts of the room			0
' additionally , these devices can be bulky pieces of equipment that require batteries or battery packs and must be purchased and transported separately from other equipment and electronic devices			0
' it would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved electronic devices with mapping circuitry			0
' @entity5 proposes housing the laser and sensor inside an @entity3 , giving it a dedicated opening in the case to allow the laser beam to be emitted and received			1
however , it says the laser system could also be mounted behind the camera , the display or even inside the port for headphone jacks			0
the laser system works by measuring the time it takes for the light to be reflected back to the sensor mounted in the @entity3 , allowing it to measure the distance from an object			2

iphone users may be able to build up maps of their surroundings simply by pointing their phone at them the @entity3 laser will be able to map surroundings by precisely measuring the distance to nearby walls the laser mapping could be used in a handheld device thanks to the @entity3 's existing positioning hardware the laser system works by measuring the time it takes for the light to be reflected back to the sensor mounted in the @entity3 , allowing it to measure the distance from an object			1
it can also build up a picture of the texture of the surface it is pointed at by looking at the amount of light that is scattered			0
similar systems have been used to produce 3d maps of buildings such as the @entity185 in @entity186 while paleontologists have adapted the technology to produce maps of dinosaur tracks			1
however , these devices need to be mounted in a single spot for hours on end to build up a detailed image			0
@entity5 proposes allowing its users to do the same with handheld phones by using the laser in combination with its gps and data from the @entity3 's motion sensors			1
it said : ' for example , a user may stand in a room and aim a laser beam generated by the laser sensor at a wall			0
' the user may gather laser sample data while pointing the laser at first , second , and third points on the wall			0
the user can freely move the device between sample points			0
@entity5 's proposed laser technology could see some popular public areas like musuems looking more like night clubs as @entity3 owners attempt to scan everything in sight with the sophisticated mapping system ' as the user moves the device , the positioning circuitry monitors the position and orientation of the device			1
' when the user gathers laser sample data at the second and third sample points , the positioning circuitry can determine the relative position and orientation of the device with respect to the position and orientation of the device during the first sample point measurement or with respect to a global coordinate system established at the outset of mapping operations			0
' while such technology will be useful for professionals like architects , builders and even estate agents , it could find wider uses among the general public			0
it would be possible to provide instant dimensions of an object to online buyers , for example			0
householders could use it to map their room and work out where new items of furniture may fit			0
the technology could also help @entity5 to build up more detailed street level views for its map application by uploading scans performed by users			1
@entity5 's patent says the laser mapping could appear in iphones and wearable technology like the @entity5 watch the system could also be used in combination with 3d printing to allow users to produce replicas of a favourite toy or an important piece of equipment			1
however , such technology may result in museums and other public venues having to ban eager @entity5 fans from scanning everything in sight			2
according to website @entity5 , the full potential of the laser technology will become clear as the company submits more patents for its devices			1
it said : ' more than likely @entity5 will expand upon this invention in the future so as to provide us with more insight as to how consumers will be able to take advantage of this new laser beam system for @entity294 that cover everything from an @entity3 , @entity98 and @entity5 watch			1
' while @entity5 is careful to not mention the word @entity299 , the nature of the measurements would suggest that the data collected in three axis mode would create a 3d model			1
' it 's definitely one of @entity5 's most interesting inventions of the year			2

built in lasers would create 3d maps of rooms , furniture and objects
@entity314 hopes that future @entity3 will be able to connect with 3d printers

@entity5 says technology could appear in @entity3 , @entity98 and its new watch
