sommeliers were not impressed with the taste of the grey ship wreck wine			2
@entity74 of @entity75 , @entity73 is shown looking at the murky liquid it could have been a @entity79 fortified wine , a spirit , or medicine , but after 151 years at the bottom of the ocean , it 's now mostly saltwater , they said			2
wine chemist @entity85 of the @entity86 , had previously analysed samples drawn through the cork			0
he said the ‘ nose ’ of the wine was a room - clearing mix of camphor – which is used in vapour rubs to treat colds - stagnant water , hydrocarbons , turpentine and sulphur			1

the boat was leaving @entity37 with supplies for the @entity110 states when it struck a reef and sank in six minutes , said @entity112 , a cultural anthropologist and custodian of historic shipwrecks for the @entity37 government			0

leaving @entity37 with supplies for the @entity110 states , the boat struck a reef and sank in six minutes			0
during the @entity9 , president @entity156 imposed a naval blockade of the @entity10 coast from @entity159 to @entity160 in a bid to stop exports of southern cotton , turpentine and tobacco to @entity166 - crippling it financially			1
subsequent dives turned up the additional bottles , as well as sealed bottles of perfume , women 's shoes , hairbrushes and pearl shell buttons			0
the bottle containing the grey ' wine ' is shown the southern response to the blockade was the blockade runner - fast steamships that were manned by daredevil crews who could come under fire and faced possible imprisonment			2
the boats were highly profitable and saw the goods they carried selling for 200 to 700 per cent more than they had in peacetime , @entity186 reported			0
@entity55 was one of them and was commissioned by two brothers in @entity159 to serve their business interests in @entity196 and its colonies , including @entity37			2
in its short lifetime , the ship is believed to have been chased by a @entity201 blockader but escaped , leading the crew to throw 100 bales of cotton , worth $ 100,000 overboard to lighten the load			0

with the crew scrambling for lifeboats , the ship sank rapidly			0
sinking after just two years of service rumours were rife that the pilot had deliberately wrecked the ship , but there is no evidence to suggest that he was working for the @entity10 consul in @entity37			2
much of the cargo was retrieved , but items like wine bottles , shoes , perfume bottles and other personal effects were left behind and were revealed after @entity234 in 2009 .			0
