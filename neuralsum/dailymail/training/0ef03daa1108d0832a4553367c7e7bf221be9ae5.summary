by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 07:44 est , 27 february 2013 when a deer and her fawn were trapped on the thin ice of a frozen harbour in @entity7 , rescue workers decided it was too risky to go out and help the stricken animal			1
the mother was exhausted after hauling itself out of the freezing water of @entity13 in @entity14 after repeatedly crashing through the ice and could not even stand up on the treacherous surface			1
not wanting to leave the deer and its offspring to their fate , a skilled helicopter pilot hit on an ingenious solution - blow the deer to shore using the downdraft from his helicopter 's rotors			1
' it caught my eye that the female was down on the ice and every time she tried to get up , she would fall back down and she was splayed out , ' he told @entity49			1
a few hours later , @entity37 spotted a @entity41 helicopter near the mother and the alarmed fawn ran to shore as the chopper descended			2
he was amazed by what happened next			0
airborne : a @entity57 helicopter hovers near the deer and frightens off the fawn skilled : the pilot manouevres to the side of the animal and tilts the rotors air rescue : the deer slides on the ice , propelled by the downdraft of the chopper ' the wash , because the ice was so smooth , the wash was so powerful that it actually started to push the deer , ' says @entity37 , who recorded the incredible rescue on camera			1
at first the terrified animal struggled , but as it realised it was moving towards safety it stopped struggling and allowed itself to be blown along			2
once it hit dry land , a @entity41 officer and the pilot helped it to its feet and sent it on its way			1
@entity37 later saw the deer and her fawn reunited in the woods			0
he said : ' it was just brilliant			2
it was a solution exactly tailored to the situation			2
' the action was captured by retired biologist @entity37 , who often photographs wildlife in the region when the deer reaches the shore it is pulled to safety by waiting @entity57 officers			0
the animal was later reunited with her fawn a department official said it ’s not always practical to help wild animals in distress , but that they will assist on a case - by - case basis if it ’s appropriate and safe			0
@entity108 runs a store in nearby @entity110 and says her brother was one of the officers who helped the deer			0
she has been showing the video to customers			0
' everybody i ’ve shown it is more than impressed with it and was quite amazed at the situation and the wonderful outcome that happened with the deer , ' she said .			0
