etiquette expert @entity0 claims politicians should not brag about their conquests yet another example of ‘ over-sharing ’ has come to our attention			1
this time from the new @entity7 , shadow chancellor @entity8			1
speaking to @entity11 , the @entity10 politician responded to a new survey that has found him to be one of the supposed best lovers in parliament ; he explained that he was a ‘ long , slow lover ’ in bed			1
as to why the @entity16 thought anyone would like to know these intimate details as to what he does with his … well … balls is the operative question			1
he may be @entity22 incarnate once the ( always rather generous ) suit comes off but as one of our elected representatives just , as voters , we do n’t want to know			1
yet over-sharing our conquests now seems to be the done thing and whereas once a gentleman would never have kissed and told , now you are a nobody if you do n’t broadcast the news on radio stations , or , on a more domestic level , on social media or loudly to a your friend in a coffee shop , with who knows how many people unwittingly privy to the details of the cut and thrust			1
i wrote a few weeks ago about chivalry being on life support due to ‘ wimmin ’ but it is also due to the continuing lapses in common sense and decency of men that too has contributed to the long , slow murder of chivalry			1
the survey as to who would be the best lover in the @entity57 was issued by everyone ’s favourite parenting website @entity60 ( who clearly still have too much time on their hands if they are wasting time and money commissioning pointless surveys like this and forgetting to get on with actually raising their children )			1
it ’s not just dim politicos that have failed to get over the need to brag about their conquests			2
we were ( rightly ) aghast when in 2011 one of that year ’s @entity79 wannabes @entity77 flashed his flabby bottom on our screens with each of his @entity84 notches tattooed across his posterior ; the only thing worse than the ink itself was the smug sense of accomplishment on the hopeful ’s face			2
@entity8 , pictured left , and right with wife and @entity10 mp @entity94 confessed to being a ' love , slow lover ' during an interview about a @entity60 survey on @entity11 an intimate act is exactly that – something that happens in our private life , although clearly these lives are now not as private as they should be			1
i put this over-sharing about our sex lives in the same bracket as public displays of affection : any affection , whether a kiss on the lips , a cuddle or more , is something special to be shared with the two people involved			1
showing it off to others , physically or verbally , devalues it , cheapens the act and the people involved			2
at least with a pda the ‘ showing off ’ is consensual , whereas the over-sharing of what goes once in the bedroom is more often not			2
how does @entity94 feel about her mr @entity123 discussing this in such a public fashion ? i doubt it will lead to further ‘ long , slow ’ sessions in the coming weeks			1
but , politicians have been trying pathetically to be our friends since the 1997 election campaign			2
no longer can then just be satisfied with getting on with running the country but they must pander to their own insecurities and be ‘ liked ’ as well			2
do they think we care ? maybe the now deputy prime minister @entity135 only got to where he is today by announcing in 2008 that he has slept with around 30 women ? one surge in his polls too many causing his electability to blossom , perhaps			0
former premier @entity141 won the bad sex award for a particularly churning description of sex with @entity145 – i will not reprint it here			0
again , why he felt the need to let us all know what the couple were like behind the closed black shiny door is a good question			0
power attracts , we know that , but real power does n’t need to reveal cheap details in attempts to get our own juices flowing			0
that said , we should have seen this revelation coming : how many days until the election from today ? 69 … when to ‘ put out ’ anyone worth entering into a loving and fruitful relationship with wo n’t ‘ put out ’ ( awful phrase ) on the first date , and not really the second			0
the norm now is that something may happen on the third date , although this is largely the accepted standard in @entity172 that thanks to the @entity175 generation has been adopted worldwide			0
we @entity176 used to keep our legs crossed and swords sheathed a bit longer than the third date			0
keep your mouth shut telling one or two close and trusted friends how your date went is understandable but chose your time and place			0
the coffee shop may be a good venue to catch up on news but the nice elderly couple to your left , who had been enjoying their extra wet @entity193 , need not know of your extra hot exploits			0
you can refuse to answer do n’t feel pressured into talking about something that is going to make you feel uncomfortable			0
if a friend asks you , perhaps misjudging the moment , then you are perfectly at liberty to not answer , or instead deploy a cunning euphemism that may satisfy their thirst for gossip but spare you from being tempted to go into details			0
that awkward moment when … think about it – it ’s been six months since you made it official with your former date and now boy / girlfriend			0
you ’re both at a dinner party hosted by your friend who , after one or two many helpings of a @entity214 , lets slip some intimate detail that they had forgotten you had told them seven months ago whilst you were using sex chat as a means to bond with them … how do you think your special one will feel ? wanted ? loved ? like she ’s bagged a real gent ? think again … @entity0 is author of @entity222 .			1

@entity0 says voters do *n't* want to know about @entity226 ' love lives
believes it is contributing to ' long , slow murder of chivalry '
intimate acts should be kept private and not ' over-shared '
