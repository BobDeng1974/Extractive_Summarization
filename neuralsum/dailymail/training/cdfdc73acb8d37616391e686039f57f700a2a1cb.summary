with every new bit of transfer speculation about a @entity3 player i ’ve been trying to stay positive			1
‘ at least no club demands such consistently high transfer fees for their players , ’ i ’ve been telling myself			1
‘ lots of good players remain			2
’ but with first @entity11 ’s departure to manage @entity12 , and then @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 gone , now @entity16 and @entity17 almost out the door , and possibly @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 to follow ( like most @entity3 fans i ’m ignoring the impact of @entity24 leaving ) - my patience and confidence is sapping			1
six players went to the @entity49			0
it was a season that left @entity3 fans full of optimism			1
now we ’ve gone back ten paces			0
in the @entity55 where small margins separate mid-table teams from relegated ones - that could be critical			0
everyone ’s looking for someone to blame			0
is it the all those involved in the departure of @entity64 - the chief executive who left halfway through last season ? certainly many things seem to have stemmed from that moment			2
or @entity11 ’s for bailing as soon as he got an offer from a more fashionable club ? i ca n’t blame the players for being ambitious - least of all @entity14 for wanting to finish his career at his hometown club			1
and no matter how resilient the board , they ca n’t keep hold of players who no longer want to be there			0
but you can hold the board responsible for failing to inspire the squad with confidence			0
if there had been a clear plan and signs of ambition - as in the past five years - then surely many would have stayed			0
man at the helm : @entity11 left @entity88 's this summer to take charge of league rivals @entity12 floored : new @entity3 striker @entity90 looks on during the @entity3 ' friendly win over @entity92 this is a board that promised transparency and open - ness , so where is the message to fans that behind the scenes the club is signing players ? we could have a £ 100 million plus war chest , what is being done with that ? new manager @entity33 has so far signed two players , but how good will they be ? ask most @entity3 fans i know , what they do when we sign a player and the answer is : “ look on @entity111 to find out who they are ”			1
the club has a good recent history of signing players - that is , at least , another reason for hope - but it takes time to build a squad			2
the flying start of last season is a distant memory already			0
at this rate , the first league game against @entity37 in three week ’s time is going to come far too quickly .			1

@entity129 and @entity88 's *regular* @entity130 *asesses* the *situation* at @entity3
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 have already left the club
@entity17 has moved to @entity37 and @entity16 is on the verge of a switch to @entity31
