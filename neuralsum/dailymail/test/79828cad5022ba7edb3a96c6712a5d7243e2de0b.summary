@entity0 returned to @entity1 for the first time since he left @entity3 and masterminded a victory which pulled his @entity6 side to the edge of safety			1
@entity9 tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit @entity12 but an early goal from @entity14 and stunner from @entity16 meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left @entity3 two days before this season kicked off			1
despite the timing of his departure , however , there was very little bad blood between @entity3 ’s fans and @entity0 who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving			1
a few boos broke the surface , but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season , during his 10 - month tenure , when he won the @entity40 lma manager of the year award			2

‘ they did well for me last year and i hope i repaid them a little bit in respect to what we did in the dressing room and on the pitch			0
‘ it is a good club			0
it has got unbelievable potential and i mean that			0
the supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager			0
they can push on – if @entity9 is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club			0
’ @entity64 even made the effort to go over and shake @entity12 ’ hand as he strolled down the touchline			0
yet the south @entity121 locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when @entity6 took the lead			1
@entity124 swung in a corner from the left and @entity14 managed to lose @entity3 midfielder @entity61 and nod in , completely free , from five yards out			1
some of @entity61 ’s team - mates looked around in disbelief that the @entity6 man was afforded so much space in the box			1
‘ that was a weakness in our set up that @entity0 exploited , ’ @entity9 admitted			2
‘ it was well worked			0
their guy took @entity61 to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking			0
‘ we knew @entity0 would know the players well , know the strengths and weaknesses , i tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch			2
they did n’t come off			0

people know @entity0 does an honest job , he plays the game his way and we respect that			2
’ despite that early set back , however , @entity3 started to play the eye - catching football that has made @entity9 so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge			0
and it was all coming through their main man , @entity64 , on the left			0
in the 24th minute he weaved into the box , played a one - two then poked an effort towards the near post which @entity6 goalkeeper @entity71 did well to save with his feet			2
three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that @entity71 clawed out			0
then , just after the half - hour , a ball came in from the opposite flank from @entity52 , was headed on by @entity63 and @entity64 executed a sublime bicycle kick , only to be denied by @entity71 once again			2
if @entity0 , dressed in his usual full tracksuit , trainers and cap on the touchline , provided this @entity3 team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight , @entity9 , resplendent in suit and tie , has given them the suave and flair to delight			0
in this instance , @entity0 ’ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes			2
the ball came out from a @entity6 corner and @entity16 took a touch before , 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal , he buried a right - foot strike over @entity51 into the left of goal			1
it is almost mission accomplished for @entity0 at @entity6 as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three			1
