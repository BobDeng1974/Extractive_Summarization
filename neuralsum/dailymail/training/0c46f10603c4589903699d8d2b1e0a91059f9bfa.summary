an @entity1 couple are on the cusp of being granted access to a breakthrough medical trial which could potentially save the life of one of their two young children			1
but it 's a bittersweet and anxious moment awaiting @entity10 and her husband @entity11 , whom require both their three - year - old boy @entity12 and five - year - old daughter @entity14 to participate in the life - saving trial that only 15 children , worldwide , will be invited take part in			1
in an interview with @entity21 's 60 minutes program on sunday , the @entity11 's have told reporter @entity22 of their son and daughter 's fight against @entity27 and the incredibly rare misfortune of having conceived two children with the disease that affects just one in 70,000			1
' we had the perfect family , well you know we thought we did and all of a sudden they ( doctors ) tell you there 's something wrong , it 's a pretty hard thing to take , ' father @entity11 said upon hearing their second child , @entity12 , was diagnosed just a month after @entity14 was struck down with the disease			2
' it 's like we won some sort of reverse lottery or something , ' mrs @entity59 said			0
unknowingly , the pair were both carriers of the mutated gene which they passed onto their two children			0
@entity27 causes developmental delay in children , usually younger than five , who have an inability to break down complex material in cells as part of the metabolism process			1
with nowhere to go , the material turns toxic and from the moment the child is born it builds up in the central nervous system			0
and because it is classed as ' ultra rare , ' very few doctors know about it and even less pharmaceutical companies - zero - are willing to fund trials in children which have proven effective on mice			2
@entity59 , 5 , was diagnosed with the severe condition , just a month before her three - year - old brother @entity12 @entity12 provided hope for @entity91 and mrs @entity59 in fighting their daughter 's disease , until he too was unfortunately struck down with the very same disease the @entity11 's are hoping that their two children are invited to participate in the drug trial , which begins in @entity98 in december but all that is about to change , courtesy of a band of parents including the @entity11 's and an @entity104 family that have raised more than $ 1 million to begin trials in in young patients			1
the only problem is just 15 children will be granted access , meaning the @entity11 's fear that they will be restricted to having one child at best participate in the trial			1
' fifteen places worldwide , we are realistic that it is unlikely that we would get two of those places , ' mrs @entity59 said			0
' there are lots of parents all around the world just like us with the same hope			0
' through incredible fundraising means such as online crowd sourcing , and the work of the @entity11 's @entity129 set - up to raise crucial awareness about the condition , the trial will begin in december			2
it 's participants , as yet , are not known			0
head of biochemical genetics at @entity140 's @entity136 professor @entity135 has dedicated 40 years of research to @entity27 , having developed a gene replacement therapy that was successful on mice			2
@entity141 , left , is overseeing the trial of just 15 patients in the @entity104 and is following on the breakthrough work of researcher @entity135 , right , who has discovered a drug against @entity27 mrs @entity59 is hoping her son @entity12 and daughter @entity14 will be included in the trial , saying it would be a ' miracle ' if they are both on it ' if you start early in a mouse , then you can prevent the condition from developing , ' mr @entity135 said			1
he is hoping , that when the trials go ahead in the @entity104 later this year , it can even reverse the condition and bring children back to normal health			1
' that 's the big question ' he said , ' but the earlier you start the better chance you 've got of slowing or reversing the condition in a very significant way			0
' the gene replacement therapy works by injecting a virus that delivers a healthy gene into the brain			0
if it works , as it did in mice , that a single injection will stop the disorder in its tracks and the children would become the first survivors of @entity27			1
dr @entity141 who is overseeing the trials in @entity98 must decide which 15 children in the world will get the most benefit from the drug trial			1
he said without the fundraising efforts of people like the @entity11 's , there would be no chance of it going ahead			0
' these parents have played a key role from fundraisers in the back yard or at school bake sales and have really paved the way for the progress that we 've made			0
' mrs @entity59 said ' it would be a miracle ' if her children were selected for the trial			2
' i 'm hoping that we will come back here ( @entity104 ) , hoping that other @entity1 children will have the opportunity to come back here and i 'm hoping work we are doing as a foundation will enable that			2
' it feels so real now ... it 's the only chance that we have , and we are chasing that with everything we have			0

parents risk choosing one of two children to go on new drug trial
only 15 patients will go on trial to reverse @entity27 **syndrome** *symptoms*
parents have *joined* forces with @entity104 family to raise $ 1 million to fund it
*sanfilippo* **syndrome** leads to developmental delay , declining mental state and death in young children
