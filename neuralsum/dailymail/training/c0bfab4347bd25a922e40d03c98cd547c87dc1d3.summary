smartphones today react to touch , shakes and even our voices , but phones of the future could respond to these motions with touches of their own			0
a @entity8 researcher from @entity9 is working to develop screens that create a variety of different responsive sensations			1
examples include a clicking sensation when pressing an on - screen button , and sensing the weight of folders as they ’re dragged across a display			1
the examples include a clicking sensation when pressing an on - screen button , and sensing the weight of folders as they ’re dragged across a display some of the sensations are based on stimulating the skin , while others stimulate muscles , and recent research also found such sensations can help people type faster			1
prototype tablet devices , including those developed by @entity8 and @entity38 , use ultrasound vibrations to mimic a variety of textures			1
these vibrations change the friction between the finger and the screen to trick the brain into thinking it ’s plucking a harp , touching the skin of an alligator , and more			0
it can also give the sensation of a slippery liquid			0
other , similar technologies change the friction between the finger and the screen using static electricity			0
@entity56 developed a similar system in october that uses an algorithm for @entity60 touchscreens that modifies the friction between a user 's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at			1
@entity38 claims its technology can reproduce edges , ridges , protrusions and bumps as well as other sensations using its technology			2
‘ the way we design computers today , ’ @entity8 researcher @entity78 said , ‘ it would seem that people only use their eyes			1
’ ‘ sure , we tap on our device screens , slide our fingertips across the glass , and type on on - screen keyboards			2
‘ sometimes , we give voice commands and listen back			0
' our phones vibrate when a text arrives , and we feel a rumble from a joystick when we play a video game			0
‘ but still , it ’s almost entirely about the eyes			0
’ @entity8 researcher @entity78 believes users ‘ have barely begun to engage our other senses , particularly touch ’ , and she has been working to develop hardware and software to add tactile sensations smartphones and tablets - known as haptic feedback			1
‘ with sight alone , most people are perfectly fine interacting with computing devices today , but how much more efficiently , how much more enjoyably , can we interact with computers ? ' how much more accessible can we make them ? we wo n’t know until this becomes taken for granted			0
’ @entity78 previously worked with researchers from @entity106 to develop haptic keyboards			2
some of the sensations being developed are based on stimulating the skin , while others stimulate muscles			1
recent research also found such sensations can help people type faster			1
researchers suggest mimicking the feeling of keys improves the positioning of the fingers and makes typing feel more natural in the case of vibration feedback , for example , it involves electronic engineering and mechanics , as well as knowledge about human sensitivity to create various vibration frequencies			0
in the case of haptic keyboards , the key - click feedback actually simulates the feeling of pressing a key			2
one method being researched includes putting a layer of material under the glass that bends under electric voltage , which , in turn , bends the glass ever so slightly to simulate a key click			0
@entity78 ’s @entity143 group has developed a number of prototypes that produce haptic keyboard feedback			2
in a recent research paper , @entity78 and @entity147 , a graduate student at @entity106 , revealed that haptic keyboards can boost typing speed and accuracy			1
@entity38 unveiled a prototype tablet at this year ’s @entity153 that uses similar technology			1
it uses ultrasound vibrations to mimic a variety of textures			0
these vibrations change the friction between the finger and the screen to trick the brain into thinking it ’s touching the skin of an alligator ( pictured ) and more @entity56 developed a similar system in october that uses an algorithm for @entity60 touchscreens that modifies the friction between a user 's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at ( pictured ) more research needs to be done into why this occurs , but @entity78 suggests that by mimicking keys it improves the positioning of the fingers and makes typing feel more natural			1
@entity78 ’s group is also working on haptic tablets that simulate sticky and smooth sensations			2
@entity38 unveiled a prototype tablet at this year ’s @entity153 that uses similar technology			1
the @entity188 firm 's prototype uses ultrasound vibrations to mimic a variety of textures			0
these vibrations change the friction between the finger and the screen to trick the brain into thinking it ’s plucking a harp , touching the skin of an alligator and more			0
@entity56 developed a similarsystem in october that uses an algorithm for @entity60 touchscreens that modifies the friction between a user 's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at			2
however , the technology is still in its infancy and there are no immediate plans to release devices with these features .			0

@entity8 researcher @entity78 is an *expert* in haptic feedback
she is developing touchscreens that create different , responsive sensations
examples include a clicking sensation when pressing an on - screen button , and sensing the weight of folders as they ’re dragged across a display
some are based on stimulating the skin , while others stimulate muscles
recent research also found the sensations can help people type faster
@entity38 has developed a prototype tablet that works in a similar way
