by @entity0 @entity1 has taken a bite of @entity4 cool with its own state - backed smartphone - which appears to be a rip off of the @entity8			2
sold in three colours , the so - called ' @entity9 ' appears to be a clear copy of the ageing @entity4 gadget - except with a few localised alterations			2
basically , do n't expect a flood of @entity16 photos of young clubbers partying in @entity18 , since the pariah state 's strict censorship laws mean phones marketed in the country ca n't call overseas and have no internet			1
the ' @entity9 ' : the must have accessory for every hip young @entity1 worker nevertheless , the number of mobile phone users in @entity1 has been steadily increasing since the communist dictatorship 's first 3g network was introduced in 2008 , @entity26 reports			1
by may last year , it was estimated that two million @entity1 now carry mobiles - which , as leaks by the @entity36 @entity35 whistleblower @entity34 have revealed , are effective tools for surveillance			1
no details of the devices ' technical specifications have been published , but pictures published by pro-north @entity1 @entity44 outlet @entity42 suggest it is running a modified version of @entity49 's @entity48 operating system			0
the genuine article : the @entity8 seems to be the inspiration behind the @entity9 , which observers say is a remodelled @entity54 product it is unclear whether the phones - available in in pink , navy blue and white - are actually being made in @entity1			1
state - run media announced last august that the country had begun making a smartphone called the ' @entity62 ' using home - grown technology			0
but photographs of the country 's portly young leader , @entity65 , visiting the factory apparently making the phones raised suspicions that the mobiles were merely @entity54 imports rebranded for the @entity1 market			1
mobile tech website @entity72 reported last week published a photographs comparing the @entity62 phone with the @entity54 - made @entity76 that appeared to confirm that suspicion			2
' both devices are 97 per cent similar except the brand , the network support and the operating system , ' a reporter for @entity72 wrote			0
' the logo of @entity76 was replaced by the @entity62 logo in the @entity1 language while the network support as well as the os must be modified based on the regulations in @entity1 before official release			0
' despite apparently having managed to build its own nuclear weapons , isolated @entity1 lags well behind its @entity92 neighbours in technology			0
crash landings of suspected @entity1 drones in @entity96 in recent weeks have revealed they are little more than remote - controlled toy aeroplanes equipped with consumer - grade cameras available for just a few hundred pounds .			0

@entity1 mobile phones ca n't call overseas and have no internet
the country is estimated to have about two million mobile phone users
