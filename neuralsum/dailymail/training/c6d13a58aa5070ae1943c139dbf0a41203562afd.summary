refuge : @entity0 today hinted that @entity1 would grant political asylum to whistleblower @entity3 who leaked the @entity6 government 's monitoring of phone records and the web one @entity0 report stressed that the country has a consulate in @entity19 where @entity3 could make an asylum request			1
the @entity0 angle contrasts with its total refusal to act on @entity33 hints that it could help solve the @entity36 crisis by granting asylum to its long - time ally president @entity39 and his family			1
@entity3 , 29 , is a technology expert working for a private firm subcontracted to the @entity43			2
refusal : the @entity0 angle contrasts with its total refusal to act on @entity33 hints that it could help solve the @entity36 crisis by granting asylum to president @entity39 last week he told the @entity48 newspaper of a mammoth surveillance operation run by the @entity43 on telephone and @entity52 records around the world			2
in the @entity6 he has been branded a traitor and there is pressure for his extradition from @entity19			1
however , he has triggered a debate in many countries on whether state snooping goes too far			0
@entity0 mp @entity61 urged the @entity62 to look at a the possibility of granting political asylum to @entity3			1
' it would be a good idea , ' he said			0
@entity1 is due to see @entity6 president @entity67 at the @entity68 in @entity69 next week			2
@entity3 has said he wants to seek asylum in @entity71			1
@entity71 's interior minister , @entity72 , has the final say on whether the whistleblower would receive asylum in the country but a spokesman for her denied to @entity48 that the ministry had received any requests from mr @entity3			1
' at the moment we have received no inquiry or application from mr @entity3 , and we can not therefore speculate on whether any such application would be granted , ' @entity79 said			2
the country of 320,000 people has served as the home base for the fundraising efforts of anti-secrecy website @entity89 and earlier earned a reputation as a safe haven by taking in @entity6 fugitive former chess champion @entity93 in 2005			2
mr @entity3 's case already echoes that of @entity89 founder @entity95 who took refuge in @entity98 's embassy in @entity99 last summer after @entity101 authorities issued an international warrant for his arrest amid allegations of sexual assault			2
he has been hiding there ever since			0
@entity71 's government of newly - elected conservative prime minister @entity108 , may not be so generous this time around			2
while still untested , it is widely seen as closer to @entity110 than past administrations and less keen to foster the island country 's cyber-haven image			0
but @entity71 lawmaker @entity114 and @entity116 executive director @entity115 released a statement on sunday vowing to do all they could to help protect mr @entity3 , if he was able to make it to the shores of the tiny @entity122 country			1
' whereas @entity116 is based in @entity71 , and has worked on protections of privacy , furtherance of government transparency , and the protection of whistleblowers , we feel it is our duty to offer to assist and advise mr. @entity3 to the greatest of our ability , ' their statement reads , according to @entity135			1
checked out : today an employee at the 5 * @entity137 in the neighborhood of @entity139 , said a guest by the name of @entity3 had checked out of the hotel this morning caution : @entity3 also revealed that he covered his head with a blanket when he communicates to muffle his voice holed up : speaking from his hotel room , @entity3 admitted he had only left his room three times since he arrived on may 20 the pair added that they were already working on detailing the legal protocols required to apply for asylum and said they were seeking a meeting with the newly appointed interior minister mrs @entity72 as soon as possible to discuss whether an application for asylum , if made , can be processed as a priority			1
in the @entity48 interview , mr @entity3 suggested @entity71 was his number one option			1
he said his ' predisposition is to seek asylum in a country with shared values , the nation that most encompasses this is @entity71			1
they stood up for people over internet freedom			0
' @entity115 told @entity48 that they have been following the story ' with morbid fascination ' and mr @entity3 's mention of @entity71 was their ' cue to take action			1
' ' we are working on the basis that if he were to arrive in @entity71 we would have a plan in place and ready to go , ' he said			2
mr @entity3 needs to make his way to @entity71 soil or show up at one of its embassies in order to claim asylum			1
but if he managed that , he would have the @entity71 people 's support , @entity115 said			0
the government would have to weigh up enraging its major trading partner in its decision to claim or reject asylum to mr @entity3			1
' however , it would be rather embarrassing for the @entity6 if it cut ties with this small nation because it had complied with its human rights duties , ' @entity115 said			0
he would be free to live in @entity71 while immigration authorities decide his case , which could take more than a year , according to @entity197 , a lawyer specializing in asylum cases			2
@entity71 has an extradition treaty with the @entity6 , but it is unclear whether it would cover any crimes that @entity3 might be charged with			1
meanwhile , @entity98 is another possible ally			0
the country 's embassy in @entity99 is currently harboring @entity89 founder @entity95			0
@entity3 's whereabouts were not immediately known on tuesday , although he was believed to be staying somewhere in the @entity207 autonomous region that has a well - established , @entity33 - style legal system inherited from its status as a former @entity211 colony			0
empty and on the market : @entity3 's former home in @entity214 , @entity215 , which he fled last month for @entity19 so he could leak details about the @entity6 government 's secret surveillance programs secrets : a neighbour said today that the garage at the home had boxes stacked floor to ceiling when @entity3 was planning his escape @entity3 checked out of @entity19 's @entity137 on monday and has not been seen in public in the territory			1
no charges have been brought and no warrant has been issued for the arrest of @entity3			0
he arrived in @entity19 on may 20 and as a @entity6 citizen is legally permitted to remain for 90 days			1
he can also apply for asylum through the @entity234 or attempt to fly to another country which , unlike @entity19 , does not have an extradition agreement with the @entity6			1
even if an extradition request is brought by the @entity6 , @entity3 could contest it on grounds of political persecution in a process that could drag on for years			1
in addition , @entity19 's high court in a ruling on a case concerning three @entity245 asylum - seekers ordered authorities to devise a unified standard for assessing asylum applications			2
the ruling effectively puts applications on hold until the new system is in place			0
@entity254 , a spokeswoman for the @entity255 , refused to say monday whether the @entity6 had made an extradition request or might do so in the future			2
' necessary ' : the top intelligence official , @entity258 , said the @entity43 's intelligence measures , carried out at sites like this one in @entity261 , were ' used to keep @entity6 safe ' under the terms of its handover from @entity211 to @entity207 rule in 1997 , @entity19 maintained its independent legal system , a boisterous media , and strong civil society that would likely object boisterously to any attempt to railroad @entity3 through the legal system			1
and though a semi-autonomous part of @entity207 , it ultimately answers to @entity271 , which is often at odds with @entity110			0
@entity273 said he was n't clear about exactly how @entity3 made the decision to come to @entity19 , but said simply evading the @entity6 authorities was n't the only factor he considered			1
' it 's very difficult for me to assess that choice because it was a very personal mix of factors that he took into account when deciding where he wanted to go , so if his only goal had been how can i best evade arrest , there probably would have been other better places for him to go , ' said @entity287			0
@entity273 said @entity48 plans to publish further stories based on information provided by @entity3			0
row : a security guard stands outside the @entity6 consulate in @entity19 today , where inside officials will be trying to extradite @entity3 back to the @entity6 the @entity6 and @entity19 routinely cooperate on requests to transfer criminals ; in one high - profile case , @entity19 extradited three @entity297 suspects to the @entity6 in 2003			1
the @entity6 is also one of the largest investors in @entity19 , a major business center for @entity301 , and at least one local politician said she thought it best if @entity3 simply left			1
' maybe he does n't know we signed so many treaties			0
the two parties have agreed to all of them			0
so he 'd better leave @entity19 , ' said @entity307 , a member of @entity19 's legislative council and former secretary for security , was quoted as telling the @entity311 newspaper			0
while @entity271 at times stands up to @entity110 , it may not want to for @entity3			0
@entity271 has often criticized foreign governments for harboring critics of its communist government			0
@entity207 also is seeking @entity6 cooperation on retrieving corrupt @entity207 officials who have fled to @entity6 , often with sizeable assets			2
@entity319 and cyberespionage have emerged as the newest friction in relations that presidents @entity67 and @entity324 pledged over the weekend to improve			0
still , the extradition agreement gives @entity19 ways to say no. the @entity6 and @entity19 concluded the treaty with @entity271 's blessing on the eve of the territory 's hand back from @entity211 to @entity207 in 1997			1
provisions allow one side to refuse a request if it 's deemed to be politically motivated or if the suspect is unlikely to receive a fair trial			0
@entity271 may also have a veto			0
the agreement allows @entity271 to refuse to extradite a @entity207 national for reasons of national security			0
a study by the @entity6 @entity343 in 1997 suggests @entity271 may have wider discretion to prohibit any extradition , not just of @entity207 nationals , on national security grounds .			0

@entity3 , a former @entity17 technical assistant fled to @entity19
leaked details of @entity351 , which he says *harvests* personal data from web
@entity6 government allegedly targeting @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 and others
@entity3 said he wants to seek asylum in @entity71 but has not made contact
