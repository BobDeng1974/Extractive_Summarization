by @entity0 published : 18:45 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 19:51 est , 7 april 2013 @entity3 support for membership of the @entity5 is now ‘ wafer - thin ’ , @entity1 has warned ahead of talks with @entity9 leaders			1
the prime minister will travel to @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 this week to demand the @entity5 stop meddling and pay more attention to ‘ democratic consent ’			1
mr @entity1 affirmed his commitment to reform and said he was ‘ convinced ’ that there would be changes to @entity9 ’s rulebook			1
clawing back powers : @entity1 is heading to @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 this week to discuss the @entity5 before his visit to @entity24 today , the prime minister said : ‘ we need to recognise that consent for @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity5 , and all the ways that it has changed , has become wafer - thin in @entity3			1
‘ and politicians , if they do their job properly , have to recognise this fact rather than try to brush it under the carpet			2
’ the prime minister also accused the institution of ‘ over-reaching itself ’ with directives and interferences			1
he is determined to claw back powers from @entity9 over certain areas such as human rights and law and order			2
mr @entity1 , who will speak at a joint press conference with @entity24 ’s prime minister @entity47 in @entity11 , said he wants to challenge the central tenet of the @entity5 , namely the commitment in the founding @entity50 in 1957 to create ‘ ever closer union ’			1
he said @entity9 would be stronger if it was more flexible , ‘ where we do n’t all have to do the same things in the same way at the same time ’			0
in remarks to newspapers in @entity58 , @entity24 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i think the best outcome for @entity3 is our membership of a reformed @entity5			1
’ burning issue : a protester in @entity66 sets fire to an @entity5 flag in 2011 as @entity3 support for @entity9 has collapsed @entity3 governments and political parties had reneged on promises to hold a referendum on the @entity5 , he said , saying that this has ‘ damaged consent for @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity5 ’			1
he added : ‘ there ’s no good wishing that away			0
it exists ; it ’s a fact			0
and the best thing to do when you have a problem is to confront that problem , deal with it			0
’ warning that treaty change was inevitable , he continued : ‘ i ’m absolutely convinced that there will be the need to reopen at some stage these treaties , not least to solve the problem of the @entity89			0
‘ just as @entity89 countries will argue that it ’s necessary to have treaty change , i think it ’s perfectly legitimate to argue that @entity95 countries might need to have treaty changes			0
’ mr @entity1 hit back at critics accusing him of creating uncertainty in the @entity5 with his threat to hold a vote on @entity3 ’s membership if the institution did not reform			1
he said : ‘ the greatest uncertainty would be to have this problem and to wish it did n’t exist			0
‘ much better to have a plan for how we make changes to the @entity5 , how we make changes to @entity3 ’s membership , how we secure @entity3 ’s membership of a reformed @entity5 and we settle this issue			2
’ he cited the financial transaction tax as one @entity5 move that @entity3 opposed , adding : ‘ we are a major @entity9 power , a major @entity9 player			2
but do we think that the @entity5 has sometimes overreached itself with directives and interventions and interferences ? yes , it has			2
and that needs to change			0
’ after his first official trip to @entity11 as prime minister , mr @entity1 will travel to @entity12 for talks with @entity58 president @entity123			1
he will meet @entity60 chancellor @entity124 in @entity13 at the end of the week to discuss his reform agenda			0
but both @entity60 and @entity58 have warned there is little chance they will agree to overhaul the treaty to reflect his demands before 2017 – when he pledged to hold an ‘ in / out ’ referendum			0
mr @entity1 has been urged to bring forward the poll to 2015 to prove he is serious about changing @entity3 ’s relationship with @entity9			2
more than 100 backbench @entity136 mps have said he has not gone far enough and want a timetable and details of the referendum now .			0

prime minister will demand @entity5 pay more attention to ' democratic consent '
@entity1 accused the institution of ' over-reaching itself ' with its *lawmaking*
