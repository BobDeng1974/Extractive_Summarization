by @entity0 a @entity2 academic is encouraging his students to pick their noses in a bid to see if the habit has any health benefits			1
professor @entity8 is requesting his pupils to investigate the possible health benefits of eating their mucous in a bid to understand the human immune system better			1
he believes that eating mucous in the nose may boost the immune system by introducing small and harmless amounts of germs back into the body			1
his theory follows others that suggest improved hygiene has led to an increase in allergies and auto - immune disorders			2
getting stuck in : parents discourage their children from picking their nose but it could be good for their health , claims one expert his proposed study involves splitting his class into two			0
half will eat their pickings whilst other will not engage in the antisocial behaviour			0
they will then observe how the immune system responds to the new habit			1
professor @entity8 said : ‘ all you would need is a group of volunteers			2
you would put some sort of molecule in all their noses , and for half of the group they would go about their normal business and for the other half of the group , they would pick their nose and eat it			0
' ‘ then you could look for immune responses against that molecule and if they 're higher in the booger - eaters , then that would validate the idea			0
’ professor @entity8 added that the greatest value of the snot - eating question is that , when he brings it up with his first - year science students they are instantly engaged in the class			1
‘ get the student to think , rather than just sitting there taking down notes , ’ @entity8 said			2
‘ [ @entity68 ] should be about the exchange of ideas			0
’ but the associate professor of biochemistry at the @entity73 is a firm believer in the powers of picking your nose			0
he said : ‘ nature pushes us to do different things because it is to our advantage to have certain behaviours , to consume different types of foods			0
other bad habits such as nail biting may also help boost the immune system ' so maybe when you have an urge like this to pick your nose and eat it , you should just go with nature			1
’ ' from an evolutionary perspective , we evolved under very dirty conditions and maybe this desire to keep our environment and our behaviours sterile is n't actually working to our advantage , ' he told @entity99			0
experts such as dr @entity101 , consultant immunologist from the @entity103 ’s @entity102 , believe a similar thing occurs when we bite our nails			0
‘ unless your hands are filthy , the bugs we encounter when biting our nails could boost our immune system , ' she said			1
the immune system works by developing a ' memory ' and making a note of how to fight each bug it has ever encountered			1
when a bug is encountered a second time , the immune system reaches into its ' memory ' and releases weapons — called memory lymphocytes — that know how to kill it .			2
