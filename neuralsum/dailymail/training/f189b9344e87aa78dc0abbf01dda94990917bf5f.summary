it may have been hailed as one of the greatest achievements in human history , but that has n't stopped internet pranksters poking fun at the @entity8 comet landing			0
within hours of the @entity11 probe landing on the surface of comet @entity13 , social media users were busy mocking the @entity15 's achievement			1
using images from @entity20 film @entity18 , the @entity22 movies , and tv series @entity24 , internet users made light of the historic moment			2
what 's the fuss about : @entity30 users pointed out that while @entity11 may have landed on a comet two days ago , @entity20 landed on an asteroid way back in 1998 in the film @entity18 slam dunk : one internet prankster noticed and uncanny resemblance between the @entity11 probe as it detached from @entity8 , and this famous silhouette of @entity38 we have a problem : this joker imagined the @entity8 probe encountering the rock - eating space worm found living on a comet in original @entity22 trilogy one @entity30 user also noticed an uncanny resemblance between a picture of the @entity11 probe disappearing into space and the famous silhouette of @entity38 going for a slam dunk			1
@entity30 also saw the birth of the hashtag ' we can land on a comet but we ca n't ... ' mocking the comparatively simple milestones humanity has yet to pass			1
included on the list was the ability to ' make @entity59 to play after we lock our smartphone screen ' , ' order a @entity63 's breakfast after 10.30am ' , and ' convince the check - out there 's nothing unexpected in the bagging area '			0
dropped a clanger : these early images of @entity11 landing on seem to suggest the @entity24 was less a children 's tv show , and more of a factual documentary spot the difference : one internet user points out the similarity between @entity11 and a cement mixer you broke it : the craft carrying the @entity11 probe is pictured orbiting that picture of @entity82 and in line with her mission to ' break the internet ' over the last few days , one image showed the @entity8 craft orbiting around @entity82 's posterior			1
scenes of wild celebration inside the @entity15 headquarters also provided web users with a source of amusement , with one fist - pumping scientist attracting a lot of attention			0
dr @entity101 's eye - catching arm tattoos and odd dress sense also attracted a lot of attention online , though not all of it was positive , with some criticising his shirt as offensive to women			0
this scientist also got a lot of chuckles out of people on @entity30 after the landing achievement : while the internet was suitably impressed with the feat of landing a probe on a comet millions of miles from @entity122 , some took the time to point out the lesser milestones we have yet to pass although there are plenty of @entity8 parodies circulating on the internet , the online community has been unusually reserved in its mockery , perhaps because the actual images coming from the @entity11 probe are so incredible , or because tech - savvy users are still in awe of space exploration			1
as for @entity11 itself , scientists are still puzzling over the best way to keep the probe alive after it failed to latch on to the comet on its first approach , bounced , and landed in a cave			2
to make matters worse , the probe is currently on its side , with one leg pointing out into space , meaning its main solar panels are without access to sunlight			0
toying around : another @entity30 poster imagined what the @entity11 probe would look like made out of @entity153 - and it 's surprisingly similar to the original dr @entity101 attracted a lot of comments online for his tattoo sleeves and bizarre fashion sense - thought his shirt did attract criticism for being offensive to women scientists now have 24 hours to figure out a way to get @entity11 upright before the probe battery dies , or risk putting it into hibernation until the comet comes closer to the sun in a few months			1
the team are considering using a ' hop ' manoeuvre in order to right the probe , but gravity on @entity13 is several hundred thousand times weaker than on @entity122 , so the probe could bounce off into space			0
in the meantime , scientists have begun deploying instruments , have received data from temperature probes , and are planning to deploy a drill ' in very risky conditions ' to collect soil samples			0
@entity11 is currently resting on its side on comet @entity13 causing a huge problem for scientists as its two main solar panels are in the shade , meaning it is running out of power the team operating @entity11 now face either putting the probe into hibernation until the comet comes closer to the sun , or attempting a ' hop ' manoeuvre in order to get it upright			2

@entity11 probe landed on comet @entity202 two days ago after decade - long mission
but it took internet users just hours to begin mocking the achievement
@entity30 hashtag also mocked lesser milestones humanity has yet to pass
