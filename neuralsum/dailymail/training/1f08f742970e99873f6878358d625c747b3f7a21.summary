the first full moon of the year - known as the @entity2 - lit up the night 's sky last night			1
while much of the @entity4 was shrouded in mist and cloud , elsewhere in the world stargazers were treated to clear views of the @entity10 's pockmarked surface			0
january 's full moon became known as the @entity2 due to the howling of hungry wolves that often accompanied it at the height of winter			1
some of the best views were seen in @entity21 , @entity22 , but in the north of @entity35 , like @entity36 , in @entity37 , clear skies also allowed some to see the moon glow a rich orange as it rose in the sky			0
it is not just werewolves that have sleepless nights when there is a full moon			1
research has shown that many people get less overall sleep and reduced levels of deep sleep when there is a full moon in the sky			1
new research shows it ’s not just werewolves and vampires who get little or no sleep on night ’s like tomorrow when there is a full moon			2
the study , led by experts at the @entity63 in @entity64 , that on nights when there is a full moon it takes some people nearly twice as long to fall asleep - up to an hour - as on darker nights			1
women took an average of 52 minutes to nod off , compared to 25 to 30 minutes when there was no full moon			2
men took up to 60 minutes , compared with half an hour at other times			0
for centuries , there has been a widespread belief that the moon exerts a powerful effect on human sleep patterns , as well as health and behaviour			0
in @entity86 the @entity85 issued a warning of strong rip currents off its coast as the full moon brought a powerful spring tide			2
@entity94 parties in @entity95 , @entity96 , were also expected to attract more than 40,000 holiday makers			0
this year 's @entity2 , sometimes called the @entity98 , also coincided with the @entity31 reaching perihelion , the closest point to the sun in its orbit			1
this brought the @entity31 just 91.4 million miles from the sun , making the full moon appear slightly brighter			1
however , the bright glare from the sunlight reflected from the lunar surface meant the annual @entity110 meteor shower , which peaked in the early hours of sunday morning , was difficult to see			0
the full moon and the meteor shower are the first of a number of astronomical events due to delight astronomers in january			2
@entity116 is also visible in the northern hemisphere for the first time since it was discovered in august by the @entity120 amateur astronomer @entity119			2
it will be closest to the @entity31 on 7 january and should be visible in binoculars for around a week			1
three planets will line up in the southwest of the sky just after sunset on 10 january with both @entity127 and @entity128 visible alongside each other and @entity130 further to the left			1
the rising @entity2 glowed bright orange as fishermen and walkers on @entity135 in @entity36 looked on @entity116 is currently whizzing northwards past @entity31 , leaving an incredible glowing green tail in its wake the first full moon to occur in january is known as the @entity2 as it was often accompanied by howling in @entity139 from hungry wolf packs as they searched for food during the cold , lean days of winter @entity127 will be particularly bright in january and will make @entity128 alongside it easy to spot in the evenings a good view of @entity145 will also materialise to the left of the waning crescent moon on 16 january			1
views of the planet @entity149 are also expected to be among the highlights in the night 's sky this month			0
the middle of january will enjoy several moonless hours each evening and will give astronomers a good view of the stars that are normally drowned out by the light from the sun. among these could be the red star @entity161 will sit alongside @entity145 as the two brightest points on the southeastern horizon			0
the constellation of @entity165 , the charioteer , will be high in the south , with the brightest star @entity168 , nearly completely overhead			0
@entity116 , photographed here above @entity170 in @entity171 , was first spotted above @entity120 in august the @entity2 , still low in the sky , is seen though a @entity174 wreath in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22			0

january 's full moon is named after the howling of wolf packs as they search for food during the cold winter *conditions* at this time of year
@entity94 coincided with @entity31 's perihelion in its orbit around the sun
@entity116 will make its closest pass to the @entity31 on 7 january
@entity127 , @entity128 and @entity130 will line up in the nights sky later this month
