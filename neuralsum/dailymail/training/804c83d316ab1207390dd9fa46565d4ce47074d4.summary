sir @entity0 has admitted he omitted sir @entity1 from @entity2 's @entity3 line up because of his fractured relationship with @entity6			1
@entity0 faced some criticism for excluding @entity8 , particularly after @entity6 crashed out only a few days into the race			1
speaking at the leaders in @entity12 conference at @entity13 on wednesday , @entity0 says he had to put the feelings of team leader @entity6 first , and felt the inclusion of @entity8 in the nine man team when they clearly loathe one another would be counter-productive			1
sir @entity1 was snubbed from this year 's @entity3 line up ' you can have a nice popular team if you want but popularity does n't always win , ' said @entity0 in clear reference to the disappointment felt that @entity8 would not be riding the three @entity24 stages of this year 's @entity3			1
' forget @entity25 , ' he said			0
' i had a few of my own to deal with , and there are challenges			0
' we had a tricky season with two big champions , big personalities - very driven			0
' a number of times people said to me ' why do n't you get @entity6 and @entity37 in a room , bang their heads together and tell them to get on with it '			2
@entity6 was preferred to @entity8 , but his bid for glory was ended by injury ' that would have been the easiest thing to do			1
but over three weeks in @entity46 you are travelling together in the morning , racing , then travelling after and eating together			0
it would have been like a @entity50 scenario			0
' i had to ask myself if that was going to be optimal for the team in that environment			2
and the answer was no. ' our best chance of winning the @entity3 lay in @entity6 's hands and i had to build the team around @entity6			1
' you get challenging scenarios ; difficult decisions that can be fairly uncomfortable			0
but my analysis was , do we want to win ? ' sir @entity0 has defended his decision to leave out @entity8 from the @entity2 squad after a difficult year for @entity2 – that followed back - to - back wins at the @entity3 – @entity0 said he was considering ripping up the blueprint that has delivered so much success and starting again			1
' i 'm not trying to work out what a sports team in 2020 is going to look like , ' he said			0
he also said @entity8 would be targeting the iconic hour record in june			0
' there is a plan for him to do it and i 'm sure he can do it , ' said @entity0			2
' when you look at the riders who could go for the hour record , and feasibly achieve a better distance than @entity80 's just achieved , then i think @entity1 's probably one of the most accomplished			2

sir @entity1 omitted from @entity2 's nine man team
@entity6 's bid for glory was *ultimately* ended by injury
