an anti-pornography watchdog group has assailed the @entity1 for giving an r rating to @entity3 , which is based on a series of erotic novels			2
morality in @entity7 says the rating and accompanying reasoning given by the @entity1 set a dangerous precedent by failing to properly acknowledge the film 's sexual violence			1
the group wants the rating bumped to an @entity15 - 17 and tweaked to include references it says more accurately portray the film 's more lurid content			1
too permissive ? anti-pornography watchdog group @entity20 attacked the @entity1 for its decision last week to assign @entity3 an r rating instead of an @entity15 - 17 the @entity1 handed down the r rating for what it described as the film 's ' strong sexual content including dialogue , some unusual behavior and graphic nudity ' reports @entity30			1
the term ' unusual behavior ' -- no doubt that of stars @entity35 and @entity36 -- is what has @entity6 in @entity7 most outraged			0
' what the term " unusual " does not account for is the coercion , sexual violence , female inequality , and bdsm themes from which the entire plot is based , ' the group 's statement , obtained by @entity40 , reads			2
' such a vague evaluation puts viewers at risk , sending the message that humiliation is pleasurable and that torture should be sexually gratifying			2
' morality in @entity54 says the @entity1 description of the film , which designates behavior in the film as simply ' unusual ' sets a dangerous precedent for viewers whose takeaway might be that sexual violence and female inequality are positive things along with the harsher rating of @entity15 - 17 , which would ban children from entry even with an adult , the group wants to change the @entity1 description of @entity3 to read : ‘ promotes torture as sexually gratifying , graphic nudity , encourages stalking and abuse of power , promotes female inequality , glamorizes and legitimizes violence against women			1
' the group 's outrage , however , is surely only fueling anticipation for the february 13 release of the film based on the @entity83 novel of the same name			0
at the very least , star @entity36 is n't convinced of his breakout film 's unfitness for an r rating			0
he told @entity88 : ' if people make such a hoo - hah about the violence against women aspect of it , it ’s far more common for men to be the submissive			0
and it ’s consensual ! there ’s weirder s * * * than that			0

pornography watchdog @entity20 says the @entity1 is encouraging sexual violence by letting the movie by without an @entity15 - 17 rating
in describing the film , the @entity1 refers to ' unusual behavior ' - the morality group says that *glosses* over its *harmful* *depiction* of sexual *deviance*
@entity20 wishes to *update* the @entity1 rating to read ' promotes torture as sexually gratifying ' among other changes
