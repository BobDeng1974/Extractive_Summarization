by @entity0 the mum of a 15 - month - old toddler who got a coin lodged in his throat has described how lucky she feels that her son survived the drama			1
@entity8 , 39 , from @entity9 , @entity7 had to rush to save her son @entity10 after he began to cough and retch after something got stuck in his throat			1
the quick - thinking mum said that she was at home with her son @entity10 who was sitting on the carpet at the other end of the living room when she saw him pick up something on the floor , put it in his mouth and swallow it			1
lucky boy : @entity23 stands with his mum @entity24 who saved him when he nearly choked after accidentally swallowed a penny x-ray : the x-ray shows a one pence piece stuck in little @entity10 's throat which he accidentally put it in his mouth what 's this mum : @entity10 looks at the one pence piece that he put in his mouth which is now safely in a toddler proof container which he will not be able to open she said : ' it was like it happened in slow motion - before i could stop him he had already swallowed the coin			1
it 's so strange because he 's usually such a cautious little boy , he 's not one to throw himself into something without checking with me first , usually he 'd show me what he 'd found rather than putting it straight into his mouth			1
' i rushed over to him and he was coughing , choking			0
his lips started to turn a little bit blue			0
it was really scary and just horrendous , but as strange as it sounds , i was really calm about it all			0
' i 'm not first aid trained but i think as a mother you see all sorts of things , and i knew that i needed to stay calm			0
it was my job to stay calm and reassure him			0
if i had panicked we would n't have got anything done sooner			0
' i picked him up and tried to soothe him , while thinking about what i should do			0
after just a couple of minutes , he seemed to calm down			0
he was n't gasping for breath , he seemed to be quite relaxed , but i knew that i needed to get him to hospital			2
however , the family lives in a remote area so help was not readily available so she had to do all that she could at home at that very moment			1
she added : ' it 's a miracle he survived really			2
the coin was lodged right at the top of his throat			1
luckily it went down his food pipe instead of his windpipe , otherwise the outcome could have been horribly different			0
' but because it was so close to the top of the pipe , at any moment it could have flipped up and gone down his windpipe			2
the full time mum lives with her partner @entity85 , 42 , and her other three children @entity86 , 11 , @entity88 , ten , and nine - year - old @entity89			1
@entity91 mum : @entity8 said she is not first aid trained but knew that she needed to stay calm she added : ' i decided not to ring for an ambulance because we live in such a rural area that i know it takes so long for an ambulance to get to us , so i got in the car and drove us to @entity100			1
they rushed straight up to x-ray and from the picture they could see that the coin was lodged right at the top of @entity10 's throat			1
she remembers that she tried to keep him calm so the coin was n't dislodged , but her son seemed to be fine and quite happy			1
she added : ' the doctors decided they had to send him to a hospital with a specialist anaesthetist for children			2
' we waited for an ambulance and then it took about half an hour to get to the hospital , so we arrived at @entity117 [ hospital ] around three hours after he swallowed the coin			1
' as soon as we got there they took him up to theatre and gave him a general anaesthetic , and pulled the object out with what i think were like some pincers			0
thankfully , they did n't have to make any cuts			0
' when he came round , he was fine			2
we gave him some milk and because he 'd kept it down they said to us that after a few hours he was fine to go @entity132 then he 's been absolutely fine			2
the grateful mother realises that her quick thinking actions saved her child 's life and she said that she ca n't believe she was so calm , but she knew that panicking would n't help			2
she said : ' you 're all a child has got in that moment to sort things out for them , that was my job and i 'm glad it ended so well			0
' ' i feel very lucky that we 've got a happy ending - it just makes you appreciate what you 've got , really			0

mum @entity8 had to save her son after he swallowed a coin at home
but the family lives in a remote area where the local hospital is miles away
she jumped in her car and drove to @entity159 's @entity100
an x-ray showed the coin was lodged in the top of the boy 's throat
it was removed by doctors and the child is now doing fine - thanks to mum
