by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 3 september 2013 an @entity2 woman who swam 20km wearing a hijab has been denied the official record because her outfit showed her ' feminine features '			1
@entity7 designed a special ' @entity9 ' bathing suit adding 6kg to her weight so that she would be allowed to attempt the long - distance swim on the @entity13 in june			1
but the outfit was apparently not modest enough for the country 's conservative religious authorities , and her record was not officially recognised			2
plea : @entity7 was denied a 20km swimming record because of her ' immodest ' outfit the 32 - year - old took nine hours to swim the 20km ( 12.4 miles ) , setting out from the town of @entity22 into the freezing waters of the @entity13			1
she did so in defiance of officials who are opposed to women swimming in open waters because of the risk of displaying their body shapes to men			2
even though ms @entity7 wore a loose - fitting swimsuit which included a headscarf , the authorities were opposed to her efforts - and refused to acknowledge that she had made it the full 20km			1
' they said no matter how @entity9 my swimming gear , it was unacceptable , ' she told the @entity40 earlier this year			0
' they said the feminine features of my body were showing as i came out of water			0
' @entity45 : the 32 - year - old was wearing a hijab swimsuit which mostly hid the shape of her body ' @entity50 features ' : @entity2 authorities are keen to discourage women from swimming in open waters in a bid to gain public support for her battle against the authorities , she made a haunting video of herself swimming around while wearing the swimsuit - which she claims most swimmers would be unable to handle			1
' i swam 20km in @entity22 , they lowered it to 15km , ' she says in the video , posted on @entity67			1
' i protested and they accepted 18km			0
yet now , they do not register the record			0
' my 20km record has been held hostage in the hands of people who can not even swim a distance of 20 metres			2
' the video then cuts to ms @entity7 sitting in a car wearing a headscarf , when she delivers an inspirational message aimed not just at fellow swimmers but at all women living in the theocratic state			1
' i 'm not going to submit to bullying , and i ask you not to submit either , ' she says			0
' i ask you to give your utmost effort to achieve your goals			0
' video : ms @entity7 made a haunting @entity67 clip in a bid to win public support anger : the swimmer has had a number of run - ins with the conservative religious authorities the @entity22 incident is not the first time the swimmer has met with official resistance to her athletic activities			2
during a previous open - water swim , ms @entity7 was blocked by police boats which ended up cutting her legs with their propellers			0
women in @entity2 are allowed to swim in segregated swimming pools , and to compete in the @entity107 which are held periodically in @entity108			2
however , they are banned from travelling to competitions abroad , and the authorities frown on swimming in open waters			0
' they fear that if they recognise my record then they would unwittingly approve my swimming gear and that would eventually give women swimmers access to open waters , ' ms @entity7 told the @entity40			1
she has expressed hope that the new regime led by @entity124 might prove more accommodating than that of @entity126 .			0

@entity7 swam 20km on the @entity13 wearing special hijab
but officials refused to recognise the record because of her outfit
she has taken to @entity67 to plead for justice for all @entity2 women
