by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 11:04 est , 8 january 2014 with energy costs continuing to rise , a @entity3 firm has created a way of powering small household appliances using sports equipment			2
each time a player kicks the @entity11 football , a built - in mechanism converts the kinetic energy into an electrical charge			1
this charge can then be used to power specially - designed lights , as well as other small appliances , via a built - in usb port			1
each time the ball is kicked , a pendulum inside moves and as this pendulum swings , it turns a generator connected to a rechargeable battery			1
specially - designed lights , pictured , can then be connected to the ball via usb port			1
@entity11 costs $ 99 ( £ 60 ) each time the ball is kicked , a pendulum ( pictured ) inside the ball moves			1
as this pendulum swings , it turns a generator connected to a rechargeable battery			1
this stored energy can be used to power a small light , plugged into the ball using a usb port			2
this usb port can also be used to connect other items , including phones , to the device			0
half an hour of play provides three hours of light , for example			0
the @entity11 project was originally a @entity50 campaign set up by @entity3 - based firm @entity51			1
the company set a target of $ 75,000 ( £ 45,600 ) and achieved a total of $ 92,296 ( £ 56,100 ) by the time the campaign closed in march			0
@entity11 uses the firm ’s patented @entity57 technology			2
each time the ball is kicked , a pendulum inside it swings , and these swings turn a generator connected to a rechargeable battery			1
this stored energy can be used to power a small light , plugged into the ball using a usb port			2
this usb port can also be used to connect other small household items , including phone chargers , to the device			2
according to @entity51 , half an hour of kicking the ball provides three hours of power			2
the ball 's built - in usb port can also be used to connect other items , including phones , to the device			1
half an hour of play provides three hours of power the ball is made of foam and leather and never needs to be inflated			1
it is also sturdy and can be kicked without damaging the inside			0
@entity51 has already tested the ball in communities across @entity88 and @entity89 , and said the technology is ideal for areas with poor electricity networks the ball is made of foam and leather and never needs to be inflated			0
it is also sturdy and can be kicked without damaging the inside , claims the company			0
@entity51 has already tested the ball in poor communities across @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity100 and said the technology is ideal for areas with basic electrical networks			0
soccket balls are available from the @entity51 website for $ 99 ( £ 60 ) each			0
the company have also created the pulse skipping rope , which harnesses kinetic energy in a similar way to the @entity11 , but can instead be used to power small applications and charge mobile phones			0

the @entity116 costs $ 129 ( £ 78 )			0

@entity11 is a foam football covered in leather fitted with a pendulum
each time the ball is kicked , the pendulum swings and turns a generator
this generator then charges a built - in battery which powers usb lights
this port *doubles* up as a phone charger and can power other devices
@entity3 - based firm claims *30* minutes of play gives three hours of power
