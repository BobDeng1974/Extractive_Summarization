by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 13 march 2013 it was a scene straight out of @entity2 , played out in real life			2
the father of eight - year - old @entity5 would have been forgiven for shouting out @entity8 's classic catchphrase @entity6 ! after realising what his cheeky son had done			1
@entity5 had been regularly using the family @entity12 to play @entity13 @entity14 and often bought the virtual doughnuts on offer to help progress through the game			1
expensive : @entity19 and @entity20 were left furious after their eight - year - old son ran up a £ 1,000 bill after buying virtual doughnuts on an @entity26 game			1
mr @entity5 and son @entity27 are pictured however , little did the eager youngster know that he was racking up an enormous £ 980 bill for his parents			1
@entity19 and @entity20 , from @entity31 , only realised that their son had spent the huge amount after their bank account had been completely cleared			1
mr @entity5 , an estate agent , said : ' it was only when my wife rang me and asked where all the money had gone that we found out what had happened			1
' she got a statement and saw there were more than 100 purchases on @entity47 for between £ 1.50 and £ 75 , from the middle of january and the beginning of this month			2
' we received no emails alerting us to what was happening			0
' mr @entity5 said it is too easy for children to buy additional items without being asked for any more details to confirm the purchase			0
pricey : @entity58 decided he needed extra help to progress on his @entity61 game @entity14 and thought nothing of buying the virtual doughnuts on offer he said : ' @entity5 is only just eight and has no real concept of the monetary value attached			1
' as far as he was concerned he was just buying doughnuts			1
' we know others caught out by the same thing			0
a friend 's little girl spent £ 350 on a horse game			1
' one add - on was £ 69.95 for a little diamond to go in the horse 's mane			0
' @entity12 can be great for keeping them occupied but there has to be more control			1
' if you buy something on @entity84 you have to agree to pay for it , enter additional information to pay and then get a confirmation email so you can keep track			0
with the @entity12 it seems to be a free - for - all			0
' i appreciate children are their target audience but it is not right and there needs to be specific controls in place to stop this from happening			0
' i dread to think how many people this has happened to and how many it has happened to and they do n't even know about it because perhaps it was £ 50 and they did n't realise			0
' furious : @entity5 's parents were left astonished to find that their son had completely cleared their bank account by racking up a £ 980 bill on the game , pictured the family have now been refunded , having spent almost an hour on the phone to @entity112 representatives in @entity113 - but the @entity12 , for now , remains in a drawer			1
a spokesman for @entity112 said such incidents should be reported as soon as possible and were then looked at on a case - by - case basis			0
he said it was vital people kept their pass code , designed to stop unauthorised electronic purchases on its products , safe and said software was available to prevent children from using the @entity126 even if they have the password			0
he said : ' i explained exactly what had happened and it was a nervous wait but they agreed to refund it in the circumstances			0
pricey : @entity134 , 5 , ran up a huge bill on the @entity12 app @entity137 vs @entity138 the one saving grace for @entity5 is that he is not the first youngster to amass a huge amount of money on his parents ' computer			1
last month , five - year - old @entity134 , from @entity31 , made 19 purchases totalling more than £ 1,300 for extra software to help him play the game @entity137			2
@entity134 had asked his father for a passcode to download a game called @entity138 , which involves touching the @entity12 screen to aim ninja - style weapons at cartoon zombies			1
his parents then left him occupied while they entertained friends at their home			1
but by pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen , @entity134 was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ ammunition ’			0
he bought dozens of in - game ‘ weapons ’ and ‘ keys ’ which cost up to £ 69.99 a time			1
his parents were refunded after they contacted @entity112			2
the problem is of increasing concern in the @entity113 it emerged last month that @entity112 is to pay £ 66million in compensation to parents in @entity113 whose children run up massive bills using its free apps			2
now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund			0
however , the decision is unlikely to affect @entity176 families			0
a @entity113 legal case was triggered by a nine - year - old girl from @entity179 who bought $ 200 ( £ 132 ) of ' virtual money ' from three free @entity112 games			1
in a lawsuit brought by her father , the games were described as ' highly addictive ' and designed to ' compel ' children to buy game currency			1
under the terms of the case settlement , @entity112 has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $ 100million ( £ 66million )			0
' we got @entity5 and his sister @entity193 an @entity12 to help with their schoolwork but @entity5 's is away in a drawer at the moment			0
we just do n't have time to monitor what they are playing			0
' last month , five - year - old @entity134 made 19 purchases totalling more than £ 1,300 for extra software to help him play the game @entity137			2
his parents were also refunded after they contacted @entity112			2
a statement on @entity112 's website reads : ' all @entity207 devices ( @entity12 , @entity208 and @entity209 ) have built in parental controls that give parents and guardians the ability to restrict access to content , eg internet access and age - rated content such as music , games , apps , tv shows , movies etc. ' parental controls also give parents and guardians the option to turn off functionality such as purchasing from @entity47 and the ability to turn off in - app purchases			2
' our parents ' guide to @entity47 details the steps and measures parents and guardians can take to make sure younger players have access to the right content			2
the first thing we recommend is not to share your password			0

his parents left astonished to find their bank account had been *emptied*
' there has to be more control , ' said his estate agent father
