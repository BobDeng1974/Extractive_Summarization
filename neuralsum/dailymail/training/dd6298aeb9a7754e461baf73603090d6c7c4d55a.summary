by @entity0 last updated at 5:25 pm on 18th october 2011 patients are being banned by their gps simply for making minor complaints			1
entire families are being unfairly removed from practice lists and barred from making appointments following trivial disagreements with doctors or staff			2
one complaint concerned a woman who had merely replaced a flat battery in a device administering anti-sickness medicine to her terminally - ill mother			2
shocking : entire families are being unfairly removed from practice lists and barred from making appointments following trivial disagreements with doctors or staff ( picture posed by models ) the woman - who is a trained nurse - said she did not want her mother to suffer while they waited for the practice nurse to arrive for a home visit			1
do @entity28 gps have too much power ? but the surgery claimed her actions had undermined the doctor - patient relationship and the woman and her dying mother were told they would no longer be treated by the practice			2
a report by @entity39 @entity38 warns that increasing numbers of patients are being removed from doctors ' lists ' without fair warning or proper explanation '			1
once a patient has been taken off a surgery 's list they are not allowed to make any other appointments , forcing them to find another doctor			0
last year 2,581 complaints about @entity27 were made to the @entity54 , an average of seven a day			1
of the 48 complaints deemed serious enough for the ombudsman to investigate fully , ten - or 21 per cent - concerned patients who felt they had been unfairly removed			1
this is more than three times higher than the proportion recorded last year when only 6 per cent of the complaints properly investigated concerned patients being taken off surgery lists			1
warning : a report by the @entity54 said increasing numbers of patients were being removed from doctors ' lists ' without fair warning or proper explanation ' in one case , an elderly woman and her husband were removed after she wrote to the practice manager to complain that receptionists did not answer the phone while she was trying to book an appointment for their seasonal flu jabs			1
in a telephone call the practice manager warned them he would ‘ get you struck off for this ’			0
in my work as an addiction specialist , i received - and still do receive - complaints all the time			2
one man believes that @entity88 , together with the @entity89 , was involved in the murder of his sister and his aunt			0
another man , whom i saw twice , believes that i was responsible for his divorce - and the distress caused to his child - when i did not take his side against his wife , whom i had never met			0
that 's just the way it is in my line of work and i would offer them my help again if they asked for it			0
but all these patients must have gps somewhere and i would not blame those doctors at all if they said that enough is enough , says @entity112 @entity111 read more here shortly afterwards they were removed from the surgery ’s list			2
and a mother was barred by her gp after complaining to receptionists who had failed to find her an appointment to get her baby vaccinated before the family went on holiday			0
@entity126 , chief executive of campaigning charity the @entity128 , said : ‘ far too often patients tell us that they have been removed from their gp list without warning or explanation			1
‘ now the ombudsman says that over a fifth of complaints in the last year were about patients being removed from gp lists , which is more than three times higher than previous years			1
’ the report also warned that hospitals , gp surgeries and other @entity28 services were failing properly deal with complaints			0
the @entity54 added that the @entity28 was ‘ still not dealing adequately with the most straightforward matters ’			0
last night health minister @entity145 said : ‘ our ambition is for a modern @entity28 , which is more accountable for the quality of care it provides and gives patients a stronger voice			0
‘ that ’s why we need a culture of learning and listening in the @entity28 , so that mistakes are not repeated			0
