click here to read @entity2 's full match report from @entity3 having scored 19 goals before injuring his knee against @entity7 on december 6 , @entity4 has n't looked quite the same player since his comeback , to the obvious detriment of @entity13 's @entity12 title hopes			1
his work in around the penalty area was sharp enough against @entity16 but the most important bit - putting the ball in the back of the net - eldued him once again			2
the @entity20 , an unstoppable force before he limped off in tears clutching his knee at the @entity25 nearly two months ago , has n't scored in any of the four games he 's played since his return , and he had good chances to give @entity13 a victory their overall performance deserved			0
@entity4 ( right ) takes a long - range shot as the @entity13 striker searches for a first goal in 2015 the @entity36 superstar was guilty of several misses during the 1 - 1 draw with @entity16 at @entity3 the @entity13 talisman is still trying to find his form since been sidelined by injury two passable opportunities , and one extremely good one , fell his way in the first half			1
first , he fired at @entity46 when set up by @entity47 , then a moment 's hesitation allowed @entity50 to produce a saving tackle in the penalty area			0
most damagingly of all , after @entity53 slipped , @entity4 was allowed to run free to the edge of the area where a slightly hurried finish arced away from @entity46 and beyond the far post			0
it was a chance he would have buried in the autumn			0
@entity16 were without suspended striker @entity61 ( right ) and injured playmaker @entity62 ( left ) @entity64 wheels away in celebration after handing @entity16 the lead at @entity3 @entity16 players celebrate at the corner flag after the @entity70 international breaks the first half deadlock those misses seemed particularly costly when @entity64 converted a flowing @entity16 move from close range to fire the home side ahead after 41 minutes			1
but at least @entity4 made partial amends by setting up @entity13 's equaliser on the stroke of half - time for @entity47 , the forward firing a left - foot shot across the six - yard box for @entity47 to convert after @entity16 goalkeeper @entity82 had fumbled a punch			1
@entity64 's strike had appeared to justify @entity86 's decision to select him ahead of @entity87 to replace the suspended ' stamper ' @entity61			1
@entity4 's speculative shot was turned in by @entity47 ( left ) for @entity13 's equaliser @entity47 ( top ) and @entity4 celebrate after combining to bring @entity13 level in the first half but it was @entity13 who dominated the rest of the game with @entity4 's clever dribbles possessing a threat to @entity53 and company in the @entity16 back four			1
in the end though , it was @entity4 's end product , one of the reasons he was an early contender for @entity105 , that let him down			0
if he 'd been 100 per cent , @entity106 would have left him on until final knockings instead of removing him for @entity107 for the final six minutes			0
@entity4 has a shot blocked by young @entity16 defender @entity50 ( right ) @entity4 has been a shadow of his former self since suffering a long - term knee injury in december @entity4 was good but not the player who scored a stunning hat - trick against @entity114 earlier in the campaign			2
even though the title race is never properly won or lost at the end of january , @entity106 will need the ' old ' @entity4 back between now and may if @entity13 are to have a chance of retaining their title			2
luckily for @entity13 , spring is known as the season of new beginnings .			0

@entity16 drew 1 - 1 with @entity13 in their @entity12 clash
@entity64 opened the scoring in place of suspended @entity61
@entity47 equalised but @entity4 is yet to discover his best form
