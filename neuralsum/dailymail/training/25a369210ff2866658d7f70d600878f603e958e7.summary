by @entity0 a @entity2 wildlife photographer captured the dramatic moment a plague of @entity5 swarmed across the countryside @entity7 was in @entity8 , north of @entity9 when she spotted what she initially thought was a dust storm			1
however , within moments , ms @entity7 realised that the 1,000 foot high column was alive and made of insects			1
wildlife photographer @entity15 spotted the bizarre tower of bugs while driving along the road north of @entity9 in @entity2 ms @entity7 had initially thought the column was made of dust created by dangerously high winds and initially sought somewhere to shelter according to ms @entity7 , animals including horses seemed disturbed as the column of locusts formed around a quarter of a mile away the large group of locusts disappeared before they approached ms @entity30 's position the phenomena - dubbed a @entity31 - was made of red locusts who scour the farmland looking for food			1
she said : ' at first i believed it was a wind twister , the animals around me were very nervous			0
' i stayed in my place and looked for a safe place , but there was none , and at the same time the twister was never reaching me			0
' so i entered my car and drove towards it			0
after same metres i realised that an enormous amount of insects were in fact the tornado			2
' i suppose it would be better a wind twister , than a bug twister , ' she said			0
the locusts disappeared before arriving at ms @entity7 's position on the roadway			1
' i can not imagine what could happen to me if they had caught me			0
' it 's not known for sure what kind of bugs make up this swarm , but they may be red locusts			2
' the swarm extended perhaps 1,000 ft. it was nearly a quarter of a mile away from my position and i took the picture with a 200 mm lens			0
' perspective makes the leading edge of the swarm appear smaller and thus tapered			0
' the red locust can have a devastating impact on the developing world where outbreaks can threaten 15 million people with starvation			1

@entity79 figures suggest that one tonne of red locusts will eat enough food to nourish 2,500 people for a day			2
the @entity79 runs special eradication schemes across large areas of @entity82 to keep red locust numbers down			2
according to the @entity97 a red locust can eat its own bodyweight in food each day while traveling between 20 - 30 kilometres			1
