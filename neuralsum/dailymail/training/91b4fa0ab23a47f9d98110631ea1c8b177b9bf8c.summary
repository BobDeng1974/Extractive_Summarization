by @entity0 professional origami artist @entity1 is hoping to push - or should that be fold - the envelope of his art form by creating a life - size elephant from a single piece of paper measuring 15 metres square			1
the extraordinary work of art requires four people working for two weeks to turn the two dimensional sheet into a three metre tall structure			2
over more than a month , @entity11 - based mr @entity1 , 33 , has painstakingly planned the intricate pattern , which details where exactly and in what order , to fold the paper			1
mr @entity1 then plans to erect the elephant in the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity11 , while being filmed by several cameras for a watching public			1
but he now needs to secure the money to pay to turn his dream into a reality			0
plans : @entity1 has spent more than a month working out the intricate pattern of folds required to turn the art from two to three dimensions intricate : each fold in the paper will have to be in the perfect position @entity48 : the @entity49 - based @entity1 needs to raise $ 24,000 to make his life - size elephant project a reality he is attempting to crowdsource the $ 24,000 required to launch the project			1
so far , donors have pledged nearly $ 17,000 - $ 7,000 short of his total - with just 17 days left			0
mr @entity1 said : ' as an ultimate proof that there are no limits to what can be made out of a uncut square piece of paper , i plan to fold a life - size replica of an elephant			1
' over the course of several weeks the monumental sculpture will be folded at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity11			2
a team of three assistants will support me on this mission			0
practise : this small model shows how origami artist @entity1 would go about making his three metre tall elephant heavy lifting : @entity1 will need three assistants to manipulate the huge sheet of paper support : donors have pledged nearly $ 17,000 - $ 7,000 short of his total origami in action : the tiny elephant , on which @entity11 artist @entity1 will base the life - size version , begins to take shape ' using a sheet measuring 15 by 15 meters , we will create an elephant standing more than 3 meters tall			1
' further more we will install two cameras which will be feeding footage to an online live video stream , so you , your friends and family can watch us as we fold			0
' he added : ' i believe that @entity76 and the @entity93 are so fascinating due to the prevalent belief that the use of only one piece of paper is very limiting			0
drama : origami artist @entity1 wants to turn the creation of a life - size elephant into a piece of performance art 2d to @entity103 : artist @entity1 will film his origami evolving from a flat sheet of paper into an elephant taking shape : the unmistakable elephant shape is created from dozens of creases ' but actually the very contrary is the case			1
in the art form of origami a simple piece of paper can be transformed into anything imaginable			2
' it ’s exactly this transformation , which in my opinion stands for many struggles we have to overcome in life			0
this project will be a great experience for us to share with you			0
' hopefully it will change public ’s perception of origami and make people realize what a powerful art form it can be			2
mapped out : this series of lines shows the complex number of folds required to make the life - size elephant origami exhibit : @entity49 - based @entity1 plans to create and exhibit his monumental art work inside the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity11 , pictured for mr @entity1 this project is the culmination of a life 's dedication to his art. since the age of five , he has been obsessed with refining and perfecting his origami skills , creating an array of stunning figures , including human figures , birds , delicate flowers and insects			1
he has also had some of his work displayed in art galleries around the world			0
