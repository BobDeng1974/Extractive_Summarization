her father , @entity10 , said that while his daughter is showing signs of improvement , doctors might be forced to amputate her hands and right foot			1
' her fingers basically appear mummified , ' said mr @entity18 at a press conference with his wife @entity20 and daughter @entity21 , 25 , reports @entity22			2
however , the family remain optimistic , as a neurologist and cardiopulmonologist have said there is no brain damage or irreversible injury to the lungs , which were under attack			1
previously they had stated her chances of survival were ' slim to none '			2
mr @entity18 describes his daughter as ' outdoorsy ' and a ' lover of people ' and hopes that she will eventually finish her master 's degree			2
' what we 've got is nothing short of a miracle			2
my baby is alive and her mind is good			2
i know we have a difficult road ahead , but right now we 're rejoicing , ' he said			2

' miss @entity2 was kayaking along the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , when she stopped to ride a home - made zipline			1
the line snapped , and she suffered a gash to her left calf , which required two dozen staples to close			1
after initially being turned away several times from medics with nothing more than pain killers and antibiotics , horrified doctors realised an aggressive flesh - eating bacteria - aeromonas hydrophila - had invaded the increasingly agonising wound			1

' @entity2 went to the doctor and received a prescription for antibiotics and posted a clean @entity104 report , ' he said			1
' again , she was treated and released			0
' on friday morning the student was driven to the emergency room by a concerned friend			0
pale and weak , she received a shocking diagnosis : she was suffering from necrotizing fasciitis , a rare flesh - eating bacteria that can destroy skin , fat and muscle			0
physicians told the young woman the infection had already spread to her thigh and hip , and that her whole leg would have to be amputated			2
miss @entity2 was flown to the @entity121 in @entity76 , where doctors performed a high - hip amputation of her left leg and removed further infected tissue from her abdomen			1
fun loving : @entity2 's father , @entity10 , says describes her as ' outdoorsy ' and a ' lover of people ' ' the surgeons advised me that they wanted to try to save her leg , but at this point saving her life took precedence , ' mr @entity18 said on @entity137			1
' they removed all of the infected tissue and advised that she would have limited , if any use of her leg			1
' ' @entity2 [ cardiac ] arrested when they moved her from the operating table , but they were able to successfully resuscitate her , ' he added			1
writing on @entity137 on 6 may , he concluded : ' i type this factual progression of @entity2 ’s condition as a way to better cope with what is without a doubt the most horrific situation that a parent can possibly imagine			1
' we take so much for granted in life , but i never imagined that one of my daughters would face this most unlikely of situations			0
' i hope and pray that when you read this that the news we receive at sunrise will be positive			0
at this point , no news is good news , but all i know to do is hope and pray for the best			0
i only ask that you all do the same			0
' the @entity75 in @entity76 , where @entity2 is receiving vital medical care friends and co-workers from the @entity168 in @entity55 , where miss @entity2 works , have banded together to support her family			1

necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			0
' @entity209 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			0
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			0
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			0
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			0
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			1
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			2
patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up , to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons .			0
