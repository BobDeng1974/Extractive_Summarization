a 25ft - high tidal wave of rubbish : the @entity2 financial capital banned disposable plastic shopping bags and styrofoam food containers as part of escalating efforts across the nation 's capital to curb rubbish that exacerbates deadly flooding cause : men play basketball near the dump site - the project officer of @entity15 's environmental services department , said cutting down on plastic was vital to stop the clogging of the city 's waterways , which is widely blamed for contributing to floods food wrapped in plastic is still available , but @entity15 , one of 17 cities or districts that make up @entity40 , has gone ahead with banning plastic bags			1
@entity42 , project officer of @entity15 's environmental services department , told @entity43 that scaling back the use of plastic bags was essential to halt the clogging of the city 's waterways , which is widely blamed for contributing to floods			1
' during our bi-monthly wastewater clean - ups , we found most of the garbage is plastics , ' she said			2
flooding is common in @entity53 - last august the @entity2 capital was brought to a near standstill by flooding after almost 24 hours of continuous rain - it left nine dead and scores homeless			1
the previous year flash floods in the @entity2 left a death toll of 1000			2
nature ruined : fishermen sit on a rubbish - filled riverbank at a dump site in @entity40			1
consumers are now being given the option of paper alternatives or not using a bag at all making a living : a man arranges used plastic bottles on a truck to be sold at a shop in @entity40 all change : a man uses a cloth bag while buying meat at a wet market in @entity40 's financial district , @entity15 binned : employees of a fast food store put the prohibited plastic cups into a trash bag at @entity40 's financial district watchful eye : members of @entity15 's @entity14 ( @entity86 ) , look for prohibited plastic used used by vendors at a wet market the ban in @entity15 - the ninth out of the 17 areas to issue the plastics ban - means 6.7 million of @entity40 's population of 13 million people are covered by the restrictions , reported @entity43			1
the campaign to ban plastic bags is gathering momentum - in may 2003 , @entity97 set the pace by banning thinner plastic bags as well as imposing levies on thicker ones - @entity104 and @entity105 have now banned bags completely			2
@entity107 , @entity97 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 have all banned very thin plastic bags - the latter for the same reason as @entity40			2
all plastic bags except oxo - biodegradables are banned in the @entity116 after concerns about the risk to camels			0
last year @entity120 became the biggest city in the @entity122 to ban plastic bags from supermarket check - outs following bans in @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			0
in 2009 , the @entity129 reported that 102 billion plastic bags are used annually in the @entity122 alone last month @entity132 's decision not to back a @entity134 law banning plastic bags caused friction with @entity137 and stunned environmental campaigners			1
@entity137 's environment minister has criticised @entity132 's lack of support for the law , describing it as ' astounding ' particularly for a seafaring nation			1
environmental campaigners have also been left flabbergasted by @entity132 's move earlier this month , especially given the @entity147 government 's support for reducing the environmental impact of bags on the landscape and wildlife			1
@entity40 is prone to flooding , as seen in this photo taken last year so authorities are doing everything possible to clear drainage system - including banning plastic bags the average @entity159 citizen gets through about 500 plastic carrier bags a year – with most of them used once , according to @entity162			2
the total volume produced in @entity134 in 2008 was 3.4million tons , but only 6 per cent were recycled			0
despite their widespread use , research suggests most @entity134 want to see a clampdown on carrier bags , with two thirds of people surveyed by the @entity129 saying they favoured an outright ban			0
last year , @entity137 became the first @entity134 country to ban non-biodegradable single - use plastic bags			0
across the globe , @entity105 , @entity104 and @entity174 have done the same			0
in @entity132 , the first big high street chain to make customers pay for carrier bags was @entity179 , in 2008			0
the 5p charge led to a fall of 80 per cent in bag usage in the first few months			0
the @entity183 introduced a 12p levy on each bag in 2002 , which led to a 95 per cent reduction in plastic bag litter			0
last october , @entity188 imposed a 5p charge			0
shops that continue to provide free carrier bags face a fine of up to £ 5,000			0
but some retailers , including @entity194 , have resisted a bag charge , with @entity194 ’s saying that free plastic bags were ‘ critical ’ to its customers .			0
