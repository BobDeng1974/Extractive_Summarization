a man giving doctors a demonstration on how 3d printers can assist surgery collapsed with a kidney stone - then made a model of his own organ to help his operation			1
@entity9 , who owns a 3d printing services company , was giving a talk on the medical uses of the technology at @entity14			1
but during the demonstration in october last year he passed out in agony and was rushed to the facility 's own @entity18 department for scans			1
after doctors removed his appendix that afternoon , they said mr @entity9 would need a further operation to extract a kidney stone			1
@entity9 used his firm 's @entity27 software to make a model of his own kidney before having surgery to remove a stone from it			1
the model cut the operation time significantly and helped guide surgeons scans revealed the stone was big - 3.5cm - and shaped like a stag 's head ( left picture , left of centre )			1
mr @entity9 was able to work from images taken by surgeons to make the model scans revealed the stone was big - 3.5cm - and shaped like a stag 's head			1
while waiting for the second operation , which was conducted on monday , mr @entity9 used his 3d printer technology to make a model of his kidney			1
he said : ' while i was lying in the hospital bed i thought " hang on , we could utilise the technology "			0
' i talked it all through with the surgeon and we decided we would try and create a model of my kidney			2
' and surgeons at @entity63 did end up using the fake organ as a guide during the op. medics say having the plastic kidney slashed an hour from his two - hour kidney stone removal operation on monday			1
mr @entity9 , 46 , of @entity63 , @entity71 , said : ' while giving the demonstration , i collapsed on the floor in excruciating pain			1
they took me to the @entity18 and found i had appendicitis and a kidney stone			1
' they operated to remove the appendix that afternoon and as i was recovering and talking to the consultant i thought , hang on , we could utilise the 3d technology here			2
' he printed a model of his own kidney containing the inch - long stone , which was caused by a build - up of blood waste products in his kidney			1
mr @entity9 was able to work from images taken by surgeons - such as x-rays and mri scans - to make the model in just over four hours			1
mr @entity9 used his printer to produce a multi-coloured plaster of @entity99 kidney that can be opened up to reveal the stone inside			2
@entity63 has agreed to trial the process with 21 other patients to monitor the usefulness of the technology mr @entity9 printed a model of his own kidney , complete with the inch - long kidney stone it contained			1
to create an object from a 3d printer you can either create a design of it on an computer with 3d software or a scan of the object			0
the printer will then create the different layers and connect them together to create a 3d object			0

this took just over four hours			0
while @entity134 images are currently used to to plan the operations , surgeons believe up to an hour can be cut off procedure times by using 3d models to give medics more detailed briefings on the operation ahead			2
time can also be saved on explaining the procedure to patients and hopefully increase their approval of the operations			0

father - of - two mr @entity9 said : ' we hope it can save a lot of money too			0
the models cost Â£ 123 to produce but the savings in surgery time could be in the thousands			0
' @entity170 believes the technology could be a cost - effective way to speed up operations			0
he said : ' it makes our job easier going in			0
' this was a large stone , almost 3.5cm , so it 's quite a big bulk			0
' the 3d model helps because it gives us a rough estimation of where to come from and to be more precise			2

the process has featured in @entity201 and surgeons at a @entity203 created a @entity27 heart that saved the life of a two - week - old baby .			0

@entity9 was giving doctors a talk on medical uses of 3d printing
collapsed during demonstration and was rushed to @entity18 for scans
these revealed he needed appendix removed and he had kidney stones
while waiting for kidney op , decided to make 3d model of kidney and stone
medics say this slashed time from the op and helped guide the surgery
further 20 3d printed kidneys will now be trialled at @entity63
