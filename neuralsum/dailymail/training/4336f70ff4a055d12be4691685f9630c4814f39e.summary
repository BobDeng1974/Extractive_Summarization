by @entity0 the claims were made by @entity3 's chief operating officer , @entity2 , pictured , during an interview with @entity5 in @entity6 @entity3 has been heavily criticised by users and authorities alike about the way the site harvests personal data and uses it for advertising			1
but the social network ’s chief operating officer @entity2 has spoken out in defence of the site , vehemently denying sharing its user 's data			1
during an interview with @entity5 , @entity2 said @entity3 was very protective of its users ' privacy and personal data			1
she continued that despite the use of personalised ads , the site ' does nothing to compromise its user ’s data			1
' ' privacy is of the utmost concern and importance to @entity3 and it 's important to us that the people who use our service know that we are very protective of them , ' @entity2 explained			1
‘ it is their data , they have control of it , they share it			2
‘ when we are able to personalise ads , we are doing that without sharing their private data with any advertisers			1
’ her comments follow the launch of the @entity50 and @entity52 @entity51 at the company 's international headquarters in @entity55			0
this council aims to increase participation between @entity3 and small to medium - sized businesses			2
@entity2 said working with small to medium - sized businesses was important because ‘ our missions are inextricably tied and the challenge and the opportunity of this huge technological shift that we 're going through is one that we can work together ( on )			2
@entity2 said that despite the use of personalised ads , @entity3 ' does nothing to compromise its user 's data			1
privacy is of the utmost concern and importance to @entity3 and it 's important to us that the people who use our service know that we are very protective of them			1
it is their data , they have control of it , they share it ' when a company creates an advert , they can add a number of parameters to target the most appropriate people			2
these include the user 's location , gender , age , likes and interests , relationship status , workplace and education			0
rather than sharing this information directly with advertisers , @entity3 uses a process called hashing			1
for example , personal information such as email addresses and names are automatically encrypted - making it impossible for the advertisers to uniquely identify the user			2
@entity3 then converts the other information into a sequence of numbers and letters			0
for example , the information for an 18 - year - old who likes reading the @entity113 and lives in @entity114 becomes a string of numbers , along the lines of ' 145sjfor23455djj '			0
adverts are then matched to the appropriate series of characters , meaning private data is never directly shared			1
‘ we have 25 million small to medium - sized businesses around the world that use our free products to set up a page and use it to reach their customers			0
‘ so just as i can share with you if we 're friends on @entity3 , small businesses can reach their customers			2
’ the sixth most powerful woman in the world , according to @entity134 , said : ‘ we are in the middle of the fastest adoption of disruptive technology the world has ever seen			0
' the word ' online ' is becoming an old - fashioned word because we 're all going to be connected all the time			0
’ @entity2 also wrote and published @entity141 in last march , which advised women on how to be more confident and successful at work by becoming more involved and to face their fears			0
but she said there was still more to be done : ‘ despite all the progress women have made , men still have the great majority of the leadership positions in every business , in every industry , in every country in the world			0
' it 's really important that since women make up half the population , women start having half the seats at tables where decisions are made , and that 's not where we are today			0
' she said women thinking about doing something should ask themselves what they would do if they were not afraid and then do it .			0
