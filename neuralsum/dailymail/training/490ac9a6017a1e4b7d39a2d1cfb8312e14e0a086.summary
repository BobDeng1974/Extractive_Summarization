scientists have revealed a new species of horned dinosaur with a bizarre set of ' wings ' on its head			2
mercuriceratops gemini was approximately 6 meters ( 20 feet ) long and weighed more than 2 tonnes			1
it lived about 77 million years ago during the @entity8			1
mercuriceratops had a parrot - like beak and probably had two long brow horns above its eyes			1
it was a plant - eating dinosaur			2
it reached 6 meters ( 20 feet ) long and weighed more than 2 tons			1
it lived about 77 million years ago during the @entity8			1
each animal has a slightly different ' frill ' so they could identify each other			1
research describing the new species is published online in the journal @entity33 , and is based on fossils collected from @entity35 in the @entity36 and @entity37 , @entity38			2
@entity18 ( @entity39 + ceratops ) means ' @entity42 horned - face , ' referring to the wing - like ornamentation on its head that resembles the wings on the helmet of the @entity48 god , @entity42			0
the name “ gemini ” refers to the almost identical twin specimens found in north central @entity35 and the @entity52 , @entity53 , in @entity37 , @entity38			1

' @entity18 took a unique evolutionary path that shaped the large frill on the back of its skull into protruding wings like the decorative fins on classic 1950s cars			0
' it definitively would have stood out from the herd during the @entity8 , ' said lead author dr. @entity75 , curator of vertebrate paleontology at the @entity77			1
' @entity79 dinosaurs in @entity80 used their elaborate skull ornamentation to identify each other and to attract mates — not just for protection from predators			1
' the wing - like protrusions on the sides of its frill may have offered male @entity18 a competitive advantage in attracting mates			0
' ' the butterfly - shaped frill , or neck shield , of @entity18 is unlike anything we have seen before , ' said co-author dr. @entity96 , curator of vertebrate palaeontology at the @entity98			0
' @entity99 shows that evolution gave rise to much greater variation in horned dinosaur headgear than we had previously suspected			0
' quarry in @entity53 , @entity37 , @entity38 , where the @entity18 gemini skull fossils were discovered the new dinosaur is described from skull fragments from two individuals collected from the @entity110 of @entity35 and the @entity111 of @entity37			2
the @entity35 specimen was originally collected on private land and acquired by the @entity98			0
the @entity37 specimen was collected by @entity115 , a preparator in dr. @entity118 ’s lab at the @entity119			0
@entity11 ( center ) compared to horned dinosaurs @entity122 ( left ) and @entity123 ( right ) , also from the @entity111 of @entity37 , @entity38			0
' @entity115 showed me her specimen during one of my trips to @entity37 , ' said @entity75			0
' i instantly recognized it as being from the same type of dinosaur that the @entity98 had from @entity35			0
' ' this discovery of a previously unknown species in relatively well - studied rocks underscores that we still have many more new species of dinosaurs to left to find , ' said co-author dr. @entity137 , research associate at the @entity138 of @entity139			0

frilled areas may have been used to attract a mate and identify others in the herd
