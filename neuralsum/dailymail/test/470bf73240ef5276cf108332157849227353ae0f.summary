the size of @entity2 ’ gamble in paying an astonishing £ 11millon a game to retain their @entity5 tv rights has led to the company having to re-address their entire sports strategy			1
and overlord @entity8 addressed staff this week to present his way forward - ‘ @entity15 ’ - with the station needing to make considerable changes to afford their gigantic football bill			1
this will see @entity2 concentrate on their live rights in every sport while reducing the support programming and those leaving the network are not being automatically replaced			1
@entity2 will pay £ 11millon a game to broadcast @entity5 football for three years starting in 2016 @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 on @entity2 's @entity28 coverage of the @entity5 @entity8 , who prefers to speak off the cuff , was using a prepared script on this important occasion and one department asked for a copy to show @entity2 personnel who missed the meeting			1
but he declined to issue duplicates , telling his troops he did n’t want your sports agenda columnist to get hold of the text - such is the paranoia in @entity43			1
@entity2 claim the strategy talk - rather than plain cost cutting - was preparing the station for the varied demands of a multi-platform future where a @entity25 video on @entity2 ’s @entity51 channel can become more important than traditional programme making			1
the technical problems with the charter plane which forced the @entity56 team to stay overnight in @entity57 after the game were n’t the only flying concerns related to the @entity61 match			2
the @entity63 flight bringing in @entity65 ’s football pundits @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and the cream of @entity70 had to abort landing close to the ground because of the cross-winds meaning the plane was wrongly aligned with the runway approach			0
these same @entity76 cross-winds and another rather more serious runway direction miscalculation by the pilot in poor weather saw the plane carrying the great @entity82 side of 1949 crash into the @entity84 which stands on the hill overlooking the airport , killing all 31 on board			0
relationships between the @entity89 and the @entity90 - already at a low point over the switching of double loyalty rewards from away trips to @entity95 - will be further strained by the loud singing of songs in @entity57 that only bring embarrassment on @entity100 football			2
understandably the @entity89 are in no mood to act on their fans ’ complaints about ‘ two caps for @entity95 , you ’re having a laugh ’ , when the same travelling set of supporters still sing ‘ @entity111 ’ and ‘ where were you in @entity110 ’			1
it ’s also been noted that while senior members of the @entity115 are quick to speak out about loyalty issues , they are less talkative about those tasteless chants			0
@entity56 fans sang @entity120 songs during tuesday 's friendly draw with @entity61 at the @entity122 - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants it would never have happened under the fanatical reign of former @entity89 head of security @entity130 , now working for @entity132			2
but @entity56 manager @entity133 took himself off for a long walk around @entity57 in his @entity56 training gear to while away some of the time before kick - off			0
inevitably that meant good - humouredly running the gauntlet of @entity56 fans and their demands for photos , selfies and autographs			0
@entity144 not able to stop the @entity89 continue to micro-manage the supposedly free - for - all media interview mixed zone which players have to go through after matches			0
but for @entity56 , this means that even man of the moment @entity144 , who is always happy to chat to the media after club games , is n’t allowed to stop because the @entity89 decree who is going to speak			2
the @entity89 say they go to great efforts to prepare their young players for @entity56 media scrutiny , which includes a briefing by @entity160 , and it was decided that @entity144 would not do mixed zone duties			0
@entity56 's latest star @entity144 was recently micro-managed by the @entity89 to not speak in media mixed zones football agent @entity166 continues his search for ‘ peace of mind ’ by proving he was wrongly cut out of the £ 300,000 fee agency @entity171 received for the @entity173 transfer from @entity174 to @entity175 eight years ago			1
it means @entity166 is willing to commit to well over double that amount hiring top legal help for his private prosecutions against @entity173 , @entity175 chairman @entity181 , former boss @entity182 and others including retired agents @entity185 and @entity186			0
@entity173 's ( right ) transfer to @entity175 from @entity174 in 2007 earned agency @entity171 a fee of £ 300,000			0

@entity2 will be paying £ 11millon a game to broadcast games in 2016
three - year deal means @entity2 are re-addressing their entire sports strategy
‘ @entity198 ’ plan will see reduced programming support
