by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 28 august 2013 a fifteen - year - old girl was reduced to tears after receiving foul abuse from parents while refereeing an under - 10 's football match			1
after a strong challenge went unpunished towards the end of a fixture between @entity10 , who have links to @entity13 and are based at the club 's youth complex in @entity16 , and @entity18 's @entity17 , @entity6 was surrounded by raging parents who started swearing at and verbally abusing the teenager			1
football - mad @entity6 , who plays as well as officiates , revealed that her confidence has been shattered by the incident and that she has been left fearful of continuing to referee			1
foul play : @entity6 describes the abuse she received from parents while refereeing as ' frightening ' shock : @entity6 's father has revealed his anger at the treatment his daughter was subjected to ' i do n't think i said there was swearing as such , but he did definitely call me a disgrace , ' @entity6 told @entity35			1
there were a few parents saying things like ' silly little b * * * * ' , ' t * * * ' and things like that			1
' at the end of the day , it is a kids football match			2
they just want to play football , i just want to ref and it should n't be taken that seriously			2
hopefully , this will raise awareness of how much referee needs respect because people under - estimate how hard it is to be a referee until they actually take it up			2
' ' i 've had the best support possible from @entity57			2
we are currently working on it and have sent reports off			2
the people at the @entity57 are all behind me			2
they can concentrate a lot on protecting referees as well			2
' ' i think there was a @entity66 / @entity18 rivalry at the play			1
i had walked off by that stage , when the parents were having a snap at each other			1
there was an element of that rivalry there			1
@entity76 will now be the subject of an investigation by @entity79 and , if it finds against the club , the punishment is expected to be severe as @entity6 's young age makes this incident a breach of the safeguarding children code			1
it ’s sad but inevitable to hear her @entity88 speak of the advice he had given @entity6 , telling her to ‘ expect a little bit of criticism , after all she is a referee ’			1
the point is that the criticism and abuse of match officials is now so commonplace that it has become the accepted norm and all too often it goes unreported as local park refs take their lead from senior colleagues and ignore the abuse			2
‘ it comes with the territory ’ seems the oft trodden path			0
i manage an under 14 team and two seasons ago had to step in when an opposition parent harangued a young lady referee so much he made her cry – his team were allowed to play on and were merely warned as to their future @entity111 this case both teams were expelled from the tournament but all too often , no action is taken due to referees - understandably when alone and unprotected - decide that discretion is the better part of @entity120 referees have no such excuses ; they just choose to ignore the excesses of the modern footballer and that sets the template for the game			0
the game took place at @entity128 in @entity129 , during a tournament involving over 250 sides			0
both clubs were sides were immediately expelled from the competition			0
@entity17 chairman @entity135 told the @entity136 : ' we will be writing to the girl who was refereeing and her mother to apologise for what happened			1
apparently it was something and nothing that turned into a @entity18 / @entity66 thing with the two sets of parents			1
we will be carrying out our own internal review			0
' however , @entity148 , the coach of @entity10 , has denied that the incident revolved around a @entity66 / @entity18 rivalry			1
he told the @entity136 : ' there was no animosity between our parents and theirs and this was not a @entity66 / @entity18 thing as they claimed			1
' i noticed before the match that the parents of the kids on the other team were stood on the touchline when they should have been behind a white taped line as ours were			1
' i asked the referee for clarification and she said it was ok			0
as i walked off i got a few comments and one of their parents called me " petty "			1
' he added : ' there were a few comments from the other side and it got a bit heated but there was no aggression from either set of parents and we certainly did not swear at the referee			2
' she said the game was over and there was going to be penalties			0
i told her that she should have stopped it ( the game , after a foul earlier in the match ) but i was n’t having a go at her			0
' you could see she was upset and she ended up walking away			0
' @entity6 's father added : ' when she decided to go down this route , you expect a little bit of criticism - she 's a referee - so obviously we had talks about that			1
but on this scale , i 'd never imagined it , and certainly not in an under 9 competition			0
' not only should you pay respect to the referee but you have little children in football , coming up through the age groups			0
it is no example to set			0
the @entity57 spend a fortune on respect for referees and it has got to start at grassroots			0
' @entity215 pledged to investigate the incident , in a statement			0
@entity218 : @entity6 believes the @entity18 - @entity66 rivalry played its part in the incident it read : ' @entity215 has been made aware of the alleged incident from this weekend ’s game and is currently investigating the matter			1
' it would therefore be inappropriate for us to make any further comment regarding that specific case at this time			0
' the vast majority of football matches in @entity66 occur without incident			0
when discipline does occur , however , it is dealt with as per @entity234			0
' abuse of referees is always wholly unacceptable and where necessary @entity215 will continue to address poor behaviour with the use of sanctions , educational workshops and the @entity243 campaign			0
' @entity244 have contacted @entity13 but are yet to receive a comment at the time of publishing .			0

@entity250 pledge to write to @entity6 and apologise
but @entity253 coach denies swearing and rivalry with other parents
