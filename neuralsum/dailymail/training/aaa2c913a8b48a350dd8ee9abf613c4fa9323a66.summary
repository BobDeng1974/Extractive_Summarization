@entity0 , 58 , from @entity1 , suffered excruciating headaches @entity0 's headaches were so excruciating that they left her face partly paralysed and she could barely talk			1
during particularly bad attacks , her eyelids drooped and her jaw dropped			0
' i 've suffered from headaches all my life , ' says @entity0 , 58 , a retired supermarket cashier from @entity1 in @entity11			1
' even as a baby my mum told me i used to cradle my head and cry uncontrollably			0
as soon as i was old enough , about three years old , i was able to tell her i had headaches on the left side of my head			1
she took me to scores of doctors but they did n't know what was causing the pain			1
' for years @entity0 depended on strong painkillers , which she ' popped like @entity24 ' , taking up to six a day despite her concerns about any long - term damage			1
' i could never accept invites to social events because i would n't know how i 'd be feeling			2
i 'd usually hide in bed when my headache was really bad , ' recalls the grandmother - of - three			1
but for the past two years @entity0 has n't needed headache pills - instead she 's kept the pain at bay with a device that delivers a mild electric current into her neck			1
the portable hand - held device , called @entity39 , sends small electric pulses into the vagus nerve , which runs from the brain to the abdomen and relays messages to and from the heart , lungs and digestive system			1
these messages activate chemical neurotransmitters in the brain			0
there are different kinds of messengers and one theory is that people who suffer from severe frequent headaches may produce too many neurotransmitters and as a result , sensations that are not normally painful are misinterpreted by the brain , causing headaches			0
the @entity39 is thought to reduce levels of certain neurotransmitters			2
it has been developed to relieve migraines as well as cluster headaches ( brief but extremely painful and debilitating headaches that can recur up to several times a day , for weeks or months )			0
@entity0 was prescribed the @entity65 by her specialist , professor @entity67 , a neurologist , and dr @entity69 , a headache specialist , both at @entity71 , @entity72			1
@entity39 sends small electric pulses into the vagus nerve , which runs from the brain to the abdomen professor @entity67 's been leading research into the safety and efficacy of the device for different types of headaches since 2012 - in a year - long pilot clinical trial , 15 out of 19 cluster headache patients reported an overall improvement in pain levels and frequency of attacks of more than 50 per cent after regularly using @entity65			1
the findings were presented at the @entity90 in @entity91 in september and larger studies are under way			0
@entity0 was initially referred to professor @entity67 in 2004			2
before seeing him , she 'd been given many different tablets for her headaches , including medicines used for depression ( some , such as lithium , can sometimes control pain ) , as well as epilepsy drugs ( which can suppress the over-activity in the brain involved in headaches )			2
but these only dulled her pain and wore off after a few hours			0
she 'd also been prescribed injections of morphine , and anti-inflammatory medications such as steroids and diclofenac , which are used as painkillers for certain conditions including migraines			0
' i feared one day my organs would just pack up , i was having so much heavy - duty medication , ' says @entity0			1
' doctors told me to try to cut down the amount because of the long - term side - effects steroids can cause , such as osteoporosis			0
' when she first saw professor @entity67 he ran tests that showed that she was suffering from @entity125 , a rare type of headache that causes constant pain			2
he prescribed indomethacin , a drug known to help with these headaches			0
but while her headaches lifted , after a few weeks she had to stop taking the pills due to severe side - effects , including a stomach ulcer			1
@entity0 then had an electronic device surgically implanted into her neck that delivered electrical stimulation to the brain through the occipital nerve , which runs from the base of the skull to the spine , and conducts pain			1
the device worked for two years until the batteries ran out ( they were n't replaced as she was testing it as part of a clinical trial ) - sending @entity0 into despair once more			1
then in 2012 professor @entity67 prescribed the @entity39			2
the technology was originally developed to treat conditions such as epilepsy , but then patients reported it also eased their headaches			0
' it is n't a cure but @entity39 works miracles , ' says @entity0 to use the device , a conductive gel is applied to the surfaces of the device and it is placed on the neck			1
the treatment , which takes about two minutes , produces a tingling or pricking feeling			0
potential side - effects , although rare , include hoarseness , shortness of breath , or a change in voice while the treatment is being given ( because of the effect on the vagus nerve )			0
however , these are usually temporary and stop when two minutes are up			0
@entity0 says the treatment made a significant difference within three months , reducing the severity and frequency of her headaches			1
she now uses @entity65 as a preventative measure three times a day			0
' i still have a constant low - level headache , but it is nothing compared with the hell i used to experience , ' she says , adding that she has not needed medication for two years			1
' @entity187 has transformed my life			0
in the past my headaches were so bad i 'd rather give birth three times than suffer from one			2
it is n't a cure but @entity39 works miracles			1
i now love entertaining my three grandchildren , which i could n't do before			0
' the @entity39 is not suitable for patients with a pacemaker or hearing aid implant , as it emits a mild electrical current			1
it should also not be used by people who are diagnosed with narrowing of the arteries in the neck ( carotid atherosclerosis ) or those who have had surgery to cut the vagus nerve in their neck			0
the device has been licensed for treatment of migraines and cluster headaches , and while the @entity215 ( @entity215 ) is considering approving funding , it is only available on the @entity217 for patients with exceptional circumstances			2
@entity187 is available privately , but at about Â£ 300 a month , it is not cheap ( the device needs to be replaced monthly when the batteries run out though the manufacturer is working on a rechargeable device )			0
dr @entity225 , a consultant neurologist at @entity226 , @entity72 , said : ' for many patients , non-invasive neurostimulation offers an exciting and acceptable alternative to standard painkillers			0
early results of trials with the @entity39 are promising , and further studies are eagerly awaited			2
' patients interested in using the device can email dr @entity69 , a headache specialist at @entity71 , @entity72 , at h.marin@nhs.net .			2
