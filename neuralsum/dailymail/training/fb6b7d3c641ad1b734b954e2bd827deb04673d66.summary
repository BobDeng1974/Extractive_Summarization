@entity1 pilot @entity0 der @entity2 was killed when his bomber crashed into the shore near @entity5 a campaign has been launched to move the bodies of two @entity1 pilots to a @entity10 war cemetery after their single , unmarked grave was discovered 72 years on			1
the airmen were buried in the same grave in a @entity15 churchyard after their two bombers were shot down during a raid on @entity18 in august 1940			1
three days later another @entity10 bomber crashed in the area , resulting in the remains of four men to be buried in one coffin on top of the other two men			1
more than 20 years later the @entity26 had the remains of all its servicemen killed in @entity29 in @entity30 exhumed , and interred at the @entity31 , in @entity32			1
but the two airmen - @entity0 der @entity2 and @entity34 - were left behind as it was not realised their coffins lay underneath the top one			1
they have remained in the unmarked grave in @entity5 cemetery ever since			0
two local historians have now unravelled the macabre mystery and have identified the unknown airmen through their identity disc numbers			2
after realising their names were not on the @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 researched local records and archives and were able to pinpoint them to ' @entity51 ' at @entity5			0
now the family of @entity2 , the two historians and the @entity54 are calling on the authorities to move the bodies to @entity31			2
mr @entity46 said : ' it is a rather bizarre and macabre mystery			0
' in 1962 the exhumation team did not realise the graves of another two men lay underneath			0
' although the local records , which still exist today , show 11 @entity10 airmen were buried at @entity5 in august 1940 , only nine were relocated to @entity31			1
' @entity5 council should have informed the @entity10 about the burials of these two men after the war but did n't			1
' as a result the two men have remained forgotten and unidentified in a scruffy grave that is just a patch of grass with no headstone on			0
@entity72 and his fellow airman @entity34 were buried in this plot at a churchyard in @entity5 , but the coffins of other @entity10 servicemen were placed on top so when the bodies were exhumed 20 years later they were left behind ' while there is an argument for letting the men rest in peace where they were originally buried it would be fitting for them to join their fallen comrades at @entity31 and be added to the official roll of honour there			1
' but it is down to the @entity26 to organise and finance			0
' historian and author mr @entity47 said : ' i researched this story , with @entity46 , for my book ' finding the @entity94 '			0
' i would be happy to kick - start a fund to help get these men properly buried under named headstones at the @entity31			2
' @entity98 , the nephew of @entity2 der @entity72 , said : ' myself and my two brothers want to move his grave from @entity5 to @entity31			0
' in august 1940 , @entity29 faced the real prospect of invasion from the @entity103			2
during the height of the @entity29 @entity105 sent wave and wave of bombers to attack strategic military targets across south east of @entity110			0
on august 13 a squadron of @entity112 bombers found themselves on a doomed raid as a communication error meant they had no fighter escorts			2
downed : the wreckage of @entity118 's crashed bomber on @entity5 beach after it was shot down during a raid on @entity18 in august 1940 blitz raid : the airmen 's @entity112 bomber was one of five shot down by @entity125 on august 13 , 1940 @entity0 @entity34 's body is carried away from the mudflats near @entity128 , @entity5			1
he had bailed out but was killed after his parachute failed to open after bombing coastal targets the planes came under fierce attack by @entity125 , resulting in five of them being shot down			1
@entity134 was killed after he bailed out of his plane over @entity128 , near @entity5 , and his parachute failed to open			0
the body of @entity2 was washed up at @entity5 after his crashed on the shoreline there			0
from their identity numbers , they were recorded as being buried at @entity5 on august 17 in the deep grave			2
the @entity5 branch of the @entity54 is in contact with the @entity10 embassy in @entity18 with a view of getting the process of relocation started			1
it is thought a fee of about 3,000 pounds will be required to cover the cost of the exhumation and reburial .			0

@entity157 airmen 's @entity155 bomber was shot down by @entity125 over @entity15 during a @entity159 raid in 1940
coffins of four other @entity10 servicemen were buried on top of theirs so when the bodies were exhumed 20 years later they were left behind
