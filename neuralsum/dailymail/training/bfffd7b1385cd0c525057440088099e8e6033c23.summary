the @entity6 have invaded @entity7 - or the @entity7 coast at any rate			1
figures from @entity11 show that more than half a million @entity6 are enjoying a spot of our glorious @entity7 weather in seaside towns including @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			2
@entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 ! @entity6 tourists are flocking to seaside destinations such as @entity24 in @entity25 to get a touch of the bracing @entity7 sea air this means more @entity6 are choosing to holiday along the @entity7 's 7,723 - mile coastline than visitors from any other nation			1
latest figures put our @entity34 neighbours in only second place to the @entity37 in terms of visits to the @entity7 , with 2,989 @entity6 coming to @entity7 between april 2011 and march 2012 compared with 3,820 people from @entity37			1
but yesterday 's figures show those @entity6 who do come here are making a beeline for the beach , with 523,000 - 18 per cent of those coming to @entity7 - choosing coastal destinations last year			1
by contrast , only 4,000 ( 13 per cent ) of @entity37 visitors and just 355,000 ( 12 per cent ) of @entity47 chose the @entity7 as seaside destination			2
only three per cent of tourists from sunnier climes such as @entity52 picked the @entity7 seaside			0
@entity54 and new : sports and @entity7 's mix of history and modern culture were picked by foreign visitors as the main reasons for coming to the @entity7 @entity61 rosbifs : @entity7 culinary classics such as the traditional sunday roast were not so popular amongst holiday makers from outside the @entity7 the findings come from a report into what the tourist authority can do to boost visits to @entity7 's coastline			0
a peculiarly @entity72 drive to colonise our sun loungers may not be the only reason they are drawn to the coast			0
' @entity79 sagas ' : the romantic @entity25 - based novels of @entity81 such as @entity82 were the basis of a @entity6 tv series @entity11 listed @entity25 , along with @entity85 , as the most popular destination for @entity6 tourists - @entity25 being the location of writer @entity81 's novels , which formed the basis of an 89 - part tv series in @entity6			1
the show gained a popularity akin to that of @entity94 , with as many as seven million viewers tuning into them on sunday nights			0
it 's perhaps not surprising , then , that @entity25 and @entity99 alone saw a 14 per cent increase in visits from @entity6 tourists last year - many taking part in @entity81 - themed tours around the @entity104			1
this was despite the fact that the total number of @entity6 visiting the @entity7 rose by just two per cent - while visitors from other countries such as the @entity47 , @entity110 and @entity111 fell			1
and @entity6 remained stubbornly budget - driven while on holiday over here , their percentage spend rising by just one per cent between last year and 2011 - compared with a 34 per cent spending increase from @entity37 visitors			2
a spokesman from @entity11 said : ' over the past six years the coastal counties of @entity85 and @entity25 have attracted more than 80,000 @entity6 holidaymakers a year , significantly more than those countries attract from all other major markets			0
' this tends to indicate that the possibility for coastal walks exerts a strong influence on where @entity6 choose to holiday in @entity7			0
' @entity126 : the stereotype of the @entity6 tourist laying their towel out to ' book ' a beach spot could be becoming a common @entity134 sight more than 35million visitors a year ( 12 per cent ) took to the @entity7 's coastline , the spokesman said			1
however , the ' beautiful coastline ' came last in a list of reasons for visiting - along with @entity7 food - according to questionnaire - based research			2
the top reason given for visiting was our ' rich sporting offer ' , followed by music festivals , heritage , the mixture of ' old and new ' and the @entity7 countryside .			0

more @entity6 choosing to visit @entity7 coast than any other nation .
@entity6 only second to @entity37 in total @entity7 visits
