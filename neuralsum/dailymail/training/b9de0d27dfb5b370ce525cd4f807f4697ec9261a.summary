by @entity0 published : 15:02 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 15:02 est , 9 september 2013 a compound found in tea brewed from tree bark could lead the way in the fight to eradicate @entity7 , researchers claim			1
scientists have found a way to isolate the chemical , prostratin and synthesise it so it is 100 times as potent , the meeting of the @entity9 was told			1
the bark of the mamala tree , which contains prostratin , has been used by tribal healers in @entity20 to treat patients with hepatitis			2
a compound found in tea brewed from tree bark of the mamala tree , pictured , could lead the way in the fight to eradicate @entity7 , researchers claim the same technique could be used on naturally occurring drug candidates , some found in sea creatures , leading to new treatments for cancer and @entity35 ’s , said dr @entity36 , of @entity37			1
dr @entity36 said his research represents a ‘ fundamentally new approach to some of the most serious unmet health challenges of our time '			0
he led a team which developed a process to distill prostratin from the bark of the @entity20 mamala tree and was praised by native healers as remedy for hepatitis			0
scientists isolated prostratin as the active ingredient and realised its potential as an anti-viral drug			1
dr @entity36 said : ' we now have made synthetic variants of prostratin , called analogs , that are 100 times more potent than the natural product			1
' that ’s part of the basis for our approach to advancing potentially transformative treatments for @entity7 , alzheimer ’s disease and resistant cancer			2
the new compounds have shown promise for both preventing the hiv virus ( pictured ) from infecting human cells and awakening dormant @entity70 viruses that are hiding inside human latently infected cells ' the mamala tree did not start making prostratin millions of years ago to treat a disease that appeared in the 20th century			2
' the same is true for other substances that occur naturally in plants and animals			0
but we now have the tools to read nature ’s library and use the lessons learned there to design , make and study new molecules that address unmet medical needs			0
' this ‘ function - oriented ’ approach seeks to identify useful parts of molecules and then , based on this knowledge , to design new and more readily synthesised molecules that work better or work in totally new ways			0
' this is a well - validated strategy , perhaps best exemplified by the emergence of modern aviation from knowledge of how birds fly			0
' the new compounds have shown promise for both preventing @entity70 from infecting human cells and awakening dormant @entity70 viruses that are hiding inside human latently infected cells			0
the @entity37 research team have used the same approach to synthesis bryostatin , a substance that occurs naturally in sea creatures called bryozoans ( pictured ) latent @entity70 cell reservoirs are untouchable by today ’s antiviral medicines which reduce active virus levels in patients ’ blood and keep them healthy			1
but when patients stop the medication , the hibernating @entity70 in reservoirs awakens to resupply active virus			0
@entity117 flushes out dormant hiv cells so that antiviral drugs can attack and hopefully eradicate the @entity70 from the body			1
in essence , said dr @entity36 , if one wants to eliminate a weed , one needs to get rid of its roots			0
his team used the same approach to synthesis bryostatin , a substance that occurs naturally in sea creatures called bryozoans			1
' @entity131 has shown great promise in laboratory experiments as the basis for development of potentially transformative medicines for cancer , alzheimer ’s disease and the eradication of hiv / aids , ' he said			2
the research team is currently also focusing on bryostatin and designed analogs for their potential use in boosting memory in @entity35 's patients ' however , its limited supply from natural sources has slowed research , and as with prostratin , it was not evolved in nature for modern therapeutic use			1
' we have overcome both the supply and performance barriers by designing simpler and thus more readily synthesised analogs of bryostatin - over 100 of them so far			2
' when tested in various assays related to hiv / aids eradication , these analogs are up to 1,000-fold more potent in flushing @entity70 out of its hiding places than prostratin			2
' much needs to be done , but we are on a promising trajectory			0
' the research team is currently also focusing on bryostatin and designed analogs for their potential use in boosting memory in @entity35 ’s patients			1
the compound is known to improve learning and memory in laboratory rats and appears to cause formation of new connections in the brain that are associated with learning and memory .			0

compound in prostratin has been isolated making it 100 more more potent
synthetic variants of prostratin , called analogs , are powerful antiviral drugs
scientists hope to use the same technique to get to use naturally occurring drugs , some found in sea creatures , to treat cancer and @entity35 ’s
