' this is being escalated through to the directors of @entity43 and @entity25 and the @entity44			0
' please do not give the staff grief ; this will only lead to us removing fish and chips completely			1
' everyone has a right to work in a none abusive environment			0
' commercial partners @entity55 , @entity7 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 will be the only branded products sold at the games			0
