by @entity1 reporter published : 11:21 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 21 august 2013 deep within the woods of @entity4 , a secret homeless community has left the city and taken to the trees to set up home			2
but rather than simply eschewing the rat race , the group - many of whom are mentally ill , jobless and battling addiction - claim they have been left with no other choice			1
the community in @entity17 , @entity4 , has been given the eerie title locally as the ' @entity19 ' after being forced to set up camp there - some for as long as 20 years - because @entity23 does not offer homeless shelters			1
@entity17 , @entity4 , where the homeless and down on their luck have become known as the ' @entity19 ' after taking to the trees the community in @entity17 , @entity4 , has been given the eerie title locally as the ' @entity19 ' after being forced to set up camp there a reporter for @entity31 had to first gain the people 's trust before they would take her on a tour of their community among the trees reporter @entity37 , from @entity38 , was told about the so called tent city by volunteers at the @entity41 , which provides food and services for the homeless in the woods			1
it has been reported that it costs taxpayers around $ 14,480 per year to care for a single homeless person			0
many of those living in the woods are alcoholics who said they could not afford to pay rent and live on their own and so were ' forced to be there '			2
but @entity41 volunteer @entity54 said it far from a countryside idyll , adding : ' no young person should have to see what is going on there			0
' many of them told her that while they were still able to claim state benefits , they were not enough to afford low income housing , and so they had no other choice but to sleep rough some of the rough sleepers have been in the woods for as long as 20 years - because @entity23 does not offer homeless shelters the centre helps the group with food and occasional day landscaping jobs , but as yet there has been no permanent solution			1
the township has taken down most of the tents , although there is no other shelter provided for them			0
another of the caring centre workers said that one of the homeless wood dwellers had become seriously ill after suffering a tick bite			2
but the cost of his treatment has fallen on the taxpayer to bear			0
she added : ' the cost of getting them into a shelter and giving them services would have been so much cheaper and cost effective , and then he could have got @entity95 and started paying taxes back into the system			0

community in @entity17 , @entity4 , has been given the eerie title locally
many have been there for years and are mentally ill , jobless and addicts
they say they **'re** there because @entity23 does *n't* offer shelters
while they **'re** still on state benefits it is not enough to afford housing
