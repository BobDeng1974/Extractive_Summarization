a new model for @entity2 progression shows that it spreads in a similar way to some computer ' worms '			1
@entity2 specialists and network security experts at @entity8 ( @entity8 ) made the disovery after creating a simulation of how the virus spreads they worked together to build a model for this ' hybrid spreading ' which accurately predicted patients ' progression from @entity2 to @entity17 in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off @entity17			1
as @entity2 progresses , it reduces the number of active t - cells in the body until the immune system can not function correctly , a state known as ' acquired immune deficiency syndrome ' or @entity17			1
current @entity42 guidelines , which the @entity44 government follows , recommend only beginning hiv treatment when the number of t - cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level			0
however , the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent @entity17 from developing in the long term			1
the teams noticed that the spread of @entity2 through the body using two methods - via the bloodstream and directly between cells - was similar to how some computer worms spread through both the internet and local networks respectively to infect as many computers as possible			1
the model was inspired by similarities between @entity2 and computer worms such as the highly damaging ' @entity67 ' worm , first detected in 2008 , which has infected military and police computer networks across @entity71 and is still active today			1
lead author @entity72 , of @entity8 , said : ' @entity2 and @entity67 have a lot in common			1
' they both use hybrid spreading mechanisms , persist for a very long time and are incredibly difficult to eradicate			0
' our model enables us to explain these important properties and to predict the infection process			0
' @entity72 's supervisor co-author dr @entity83 said : ' although the cybersecurity community organised an unprecedented collaboration to tackle @entity67 , they still failed to eliminate @entity67 from the @entity86			0
' @entity2 researchers face a similar problem			0
we hope that our new understanding of hybrid epidemics will help us to fight against @entity67 and @entity2			2
' detailed sample data from 17 @entity2 patients from @entity93 were used to verify the model , showing that hybrid spreading provides the best explanation for @entity2 progression and highlighting the benefits of early treatment			1
@entity2 infects @entity29 + t - cells , which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases			0
as @entity2 progresses , it reduces the number of active t - cells in the body until the immune system can not function correctly , a state known as ' acquired immune deficiency syndrome ' or @entity17			2
current @entity42 guidelines , which the @entity44 government follows , recommend only beginning hiv treatment when the number of t - cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level			0
however , the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent @entity17 from developing in the long term			2
co-senior author professor @entity121 , of @entity8 , said : ' the number of @entity2 cells in the bloodstream is always relatively low , and our model shows that @entity2 spread through the bloodstream alone would not be enough to cause @entity17			1
the model was inspired by similarities between @entity2 and computer worms such as the highly damaging ' @entity67 ' worm , first detected in 2008 , which has infected military and police computer networks across @entity71 and is still active today			1
' it is likely that when @entity2 gains a foothold somewhere with a high t - cell population , such as the gut , it uses a cell - to - cell transfer mechanism to efficiently spread directly between them			0
as such , if @entity2 has already spread to an area rich in t - cells by the time treatment begins , preventing its spread through the bloodstream will not stop @entity17			1
' our model suggests that completely blocking cell - to - cell transfer would prevent progression to @entity17 , highlighting the need to develop new treatments			2
' laboratory research , led by co-senior author dr @entity153 , has previously shown that some drugs are better than others at stopping @entity2 from spreading directly between cells			0
however , it 's not possible to directly measure cell - to - cell spread in patients because it takes place inside internal organs			0
dr @entity153 said : ' with this new model , we should be able to assess the effectiveness of drugs against different modes of @entity2 spread in real patients			2
' this could prove invaluable when interpreting the results of drug trials to understand what works and why			0
using computer models to understand processes that we can not directly observe is common in the physical sciences and supports many fundamental theories			0
' our model provides strong evidence that cell - to - cell spread is an important part of @entity2 spread , and we hope to show this directly in future animal studies			2

new model accurately predicted patients ' progression from @entity2 to @entity17
inspired by similarities between @entity2 and computer worms such as the highly damaging ' @entity67 ' worm , first detected in 2008
model found early treatment is key to staving off @entity17
