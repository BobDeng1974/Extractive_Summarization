@entity1 departments across @entity2 are ' near breaking point ' experts have today warned , as they called for an end to the fixation with the four - hour waiting target			1
a new report by the @entity9 said an ' undue ' focus on the national target can ' distort ' behaviour inside hospitals ' in ways that are not in the interests of patients or staff '			1
focus on the target can mean a significant amount of time is spent by staff reporting up the chain to those who commission healthcare , and regulators , with a potentially detrimental impact on the quality of care			2
the think tank 's critique what 's behind the @entity32 ' ? comes as @entity2 reveals emergency departments have not achieved the benchmark in @entity2 since july 2013			1
it comes as the latest figures , published today , show performance is getting worse			1
in the week ending march 1 , 91 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in @entity1 before being discharged or admitted to a hospital ward - short of the 95 per cent target			1
the @entity9 think tank today warned @entity1 departments across @entity2 are ' near breaking point ' , as they called for an end to the fixation with the four - hour waiting target it marks a slight fall from the previous week , when performance was 92 per cent			1
but authors of the @entity9 report argue that while the four - hour target has ' played an important part in improving patients ' experiences ' , it is just one part of a complex system of urgent care			1
the report argues a set of ' richer performance indicators ' should be considered alongside the weekly waiting time performance figures			1
@entity63 , chief executive of the @entity9 , and the report 's co-author , warned : ' @entity2 's @entity1 system is near crisis			1
' with the financial squeeze set to continue , there is no relief in sight if we keep up the current approach			0
' we need to rethink our assumptions as many of the " magic bullet " solutions suggested miss the point			0
' it 's not about more people turning up , but about a system with a squeeze on hospital space and staff , which needs to get better at discharging people safely and on time			0
' every minute of every day , an average of 40 patients arrive at emergency departments in @entity2			2
the speed with which people move through @entity1 ' has come to be regarded as a sentinel marker of the health care system '			0
the chair of the @entity96 , dr @entity97 , agreed , adding the four - hour wait has become ' disproportionate '			1
responding to the @entity9 briefing , he said : ' doctors want to treat patients on the basis of their individual need , rather than an arbitrary target			1
' moving away from a system that prioritises targets above all else to one which takes a wider view of how services are performing would improve the quality of patient care by preventing rushed admissions , or leaving those most in need waiting longer for treatment			0
95 per cent – the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in @entity1 before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital			1
92 per cent – average performance against the four - hour target by major @entity1 departments in 2014			1
three hours 43 minutes – the average time spent in @entity1 by a patient who is admitted to hospital after leaving @entity1			1
two hours 17 minutes – the average time spent in @entity1 by a patient who is sent home after leaving @entity1			1
more than one hour , four minutes – how much longer on average a patient over the age of 75 spends in @entity1 compared with those aged under 75			2
' by fixating on one narrow measurement , we risk focusing on the symptoms rather than the causes of rising pressure on @entity138 , which are linked to wider pressures across the @entity2 and social care sector			0
' cuts to social care mean hospitals have become a holding place for many older patients who ca n’t be discharged because there is simply nowhere for them to go			0
' this ‘ exit block ’ leads to bed shortages and patients waiting for hours on trolleys to be admitted			2
outside of hospitals investment in general practice is declining while demand is on the rise and more care is moved into the community - this simply is n’t sustainable			0
' we can only get to grips with pressure on @entity138 if we look at health and social care in the round , and ensure every part of the system is fully resourced and working well			0
' focus on @entity1 performance has intensified since the start of the year , as ' unprecedented ' winter pressures saw medics face a worsening situation			1
in january figures revealed @entity1 waiting times had plummeted to the lowest level in a decade			1
but the authors of the @entity9 report point out @entity1 is only part of a broader urgent care system			1
gp practices , out - of - hours services and the telephone service @entity2 111 all have key parts to play			2
the four - hour target counts the patients who spend a total of less than 240 minutes between arrival and leaving the department , having been either discharged or admitted to an inpatient bed in another part of the hospital			1
the authors said : ' the target has played an important part in improving patients ' experiences of care at @entity1			2
' before the target was introduced , 12 - hour waits were not uncommon			1
' when the benchmark was first introduced in 2004 , performance began to rise			0
in 2005 - 06 the target , then of seeing 98 per cent of patients within four hours , was met for the first time			1
in 2010 , the expectation was relaxed slightly , with the target lowered to 95 per cent of patients who should be treated and discharged or admitted within four hours			0
the report notes a range of pressures placed on @entity1 departments , but states the most significant issue ' is not the numbers of people presenting at @entity1 , but the ability to discharge patients safely and quickly from the hospital as a whole ' the pressure on the urgent care system is caused by high bed occupancy rates , tight resources and staff facing increasing strain , the report states			2
' there is no doubt that the system is near breaking point , ' they wrote			2
but there are other signs of the impending crisis , which will be accelerated by the ' continued financial squeeze '			2
the number of patients waiting on trolleys for more than four hours before being admitted to hospital has almost trebled , and delayed ambulance handovers at the doors of @entity1 have risen by more than 70 per cent			1
the think tank highlight the latest problems in @entity1 ' are part of a well - established decline since 2012 '			2
but they argue the picture is not as straightforward			0
@entity1 ‘ waiting ’ time the length of time a patient spends in the @entity1 department between being seen by @entity1 staff and either being admitted or discharged			2
unlike other @entity2 waiting times , this is not the length of time a person waits before they are treated			2
attendance any visit to @entity1 , whether it results in an admission or discharge			0
the average cost to the @entity2 is £ 124 per attendance			0
admission what happens to a patient who is transferred from @entity1 into another ward within the hospital for further treatment			0
the average cost to the @entity2 : £ 1,657 per admission			0
discharge what happens when a patient leaves @entity1 to go either home or to an outpatient clinic			0
traditional arguments have blamed the pressure on @entity1 with a rising tide of patients arriving at the doors of emergency departments			0
the report however , noted ' attendance has not risen much beyond what we would expect because of population change '			0
furthermore fingers have been pointed at the impact of the @entity2 phone line , cuts to social care and changes to the gp contract in 2004 , which gave family doctors the option to opt out of providing out - of - hours care			2
instead , the most significant issue facing @entity1 units across the country ' is not the numbers of people presenting at @entity1 , but the ability to discharge patients safely and quickly from the hospital as a whole '			1
that , the authors argue , is stemming the flow of patients through the hospital system from the front door back to their homes , or rehabilitation in the community			0
the briefing recommends that many answers to the current situation already exist			0
the authors recommend policy makers should take a longer - term and broader view of performance in @entity1 , introducing a more complex set of indicators to sit alongside the four - hour waiting target			1
' the complexity of the system and the highly politicised nature of the @entity1 have impeded progress , ' the authors said			0
' problems will not be solved if policy - makers , political leaders and regulators continue to micro-manage @entity1			0
' with change so urgently needed , it is imperative that there is a cross-party consensus on how to move forward and that action is not postponed or delayed for political reasons			0
' a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' this report makes some important suggestions about how the @entity2 could respond to winter pressures			0
' we are already undertaking a number of the actions that the @entity9 suggest - for example improving access to care outside hospitals , encouraging local health leaders to identify where to focus investment and using a richer range of different data indicators so we better understand how pressures are affecting different parts of the system			1
' we also recognise the need for more fundamental change , so we welcome contributions such as this that will help us to identify how we can work more efficiently and drive up standards of care across the country			0

@entity9 report warns @entity1 units in @entity2 are ' near breaking point '
the what 's behind the @entity32 ' ? briefing says ' undue ' focus has been placed on the four - hour waiting time target
argues it ' distorts ' behaviour ' in ways not in the interest of patients '
report reveals four - hour target was last achieved in @entity2 in july 2013
today 's weekly figures show 91 *%* of patients seen within four hours
think tank argues target is ' essential ' but must be considered alongside a ' richer set of performance indicators ' to ward off the impending crisis
