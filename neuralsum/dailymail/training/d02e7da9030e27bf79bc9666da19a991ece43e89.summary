by @entity0 last updated at 6:44 pm on 7th february 2012 the latest test version of @entity4 's upcoming @entity3 software is missing one crucial button - the @entity6 button and menu , an iconic part of @entity4 's operating system since it was introduced in @entity10			1
the button evolved to become the operating system 's ' launchpad ' , offering access to software , files and search functions			2
earlier test versions of @entity3 had flattened the recognisable ' orb ' - but the new build removes it altogether , according to leaked screenshots from tech site @entity23			2
@entity4 has not announced a release date for the new operating system , built to work with touchscreens as well as on conventional pcs , but it 's widely expected to release in the second half of this year			0
the leaked screenshots are from a preview version of the upcoming @entity3 , and show that @entity4 has removed the iconic @entity6 button @entity33 's start button : the button was first introduced in @entity10 , and evolved to become the ' launchpad ' for applications , access to the hard drive and search functions ' @entity41 not though , the start button functionality is n't as dead as it seems , ' reports the @entity23			1
although the button itself might be absent , the functions are still there , just accessed via a ' hot corner ' designed to work equally well with touchscreens or computer mice			1
' we have confirmed with sources close to @entity4 's @entity3 development that a hot corner has replaced the start button orb , ' says the @entity23			1
' a thumbnail - like user interface will appear in @entity56 or desktop mode , providing a consistent way to access the @entity60 desktop and @entity61 in @entity3 regardless of touch or mouse input @entity3 is a radical reinvention of @entity4 's operating system			0
the operating system is built to operate on tablets as well as pcs , and looks more like the @entity69 operating system - with a tile - based ' start ' screen akin to the menus of apps offered in smartphone operating systems			0
share and share again : @entity74 , the photo operating system , is optimised for use with touchscreens as well as conventional pcs navigation is done by swiping a finger across a touchscreen - although you can also use a mouse or even the direction keys			0
the system will also be built to rely heavily on ' cloud ' information storage , with a @entity89 login used to access some features , and heavy integration with online storage services such as @entity4 's @entity93 .			0
