convinced ! ' so 28 of the greatest tweeters on the internet , with a collective following of 12 million , have begged and bribed their followers to join their # twittermillion teams			1
' to join their team , they just need to think of something to raise money for comic relief , to the tune of £ 50 ... or more ! ' the competitive nature of the team captains is such that they are competing hard to outdo each other - and offering bribes to their followers to join their team			1

some of the tweets for # twittermillion ' @entity66 is being sponsored to cook for her husband - she last did it in 2004 and he has begged her to reconsider , but she 's doing it for @entity4 so he will just have to suffer			1
' one of my team is having a drinking competition during our tv show on friday - where she drinks a shot every time a track by @entity155 comes on ... she 's going to be legless , and we 'll make a fortune			0
' we have sponsored silences , sponsored pregnancies , cake sales , jewellery sales , massage sales , oddjob sales - and today a man joined a # twittermillion team saying that since he is severely disabled and the only thing he could do would be togive up swearing ... so he 's doing that ! ' the competition between the team captains , the extravagance of the bribes for team members , and the brilliance of the feats being undertaken to raise money have all taken my breath away			1
' i have no more breath now , it 's all gone , and we have raised thousands ! no figures yet as we do n't want to demoralise @entity179 ( who has raised £ 20 and has two team members ) , but these tweeters have become alchemists and turned twitter into gold			0
