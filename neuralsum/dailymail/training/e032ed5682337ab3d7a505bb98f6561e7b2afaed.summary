by @entity0 published : 07:37 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 10:01 est , 3 june 2013 @entity1 have got to be the freshest new band on @entity4 's heavy metal scene - just do n't ask to hear their early work ... they have n't written it all yet			0
that 's because guitarist @entity10 , drummer @entity11 and bassist @entity12 are all in the sixth grade			1
but despite their tender years , the trio , from @entity16 's @entity15 , are already better versed than most on the fine art of head - banging and have taken the city by storm			2
unlocking the truth : guitarist @entity10 ( right ) , drummer @entity11 ( centre ) and bassist @entity12 ( left ) are all in the sixth grade founding members : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) have known each other since birth ... ... but @entity12 ( left ) came a little late on the scene - he met them in daycare watch more unlocking the truth videos here			2
indeed , their face - melting guitar riffs , killer drum solos and pounding basslines can often be heard reverberating through @entity38 - their favourite busking patch - outside of school hours , of course			2
and it 's little wonder they combine so well given that they 've been together since day one ... literally			0
that is to say , founding members @entity10 , now 11 , and @entity11 , ten , have known each other since birth but @entity12 , ten , came a little late on the scene			2
he met them in daycare			0
hard rockers : but just like many a hard - core metal band , in order to rock hard , these boys like to drink hard , keeping their energy up on stage by swilling mug after mug of hot chocolate life of vice : their other vices are pizza and @entity69 food while their ' signature candy ' is mint @entity71 instrumental : they currently do n't have a lead singer since they sacked the last one because ' he was a very difficult person to work with so ¿ things change , things come along ' ' there 's a lot of constructive criticism during the day [ in @entity38 ] , ' @entity11 told @entity80			1
' the bucket seems to get full every set from now on since @entity12 has joined the band and everybody 's been looking for us to get a bass player			1
' but just like many a hard - core metal band , in order to rock hard , these boys like to drink hard , keeping their energy up on stage by swilling mug after mug of hot chocolate			1
' the thing is i hate when we got ta pay for our own food and drinks and hot chocolate or whatever ' cause in @entity38 in april it 's kind of cold but then in the afternoon it gets hot and then it goes back cold again , ' @entity11 adds			1
' we had to pay for hot chocolate , it came out of our expenses			1
' their other vices are pizza and @entity69 food while their ' signature candy ' is mint m&ms			1
homeworkers : but it is n't all head banging and hot chocolate for these boys , they still have to go to school and do their homework big gigs : @entity10 bought his first guitar from @entity120 when he was two years old inspired by favourite bands @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and others , @entity10 and @entity11 formed their first band @entity130 in 2007			1
they currently do n't have a lead singer , preferring to perform as a purely instrument - led group			0
perhaps it 's just as well , as their pre-adolescent voices might not yet stand up to the strain of heavy metal howling			0
but it has not always been so			0
indeed , they used to have a singer but remain tight - lipped over exactly why he left the group			0
' he was a very difficult person to work with so … things change , things come along , ' says @entity11 mysteriously			1
hard decisions : they do n't currently have a lead singer because ' he was a difficult person to work with ... things change ' but it is n't all head banging and hot chocolate for these boys , they still have to go to school and do their homework			1
they say they do n't love the classroom but go because ' it 's important '			0
but all three love science and social studies , because it 's ' like a comic book with all those wars and fights '			0
what 's their advice for younger musicians struggling to make it in the dog - eat - dog world of heavy metal ? ' believe in your dreams , ' says @entity11			0
' hard work pays off			0
' adds @entity12 : ' follow your heart ' .			2

@entity180 and @entity12 , are from @entity16
they *regularly* busk in @entity38 where they say the bucket fills fast
they keep energy up on stage by swilling mug after mug of hot chocolate
their other vice is pizza , @entity69 food and mint @entity71
once had a singer but ' he was a difficult person to work with , things change '
