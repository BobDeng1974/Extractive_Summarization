many conspiracy theorists unhappy with the official account of the assassination of @entity3 have pointed to evidence they believe shows that the president was shot twice , from different directions			1
now a new documentary has come up with a new twist on the conspiracy theory , claiming that a @entity11 agent was the man who fired that shot ... by accident			1
@entity14 : the @entity15 claims that @entity16 , a @entity11 man riding in the car behind @entity3 , accidentally fired his weapon on november 22 , 1963			1
what really happened ? @entity11 agent @entity21 stands on the rear bumper of @entity14 's car as @entity24 bends over her husband moments after he was shot as they drove through @entity27 , @entity28 it alleges that a cover - up was then carried out to save the blushes of the agency whose main role is to protect serving and former @entity36 leaders - leaving the many loose ends that have long raised suspicions			1
it is said that as much as 75 per cent of the @entity36 public do not believe the official account of the @entity3 assassination			1
the new documentary is based on the work of @entity44 , a veteran @entity45 police detective who has undertaken a four - year investigation into the killing			1
his theories are based on the work of @entity16 , who spent two decades probing the assassination and whose work was presented in the book @entity16 : the shot that killed @entity14 , by @entity16			1
both mr @entity55 and mr @entity56 spoke yesterday about the film at the @entity59 press tour in @entity60 , @entity61			2
he wanted people to feel close to him : president @entity3 asked to travel in an open - top car while officers were told to slow right down to allow the crowds to see the first couple @entity69 to their case is the claim that @entity71 and his @entity11 colleagues had been out partying the night before @entity3 's motorcade drove through @entity27			1
to compound the problems the hungover agent faced , @entity74 says he has found evidence that @entity71 had not been properly trained to use the @entity79 gun he was carrying that morning			2
' it was his first time in the follow car , his first time holding the assault weapon he was using , ' the @entity80 reported @entity74 as saying			0
the theory is that as the assassin opened fire , @entity71 grabbed his own gun			0
but when the whole motorcade shunted to a halt , the agent was jolted by the sudden stop and accidentally pulled the trigger - firing a bullet straight at the back of @entity3 's head			1
mr @entity44 said he believes agent @entity71 's @entity79 was loaded with different from the ammunition used by @entity96 , who the @entity97 declared in 1964 to be the lone gunman in the assassination			2
that , he claims , explains what they believe are the different ballistic profiles of the two bullets that struck @entity3			2
the first description of the shooter was broadcast at 12.35pm			0
at 1.51pm officers reported @entity96 had been apprehended @entity96 was himself assassinated before he could stand trial over the killing			0
mr @entity55 insisted that they do not believe that agent @entity71 intentionally fired at @entity3			1
rather , the @entity80 reported him as saying , ' this was a tragic accident in the heat of the moment			0
' but the pair do allege that the government moved swiftly , with the help of @entity3 's brother @entity117 , to cover up the @entity11 's involvement and save the agency from embarrassment			1
agent @entity71 , who died two years ago , said in his witness statement given the day after @entity3 's assassination that after he heard the gunfire he did indeed rise to his feet and load and cock the @entity79 , but did not fire it			1
he said : ' at the end of the last report i reached to the bottom of the car and picked up the @entity79 rifle , cocked and loaded it , and turned to the rear			0
' at this point the cars were passing under the over-pass and as a result we had left the scene of the shooting			0
i kept the @entity79 rifle ready as we proceeded at a high rate of speed to the hospital			0
' mr @entity55 's book , which was published in 1992 , claims that it was a shot from agent @entity71 's gun that actually killed the president , citing evidence which appeared to show that @entity3 was hit by two different kinds of bullet			1
@entity79 rounds are encased in thin copper and tend to break up upon impact , as did the shot that struck @entity3 in the head			1
a 6.5mm @entity156 bullet of the kind known to have been fired by @entity96 , on the other hand , would not break up when it hit the target			0
agent @entity71 sued mr @entity55 in 1995 over the allegations contained in @entity162 , but the case was dismissed after a judge ruled that he had taken too long after the book 's publication to file his case			0
@entity168 , the agent in charge of the @entity11 detail protecting vice president @entity171 on the day , also denied suggestions that @entity71 fired his weapon			2
in an interview with the @entity176 alumni magazine in 1992 , just prior to @entity16 's publication , he labelled the theory ' ridiculous '			2
' i do n't think any @entity11 guy fired his weapon down there that day			2
i could look ahead and see [ @entity182 ] @entity71 , an agent in the president 's follow - up car , who had the @entity79 [ rifle ]			0
he stood up and looked , but did n't see anything to fire at , ' he said			0
president @entity3 pictured hours before his assassination : it is said that as much as 75 per cent of the @entity36 public do not believe the official account of the assassination given by the @entity97 @entity14 : the @entity15 will be broadcast on the @entity192 on november 3			2
a spokesman for the network said : what makes @entity74 's investigation different than those that came before it is the fact that he had all the evidence , facts and eyewitness testimony from fifty years ago as well as modern forensic technology			0
' @entity74 â€™s findings are a far cry from the fanciful conspiracy theories that usually surround this assassination			0
' his case is methodically constructed from simple logic and available evidence using time - tested investigative techniques to solve the crime ; including key archival photographic evidence , medical reports and bullet science			0

film alleges that agent @entity16 accidentally shot @entity3 in the head
it is based on the work of veteran @entity45 police detective who has spent four years investigating the assassination
the government then covered up the @entity11 role , it is claimed , to save the agency from embarrassment
