' mr @entity10 , whose wife @entity34 is from @entity35 , unearthed the emails as part of a @entity39 request			1

@entity107 said ' it was not beyond the balance of possibility ' that the observation sheet , recording measurements such as his temperature , had been destroyed , ' and if that was done it can only have been done deliberately '			0
