by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 17:22 est , 17 july 2012 the @entity2 governor insisted yesterday that he knew nothing about the manipulation of crucial interest rates until just two weeks ago			2
during a grilling by mps on the @entity9 , sir @entity6 said he was not aware of the ruthless rigging of rates – even though he was warned about it four years ago			2
the governor was sent an email by @entity15 ’s @entity14 in june 2008 , which made a clear reference to ‘ deliberate misreporting ’ of @entity18 , the interbank lending rate			2
but he insisted : ‘ that is a million miles away from saying that is the same as a deliberate , deceitful manipulation of [ @entity18 ] submissions in order to make financial gain			0
‘ there was no suggestion of fraudulent behaviour or wrongdoing or anything of the sort			0
’ @entity45 mp @entity44 yesterday accused sir @entity6 of being ‘ in denial ’ about the rigging of @entity18 rates			1
sir @entity6 ’s deputy @entity49 also came under fire for failing to react to the note warning about irregularities in the @entity18 rate , signed by @entity54 , now the @entity15 treasury secretary			1
advance warning : the email from @entity54 , then head of the @entity58 , to sir @entity6 in 2008 in which suggestion to reform @entity18 were attached the committee heard that sir @entity6 , left , was warned about the @entity18 index being ' deliberately misreported ' by the then president of the @entity63 @entity54 , right , as long ago as 2008 @entity64 , a @entity65 mp , asked repeatedly how the words ‘ deliberate misreporting ’ , in the first paragraph of the @entity63 ’s note , could not have triggered alarm			1
mr @entity49 , who had been the frontrunner to succeed sir @entity6 next year , said : ‘ i ’m not sure i addressed my mind to it			1
’ asked by mr @entity64 why the ‘ penny did not drop at the phrase “ deliberate misreporting ” ’ , he added : ‘ it did not set off dishonesty alarm bells			1
’ but he later admitted there had been misreporting , adding : ‘ it turns out that , with hindsight , yes , it was but it did not set alarm bells ringing at the time , i ’m afraid			1
’ denial : the hearing of the @entity9 ( pictured ) heard how sir @entity6 told @entity86 that @entity87 was in a ' state of denial ' over regulatory concerns with the bank following its rate - rigging scandal @entity45 mp @entity92 said the evidence emerging was increasingly embarrassing for @entity95 authorities when compared with their @entity15 counterparts			1
he said : ‘ the @entity15 authorities all the way along have been more worried , hungrier for the story and more active in pursuing it than we have in the @entity95			0
’ but sir @entity6 said : ‘ neither did the @entity63 nor anybody else send us any evidence of misreporting			2
’ the scandal began with a devastating dossier , published by the @entity110 last month , about the ruthless tactics used by rogue traders at @entity87 to fiddle @entity18			0
email : former @entity87 boss @entity114 wrote to mr @entity49 on his appointment as deputy @entity2 governor saying ' i am really , really proud of you ' the 44 - page report reveals extraordinary emails showing how traders promised to celebrate together with champagne and cappuccinos if they managed to pull off the con			1
in one email , a trader at a different bank wrote to ‘ @entity129 ’ at @entity87 : ‘ dude			2
i owe you big time ! come over one day after work and i ’m opening a bottle of @entity134			0
’ the scandal , which is expected to spread to at least another seven banks , has triggered the resignations of the three most senior executives at @entity87 and a £ 290million fine			0
yesterday sir @entity6 hinted that @entity95 regulators had been hindered by light - touch regulation pioneered under the former @entity45 government			1
he told @entity86 : ‘ i remember very clearly before 2007 to be a regulator ... was to have no support from anybody			2
dare i say it , even in @entity146			0
‘ the consensus was anything that the regulator did was to impede the workings of our efficient and dynamic financial services industry			0
’ sir @entity6 also revealed his involvement in the departure of @entity114 , the former chief executive of @entity87 , who resigned just six days after the @entity110 ’s report came out			1
the bank governor summoned the @entity87 chairman to a meeting at 6pm on monday , july 2 , and made clear that mr @entity114 had lost the confidence of the regulators			1
he told @entity86 there were ‘ genuine and deep ’ concerns about @entity87			1
‘ it is possible to sail close to the wind , once , twice or even three times but when it gets to four or five times then you have to look at the captain on the bridge , ’ sir @entity6 added			1
scandal : the libor rate - fixing scandal has already claimed the scalps of bank boss @entity114 and two other senior @entity87 executives and sir @entity6 said that the bank ' sailed close to the wind ' @entity18 , short for @entity18 , is the average interest rate at which banks lend to each other			1
it is calculated from daily submissions by 16 leading global banks			0
each bank sends details of the rate it pays to borrow money from other banks			0
the rate is an indicator of the financial health of a company			0
just as countries such as @entity192 and @entity193 can expect to pay more to borrow when their finances are in a poor state , a bank in a perilous position will have to pay a higher interest rate to persuade other financial firms to take the risk of lending to it			0
the libor rate relies on banks being honest about the rate at which they borrow			2
this is now emerging as one of the reasons why it has been open to abuse			0
the rate reflects an estimated $ 550 trillion worth of loans and derivatives			0
it also has an impact on the rates of consumer borrowing , such as mortgages , student loans and credit cards			0
libor rate submissions could therefor increase the interest rates at which the public borrow , potentially leading to higher profits for banks .			2

deputy governor @entity49 said the warning from the @entity15 ' did not set alarm bells ringing '
emails have emerged showing the close relationship between mr @entity49 and former @entity87 boss @entity114
@entity45 mp claims the emails show the @entity2 ' tried to get banks to lower libor rate '
sir @entity6 told @entity86 that @entity87 was in a ' state of denial ' over regulatory concerns with the bank
he said the bank sailed ' too close to the wind ' several times with regulators and said it was time to create ' a new bank with a new *culture* '
