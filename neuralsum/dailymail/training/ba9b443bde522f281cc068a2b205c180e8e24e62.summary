the findings of a potentially explosive investigation into a massive leak of highly confidential documents stolen from the heart of the @entity6 are to remain top secret , it has emerged			1
pope @entity8 launched a probe into the so - called ' @entity11 ' scandal which erupted after his former butler released private papers taken from the papal chambers			1
@entity16 newspapers have been rife with unsourced reports claiming the dossier produced by three cardinals looking into the incident unearthed an underground network of senior clergy who have organised gay homosexual parties and faced blackmail			1
according to the @entity6 , the @entity8 today met with @entity38 cardinal , @entity39 ; cardinal @entity40 , a former archbishop of @entity42 ; and the @entity44 cardinal @entity43 - nicknamed ' the 007 @entity45 ' by the @entity16 media - in private			1
a statement from the @entity6 said : ' the holy father has decided that the acts of this investigation , known only to himself , remain solely at the disposition of the new pope			1
' thanking the cardinals for their investigation , the statement added : ' their work made it possible to detect , given the limitations and imperfections of the human factor of every institution , the generosity and dedication of those who work with uprightness and generosity in the @entity6			1
' no confirmation or denial : @entity6 spokesman @entity68 the @entity6 had rubbished @entity16 media reports alleging the pope 's resignation is linked to a secret dossier claiming there is a ' gay network ' inside the clergy			1
it even accused the @entity16 media of spreading ' false and damaging ' reports in an attempt to influence cardinals who will meet in a secret conclave next month to elect a new pope			1
@entity83 newspaper had carried lurid claims about the report into the ' @entity11 ' scandal which was presented to the @entity32 on or around december 17			2
the report came in two volumes , ' hard - bound in red ' with the title ' pontifical secret '			2
they launched the probe after the @entity8 's butler , @entity11 , was arrested and charged with stealing and leaking papal correspondence revealing how the @entity6 was a centre of intrigue and infighting			1
@entity83 claimed pope @entity8 quit because could not face the repercussions of dealing with the 300 - page dossier - the first @entity32 to resign in 700 years			1
the paper says that the investigation alleges a gay lobby exists within the @entity103 , and has some sort of control on the careers of those in the @entity6			1
the report is quoted as saying : ' the cardinals were said to have uncovered an underground gay network , whose members organise sexual meetings in several venues in @entity114 and @entity115 , leaving them prone to blackmail			0
' they included a villa outside the @entity16 capital , a sauna in a @entity114 suburb , a beauty parlour in the centre , and a former university residence that was in use by a provincial @entity16 archbishop			0
' @entity83 says that the cardinals described a number of ' factions ' in their report , including one in which individuals were ' united by sexual orientation '			1
the newspaper also alleges the dossier states that members of this group were blackmailed by laymen with whom they entertain relationships of a ' worldly nature '			0
sent to @entity141 : @entity142 has been promoted , according to the @entity6 spokesman it quoted an unnamed source said to be close to the report 's authors : ' everything revolves around the non-observance of the sixth and seventh commandments			2
' the seventh commandment forbids theft , while the sixth forbids adultery , but is linked in @entity156 doctrine to the proscribing of homosexual acts , explained the @entity159			0
the dossier will stay in a secret papal safe and delivered to @entity8 's successor when the @entity8 leaves office , claims @entity83			1
the pope himself has said merely that he does n't have the ' strength of mind and body ' to carry on and would resign feb. 28			0
the @entity6 claims the reports are an attempt to influence the election of the next pope			2
the @entity6 secretariat of state said the @entity103 has for centuries insisted on the independence of its cardinals to freely elect their pope - a reference to episodes in the past when kings and emperors vetoed papal contenders or prevented cardinals from voting outright			0
' if in the past , the so - called powers , i.e. , @entity189 , exerted pressures on the election of the pope , today there is an attempt to do this through public opinion that is often based on judgments that do not typically capture the spiritual aspect of the moment that the church is living , ' the statement said			0
' it is deplorable that as we draw closer to the time of the beginning of the conclave ... that there be a widespread distribution of often unverified , unverifiable or completely false news stories that cause serious damage to persons and institutions			0
' tribute : @entity103 gather to watch the @entity8 in one of this last public appearances some @entity6 watchers have speculated that because the @entity6 bureaucracy is heavily @entity16 , cardinals might be persuaded to elect a non-italian , @entity217 - based cardinal as pope to try to impose some reform on the @entity220			1
@entity6 spokesman the rev. @entity221 said the reports ' do not correspond to reality ' but the pope and some of his closest collaborators have recently denounced the dysfunction in the @entity227			2
cardinal @entity229 , for example , criticized the ' divisions , dissent , careerism , jealousies ' that afflict the @entity6 bureaucracy			0
he made the comments on friday - the penultimate day of the @entity6 's weeklong spiritual exercises that were attended by the pope and other officials			0
@entity8 too has made reference to the divisions in recent days , deploring in his final @entity240 as pope on @entity242 how the church is often ' defiled ' by attacks and divisions from within			0
last sunday , he urged its members to overcome ' pride and egoism '			0
on saturday , in his final comments to the @entity220 , @entity8 lamented the ' evil , suffering and corruption ' that have defaced @entity254 's creation			0
but he also thanked the @entity6 bureaucrats for having helped him ' bear the burden ' of his ministry with their work , love and faith these past eight years			0
the @entity6 's attack on the media echoed its response to previous scandals , where it has tended not to address the underlying content of accusations , but has diverted attention away			2
during the 2010 explosion of sex abuse scandals , the @entity6 accused the media of trying to attack the pope ; during the 2012 leaks scandal , it accused the media of sensationalism without addressing the content of the leaked documents .			2
