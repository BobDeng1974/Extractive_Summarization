@entity1 scientists say the largest rodent ever had giant incisors that it used like elephant tusks , based on skull analysis the largest rodent ever to have lived may have used its front teeth just like an elephant uses its tusks , according to a new study			1
the rodent would have been the size of a buffalo , with the largest incisors of any rodent ever known to have existed			1
@entity17 , a rodent closely related to guinea pigs , lived in @entity19 approximately three million years ago			1
it is the largest fossil rodent ever found , with an estimated body mass of 2,200lbs ( 1,000kg ) , and it was similar in size to a buffalo			1
the study was led by scientists at the @entity27 and the @entity28			0
dr @entity29 , of the @entity30 , a joint research centre of the @entity27 's @entity32 and @entity28 , used computer modelling to estimate how powerful the bite of @entity35 could be - comparable to that of a tiger			2
speaking to @entity38 , he said the only fossil they have is a skull that is around 20 inches ( 50cm ) in length - which makes it the largest rodent ever			1
but using it was enough to work out how large and powerful the teeth of the rodent would have been			0
‘ like all rodents it had just a single pair of incisors in the upper and lower jaw , and these are large curved structures that grow throughout life , ’ he said			0
‘ like most rodents it was herbivorous , and the environment it lived in was something like an estuary or water land , at the margins of water , eating maybe aquatic plant material or something			2
’ he thinks the incisors were likely used either to dig into the ground to get at roots to eat , or to defend the animal			2
the entire circular length of the incisors was likely about 10 inches ( 25cm ) , with only a small part of that actually protruding from the mouth			0
the rest pushed back into the skull			0
@entity17 , a rodent closely related to guinea pigs , lived in @entity19 approximately three million years ago			1
it is the largest fossil rodent ever found , with an estimated body mass of 2,200lbs ( 1,000kg ) , and was similar in size to a buffalo ( shown in this comparison ) dr @entity29 , of the @entity30 , a joint research centre of the @entity27 's @entity32 and @entity28 , used computer modelling to estimate how powerful the bite of @entity35 could be from a limited skull of the animal dr @entity29 found that , although the bite forces were very large - around @entity88 , similar to that of a tiger - the incisors would have been able to withstand almost three times that force , based on earlier estimates by a team who first described the fossil in 2008			1
this could have been a ' safety ' measure to survive some of the rodent 's more strenuous tasks			0
he said in a separate statement : ' we concluded that @entity35 must have used its incisors for activities other than biting , such as digging in the ground for food , or defending itself from predators			0
' this is very similar to how a modern day elephant uses its tusks			0
' the research , which is published in the @entity115 , involved @entity116 the @entity17 specimen and making a virtual reconstruction of its skull			2
this was then subjected to finite element analysis , an engineering technique that predicts stress and strain in a complex geometric object			0
dr @entity29 found that , although the bite forces were very large - around @entity88 , similar to that of a tiger - the incisors would have been able to withstand almost three times that force , based on earlier estimates by a team who first described the fossil of the skull ( shown ) in 2008			1

@entity1 scientists say the largest rodent ever had giant incisors
based on analysis of a skull fossil , they are thought to have been used like elephant tusks to dig and for self - defence
the animal was the size of a buffalo and had the bite power of a tiger
the incisors would have been 25cm long and extended back into the skull
@entity17 , which lived three million years ago , was herbivorous - so the incisors were not used to eat other animals
