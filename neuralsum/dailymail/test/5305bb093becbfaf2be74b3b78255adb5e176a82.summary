a vicious swan known for terrorising punters and kayakers on the @entity3 is now believed to have a grandson following in his footsteps			1
the savage swan nicknamed @entity7 , which still has many brown baby feathers , has been pecking punters on @entity11 area of the @entity13 river			1
mr @entity14 , the swan believed to be his grandfather , was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers			1
he is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather , and his father @entity45 , who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer			2
@entity57 , 65 , who lives near the river , said : ‘ he is even more vicious than his father and grandfather			2
' ( @entity61 ) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers			0
i ’ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics			0
' once i even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne			0
‘ it ’s terrifying for river users and it ’s making people think twice about going out on the water			0
’ another resident , @entity76 , 52 , said locals were worried @entity7 ’s behaviour would get worse as he gets older			2
‘ the swan is only young at the moment , we ’re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger , ’ he said			2
shock : the swan got up close with this woman , whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen ( right ) making an appearance : the juvenile swan nicknamed @entity7 got far too close for comfort to tourists on the @entity3 over the @entity24 weekend naughty swan : one resident said locals were worried @entity7 ’s behaviour on the @entity3 would get worse as he gets older ‘ he swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way			1
we thought mr @entity14 and @entity45 were bad , but this swan is even worse			1
‘ it ’s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now , if he continues someone could get really hurt			0
’ but @entity106 , navigation officer for @entity107 , told @entity108 today : ‘ most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year			0
‘ it 's mating season - they protect their territory			0
as far as i ’m aware , it 's not causing great problems on the river			0
‘ @entity117 this time of year start to look out for their nest , and indeed when the young and born			2
‘ it ’s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans , the more aggressive they tend to become			0
close to the camera : @entity7 ' swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way ' , according to one local resident worrying : @entity7 's actions are said to be ' terrifying for river users ' and are ' making people think twice about going out on the water ' threatening : the behaviour of mr @entity14 ( above ) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises no longer there : the @entity136 moved mr @entity14 about 60 miles away in 2012			1
his son @entity45 is seen above in this file photograph ' they get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed. ’ he confirmed that there are no plans to remove @entity7 from the river , adding that the case of mr @entity14 was completely different			1
mr @entity106 said : ‘ that swan ( mr @entity14 ) was extremely aggressive - it 's the most aggressive swan i 've ever come across			1
‘ i believe that was probably down to the way he 'd been brought up looking for food from various people			0
’ the @entity107 moved mr @entity14 away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself			1
his behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students			2
it has previously been reported how @entity45 was seen attacking punters , birds and even a cow			1
he also injured a canoeist and a swimmer .			0
