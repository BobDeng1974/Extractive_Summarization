by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 click here for the latest leaderboard from @entity4 it was supposed to be @entity6 who suffered from freaky fridays but instead it was @entity8 whose bid to become @entity4 champion was nearly over before the weekend after a shocking five - over - par second round of 77 at @entity12			1
after an impressive opening 69 it was not out of the question that @entity16 could still somehow conjure a magnificent victory in just his second tournament following major back surgery in march			1
in the end only a birdie at the final hole helped the 14 - time major winner survive into the weekend with a score of two - over - par after two rounds - right on the cut - mark			1
alas , it was not his back that was bothering him but his achilles heel			0
woods struggled to control the flight of his ball and opened with a double bogey , followed by a bogey at the second			2
from then on @entity8 played remarkably steady golf , carding 14 pars in succession but failing to take advantage of three par fives – holes where birdies are crucial for anyone hoping to lift the game ’s ultimate prize come sunday evening			1
then , on the 17th tee , disaster struck			0
woods again reached for the driver but carved it wildly out of bounds into the hospitality tents on the right			0
he walked down the fairway in the vain hope that his ball was playable but was soon forced back to the tee			2
@entity101 took driver , this time he hooked it way left and into deep rough			0
a triple bogey seven was the inevitable result and suddenly the former world no 1 was scrambling to make the cut			2
looking for the extra something : @entity8 waits on the tenth tee during the second round of @entity4 , pondering what his next shot will be anguish : @entity8 hacked his way around @entity12 on friday and could only manage a five - over - par round of 77 at the @entity33 splashing around in the sand : @entity8 found himself in the bunker on the first hole at @entity33 and it did n't really improve much from there @entity8 in the long grass : woods found himself finding hazard after hazard around @entity12 as he struggled to find his rhythm and control his swing up in the air : @entity8 lifts his foot and holds his club in a frustrated manner after his approach shot on the seventh hole during the second round of @entity4 @entity8 needed a birdie at the last to ensure his place in the field at the weekend			1
a good drive was imperative			0
but , with out - of - bounds again lurking down the right , @entity8 opted to hit a three - wood			1
he nailed that down the middle of the fairway but left 261 yards for his second shot , which missed to the right of the green			0
a deft chip left a nervy six - footer for birdie and a chance to play at the weekend			1
woods had never suffered back - to - back missed cuts in his entire career , which has been built upon his ability to deliver in the tensest moments - just like this			1
typical @entity8 , he nailed the putt			2
but with @entity16 just scraping through to the weekend he will now face further questions over whether his driver swing will ever again be able to deliver the four majors he still needs to overtake @entity168 ’s record of 18			1
' i got off to a terrible start again , ' @entity8 said			0
' and i had some opportunities to make a few birdies along the way to get back to even par for the day , and i just never did			2
i just never made anything			0
i had myself in good positions to make birdies , and i just did n't do it			0
' @entity8 is still hopeful of a victory , and referred to @entity180 's heroics at the @entity181 , when the @entity182 completed the biggest comeback in major championship history by recovering from 10 strokes behind in the final round , and winning the subsequent three - man play off against @entity188 and @entity189			1
' i 'm pretty far back			0
luckily i 've got two rounds to go			0
and hopefully i can do something like @entity180 did in ' 99			0
he made up , i think , ten in one day			0
hopefully i can play well on the weekend and at least give myself a shot at going to the back nine on sunday			2
' @entity6 , meanwhile , shot a second successive 66 to move to 12 - under - par and heads into the weekend 14 shots ahead of @entity8			1
down on his knees : the 14 - time major winner smirks in frustration as he misses a putt during his five - over - par round of 77 at @entity12 silhouette : @entity8 waits on the 13th green as he lifts back his cap and scratches his head as he struggled around @entity12 on friday eyes on you : the @entity207 putts on the fourth green during the 143rd @entity4 at @entity12 as a fake giant octopus looks on from a nearby house @entity211 of brilliance : despite his struggles , @entity8 still showed glimpses of his breathtaking best as he produced some excellent recovery shots at @entity12			1

@entity16 ' round of 77 saw him fall back from three - under *overnight* to two - over - par , exactly on the cut - mark
the @entity207 is playing in just his second tournament since *undergoing* major back surgery in march
the 14 - time major winner shot an opening round of 69 on *thursday* at the @entity33
but @entity8 struggled to get to grips with the course during his second round and fell 12 shots off the pace
woods forced to birdie the 18th at @entity12 to make the weekend on the cut - mark of two - over - par
@entity6 leads @entity4 going into the weekend on 12 - under - par , 14 shots clear of @entity16
