but now a technology firm based in @entity16 claims to have the answer - a patch which makes the wearer invisible to the insects			1
the @entity21 uses non-toxic compounds that disrupt mosquitoes ' ability to find people through co2 for up to 48 hours			1
the technology was developed by @entity28 and the @entity29 , with backing from the @entity30 and the @entity31			2
for most people in @entity7 bites can be painful , itchy or become infected			2
but for large parts of the developing world , it is much more serious			0
mosquitoes spread malaria which killed 660,000 people in 2010 , according to the @entity39			1
but research published last year suggested the total is actually double that number and closer to 1.2million			1
