in 1982 the traditional sandwich , cocktail sausage and dairylea triangles were kings and queens of the @entity12 outdoor lunch but now these have been binned for some sushi and chorizo			1
a new study comparing our shopping habits over 30 years show we have gone ' posh ' when we head to the park or beach with our loved - ones or friends for something to eat			2
in 1982 the traditional sandwich , cocktail sausage and dairylea triangles were kings and queens of the @entity12 outdoor lunch now we like spinach and filo parcels , some fresh ciabatta and an international cheese board from a wicker basket gone are the days when we would pull out some cheese and pineapple on sticks or fishfingers and white rolls from some tupperware			1
instead it is spinach and filo parcels , some fresh ciabatta and an international cheese board from a wicker basket			1
and while the items in 1982 were almost all from @entity12 , now the average picnic has items from at least 11 countries around the world , from @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 to @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
but there is one constant that us @entity12 still can not resist that was a top ten item 30 years ago - the humble @entity57 pork pie			1
cheese and pineapple on sticks 9			1
tupperware with plastic cutlery now @entity71 2			0
hamper with metal cutlery @entity81 , @entity83 ’s product development director , said : ' while the picnic has been a constant in @entity12 life for years , we ’ve noticed a growing trend for upmarket picnics			1
' years ago , picnics were all soggy sandwiches and rainy days out			2
the weather may not have changed but the make - up of the standard picnic is evolving			0
' it appears that our picnics now are healthier than 30 years ago , as we are now eating less white bread and more fruit			2
fishy business : fish fingers have been swapped for sushi in the modern picnic , a study reveals but @entity105 , of the @entity106 , said the picnics had positives and negatives			1
' both are likely to be high in salt and fat and , as they are lacking much in the way of fruit and vegetables , they are likely also to be low in important vitamins and minerals			0
in the context of a nutrient - rich and well - balanced diet , these picnic foods are fine occasionally , ' she said			0
' but with unlimited amounts of food available today , it is also not hard to fill our picnic basket with tasty food that is also beneficial for our health			0
' @entity83 say that their hamper sales are up almost 50 per cent this year showing that the good old fashioned picnic , whatever people put in them , is more popular than ever			2
experts say this is still a cheap way to entertain friends or family during this recession			0
@entity83 ’s @entity139 said : ' a picnic is one way families are enjoying good food and a day out without breaking the bank			0

a new study shows that most *staples* from 1982 are no *longer* being put in @entity12 hampers
sandwiches , cheese and pineapple and white rolls have been swapped for sushi , chorizo and a cheese board
the humble pork pie is the one treat that we still love
