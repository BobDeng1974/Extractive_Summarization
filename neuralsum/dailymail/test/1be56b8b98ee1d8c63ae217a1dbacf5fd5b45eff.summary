controversial @entity1 celebrity chef @entity0 is under attack again with experts warning his ' reworked ' baby milk formula is dangerous to babies			1
dietitians have singled out a ' happy tummy brew ' in @entity0 ' cookbook , @entity9 : the @entity10 , for @entity11 , babies and @entity13 , because it contains almost five times the maximum vitamin a dose for a baby			1
the original recipe for the ' brew ' contained more than 10 times the maximum daily intake of vitamin a for babies			1
' this new infant ' brew ' could seriously harm babies , ' a spokeswoman for the @entity28 of @entity1 told @entity35			0
' the authors seem to have made a serious mistake with this second version of their liver and broth recipe , suggesting they do not understand the basic scientific and nutrition information relevant for infant feeding			0
' they have said publicly that they have tried to make it safe by reworking the original recipe , and increasing the age for which it 's suggested from 0 - 6 months to now be 6 - 12 months , but they have failed spectacularly to meet any safe standards			0
' the paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of @entity1 to embrace the lifestyle @entity0 's co-authors , wellness blogger @entity52 and naturopath @entity54 , told @entity55 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed ' @entity57 '			1
the pair told the program the recipe had changed			0
' we added vitamin c and some calcium , ' @entity52 told @entity64			0
it comes after @entity0 ' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis			1
a 30 - year - old woman , @entity72 , wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis in september 2013			2
she said that she endured months of constant dizziness , altered temperature perception , extreme fatigue , numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression			0
but after jumping on the paleo diet bandwagon , @entity72 claimed she has not suffered any @entity86 symptoms over the past 12 months , her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever			1
@entity72 's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000 - plus followers on @entity91 on saturday			2
@entity0 has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis ' wow this is powerful story on @entity86 , thanks for sharing @entity72			1
. it will make your heart sing			0
. it has mine , please tag and share wide ! ' @entity0 wrote			2
the @entity1 chef also shared a similarly remarkable testimony by @entity104 , another @entity86 sufferer			1
the woman claimed she has seen significant health improvements after being on @entity0 ' 10 weeks @entity10 program			1
the celebrity chef has been a proud paleo advocate ' i have had a lot of health issues the past years , mainly auto - immune stuff including @entity86 , ' she wrote in the online post			1
' having @entity86 means i 'm always sapped of energy , have numbness , pins and needles , pain , poor concentration , etc. not any more ! ' @entity104 said she was recently able to walk up and down a flight of 811 stairs			1
' no way on earth i could have done that 10 weeks ago , ' she wrote			0
' my concentration and memory is much better and i can also plan better			0
i 'm not off my @entity86 meds yet but i am off my thyroid and @entity130 meds			2
' thanks so much @entity0 and team for helping me get my life back			2
you 've made this road so easy			0
as an added bonus i 've gone from a size 16 to a size 12			0
' the @entity139 judge has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting the benefits of a ' caveman diet ' that cuts out grains , legumes , sugar and dairy			1
but , @entity72 praised @entity0 for his endorsement of the controversial diet , and said ' the way you are changing the lives of others by leading an example is remarkable '			1
' i have been inspired by your encouragement , great recipes and educated by the accurate information you provide , ' @entity72 wrote			2
' @entity0 , i thank you so very much for bringing paleo in to the mainstream - people no longer look at me as though i 'm a weirdo for following this way of life			2
' in another recent @entity91 post , the @entity1 chef shared a similarly remarkable testimony by @entity104 who also suffers from @entity86 @entity0 has drawn criticism from health experts for promoting a controversial caveman ' diet ' @entity171 associate professor of dietetics @entity172 pointed out @entity72 's diet might have been unhealthy before adapting the @entity10 lifestyle			1
' her diet may have been poor previously , ' dr @entity172 told @entity177			0
' there are so many factors to pinpoint - specifically how her condition changed and we do n't know what her diet and eating habits were like before			0
' by eating lean meat , good oil and high intake of bioactive plants such as leafy and root vegetables - could all have a beneficial effect because all of these foods work significantly well together			0
' but we do n't actually know if her condition is cured so it 's hard to advocate on because there 's no scientific evidence to back this up			1
' the paleo lifestyle , which @entity0 is a long - time supporter of , bans all dairy , grains , preservatives and sugar @entity204 @entity203 said while the diet seemed to have worked for @entity72 , it might not work for others			1
' @entity0 can share whatever he likes to his followers but there 's never going to be one magic bullet to cure an illness or a serious disease , ' dr @entity208 told @entity177			0
' someone reporting an anecdote might be true in one person 's case but it 's very difficult to imply it to others , which can be quite misleading for people			0
the paleo style of eating , which @entity0 is a proud supporter of , has been sweeping across the globe ' they could feel failure when it does n't work for them , especially when they try to cure a serious condition like this			2
' i would n't recommend any particular diet for anyone suffering any type of illnesses			0
' the paleo style of eating , which @entity0 is a proud supporter of , has swept the globe and involves a high intake of meat , fish , eggs , vegetables , some fruits , seeds and nuts .			2
