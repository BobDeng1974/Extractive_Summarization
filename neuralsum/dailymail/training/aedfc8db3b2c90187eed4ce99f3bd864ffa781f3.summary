this is the medical student who called herself @entity2 and controversially auctioned off her virginity - only to change her mind at the last minute , @entity5 can reveal			1
@entity6 , a high - achieving college graduate , made headlines around the world when she dubbed herself the ' @entity9 ' and said she would sleep with the highest bidder			1
the intelligent , middle - class bioengineering student backed out of the sleazy auction on wednesday , with the fee standing at $ 801,000			1
revealed : @entity15 is actually high - achieving graduate @entity6 ' with the blessings of my management and the high bidders , i have decided to put a stop to this kerfuffle ( to describe it nicely ) and return my focus to my medical training , ' she wrote on her blog , provocatively entitled musings of a @entity9			1
' i still do possess some spitefully strong beliefs about virginity , prostitution , and a woman 's right to do as she damned pleases , but school is my first priority ( as it has been for my entire life )			2
' at this point , i no longer care about the auction , at all			2
this was a very easy decision			2
' but despite her claims to have abandoned the auction to concentrate on her schooling , @entity5 can reveal that @entity6 hardly received any genuine offers for her virginity			1
in fact the , ' winning ' bidder refused to go through any kind of vetting process and completely disappeared after he pledged to come up with the cash			2
a source close to @entity6 said : ' this auction did n't work , plain and simple			1
@entity6 had to face the fact that maybe her virginity was n't worth as much as she thought it was			1
' @entity5 can also reveal furious professors at her college , the @entity52 , found out about the auction and hauled her in to explain herself			1
they have agreed to allow her to take crucial qualifying exams next friday , but she will have to go in for talks next month			0
auction : @entity60 offered up her virginity on a website , where she used the name @entity2 at that point they will let her know what disciplinary action she will face for sullying the name of the prestigious university			1
they have already told her that her ‘ immoral ’ behavior has put her future career in the medical profession in serious jeopardy			0
since abandoning the auction , @entity74 - born @entity6 , has been keeping a low profile in her shared apartment in the north of @entity79			1
on friday fellow students on campus said they recognized @entity6 as the girl in the racy pictures posted on her blog site , but were in disbelief that that the ' shy ' pupil would take part in such a scandalous enterprise			1
one male undergraduate said : ' i am absolutely amazed			0
i saw the story online and straight away i said it looks like @entity6 , but i could n't believe it was actually her			1
' she 's a really quiet , shy girl and this seems so out of character			1
' and after examining @entity6 ’s personality it seems she had been living a double live			1
her fellow students knew her as a shy , studious pupil and the rest of the world knew her alter - ego , the opinionated and provocative @entity104 , @entity2			1
in a string of forthright blog boasts , @entity2 initially explained how she was selling her virginity for the money			0
but in recent days , her tone changed and became far more political			0
' it is no longer about the money , ' she wrote			0
' instead , very broadly , it is about how society continues to exercise control over female sexuality by chaining it tightly to female morality			0
cold feet : @entity60 pulled out of her online auction on wednesday , saying she wanted to focus on her studies ' it is about the fact that we have not left patriarchy in the past ( we all know male morality is not judged by the same standard ) , and that a woman still can not chose to do with her body what she pleases without eliciting condemnation and hate from those ( or some of those ) around her			1
' it seems she did n’t express those kinds of feminist views when she was studying for her undergraduate degree at the @entity143 in @entity144			0
@entity6 excelled during her time there and wrote a number of incredibly complex medical papers			1
she graduated in 2010 and started at the @entity52 , where she has specialized in bioengineering			1
again , she has impressed in medical research and contributed to a number of ground - breaking papers alongside other students and professors			1
@entity6 ’s family life also seems at odds with her racy alter - ego			1
her father @entity60 is a successful business man , who lives in @entity158 , @entity159 and works as the principal consultant for the oil and gas firm he founded , @entity162			1
his @entity164 profile says he has 35 years experience and that he has authored numerous papers			0
he is a graduate of the @entity167			0
his work in the oil industry took the family to @entity171 about 20 years ago			0
he lived in the @entity172 in @entity173 with @entity6 , her mother @entity174 , and her younger brother @entity175 , who now lives in @entity176 , @entity177			1
@entity6 suffered a personal tragedy at the age of ten , when her mother died in a plane crash near @entity182 , @entity183 , in 1996			2
at the time it was the third - worst disaster in aviation history , claiming the lives of 349 people			2
@entity6 - whose story made international headlines after representation by @entity192 firm @entity191 - claimed on her blog that her family were fully behind her decision to sell her virginity			1
auction : despite attracting a bid of $ 801,000 , a source claims those making the offers went quiet when asked to prove their credentials but on friday her father refused to speak to @entity5 over the phone , hanging up as soon as his daughter 's name was mentioned			0
@entity6 did respond to email , declining an interviewing , saying she was , ' very busy and stressed right now , with pressing school commitments '			2
when she set up the auction website , she initially hid her face , simply showing off her body in a series of provocative shots , professionally taken in a @entity79 hotel			0
but after prospective bidders started to pull out because they could not see what she looked like , she changed her approach and posted a series of snaps giving away her identity			0
bizarrely , she insisted she still wanted to remain anonymous , even though her heavily airbrushed image was there for all to see			0
and despite claims that bids for her virginity came flooding in , a source close to @entity6 has revealed the majority were from chancers who refused to prove they had any way of coming up with the cash			2
the source said : ' @entity6 has tried to pass this off as a success and said she took the decision to pull out despite that			2
' but this auction did not really work			0
sure , loads of bids came in , but when the men in question were asked to prove their credentials they went quiet			0
' they could have been sitting in a trailer park without two cents to rub together , pledging to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars			0
' the winning bidder laid down the offer , but when he was sent an email asking to send his number so he could be vetted , he went completely quiet			0
there is no way it was a genuine bid			0
' who knows why @entity6 decided to pull out , but it might well have been because her virginity was n't worth as much as she thought it was			2
' @entity6 launched the online auction on march 31 , but it seems she established the domain name of her website last june , meaning the auction was planned for almost a year			1
initially , she said she wanted to sell her virginity because she was attracted by the adventure , eroticism , scandal and the chance to challenge the norm			0
in an interview with the @entity269 , while her identity was still a closely guarded secret , @entity6 said she was still a virgin because sex and relationships came second to school work and other commitments			2
' i have a busy life			2
i am picky and guys were never a priority , ' she said			0
she also admitted she was concerned her ' business venture ' might get her thrown out of college if officials learned she 's the ' @entity281			0
' ' lawyers have different opinions on whether i 'd get kicked out , but one lawyer i trust believes it wo n't happen , ' she said			0
if she had gone through with the deal , the sex would have taken place in @entity192 because prostitution is illegal in the @entity290			0
