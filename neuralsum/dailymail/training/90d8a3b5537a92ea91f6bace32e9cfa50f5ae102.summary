by @entity0 edging slowly out of her dry dock at @entity4 , this is the third of the @entity6 class submarines that will take the @entity8 's fighting capabilities into the @entity9			1
the 97m long , 7,400 tonne nuclear - powered attack submarine @entity10 has cost taxpayers more than £ 1billion but , along with its sisters , sets a new standard in weapons load and stealth			1
armed with both @entity21 heavy torpedoes and @entity23 cruise missiles , @entity19 's design marks a shift away from a @entity25 focus on anti-submarine warfare to a concept of ' @entity28 to @entity29 '			1
more than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask the vessel 's sonar signature , meaning she slips through the seas with less noise than a baby dolphin			1
yet her sonar is said to be so powerful it can detect ships leaving harbour in @entity57 from a listening point below the waters of the @entity60 , 3,000 nautical miles away			0
@entity19 got her toes wet for the first time yesterday , more than 24 hours after she first emerged from the @entity62 in @entity4 , @entity63			0
she was officially named last september by @entity64 , @entity65 , wife of the @entity8 ’s @entity66 , admiral sir @entity67			0
stealth : more than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask @entity19 's sonar signature , meaning she will slip through the seas with less noise than a baby dolphin @entity71 : yet her sonar is so powerful it can detect ships from 3,000 nautical miles away - equivalent to the distance between the @entity60 and @entity57 expensive : the 97m long , 7,400 tonne nuclear - powered attack submarine @entity10 has cost taxpayers more than £ 1billion @entity76 , @entity77 for @entity32 , said : ' the launch of @entity10 is another significant step forward in the @entity6 programme			1
' building on past experiences we ’ve been able to launch her in the most advanced state of construction of any submarine to be built in @entity4			2
this allows us to now fully concentrate on the test and commissioning activities required to get her to sea			0
' moving a submarine of this size from its build hall to the water is very challenging			2
it ’s testament to the experience and careful planning of the team involved that @entity19 is now ready for the next phase in her programme			0
' witnessing a submarine move out of the hall and be readied for launch is truly inspiring and a source of great pride to the thousands who have played a part in getting @entity19 to this stage			0
' @entity19 will now undergo a series of complex tests to prove the safety and operability of her systems before she departs @entity32 ’ site for sea trials			0
natural habitat : @entity19 got her toes wet for the first time yesterday , 24 hours emerging from the @entity62 in @entity4 , @entity63 final checks : @entity19 will now undergo a series of tests to prove the safety and operability of her systems before she departs @entity32 ' site for sea trials the @entity127 ’s director submarines , rear admiral @entity128 , said : ' the @entity6 programme is making real progress and the sight of the third submarine afloat in the water is a reflection of the hard work of both the @entity127 and industry			1
' the launch of this submarine brings it a step closer to entering into service where it will provide a key capability for the @entity8 and an essential component of the @entity145 into the future			0
' @entity32 , the prime contractor in the @entity6 programme , is the @entity149 's only designer and builder of nuclear powered submarines - one of the most complex engineering programmes in the world today			2
the first two submarines in the @entity6 class – @entity156 and @entity157 – have now been handed over to the @entity149 @entity8 , while the remaining five are in various stages of construction .			1

artful and her sisters in the @entity6 class set a new standard in weapons load and stealth
she will be armed with both @entity21 heavy torpedoes and @entity23 cruise missiles
the new submarine is *covered* with *anti-acoustic* tiles which make her ' *quieter* than a baby dolphin '
