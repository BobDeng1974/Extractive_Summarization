by @entity0 published : 07:20 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 08:22 est , 29 december 2012 it 's the most successful @entity2 video of all time , now even giant pandas are doing their own version of the famous @entity7 dance			0
zoo keepers watched in amazement as @entity10 stood up on his hind legs and assumed a pose with an uncanny resemblance to @entity15 's smash hit routine			1
unfortunately his playmate @entity18 seemed more interested in chewing on bamboo leaves			1
dancing on ice : @entity10 jumps up and assumes the now famous @entity7 pose cool moves : @entity10 gets into the groove at @entity25 's @entity24 in @entity26 , @entity27 parodies of the @entity30 dance have been popping up all over the world as it recently surpassed 1 billion hits			1
so it should n't come as a surprise that those in the animal kingdom are getting in on the act			0
the pair of giant pandas , who moved to @entity25 's @entity24 in @entity26 , @entity27 two years ago , have been spotted copying human behaviour before			0
at the sight of the first snow of the year , @entity18 also jumped up on his hind quarters and started running forward as if looking for a hug			2
this time it was @entity10 who , after twirling around his enclosure several times , padded off looking fairly pleased with himself			0
spectators were delighted by the show and judging by this performance , @entity10 will be expecting the lead bear 's role			2
cold feet : @entity10 limbers up , right , before taking a twirl during his impromptu routine , left @entity10 pads off after strutting his stuff in front of @entity18 looking satisfied with the performance			1

@entity10 strikes up pose that looks just like @entity15 's hit routine
playmate @entity18 *unimpressed* and chews bamboo instead
