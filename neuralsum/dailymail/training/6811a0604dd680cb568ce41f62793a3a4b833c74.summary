this october it will be 12 years since 202 people , including 26 @entity2 , were killed by a terrorist attack in @entity4			1
@entity5 , 41 , from @entity6 , was the only survivor from her group of friends who were at the @entity9 when it was destroyed by bomb blasts			1
@entity5 managed to pull herself out of the rubble but her husband @entity12 , 31 , and her best friend @entity13 , 30 , were n't as lucky			1
recalling the terrible events in 2002 , @entity5 told @entity27 : ' i 'm alive to this day because i did n't get knocked unconscious			1
' i was on the dance floor when there was a massive explosion above the noise of the disco			2
there was a short pause when everyone stood and asked " what was that ? " , then there was another explosion but this time there was a massive flash of yellow light			2
' i was lifted off my feet			2
it was like you see in films , i hit the floor and loads of stuff was falling on top of me			2
i had this moment of sheer terror where i thought " this is it , i 'm dying "			0
loss : @entity5 's first husband , @entity12 , died in the terrorist attack in 2002			1
she set up a charity - @entity24 - in his memory and will raise money for it through her half marathon ' everything was black apart from the flames and i could hear people screaming			1
i was under the corrugated iron part of the roof and i was able to pull it off myself and run up and out			0
' a beam was crushing my right leg but i managed to pull it off by losing my trousers and shoe			0
i ran onto the roof in my halter neck top and all i could see was a wall of fire			0
' i was on fire myself but i made a run for it and reached a cul - de - sac where some guys from a hotel there rushed to help me			0
' @entity5 remained in the cul - de - sac with the other shocked and injured survivors for some time as the night club had collapsed across the road , blocking them in			1
describing the horrific scene , @entity5 said : ' it was awful , there was a guy next to me who had his legs blown off and was writing a letter home to his family			1
' people were trying not to scream and nobody knew what had happened			0
i was able to borrow a mobile phone and call my mum and told her i had lost everyone			2
' i asked her to call @entity13 and @entity12 's mum to find out if they had called			1
' running in their memory : it 's 12 years this october since the bombing in @entity4 which killed 202 people survival : @entity5 managed to pull herself out of the burning building after the roof collapsed on top of her support : @entity5 with her parents @entity112 and @entity113 when she flew back to @entity2 after she spent six weeks in hospital being treated for 43 per cent burns but no - one had heard from either of them and @entity5 feared the worst			1
but she would have to wait five days for confirmation that her husband of five weeks and best friend had died			1
she explained : ' it was chaos afterwards and everyone was sent to different hospitals because the ones in @entity4 could n't cope			1
i was flown to @entity126 and i just kept hoping @entity12 and @entity13 had made it out like i had			1
' but i think i knew the truth in my heart , @entity13 had been right next to me on the dance floor but @entity12 had been closer to the blast			1
' @entity5 and @entity12 had married just five weeks before the attack			1
' i went from an absolute high of getting married to my whole world changing , ' she said			0
the pair had met in @entity4 two years earlier when @entity12 was on a rugby tour and @entity5 was on holiday with friends			1
both were living in @entity140 at the time and they kept their holiday romance going			0
when they returned to @entity4 on the rugby tour the following year , @entity12 proposed			1
as the @entity4 rugby tour had become something of a tradition for them , they decided to return again in 2002 just after they had married			1
in training : @entity5 has run 11 miles in preparation for the race but finds running difficult because of her scars @entity5 said : ' we should n't have gone back to @entity4 but it was the same rugby tour			1
we thought " it 's our place , we should go "			0
it was bad decision as all hell broke lose and everything i knew went wrong			0
' although @entity5 made it out of the burning building alive , she suffered 43 per cent burns to her body			1
she said : ' i was in so much pain i can not describe it			0
imagine what it 's like when you burn your finger on an iron , well 43 per cent of my body was burnt and the other half cut up to patch up the burnt bits			1
' her physical pain made it hard for her to grieve for her dead husband and friends initially			2
she explains : ' it really hurt to cry			0
one of the nurse told me " you have to focus on yourself and getting better			0
grief will come later , you have to dig deep and survive			0
" ' she decided from her hospital bed in @entity126 that she would n't be able to return to the life she shared with @entity12 in @entity140			1
she would instead go back to the @entity2 and threw herself back into her work as a sales trader in @entity21			0
she admits she kept herself busy to put off having to deal with her shock and grief			0
she said : ' i went into overdrive , setting charity up , getting well enough to go back to work			2
i wanted to keep myself so , so busy			0
if i kept myself busy i would n't have to deal with what happened			0
i could n't cope with it so the answer was to keep busy and not think about it			0
' she added : ' it might sound strange but i felt it was unfair that i had survived			2
the weight of distress and upset was so huge , i felt the others had got away lightly			0
they were gone and did n't have to deal with it			0
' eventually @entity5 realised she had to take a step back and process what she had been through			1
she resigned from her job and sought counselling from experts who had supported the survivors of the @entity21 7/7 attacks			0
' someone told me , " you ca n't get your life back exactly how it was , you have to rebuild a new life "			0
so i started looking forward , ' @entity5 said			1
new life : @entity5 is now married to @entity225 and he and their two children will cheer her on on sunday she added that with the support of her friends and family , she was able to accept what had happened and realise she could n't change it			1
towards the end of her counselling , she met @entity235 through mutual friends and they fell in love			0
they married and now have two children , a son , six , and daughter , four			0
@entity5 said : ' i am lucky to have met two amazing guys in my life			1
@entity225 had to take on the history of what happened to me and the charity is still a big part of my life and he 's really supportive of that			2
he 's never been jealous or never thought my scarring was an issue			0
' @entity225 will take the children to cheer @entity5 on as she takes to the streets of @entity21 to run her first ( and she believes last ! ) half marathon next sunday			2
she 's trained for the event by running up to 11 miles but she admits she has n't got the running bug			2
' i hate running to be honest ! ' she said			2
' because of my burns , the left hand side of my body is quite twisted and slightly shorter than the other side so i have been having physio every two to three weeks to combat that			2
after having two children , i also did n't realise my pelvis was out of place so i 've also been having physio for that			0
' i do n't suppose i will be doing another half marathon but i really wanted to do it because it falls on the 12th anniversary			0
