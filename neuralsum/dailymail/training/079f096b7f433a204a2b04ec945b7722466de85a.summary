one in five ‘ suicide tourists ’ going to @entity1 to end their lives is @entity4 , say experts			1
a new study found a doubling of the number of people of all nationalities travelling to @entity11 , an organisation founded in 1998 to help people with terminal and incurable illnesses end their own lives			1
@entity4 make up the second highest number of foreigners going to @entity19 for assisted suicide between 2008 and 2012 – exceeded only by @entity21			1
while euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the @entity4 , other countries , like @entity1 , do permit assisted suicide in specific circumstances - and @entity11 is one of the few to accept foreigners			1
however , @entity4 experts claim there has been little impact in the @entity4 despite increasing numbers seeking help to die abroad			2
the @entity54 produced data on 611 cases of assisted suicide of @entity59 people from 31 countries around the world during the five year period			1
the highest number was 268 @entity21 followed by 126 @entity4 – making two thirds of the total			1
the study , published in the @entity67 , found in 2008 there were 123 cases of suicide tourism			2
this dipped to 86 cases in 2009 and increased steadily to 2012 when it reached 172 cases			0
overall , 58.5 per cent of cases were women and the average age of those using these services was 69 - although the range was from 23 years to 97			0
there are six ‘ right to die ’ organisations operating in @entity1 offering assisted suicide to their members providing they meet certain criteria			2
law : while euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the @entity4 , other countries , like @entity1 , do permit assisted suicide in specific circumstances - and @entity11 is one of the few to accept foreigners ( file photo ) four of these bodies offer services to foreign nationals , including people from the @entity4			1
these organisations deal with around 600 cases of suicide each year , some 150 to 200 of which are suicide tourists , the researchers found			0
most cases of suicide tourism used @entity11 which charges between 9,000 to 10,500 @entity1 francs ( about £ 6,000 to £ 7,000 ) for assisting suicide , says the study			2
neurological diseases including paralysis , motor neurone disease , @entity111 ’s , and multiple sclerosis were the most common reasons for assisted suicide - accounting for almost half of cases			1
dr @entity117 , of @entity118 at @entity119 , in a commentary in the journal , said there may be growing public acknowledgement of something ‘ intellectually , if not morally uncomfortable , about getting another country to do your dirty work ’			0
but , he said , this was not a reason for changing @entity131 law on assisted suicide			2
in the @entity133 , when he presented the @entity136 , @entity137 said ‘ the current situation leaves the rich able to go to @entity1 , the majority reliant on amateur assistance , the compassionate treated like criminals			0
‘ it is time for a change in the law but only a very limited and safeguarded change			0
‘ it would not lead to more death but to less suffering			0
’ the second reading of the @entity147 , which would offer the chance of assisted dying to terminally ill patients deemed mentally capable and within six months of likely death , took place in july and is to be moved to the next parliamentary stage - the committee stage - at a date yet to be set			0
other countries in the top 10 between 2008 and 2012 were @entity156 with 66 cases , @entity158 44 , @entity159 21 , @entity160 14 , @entity161 12 , @entity162 and @entity163 ( eight each ) .			0
