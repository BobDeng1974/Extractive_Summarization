@entity0 are being told to brace for a summer of early and devastating bushfires as figures reveal half the country is at above average risk			1
two years of persistent droughts along the eastern states , coupled with a predicted hot spell for spring and summer , will bring the threat of bushfires forward for much of the eastern seaboard , @entity11 and large parts of @entity13			1
a study published by the @entity16 and @entity15 shows the regions at ' above normal ' risk and the trending weather patterns increasing the bushfire threat			2
in the east of @entity13 , the prevalence of fire is greatest in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 - a state which has been declared 75 per cent drought affected			1
above normal fire potential has been assessed for most of south east @entity36 , from @entity40 in the north west down to the @entity42			2
above average temperatures for @entity34 and @entity35 , and very little rainfall on the horizon for either state could bring a fire season ' slightly more active than 2013 - 14 , ' the centre 's data revealed			0
in @entity34 , the state 's coastal table lands and central slopes have been declared a high - fire danger , while in @entity35 the central @entity55 and @entity56 regions are at risk			0
centre ceo @entity58 said densely populated zones in dry forested areas that have received little rain will be worse affected			2
' the forested area in the east - that covers southern @entity36 , most of eastern @entity34 and down through into @entity35 - is largely driven by rainfall deficits over a long period of time , ' centre ceo @entity58 said			2
' that is leading to much higher than normal levels of potential for fire in the coming year			0
' @entity0 should brace for ' above normal ' bushfire threats in large parts of the country bushfires could come earlier than they did in 2013 - the warmest @entity0 year on record planning for the bushfire season can never start to early he said it is unlikely that even big rain events like those experienced in @entity36 and @entity34 in recent weeks will alter the outlook			1
' we 'll always get rainfall somewhere			0
what it will do is delay the onset a bit in general , but a few good , hot days will dry that out , ' he said			0
in @entity13 's less populated regions , higher - than - average rainfall has increased the risk of grass fires on the @entity92 , in the mid-west and desert @entity89 and @entity11 's @entity95			1
' the south central parts of @entity13 , through the midwest and the desert region , is dominated by a fairly wet period that has caused the grass to grow in this area			1
' dr @entity58 urged @entity0 to prepare now for the bushfire season			1
' it 's never too early to start to prepare , ' he said			1
there is physical preparation that you can do and there is a bunch of other things you can do like your fire plans			0
' make sure you 've got them written down , know what you are going to do if a fire threatens , no what your triggers are going to be			0
' @entity116 : strong winter grass growth , predicted above average spring temperatures and lower recent rainfall suggest above normal bushfire risk			1
@entity34 : well below average rain and warm temperatures to august drying heavy forest fuels but reducing grass growth			1
dry , warm spring expected in south			0
above normal fire conditions expected in the east			2
@entity36 : drought has curbed grass grown and grass fire risk but forest fuels are drying out			0
above normal fire potential in much of southeast			0
@entity11 : increased grass fire risk in parts of north west pastoral , west coast , eastern and lower @entity95 , @entity139 and mid-north with grass growth from above average rain			1
@entity144 : above normal potential for fires expected only in @entity150 / @entity149 / @entity148 region			0
@entity35 : above average fire risk expected in much of central , north and western @entity35			0
early and slightly more active fire season than last summer expected			0
@entity13 : low rain , dry soil and high fuel loads increases fire risk in southwest forests			1
above average rain in the mid-west , south and desert regions produce higher grass fire potential .			2

a lack of rain and warm conditions will fuel bushfires along the east coast
in @entity13 , recent rain will *provide* fuel for the grass fires to burn increase
experts have warned that fires are likely to start earlier than previous years
the *research* is contained in a regional bushfire report for @entity13
the *message* to @entity0 is to prepare ahead of the bushfire threats
