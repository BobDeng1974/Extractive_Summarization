the boss of the @entity2 's biggest taxi firm apologised today for comparing a deaf footballer who ' grunts ' during matches to female tennis players			1
@entity9 chairman and leading @entity11 donor @entity8 appeared to crack the joke at the expense of @entity15 ’s deaf footballer @entity14			1
the non-league striker was abused by @entity18 fans in a midweek match last month for the way he communicates with his team - mates			2
anger : @entity8 , left , waded into a row about deaf footballer @entity14 , right , and seemed to mock the way he communicated with team - mates police were called when some of the fans started making loud grunting noises mocking the way he gets the attention of his fellow players			1
@entity33 was said to be ' very upset ' about being abused on the pitch			2
the striker , who has one child , declined to comment directly , but his club manager @entity37 said : ' @entity14 has told me he is very upset about what has happened			2
' he has been a bit more introverted over the last couple of weeks			0
he is going away for a long weekend with his partner and child which will do him good			0
' i signed @entity14 from @entity45 , he is a good player			1
' i am just so bored of this type of behaviour in this day and age - it is 2012 we should have moved on			0
' the 69 - year - old mini cab boss involved in the row by sending an e-mail from his @entity54 account to his local paper comparing the noises made by @entity33 to those of female tennis stars , such as @entity59			1
controversial : an e-mail sent from @entity54 boss @entity8 to the @entity61 regarding @entity15 's deaf striker @entity14 his comments were made public sparking anger from charities , and today he issued an apology for causing any offence			1
he said : ' i regret any offence caused by my comments			0
this was certainly not my intention and i apologise			0
' @entity59 has reached levels of 101 decibels , which is the equivalent of an aeroplane landing while other female tennis stars such as @entity77 have also been accused of making a lot of noise while playing			1
@entity77 ' grunt is more low pitched than @entity59 's but is still the equivalent noise level as a jackhammer , at 88.9 decibels			0
mr @entity8 , who lives in a luxury house in @entity15 and is believed to be worth £ 50million , sent the e-mail to the @entity61 news reporter @entity85 who reported on the original story			1
making a racket : female tennis players @entity59 and @entity77 have two of the loudest grunts in the game			1
@entity92 has been recorded reaching 101 decibels , the same as an aeroplane landing in the e-mail he said the police at the ground should have ‘ demanded ’ the profoundly - deaf player ‘ discontinue ’ the way he communicates			1
he also said : ‘ i long ago gave up watching women ’s tennis due to the loud and [ un ] acceptable level of grunting			2
' i note that the police were called and i hope they demanded that the footballer should discontinue making noises that could be misinterpreted by members of the crowd			1
' and now @entity110 has now slammed both his astonishing e-mail and the sick taunts made by some of @entity18 football fans			1
@entity121 , the charity ’s head of pr and campaigns , said : ‘ we are very disappointed by the reported lack of deaf awareness shown by a section of the supporters and hope , in future , they show more respect to a talented footballer who is trying to overcome communication barriers during matches			1
not happy : @entity132 manager @entity37 spoke on behalf of @entity14 who expressed how upset he was ' we are also extremely concerned by the comments made by mr @entity8 and expect they will be seen as a spectacular own goal by many of his company ’s customers who are deaf or hard of hearing			1
' meanwhile a spokeswoman for @entity54 said : ' our chairman has apologised for the comments made and for any offence that has been caused			0
' @entity54 is an equal opportunities employer and we are strongly committed to employing disabled people as is demonstrated through our membership of the ' two ticks ' scheme			0
' @entity33 was subjected to the taunts when he came on as a 66th minute sub during the home game on october 23 , which @entity18 won 2 - 0			2
police were called but left shortly afterwards when it appeared that the abuse had stopped			2
and @entity156 , 61 , chairman of @entity158 's @entity157 , described the abuse from the away fans as ' unacceptable '			0
he said : ' we are not happy at all with the behaviour on that day			0
the incident has gone to the @entity164 and we hope they will deal with it seriously			0
this is an issue that needs to be discussed - it is unacceptable to abuse any players			0
' mr @entity8 is entitled to have his say , but imagine if we had all laughed at disabled athletes at the @entity173			2
' it does not matter what noises @entity14 makes on the pitch , the only important thing is that he is a good footballer			1
' it is not the first time that mr @entity8 has been involved in a controversy , back in april he told his drivers to break the law by using bus lanes in @entity183			2
under orders : @entity54 drivers were told by mr @entity8 to drive in @entity183 's bus lanes - despite the fact it is illegal the self - made top @entity11 donor and father - of - two also lost a money - spinning £ 4million government contract the same month in a bitter cash row			1
mr @entity8 , who founded @entity54 in @entity194 , south @entity183 , in 1975 with one car , also infuriated the city ’s tens of thousands of cyclists in april			2
the private @entity199 chairman wrote in his in - house magazine add @entity202 : ‘ these cyclists are throwing themselves on to some of the most congested spaces in the world			0
' they leap on to a vehicle which offers them no protection except a padded plastic hat			0
' should a motorist fail to observe a granny wobbling to avoid a pothole or rain drain , then he is guilty of failing to anticipate that this was somebody on her maiden voyage into the abyss			0
' the fact is he just did n't see her and however cautious , caring or alert he is , the influx of beginner cyclists is going to lead to an overall increase in accidents involving cyclists			0
' @entity54 carries a up to 10million passengers a year as well as making 1million courier deliveries .			0
