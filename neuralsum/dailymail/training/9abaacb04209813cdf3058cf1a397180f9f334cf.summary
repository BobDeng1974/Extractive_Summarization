with body beautiful celebrities adorning the covers of all our favourite magazines , it is no surprise that we have become a society obsessed with image			0
and as celebrities become seemingly more slender with every passing day , more of us than ever are turning to liposuction for a helping hand - and that includes celebrities such as @entity14 and @entity15 , who have publicly endorsed new , less invasive forms of fat removal			2
now , according to the latest statistics , liposuction has now become the most popular treatment in the world			1
in demand : according to the latest statistics , liposuction has become the most popular treatment in the world figures released this month from the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) reveal that liposuction was the most heavily requested treatment in the world			1
and it seems that people are so keen to seek out the best possible treatment that they are prepared to travel to find the newest and most effective methods - with @entity34 tipped as the best place to come for fat removal			2
one @entity34 clinic has reported a 35 per cent rise in enquiries for their minimally invasive liposuction technique , driven in part by an increase in overseas visitors travelling to the capital for their treatments			1
in 2012 the private clinic on @entity48 experienced a 34.9 per cent increase in enquiries for @entity52 liposuction and @entity53 – both forms of minimally invasive liposuction – compared to 2011			0
famous fans : made in @entity57 's @entity15 had a lipoglaze treatment to target her hips , where she struggled to shift the excess fat the @entity47 ’s chief medical officer , dr @entity62 , believes the trend will continue into 2013 , saying : ' in the last few months alone i have treated a number of patients who have flown in from countries such as @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and the @entity72			1
' these patients are willing to travel thousands of miles to @entity34 , in the knowledge that they will receive the very latest techniques and technologies , delivered by some of the best practitioners in the industry			0
' @entity80 , which involves removing fat from around the underlying musculature and thus producing a more sculpted result , is particularly popular with patients from overseas			0
freezing the fat : former @entity86 @entity14 is a big fan of the @entity87 treatment which can be done on her lunchbreak ' the number of experienced practitioners offering @entity92 internationally is , relatively speaking , very low and therefore patients seeking the treatment often have no choice but to travel			1
' of course the fact that treatments such as this can be delivered by specialist practitioners in @entity34 , makes it even more accessible for these international patients			0
' the internet also means that patients can research clinics and doctors from all over the world , and are therefore not restricted to the expertise readily available in their own geographical area			1
' according to dr @entity62 the type of individual expressing an interest in this form of specialist liposuction technique has also changed : ' now i see a far greater number of men coming in for @entity52 lipo than ever before			2
honed to perfection : 54 - year - old @entity121 underwent a new type of lipo called @entity52 so that he could keep up with his 33 - year - old girlfriend proving how men are fans too ' and while some five or so years ago the majority of men i treated were in their thirties , now i ’m seeing an increasing number of men in their 50s and 60s who , despite leading active , healthy lifestyles , are unable to maintain the bodies that they had when they were younger			0
' for these men , @entity52 helps to ensure that they can continue to look good later into life and they are willing to travel long distances to be treated			0
