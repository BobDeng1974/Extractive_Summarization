in four minutes of playing time against @entity0 , @entity1 contributed more to the excitement of a goalless draw than almost anyone else			1
it took roughly the same amount of time for @entity8 to explain he will take personal responsibility if this comeback is rushed and ends in yet more pain for the striker			0
it ’s been easy to forget over the five months since @entity1 tore ligaments in his left ankle — and @entity16 found an exciting attack pair in his absence — that he can cause mayhem with correct service			1
@entity1 was all smiles as he returned to the @entity16 bench for the first time this season alongside @entity25 ( left ) @entity1 replaces team - mate @entity26 for @entity16 to make his first appearance of the season @entity29 provided that on saturday as @entity1 made his first appearance since a pre-season tour of @entity33 ended with a flight to the @entity35 for surgery			1
his cameo was brief but dramatic as he dominated @entity0 in the air			0
a draw breaks @entity0 ’s streak of six defeats , yielding their first point since september 13			2
the challenge now will be his slow reintegration , with @entity8 estimating it could be as many as six games before the 25 - year - old is fully fit			1
‘ @entity1 is five or six games away from being fit , ’ @entity8 said			1
‘ he is in the ( equivalent of ) first throes of pre-season			0
‘ it will take strength of mind as we must not think he is ready now , which he will do because all players do			0
the towering forward gets up highest to fire in a header at the @entity0 goal towards the closing stages of the game @entity16 boss @entity8 will not be rushing @entity1 back after a quicker than expected recovery ' it is me having a firm sense of mind by saying , “ you are in pre-season , if i bring you on any quicker and you get injured again then that will be my fault ”			1
‘ i am not willing to do that because the squad we have is working fantastically well			0
’ @entity8 provided a compelling insight into the battle @entity1 has endured since suffering his second major injury in just 18 months			2
he said : ‘ i remember him in @entity33 , really distressed , and then flying to @entity77 to get the repair			0
‘ that decision was made swiftly so @entity1 had the op in a few days and he is probably back sooner than expected .			2
