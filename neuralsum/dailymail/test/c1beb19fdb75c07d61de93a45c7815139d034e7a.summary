do n't be fooled , @entity0			0
do n’t be caught out by this impressive run of form and think everything is in place for a crack at the title next year			2
it is not uncommon to see @entity8 finish a season with a string of good results			1
usually they rattle out a sequence of wins just in time to preserve their place in the top four but too late to affect the destiny of the @entity17			1
the same thing has happened this year			2
@entity19 were relentless from the first whistle and have had the title race firmly under control since before @entity23			1
@entity8 players celebrate after their extra-time winner against @entity26 in the @entity28 semi-finals last week @entity29 jumps in the air and celebrates wildly after his second goal for @entity8 at @entity32 with a 10 - point advantage , even if @entity34 loses to @entity35 for the first time on sunday it wo n’t stop his side becoming champions			1
next year , though , @entity19 wo n’t have it all their own way and no team is better placed than @entity8 to dislodge them			1
there is a different feel to their form and performances this time around and @entity35 said recently he could ‘ smell ’ something happening			0
you just hope , however , @entity35 and @entity8 ’s board do n’t get fooled into thinking they have got all the tools they need at their disposal			2
this is not the time to be complacent			0
this is the summer when @entity8 must go for it and make the big additions that will stop them being nearly - men			1
that is exactly what @entity19 did 12 months ago			1
after finishing behind @entity62 and @entity63 , @entity34 did n’t mess around			2
in came @entity65 , who had spearheaded @entity68 ’s @entity67 success , and a @entity70 winner in @entity71			0
the money was big but the quality was proven and , after they were unveiled , everyone began tipping @entity19 for the title			1
we might be doing the same with @entity8 come august if @entity35 , who has been criticised for spending @entity8 ’s money like it ’s his own , is similarly ambitious			2
@entity8 , it should be stressed , are not in need of major surgery and the spine of their team is now much stronger than at any point last season , when they only just held off @entity89 ’s challenge to finish fourth			1
but there is still room for improvement			0
@entity8 manager @entity35 talks to his players ahead of extra time at @entity32 last saturday @entity19 manager @entity34 looks in fine form during a press conference on friday results have been impressive since @entity98 replaced @entity99 , who had failed to show the required consistency			1
@entity98 has played 12 @entity17 games ; @entity8 have won 11 and he has kept six clean sheets , but @entity35 still needs to buy a new no 1 if they are to be title challengers			1
@entity105 would be an ideal candidate to come in			0
@entity106 has steadied things in defence , with @entity8 winning 15 of the 18 games he ’s played since january 1 but , to progress , @entity35 needs another top centre back			1
@entity112 arrived in the @entity113 but it seems it was to provide cover for @entity106 and @entity116			0
@entity117 has added bite to the midfield , but would @entity8 have enough to challenge next season if @entity117 is their anchor and @entity122 is his back up ? no. why does n’t he go for @entity125 , who looks set to leave @entity126 ? @entity35 spent £ 42m on @entity127 , so why not spend the same and more on @entity125			1
if they needed to sign @entity127 two years ago , their need to sign @entity125 this summer is even greater			2
@entity131 of @entity68 is 29 and at the peak of his powers			0
he would be ideal at the heart of the defence			0
@entity8 goalkeeper @entity98 pictured during a training session at @entity137 last week @entity19 goalkeeper @entity105 warms up before saturday 's @entity17 clash against @entity139 @entity140 , meanwhile , has provided a focal point up front			1
he is an under - rated striker and , had he not missed three months with a broken ankle , his tally would be more than 14 ; he averages a goal every 101.93 minutes , the second best rate in the @entity17			1
@entity140 is one of a number of good options @entity35 has up front			2
@entity29 has been brilliant , while @entity149 has played his part , but that should not stop wenger looking to improve on what he has got			2
if a forward with the class of players he has had before , such as @entity157 or @entity158 , comes on the market , @entity35 would have to move for him			0
imagine what @entity160 , @entity161 or @entity162 could do for @entity8 ? i ’m not saying @entity8 are getting to the levels of ‘ @entity166 ’ but their form has me thinking they are getting closer			2
the 2 - 0 win at @entity62 in january could be a turning point			0
they made themselves difficult to beat rather than being open			0
hopefully we will see more of this			0
@entity8 's @entity173 striker @entity140 looks forward as he advances with the ball at @entity32 @entity149 ( left ) looks to evade the challenge of @entity26 's @entity176 ( centre ) and @entity178 of course it has been frustrating that they have not challenged for the title since last winning it 11 years ago , and @entity35 has not had a smooth ride			1
fans turned on him after they lost at @entity184 — and after the @entity186 defeat to @entity187 — leading to talk about @entity188 coming in			0
but some perspective is needed			0
@entity35 has done a good job keeping @entity8 consistently in the top four — all their rivals have dropped out at some point in between — and by the end of next month , they could have won back - to - back @entity196			1
how could you then get rid of @entity35 ? so one question would need asking : what are they waiting for ? both @entity202 clubs will spend in the summer , but both those clubs have got far more problems to fix			2
@entity62 ’s squad is old and needs big investment , while @entity139 will have the complication of being back in @entity208			0
@entity35 , then , could use the next window to call it on			0
the message it would send out to his players , fans and , most significantly , their rivals would be huge			0
it would let everyone know they were launching an all - out assault on the title			0
they would have to be taken seriously			0
beating @entity19 on sunday wo n’t alter things in the short term , but it will offer belief that @entity8 can challenge next season			1
what they do in the window will determine how big a statement they can make			2
finding some special players could transform them			0
@entity228 head coach @entity188 celebrates after beating @entity229 last weekend @entity35 applauds the @entity8 fans after his side booked their place in the @entity28 final big guns missed out on a fab freebie full marks to @entity237			1
they are a side rejuvenated by @entity240 and absolutely deserved to beat @entity63 in the @entity28 semi-final			0
@entity242 understandably attracted most of the headlines for his outstanding performance but the role @entity246 played was just as important ; his aggression , energy and left foot gives @entity237 balance in their midfield			1
@entity63 could n’t cope with his aggression			0
earlier this season , @entity246 was lauded for committing his future to @entity237 even when their position in the @entity17 was threatened			1
he signed a four - year deal , which showed his character could never be called into question			0
what can be called into question , however , is the wisdom of some other clubs in the @entity17			1
@entity246 ( right ) celebrates after scoring for @entity237 against @entity63 in the @entity28 semis @entity246 , do not forget , was set to be out of contract this summer and a number of sides at the top of the table had their chance to sign a young @entity269 international for free			1
no doubt these same clubs will go out when the window opens and bring in at least one foreign midfielder , to go with the ones they signed last summer , and soon enough we will hear at some point next season that we do n’t have enough @entity280 players playing for top sides competing in @entity208			1
there will then be complaints from clubs saying it is impossible to buy @entity280 players because there is such a premium on them and they will argue that is why they are forced to look abroad for new signings			0
the @entity246 situation shows that sometimes such an argument is nonsense			2
he is now @entity237 ’s captain and has been their best player for the last 18 months			1
his progress has been so impressive he is now a regular in the @entity269 squad and if he can add more goals to his game — like the one he scored against @entity63 — he could reach a very high level			0
@entity246 slots the ball past @entity63 goalkeeper @entity301 in @entity237 's 2 - 1 victory at @entity32 if @entity246 does maintain his improvement , inevitably clubs will come looking at him			1
but if they want him , it will cost			0
for reasons only they know , they let slip a chance to get something good for nothing			2
their loss is most certainly @entity237 ’s gain .			2

it is not *unusual* to see @entity8 finish the season with good results
@entity8 host @entity19 at the @entity320 on sunday
an @entity8 win will not stop @entity19 from becoming champions
@entity19 will not have it all their own way in the @entity17 next year
no team is better placed than @entity8 to dislodge @entity34 's side
@entity8 must go for it this summer and make the big additions
@entity246 has been @entity237 's best player for the last 18 months
other @entity17 clubs missed their chance to sign @entity246 for free
