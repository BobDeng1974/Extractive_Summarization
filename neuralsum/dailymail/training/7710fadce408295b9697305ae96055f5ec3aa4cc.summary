homeowner @entity8 , 41 , had been arrested after career criminal @entity9 , 37 , suffered up to nine knife wounds as he broke into @entity8 's luxury four bedroom home in @entity13 , near @entity14 , @entity15			1
during the raid , @entity9 and an accomplice held a knife to the throat of a terrified mr @entity8 saying : ' we will f * * * * * * slit your throat , get your money , get your jewellery - we will kill you			1
' they then frogmarched him upstairs to his study and then to his kitchen in a search for jewellery and a large quantity of cash			2
@entity8 , pictured with his wife @entity32 , killed burglar @entity9 in a knife fight in 2011			1
he has been vindicated of any wrongdoing by a coroner today but when the victim ’s wife @entity32 , 36 , and 14 - year - old son @entity38 returned home from a football tournament , mr @entity8 grabbed a carving knife from the kitchen and repeatedly stabbed @entity9 during a violent struggle			1
mr @entity8 - who said he acted in lawful self defence - was questioned for 12 hours and later released without charge , but was kept on bail for almost a month until he was told he would not be charged			1
he and his family have been forced to quit their luxury home due to them suffering nightmares about the tragedy almost 18 months ago			2
@entity9 ( left ) was stabbed to death by @entity8 while carrying out a break - in at mr @entity8 's home in @entity13 , @entity56			1
his father @entity57 ( right ) pictured outside @entity58 for today 's inquest it emerged the raiders had been given information about mr @entity8 ’s safe from the victim ’s uncle who helped him run a transport storage firm			1
last year @entity9 ’s accomplice @entity67 , 34 , of @entity68 , @entity14 , @entity15 , was jailed for ten years after admitting aggravated burglary			1
the coroner @entity70 backed mr @entity8 after hearing him insist he used reasonable force against the burglar at an inquest into @entity9 ’s death amid a large police security operation at @entity14 coroners court			1
mr @entity70 also dismissed attempts by @entity67 to smear mr @entity8 ’s integrity after the thug was brought from jail to give evidence			1
burglar @entity67 was jailed for ten years after a bungled raid in which homeowner @entity8 stabbed @entity67 's accomplice @entity9 to death during a struggle recording a narrative verdict the coroner said : ' @entity8 was terrified by the two men , both of them had knives and we know that a knife was found on mr @entity9			1
' @entity8 , inside his own home , is entitled to be very fearful and entitled to use reasonable and appropriate force to protect him family and his property			1
' i note that he and mr @entity9 were having a knife fight and he was fighting for his life			1
i also note that mr @entity9 obtained nine knife wounds and @entity8 only one			1
' mr @entity9 had a considerable amount of drugs including alcohol in his system and you could see how this could make him react			1
' one thing is certain is that it would have had an affect on slowing his reactions and making it more difficult to strike and defend himself as a sober man would and this would account for the disparity of injuries			0
' i have little doubt that mr @entity9 went with mr @entity67 to commit a burglary or robbery , equipped and prepared to use a knife or knives to threaten @entity8 and his family			1
' the householder is entitled to use reasonable force to defend himself			0
' the tragedy occurred in september 2011 when mr @entity8 , who had been at his £ 350,000 home watching tv , answered a knock at his front door there stood a man in a high - visibility jacket claimed to be from the gas board , but @entity9 and @entity67 suddenly burst in			1
mr @entity8 , a former director of a delivery firm , said : ' i thought @entity32 had forgotten her keys and i put on a daft voice saying : " who is it ? "			1
then i could make out high - vis colours and a voice replied back " gas "			2
i had no reason to doubt that they were not officials but the door flew open so much so that i flew backwards and two men rushed in and shouted " customs "			2
' one had a blue - coloured clipboard and tried to pretend it was formal paperwork , when i tried to say " can i have a look a that " and see some identification they said , " no , you are being robbed mate "			2
' they both pulled out knives and grabbed hold of me on either side and that was it i was under their control			0
scene of ordeal : mr @entity8 was confronted on his doorstep by two thugs who then forced their way into his home in the @entity56 stockbroker belt last year security : there was a large police presence outside @entity58 for the inquest into the death of burglar @entity9 ' their first words once they dropped the act were " no police , no alarms or you are dead			1
where is your wife and son ? give us your money , give us your jewellery , the @entity182 "			0
’ ' they pulled the knives from their midriffs and brandished them throughout , they shouted " upstairs upstairs "			0
' one was on my left , the other on my right with the knives at the side of my throat , being frogmarched			0
' i tried telling them several times that i had no money and pointed out that i was just a van driver			0
they were demanding £ 40,000 , i did n’t have any money			0
' ' they said : " we know you have money , we have paid for this information we will f * * * * * * slit your throat , get your money , get your jewellery , we will kill you , we will kill you "			0
' i suppose anyone going past our home might think we were well off but that was far from the truth , we were an average family earning average wages and paying off a mortgage			2
conspirator : @entity67 arriving at @entity58 in handcuffs ' i pleaded with them to leave , i said my wife and kid would be back shortly			2
i thought if i told them they would have some humanity			0
' he told them that there was a safe downstairs but there was nothing in it			0
he was forced back downstairs at knifepoint , while @entity67 was upstairs			1
in his statement mr @entity8 said that he went back to the kitchen and he glanced to the left and he saw his wife in the kitchen doorway			1
her sudden appearance shocked @entity9			2
mr @entity8 said : ' he did n’t know what to do at first and looked at @entity32 and then looked at me and lunged at me with the knife he had			1
' i grabbed a knife from the block in the kitchen and ran at him and knocked him to the ground			0
it was the closest thing to me			0
' i barged at him , i did n’t stab him straight away			0
i tried to disarm him but as we crashed into the hallway , i remember thinking : " you need to get to your feet "			0
' it was a matter of who could get to their feet first , we both got up			0
' it was a knife fight then , who could stab each other first , we were both brandishing knives at each other			0
' he was stabbing with his knife and i was stabbing with mine , we were both just basically trying to stab each other			0
it was a knife fight and it was horrible			0
' i felt if i was n’t quicker than him he would stab and kill me			0
i did n’t know where my wife and son were			0
' then i heard her screaming and at first i thought @entity67 had thrown @entity38 into the back of the van because it drove off at speed			2
' @entity9 suffered superficial wounds to his arm , wrist and knee but sustained a fatal wound to his thigh which severed a vital artery			2
he bled to death whilst attempting to flee the scene			0
tests showed he had traces in his bloodstream of alcohol , methadone , morphine , codeine , cocaine , diazepam , caffeine and nicotine			0
he had previously been on heroin			0
the villain had dozens of convictions for burglary , robbery and theft and once served an 18 - month prison sentence for beating a man unconscious and leaving him looking ' like a piece of meat '			2
during the hearing mr @entity8 dismissed as ' ludicrous ' claims @entity67 had visited the house previously			1
