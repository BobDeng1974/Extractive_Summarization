other complaints , about which few details have been disclosed , concern toy safety , the cleanliness of beaches , the energy performance of buildings and vehicles nearing their ‘ end of life ’			0
details of the 47 legal actions , obtained under freedom of information laws from the @entity49 , will fuel the fierce debate about @entity3 ’s role in @entity52			0
