@entity1 foreign minister @entity0 has attracted both criticism and applause for her controversial decision to wear a headscarf during her visit to @entity7			1
@entity0 , who is @entity1 's highest - ranking official to visit @entity7 in 12 years , donned a black headscarf during a meeting with @entity7 president @entity10 and her @entity7 counterpart @entity11			2
social media lit up as those from both sides of the argument weighed in on whether @entity0 was right to cover her head in keeping with local custom , while political commentators and politicians have also voiced their opinions			1
' i 'm not religious but i am respectful			0
i do n't like @entity0 but i 'm glad she respected @entity7 and their culture , ' @entity50 added			2
while westerners are not required by law to cover their heads , the foreign minister said she did so out of respect for the culture			1
' when i went for an audience with the @entity62 , they told me i had to wear a scarf , ' the foreign minister told the @entity1			1
' so i wore a scarf			0
you respect the culture wherever you are			0
' criticism : @entity68 attracted criticism for refusing to cover her head at the funeral of @entity73 â€™s @entity72 in january neither @entity74 nor @entity75 were veiled for their trips to the @entity78 during their tenures as @entity81 secretary of state , except for when visiting mosques			1
' i support @entity0 wearing a head scarf while overseas ... but saying that it 's part of her daily outfit though , not so much , ' wrote @entity87 on @entity46			2
the tweet was in reference to an earlier comment given by @entity0 to @entity92 , in which she appeared to deny her ensemble was purely political			2
' as a matter of fact i wear scarves and hats and headgear quite often as part of my everyday wear , ' @entity0 said			2
the hat and scarf combo @entity0 later donned also attracted a number of unfortunate comparisons to @entity40 on social media			1
opinion : views on @entity46 were divided ... while some just liked the sartorial style @entity7 journalist and founder of facebook page ' my @entity113 , @entity114 , wrote a post calling for the foreign minister to raise the issue of the compulsory wearing of a hijab for women in @entity7			1
' madam @entity0 was asked not to give in to the compulsory veil and to raise her voice very much like numerous @entity7 women who have started doing so , ' @entity114 wrote on @entity124			2
' we also asked the @entity1 foreign minister to ask the officials of the @entity128 to respect her personal values and not to impose the compulsory veil on @entity7 women			1
' @entity7 journalist @entity114 wrote a post on her @entity124 group ' my @entity113 ' calling for the foreign minister to raise the issue of the compulsory wearing of a hijab for women in @entity7 during her visit meanwhile opposition leader @entity140 waded into the debate , following @entity143 's comments that @entity0 should have ' stood up for @entity145 values ' and that she looked ' ridiculous '			1
' i think it 's ridiculous to criticise @entity0 for wearing a headscarf in @entity7 , ' mr @entity140 said			1
' would they criticise @entity0 if she wore a scarf to meet the pope ? if i wore a yarmulke in @entity152 to certain events , i do n't think that would be inappropriate			0
' what really matters here is regardless of @entity161 or @entity162 , that our representatives when they go overseas behave in a sensible , non-ideological , pragmatic fashion			0
going bare : @entity74 did not don a scarf during her visit to @entity73 as secretary of state in 2012 ... nor did @entity75 during her visit in 2007 ' it just makes common sense that when you go to someone 's house , or indeed someone 's nation , you 're just a bit respectful of the customs and traditions of the place that you 're visiting			0
' on saturday @entity0 hailed @entity7 's efforts to crush the jihadist @entity180 group in @entity181 , saying on a rare trip to @entity183 that the militants can be defeated			2
@entity1 is part of an international coalition in @entity181 and has 500 troops deployed there			0
@entity7 , though not part of the coalition , has run a parallel campaign using @entity191 militias and military advisers to reverse the is surge that came close to felling the @entity195 government last june			0
' we are witnessing a more complex and dangerous form of terrorism with @entity199 , ' @entity0 said at a joint press conference , using an @entity202 acronym to refer to the militant group			0
the foreign minister met with president @entity10 in @entity183 on saturday ' both countries can contribute in the fight against this terrorist organisation and put an end to the misery of the people in @entity181 , ' she said , referring to @entity7 and @entity1 's efforts			1
@entity181 needs ' a strong and stable government ' added @entity0 , who along with @entity11 said @entity1 and @entity7 were in @entity181 at the request of the @entity195 government in fighting @entity216			0
' the fight against @entity199 and terrorism in @entity181 should be managed by the @entity181 government , ' @entity11 said			0
' anything we do in @entity181 is in coordination with the @entity181 government			0
' from @entity7 , the foreign minister travels to @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226			1
