families may have been overcharged £ 150 for their electricity bills , but it is hard to tell because the market is so complex , according to a senior figure at the energy regulator			1
@entity6 , a senior partner at @entity7 , was asked to respond to new figures from @entity9 suggesting the major energy suppliers had charged customers an average of £ 150 too much over the past three years			1
but he suggested it was not possible to establish whether this was the case , saying : ‘ what was identified in our work is that there is actually not enough transparency to be able to actually look at that			0
’ families may have been overcharged £ 150 for their electricity bills , but it is hard to tell because the market is so complex , according to a senior figure at the energy regulator he said the regulator was ‘ looking into it ’ and was in the process of enacting major reforms which would make the market simpler for consumers to understand			1
mr @entity6 conceded there ‘ was n’t enough trading going on ’ in the energy market but said the reforms would introduce more competition by helping independent suppliers break into the marketplace			1
@entity9 have accused the so - called @entity39 energy giants , who supply electricity to 98 per cent of the country , of buying power from their own stations and then charging their customers over the market rate			2
@entity48 energy spokesman @entity47 said their analysis of official figures suggested the firms were ripping off customers to the tune of nearly £ 4billion to boost profits			1
the research compared the prices at which these firms bought their electricity with those of the small supplier @entity60 , and found it was higher			0
if the firms did sell to each other at an inflated price , they could stand accused of misleading @entity65 because power company bosses who gave evidence to mps last year claimed they only ‘ self - supply ’ a small amount of electricity or none at all			2
miss @entity47 said : ‘ these figures reveal the full extent of the way consumers have been overcharged for their electricity			2
energy companies always blame wholesale costs when they put up bills , but it now looks like they ’ve deliberately inflated prices to boost profits from their power stations			0
‘ the regulator @entity7 has serious questions to answer about why it has failed to monitor the way in which companies have bought electricity from themselves and why it has allowed these companies to overcharge their customers			2
’ @entity48 energy minister @entity89 added : ‘ it is just not good enough for @entity7 to say it does n’t know whether consumers are being overcharged – it ’s the regulator ’s job to know			1
’ @entity6 , a senior partner at @entity7 , was asked to respond to new figures from @entity9 suggesting the major energy suppliers had charged customers an average of £ 150 too much over the past three years a few hours after mr @entity6 ’s comment on @entity100 ’s today programme , @entity7 released a statement saying they did not believe the @entity39 firms were overcharging customers as @entity9 claimed			1
an @entity7 spokesman said they had not seen details of @entity9 ’s analysis , and ‘ would clearly consider more detailed information ’ from them in their next report			0
but he said : ‘ @entity7 regularly looks at the relationship between wholesale and retail prices and our own analysis of the evidence does not support this allegation			0
where we have found evidence that firms have not played by the rules we have acted			0
since 2010 we have imposed over £ 75million of penalties and redress payments on the industry			0
’ all of the @entity39 firms raised gas and electricity prices for customers by up to 10 per cent at the end of last year			0
energy @entity128 , representing the @entity39 , said suppliers pay ‘ the most competitive price they can for the gas and electricity they purchase ’ and claimed @entity9 ’s figures ‘ do n’t give the true picture ’ .			1

@entity6 said it was *n't* ' transparent ' whether customers overcharged
he said regulator was ‘ looking into it ’ and in process of major reforms
it *'s* claimed major energy suppliers overcharged customers £ 150
