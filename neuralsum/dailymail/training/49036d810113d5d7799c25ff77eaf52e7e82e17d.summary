in 1945 , @entity79 was captured and returned to @entity2 , where he was later hanged			0
mr @entity10 said he would raise the issue with home secretary @entity93 , adding : ‘ we have had a discussion about the allegiance question			1
we have seen people declaring that they have sworn personal allegiance to the so - called @entity15			0
that does raise questions about their loyalty and allegiance to this country and about whether the offence of treason could have been committed			2
’ supporters of the idea believe it would act as a deterrent to so - called ‘ gap - year jihadists ’ attracted by the idea of fighting in @entity4 , as well as taking dangerous individuals off the streets			2

’ ministers last considered reviving the treason laws almost a decade ago to deal with the threats posed by @entity113 hate preachers			1
but the idea was eventually shelved			0
suspected extremists are being arrested at the rate of nearly one a day , @entity2 ’s counter terrorism chief revealed last night			0
assistant commissioner @entity178 said police are mounting an ‘ exceptionally high ’ number of operations to thwart terror plots inspired by groups in @entity4 and @entity3			0
