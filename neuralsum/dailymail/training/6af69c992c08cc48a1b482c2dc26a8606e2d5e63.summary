a private native american school in @entity1 has been exposed fabricating ' sob stories ' of disadvantaged and displaced children in order to appeal for charity donations and handouts - and collecting millions of dollars while doing so			1
@entity7 - a 200 - person boarding school in @entity8 - collected over $ 50 million in fundraising last year using a national marketing campaign that involves mailing ' help packets ' all over the country			1
the packets feature children apparently in need , such as one little boy , @entity16 , who says his father gets drunk and beats him and ' mom chose drugs over me '			2
however the children are not real , a @entity22 investigation has discovered			2
' they are raising money in the name of @entity51 , using the worst of poverty porn of all @entity51 country to raise money on all our social ills , ' @entity46 , president of the @entity47 , told @entity22			1
@entity58 , vice chairman of the nearby @entity60 reservation in central @entity1 , said the mail packets are a scam the school has been using for years			1
' that 's how they get their money , ' he told @entity22			0
' to me , they make the @entity51 look bad			0
' @entity69 , the director of development at @entity70 , admitted the school 's marketing campaign ' pushed the edge '			0
' the name ' @entity37 ' is fictitious , but unfortunately , his story is not , ' @entity69 said			0
' ( the letter ) is a true story of the very real and challenging situations that far too many children face not only in the @entity81 community , but in families found in every sphere of society			0
' ' poverty porn ' : @entity46 , president of the @entity47 , said the school is operating a scam offended : @entity58 , vice chairman of the nearby @entity60 reservation in central @entity1 , said the school is giving @entity51 a bad name good services : the school is said to be putting the donated money to good use students : the boarding school in @entity1 is home to 200 students he said it was n't the ' intention to disparage in any way the @entity103 '			1
a @entity105 appeal was sent around in november			0
@entity106 were a calendar , notepads , stickers and a dreamcatcher			0
there was a letter from a girl , @entity113 , who apparently arrived at @entity7 's one year ago			1
' you could see the hopelessness she felt in her dark brown eyes , ' the letter said			0
' ( now ) her big bright smile reveals how her life has changed			0
' financial records show @entity7 's collected $ 51 million in donations last year			1
the school 's 2013 finanical statement listed its cash on hand at $ 122 million			1
that is an increase of $ 18.5 million on the previous year			2
however @entity22 noted that it appeared the school was putting the donations to good use , with decent facilities and happy students .			2

@entity7 in @entity8 , @entity1 , is a private boarding school with 200 students
each year they send out 30 million mail packets appealing for donations
the stories of disadvantaged children that appear in the mailings are fabricated
last year the school collected $ 51 million in donations
@entity7 said that although the children are not real ' their stories are '
scheme has been *slammed* as ' poverty porn '
