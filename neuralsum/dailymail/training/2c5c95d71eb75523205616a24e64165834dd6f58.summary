by @entity0 she sobbed her way through all 11 weeks of @entity3 off , only to fall at the final hurdle			0
so when @entity6 ’s ordeal was over at last , she certainly had plenty of sorrows to drown			1
the disappointed contestant headed straight to her local pub to get ‘ absolutely trolleyed ’ – and kept her @entity12 followers updated every step of the way			0
miss @entity6 made the final three of the @entity17 competition , but was eliminated when her ‘ showstopper ’ wedding cake failed to impress judges @entity20 and @entity22			1
on the tiles : @entity6 meets up with a female friend she was soon spotted the bar of at her local pub in @entity38 , @entity39 , where she had what she described as ‘ the most desperately needed / deserved / overdue pint of my life			1

asked how her hangover was , she wrote : ‘ feeling a more than a little queasy ... ’ miss @entity6 has made no secret of the fact she found her progress through the different stages of @entity93 off more difficult than most			2
joy ... and more usually pain : @entity6 holds one of her delicious creations , and the tears flow after criticism from the judges in the final not such a showstopper : @entity6 deliberately avoided decorative baking in case she was dismissed as ' silly ' , as evidenced by her lacklustre wedding cake writing an article for @entity106 yesterday , she complained at the ‘ nastiness ’ of some fans			1
viewers had persistently complained her self - effacing manner was false modesty , and accused her of flirting with mr @entity20 to stay in the show			0
she said : ‘ i ’d rather eat my own foot than attempt to seduce my way to victory , and even if i had any intention of playing that card , it ’s insulting to both the judges to suggest that they ’d ever let their professional integrity be undermined in that way			0
