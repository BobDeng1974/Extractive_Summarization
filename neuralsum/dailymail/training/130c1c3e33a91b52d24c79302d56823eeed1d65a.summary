ms @entity20 , from @entity31 , said : ' they 're just like big dogs really			1
they have stables and paddocks outside , but they just prefer to be inside with us , and it 's nice to have them around the house			2

' i had made a sausage sandwich , and left it on the side , and when i came back , it had vanished , and there were hoof prints leading back out of the door			0
' our neighbours have horses too , so they understand , although i do n't think they 'd ever let their own horses inside			0
' they are very house trained and do n't cause a mess so my house is still clean			1
