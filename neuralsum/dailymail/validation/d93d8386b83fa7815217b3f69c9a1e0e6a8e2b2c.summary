the @entity0 have gained their most substantial poll lead since 2010 in the wake of the @entity3 , according to one poll			1
the latest @entity8 survey for the @entity9 put the @entity10 up three points to 36 per cent , with @entity12 down two to 33 , @entity13 on 14 , the @entity6 on 7 and the @entity5 on 6			1
@entity14 and @entity15 have a considerable lead on handling the economy , preferred by 42 per cent of voters , compared with the 21 per cent who back @entity20 and @entity19			2
' more impressively – for a man who was memorably booed at the @entity30 – @entity15 appears to have achieved a remarkable turnaround in public opinion			0
' this is no doubt helped by the fact that more voters think the economy is doing well than at any point in our tracking for this parliament			0
' mr @entity26 added : ' along with @entity14 's strong approval ratings the economy , and by extension @entity15 's handling of it , is overwhelmingly the @entity10 ' strongest asset going into the election			1
' however , a @entity49 poll carried out for @entity50 found no evidence of a ' @entity52 ' , and showed @entity12 ahead on 34 points , the @entity10 on 30 , @entity13 on 17 and the @entity6 on 10 per cent			2
according to the @entity55 poll , the @entity10 are on course to achieve 32 per cent of the vote , one point ahead of @entity12 's 31 per cent			0
the poll , which asks participants to predict the outcome of the election rather than how they intend to vote , confirmed that @entity13 is losing ground and is forecast to receive 13 per cent of the vote .			0

the @entity0 have gained their most substantial lead since 2010
latest @entity8 survey has put the @entity10 up three points to 36 per cent
@entity15 's budget is believed to be *responsible* for the boost
@entity74 must choose between a *£* *56billion* ***-*** a ***-*** year hit or *continuing* to offer open *borders* to @entity77 *migrants* if it chooses to leave the @entity79 , a think ***-*** tank has *warned* . @entity81 said an exit would lead to a dent in *national* income of 2.23 per cent by 2030 , with *export* *tariffs* of up to 10 per cent . the only way to avoid this would be a free trade deal , *allowing* free *movement* of *workers* .
