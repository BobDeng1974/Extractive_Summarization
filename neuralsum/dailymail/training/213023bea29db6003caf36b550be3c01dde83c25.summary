in the week since @entity3 dominated and dismantled @entity4 over 12 lop - sided rounds in @entity6 , the clamour for him to fight @entity2 has reached unprecedented levels			1
@entity3 stoked the flames by dutifully calling out @entity9 to anyone who would listen and his promoter @entity11 quickly followed suit , as he had done with gusto in the build up			1
the @entity15 , whose welterweight and light - middleweight titles @entity9 holds , then claimed they will do whatever they can to make the fight despite having ranked the pair as no 1 and no 2 for the last year without installing @entity3 as @entity9 's mandatory challenger			1
@entity9 has been quiet amid speculation over a fight with @entity3 @entity3 ( right ) defeated @entity4 to win the @entity26 world welterwight title on saturday night ' if @entity9 retires without defeating @entity3 , the question about being the best in the world will linger , ' said president @entity30			1
' there is no fight in this decade that has been expected for so long			0
' indeed , it is now five years since the fight first captured the imagination after @entity3 stopped @entity37 in 2009			1
@entity39 bookmakers immediately installed him as the favourite to beat @entity9			2
but rows over drug testing , purse splits and promotional disputes have almost strangled the life out of the so - called ' @entity46 '			0
@entity3 knocked @entity4 down six times during the fight in @entity6 , which he won on points on thursday , promoter @entity50 tweeted : ' i 'm prepared to put up the biggest guarantee in sports history to give the fans the fight			1
' that followed reports in the @entity58 that @entity9 would be guaranteed $ 100million with @entity3 pocketing $ 80m were they to finally touch gloves			1
but amid all the commotion , one man has remained silent ; @entity9 himself			1
in fact , when he commented on the fight last month , he rubbished comments from his dad and trainer @entity67 that the two would finally meet in the ring			0
' well my father is totally wrong ... the best thing for @entity3 to do is be quiet before he really gets exposed , ' he said			0
@entity9 ( right ) beat @entity73 in his last fight to take his record to 47 - 0 ' they 're bringing up my name to sell tickets			1
all you 've got to do is look at his [ pay - per - view ] numbers that he did on his last couple of fights and look at my numbers			0
' and his numbers are certainly impressive			0
while @entity3 managed around 750,000 pay - per - view buys for his rematch with @entity88 , @entity9 regularly hits the million mark			2
he was also named the richest sportsman in the world in 2013 by @entity92 having earned $ 105million for just two fights , against @entity94 and @entity73			0
reports in the @entity58 stated that @entity3 would pocket $ 80m if the pair were to finally touch gloves he could replicate that over the next 12 months from his final two fights on his @entity101 television contract , expected to take place in may and september next year			0
another two victories would take ' money ' to 49 - 0 , an identical record to legendary heavyweight @entity106			0
is he willing to risk that against @entity3 ? even if he is , @entity9 's relationship with key promoters remains a barrier			2
@entity9 , according to the reports , would earn $ 100 million if he were to fight @entity3 his bi-annual fights are broadcast on @entity101 in the @entity113 while @entity3 's are broadcast on @entity114			1
both networks are believed to be ready to show the fight simultaneously , as they did with @entity117 against @entity118 in 2002			0
but @entity114 have a deal with @entity50 's @entity120 and he hopes to schedule @entity94 's prospective fight with @entity37 on the may date normally reserved for @entity9			2
and in the same @entity123 interview , @entity9 said : ' @entity50 has always been disloyal ; very disloyal ... @entity50 is a piece of s * * *			0
@entity126 is a snake ! ' the @entity58 fighter was given a hero 's welcome on his return to his home country this week but that hurdle pales into insignificance when compared to @entity9 's feud with @entity11			0
having signed him to his @entity137 company after the @entity138 , @entity11 promoted @entity9 for the best part of a decade until he struck out on his own following a disagreement over how he was being marketed			0
and a year ago , @entity9 said the @entity3 fight will never happen ' because i will never do business with @entity11 again			1
' @entity9 ( left ) eyes up @entity145 during his title fight in @entity39 in september , 2014 he also told @entity3 to leave @entity137 if he wants the fight to take place but the @entity58 recently signed a new deal to take him through to 2016 and likely his retirement to the @entity151 in his homeland			1
that leaves public pressure and the hope that @entity9 's ego relents for long enough for him to agree to what would be the richest fight in history			2
for as straightforward as his victory over @entity94 was last year , few disagreed that it was a good test even if it came slightly too early for the young @entity162			0
an aerial view of the ring shows @entity4 knocked to the floor during a bout with @entity3 last weekend @entity73 then surprised many with his performance but there was little doubt about the result at the final bell			2
the rematch served only to allow @entity9 to notch another fight on his @entity101 bedpost			2
and as the world waits for the next lucky winner of the ' @entity9 lottery ' , there is a diminishing list of names who would provide credible opposition			0
@entity185 's @entity184 , who 12 months ago was so sure he would face @entity186 that he scrapped a fight with then world champion @entity188 , remains on the shortlist			1
@entity184 ( left ) is still on the shortlist to face @entity9 , but he must beat @entity188 in december but first , ironically , he must beat @entity188 in @entity39 on december 13			1
@entity184 aside , only @entity191 , currently operating at light - welterweight , stands out but he would not bring the razzmatazz that both @entity184 and @entity3 guarantee			2
whether @entity9 cares remains to be seen			0
december 5 , 2009 : @entity196 report @entity3 has signed a contract to fight @entity9 which the @entity58 later denies			1
december 11 : @entity199 report an eight - page contract was sent to @entity3 with a proposed date of march 13 , 2010			0
december 22 : @entity120 claim @entity3 is unwilling to agree to @entity203 - style drug testing			0
december 30 : @entity3 sues @entity9 , alleging him of making defamatory statements regarding performance - enhancing drugs			1
july 13 , 2010 : @entity11 gives @entity9 a week to sign the contract for the fight			0
july 19 : @entity9 's adviser @entity208 denies negotiations have ever taken place			0
january 20 , 2012 : @entity211 reports that @entity9 spoke to @entity3 on the phone and offered him $ 40m but @entity3 demanded a 55/45 split in @entity9 's favour			2
september 25 : @entity9 and @entity3 reach a settlement in their defamation case			2
december 20 , 2013 : @entity9 says the fight will never happen while @entity3 is promoted by @entity11			1
january , 2014 : @entity3 challenges @entity9 to fight him but to donate all proceeds to charity			1
november 22 : @entity3 beats @entity4 and tells @entity9 : ' the fans deserve the fight , i think it 's time to make it happen ' .			1
