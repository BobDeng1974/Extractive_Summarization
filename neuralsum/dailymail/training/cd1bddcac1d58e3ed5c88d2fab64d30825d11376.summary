prevention : the @entity4 is ' pulling out all the stops ' to deal with impact of bad weather , flu and the winter vomiting bug , leaders have confirmed			0
in a desperate attempt to avoid the chaos of last winter , more staff are being hired and several thousand more beds have been created there are fears that the health service may fail to cope with the fallout from winter weather – and some trusts , determined to avoid a crisis , have been running their winter strategies for the past two months , the @entity29 reported			1
while @entity40 departments see fewer patients in the winter , research shows they are more likely to be admitted			1
and as admissions soar , beds become full , operations are cancelled and staff struggle to move people on from @entity40			2
in a bid to deal with the predicted influx of patients as best as possible , trusts are recruiting nurses from abroad to tackle staff shortages so they can cope with the expected impact of @entity55 ( the winter vomiting bug ) , flu and the fall - out of the bad weather @entity61 deputy chief executive dame @entity60 said that despite hospitals already being busy – some have been running their winter strategy since september – she was ‘ not complacent			1
success : @entity61 deputy chief executive dame @entity60 said that @entity40 staff have been seeing and treating patients who were n't admitted ' in under two hours ' she added that @entity40 staff have been seeing and treating patients who were n’t admitted ‘ in under two hours ’			1
according to @entity29 , in @entity70 , @entity72 's hospital and @entity73 will get another 65 beds , with 14 more on standby			0
there had also been plans for even more expansion – but this was hampered as not enough nurses could be recruited			0
instead , doctors will work longer hours			0
other trusts are turning to nursing homes to plug the supply gap			2
@entity85 and @entity4 foundation trust has arranged for 10 patients who need rehabilitation rather than treatment to be cared for in a home , to free up hospital beds			1
in the @entity93 and @entity94 area , hospitals have recruited 35 @entity96 nurses and opened two more wards at the trust that runs @entity99			0
‘ in the middle of winter we can see an extra ward of patients coming in on any day , ' its chief executive , @entity100 , told the newspaper			2
he admitted he wants to avoid a re-run of last year 's ‘ difficult ’ winter			1
and at the @entity109 , extra ‘ temporary ’ beds created last winter have remained in existence ever since due to ‘ all - year - round pressures ’ , bosses said			1
last week @entity61 confirmed that £ 150m will be taken from its expected surplus to ease winter pressures on @entity40 departments this year			2
this is on top of an additional £ 250m given earlier in the year			0
dame @entity60 told the @entity116 : ‘ last winter was a tough one for the @entity4 so this year we started preparing earlier than ever before , with an extra £ 250m given to those local systems in greatest need to support them over winter			1
‘ to support those systems not deemed most at risk , @entity61 will be distributing a further £ 150m to help them maintain services and reduce the pressure on @entity127 caused by cold weather			2
' overwhelmed : hospitals are expecting an influx of patients suffering from @entity55 ( the winter vomiting bug ) , flu and the fall - out of the bad weather but experts warn that even this wo n’t be enough to stop a crisis			2
the medical director of one trust told the magazine recently that despite the extra £ 400m : ‘ it 's all going to go completely pear - shaped and they know it			0
’ @entity144 , chief executive of the @entity145 , which represents almost all @entity61 's acute hospitals , said : ‘ everything that can be done for this winter is being attempted on the frontline			1
' trusts have been putting more money into meeting this demand by recruiting more staff , buying extra equipment , building and extending wards and emergency units and improving links and working arrangements between community , mental health , ambulance and hospital teams			0
’ every trust is expected to vaccinate at least 75 per cent of their staff against the flu this year .			0

to try and avoid the chaos of last winter , more staff are being hired and several thousand more beds and gp appointments have been created
wards are being re-opened , built and some patients will be *relocated* to nursing homes to rehabilitate - and free up *valuable* hospital beds
@entity61 deputy chief exec dame @entity60 said @entity40 staff have been seeing and treating patients who were n’t admitted ‘ in under two hours ’
