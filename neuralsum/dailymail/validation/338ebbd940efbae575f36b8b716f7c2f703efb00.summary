the woes have increased for @entity1 , with the club fearing they will lose star striker @entity3 in the summer and their accounts showing they could still face a @entity5 fine of nearly £ 58million			1
the club are in deep relegation trouble , three points adrift of safety , and have a crucial match away to @entity10 at lunchtime on saturday			0
they have not won in their previous 11 matches against @entity14 clubs and the game will be played against a backdrop of an uncertain future			2
manager @entity18 insists that @entity3 will not be allowed to leave @entity1 for a paltry fee manager @entity18 admitted that @entity20 , whose contract runs out at the end of next season , could leave in the summer , but is adamant they will not let him go for a paltry fee			1
@entity3 has been in red - hot form in his debut season in the @entity28 with 15 goals — just behind @entity30 on 16 and top scorers @entity32 and @entity33 on 17			0
the 25 - year - old has played his way into contention when @entity37 announces his @entity39 squad next week to play in the @entity41 qualifier against @entity42 and friendly versus @entity43 later this month			0
@entity37 was at @entity44 to see @entity3 score a fine strike against @entity46 10 days ago , despite @entity1 losing			1
@entity3 has been in red - hot form in his debut season in the @entity28 with 15 goals @entity3 celebrates scoring his second goal during the @entity28 match against @entity51 @entity18 admitted : ‘ when somebody sparkles there ’s always people in there to poach them or to buy them and make their clubs better			2
‘ so we would be foolish not to be worried we ’re going to lose him			0
we hope we do n’t and we ’re glad he ’s performed in a way that other teams are trying to secure his services			0
‘ he ’s one of the top strikers in the country , it ’s not my decision whether he stays or goes , but any top striker always goes for top dollar			0
’ @entity1 have opened talks with @entity20 over a new , £ 60,000 - a - week deal , but he is keen to wait until the end of the season before making a decision			2
@entity3 has been offered a new deal at @entity44 but will wait until the end of the season to make a decision to make matters worse , the club ’s financial accounts for the 2013 - 14 season when they were in the @entity80 , filed at @entity82 on friday , show that their ‘ real ’ losses last season were almost £ 70m			1
the @entity86 ’s complex @entity5 rules are designed to discourage rich owners buying success and endangering the health of their clubs			2
a tariff of fines is in place for clubs that massively overspend			0
earlier this month , @entity1 announced they had made a loss of £ 9.8m but the accounts now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of owners — mainly @entity99 — wrote off £ 60m of old loans in an ‘ exceptional item ’ in the accounts			1
@entity1 owners including @entity99 wrote off £ 60million worth of old loans in the accounts effectively , @entity1 counted that write - off as extra income			1
but that money is noted in the accounts as being a ‘ related - party transaction ’ — and the @entity86 ’s own @entity5 regulations explicitly rule out related party moves of the kind @entity1 have undertaken , to prevent ‘ artificially ’ lowered losses			1
if the @entity28 decide @entity1 ’s ‘ real ’ losses are £ 69.8m , the @entity5 fine they potentially face will be £ 57.9m			1
@entity1 declined to comment and remain in talks with the @entity86			0
whatever is decided , refusal to pay a fine could result in their expulsion to non-league football .			0

@entity1 accounts show they could still face a *big* @entity5 fine
the fine could cost the west @entity14 club a *whopping* £ 58million
they also face the *possibility* of losing star striker @entity3
@entity3 has been offered a new contract as other clubs look to take *pounce*
