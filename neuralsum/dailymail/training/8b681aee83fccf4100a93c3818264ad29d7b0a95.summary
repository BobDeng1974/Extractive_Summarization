by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 07:54 est , 24 october 2013 if you happened to have walked through @entity2 recently , you may have noticed something strange occurring to the pathways			1
in particular , a stretch between the city centre and the @entity7 seems to be shining in dark with a peculiar blue glow			2
aliens , however , have n’t landed			0
instead , scientists from @entity11 have decided to spray the pathway with something called ‘ @entity14 ’			0
the coating is applied in three layers , with a middle aggregate stage that absorbs uv energy during the day , which is then released as a blue glow when it 's dark			1
the system uses polyurethane base and a polyaspartic topcoat that seals the whole thing together			0
according to the @entity21 , the company behind the technology , it can be applied to almost any solid surface including tarmac , concrete and wood			0
a path across @entity43 in @entity2 which glows in the dark is the first of its kind in the world			1
the illumination comes from ultraviolet particles in the pavement at the @entity2 beauty spot which absorb energy during the day and release it as light overnight @entity14 reacts to varying levels of light			1
if the sky is lighter , such as on the left , it wo n’t release as much luminosity			1
at night ( right ) it glows brighter			2
' it ’s almost like it has a mind of its own , ' said @entity62 unlike those glow in the dark stars you used to stick on your walls , @entity14 reacts to varying levels of ambient light			2
‘ this product adjusts to the natural light , so if it is pitch black outside the luminous natural earth enhances , ’ said @entity62 , owner of @entity71			0
‘ if the sky is lighter , it wo n’t release as much luminosity – it adjusts accordingly , it ’s almost like it has a mind of its own			1
’ reports suggest the group could begin to use different colours in order to create a cycle lane during the night			0
while the technology is currently being trailed at @entity92 's pieces in @entity2 , the council sad they are now considering using the path elsewhere in the city			1
with some councils turning off lights at night , @entity21 claims @entity14 could be a viable , low - maintenance alternative to keep people safe in the dark			0
the @entity2 pathway measures 150 square metres and took only 30 minutes to spray the material on			2
the surface was ready for use less than four hours after the job commenced			0

*starpath* coating is being *trialled* on a road in @entity43 in @entity2
it has three layers , with the middle one absorbing *sunlight* during the day
at night it releases a glow , which changes in *intensity* as sky gets lighter
