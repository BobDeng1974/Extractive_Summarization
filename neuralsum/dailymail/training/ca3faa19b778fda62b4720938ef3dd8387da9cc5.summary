@entity0 , father to at least 26 children , poses for a photo with @entity3 in 1997 until today , she was an attractive blonde known to the world as ‘ @entity6 ’			1
the reason for the rather disparaging description ? unfortunately for her — and especially for her four children — their father is @entity0			1
the name might not be immediately familiar , so here is his brief cv			0
mr @entity0 is the 59 - year - old bus driver who was splashed across the front page ( and two inside pages ) of a red - top tabloid a few days ago under the headline : ‘ @entity20 ’			1
he was , we were informed , @entity27 ’s most ‘ prolific dad ’ , siring 26 offspring in 37 years : a brood of 13 girls and 13 boys			2
in one shameful year alone , mr @entity0 , a former trooper with the @entity28 , fathered three children by three different women — two of whom were cousins			1
he now lives in a large , semi-detached house in @entity34 , @entity35 , with his current partner ( who , at 39 , is just one year older than his first child ) and their seven children , including a nine - month - old girl			1
perhaps the only positive thing that can be said about him is that , at least , he has a job			0
even by the standards of sink estate @entity27 , the story of @entity0 is both shocking and depressing			1
not surprisingly , most of the nine women he bedded and made pregnant that we know of are too embarrassed or ashamed to be identified			1
to date , they have been referred to only as woman 1 , @entity50 and so on , to denote the order in which they met him			2
now , though , @entity54 — woman 7 — has broken her silence			1
you might have thought there were no further shocks she could reveal about mr @entity0			1
but you would be wrong			0
apart from anything else , @entity3 , 41 , an assistant manager of a clothing store , had four children by him — not two , as previously reported — which means mr @entity0 has at least 28 , not 26 progeny			1
moreover , she was just 16 when they met			1
she carried his surname for six years , but broke off contact with him in 1997			0
@entity3 has now changed her name by deed poll , and refuses to reveal what it now is			1
who can possibly blame her ? ‘ he has n’t changed one bit , which is why i have come forward , so other women know what he ’s like and do n’t go through what i did			1
he has n’t paid me a penny in child support , ’ she says			0
how different @entity3 ’s life might have been if she had n’t boarded the number 221 bus , travelling from @entity87 to @entity88 in @entity89 , in april 1990			1
@entity54 was at the wheel and noticed the pretty teenager , who was on her way home after a night out			1
‘ the next time i got on the bus , he obviously recognised me , ’ she says			2
‘ i was dressed a little more conservatively and he said , “ i prefer the way you were dressed before ” , and it went from there			0
we often had sex at the end of his route , when he ’d have a five or ten - minute window before his next journey			2
the 59 - year - old met @entity3 when she was 16 and he was 35 @entity0 , posing with three of his children by @entity3 , who he met on a bus , in 1996 remember , @entity3 was still a schoolgirl and had barely reached the age of consent			1
@entity54 , on the other hand , was old enough to be her father			1
within weeks of meeting him on the bus , @entity3 was pregnant			1
although mortified by her relationship with a much older man , her parents stood by her and she remained living at home , where @entity54 would visit her several times a week			1
it was only during her pregnancy that @entity3 began finding out about his nefarious past			1
‘ i knew he had other kids , as he had custody of his second eldest , but i did n’t know just how many he had , ’ she says			0
‘ he was just a single parent , as far as i was aware			0
by that stage , i had fallen head over heels in love with him and i did n’t want to believe everything i heard			0
i did n’t want anyone to crush my bubble			0
’ but @entity3 began to unravel more of his lies after she gave birth to her first born , a son , in 1991			1
‘ it was quite a traumatic birth and i was in quite a bad way , ’ she says			2
‘ but about six weeks after the birth , @entity0 contacted me and asked me if i could do him a massive , massive favour			1
the favour was that the woman i later discovered he was living with ( woman 6 , in fact ) had also gone into hospital to have an emergency operation			0
‘ i knew he had had a child with her before we met , but he assured me that the woman played no part in his life and that they were no longer together			2
‘ the only contact the two had was when he went to see their child , a little boy , he told me			0
@entity0 said he had work commitments and needed someone to look after the child			1
so i did , like the stupid lapdog i was			0
‘ it was only when i was at the house with the boy that i noticed there was a ‘ mother - to - be pack ’ in the kitchen , which gives expectant mums parenting information and vouchers for your baby			1
having recently given birth myself , i knew you only got these packs when you were pregnant			1
i knew the reason the other woman had gone into hospital was n’t for an “ operation ” , but that she must have gone into labour			0
‘ i thought , “ oh my @entity187 , you ’ve gone and had another child with someone else and you got me here under false pretences to look after your toddler , while the mother is in hospital having another one of your children			1
” that ’s how i found out			0
’ of course , @entity3 should have walked away there and then			1
but she would not be the first impressionable young woman — and certainly not the last — to make the mistake of giving a cheating partner another chance			0
but few could be less deserving than @entity0			1
it is claimed that @entity0 is @entity27 ’s most ‘ prolific dad ’ , siring 26 offspring in 37 years : a brood of 13 girls and 13 boys in fact , @entity3 , as we know , went on to have three more children with @entity54 , a daughter in 1992 , and two more sons , one in 1993 , and another in 1996			1
during that time , @entity54 became increasingly controlling			2
‘ he wanted to know where i was 24/7 and insisted i travel with him on the bus , ’ she says			2
‘ if i did n’t go with him , he ’d get angry			0
my kids spent half their childhoods going up and down on buses			0
he was just a control freak			0
’ @entity54 even tried to get @entity3 to be friends with his other woman ( woman 6 )			1
‘ he used to invite me round to their house , ’ she says			0
‘ the first time i met her , we went to @entity224 with all the kids as he wanted us all to be friends			2
needless to say , she was heavily pregnant again			2
‘ i was a complete idiot for going along with it			0
i can see that now			0
but , at the time , i was young and very naive			0
‘ he even used to take us on the same holidays to the same caravan park near @entity233 , in @entity35			0
he would take us at different times in the year , but we stayed in the same caravan			0
‘ he used to tell me about it and i went along with it			0
it was almost like he brainwashed me			0
’ shortly before she finished with him in 1997 , @entity3 even ended up living next to the mother of one of his other girlfriends ( woman 8 )			1
‘ one night , the woman herself knocked on my door after noticing @entity0 ’s car parked outside , ’ she says			2
‘ i was not aware they were even in a relationship			0
‘ i later found out we were pregnant at the same time [ in 1996 ]			2
i used to see her in the neighbourhood with a bump			0
i had no idea , at the time , that @entity0 was the father			2
’ there was a final twist to this story , however			0
after they split up , @entity3 received a card in the post			2
‘ @entity3 , ’ it read , ‘ @entity0 and * * * * * [ partner ] are very pleased to announce the arrival of their fifth child [ a little girl who can not be named for legal reasons ] born on the 21/6/99			1
’ by then , @entity3 was no stranger to such contemptuous behaviour			2
‘ he ’s full of compliments when you first meet him , ’ she says			0
‘ he wines and dines you , and spends money on you , all to get you to fall for him hook , line and sinker			0
‘ i think he is an absolute disgrace to the male population			0
’ but perhaps the most damning assessment of @entity0 ’s character comes from one of his own daughters , now in her 20s , who says , ‘ i ’m ashamed of the blood running through my veins and his genes will always be in the poisonous part of me			2

one of the mothers of some of @entity0 *'s* 26 children speaks out
@entity54 - who has since changed name - met him on a bus in 1990
she was just 16 and he was 35 when he seduced her and got her pregnant
he had children with other women when they were together , @entity3 claims
she says she babysat one of his children while another mother gave birth
