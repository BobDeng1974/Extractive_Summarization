subjects like hairdressing will no longer count towards a school 's league table results more than 3,000 discredited vocational courses will be downgraded because pupils are shunning tough subjects , @entity4 declared yesterday			1
schools will be barred from using ‘ dead - end ’ qualifications – including courses in ‘ personal effectiveness ’ , fish husbandry and nail technology services – to count towards their league table rankings			2
youngsters will instead be encouraged to gain at least a c in @entity18 and maths and study science and a language			2
the @entity22 warned against pandering to the view that school is ‘ like the movies or a club ’ where pupils expect to find lessons ‘ exciting ’ – and drop out if they are too difficult			1
‘ if we say that we will tolerate or accept non-attendance on the basis that school is too hard then we are condemning children to a future where , at every stage they face a challenge , we make excuses rather than encouraging them to do better , and that way lies perdition , ’ mr @entity4 told the @entity30 education select committee			1
‘ it ’s unacceptable that people are bristling at the requirement that we have children doing @entity18 , mathematics and science to an acceptable level			0
’ @entity4 said changes to education would take time but would benefit children under a gcse ‘ equivalence ’ system introduced by @entity54 , schools were allowed to count more than 3,000 vocational courses towards their league table position			1
the courses were deemed equivalent to one or more gcses and given league table points in an attempt to motivate disaffected pupils			1
one approved course was a level 2 certificate of @entity64 , which taught children how to claim the dole			0
a report commissioned by the @entity68 found that many of the qualifications were ‘ effectively dead - end ’ with no use in the job market			0
its author , professor @entity73 , of @entity75 , said schools had been entering pupils for the courses just to amass league table points			1
mr @entity4 announced yesterday that only 125 out of 3,175 vocational qualifications for 14 to 16 - year - olds meet new criteria for inclusion in league tables			1
of these only 75 will count towards the main yardstick of secondary school performance – the percentage of pupils achieving five a * to c grades including @entity18 and maths			1
and they will count as only one gcse			0
the number of courses that will matter is to be cut from 3,000 down to just 70 schools will still be able to enter pupils for the qualifications , but from 2014 they will no longer count toward their league table rankings			2
many are expected to wither on the vine			0
former education secretary @entity101 said : ‘ by all means slim them down but do not send the message that this is a wholesale trashing of what was there and that vocational education has been downgraded			0
’ * * exam boards are touting their courses as ‘ easier ’ than rivals to win business from schools , a former director general for education standards said yesterday			0
@entity115 spoke as publisher @entity116 , which owns the @entity119 board , called for a-levels and gcses to be toughened to boost public confidence			0
pupils could in future answer a common core of questions regardless of which board had set the paper , it said .			2

@entity4 warns against idea lessons should be ' exciting ' with pupils dropping out if they are difficult
