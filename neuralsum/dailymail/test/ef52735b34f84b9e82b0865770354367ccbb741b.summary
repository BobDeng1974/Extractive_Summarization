@entity0 , who is favourite to become @entity2 ’s cricket supremo , was quick to condemn the openers after @entity4 got them both out early on			1
with @entity5 out without scoring in the first over and captain @entity7 failing again @entity0 said : ‘ their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top			2
’ @entity12 was also critical of the pair , saying : ‘ opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it ’s doing a little bit			0
if you ca n’t play that , you ’re in the wrong job			0
’ @entity0 criticised the footwork and mindset of @entity2 's top order for just looking to survive @entity5 was out for a duck on his return to the test match side in @entity26 @entity7 was clean bowled by @entity27 for 11 as @entity2 struggled on the first morning former fast bowler @entity28 said : ‘ @entity2 ’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs. ’ @entity4 ’ early success after putting @entity2 into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by @entity38 , the new @entity40 chairman , who labelled the opposition ‘ mediocre ’ .			1

@entity2 's top order *collapsed* on the first morning in @entity26
@entity5 , @entity7 and @entity44 all out *cheaply*
@entity0 critical of footwork and mindset of the trio
@entity0 is favourite to take up role of @entity2 cricket *director*
