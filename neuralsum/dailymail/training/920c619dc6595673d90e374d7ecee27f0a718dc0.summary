@entity15 is one of the worst hit areas for the disease			2
@entity0 was due to present the @entity3 awards alongside @entity29 special correspondent @entity28			1

the @entity3 awards were launched to recognise journalists who take risks to report difficult stories from around the world			1
they were set up in 1995 in memory of @entity3 , a freelance cameraman who died in @entity52 while working			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity54 said : ' @entity55 is committed to ensuring that it does not reinforce any confusion over how @entity7 is spread - we understand the medical issues and at no stage did we think that there was an infection or safety risk in @entity0 presenting the awards			2
however , @entity0 and @entity1 news are running a no - touch policy which we respect , but which would have made his job as presenter impractical and , possibly , distracting for the audience			1
so after discussion with @entity1 , we thought it would be easier for @entity45 to present instead			2
' last night 's award for news went to 23 - year - old @entity75 for his reports on the conflict in the @entity78			0

@entity28 , who was due to be @entity0 's co-host has previously spoken out about the dangers of creating panic in reports of @entity7			2
in a recent interview with the @entity111 she said : ' i think the fear in @entity114 , @entity115 and everywere else is out of proportion because they will get cases of @entity7 , absolutely			0
but will it spread like it has done in @entity120 ? really unlikely			0
you need to be alert , but do you think it â€™s going to take over and kill half of @entity124 ? no. ' mr @entity0 has reported from locations across the world , including appearing here in the @entity128			0

@entity0 , chief correspondent , was due to present @entity3 awards
