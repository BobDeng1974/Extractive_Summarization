by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world , and rightly so			2
his shot - stopping prowess and supreme command of the box have made him a formidable opponent for any forward			0
but on monday night in @entity11 showed another side to his game , using his feet to great effect			0
time and again the @entity17 keeper stormed out of his area to sweep up behind a lethargic back - line which looked unable to cope with the pacy @entity20 on the break			1
in fact @entity2 made as many tackles during the game as he did saves , with @entity51 failing to really stretch the @entity17 number one inside his area until deep into extra time			1
throughout the last - 16 tie the @entity55 goalkeeper touched the ball 21 times outside his penalty area , and in the first half in particular he seemed to be playing more outside his box than inside			0
@entity62 have a history of world class sweepers , but the @entity65 winning captains @entity66 and @entity68 were both outfield players , whereas @entity2 has take on the role from between the sticks			2
diving in : @entity35 feels the full force of a @entity2 challenge as the keeper sweeps up for his defence heads up : the keeper is out again , this time to head away with @entity76 closing in for @entity51 hands on : @entity2 looked a little less comfortable with his hands , dropping one cross under pressure out again : with little pace in the @entity17 back - line @entity2 took on the role of sweeper - keeper to great effect celebration : @entity2 ensured @entity62 stayed solid at the back , and celebrated when they finally scored @entity40 @entity17 survive @entity51 scare his starting position , from right on the edge of the area , meant that he was able to stop moves before they had a chance to develop in behind his back four			1
@entity11 's high - risk strategy is similar to that employed by @entity99 goalkeeper @entity98 at @entity100 , and it paid off , as @entity62 limited @entity51 to just two shots on target during the first 90 minutes , neither of them particularly threatening			2
the @entity55 stopper also showed some playmaking abilities when he set @entity107 away with a long punt after collecting a corner			0
@entity62 eventually found a way past @entity2 's opposite number @entity111 in extra time , @entity114 duo @entity107 and @entity115 with the goals			1
@entity2 was finally beaten in the 121st minute but by then the game was safe .			0

@entity2 makes as many tackles as saves in ' sweeper - keeper ' role
@entity17 keeper helps out shaky defence with high starting position
@entity62 eventually win 2 - 1 after *extra-time* against @entity51
