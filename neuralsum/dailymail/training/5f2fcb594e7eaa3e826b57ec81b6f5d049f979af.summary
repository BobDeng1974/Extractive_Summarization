but staff sergeant @entity6 's homecoming was made all the more joyful when he saw that his wife @entity7 , who had been unhappy with her weight for years , had lost almost five stone while he was in @entity10			1
mother - of - four @entity7 , 34 , from @entity12 , had struggled with her weight ever since giving birth to the couple 's first child , and had soon ballooned to 17 stone and larger than a size 22			1
before and after : @entity7 with husband @entity6 before losing the weight , left , and with @entity6 and baby @entity19 after losing almost five stone while he was on tour in @entity10 but @entity6 's absence provided just the kick she needed to drop four dress sizes and slim down 12 stone , a size 14 , the same size she was before starting a family			1
@entity7 had been gradually piling on the pounds during her 14 year marriage - particularly after the birth of each of their four children , @entity33 , 14 , @entity34 , eight , @entity35 , five and 18 - month - old @entity19 - but when @entity6 suggested they renew their wedding vows the thought of walking down the aisle , almost ten dress sizes larger , forced @entity7 to lose weight			1
happy family ! @entity7 and @entity6 with their four children @entity33 , 14 , @entity34 , 8 , @entity35 , 5 and 18 - month - old @entity19 so when @entity6 was deployed to @entity10 , @entity7 joined @entity44 , enrolled at her local gym and went on to shed almost five stone - shrinking from 16 stone 11 to a slender 12 stone			1
and eighteen months after her first slimming class , @entity7 slipped into a size 14 dress - the same size as her original wedding dress - and walked down the aisle to renew her wedding vows			2
she said : ' we 'd planned to renew our vows for our 10th wedding anniversary but i just did n't feel confident and knew the photographs would be horrible as i was so much bigger than when we first got married			0
' i 'd slowly put on weight having children and when @entity6 went to @entity10 i knew it was a good time to do something about it			2
' sweet tooth : @entity7 , pictured before her dramatic weight loss , dropped four dress sizes by swapping cake and takeaway for fruit and vegetables @entity7 continued : ' he was away for six months and i lost a stone and a half , i felt so great i carried on			1
@entity6 was back and fourth for the next year and each time he returned i 'd lost more weight			1
' he was very shocked when he first saw me and could n't believe how much my shape had changed , but he 's proud of what i 've achieved			0
' to lose the pounds , @entity7 swapped takeaways and chocolate for fruit and vegetables			0
she also started working out at the gym twice a week and took up @entity82 dance classes			0
@entity7 , pictured left before losing the weight , and right having lost almost five stone , said : ' when you 've lost weight people look at you because you look nice , not because you 're overweight ' proud husband : when @entity6 returned from @entity10 , his wife @entity7 had lost nearly five stone to surprise him she said : ' it took a lot of hard work but it was worth it , especially when you see the weight start to come off			1
the real milestone for me was when i could get into clothes that i had n't been able to get into for years			0
' my lifestyle has changed so much , i feel a lot healthier now and not so out of breath			0
i finally have the confidence to go into the room and not worry that people are staring at me			0
' @entity7 and @entity6 renewed their vows at @entity108 near their home in @entity12 last month			1
and just eighteen months after struggling to fit in a size 22 , @entity7 walked up the aisle the same dress size as when the couple first married 14 years ago			1
wedding days : @entity6 and @entity7 have now renewed their marriage vows , and @entity7 was thrilled to be able to wear a dress the same size as the one she wore on her wedding day 15 years earlier she said : ' i was so happy with myself			2
when i fit in a dress the same size as the one i wore on our wedding day all those years ago i could n't quite believe it			2
' it 's a real achievement			0
i know i 've still got a little way to go but i 've had lots of support and achieved so much already , i know i can do it			0
' i would say to anyone wanting to lose weight just take that first step			2
' it will take a lot of hard work but it 's worth it in the end when you can fit into clothes you 've only ever dreamed of			0
' when you 've lost weight people look at you because you look nice , not because you 're overweight			1
