rating : ' sorry , i ’m just leaning across you momentarily , ' a well - spoken young man says to my wife as he stretches to collect her side plate			2
we are taken by his turn of phrase and bedside manner			2
come to think of it , the girl who showed us to our room had the same sort of polite confidence and plummy inflection			2
then there are the paintings of hunting scenes , the tartan carpeting up the stairs and on the landings , the framed hand - written letters			2
it makes us think that this can only be a toff enterprise staffed by the proprietor ’s godchildren and their gap - year friends			2
a slice of @entity29 tradition : @entity30 is a classic country pub in a pretty @entity33 pub to further our inquiries , we ask the leaning - across - you - momentarily waiter for some background			1
he explains that the @entity38 in @entity33 , about six miles from @entity39 , is owned by @entity40 , who lives in the manor house			1
he bought the @entity43 - listed pub first , and then the building next door , and has turned it into an exemplary restaurant and bar with 12 rooms upstairs			1
it is a higgledy - piggledy building that stoops precariously over the pavement , with a courtyard at the back , where a few tables are laid for dinner			1
our room has plenty of exposed beams , a pretty @entity59 boudoir bed , a spacious bathroom			2
there is a note saying that tea or coffee is available 24 hours a day at no extra cost			0
just press zero on the telephone			0
there is a formal restaurant called @entity69 , but because of a recent change of chef , it is not in operation			1
instead , we eat in the brasserie , where we are given three tiny freshly - baked rolls and a tub of unsalted butter			1
the menu offers gastropub staples : chicken caesar , posh fish and chips , @entity86 rib eye , @entity81			0
i ’m torn between the @entity88 and @entity30 burger , eventually opting for the former , but it ’s the burger that turns up			0
warm welcome : the pub offers a red - brick interior with exposed beams and leather chairs the waitress is mortified , but i ’m quietly pleased she ’s made a mistake - and would have been even more so if the burger had n’t been quite so rubbery			1
towards the end of dinner , we establish that our erudite waiter is only 18			1
he seems like a proper grown - up to me - but then , this is a grown - up sort of operation			0
he is not around at breakfast in the morning			0
in fact , it ’s all very quiet , except for some dreadful and entirely unnecessary muzak			0
the low - ceiling dining room does not feel as inviting as it did the night before , so we ask if the doors to the courtyard can be opened to let in some fresh air			0
before leaving , we wander up the high street			0
@entity38 is a proper working village , with a couple of shops and a post office			1
@entity30 used to be the place where farm labourers and domestic servants were hired			0
today , it ’s back in business offering sure - footed service with the help of some friendly , articulate staff who can be forgiven for some lapses in concentration			1
the @entity130 , @entity131 01449 740510 @entity132 double rooms from £ 100 , including breakfast rating :			0

the @entity38 is a classic country pub in the @entity33 *countryside*
it has been converted into a foodie *hotspot* with restaurant and brasserie
the @entity145 *'s* @entity144 *enjoyed* dinner , despite minor service errors
