there has been a lot of woeful decisions in the @entity3 in recent weeks			0
but the decision to rule out @entity6 ’s second goal at @entity7 surely tops the lot when it comes to embarrassing the art of officiating			0
the @entity12 thought he had grabbed a brace when he reeled away in celebration at @entity7 to add sparkle to @entity17 ’s win against @entity18			1
@entity18 were on the attack with goalkeeper @entity42 nowhere to be seen when the ball broke to the defender who galloped clear from his own half before coolly slotting home			0
the linesman tells referee @entity45 that @entity21 's goal should be ruled out for offside @entity21 's celebrations are short lived as officials rule out the @entity12 defenders second goal video highlights later showed the linesman telling the referee in his ear piece that there was only one player covering , therefore the player was offside			2
but that ruling would only come into play if the defender was in the oppositions half when he was played the ball , with replays showing he was five - yards or so in his own half			0
it was clearly one of the worst decisions ever seen in the @entity3 , but luckily for the officials @entity17 still secured all three points with a 2 - 1 win to keep their top four dreams alive			1
match winner @entity68 has an effort blocked by @entity18 defender @entity70 former @entity17 striker @entity71 did not have an enjoyable return to @entity7 with @entity73 @entity74 ( left ) and @entity21 celebrate during @entity17 's 2 - 1 @entity3 win against @entity18			1

@entity6 thought he had grabbed his second goal of the game
but the officials *mistakenly* disallowed the @entity12 's effort for offside
@entity17 still went on to beat @entity18 2 - 1
@entity19 's side are now just three points off @entity86
