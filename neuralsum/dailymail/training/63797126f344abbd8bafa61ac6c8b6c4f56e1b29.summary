@entity0 have been forced to put one of their jetlagged late arrivals on standby for saturday ’s first test against the @entity4 amid fears that @entity6 may become the latest key man to be ruled out			1
the @entity9 scrum - half suffered a shoulder injury in training and if he fails a fitness test at @entity14 , @entity15 will be promoted to wear the no 9 shirt , with @entity17 — who arrived in @entity18 on wednesday — on the bench			1
as he announced a weakened line - up with a total of just 299 caps in the starting xv , head coach @entity20 said : ‘ @entity6 is a concern			1
he fell awkwardly in training on monday , jarring his shoulder , and i ’m giving him until the captain ’s run on friday			1
' at the moment we ’re hoping he ’ll be fine but it ’s meant i ’ve had to put @entity17 on standby and @entity15 would start if @entity6 is out			1
it ’s not ideal , but needs must			2
’ plane crazy : @entity0 , pictured training at the @entity38 in @entity39 on thursday , forced to call on jetlagged @entity17 as fears grow for @entity6 ahead of first test against @entity4 concerns : @entity6 ( left ) suffered a shoulder injury during training with @entity17 only arriving in @entity4 on wednesday after lifting the @entity45 at @entity46 @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , may , @entity51 , @entity6 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 it certainly is n’t ideal			1
@entity0 will be desperate to avoid losing @entity6 , a stand - out figure during their @entity63 campaign , while @entity15 has endured a season of fluctuating form and @entity66 ’s @entity17 may have to play seven days after appearing in his club ’s @entity45 final win			1
@entity0 go into the encounter with the world champions with an exciting but potentially vulnerable 10 - 12 combination			0
@entity51 will be preferred to @entity72 at fly - half and his inside centre sidekick is @entity75 — who was out of favour at @entity77 during the last month of the season			2
while @entity49 will provide significant ballast at outside centre , the @entity4 will no doubt target his midfield team - mates by deploying the rampaging @entity83 to test their defensive resolve			1
@entity20 is adamant that his rookies can withstand the onslaught , saying : ‘ they ’ll be ready because it ’s going to come their way			1
they ’re going to be tested			0
in our system , @entity51 has been good ( defensively )			0
we ’ve had various back - line combinations in the past and we ’ve always been solid			0
credit goes to @entity96 ( @entity97 ) for that			0
there ’s nothing i ’ve seen in training that has me lying awake worrying about it			1
’ @entity75 played both @entity103 against @entity104 last june and impressed the management with his free - spirit exploits			0
the former @entity108 rugby league player has not been selected since but @entity20 said : ‘ having worked with him in @entity104 , where he got his first caps , he was exceptional on that tour and every time he ’s trained with us we ’ve seen huge potential in him			1
the partnership of him and @entity49 has been looking promising in training			2
plunged into action : @entity15 could play at scrum half if @entity6 fails to make the cut ‘ as a midfield partnership it ’s nicely balanced			1
it ’s still got that ball - playing 12 that i prefer to have , someone to distribute and make good decisions and it ’s got the power runners as well			0
we need to give @entity75 the licence to do what he does best — that ’s put people through holes — but also encourage him to take on players himself as he ’s a genuine running and passing threat			0
’ @entity51 is another creative force when he is on his game , which was not often last season as the saga of his move from @entity140 to @entity141 left his confidence in tatters			0
@entity0 need him to regain his strut quickly and @entity20 insisted he has done so , having been told that the absence of @entity146 left him on track to start the first test			2
‘ that started back in @entity0 , ’ said the head coach			2
‘ as soon as the @entity146 scenario unfolded the message to @entity51 was “ i know you ’ve been disappointed with your own form but you need to understand that there ’s a very good chance you ’ll be starting this first test			2
you need to get your head round it and make sure you ’re going to be on the money if it comes ”			0
the acid test : @entity20 ( left ) takes @entity0 to @entity4 to face the might of the @entity4 ‘ if he trained well and put his best foot forward [ i told him ] he would be starting			1
he ’s taken it with both hands			0
by giving him the notice early it ’s allowed him to mentally prepare and as a consequence he has led the team well			2
’ the coaches have been paying particular attention to enhancing confidence to compensate for the personnel problems			0
@entity0 have able deputies but some are alarmingly short of recent game - time , such as @entity53			0
@entity176 is preferred to @entity177 as the lock in charge of the lineout operation , while @entity57 ’s superb form for @entity182 forced him ahead of @entity183 to start at blindside @entity184 back , @entity48 is recalled on the right wing			0
‘ i think it ’s a strong side , ’ said @entity20 but he will relish naming a far stronger one next week .			1

@entity17 is on standby for saturday *'s* @entity148 despite only arriving in @entity4 on wednesday
scrum half @entity6 suffered a shoulder injury in training
@entity15 will wear no 9 if @entity6 is ruled out
coach @entity20 said : ‘ @entity6 is a concern . he fell awkwardly in training on monday , jarring his shoulder , and i ’m giving him until the captain ’s run on friday . '
