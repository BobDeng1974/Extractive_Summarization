by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 17:46 est , 24 april 2013 to the deafening sound of @entity2 , mothers and their pubescent daughters roam the giant basement toting enormous shopping baskets filled to the brim			2
but the baskets do not contain capri pants , sundresses or other summer fashion staples , but thongs , push - up bras and skimpy knickers in neon shades , lace and leopard prints			1
welcome to @entity18 , the teenage fashion department of @entity20 lingerie giant @entity19 on @entity22 ’s @entity21			1
@entity23 : @entity0 and @entity24 , 13 , with the racy underwear on sale at @entity18 the brand , which is known for its risqué advertising campaigns and multi-million pound fashion shows featuring supermodels dubbed @entity31 , opened its doors in @entity33 last summer , bringing its signature brand of overtly sexy underwear to a nation reared on @entity38 smalls			1
i turn around , keen to ask my 13 - year - old daughter @entity24 what she thinks of the store			2
but she is long gone — rifling through the rows of candy - coloured padded ‘ plunge ’ bras			1
a woman in front of me is combing through piles of bottom - revealing ‘ mini cheeksters ’ and eye - wateringly skimpy ‘ v - strings ’ , until she emerges , triumphant , with a pair of extremely brief , lace - trimmed purple knickers			2
i assume she is buying them for herself , until she hands them to the 12 - year - old schoolgirl by her side			2
the store seems to be heaving , but just last month the brand found itself mired in controversy with the launch of ‘ @entity62 ’ , part of their @entity18 lingerie range aimed at teenagers featuring slogans such as ‘ call me ’ and ‘ feeling lucky ’			1
parents were outraged , accusing the company of seeking to ‘ sexualise ’ very young girls			1
an online petition started by a mother to protest against the range has collected almost 19,000 signatures			2
after the outcry , some items were removed from the website and the company released a statement describing @entity18 as ‘ a line for college - age women ’			1
capturing a younger market : @entity19 said their @entity18 range is intended for ' college - age ' girls speaking at a conference to publicise the new collection , @entity89 , the company ’s chief financial officer , reportedly said : ‘ when somebody ’s 15 or 16 years old , what do they want to be ? ' they want to be older and they want to be cool like the girl in college and that ’s part of the magic of what we do at @entity18			1
’ the strategy is working			0
by 2010 , six years after its launch in the @entity20 , @entity18 had recorded £ 650million in sales and had become so popular that stand alone stores had been launched in @entity108			1
but , as any mother knows , if something ’s targeted at 16 - year - olds , it ’ll be 12 and 13 - year - olds who covet it most			0
in fact , when the @entity22 store opened last year , my daughter and her friends went wild with excitement			0
they knew all about @entity18 from its glamorous advertising in fashion magazines and could n’t wait to buy in to the brand			1
one of @entity24 ’s friends even attended the shop opening			0
yet step inside @entity22 ’s @entity19 , and it ’s clear that @entity18 could n’t be more dissimilar to @entity129 , @entity130 or any other mainstream teen brand			2
in order to reach @entity18 , youngsters have to walk through the main store , which is kitted out like a bordello			2
the walls and floor are covered with gleaming black lacquer , mannequins display risqué underwear and numerous @entity142 mirrors reflect sheer lace babydoll nighties , corsets , thongs and suspenders			0
concerns : @entity24 thought the store was like a ' girls ' dream world ' but her mother worries it 's too raunchy once downstairs , many of the items in the @entity18 collection are far from suitable for girls of that age			1
lingerie ranges have names like ‘ the @entity18 flirt collection ’ and bras are categorised as ‘ the heartbreaker plunge , ’ ‘ date bras ’ and ‘ campus push - ups ’ , and are typically padded , under - wired or trimmed with lace			1
many of the knickers are blatantly provocative : there are piles of lacy thongs and bright pink knickers which invite you to , ‘ enjoy the view ’			1
looking through one of the many displays of knickers are 14 - year - old @entity177 , 12 - year - old @entity178 , her 11 - year - old sister @entity177 and their mum @entity179 , here from @entity181 for a day ’s shopping			0
‘ i am happy to be here with my mum , ’ says @entity177 quietly			0
‘ i think if i came with people my own age , i would feel under pressure to buy some of the more sexy items to show off			0
’ @entity18 was conceived as a transition range , to introduce teenage girls to the @entity192 ’s secret brand before moving to the more adult lines — like a @entity195 ’s @entity194 , but for lingerie			1
but not all the teens shopping in the store are plumping for modest , age - appropriate choices			0
@entity200 from @entity201 is shopping with her daughter @entity202 , aged 12			0
‘ most of the bras are underwired and when we first came last year , @entity202 wanted desperately to have one			0
but i felt uncomfortable about my young daughter wearing something which would give her “ cleavage ”			2
as for the main @entity192 ’s @entity210 shop upstairs , it is totally off limits			0
’ last month i wrote in @entity213 about the huge pressures which i , as a mother , feel that young teenagers are under to grow up too soon			0
looking around @entity18 , which is positively humming with middle - class mothers and daughters , i feel depressingly vindicated			1
of course , the fear for parents like me is that , in buying sexy underwear , our daughters will send out the message that they are ready to have sex long before this is the case			1
provocative : @entity0 fears the @entity18 range is encouraging young girls to grow up too fast dr @entity229 , a psychologist specialising in child health education , explains that this is not unfounded			1
‘ through a label like @entity18 , @entity19 is clearly playing to the aspirational tendencies of the young			1
there is a clear line which can be drawn between exposing children to premature sexual cues and increased underage sexual behaviour			0
’ i spot @entity24 again , bursting with excitement and keen to show me the contents of her basket which includes several underwired bras as well as t - shirts and a sweatshirt			2
fortunately , she has avoided the more provocative knickers and looks disparagingly at those emblazoned with slogans			0
as we approach the changing rooms — – styled as gold and white mini-boudoirs — i am struggling to understand the appeal of @entity18			2
@entity24 explains : ‘ teenagers want to buy underwear because it ’s something that ten - year - olds ca n’t do			0
‘ we are more image conscious than you were at my age and that means getting the whole look , not just clothes but hair , make - up and underwear too			0
’ but if raunchy underwear is part of that look , does n’t she feel that there is a danger of giving out the wrong signals ? emulating the @entity31 : but by wearing sexy underwear , young girls are sending out the message they are ready for sex before they actually are ‘ well obviously by 13 , you are starting to think about being more attractive to boys , but my friends and i like it more because it ’s fashionable and gives us a confidence boost			1
’ we end up buying t - shirt and a pastel - coloured bra which are both definitely at the acceptable end of the spectrum			0
as i hand over my credit card , i am conscious of the vast video wall at the top of the stairs which is playing footage of the @entity19 runway shows — a clear reminder of the very adult world just steps away — and suppress an involuntary shudder			0
i ask @entity24 what she thinks of the store			0
‘ it ’s like a girls ’ dream world , ’ she replies without hesitation			0
‘ raunch culture ’ or ‘ dream world ? ’ as a parent , i know what i think , but as we leave behind queues of young girls waiting to pay at the tills , i am left with the distinct impression that in this debate , there is only one winner and her name is @entity192 .			1

lingerie giant 's @entity18 range appeals to young girls
under - wired bras and lacy thongs are blatantly provocative
concern girls wearing lingerie will send message they *'re* ready for sex
