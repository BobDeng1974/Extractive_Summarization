' ' growing up , i made a few myself , ' he said			2
' and i have to confess , sometimes i wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down			1
but one of the things you 've learned over the last four years is that there 's no longer any room for excuses			0
' ' nobody cares how tough your upbringing was			0
nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination , ' he added			1
the president also spoke about the importance of family and what it was like growing up with an absent father			1
he challenged graduates to ' transform the way we think about manhood			1
' ' my whole life , i ’ve tried to be for @entity57 and my girls what my father was n’t for my mother and me , ' he said			0
' i want to break that cycle - where a father ’s not at home , where a father ’s not helping to raise that son and daughter			1
i want to be a better father , a better husband , a better man			1
' @entity0 's father , @entity69 , was a @entity70 governmental economist who divorced the younger @entity0 's mother within three years of marrying her			0

' i might have been in prison			0
i might have been unemployed			0

' that ’s an experience that so many other @entity89 share			0
hispanic @entity89 know that feeling when someone asks where they come from or tells them to go back			0
' @entity122 feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love they share			0

he said : ' for black men in the forties and fifties , the threat of violence , the constant humiliations , large and small , the gnawing doubts born of a @entity148 culture that told you every day you were somehow inferior , the temptation to shrink from the world , to accept your place , to avoid risks , to be afraid , was necessarily strong			1
' and yet , here , under the tutelage of men like dr. @entity175 , young @entity138 learned to be unafraid			1
he , in turn , taught others to be unafraid			0
