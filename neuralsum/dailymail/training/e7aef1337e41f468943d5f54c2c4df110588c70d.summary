motorists were spared fuel price rises as the chancellor confirmed a freeze on petrol and diesel duty would go ahead as planned from april 2015			1
@entity6 announced he was scrapping the ‘ trigger - point ’ for automatically putting up duty if oil prices drop below a set level , as they did recently			2
but yesterday ’s parallel report by the @entity12 suggested that duty rises could return in september 2015 and rise in line with inflation from 2016 to 2019			1
relief : @entity6 announced he was scrapping the ‘ trigger - point ’ for automatically putting up duty @entity20 president @entity19 welcomed the confirmed april 2015 freeze but said the @entity12 report appeared to confirm the fears of 84 per cent of @entity20 members in a recent poll who said they were concerned that motoring taxes would increase after next may ’s general election			1
mr @entity6 said he was ‘ freezing fuel duty to help hardworking people be more financially secure ’			0
he added : ‘ action on fuel duty since 2011 will save a typical motorist £ 675 by the end of 2015 - 16			1
’ however , the @entity12 report said : ‘ the next duty rate rise , planned for september 2015 , means that receipts are expected to increase by 0.3 per cent in 2015 - 16			1
sceptical : motorists fear rises in duty in the future ' from april 2016 onwards duty rate rises are assumed to be in line with @entity46 inflation , leading to receipts growth of 2.5 per cent on average between 2016 - 17 and 2019 - 20			1
’ mr @entity19 said : ‘ today ’s re-confirmation of a £ 15billion investment in @entity52 roads and the continuing fuel duty freeze puts drivers on a “ highway to hope ” after some hellish years of high fuel prices , potholed roads and only patchy investment			0
' but our members were right to be sceptical about future taxes			0
’ @entity63 director professor @entity62 said : ‘ the chancellor is pushing for more transparency in the pricing of airline tickets , so now he should also back our call for pump receipts to show how much of the price of petrol and diesel is tax			1
' currently well over 60 per cent goes to the @entity74 in the form of fuel duty and vat			0
’ @entity63 chief engineer @entity78 said : ‘ the negative impact of fuel duty on economic growth is now acknowledged by the @entity82			1
' with fuel duty already frozen until may 2015 , we had feared an early return to the fuel duty escalator system – a deeply unpopular practice which led to a series of fuel duty hikes			2
' but , for now , it appears that is not going to be the case			0
’ @entity93 , founder of the @entity94 , said the government should investigate why pump price falls are not keeping pace with plummeting oil prices : ‘ there should be 7p less showing at the pumps			2
who is holding onto this profit ? ’ motorway filling stations will soon have to post their prices in advance on roadside signs so motorists can see if there is cheaper fuel ahead			0
ministers were inspired by the system used in @entity112 where motorists can see the price of fuel at a variety of outlets on signposts ( pictured ) miles before they reach each service station			0
it is hoped the move will promote competition and lower fuel prices			0
the signs will be tested at five service stations on the @entity125 between @entity126 and @entity127 , with a view to being introduced @entity52 - wide by the end of 2015			0
the @entity63 last month found motorway service stations charge 10p more a litre of petrol than the national average .			2

tax will once again be fixed at its current level in april next year
move hailed by motorist groups *including* @entity63 , @entity20 and @entity94
but duty rises could return in september 2015 and continue to 2019
