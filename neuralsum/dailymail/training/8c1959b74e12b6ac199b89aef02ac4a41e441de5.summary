@entity0 fanatic : @entity3 sources say @entity4 should be handed over to the authorities in @entity6 this weekend the ten - year battle to deport @entity4 was finally nearing its conclusion last night			1
preparations are in hand to put the hate preacher on a plane home early on sunday			0
the farcical saga , which has enraged politicians and the public alike , has already cost £ 2million			1
although ministers insist legal hurdles remain , @entity3 sources say the @entity0 fanatic should be handed over to the authorities in @entity6 this weekend			1
the breakthrough follows yesterday ’s adoption by the @entity22 state of a treaty that will protect @entity4 ’s human rights			1

last night security minister @entity39 said : ‘ while further steps remain , our focus is on seeing @entity4 on a plane to @entity6 at the earliest opportunity			1
’ @entity45 – once dubbed @entity47 ’s right hand man in @entity48 – has repeatedly used human rights laws to thwart his removal			1
he claimed his trial for plotting a terror attack would be unfair because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture			0
shock move : earlier this year , @entity4 said he would return home voluntarily when the treaty home secretary @entity60 ( pictured ) agreed with @entity6 is fully ratified this argument , originally rejected by the @entity63 courts , was upheld by judges in @entity65			1
it forced home secretary @entity60 to seek new legal guarantees from @entity6 that @entity45 ’s rights would not be breached			1
the case then began again in the @entity63 courts and was expected to take years			0
but , in a shock move earlier this year , @entity4 said he would return home voluntarily when the treaty mrs may agreed with @entity6 is fully ratified			1

over the past eight years , @entity45 ’s lawyers have pocketed £ 864,944 in legal aid			2

the cost to taxpayers of trying to boot him out has been a further £ 938,630 in the domestic courts , and £ 130,018 at the @entity116 in @entity65			2
this gives a net total of £ 1,716 , 286			2
he has spent years in maximum security prisons , with every year inside costing taxpayers up to £ 60,000			0
' while further steps remain , our focus is on seeing @entity4 on a plane to @entity6 at the earliest opportunity ' security minister @entity39 in may a court was told that @entity4 and his family had complained that their taxpayer - funded house was too small and they did not have enough storage space			1
judges heard that his family would join him in @entity6 rather than stay behind in @entity63			2
