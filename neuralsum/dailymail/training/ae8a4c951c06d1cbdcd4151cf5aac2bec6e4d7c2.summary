it is thought that he was buried at the coastal site in @entity9 , @entity10 , and now the foundation of an ancient fortress with one - metre - wide walls has been exposed in an excavation there by the @entity15 , which dates the remains to the @entity17 period - 850 to 586 bc. it verifies the existence of life there during the time of the eighth - century prophet , who according to @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity27 scriptures , defied @entity29 and spent three nights in the belly of a fish or whale as punishment before being released			1
evidence : the remains of the fortress indicate that there was life on the @entity3 at the time he was said to have existed @entity41 , the @entity42 of the @entity15 , said : ‘ @entity43 , which rises 50 metres above sea level , is the highest hill in @entity9 , whence one can look out to sea , to @entity47 – located in the @entity49 estuary which was probably an ancient anchorage , and to @entity9			2
