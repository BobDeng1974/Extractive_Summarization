a popular @entity1 - based beauty brand is claiming to have created a one - of - a - kind lip treatment which promises to completely eradicate any signs of dryness or chapping - a common problem which plagues millions people each year as soon as the colder winter months arrive			1
but according to @entity8 , chapped lips could well be a thing of the past thanks to the brand 's newly - launched @entity11 , a $ 15 treatment kit which includes a lip exfoliating stick and an overnight mask			1
bite claims that the lip - treating duo will ' replenish and revitalize lips ' , leaving you with a ' healthy , soft and nourished ' pout after just five nights			1
having been a dedicated lover of lipstick for many years now , i 've always found it irksome that , during the coldest times of the year , i am forced to abandon my favorite bold lip colors in favor of boring balms and salves in an attempt to heal my dry , cracked , wind - battered lips			1
as a result of the recent frosty weather in @entity45 - gale - force winds and sub-zero temperatures - my lips have been worse than ever during the past few months and i was desperate for a solution			2
on paper the treatment seems incredibly well - thought out			2
bite have even ensured that all of the ingredients included in their products , which are intended to be used over night , are ' food - grade ' , meaning that they can be ingested without any fear that the user will be exposed to something dangerous or unpleasant			0
similarly , the dosage is incredibly generous ; there is more than enough product to last you through the suggested five nights of use			0
but how does the treatment fair when it is actually put to use ? day one : my lips were dry and sore , and i am unable to wear lipstick day four : after using the treatment for three nights , i braved lipstick for the first time in weeks			1
@entity74 happy to see that it applied smoothly - with just the tiniest hint of dryness detectable day six : following five nights of treatment , my lips were back to their usual , flake - free state and all my lipsticks were back in action upon first use , i was quite surprised to find that the exfoliating stage of the @entity30 treatment , which comes packaged in a fun , medicinal jar , was actually rather uncomfortable to use			1
according to the brand 's description , the @entity88 is supposed to ' gently buff away impurities ' with ' castor oil beads to help leave lips soft and supple ' and ' fruit extracts to help brighten and restore lips '			1
but despite its deliciously sweet scent - it really does smell , and taste , like cherry - flavored sugar - i found that the scrub had a bit of a bite to it and left my already - dry lips feeling red raw and quite sore			2
in all fairness , i perhaps did n't hesitate to think about was the fact that i was rubbing my lips with a stick of what is essentially a lump of sugar granules ; it might have been worth proceeding with a slightly lighter hand , at least initially			0
thankfully , the second stage of the treatment - the @entity115 - was wonderfully soothing , and really felt like it was helping to nourish my flaky , cracked lips			2
the idea is to leave the lip mask on overnight , in order to allow it to work its ' magic ' while you sleep , so , following the instructions carefully , i left the treatment on and headed to bed			1
initially , the next morning , i did n't notice a huge amount of difference - until i realized , at around lunchtime , that i had n't reached for my lip balm once since leaving the house which , given that i had taken to applying some sort of salve almost every 15 minutes , was something of a personal triumph			1
a further two nights ' worth of treatments later and the improvement was far more obvious			0
my lips were smooth , soft and practically flake - free , bar the odd stubborn crack which refused to heal straight away			0
i even dared to reach for one of my favorite lipsticks and was happy to see that it applied pretty smoothly - with just the tiniest hint of dryness detectable			0
and on day six , the cure was complete as far as i was concerned - although i still had plenty of both of the products left over			0
after five nights of use , my lips were back to their usual , flake - free state and all my lipsticks were back in action			2
plus , there is still plenty of both products left over , which means i do n't have to purchase the same kit again , should my lips run into any trouble in the future			0
all in all , i 'd consider this test a real success			0
and i 'm not the only one who thinks so ; thus far , the product has received an overwhelmingly positive response on social media , with fans of the brand taking to both @entity168 and @entity169 to heap praise on the treatment			0
' holy grail beauty item ! could n't live without it this winter ! ' one person wrote on @entity169 , while another added : ' the only thing that works [ to help chapped lips ] is the 5 night fix for lips by @ bitebeauty - i do n't wear lip balm anymore ! '			1

the $ 15 treatment consists of a lip exfoliator and an overnight lip mask
@entity8 claims the lip balm duo will ' repair and restore ' your lips no matter what state they are in
