many rejoiced yesterday as @entity1 finally announced her long - awaited campaign to be @entity3 , marking the start of her fight ' to earn your vote '			0
but this political operator was less than impressed with the news , bursting into tears and complaining that the former first lady and secretary of state had stolen his thunder			0
@entity14 , who appears to be around two years old , was overcome with emotion when @entity16 declared her second presidential bid , and insisted to his mother that 2016 is his year to shine			1
devastated : @entity14 burst into tears when @entity1 announced that she was running more experience : @entity16 , 67 , pictured above declaring her intention to run , has better @entity25 connections than @entity14 the video , uploaded by his mother @entity27 to @entity28 in the wake of the announcement , sees the would - be candidate repeatedly state his ambition to ascend to the nation 's highest office so he could ' play ... with toys '			1
he eventually concedes that playtime is not the top priority of a commander - in - chief , but is still adamant that he is up to the task			0
unfortunately , @entity14 appears not to have realized that the @entity42 @entity41 prohibits anybody from holding the presidency until they are 35			1
however , unperturbed , he eventually takes his mother 's advice and decides to run for presidency anyway			2
@entity14 admittedly lacks the campaigning experience of @entity16 , who already has to her name a period as secretary of state , a spell in the @entity55 and eight years as first lady			1
but he does have the advantage of youth over 67 - year - old @entity16 , and , unlike his more experienced rival , will not be perceived as a political insider			0
accepting ms @entity62 's campaign advice , he repeats : ' i 'm @entity14 and i 'm running for president			2
' while he has yet to articulate a policy platform , the youngster is clearly not short on ambition .			0

@entity14 was devastated by @entity16 campaign and burst into tears
@entity14 , who appears to be around two , insists he would be better candidate
his mother , @entity27 , eventually *persuades* him to go *ahead* with the run anyway

unfortunately , @entity42 @entity41 states that presidents must be at least 35
