by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 12:18 est , 20 march 2013 @entity2 lawmakers are expected to agree today to bar bankers in @entity4 from getting bonuses bigger than their salary , introducing the first cap of its kind globally			2
one of the most ambitious reforms of the financial crisis , the cap is designed to address public anger at a bonus - driven culture many @entity4 politicians believe encouraged the risk - taking that pulled down banks and governments			2
it is set to be introduced from next year despite the objections of @entity20			1
the chancellor fears capping bankers ' bonuses will lead to an exodus from the @entity26 to other financial centres , like @entity28 the defeat is a significant blow to the @entity20 , which had argued a bonus cap would have a disproportionate impact on the @entity26			1
it will raise fresh concerns about @entity20 ’s ability to defend the @entity36 from a wave of financial regulations being plotted by @entity39			2
defeat : @entity20 's finance minister , @entity40 , tried to change the rules at a meeting of @entity2 finance ministers but no one supported him finance leaders fears the rules will drive away talent and restrict growth			1
while some token concessions are possible to show goodwill towards the bloc 's financial hub of @entity55 , the decision on a cap will not be reversed			1
@entity2 officials indicated that there could be a further delay to the introduction of the new rules until the middle of 2014 to allow countries time to complete legal preparations - a delay that could spare bankers for one more bonus season			2
lawmakers from the @entity68 and diplomats representing @entity2 countries are to begin talks on finalising the bonus rules at 1730 gmt. @entity73 expect a deal to be clinched			0
' this was a sobering experience , ' said one official familiar with @entity20 thinking , who asked not to be named			0
' it 's the first time the @entity20 was outvoted on financial services			2
' there are autopsies being carried out at the @entity83			0
they will only ask for marginal changes but they can not change the fundamental direction , ' he said			0
one @entity4 diplomat predicted only ' minor tweaks '			0
the rules , part of a wider capital regime for banks , would limit banker bonuses to the equivalent of their salary , or two times their salary if shareholders agree			1
they represent the toughest bonus regime anywhere in the world			1
earlier this month , @entity20 's finance minister , @entity40 , tried to change the rules at a meeting of @entity2 finance ministers but no one supported him			1
his inability to fend off the reform underscored @entity20 's waning influence in the @entity2 and is also likely to fuel deepening euro scepticism in @entity20			1
consequences : mr @entity40 warned a cap on bonuses could result in banks pushing up salaries to top executives , which would be even harder to claw back in the event of failure at the time employers ’ organisation the @entity119 reacted with dismay , saying : ‘ the proposals will damage the competitiveness of the @entity2 ’s financial services industry , hitting the @entity20 particularly hard , at a time when growth should be the key priority			1
’ @entity129 said @entity130 had ‘ real concerns ’ about the proposals , while @entity55 mayor @entity131 said the ‘ deluded ’ plan would simply drive top bankers overseas			0

last month @entity129 said @entity130 , left , had ‘ real concerns ’ about the proposals , while @entity55 mayor @entity131 , right , said the ‘ deluded ’ plan would simply drive top bankers overseas ‘ our concern is that it may have a perverse effect , it may undermine responsibility in the banking system rather than promote it , ’ he said			0
the cap has already been softened by allowing banks to discount the future value of share options , bonds or other non-cash payments paid out over more than five years			0
as it stands , one quarter of a banker 's bonus can be paid in this way but , in an attempt to soften the blow for @entity20 , this ratio could be raised in the final round of negotiations			1
such alterations , however , would have only a slight impact on the total amount of bonus that can be paid			0
furthermore , any changes will require the approval of the @entity68 , which pushed for the clampdown in a wider law that chiefly deals with increasing the capital that banks hold to make them safer .			0

changes *threaten* @entity20 's financial industry the most
