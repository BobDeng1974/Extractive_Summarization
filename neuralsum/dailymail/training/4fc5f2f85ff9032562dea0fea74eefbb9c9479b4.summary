training days : @entity3 continue their preparations for the @entity7 during their camp in @entity6 but with the @entity3 players losing so much sweat training in the heat and humidity of @entity26 to prepare for the conditions they will face in @entity29 , @entity2 has decided a little extra salt and sugar from the sauces will do no harm			1
butter â € “ previously banned for its high salt and fat content â € “ is also back on the menu			1
even in the cooler climes of @entity40 and @entity41 - upon - @entity42 , the @entity3 management have tried to recreate @entity44 conditions by making the players wear several layers so they sweat more			2

' when we were in @entity40 we wore underarmour , t - shirts , zip up tops and a wet top over that , ' the @entity3 goalkeeper said			2
saucy : @entity3 's players will be allowed ketchup and brown sauce during the @entity7 ' when it was 22 degrees ( centigrade ) the lads were losing 2kg in sweat in every training session			1
' we are trying to replicate the heat and humidity ( of @entity29 ) ' even at @entity79 last week we trained in the morning , lunch , slept for an hour and then did bike sessions in heat chambers to get ready			2
' we 've been doing half hour sessions in there			0
it 's brutal , really hard work			0
but no - one 's grumbled or moaned about it , just got on with it			0
' @entity2 has left no stone unturned in his bid to get the players in the best possible condition for the @entity7			0
