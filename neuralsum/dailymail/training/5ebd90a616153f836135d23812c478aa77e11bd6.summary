if you are looking for an excuse to have a more active love life , a new study may help			0
scientists believe that sex helps humans avoid disease by wiping out genetic mutations			2
by analysing hundreds of people ’s dna , they found that disease - enabling mutations gradually vanish from human genes			1
but @entity13 who have a lot of casual sex wo n’t benefit from a life free from illness , because the process takes hundreds of generations			1
scientists claim that sex helps humans avoid diseases by gradually wiping out genetic mutations			2
by analysing hundreds of people ’s genetic code , they have found that disease - enabling mutations vanish from humans ’ genes for decades , scientists have debated the genetic advantages of sexual reproduction			1
now , researchers from the @entity33 and the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , have just shown how humanity becomes less likely to develop or catch diseases the more we mix our genetic material together			1
previous research has revealed that as humans procreate , generation after generation , the exchange of genetic material between man and woman causes our species to evolve little by little			0
the chromosomes of parents - threadlike structures made of nucleic acids and protein found in the nucleus of most living cells , which carry genetic information in the form of genes - recombine to create the chromosomes of their child , but they do n’t mix together in a uniform way			2
scinetists found that chromosomes ( pictured ) recombine frequently in some segments of the genome and less in others , which tend to carry a significantly greater proportion of genetic mutations that can cause disease			0
these segments accumulate more bad mutations until they are recombined the researchers studied the sequenced genomes of hundreds of individuals from @entity36 's @entity78 genetic data repository and the multinational 1,000 @entity79			1
they found that the proportion of mutations associated with disease was significantly higher in low recombining segments of genomes known as ‘ coldspots ’ relative to highly recombining regions			0
they also discovered that the bad mutations in these coldspots were more damaging than the mutations in the highly recombining segments			0
the team compared the finding across four populations : @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity36 of @entity99 descent			0
genomes from each of the genetic groups exhibited the behaviour they expected to varying degrees			0
@entity95 individuals showed the smallest relative proportion of disease - associated mutations on their genome 's coldspots , while @entity110 @entity97 showed the largest			1
the experts found that chromosomes recombine frequently in some segments of the genome and less in others , which may take many generations to eventually recombine			0
using biological samples and genetic data from different populations around the globe , the researchers found that the segments of the human genome that do n't recombine as often as others , tend to carry a significantly greater proportion of genetic mutations that can cause diseases			1
these segments accumulate more bad mutations until they are recombined , meaning that our genetic material gets worse before it gets better			0
but thanks to sex , mutations that cause diseases are eventually wiped out from humans ’ genetic code			1
dr @entity137 , who led the study , said : ' since these mutations rest on less dynamic segments of our genome , the process can potentially take many hundreds of generations			1
’ ‘ this discovery gives us a better understanding of how we , as humans , become more or less at risk of developing or contracting diseases			2
’ the study also gives scientists a better idea of where to look for mutations that cause disease , in the human genome , which could speed up the discovery and identification of mutations associated with a number of illnesses .			0

researchers from the @entity33 and @entity34 studied hundreds of people ’s genetic code
they found that disease - enabling mutations vanish from humans ’ genes
but unfortunately the process takes hundreds of generations
study could hint how humans become more at risk of developing diseases
