these are toxic times on @entity1 but the thousands of supporters who boycotted were at least spared another dispiriting display which equalled a club - record rot of six straight defeats in the @entity7			1
were it not for a freaky five wins on the spin last autumn , the @entity8 would be headed for the @entity11			0
in fact , head coach @entity12 fears his side – the worst in the division on present form – could yet plummet towards the bottom three			2
‘ we are in amongst a relegation battle			0
@entity27 , for example , are winning games , but we are n’t , ’ he said after goals from @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 ’s 30th of the season condemned them to a 10th loss in 14			1
@entity20 celebrates after the @entity31 midfielder 's curling free - kick misses his team - mates and @entity33 in the @entity35 goal @entity19 tries his luck from 30 yards out to open the scoring for @entity38 on the half - hour mark with a well - placed left - footed strike @entity35 players join @entity42 as the hard - working midfielder pounces on a loose ball in the penalty area @entity21 celebrates putting the result beyond doubt as @entity38 claim a 3 - 1 win over @entity35 , who sink to a sixth loss on the bounce @entity35 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity33 4 ; @entity52 6.5 , @entity53 6 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 6 ( @entity56 75 , 6 ) ; @entity57 6 ; gouffran 4.5 ( @entity58 46 , 6 ) , @entity42 6.5 , @entity59 4.5 ( @entity60 46 , 6 ) , @entity61 5.5 ; @entity62 6.5 subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 scorers : @entity42 46 bookings : @entity42 , @entity61 @entity38 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity70 ; @entity71 6 , @entity72 7 , @entity73 6 , @entity74 6.5 ( @entity75 81 ) ; @entity76 6.5 ( @entity77 88 ) , @entity78 6.5 ; @entity79 6 , @entity80 7.5 ( @entity81 78 ) , @entity20 7 ; @entity21 6.5 subs not used : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 scorers : @entity19 30 , @entity20 53 , @entity21 90 bookings : @entity79 , @entity72 , @entity76 , @entity78 referee : @entity90 : 47 , 427 @entity91 : @entity19 @entity20 's free - kick goes direction in from out wide for the winner - click here to see more from @entity97 's match zone ‘ i ’m angry			1
it ’s another defeat and that ’s not good enough			0
this is the most difficult situation i ’ve ever been in but i ’m not going to give up on it			0
’ although the official attendance was returned as a massively inaccurate 47 , 427 – making it the biggest of the weekend in the top - flight – estimates had it nearer 40,000 as fans stayed away in protest at @entity110 ’s running of the club , which this month returned record profits of £ 18.7million before revealing they have a further £ 34m in the bank			1
the billionaire will need to part with a sizeable chunk of that cash this summer if @entity35 are to avoid a season - long struggle against relegation next time around			1
one banner – unfurled during a pre-match protest outside of the @entity121 – captured the mood of frustration and mistrust among supporters – ‘ @entity35 – balance sheet champions , 2008 - 2014 ’			2
@entity97 ’s @entity126 , meanwhile , launched a scathing attack on @entity110			2
‘ people will say as supporters you ’ve got to come back , you ’ve got to get behind your team			0
but what are the owners doing for supporters ? ’ he said			0
‘ since @entity110 ’s been here they ’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated again			2
‘ so he ’s balanced the books and he ’s made money because he ’s a businessman , but i think of these people and wonder , “ do n’t you want to be excited yourself ? ”			0
‘ i ’m getting bored by @entity35			0
why does @entity110 want the club if there ’s nothing happening ? there ’s no cup run , i just do n’t get it			0
i do n’t get why he wants to own a football club			0
’ the defeat leaves @entity35 seven points above the drop zone and @entity12 has previously confessed that he does not know where their next point is coming from			1
@entity38 striker @entity21 at full stretch with of @entity38 is chased down by @entity35 captain @entity54 after @entity21 was chosen as caretaker of the captain 's armband , @entity152 returned to lead @entity38 at @entity156 @entity21 is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of @entity35 's @entity160 on this evidence , they may well have to rely on their current tally of 35 being enough			1
they were hardly helped here by @entity33			0
but perhaps the loss of form of the usually - dependable goalkeeper best represents the problems which have plagued the squad in recent weeks			0
the @entity173 stopper could have done more to keep out @entity19 ’s first - half opener and was again culpable as @entity20 struck to restore the lead after @entity42 had levelled early in the second half			1
@entity19 appeared to have exhausted his options as he floated in possession 25 yards from goal only to drop his shoulder before slamming into the bottom corner with @entity33 sluggish in his pursuit of the strike			1
@entity12 reacted to an insipid first half by hooking the ineffective @entity185 and midfielder @entity59 and within 20 seconds they were level when @entity42 steamed onto a loose ball inside the area before slotting home			1
@entity19 was given space outside the box and pulled the trigger just as @entity35 midfielder @entity42 arrived in defence @entity42 is too late as the @entity197 laces his shot from range and it nestles in the bottom corner giving @entity35 keeper @entity33 no chance @entity202 celebrates after scoring the goal to send @entity38 on their way on a tough day for @entity35 amid fan protests @entity19 leaps in the air with delight after his sublime strike for the opening goal of the match @entity20 ( left ) tussles with @entity35 's @entity212 at @entity156 on sunday but parity was to last just eight minutes and @entity20 ’s free - kick – intended as a cross – bounced through the weak grasp of @entity33 and into the back of the net			1
@entity33 , in fairness , made a string of fine stops to keep @entity35 within one but he was powerless to prevent @entity21 rolling beyond him in stoppage - time after he had skipped onto @entity79 ’s through - ball			1
in doing so @entity21 became the first @entity38 player since @entity224 in 1992 to score 30 goals in one season			2
and the @entity228 striker now has @entity224 ’s total of 35 in his sights			0
@entity42 is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise for @entity35 @entity42 jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season , all of which have been scored at @entity35 's home @entity156 fans applaud while one holds up a ' @entity242 , no @entity110 ' sign , while @entity42 's @entity35 team - mates join in the celebrations ‘ i 'm very proud but there are five games left and , hopefully , i 'll get a few more goals , ’ he said			1
manager @entity248 added : ‘ we were better than @entity35 and deserved the win			2
‘ for @entity21 , it is a fantastic achievement			0
we need to push him now because he has a lot of improvement left in him			0
’ @entity35 , meanwhile , will also need to improve in the final five matches of their sorry season , or risk starting next in the second tier			2
@entity20 ( right punching the air ) and @entity38 celebrate after his free - kick saw them regain the lead against @entity35 @entity35 keeper @entity33 is left stranded as @entity20 's free - kick misses a line of his own players and curls into the back of the net @entity38 midfielder @entity79 ( centre ) gets a talking to before a yellow card comes his way after a sliding tackle on @entity273 @entity21 calmly slots @entity38 's third goal in time added on after coming one - on - one with @entity33 @entity21 's goal after a quiet game by the prolific striker 's standards brings him back level with @entity281 as the @entity7 's top scorer a less than full stand at @entity156 watches the action on sunday between @entity35 and @entity38 a plane hired by the supporters of rivals @entity285 heap misery on @entity35 with a reminder their last five consecutive derby losses ' we do n't demand a team that wins , we demand a team that tries , ' reads a banner erected outside @entity156 on sunday a young boy holds up one of the hundreds of @entity298 flyers handed out before the match			1

@entity19 opened the scoring with a left - footed strike from outside the box on the half - hour mark
@entity42 equalised for the home side immediately after half - time after the ball fell kindly in the area
@entity20 won @entity38 the lead back with the @entity31 's curling free - kick missing everyone
@entity21 topped off a relatively quiet game with a *runaway* goal after regular time was up
@entity35 have now lost six consecutive @entity7 matches under manager @entity12
fans protested before and during the match against owner @entity110 's *perceived* lack of *ambition*
