by @entity0 for @entity1 clattering through the air like skittles cleaned up by a bowling ball , these @entity3 forcados really struggled to grab the bull by the horns			2
the huge , black beast appears to be coming out very much on top as it brushes aside the unarmed bullfighters - despite the fact that it has been stabbed in the back of the neck with three javelins			0
the bull knocked several of the @entity17 group head over heels during the event at the @entity20 in @entity21 yesterday			1
dressed in their ornate jackets and knee - high socks , the fighters looked like little more than plastic toy soldiers as they were tossed around the ring			0
@entity3 bullfighting differs from the @entity29 method as it involves eight forcados tackling the bull bare - handed , while @entity29 matadors are armed and have their traditional red cape			1
the @entity3 tradition also says that the bull should not be killed in the ring - though it is usually led off out of the audience 's sight to be slaughtered after the fight			2
a @entity3 bullfight starts with the cavaleiro - an armed horseman - stabbing the bull in the back with javelins to weaken it			0
it then tackled the forcados , who try and provoke it to charge in the hope of eventually grabbing it by the head and subduing it			0
double strike : the huge , black bull clatters two of the forcados into the air as they try and grab it by the head in the hope of subduing it head over heels : one of the bullfighters is flipped over by the beast as he makes as grab for its horns , while the others run in worriedly to assist ten - pin bulling : the bull knocks a shoe off one of the fighters as four more stand in wait behind him - the next in line screaming out in fear @entity77 - to - head : the bull and a brave forcado tackle each other head on as the seven other fighters spot a chance to jump in and grab the animal brushed aside : the bull has absolutely no trouble in swiping away a lone forcado , despite the three javelins sticking deep into the back of its neck seizing the opportunity : as one fighters is tackled to the floor , two more of the unarmed men step in to try to grab it by the head and take it down hold on tight ! a forcado grabs onto the bull 's head and holds on for dear life as the beast tries to flip him angrily onto the sand you 're pulling my tail : a bullfighter with a ripped jacket attempts to stop the bull from behind as another scarpers off quickly in the other direction time to kick back : the forcados relax after the fight , with one lighting a cigarette to calm his nerves after being tossed all over the @entity21 ring			1

@entity121 forcados group took on the huge , black bull at the @entity20 in @entity21 yesterday
*unlike* @entity29 matadors , @entity3 bullfighters are unarmed , and the bull is not killed in the ring
