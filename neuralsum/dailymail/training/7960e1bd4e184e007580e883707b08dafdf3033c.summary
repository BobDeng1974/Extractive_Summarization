@entity5 , has been accused of sending @entity7 socialite @entity6 sexual photos of himself after she contacted him for help about threatening emails she had received from @entity4 ' biographer - turned - mistress @entity12			1

emails to a friend : socialite @entity6 arrives home in @entity7 on tuesday night ' that picture was sent years before @entity6 contacted him about this , and it was sent as part of a larger context of what i would call social relations in which the families would exchange numerous photos of each other , ' said @entity53			1
claiming that the picture was sent as a ' joke ' , @entity53 said that @entity5 was ' posing with a couple of dummies ' at the time of the photograph and that it was not sexual in nature			1
