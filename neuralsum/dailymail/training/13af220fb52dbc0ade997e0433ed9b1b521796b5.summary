@entity1 is developing 3d video calls that could eventually allow workers to send body doubles to meetings ' we have it in the lab , we know how to make it work and we 're looking at the ecosystem of devices and their capability to support it in order to make a decision when we might think about bringing something like that to market , ' he told the @entity34			1
@entity1 , which is owned by @entity35 and marks its 10th anniversary today , hinted at its plans in april when it released an advertisement telling viewers it was searching for a way to create ' body doubles ' for workers unable to travel to meetings			2

it ran a pilot scheme in which it televised a number of programmes in @entity50 including @entity60 and the ceremonies for the @entity62 last year			0
since its launch , @entity1 has clocked up more than 1.4 trillion minutes of voice and video calls , which is the equivalent of over 2.6 million years of conversations , made in just a decade but while an estimated 1.5 million homes have tv sets that can run the technology , only around half of the homes which could watch @entity73 2012 in @entity50 did so			1
