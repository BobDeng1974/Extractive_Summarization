@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7			0
@entity8 was unquestionably man of the match in @entity11 ’s 2 - 0 win at @entity12 , but the @entity14 ’ unsung hero was centre - forward @entity15			1
the @entity17 ’s work rate set the tone for his team , harrying @entity12 ’s defenders and making himself available as an outlet when @entity11 broke			2
@entity15 ran 7.4 miles , the furthest of any player on the @entity24 pitch – and in marked contrast to opposing front man @entity27 ’s total of 5.8 miles			1
for good measure he also headed home the second goal that clinched the game – his seventh of an injury hit season in which he was starting for only the eighth time			0
@entity8 put in an impressive performance for @entity11 on sunday as they beat @entity12 2 - 0 @entity15 ran 7.4 miles - the furthest of any player at the @entity24 on sunday during @entity11 's win 2			1
@entity40 will feel more and more confident of regularly selling the 54,000 seats in their new @entity43 home			1
sunday ’s official gate of 34,914 for the 3 - 0 romp over @entity46 was just 102 below @entity48 ’s official capacity , a significant crowd for a game that was live on tv and against one of the @entity5 ’s less glamorous clubs			1
the @entity40 , who move to @entity55 in 2016 , have sold out all 11 of their @entity5 home games so far			2
@entity40 will feel more confident of regularly selling the 54,000 seats in their new @entity43 home @entity0 examine the curious goings - on at @entity59 since @entity61 's arrival 3			1
@entity62 is unquestionably a brilliant wide man but he ca n’t play as a central striker in the way @entity65 tried to use him in the first half at @entity67			1
the slightly built @entity68 did n’t have the strength to hold the ball up			0
he gave it away 22 times at @entity74 and won only three of 14 duels against defenders			0
@entity62 is unquestionably a brilliant wide man but ca n’t play as a central striker for @entity65 @entity65 tried to use @entity62 as a central striker in the first half at @entity67 4			1
@entity80 ’s astonishing production line of academy talent never seems to stop producing players – the latest is 19 - year - old @entity83 who helped manager @entity84 make light of the absence of his key midfield pair @entity87 and @entity88			1
@entity89 - born @entity83 gave the ball away only eight times in 90 minutes at @entity92 , and came out on top in every one of the four tackles he contested			2
it helped @entity84 ’s side wrap up three away wins in a week – taking them to 10 wins on their travels in all this season , the most the club have ever achieved in a @entity5 campaign			0
@entity80 's academy talent never seems to stop coming and 19 - year - old @entity83 is the latest ( left ) 5			1
@entity103 are hoping that new @entity105 midfielder @entity104 can provide the attacking verve from midfield they need – and that his debut was a sign of things to come			1
the 22 - year - old livened up another drab @entity103 display after replacing @entity113 with half an hour to go			1
in his time on the pitch he played more passes , won more tackles and made more chances than on - loan @entity120 and former @entity122 star @entity113 had managed in the previous 60 minutes			0
he also ran 2.8 miles – two thirds of the total distance covered in half the time compared to @entity113			2
@entity103 are hoping that new @entity105 midfielder @entity104 can provide the attacking prowess they crave 6			1
@entity127 , who celebrated his 31st birthday last week , is out of contract in the summer and has yet to agree a new deal at @entity131 because the club prefer not to give more than 12 months to players in their thirties			0
the @entity136 midfielder is making a strong case to be treated as an exception to the rule , though			0
he made the team tick in the 1 - 0 win at @entity142 , completing more passes ( 64 ) than anybody else , with two thirds of them in the attacking half			0
@entity148 and @entity149 were the only two @entity131 players who ran further than his 6.9 miles			2
@entity127 celebrated his 31st birthday but is out of contract in the summer with @entity131 7			0
perhaps @entity127 could give a call for some support to his @entity155 team - mate @entity154 , who will be 34 in april but signed in october a contract that keeps him at @entity157 until the summer of 2017			0
the central defender is proof that age need be no barrier to playing in the @entity5			0
after @entity127 ’s team - mate @entity161 was ruled out by injury on saturday , @entity154 is now the only top flight outfield player this season to have appeared for every minute of every game in every competition			2
@entity127 could give a call for some support to his @entity155 team - mate @entity154 ( right ) , who turns 34 in april 8			0
@entity169 international midfielder @entity168 was one of the few players to survive the massive clearout undertaken by @entity172 when he took over at @entity173 – and is beginning to look a key figure in the club ’s ambition to return to the @entity5			2
the 28 - year - old scored his fourth goal in three games in the 2 - 0 win over @entity181 that moved the @entity183 club to within a point of the @entity186 play - offs			1
@entity168 ( left ) was one of the few players to survive the massive clearout undertaken by @entity172 9			0
@entity188 , where manager @entity189 insists on expansive passing football , are establishing a reputation as the destination of choice for @entity5 clubs to send their most promising youngsters for loan spells			0
the latest to arrive at the @entity198 is @entity200 ’s 19 - year - old @entity199 , a @entity201 born midfielder whose goal - scoring at youth level has led to him being dubbed the next @entity204			1
he lived up to the reputation , scoring one and making another as the @entity206 beat @entity207 3 - 1 to stay top of the @entity210 table			0
@entity200 ’s 19 - year - old @entity199 has been dubbed the next @entity204 and arrived at @entity188 on loan 10			1
@entity212 is a name that @entity120 will need to be aware of before they arrive at @entity215 on friday night for a potentially tricky @entity217 fourth round tie			0
the 19 - year - old , who started out at @entity219 and then @entity200 before being let go , has just signed for @entity221 ’s team on a loan from his current club @entity223			1
the @entity224 under 21 international has been cleared to play against @entity65 ’s side – and warmed up with two goals on his @entity228 debut in a 4 - 0 romp against @entity230			2
@entity212 ( left ) is a name that @entity120 will need to be aware of before their @entity217 tie			0

@entity11 's @entity15 ran 7.4 miles against @entity12 - the most of any player at the @entity24 - while @entity27 ran just 5.8 miles
@entity40 will feel more confident of filling 54,000 seats in their @entity43 home after sunday ’s gate of 34,914 - just 102 below capacity
@entity62 is a brilliant wide man but can not play as a central striker
@entity80 ’s astonishing production line of academy talent never seems to stop producing players - and the latest is 19 - year - old @entity83
@entity103 are hoping new @entity105 midfielder @entity104 can provide a *creative* spark and his debut was a sign of things to come
