sticky labels on supermarket fruits are set to be replaced by laser ' tattoos ' printed onto their skin , under new rulings from the @entity6			1
the @entity6 approved the use of iron oxides and hydroxides in lasering citrus fruit , melons and pomegranates last week and the law comes into force from 23 june			1
although the technology has been around since 2009 , the use of these chemicals - which enhance the contrast between the lasered and non-lasered parts of the fruit making the mark much clearer - had previously been banned			1
a new ruling by the @entity6 means grocers and retailers can now use lasers with iron oxides , hydroxides and other e-numbers to ' tattoo ' the skin of fruit			1
these lasered marks can contain barcodes or fruit information and could be used to replace sticky labels from 23 june , shops in the @entity6 can laser branding information to the skin of fruits			1
suppliers can use the technology to trace where their products are picked and where they 're sold retailers and suppliers can use the ' tattoos ' to mark the fruit and track where it has been and where it is sold			1
under the new ruling they can additionally add barcodes or other information to the skin of fruits which removes the need for sticky labels			1
trade magazine @entity56 said that the previous ban on the chemicals hindered the adoption of lasering and the publication , along with suppliers , have welcomed the @entity6 's decision			1
the company behind the technology is @entity68 - based @entity67			1
it has spent three years liasing with the @entity6 to get the use of iron oxides and hydoroxides approved			1
it claims that one of the main benefits of laser technology is ' improved traceability for shoppers			2
' @entity79 , managing director of @entity67 , told @entity80 : ' consumers will have absolute certainty the product they are buying is fully guaranteed			0
' he said that currently loose products were removed from cartons and sold ' anonymously			0
' @entity87 would also bring considerable cost advantages and environmental savings for retailers and suppliers as it would remove the need for paper , ink and glue typically used in sticky labels to add information and branding to fresh produce			1
mr @entity79 added : ' it limits the risk of losing , mixing up or inverting food items and therefore facilitates transportation and storage			0
' the @entity6 ruling applies to lasering citrus fruits , such as oranges ( pictured ) , melons and pomegranates			1
@entity68 - based company @entity67 , which develops the technology behind the ruling , worked with the @entity6 to get approval			1
it has previously branded fruits with @entity115 badges and other sporting brands suppliers also believe the hi - tech change will provide a huge marketing opportunity for retailers as the lasering could be used as a promotional tool to mark products with motifs during special events during the year			1
for example , @entity67 has previously marked fruit with the @entity115 football club badge			2
the company has also previously branded fruit with the @entity132 logo			2
the amended @entity6 regulations now allows the use of iron oxides , hydroxides , hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polysorbates for marking certain fruits			2
these are all examples of so called e-numbers and can be used to create a contrast between the laser marking and the fruit 's skin			2
iron oxides and hyrdoxides are know as @entity148			2
they are natural minerals commercially made from iron powder which can be yellow , red , orange , brown or black in colour			2
manufactured by treating a solution of ferrous sulphate or chloride with an alkali and oxidising the precipitate in hot air			0
as the iron present in these oxides is in the ferric form it is not very actively available to body tissues			0
@entity148 can be found in cake and dessert mixes , meat paste , salmon and shrimp paste			0
they are only used for coating the surfaces of things but are safe to eat because they are not absorbed into the body			0
@entity174 ( @entity175 ) is made from cellulose and commercially prepared from wood and chemically modified			0
it is mainly used as a thickening agent , but also as filler , dietary fibre , anti clumping agent and emulsfier			0
@entity184 cellulose is soluble and can be fermented in the large intestine			0
large doses can cause intestinal problems , such as bloating , constipation and diarrhoea			0
@entity191 ( e 432 - 436 ) is a synthetic compound made from ethylene oxide , sorbitol and lauric acid - a naturally occurring fatty acid			0
it is mainly found in ice cream and soft drinks			0
humans can take in 25mg for each kg of body weight and there are no known side effects , although people intolerant of propylene glycol should avoid the @entity207 .			0

latest @entity6 ruling allows grocers and retailers to use hi - tech lasers to mark the skin of fruit
the approval applies to citrus fruit , melons and pomegranates
laser fruit tattoos can replace sticky labels and the iron - based chemicals were previously banned
