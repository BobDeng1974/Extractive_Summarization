the 24 - year - old initially claimed he had got his injury from falling off a motorbike , but later pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm			2
yesterday he was sentenced to 12 years and nine months in prison at @entity17			0
the fight began at a newsagent in @entity20 in october last year when two rival gangs began attacking each other			1
@entity1 was not initially at the scene , but when friends called him for ' back - up ' he arrived armed with a meat cleaver , and dragged mr @entity8 out of the shop			1
@entity28 , prosecuting , said : ' @entity1 can be seen to approach the shop , he drags @entity8 from the shop where he fell to the floor			2
at that point mr @entity1 rains blows down on him , about 15 times mostly to his head , back and neck			1
' it was a ferocious attack , so ferocious that the defendant 's arm went limp and he struck his own arm with the cleaver causing himself serious injury			0
' mr @entity8 , who was jailed for affray earlier this year , refused to make a complaint , but the paramedics who treated him called the police to arrest @entity1			2
attack : @entity1 hacked at @entity8 with a meat cleaver 15 times during the incident last year @entity49 : the brutal assault was caught on surveillance cameras outside a newsagent in @entity20 , @entity53 the victim suffered cuts to his head , ears , legs and neck , and his left arm had all of its tendons severed , leaving him with long - term mobility problems in his arm			1
the defendant claimed he was innocent , saying he was not at the scene , but later admitted his guilt			0
the court heard he had previous convictions for smashing someone in the face with a brick and knocking a man unconscious by hitting him on the head with a lump of wood studded with nails			0
judge @entity78 told @entity1 : ' this offence marks a meteoric rise in seriousness			0
injury : the attack only ended when @entity1 struck himself in the arm with his own weapon ' despite your age and room for maturity in the future the sheer ferocity of the attack has to be seen on dvd to be believed			2
' the fact that you took a lethal weapon to the scene allied to your previous offences , which i can not ignore , drives me to the conclusion that you currently present a substantial risk of serious harm to those with whom you are in confrontation			0
you are a dangerous offender			0
