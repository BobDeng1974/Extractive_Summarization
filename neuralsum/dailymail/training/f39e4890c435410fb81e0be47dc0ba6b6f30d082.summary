by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:44 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 05:47 est , 3 november 2012 it 's a local bar with a difference - the difference being its locality			1
welcome to @entity6 , not at the end of the street but plonked right in the middle			0
just days ago this was part of the @entity11 , summer hangout at @entity14 's shore			1
until it was ripped from its moorings by @entity17 and delivered to @entity18 , according to the people living there			1
incredible : the @entity11 bar was swept for seven miles from the @entity14 area of @entity24 to this location in @entity18 how it used to look : the @entity11 in @entity14 before its extraordinary journey			1
it turned up in @entity18 complete with tables and chairs , shot glasses and an impressively stocked bar an incredible journey of around seven miles , across the bay and made even more remarkable by the fact that it turned up complete with tables and chairs , shot glasses and an impressively stocked bar			1
with its clapboard walls and freshly painted window sills it looks like something straight out of @entity44 of @entity45 little wonder one local speculated that it had been picked up by the wind and dropped where it sat on @entity50 , @entity18			1
in fact one man knew exactly what had happened			0
astonishing : the @entity11 floated into @entity18 on floodwaters , ending up in the middle of a street			1
locals quickly renamed it ' @entity6 ' intact : the building 's interior remained in remarkably good condition despite the extraordinary seven - mile journey venue : @entity18 resident @entity63 enjoys a beer in the abandoned bar which turned up in the middle of his street surprise : the residents of @entity18 could hardly believe their luck when a readily available supply of alcohol floated into their neighborhood refreshments : some of the drinks found in the bar when the @entity11 turned up in @entity18 relief : residents of @entity18 , @entity78 , took the opportunity to have a break from the misery when they found the bar was fully stocked having a drink : some of the revellers who enjoyed themselves when the @entity11 washed up in @entity18 , @entity78 unexpected pleasure : @entity18 resident @entity63 takes a drink after the @entity11 swept into his neighborhood ( left ) , and a reveller dances the night away ( right ) @entity89 , 42 , witnessed the arrival of the bar , thought to be a portion of the @entity11 that was n't flattened by the storm			1
he said : ' i looked out my bedroom window and i saw what looked like a house just flying past			0
the water must have been five , six feet deep			0
' i said , " @entity101 we 're in trouble ! ' it came in @entity104 and smashed my gazebo , through my gate , ran over a car and just went down the road about five miles an hour like a steamroller			0
' cycling up to where the bar sat askew @entity63 , a resident of @entity112 for 17 years joked , ' i told them to park my bar and look where they put it			2
you ca n't get the help			0
' according to resident @entity121 , ' all of us here , we 'd had the panic we 'd been through hell and the day after the storm we 'd worked all day to save what we could			0
journey : this illustration shows how the bar was swept out into the water from its original location in @entity14 before being washed up at @entity18 , @entity78			1
witnesses said it was travelling in floodwater up to six feet deep renamed : the revellers called the bar ' @entity6 ' after the superstorm and marked ' byob ' on the side of it to instruct guests to bring their own bottles when the drink ran out ... ... but the fun could n't last forever , and the police ordered for the bar to be demolished and cleared away condemned : the digger reduces the venue to a pile of debris under police direction fun over : partygoer @entity151 stands in front of the debris after police ordered for the bar to be demolished ' there 's this bar - it 's got @entity159 , @entity160 , 12 year old @entity161 , vodka and cases of @entity164 ... well what were we going to do ? we had a party			2
we needed to let off steam			0
' once stocks ran out the bar , believed to be the @entity170 part of the @entity11 bar , operated a strict @entity173 policy			1
it turned out to be a last hoorah for the bar			2
by late afternoon the police had turned up			0
believing they were there to remove a fibre glass boat they were initially utterly bemused by what they found			0
but ultimately , and to boos from the good - natured locals , they called time on the @entity11 / @entity6 , breaking it up and clearing it away			2
destruction : the @entity14 area of @entity24 was devastated by @entity17 , with flooding and fires wrecking homes and businesses			2

the @entity11 was ripped from its moorings on @entity14 's shore
it ended up at @entity18 , complete with its bar and *furniture*
