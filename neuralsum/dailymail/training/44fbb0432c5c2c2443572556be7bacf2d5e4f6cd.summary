by @entity0 @entity2 's loftiest teen is set to become the world 's tallest bride after her compact fiancee popped the big question			2
aspiring model @entity7 - who is a staggering 6ft 8ins tall - has been dating 5ft 4ins @entity9 for more than three years			1
despite a massive 1ft 4ins between them , @entity9 had no problem increasing the distance by dropping to one knee after a romantic stroll along the beach			1
@entity7 is so stuck on having a child that she is willing to adopt if she does not fall pregnant soon - despite being only 18			1
the youngster is worried that she may not conceive because of a form of gigantism that was caused when a tumour grew on her pituitary gland			1
despite this the couple are still looking forward to a long and happy life together			1
remembering the romantic proposal , @entity7 said : ' i told him many times , ' do not ask me to marry you because my answer will be no ' - i think that 's what he was thinking			1
' i was so nervous when i saw him there			2
i do n't even know how i coped			2
' construction worker @entity9 added : ' i have always wanted to go out with a tall girl and she came and fitted into that perfectly			1
' despite planning a long engagement , @entity7 has already picked out her wedding dress @entity7 's height still draws stares , even in her hometown , but @entity9 says the attention does n't bother him and he is proud to show her off the couple are planning on a long engagement despite @entity7 already having a dress for the big day			1
' we think how will the preparations for the wedding be , the church , the best men and bridesmaids , ' added @entity9			1
' we have taken just one step towards the wedding - which was me asking her to marry me			2
' we are giving it some time to get it all in order			2
' the newly engaged couple have not always seen eye to eye and @entity9 had to work hard to get the ring on @entity7 's finger			1
' when we met i had already turned 16 , ' she said			2
' i was still a bit childish and so i was just playing around with him for a while and i got so annoyed with him - as if he was a rival that i hated			2
' i just did n't like him and wanted to hit him every time we met			0
' but little @entity9 has a big heart and remembers their meeting a little differently			1
he said : ' the first time i saw her i went to get some bread and i noticed her from a distance			0
' i checked her out and she also checked me out straight away			0
' then i just thought , " i need to be with that girl "			0
i always found her beautiful			0
' the newly engaged couple have not always seen eye to eye and @entity9 had to work hard to get the ring on @entity7 's finger , but the couple now can not wait to wed and the hate eventually turned to love for @entity7 when she became jealous of @entity9 's prowess with the ladies			1
' he was talking to another girl and i was jealous , ' she said			0
' he intrigued me - i wanted to know more about him			0
' despite the pair being completely in love , not everyone is as happy about the new engagement			1
@entity7 's mother , @entity103 , said : ' i do n't know how this could happen - this proposal			2
' it was a surprise - no - one was expecting it			0
@entity7 seen here as a young , aspiring model , is so stuck on having a child that she is willing to adopt if she does not fall pregnant soon - despite being only 18 ' in spite of everything she is still a very young girl with a lot ahead of her			1
' she is sometimes a bit difficult to him but i 've never seen him treating her badly			0
' he has been an excellent person			0
' @entity7 still draws stares while walking down the street where she has lived her entire life and is often referred to as the giant girl			1
@entity9 said : ' i keep telling her to get out more so that people do n't feel so curious about her			2
' when we go for a walk people keep staring saying ' look at that giant girl '			0
' it really bothers me because people do n't have the consciousness of thinking that she 's also a human being			0
' but despite drawing stares @entity9 can not wait to show off his new fiancie			1
he added : ' am always boasting about being with her			0
' everyone thinks she is beautiful - my friends think she is beautiful			0
' they always ask me to take her to meet them but she wo n't go because she 's embarrassed			0
' she is a person that is very different and i know i can make her happy			0
' our relationship is special because she understands me and i understand her			0
