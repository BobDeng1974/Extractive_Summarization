we live in an age of oversharing where people offer up all sorts of information online from what they 're having for dinner to the toilet habits of their children			1
but could your @entity10 status be giving more away about yourself than you realise ? researchers from @entity13 studied the statuses of 75,000 people and were able to predict their age , gender and even personality type based just on the words they used			1
they also discovered that the sexes live up to stereotypes - with women posting regularly about their hair , boyfriends , chocolate , and babies , while for men it was all about computer games , beards , swearing and sport			1
this cloud shows the most commonly used words by females on @entity10			1
women were more likely to use adjectives , such as ' yummy ' and ' wonderful ' , as well as more emoticons than men			1
they also regularly talked about their family and friends , clothes and hair the most commonly used words by women including ' shopping ' , ' excited ' , ' love you ' and the ' < 3 ' emoticon , which is used a heart			1
men commonly used the word ' f * * k ' , ' f * * * * g ' , ' wishes he ' , ' xbox ' and ' himself ' and we more likely to link to content			1
teenagers used emoticons , variations of the word ' haha ' and discussed school , homework and teachers more than older people			1
they were also more likely to use abbreviations such as ' omfg ' and ' gah '			0
at the older end of the scale - 30 and over - people talked more about napping , showering and wine as well work , wedding and laundry			0
a word cloud that shows language used mostly by extroverts prominently featured words and phrases including ' party , ' ' great night ' and ' hit me up			1
alternatively , a word cloud for introverts featured references to @entity84 media , such as @entity85 and anime , ' sigh ' and more emoticons			0
to visualise the results , researchers created word clouds summarising the language that predicted a certain trait , age or sex , with the size of the word relating directly to how often it was used			1
for example , the most commonly used words by women included ' shopping ' , ' excited ' , ' love you ' and the ' < 3 ' emoticon , which is used a heart			1
while men commonly used the word ' f * * k ' , ' f * * * * g ' , ' wishes he ' , ' xbox ' and ' himself ' , and were more likely to link to content			2
a word cloud that shows language used mostly by extroverts prominently featured words and phrases including ' party , ' ' great night ' and ' hit me up			2
alternatively , a word cloud for introverts featured many references to @entity84 media , such as @entity85 and anime , ' sigh ' and more emoticons			0
co-author @entity121 said : ' it may seem obvious that a super extroverted person would talk a lot about parties , but taken all together , these word clouds provide an unprecedented window into the psychological world of people with a given trait			2
' many things seem obvious after the fact and each item makes sense , but would you have thought of them all , or even most of them ? ' teenagers used emoticons , variations of the word ' haha ' and discussed school , homework and teachers more than older people			2
they were also more likely to use abbreviations such as ' omfg ' and ' gah ' , and discuss kissing , hugging and relationships at the older end of the scale - 30 and over - people talked more about napping , showering and wine as well work , wedding and laundry , pictured @entity10 has added a feature that lets people edit their posts after they have been published			0
the tool was previously only available on comments on posts			0
this means if someone types a mistake and wants to correct it they no longer have to leave it , or delete and re-post			2
to edit a status , click the arrow in the top right - hand corner of the post and click @entity171			0
type the changes and click send again			0
any posts that are changed will be tagged with ' edited '			0
the tool is being rolled out to the web version of the social network site , but is expected to also be made available on @entity179 and @entity180 apps in the near future			0
neurotics were more likely to use words such as ' scared ' , ' depressed ' ' crap ' and ' lonely ' , while people with less neuroticism used words including ' praise ' , ' blessed ' ' beautiful ' , ' success ' and spoke less about sports			2
' this does n't guarantee that doing sports will make you less neurotic ; it could be that neuroticism causes people to avoid sports , ' said co-author professor @entity195 of @entity196			2
' but it does suggest that we should explore the possibility that neurotic individuals would become more emotionally stable if they played more sports			2
' open people spoke more about dreams , art , writing and the universe , whereas people who were less open on the personality questionnaire used more abbreviations and were poor spellers			0
the group from the @entity212 were interested in whether analysis of the language used on @entity10 could provide as much , or more , insight into someone 's personality compared to traditional methods used by psychologists , such as self - reported surveys and questionnaires			2
a word cloud that shows language used mostly by extroverts prominently featured words and phrases including ' party , ' ' great night ' and ' hit me up ' , pictured they asked 75,000 people to complete a common personality questionnaire through a @entity10 app. the participants also made their @entity10 status updates public for a limited time			1
from a database of more than 700 million words , phrases and topics , the researchers looked for overall linguistic patterns used by the volunteers			1
they thencreated a computer algorithm that could predict the person 's age and gender , as well their responses on the personality questionnaires			1
the researchers were correct 92 per cent of the time when predicting users ' gender based only on the language of their status updates , and they could identify a person 's age within three years in more than 50 per cent of cases			1
the personality predictions were ' inherently less accurate ' but author h. @entity259 , a postdoctoral fellow in computer and information science and the @entity262 , claimed that they were ' nearly as good as using a person 's questionnaire results from one day to predict their answers to the same questionnaire on another day			1
' a word cloud for introverts featured many references to @entity84 media , such as @entity85 and anime , ' google ' , ' sigh ' and more emoticons than extroverts ' most words occur rarely - any sample of writing , including @entity10 status updates , only contains a small portion of the average vocabulary , ' @entity259 said			0
' this means that , for all but the most common words , you need writing samples from many people in order to make connections with psychological traits			0
' traditional studies have found interesting connections with pre-chosen categories of words such as ' positive emotion ' or ' function words			0
' however , the billions of word instances available in social media allow us to find patterns at a much richer level			0
' the study is part of the @entity302 with members of the @entity304 in @entity212 's @entity305 and the @entity306 and its @entity262 in the @entity307			0
it was published in the @entity309 .			0

researchers were correct 92 per cent of the time when predicting gender
in more than half of cases they predicted someone 's age within three years
women used more adjectives , while men used more swear words
ages could be identified based on the topics and subjects discussed
@entity330 can also determine whether a person is extrovert or neurotic
@entity13 analysed over 700 million words and topics
