by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 was flying back from @entity3 to his home in @entity5 last year when he could n’t help but reflect that his life had turned a sweet full circle			1
safely tucked away was the $ 11.4million ( £ 7m ) he had just claimed for winning the @entity8 and the @entity9			1
some 35,000ft below was the prison believed to be housing the notorious fraudster @entity11 , the man who swindled @entity2 out of a similar sum in 2009			1
‘ life has a funny way of setting things right , ’ said the personable @entity13			1
‘ i was more than $ 11 million richer and here we were , flying over the federal prison in @entity19 where he is very possibly serving his sentence			1
there was some satisfaction in that , although i could n’t help but think of the people who lost a tremendous amount of money who were n’t fortunate enough to earn it back			1
’ @entity30 : after victories in the @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity2 earned £ 7m it has taken @entity2 a long time to speak openly about that bleak period but he has come to terms with it now			1
‘ it ’s safe to say i wo n’t be visiting him in prison , ’ he said			2
‘ what i might do to him if i saw him face to face might get me arrested as well			2
i lost millions in a ponzi scheme and , while i did n’t have all my eggs in his basket , it hurt			1
’ was it a coincidence that @entity2 fell off the charts in the years that followed ? some of those close to him , like his @entity55 coach @entity54 , understandably believe there to be a link but @entity2 himself wo n’t use it as an excuse			1
‘ it affected me but i got over it emotionally faster than people think , ’ he told @entity61 magazine @entity60			2
‘ i knew investing carries risk and as a professional golfer i ’m used to taking risks			2
a pro golf career is basically a gamble , at least starting out			2
‘ of course i assumed there was only normal risk , when in truth i was destined to lose the whole investment			2
but it all fell under the category of risk , so i tried to accept it and move on			2
’ loss : in 2009 , @entity2 lost a vast sum of money to fraudster @entity11 , who is now in jail he has now done so to such an extent that he enjoyed something of a @entity80 - style summer last year , flattening everyone to top the money lists on both sides of the @entity84 and help himself to the tidy sum of on - course earnings of $ 21m			1
he was also the first player to tie up his place in @entity90 ’s @entity89 team — fully eight months before the end of automatic qualifying			0
in three weeks , he will play in his third @entity89 but first for six years			0
‘ it has been strange knowing for so long i had made it , but now the team has been finalised it is time to put the @entity89 game face on , ’ he said			0
‘ i suppose it was inevitable there would be a reaction this year after what happened last summer , but i have n’t played badly			0
i ’m still in the world ’s top three and feel like my best golf is not far away , so i ’m really looking forward to it			0
’ sympathy : @entity2 said he is happy with his success , but feels for those unable to replace their lost wealth @entity2 might be the only player in world golf who has managed to fight back from not one horrendous slump but two			1
the first came in 2001 , when his driving was so bad he would regularly miss fairways by 70 yards			0
both times he fell outside the world ’s top 200 and both times he bounced back into the top five			0
the fearless 38 - year - old will undoubtedly be one of captain @entity124 ’s key men , both on the course with his ferocious hitting and keeping everyone relaxed off it with his dry sense of humour and penchant for practical jokes			0
you could easily see him playing the role of patriarch to a rookie like @entity138 or equally , forming a formidable all - @entity140 partnership with @entity141			0
first things first , though , and @entity2 is in need of a top - four finish here at the @entity145 to make the top 30 who will contest his two titles , the @entity8 and the @entity150 finale , in @entity3 next week			1
he made a good start , completing a first round 68 yesterday , as one of nine players who were unable to finish on thursday			0
playing partner @entity155 could only manage a 73			0
joint leaders after first round 67s were @entity80 , @entity158 and @entity159			0
as for the other @entity162 , @entity160 and @entity161 shot 68s while @entity164 shot 69 .			0

@entity2 won @entity8 and @entity9
victories earned him £ *7million*
@entity2 lost similar amount to fraudster @entity11 in 2009
