the moment that @entity1 decided that @entity3 lower league football was perhaps not for him came when he was told to train on his own for two weeks for wearing a hat			1
a former @entity3 youth midfielder - born and raised in the shadow of @entity7 was on loan from @entity9 at @entity10 in 2011 when he reached what he views now as a fork in the road of his career			1
' i had captained all the youth teams at @entity9 and had been told i was one for the first team in the future , ' @entity1 reflected in his broad @entity21 accent			1
they were just lumping it up to the strikers and that was n't my style so i was on the bench			2
' i turned up for a game one saturday and was wearing a woolly hat - it was cold - and that was it			2
' i was hammered by the manager and spent the next two weeks training on my own			0
i decided then that i had to do something else			2
' for @entity1 - who had been at @entity9 since he was eight - the choices were stark			1
a change of ownership at his boyhood club had eventually led to a change of manager and words of encouragement from @entity61 were not followed up by his successor @entity62			0
in the summer of 2012 - at the age of just 20 - @entity1 left @entity21 to join @entity23 in @entity65 's @entity64 ' it was obvious that when @entity9 got all the money things would change and they did , ' he reflected			1
' i used to train with the first team at that time and i saw a future there if i proved myself good enough			0
' i had been given a pro contract by @entity72 and i saw other young @entity3 players like @entity74 and @entity75 breaking through a few years ahead of me			1
' all i wanted to do was play for them and i really thought i would one day			0
@entity1 in action for the @entity64 side against @entity80 in may 2014 @entity1 watches on as @entity82 star @entity81 goes on the attack during a pre-season in july 2013 ' but after the club changed hands doors began to close for people like me			1
i saw the big foreign players like @entity89 being bought at the top level and i knew it was over			0
' i could have gone in to the lower leagues but the @entity10 experience scarred me			1
' at clubs at that level the coaches talk about nice tactics and systems in pre-season but as soon as they lose a few games they panic and just start whacking it up the pitch			0
' in @entity3 , you get thrown in like that and it can ruin you if you are a smaller , skilful player			1
' i have seen too many good young , technical players get lost in the @entity3 league system			1
they go down the leagues and never come back			0
' it was depressing and i did n't want that to happen to me			2
when i got the chance to move to @entity65 i took it with both hands			1
' it was scary as i was so young			0
but i thought it may save my career and it did			0
' two - and - a - half seasons on , @entity1 is a @entity120 international and vice-captain of his @entity65 club			1
a regular in his @entity23 's midfield , he returned to @entity21 for his winter break recently to reflect on his time at a club that has now been hit by financial troubles			2
@entity129 - a former @entity9 youth graduate like @entity1 - has performed admirably for newly - promoted @entity130 the day we met , in a cafe in the suburb of @entity134 , @entity1 was due to fly back to @entity65 to resume his season			1
that morning he had been paid for the first time in three months and he has decided to leave when his contract expires at the end of the season			1
there is an offer from @entity142 - ironically coached by @entity62 - but @entity1 knows the intention would be to loan him out			1
' i have learned so much in @entity65 and have become a much better player , ' he recalled			2
' i would come back to @entity3 to play now if i got the right club			2
it 's my home , after all			0
but i have an open mind as to where i go next			0
' it was a real eye opener when i went there two and half years ago			0
i did n't speak @entity65 and had to learn quickly			1
and the training there is so different from @entity3			2
' it 's all tactics and eleven v eleven games			0
@entity156 ( right ) - pictured vying for the ball with @entity158 ( left ) - has also impressed for @entity130 ' i have become a tactical robot			2
i know every system on the planet now ! ' the @entity65 players ca n't believe the days off the @entity3 get			1
they do n't want time off			0
' i arrived as a nobody and i am a senior player now			0
i would never have believed that			0
' i have a wife and two children and i am proud of all that			0
' @entity1 is not bitter that he did n't make it at @entity9			1
other @entity9 graduates of similar age - such as @entity130 duo @entity129 and @entity156 - have gone on to play in the @entity173 and that only serves to encourage him			1
he is rightly proud of the rather different road he has travelled and laughs when told about the new facilities his old club have at their new Â£ 200million academy			0
' it was n't quite like that at the old @entity181 but i loved it there , ' he said			0
' i would n't change it			0

@entity1 is currently on the books of @entity186 side @entity23
the *22* - year - old failed to make the grade at @entity9
after a loan spell at @entity10 , he decided life in @entity3 was n't for him
the *playmaker* has impressed in @entity65 since making the move
the youngster is out of contract at the end of the current season
@entity1 has an offer on the table from @entity64 *giants* @entity142
