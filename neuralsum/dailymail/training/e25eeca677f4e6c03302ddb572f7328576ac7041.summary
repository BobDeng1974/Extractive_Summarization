' up in the northern tip of @entity23 at @entity68 , you can see a smooth line of all these people tweeting and i think this is where people on boats get into range of @entity1 and can start tweeting			2
' mr @entity9 said airports and traffic lights were other interesting hotspots			2
' even though you 're meant to turn off your phones , there are quite a few people who are still tweeting on the runway and you can see them tweeting things like " i ’m on my way to @entity85 " or farewells and stuff , ' he said			0
' there are also hotspots at particular junctions with traffic lights , where i assume people are tweeting and sharing their locations , and it ’s interesting to see that is what ’s happening when you should n't be on the phone			1
