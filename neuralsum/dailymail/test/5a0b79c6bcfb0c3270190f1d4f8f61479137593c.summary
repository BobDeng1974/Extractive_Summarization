@entity13 , @entity12 director of rugby , has ruled the 29 - year - old out of saturday 's @entity16 match against @entity17 and he is not expected to face @entity18 the following week			1

' he 's frustrated because he wants to help his team - mates			2
what 's even more frustrating is he ca n't contribute in meetings			0
he ca n't even be in the room to help people because we 're sending him home to get himself right			0
i want to see @entity0 right when he is in his 50s , not when he is in his prime			2
' @entity0 was knocked cold in an accidental collision during @entity1 's 47 - 17 victory over @entity7 at @entity39 in february and forced to leave the field			1
he missed the next game against @entity42 but played against @entity43 and in the championship decider against @entity45 after which he admitted he ' did n't feel quite right '			2
assuming @entity12 do not reach the @entity50 play - offs , @entity0 's last chance to feature before the end of the season will be in the final - round fixture against @entity52			1
' you ca n't rule out the possibility that he might not play again this season , ' said @entity13			1
' do i think he 'll be right for @entity18 ? i do n't think so			0
do i think we 're looking at @entity52 ? yes , but if he 's not right then , he 's not right			0
' feb 14 : knocked out in 13th minute of @entity1 's @entity6 fixture against @entity7 following huge collision with @entity22			1

@entity0 , who is not even allowed to train on an indoor bike until he is symptom free , is @entity1 head coach @entity77 's first - choice full back going into the @entity5 and @entity13 backs the player to regain his form quickly			1
@entity1 play a double - header against @entity45 in august , before facing @entity42 in their third and final warm - up fixture in september			1
' he 'll have the @entity5 warm - ups and he 'll be fine , ' said @entity13			2
' @entity83 is not an issue at all			0
mentally , @entity0 is unflappable and will just get on with it			2
with your @entity1 hat on , you might say this enforced break is the best thing for his limbs			0
what he 's been told to do is take complete and utter rest			0
we normally have to pull him away from extra training but he 'll look back on this window and learn from it			0
' he will not undergo a normal return to play procedure now — it will be a more extensive procedure			0
it 's not about @entity12 ; it 's about @entity0			1
as a club , we 've looked after the player and did n't have a second thought about standing him down the monday he came in			0
this is n't like the old days — it 's not a badge of honour to play on any more			0
' @entity12 director of rugby @entity13 says that he does not blame the @entity1 for @entity0 's injury having played only six of @entity12 ' last 19 fixtures , brown will gain valuable game time in the @entity1 preparation games			1
it raises the question as to whether he was rushed back too early , although @entity13 does not lay any blame at @entity1 's door			1
' i 'm not remotely frustrated at them , ' said @entity13			0
' @entity0 was honest enough to pull himself out from the @entity122 game and everyone has a duty of care towards the player			2
' even a slight intimation that anyone does not look after the player 's best interests is just wrong			0
' @entity0 breaks clear to score the opening try for @entity12 against @entity18 at @entity39 last year			1
