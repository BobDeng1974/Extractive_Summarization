the @entity2 administration 's ' @entity0 ' provides easy example calculations for middle - class earners , but nothing representing what the wealthy pay in taxes			1
shown is the calculation for a married taxpayer who earns $ 80,000 the administration rolled out a ' tax receipt ' web page on monday so people can see where their taxes are going in state spending , coinciding with the deadline day for @entity19 to file their annual returns			2
but while the @entity22 made it easy to see how much -- or how little -- lower - income and middle - class earners pay to @entity26 , it made it difficult for ordinary taxpayers to learn how much the wealthy pay toward federal spending			1
the online receipt was set up to itemized what @entity19 ' income , @entity32 and @entity33 taxes actually pay for , broken down along a long list of categories			0
it also provides a handful of example calculations			0
the @entity22 's typical $ 80,000 earner who is married and filing jointly , for instance , pays $ 4,590 in federal income tax			2
of that , more than $ 1,130 is devoted to national defense , another $ 1,030 for health care - related costs , and $ 792 to a category that includes food stamps , housing assistance and unemployment insurance			2
the calculator makes it easy to see numbers associated with its $ 80,000 example , along with four others ranging in income down to $ 25,000			0
but no examples are provided for upper - income earners , despite the president 's frequent argument for a ' @entity67 ' tax that would ensure @entity19 who make $ 1 million or more would pay at least 30 percent of their income to the federal government			1
while taxpayers who make more than $ 80,000 per year can consult their own tax returns for the numbers required to operate the calculator , lower - income earners would need to know how to use several online tools in order to estimate those numbers for someone who earns dramatically more than they do			1
the @entity78 in @entity79 showed a debt of about $ 14.4 trillion in july 2011			0
that number was more than $ 16.2 trillion as @entity82 2013 arrived and @entity19 focused on how much they are paying each year for government spending president @entity2 took credit in january for tax legislation that averted much of the damage from the so - called ' fiscal cliff , ' but the national debt continues to climb and @entity89 argue that the coming higher tax rates will stifle economic growth it took @entity93 35 minutes to calculate the taxes paid by a hypothetical $ 240,000 salaried earner who is married and filing taxes jointly with a spouse , using the same conditions as in the @entity22 's example for an $ 80,000 earner			1
that $ 240,000 salaried employee , would contribute toward every federal program more than 10 times what the $ 80,000 employee chips in , despite earning just three times as much money			0
under the same assumptions as the @entity22 used , his or her $ 48,287 in federal income taxes would include $ 11,897 for national defense , $ 10,840 spent on health care - related costs , and $ 8,334 for the broad ' @entity116 ' spending category			1
the @entity22 website does n't provide a way to easily determine the tax burden for a given income level , which can depend on several factors including charitable giving , dependent children , tax - deferred savings , and unreimbursed job expenses			1
' you deserve to know how your tax dollars are being spent , ' wrote @entity22 director of digital content @entity128			0
but @entity19 do n't seem to deserve to know how the government spends other taxpayers ' contributions @entity133 spokesman @entity132 criticized the administration for treating entitlement programs as though they consumed less of @entity19 ' overall tax obligations than defense spending all the calculations provided by the @entity22 describe national defense as the largest federal government spending program , although @entity32 and @entity33 entitlement spending is , collectively , larger			1
those entitlement programs are administered through payroll taxes , which the @entity22 calculator treats as separate from other tax dollars			2
the @entity2 administration is attempting to ' cut data from the spending side , likely to avoid showing how much @entity32 and @entity33 take out of the budget , ' @entity133 spokesman @entity132 told @entity93 , ' with the added bonus of [ @entity151 of ] defense spending appearing to be government 's biggest expense			2
' workers and business owners who are paying @entity32 and @entity33 taxes right out of their paychecks are likely not interested in separating them into a special category and pretending they never happened , ' @entity132 added			0
@entity22 principal deputy press secretary @entity162 ( @entity163 ) would n't talk about why the administration made it so challenging for @entity19 to learn how much wealthy taxpayers contribute toward federal spending programs @entity93 's $ 240,000 earning example presumed , as the @entity22 's did , that the taxpayer set aside 5 per cent of income in a 401 ( k ) or other qualifying retirement program and did not itemize deductions			1
@entity19 collecting that much in salary do not qualify for the child tax credit applied to the examples on the @entity22 website			2
@entity2 spokesmen @entity178 and @entity179 both declined to respond on the record to questions about why the administration made it a challenge for citizens to learn how much the rich are paying in taxes			0
they also would n't comment on whether the calculator , now in its third year in one form or another , was only intended to help taxpayers generate information on the destinations of their own tax dollars			1
but in an accompanying blog post			0
@entity22 director of digital content @entity128 indicated that the administration did n't mean for ordinary @entity19 to learn about how the federal government spends the money it collects from taxpayers whom the president has excoriated for failing to ' pay their fair share			1
' write caption here ' you deserve to know how your tax dollars are being spent , ' @entity201 wrote			0
she made no mention of learning how much taxes are collected from earners in other tax brackets , or how that money is applied to federal spending			0
' as long as he â€™s in office , ' she added , referring to president @entity2 , ' every hardworking taxpayer will be able to jump online to see exactly how their tax dollars are being spent			0

examples provided for $ *25k* - $ *80k* earners , but not for wealthy taxpayers
@entity22 wo n't comment on failure to show *massive* tax burden of the ' one percent '
*watchdog* says administration is *hiding* entitlement spending to make the defense budget look bigger
