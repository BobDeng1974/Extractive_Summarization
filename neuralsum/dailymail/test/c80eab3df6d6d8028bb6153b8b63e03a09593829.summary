the familiar brown signs are set up to show tourists where to find an area ’s finest attractions			2
so visitors to @entity7 ’s golf course or the @entity10 town ’s historic cathedral were surprised instead to be pointed in the direction of some toilets , the local gp ... and an abattoir			1
and even if bewildered tourists did suddenly fancy a trip to the slaughterhouse , they would discover it is in the process of being demolished			1
on a visit to the @entity22 town of @entity7 , tourists are pointed towards the local slaughterhouse visitors to @entity7 , pictured , have to move quickly if they wish to visit the abattoir - as its being demolished the bizarre sign caused an online stir after it was posted on @entity29 and retweeted by @entity22 crime writer @entity30			1
the photo was originally put online by @entity32 from @entity33 , @entity34 , who tweeted : ‘ market day tomorrow in the town that has all bases covered when it comes to tourist attractions			2
’ the tweet then quickly drew a series of facetious online comments			0
@entity44 asked : ‘ @entity45 lives anywhere nearby ? ’ @entity47 said : ‘ a trip to @entity7 ? it ’s kill or cure ... ’ @entity50 of @entity52 ’s @entity51 , based in the nearby retail park in @entity7 , said yesterday of the abattoir : ‘ it has been knocked to the ground			1
they are demolishing it as we speak			0
it ’s been derelict for four or five years			0
’ @entity61 signs normally only point to attractions or sites of historic significance			0
a @entity67 spokesman said : ‘ we are looking into the current status and accuracy of the sign in question			0

@entity7 in @entity22 is pointing tourists towards the local abattoir
the attraction is listed *beneath* the toilet , *doctor* and the town *'s* *museum*
visitors *hoping* to experience the slaughterhouse face *disappointment*
the abattoir has been *closed* for several years and is being demolished
