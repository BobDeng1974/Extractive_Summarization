education secretary @entity0 today became the most senior @entity2 politician yet to complain about a newspaper sting targeting mps online			1
it follows allegations of ' entrapment ' against a newspaper that forced @entity9 to resign as a minister for sending an explicit photograph of himself to an undercover reporter posing as a @entity2 activist			1
as another mp said the story could be a test case for the new press regulator , the @entity15 , mrs @entity14 said the @entity20 ' will have to think about their conduct '			1
education secretary @entity0 today suggested the @entity20 had questions to answer about its sting involving charities minister @entity9 , who resigned after sending an explicit photograph of himself to an undercover journalist posing as a @entity2 activist charities minister mr @entity9 was forced to quit after allegedly sending a picture of himself wearing @entity31 pyjamas to a journalist , masquerading as ' @entity33 ' , via the instant messaging app @entity34			1
mr @entity9 admitted : ' i have been a complete fool			0
' however , lawyers and media commentators questioned whether there was a public interest in using subterfuge to get the @entity2 mp to exchange explicit images with an undercover reporter , who was working for the @entity20			1
some even suggested that the paper may have committed a criminal offence by ' tricking ' mr @entity9 into sexual activity			0
a male journalist working for the @entity20 set up a fake @entity49 account in the name of @entity33 , supposedly a pretty blonde in her 20s working in @entity52 ' @entity33 ' described herself as a ' twenty - something @entity2 pr girl ' in @entity55 , and her flirty and flattering tweets attracted the attention of several @entity2 mps – including married minister mr @entity9			1
mrs @entity14 , who is also the women 's minister , said today : ' it is not right that photos are taken without consent from anybody			1
' there is also the broader issue of this story and the fact there was a paper that seemed to be out to target a particular group of men			0
' they will have to answer , i 'm afraid , and i think there are regulations affecting that , ' she said at a @entity2 party conference fringe event reported by @entity78			1
' in relation to my own colleague @entity9 , he was right to resign and he did that quickly … i think people realise this is one person who has made a big mistake and has paid for it massively … people appreciate that we are all flawed human beings			0
the paper will have to think about their conduct			2
' enticing : the @entity49 profile picture of ' @entity33 ' , who is really a @entity93 model uninvolved in the sting			1
@entity95 , 22 , last night said it was ' offensive ' to use her image without permission alluring : this picture of ' miss @entity101 's ' legs - actually miss @entity102 's - was used as the journalist encouraged mr @entity9 to send explicit images			1
miss @entity102 said the mp had nothing to be ashamed of and should not resign another @entity2 mp , @entity105 , plans to make a formal complaint over allegations of ' entrapment ' against a newspaper that forced @entity9 to resign as a minister for sending an explicit photograph of himself			1
he said on @entity49 he would be referring the story to the @entity15 ( @entity114 ) , which recently replaced the @entity15			2
he told his 3,200 @entity49 followers : ' test case for @entity15 will be making formal complaint over attempted entrapment by @entity20			1
' speaking to the @entity119 , he said : ' it is in the public interest that their actions are fully investigated			1
this is the first real test as to whether the new body , @entity114 , has any teeth			0
' conservative mp @entity127 ( @entity128 ) , who chairs the parliamentary committee that examines press regulation , said the case raised serious questions about whether or not the journalist 's method was a legitimate use of subterfuge			2
he said on first glance he was not convinced it was justified and welcomed the investigation by @entity114			2
anger : a photo by ' @entity33 ' was in fact of unsuspecting @entity102 , from @entity142 he told @entity144 's @entity146 programme : ' there are strict rules about this ... and on the first sight i 'm not convinced that actually this was justified			1
' i 'm glad it has been referred to @entity114			2
that will provide the chance for the newspaper to provide justification for the use of these tactics but they will need to have to demonstrate it was n't a fishing exercise which it looks very much as if it was			0
' they will need to demonstrate there was public interest involved			1
i 'm not convinced that was the case either			2
' we shall be watching very carefully as this is a test of @entity114			0
' former culture secretary @entity171 , who has been campaigning around the issue of revenge pornography , said the situation ' graphically demonstrates ' why people have to be very cautious about the sorts of images they take of themselves and the way they communicate those around the internet			0
she added : ' i think it is very sad			0
i think @entity9 has contributed enormously to the role of women within my party ... i think he is a great politician			2
' the @entity20 said the story was in the public interest			1
@entity187 , @entity20 weekend editor , told the @entity78 : ' this investigation was brought to the @entity20 by a freelance reporter			1
' the investigation , which had a clear public interest , was carried out following information from a reliable source			1
' @entity15 's code of practice states editors must justify intrusions into people 's private lives , including when using digital communications			1
it adds : ' engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge , including by agents or intermediaries , can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material can not be obtained by other means			1
' @entity209 , media lawyer at @entity210 , said : ' i think many members of the public reading the @entity20 story will consider that it does amount to entrapment – particularly if you look at when the story has been used			1
' and criminal barrister @entity220 wrote on his blog yesterday : ' what conceivable public interest was served by tricking mr @entity9 in this way ? ' @entity225 , editor - in - chief of the @entity226 and @entity20 , defended the story after former @entity119 journalist @entity228 claimed it was ' unethical '			1
he tweeted : ' 1 ) it was n't a @entity20 sting 2 ) there 's a nailed - on public interest			1
' the pictures of ' @entity33 ' on the account appear to have simply been taken from the internet			1
they show at least two different women – one an unsuspecting young woman from @entity142 and the other a blonde model from @entity93 , who yesterday made furious claims she had been ' exploited '			2
although the name @entity33 was selected for the account , it bears no connection to any real person with that name			2
however , the bogus profile was still enough to persuade the married @entity2 minister he was chatting to a young woman – a conversation which culminated in him sending an x-rated photo			1
the journalist also tried to charm a series of conservative politicians as ' @entity257 ' – and a number replied			2
' she ' described newly - elected @entity260 mp @entity259 , 32 , as a ' fitty ' , and called housing minister @entity262 , 43 , a ' legend '			2
the reporter also tried to flirt with @entity2 mp @entity264 , 43 , after he posted a picture of himself with two dogs at a pet shop in his @entity269 constituency – although the mp simply acknowledged it with a polite reply			1
other @entity2 politicians lauded by ' @entity257 ' included @entity274 , 40 , @entity105 , 47 , and @entity275 , 55			2
the journalist also used the account to tweet about boozy work nights out , sunbathing and sport as well as conservative policies			0
there is no suggestion that any mp apart from mr @entity9 behaved inappropriately or sent any explicit material			0
the fake @entity49 profile was set up in may and has now been deleted			2
its profile photograph was yesterday revealed to be @entity93 model @entity95 , 22 , who last night said it was ' offensive ' to use her image without permission			0
'' i have had a lot of emails , texts and phonecalls from different countries about it			0
it feels unreal , ' she tells @entity299			0
disgraced : @entity9 with his wife @entity300 , just after he was elected mp for @entity301 in 2005 ' i do not want to be used this way and that someone has used my picture this way feels so horrible , both for me and others involved in this			0
' on her blog she writes : ' i feel very confused right now and still ca n't comprehend that what has happened has happened			0
i can blog more about this another day , but right now i ca n't bare to talk about it			0
' ' this thing feels really unpleasant			0
' the undercover reporter also used another enticing picture from a young @entity318 woman 's @entity49 page as part of the deception			2
during the summer heatwave , ' @entity257 ' tweeted ' cheeky early finish on a friday # lappingupthesun '			0
it was illustrated with a selfie of a woman 's tanned legs , which was taken from a tweet sent the previous day by @entity102 , 26 , from @entity328 , @entity142			0
miss @entity102 told the @entity329 she was upset that the @entity20 had hijacked her photo for use in its sting			1
she said mr @entity9 had nothing to be ashamed of and should have felt no need to resign			0
' i think grown adults can do whatever they like as long as both of them are over the age of consent , ' she said , adding that she hoped mr @entity9 was okay and revealing she felt ' awful ' about her unwitting role in his downfall			0
' the fact that a newspaper was stealing my photograph is quite wrong			0
the newspaper 's taken it too far , ' she said of the @entity20 reporter 's use of her photograph			1
the main focus of the journalist 's investigation appears to have been mr @entity9 , 56			0
' @entity257 ' retweeted several of his postings , which covered everything from a concert by the @entity357 to a briefing by charities about their work in @entity361			0
she wrote ' haha ! ' when the mp complained about people phoning him during the @entity365 men 's final in july			0
when mr @entity9 posted a picture of himself with a dog called ' @entity368 ' at a fete in his @entity301 constituency , she commented : ' aww ! ' only one of mr @entity9 's replies to ' @entity257 ' survives			0
on june 15 he simply wrote : ' delighted ! '			0
