by @entity0 the queen 's cousin is calling for new laws forcing supermarkets to sell only food after blaming the closure of his 174 - year - old hardware store on the opening of an @entity10			1
the @entity11 - whose family seat is @entity14 , the birthplace of the @entity16 - said he was ' deeply saddened ' that his ironmongery shop was to shut later this month			1
he said @entity25 council bears ' much of the blame ' for the closure for allowing the construction of an @entity10 supermarket nearby , along with other discount retailers in the town			1
the @entity26 bought the shop @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity25 , in 2005 from @entity30 and @entity31 , whose great - grandfather , @entity32 , established the business in 1840			2
' killed off by @entity10 ' : @entity11 holds a fork handle and four candles ( a reference to the @entity38 sketch ) outside his ironmongers shop in @entity29 which is closing down due to competition from supermarkets the @entity26 's third wife , @entity43 , whom he married in 2012 , was the manager of the store			1
in a statement , he said : ' an array of factors have built up against us in the past eight years			0
' firstly , the inextricable rise of the internet , which i can only see going one way and that is ever upwards			0
' secondly , over the past 18 months , we have had severe staffing issues within the shop			2
' thirdly , i ’m afraid much of the blame must be laid at the council ’s doorstep , with the arrival of @entity10 and three large discount stores within the small town of @entity29			1
' with the cost of renovations carried out due to fire regulations and increasing overheads , plus all the above factors taken into consideration , it is quite impossible to continue trading			0
' he later told the @entity71 : ' every supermarket that arrives selling all sorts of things is bound to make an impact on local independents			1
' in my humble view , supermarkets should be for selling food and nothing else			1
they are just killing off the centre of these old towns			2

the @entity11 said @entity25 council bears ' much of the blame ' for the closure for allowing an @entity10 supermarket to be built nearby after buying the business , the @entity26 said he wanted to keep the distinct charm of ironmongery , characterised famously in ' @entity96 ' comedy sketch by the two ronnies			1
now he is saddened that the store ’s remarkable run must come to an end			1
he added : ' i realise that @entity29 will lose one of its iconic retail shops and my wife and i are deeply saddened having come to this decision			1
' the @entity26 , who is one of @entity107 ’s richest landowners , married the current @entity11 after acquiring @entity108 , where she worked			1
the couple married in a low - key ceremony at his historic £ 12million seat - the childhood home of the late queen mother - watched by close family and friends			2
the shop , which has a provisional closing date of june 27 , sells a wide range of goods , from hardware and household electrical items to tableware and decorative items			2
it passed on through five generations of the @entity31 family before it was sold to the @entity11			1
@entity126 formed a partnership with his cousin to open the ironmongers business in 1840 , but the partnership dissolved after 10 years and the shop was carried on by @entity32 until his death in 1872			2
his son , @entity133 continued the business before passing it on to his sons @entity136 and @entity138 critical : the @entity26 said the arrival of supermarkets like @entity10 ( @entity29 store not pictured ) ' is bound to make an impact on local independents ' upon the death of @entity146 , the business passed to his son @entity136 and then to his sons @entity149 and @entity30			1
the store still has a water - operated lift , installed in 1908 , which is still in working order today			0
@entity29 councillor @entity152 said he was ' shocked ' to hear the news of the historic retailer ’s @entity154 said : ' i ’ve used the shop for probably 50 years			0
' @entity158 always had whatever you needed and i know farmers in the area used to rely on it heavily			0
' it ’s a real shame it ’s closing			0
' @entity166 , a committee member of the @entity168 branch of business group @entity169 , said : ' it is a real shame that when a company with so much history ceases to trade			0
' shops like @entity31 provide goods you ca n’t get form the big companies			0
the problem is , with the growth of the internet , people who want to shop online will do it			0
' small shops have to find some way of adapting to the internet , or offering a personal service that people ca n’t get online			0
