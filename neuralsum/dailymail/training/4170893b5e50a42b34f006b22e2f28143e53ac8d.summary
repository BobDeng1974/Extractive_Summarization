a top secret @entity2 base in @entity3 where lethal drones strikes have been launched from has been exposed on internet search giant @entity5 , it was claimed today			1
a blogger has spotted an unmarked facility that has runways , hangars and what appear to be living quarters and offices buried deep in the desert			1
it follows claims by the @entity17 that it had revealed the @entity2 uses a base in @entity3 to target @entity20 operatives in neighbouring @entity21			1
scroll down to explore @entity5 map the site believed to be a secret @entity3 drone base that was spotted on the @entity5 search engine the unmarked facility that has runways , hangars and what appear to be living quarters and offices it was from this base that the @entity33 - born operative @entity32 was killed in 2011			1
@entity34 , who runs @entity37 's @entity36 blog , said : ' the base 's hangars bear a remarkable resemblance to similar structures found on other @entity33 drone outposts			1
' and its remote location — dozens of miles from the nearest highway , and farther still to the nearest town – suggests that this may be more than the average civilian airstrip			0
' @entity34 also claimed on @entity37 he has earned tacit confirmation from two former @entity33 intelligence officers that the location is correct			2
' i believe it 's the facility that the @entity33 uses to fly drones into @entity21 , ' one of them told @entity34			1
' it 's out in eastern @entity3 , near @entity21 and where the bad guys are supposed to hang out			2
' it has those clamshell hangars , which we 've seen before associated with @entity33 drones			1
' the drone that killed @entity33 - born operative @entity32 in 2011 was launched from a secret base in @entity3 it is located deep in the desert in @entity3 near the border with @entity21 , which has been the target of @entity33 drone strikes the other officer described the location as ' way , way out in the @entity73 , otherwise known as @entity74 '			1
the facility 's whereabouts had remained secret at the request of high - ranking officials , although it was known that one had been built			2
earlier this week a human rights organisation has claimed that up to 54 countries may have helped the @entity2 to hold terrorism suspects in secret prisons , or turn them over to foreign governments			0
the revelation comes amid a growing outcry against the @entity90 administration 's use of deadly drones and their use to watch @entity33 citizens			0
@entity94 is now trying to limit the power the @entity33 has to kill suspected terrorists , including @entity33 citizens , with drones			0
@entity33 citizen @entity32 , who was born in @entity98 , was killed by a drone in @entity21 in 2011			1
it was launched from a secret base in @entity3 in response , the government defended its lethal drone programme by citing the laws that were introduced following the september 11 attacks			1
@entity108 senator @entity107 said in a recent : ' it has to be in the agenda of this @entity94 to reconsider the scope of action of drones and use of deadly force by the @entity33 around the world because the original authorisation of use of force , i think , is being strained to its limits , ' congressman @entity123 , the number two @entity124 in the @entity126 , said : ' it deserves a serious look at how we make the decisions in government to take out , kill , eliminate , whatever word you want to use , not just @entity33 citizens but other citizens as well			0
' @entity123 added : ' we ought to carefully review our policies as a country			0
' @entity108 chairman @entity141 and the panel 's top @entity142 , senator @entity144 , both have both quietly expressed concerns about the deadly operation and the @entity148 is likely to hold hearings on @entity33 drone policy , an aide said on tuesday			2
one of the most successful drone strikes was the one in @entity21 that killed three @entity33 citizens : @entity32 , his 16 - year - old - son and @entity154			1
@entity155 was linked to the planning and execution of several attacks targeting @entity33 and @entity160 interests , including the attempt to down a @entity163 - bound airliner in 2009 and the plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010			2
his son was killed in a separate strike on a suspected @entity20 den. @entity154 was an @entity20 propagandist			2
@entity170 spokesman @entity169 called the strikes ' legal , ethical and wise ' and said they are covered by a law that @entity94 approved allowing the use of military force against @entity20			0
he added : ' it is a matter of fact that @entity20 is in a state of war against us and that senior leaders , operational leaders of @entity20 are continually plotting to attack the @entity33 , plotting to kill @entity33 citizens as they did most horrifically on september 11th of 2001			1
' the @entity33 government can legally order the killing of @entity33 citizens if they have senior - level ties to @entity20 the use of drones has caused tensions in some countries where civilians have died three days after september 11 , @entity94 approved a law authorising the military to use ' all necessary and appropriate force ' against @entity20 and other groups believed to be helping or harbouring the global terror network , including the use of drone strikes			1
because militants have since splintered into a number of affiliates and sympathisers the current laws could allow military force against thousands of people across the @entity203 and @entity204 who have limited or no ability to strike the @entity33			0
both the @entity2 and the @entity33 military are authorised to remotely pilot unmanned , missile - carrying drones against terror suspects			1
it 's unknown exactly how many strikes have been carried out , but experts say that drone attacks in @entity213 are conducted by the @entity2 , while those in @entity21 and @entity215 , for example , are by military forces			2
' the base 's hangars bear a remarkable resemblance to similar structures found on other @entity33 drone outposts			1
' @entity34 the drones have strained diplomacy between the @entity33 and the nations where the strikes are carried out , as civilians have been killed alongside the targeted terrorists , even though most nations have given @entity229 at least tacit agreement to carry out the attacks			2
a @entity203 diplomat said that in @entity21 , for example , an increase of @entity33 drone strikes last month have killed dozens of people and upset the local public , leading some leaders in @entity239 to reconsider how often they should be used			1
the @entity240 is also considering basing surveillance drones in @entity242 to monitor on burgeoning extremist violence in @entity204 , but it 's not clear if they will be armed , it has emerged			0
the campaign against the use of drones to spy on @entity33 citizens has also been growing in momentum			0
@entity251 , in @entity250 , became the first city in the @entity33 to pass a resolution against the use of drones for surveillance against @entity33 citizens			0
it calls on @entity94 and the @entity259 of the @entity250 to bring in laws ' prohibiting information obtained from the domestic use of drones from being introduced into a @entity265 or state court			0
' the resolution also ' pledges to abstain from similar uses with city - owned , leased or borrowed drones			0
' @entity270 , a council member who voted in favour of the bill , told @entity273 that drones are ' pretty clearly a threat to our constitutional right to privacy			0
' she added : ' if we do n't get out ahead of it to establish some guidelines for how drones are used , they will be used in a very invasive way and we 'll be left to try and pick up the pieces			0
' the campaign has been helped by a @entity288 memo that has recently surfaced , which show drones can strike against a wider range of threats than previously believed .			0
