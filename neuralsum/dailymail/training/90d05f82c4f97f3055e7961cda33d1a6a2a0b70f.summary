@entity1 ’s debt mountain has topped £ 1.387trillion , and is now the equivalent of 90 per cent of the entire economy			1
the grim milestone was passed at the end of 2012 , new figures from the @entity5 revealed today			1
it lays bare the dire state of the nation ’s finances in the wake of the 2007 financial crash , which has seen government debt double in just five years			1
gross national debt has risen dramatically since the financial crash in 2007 , new figures from the @entity5 show the shocking figure will be used later this month to compare @entity1 ’s finances to the rest of @entity20			1
the @entity5 said that in december gross debt , which includes all financial liabilities of both central and local government but does not take account of liquid assets , was £ 1,387,436,000,000 , up seven per cent on a year earlier			1
by comparison , the entire @entity1 economy was valued at £ 1,541,465,000,000			1
the dismal state of government borrowing has already forced chancellor @entity30 to abandon his target to see net debt , a different measure , falling as a percentage of the economy by 2015 - 16			2
but he has refused to budge on his austerity programme			0
in last month ’s budget , mr @entity30 told @entity38 his chance of meeting his debt targets had ‘ deteriorated ’			0
he added : ‘ there are those who would want to cut much more than we are planning to – and chase the debt target			0
‘ i said in december that i thought that with the current weak economic conditions across @entity20 that would be a mistake			2
we ’ve got a plan to cut our structural deficit			0
‘ and our country ’s credibility comes from delivering that plan , not altering it with every forecast			0
’ in a boost for @entity30 , today 's figures show how annual government borrowing has fallen markedly since 2009 gross debt had been fairly level in the decade from 1992 , when @entity58 won the general election			1
it rose from £ 238billion in 1992 to £ 402billion 10 years later			0
but under @entity62 debt levels gradually climbed before the financial crash in 2007 led to an explosion in borrowing			2
chancellor @entity30 , pictured yesterday , has been forced to abandon his debt targets as the economy has taken longer than expected to revive in the last five years gross debt has soared from £ 577billion in 2006 to £ 1.387trillion in 2012			1
it means gross debt is equivalent to 90 per cent of the entire @entity1 economy , well above the 60 per cent threshold set by the @entity72			1
the @entity1 gross debt level is up from 85.5 per cent of gdp at the end of 2011 and just 43.3 per cent in 2006			1
@entity76 , @entity62 's shadow treasury minister , said : ' for all @entity81 's false claims to be paying down @entity1 's debts , the national debt has gone up and up on his watch			1
' and far from getting the deficit down , the @entity84 has said it will be the same this year as it was last year and the year before			0
this can no longer be called a deficit reduction plan			0
' this is happening because our economy has flatlined for the last three years and unemployment is high and rising again			0
we should be acting to get the economy moving , not paying for the mounting costs of this government 's total economic failure			0
' under rules agreed in the @entity98 , all @entity20 countries must report every year on their finances to ‘ avoid excessive budgetary deficits ’			2
under the rules countries should run a debt to gdp ratio of 60 per cent			0
in a boost to mr @entity30 , today ’s figures show that government borrowing is falling			0
the gap between government spending and what it raises through taxes peaked at £ 161billion in 2009 , falling to £ 150 billion in 2010 , £ 119billion in 2011 and £ 98billion in 2012			2
it means net borrowing as a percentage of @entity74 stood at just 6.8 per cent at the end of 2012 , its lowest level since 2008 and at similar levels to those seen in the mid- 1990s .			2

gross debt at the end of 2012 stood at £ 1.387trillion , up 7 ***%*** on 2011
vast sum is equivalent to 90 ***%*** of gdp - up from38 ***%*** a decade *ago*
figures used to compare @entity1 to the rest of @entity20
mounting debts reveal the *devastating* impact of the 2007 crash
