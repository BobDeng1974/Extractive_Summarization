the @entity6 mp has said niqabs are ' offensive ' and ' make women invisible ' a @entity6 mp yesterday urged the government to ban full facial veils in all schools and colleges because they were ‘ making women invisible ’			1
dr @entity1 said some women found the niqab ‘ deeply offensive ’ and should not be accused of being bigoted for criticising them			1
she made the comments on @entity18 following a college ’s u-turn last week on banning students wearing veils and before a judge is due to decide today on whether a @entity25 woman can stand trial while wearing one			1
dr @entity1 , the mp for @entity3 in @entity4 , said : ‘ the niqab should be banned within schools and colleges ; how on earth do they promote equality when they collude with making women invisible ? ’ she also wrote : ‘ a general ban on the niqab simply wo n’t happen in the @entity39 but that does n’t mean that it should be endorsed by schools or courts			1
’ her comments were met by a backlash from supporters of the veil , but she stood her ground against the angry criticism			0
the mp said her view was ‘ not bigotry ’ and that this accusation was ‘ the cudgel used to repress debate ’			0
she added : ‘ feminists should be allowed to say that they find the niqab deeply offensive without being accused of being bigoted or islamaphobic			2
’ prime minister @entity55 has indicated his support for the college , but deputy prime minister @entity58 has admitted he is ‘ uneasy ’ about banning full - face veils			1
last week , @entity60 was forced to drop its ban on students wearing full facial veils on its campus after a protest			1
a 9,000 - name petition saw its principal back down on its policy after it was accused of ‘ @entity70 ’			0
the ban stopped @entity25 pupils wearing the niqab , the full facial veil in which only the eyes are visible , or the burqa where the eyes are covered with mesh			1
but the college was attacked for its stance by local councillors , mps and the @entity83			0
the @entity6 mp posted a string of controversial tweets in light of recent events concerning full - face veils among the tweets hitting back at the mp ’s comments were from @entity25 commentator @entity91			1
he said : ‘ poor @entity1 ’s twitter feed has become a total car crash of bigotry , @entity70 , historical ignorance and exceptionalism			2
’ he added : ‘ do you accept and support the right of a woman to dress as she wishes ? ’ one woman asked the mp on @entity18 : ‘ how about asking a woman who wears niqab what she thinks about her freedom ? or does her opinion not matter ? ’ a student at @entity60 wears a full veil after the college reversed its position which previously banned students from wearing niqabs so they could be ' easily identifiable at all times ' the wearing of veils in public faces another test in court today			1
a judge at @entity118 in @entity119 allowed a woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , to plead not guilty while wearing her veil last month			2
she argued she was unable to remove the face covering in the presence of men for religious reasons , but as a compromise she allowed a female police officer in a room next to the courtroom to lift it to check her identity			2
the judge will now decide on whether she will be able to wear her veil during her trial for intimidating a witness , as he feared jurors would not be able to see her facial expressions during questioning			0
a veil ban at the @entity141 college had been in place for eight years without protest			0
but an anonymous prospective student complained to her local paper , saying that she was being discriminated against , and the publicity sparked an online campaign			0
@entity60 is believed to be the only college in the @entity39 to have banned the niqab			2
some 43 per cent of its 44,000 students come from ethnic groups that are non white			0
an online petition was signed by 9,000 people , amid rumours that the college was also planning to ban prayers on its premises			0
the college was forced to amend its policy , which also covered hoodies and hats , which had been brought in to make sure students were always ‘ easily identifiable ’ .			0
