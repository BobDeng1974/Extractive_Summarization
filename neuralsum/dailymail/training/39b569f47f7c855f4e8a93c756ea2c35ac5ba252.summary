@entity0 will be an interested spectator as the first event of the @entity3 's @entity2 gets under way in @entity5 on thursday			1
@entity0 holds a commanding lead of more than three million points over @entity8 as he looks to win the race to @entity10 and @entity11 money list titles for the second time in three years			1
however , the world number one is missing both the @entity14 and @entity16 events in @entity17 in order to prepare for a court case with his former management company , increasing the admittedly slim possibility of being overhauled by the likes of @entity8 and current @entity26 number one @entity24			1
@entity0 , pictured at the @entity27 , will sit out the @entity14 and the @entity16 event @entity0 has a commanding lead in the race to @entity10 and is unlikely to be overtaken @entity8 and @entity24 will not be at @entity30 either this week , with the @entity31 opting to compete in the @entity32 in @entity33 on the @entity11 instead , while @entity24 withdrew following the birth of his third child on sunday			1
each event in the @entity2 has a prize pool of 10 million points with 1,666,600 going to the winner , while @entity0 is guaranteed to earn at least the 27,170 points on offer for last place in the season - ending @entity43			1
that will take the 25 - year - old 's total to just over 5.4million , meaning his rivals will need to have reached at least 3.8million before @entity10 to have a chance of overhauling the four - time major winner			1
for @entity8 , who has committed to play in the @entity16 and the @entity51 , that equates to a runner - up and top - five finish , while @entity24 will need even better results to keep his hopes alive			1
@entity8 , pictured in action at the @entity27 , has a slim chance of winning the race to @entity10 @entity0 poses with his @entity59 at the @entity61 golf course in @entity62 with so many points on offer , all of the top 20 players have a chance of being within striking distance of @entity0 with a first and second place finish over the next three weeks , but eighth - placed @entity70 has other goals in mind			1
the top 15 players after @entity10 will share a bonus pool of 5million @entity75 dollars and @entity76 is also looking to move up from his current position of sixth in the world rankings			2
' i 'm not sure i can catch @entity0 but the bonus pool runs deep down to 15th and i want to strengthen my world ranking as much as possible , ' the 2013 @entity82 champion told a pre-tournament press conference			2
' if i can play well and maybe win a couple of tournaments between now and the end of the season , i could probably get up to second in the world , which would be a personal best			0
so there 's always something to play for			0
' @entity76 warmed up for the @entity14 by beating @entity27 team - mate @entity96 in a match to mark the opening of a course they designed in @entity101 , continuing his excellent match play form after being @entity26 's top points scorer at @entity104 last month			2
@entity70 takes part in the @entity106 at @entity30 ahead of the first day of the @entity14 @entity76 plays out of the sand on wednesday , a day before attempting to improve his world ranking in @entity17 @entity96 is a lowly 64th on the money list after just one top - five finish on the @entity3 this season , but is looking to continue his impressive record in the @entity114			2
the 38 - year - old was 15th at @entity30 last year and fourth in 2012 , as well as having won in @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			0
' i 've got a decent record here in @entity121 , ' @entity96 said			0
' i played very strong the back end of last year			0
i 've played well on this golf course in the past , so i 'm looking forward to getting going			0
' i 've been close here			0
i like the layout , i like the way it looks , and if the weather holds off for us and is kind then it 's going to be a great week			0
' the success over here obviously means that i 've got a good following , and hopefully that may long continue			0
