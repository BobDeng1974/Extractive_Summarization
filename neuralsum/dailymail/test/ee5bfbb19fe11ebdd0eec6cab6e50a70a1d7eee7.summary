psychologists and wellness experts have long - known that we 're at our happiest when we 're doing the things we love			1
but , according to one new study , a third of @entity6 women are not finding time for their hobbies and passions			1
the survey of 1,025 @entity6 parents , conducted by @entity12 , found that more women had foregone personal interests for work commitments or to finance ' more important ' things in the last week , than had men			1
the cost , says clinical psychologist and @entity21 wellness expert dr @entity20 , will be our happiness - and potentially that of our children			0
according to a recent study of more than 1,000 @entity6 parents , a third of @entity6 women are not finding time for their hobbies , choosing work and ' more important things ' over their passions ' we know that we tend to gravitate towards hobbies and interests that use our best strengths but a lot of the other things we do in our lives , including work , do not , ' dr @entity20 told @entity39			1
' this is why it 's so important for us to consciously do more of the things that bring us joy			1
' dr @entity20 says changing work spaces and technology do contribute to stress and brain overload			2
' we know that we ’re filling life with more info , we know that technology has so many pros - but the information we ’re exposed to grows exponentially , ' she says			0
' we have to look at how we can break up a day at work because its abnormal for a brain to focus on a screen for 8 plus hours a day			2
' ' remember the brain is wired to pay attention , the brains will just keep processing information to the point of exhaustion , so we actually have to take more care of ourselves			0
otherwise , we run the risk of over-stressing our brains , by actually not doing very much			0
' clinical psychologist and @entity66 dr @entity20 says its important to create space for the things we love to be happy one interesting finding to come out of the recent survey , dr @entity20 says , is that twenty per cent of women are inspired to start new hobbies through social media			1
' being inspired is a great thing , so long as that translates into our real lives , ' she says			0
' if it does n't , it can actually add another layer of stress			0
' ' what we 're seeing is that women could actually be more inspired than ever before , right at the time that we 're also more time poor			1
' so how can we create more space in our lives for the things we love ? dr @entity20 says its important to be pragmatic			1
' we have to look at our lives and ask : " what can go ? " ' she says			0
' it 's not about loading more onto our lives , we 've all done that , if we 're going to add something in , something else has to go , or we 're just going to feel overloaded			0
' spending time doing things you love with friends has the advantage of the ' accountability ' factor , dr @entity20 says			1
dr @entity20 also emphasises the importance of being organised			0
' get prepared , ' she says			0
' whatever your hobby or interest is , recognise that you 're actually going to need the gear to do it			0
' next time an unexpected pocket of free time opens up , you can take advantage of it if you 've got the craft stuff you need at hand , for example , or your runners under your desk at work			1
' other tips include spending more time sharing your passions with friends - this has the added ' accountability factor ' - and giving to others , perhaps by volunteering your time to others			1
' make a list , then pick one or pick two things you love – you can shelve the other stuff for another time - it ’s there , the seed has been planted , ' dr @entity20 says finally , dr @entity20 says women should include their ' little people ' in the things they love because hobbies and passions are created in childhood			1
another worrying statistic that was revealed in the @entity12 survey is that 85 per cent of younger @entity6 , specifically @entity136 respondents , said they have also stopped pursing interests that they are passionate about because they feel they should be spending money on ' more important things ' or using their time to complete work or home duties			1
according to dr @entity20 , the current situation of parents failing to pursue the things they love is concerning for generations to come because it sets a dangerous cultural norm in @entity6			1
pursuing past - times and creative outlets has a positive impact on children , she says and promotes healthy lifestyle choices for teenagers and young adults			2
lighten your load prioritising your commitments and saying ‘ no ’ occasionally can free up your time			1
use your breaks lunch breaks , coffee runs or public transport commutes provide you with opportunities to take time out			2
be prepared being prepared can help you take advantage of opportunities			0
carry your camera with you , store a journal in your bag , leave a pair of running shoes at work			2
commute creatively create a @entity176 board on your tablet ( like an @entity178 ) , discover new artists on @entity180 or read a magazine about your hobby			0
include friends combining your social commitments with your passion is a great way to go			2
it help enhance your feeling of connectedness with your peers while providing you a creative or physical outlet			0
prioritise passions focus your efforts on one or two interests at a time			1
remember , you can revisit other projects later when you have more free time			2
pledge a commitment joining a club or engaging a coach to mentor you will do two things : continually motivate you and challenge you to further develop your skills			2
involve your little people many of our hobbies begin in childhood , so share yours with the little people in your life			2
childhood is all about learning and exposing your children to new activities			0
it helps their brain strengthen old connections and make new ones			0
make it work with only 9 % of @entity6 admitting they ’re very happy at work , it ’s time to get creative and find ways to enhance your workplace			1
instead of attending another office meeting , suggest a walking meeting or build staff members ’ hobbies into team - building activities			0
gifts that give try volunteering or coaching to stay connected to your passion			0
when you commit your time to others , you ’re more likely to leave work on time and prioritise your hobbies .			1
