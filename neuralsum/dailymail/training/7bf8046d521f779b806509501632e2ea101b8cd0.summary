by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:53 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 13:18 est , 1 january 2013 @entity2 , who is being held with the most significant terrorism suspects in @entity5 custody , has apparently gained extensive knowledge of western pop culture in @entity9 's @entity8 an inmate who is imprisoned alongside ' high value ' terrorism suspects in the most secretive of @entity9 camps has somehow learned about @entity15 , his lawyer has revealed			1
@entity16 , an @entity17 man who became the last prisoner sent to @entity9 after he was accused of helping @entity19 elude capture five years ago , has written a series of letters to lawyer @entity23 , revealing a startling knowledge about western culture			1
across the letters , he refers to @entity27 , @entity28 and the global video hit of @entity31 singer psy - hardly what you 'd expect from a middle - age @entity17 who has never been to the @entity5 ' dear mr. @entity23 , ' he wrote			1
' i like this new song @entity15			2
i want to do the dance for you but can not because of my shackles			2
' in another letter , the @entity41 shows some familiarity with @entity5 slang			2
he tells his lawyer , most likely in jest , that he has adopted a banana rat , a rodent commonly spotted around the @entity5 base in @entity50			1
' tell the guards to leave my friend alone			2
' @entity31 rapper @entity53 has become a global phenomenon with his signature song and dance , ' @entity15 ' the letters come as a surprise as little has been heard about @entity41 since his capture			1
he was interrogated at an undisclosed location then locked away in @entity9 's @entity8 , a prison unit shrouded in secrecy that holds about 15 men who have been designated ' high value ' detainees			1
the letters suggest that the prisoners in @entity8 , a group that includes five charged with aiding and orchestrating the september 11 terror attack , are not completely isolated from the outside world			1
to @entity23 , a federal public defender for the @entity72 of @entity73 , the letters humanize a man who he contends has been demonized by @entity5 authorities , who allege he worked as a translator and assistant to @entity19 and other @entity80 leaders			2
the lawyer says the letters demonstrate a surprising amount of resilience			1
' it shows he 's different and he 's intelligent , ' @entity23 said			0
' just think that he 's doing this under all the restrictions that 's he 's under down there			0
he has an incredibly good sense of humor			0
' there have been letters released to the media in the past from other detainees at @entity9 , often providing valuable information about the prison			1
@entity99 said that he can not do @entity53 's signature moves because of his shackles the @entity103 document says @entity41 began helping the @entity104 in the 1990s and that job morphed into working for @entity80			2
it cites two other prisoners and an undisclosed source identifying @entity41 as a close associate of @entity19			0
@entity41 was captured in @entity110 in 2007 and turned over to the @entity111 , in whose custody he was subjected to prolonged sleep deprivation			0
he was transferred to @entity9 in march 2008			0
in photos taken by the @entity115 at @entity8 , and obtained by the @entity1 from the prisoner 's family in @entity17 , @entity41 has a long flowing beard			1
in one , he smiles broadly at the camera			0
it is unclear how the prisoner learned so much of @entity123 pop culture from @entity124 in @entity9 , located in @entity50 the first letters from @entity41 released by @entity23 were in june , including one in which he disclosed that @entity127 , a former @entity128 resident who pleaded guilty to aiding @entity80 , had acquired a cat at @entity8 , which @entity1 reported at the time			1
the @entity131 and prison officials declined comment and said they could not discuss conditions of confinement for high - value detainees , although they added that prisoners are not permitted to have pets			1
@entity99 was accused of helping the @entity139 go into hiding ; here , @entity19 's house in @entity143 , @entity110 the rest of the letters came during or after subsequent visits by @entity23 , who had them cleared by the military before releasing them to the @entity1 none are more than a few sentences , and contain many typographical errors , which have been corrected for this story for the sake of clarity			1
in one , @entity41 returns to the theme of his fellow prisoner 's alleged cat			0
' i want a dog , ' he writes			0
' i will train my dog to chase @entity127 's cat			0
' @entity139 was killed in his home on may 1 , 2011 in separate notes , he asks @entity23 to appeal for help from radio personality @entity27			1
' if he is the ' @entity27 ' he can help me			0
' in another , he criticizes @entity28 ' ' fair and @entity169 ' slogan , writing that if that were true the channel ' would not have to say it every five minutes			0
' how he came by this information is not clear			0
a prison spokesman , @entity175 capt. @entity174 , wo n't discuss life in @entity8 but he says that " where satellite television and radio is available for detainees , " they have access to a wide variety of channels in @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and other languages			1
the line - up , however , apparently does not include @entity27 or @entity192			2
with no internet access , he could have picked up such information from other shows or through @entity23 , who has spent hours with him and delivered magazines such as @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			0
the @entity5 military will not say when or if @entity41 will be charged			0
his name does not appear on the list of detainees who have been cleared for release from @entity9 and his name was not among those mentioned as possible candidates for an exchange with the @entity104 as part of a peace deal .			0
