by @entity0 a 94 - year - old war hero has branded his local council ‘ nazis ’ for slapping him with a parking fine - after he left his car to help his elderly neighbour onto a bus			1
@entity8 , who defused dozens of unexploded bombs under @entity10 during the @entity11 , says he is prepared to go to prison rather than pay the £ 105 penalty			1
and he claims he has proof the ticket was issued illegally after it printed the incorrect time on the notice			2
outraged : @entity8 ( pictured right as a bomb specialist in 1941 ) has branded @entity19 ' after he was fined for parking illegally for an hour			1
he claims he only stopped for two minutes controversy : mr @entity8 , 94 , has appealed the fine claiming he stopped at 1.54pm not 12.54pm as stated the determined grandfather - of - nine accepts he parked in a restricted area when he dropped his elderly neighbour off at the bus station in @entity26 , @entity27 , on may 16			1
he claims he left the car for two minutes when he helped his neighbour board the bus and when he returned he found a yellow parking ticket slapped on his windscreen			1
but the time on the £ 35 fine claimed the violation took place at 12.54pm , when in fact he had dropped off his neighbour at 1.54pm			1
despite appealing the fine - which has now risen to £ 105 - the council refused to back down and mr @entity8 has now been warned he faces legal action if he does not cough up			1
but defiant mr @entity8 , who lives in @entity40 , @entity27 , said : ' the council do n’t frighten me			1
' they can say what they want but i know i was n’t anywhere near @entity26 at the time they say - i can prove it because my neighbour ’s bus ticket states she got on the bus at 1.54pm			1
' they made a mistake and they are trying to make me pay for it			0
' they ’re acting like bullying nazis			0
well , they do n’t scare me			0
i dealt with a lot worse things in the war			0
' i used to dig down 40 feet to defuse unexploded bombs			2
some of them weighed a tonne if they ’d gone up they would have taken half of @entity10 with them			0
' the council should try doing that job			0
' i only tell the truth , i was n’t in @entity26 at 12.54			0
' i ’m not going to pay the fine			0
if i ’d paid at first it would have been £ 35			2
now , it ’s £ 105			1
it ’s not the cost			0
defiant : the grandfather - of - nine said he will go to jail before paying the fine , which has now risen to £ 105 fighter : mr @entity8 ( circled ) , of @entity27 , defused bombs under @entity10 during the @entity11 ' they can take me to court			1
if it means going to jail then i ’ll go to jail			0
' when i got back to the car , the @entity90 was putting the ticket on the windscreen			2
' i tried to explain to him what had happened but he did n’t want to know			0
' he gave me the ticket and then walked off , he was a right so - and - so			2
' i was upset and it ’s only when i looked at the ticket and saw it was issued at 12.54pm			2
' if , as the council says , the ticket was rightly issued at 12.54pm , that means i must have parked outside the bus station for over an hour			1
serving : here he is pictured ( left ) with his fellow soldiers and a g mine 1000kg bomb in @entity107 in june 1945 ' that ’s not right , i was there two or three minutes at most			2
' there are plenty of people who saw us when we were still in @entity40 at 12.54pm who will swear on oath they saw me nowhere near the bus station			0
' today , @entity19 , who are responsible for the bus station , refused to back down on the fine			1
a spokesman said : ' when @entity122 ( @entity123 ) are issued , photographic evidence is usually taken by the civil enforcement officer to evidence the offence			0
' whilst it is not appropriate to comment on individual cases in the public domain , there is a process available to anyone who wishes to dispute a @entity123 can ask that the matter be heard by the @entity134 which is an independent body that listens to evidence from both parties and then makes a decision on the case based on the evidence that is presented to them			0
