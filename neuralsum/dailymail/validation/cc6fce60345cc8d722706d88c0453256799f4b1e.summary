the @entity0 chancellor has angrily rejected demands from @entity11 ministers for @entity12 to pay £ 240billion in compensation for @entity15 atrocities during the @entity16			1
but , in an astonishing twist , senior members of the @entity18 , which shares power with mrs @entity7 , yesterday disagreed			0
senior figures in chancellor @entity7 's coalition partner in government have united with the @entity24 to declare @entity0 should compensate @entity2 to the tune of billions of pounds for wartime @entity15 atrocities @entity27 said : ‘ i think it would be good for us @entity0 to sweep up after ourselves in terms of our history			1
it is about recognising that we have committed serious wrongs in @entity2			2
‘ the government ’s legal case is n’t convincing			0
it leaves a bad impression that @entity0 does n’t want to face up to its responsibilities			2
’ @entity39 , @entity18 deputy leader , said : ‘ we should not link the question of compensation with the current debate on the euro crisis			0
but i am of the opinion that we need to discuss compensation regardless			0
’ @entity24 parliamentary group leader @entity47 said : ‘ neither morally nor legally is this chapter complete			0
’ about 250,000 @entity11 died during the brutal @entity15 occupation			1
@entity2 ’s new hard - left rulers are demanding billions in return			2
justice minister @entity52 said this month that @entity0 assets in @entity2 could be seized			2
@entity54 is demanding general compensation as well as specific claims for massacres and forced loans			2
