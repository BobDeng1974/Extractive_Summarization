a senior judge has condemned pre-nuptial agreements claiming that the only reason people want them is to give their partner less than they are entitled to in the event of a marital breakthrough			1
@entity8 of @entity9 was commenting after one leading family law firm said that the demand for such documents has increased by 50 per cent			1
the @entity13 also recommended back in february that pre-nuptial agreements should be made legally binding in @entity15 courts			1
@entity8 of @entity9 , pictured , cautioned against the use of pre-nuptial agreements justice secretary @entity17 has already commented that implementing such agreements is a sensible proposition			1
@entity8 said : ' i am very suspicious of prenuptial agreements ' as they are designed ' almost always to give someone less than they would be otherwise entitled to '			2
@entity25 , family solicitor at @entity26 told @entity27 : ' prenups are no longer just used by oligarchs or celebrities looking to protect vast wealth			0
since the publicity around the @entity35 's recommendations , people have more confidence that a pre-nuptial agreement could be taken seriously by the courts			2
' younger people in particular are becoming more pragmatic about prenups			0
it is not about a lack of trust or an expectation that the marriage will fail - they recognise that by thinking ahead about what financial responsibilities they would face in the event of a divorce , they can reduce the possibility of an acrimonious and expensive break - up in the future			0
' anyone who has assets to protect is starting to view the prenup as a sensible precaution , a bit like making a will			0
' earlier this year when the prenuptial agreement proposals were published , professor @entity61 , law commissioner for property , family and trust law , said : ' pre- and post-nuptial agreements are becoming more commonplace but the courts will not always follow them and lawyers are therefore not able to give clear advice about their effect			2
' the measures we are recommending would help couples understand and meet their financial responsibilities and , where appropriate , achieve financial independence			0

@entity8 of @entity9 has *warned* against pre-nuptial agreements
