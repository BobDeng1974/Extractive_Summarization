@entity0 was breaking as we pulled out of @entity3 station , and the town 's medieval citadel , perched on a headland , was bathed in the rosy glow of the first rays of sunlight			1
trundling along the coast on the narrow - gauge railway , i was heading deep into the mountains of central @entity14 for a self - guided walking trip			1
' are you doing the @entity17 ? ' was the question on everyone 's lips as soon as they spotted my hiking boots			1
i responded with an emphatic ' non '			2
the trail , which runs down the mountainous spine of the island , happens to be the toughest trek in @entity28			2
the @entity29 , or mountain sheep , make easy work of the tough @entity17 hiking trail the @entity17 trail runs down the mountainous spine of @entity14 and happens to be the toughest trek in @entity28 i had chosen a much gentler route , or so i thought			1
i was following the ancient @entity36 , footpaths used for more than 1,000 years by shepherds leading their animals to summer pastures			1
it started in the remote @entity42 , a wild and desolate canyon flanked by barren cliffs			0
after trudging up a stony ledge high above the valley floor the first morning , i began to wonder what i had taken on			0
over the following days i found myself scrambling over dry river beds , scaling rock - strewn gullies and clinging to cable handrails as i inched across wobbly suspension bridges			2
everywhere i looked the views were jaw - dropping			2
fortunately , i was travelling in comfort with my luggage transported from one hotel to the next , so all i needed was a daypack and water bottles filled to the brim			0
the @entity42 , where the ancient @entity36 used for more than 1,000 years begins most of the trails were clearly marked with orange daubs of paint and i was equipped with maps and detailed instructions			1
even so , there were times when i got hopelessly lost			0
accommodation ranged from small auberges to family - run hotels			1
the first night i stopped at the @entity69 , a simple b&b in @entity70 , where i was welcomed by owner @entity71 with @entity72 and home - made fruitcake in her shady garden			2
each morning i would set off early to avoid the blistering midday sun. the average hike was five to seven hours and at times i walked for ages without meeting another soul			0
the water below one of the hiking track 's footbridges proves too enticing to not jump in for a swim sometimes i 'd pause beside little packhorse bridges to dangle my feet in water that was as clear as gin			1
at the @entity89 , an emerald rock pool in the midst of the pine trees , i took a deep breath and plunged in up to my neck for a refreshing dip			0
it was cold as ice			0
i stayed at the @entity98 further up the hillside which served hearty @entity14 fare in its panoramic restaurant			0
tucking into @entity102 , a wild boar casserole , i watched a crimson sun slip below the sea			0
next day i decided to cheat and cut short the itinerary			0
after trekking through the beautiful @entity107 , i caught a cab to the seaside resort of @entity110 where a 16th century @entity112 tower stands guard over the harbour			1
after trekking through the beautiful @entity107 ( pictured ) , @entity115 took a cab to @entity110 ( below ) a 16th century @entity112 tower stands guard over the harbour in the seaside resort of @entity110 a packhorse bridge on @entity115 ’s route , which can be walked for ages without seeing another person @entity124 ( 0845 330 2113 ) offers a seven - night @entity125 selfguided walking tour from £ 1,049pp including return flights from @entity128 or @entity129 , five nights ' half - board and two nights ' b&b , transfers and luggage transfers , maps and guide notes			1
@entity138 ( 0800 1313 777 ) offers a choice of @entity141 airport hotels			2
joining the @entity142 for a boat trip , i looked up at the remains of fortifications built on impossibly steep precipices			0
we sailed along the @entity148 , a series of rocky inlets , caves and sea cliffs which have been sculpted into exotic shapes by constant erosion			0
it was as if @entity156 had fashioned battlements , spires and organ pipes			0
i was to see them close - up on my final hike along the cliffs to @entity164 in the village of @entity166			2
flinging open the shutters the last morning , i was greeted by an unforgettable sight			0
the entire @entity169 of @entity110 lay below me			1
i promised myself i 'd be back to do a coastal walk or - who knows - maybe i will attempt the @entity17			1
the stunning coastline of @entity14 that has been sculpted by constant erosion a final hike along the cliffs led @entity115 to @entity164 in the village of @entity166 the remarkable view of the @entity169 of @entity110 that can be seen from the balcony of @entity164			1
