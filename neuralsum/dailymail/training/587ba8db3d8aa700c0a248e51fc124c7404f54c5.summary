it ’s every cyclist ’s nightmare – discovering that they have run out of water half way up a hill on a sweltering day			0
but the days of topping up water bottles may soon be over , now that one designer has created a bottle that collects and condenses moisture from the air while a bike is in motion			1
the prototype ‘ @entity14 ’ device uses the principle of thermoelectric cooling to fill up a bottle with water when attached to a bike frame			1
the ‘ @entity14 ’ bottle uses the principle of thermoelectric cooling to fill up with water when attached to a bike frame ( pictured )			1
it 's named after the @entity26 god of wells and springs @entity29 , an industrial design student at the @entity31 in @entity32 came up with the idea , and a finalist in the 2014 @entity35			1
named after the @entity26 god of wells and springs , the upper part of the bottle holder is cooled by electricity generated by solar panels , while the bottom heats up			1
this means that as the bike moves , air is sucked inside and moves through the upper chamber of the holder , where it cools down			0
the air condenses into water and drips into the bottle attatched below			0
‘ useful on long bike tours , the constant search for freshwater sources such as rivers and gas stations can cease to be an issue since the bottle automatically fills itself up , ’ he wrote on the @entity35 website			1
the upper part of the bottle is cooled by electricity generated by solar panels , while the bottom heats up			1
this means that as the bike moves , air is sucked inside and moves through the upper chamber of the bottle , where it cools down			2
it condenses into water and drips into the bottle ( a cross section of the design is shown ) the bike - mounted device that the bottle attaches to , has a small cooler at its centre called @entity79			2
this cooler is divided in two			0
solar panels generate electricity to cool the upper part down , while the bottom side warms up			2
as air enters the bottom chamber of the bottle at high speed - when the bike is moving forwards - the hot side of the device is cooled down , which in turn cools the cold side further			1
when the air enters the top chamber it is stopped with ' little walls ' that are perforated , and the water condenses			0
droplets flow through a pope into the bottle , which can be turned into a vertical position and loosened			0
any standard 500ml bottle can be used			0
mr @entity29 said that the device can harvest half a litre of water in an hour under the right climatic conditions - in temperatures of around 20 ° @entity109 ) and 50 per cent humidity			1
the bottle has a filter to keep dust out of the water , but does not yet purify it , which may be important the @entity14 bottle is used in a polluted city			2
he told @entity117 that the prototype cost between $ 25 ( £ 16 ) and $ 40 ( £ 26 ) to make , but he plans on refining the design before bringing it to market and setting a price for consumers			0
mr @entity29 has not ruled out raising money via crowdfunding and aside from consumer cycling applications , believes the product could be used to acquire fresh water in regions of the world where groundwater is scarce but air humidity is high			1
‘ harvesting water from the air is a method that has been practised for more than 2,000 years in certain cultures mostly in @entity136 and @entity137 , ’ he said			2
‘ the @entity139 ’s atmosphere contains around 8,077 cubic miles ( 13,000 km3 ) of mostly unexploited freshwater			0
this project is an attempt to discover these resources			0
’ the bottle may be able to help the two billion people in more than 40 countries who live in regions with water scarcity			2
it is predicted that 47 per cent of the world ’s population will be living in areas of high water stress in 2030			0

a diagram of the different parts of the device is shown			0

‘ @entity14 ’ bottle uses the principle of thermoelectric cooling to fill up with water when attached to a device on a moving bike frame
it 's the *brainchild* of a student at the @entity31 in @entity32
prototype bottle is cooled by solar panels to help water condense inside it
it 's intended for long bike rides and works best at around 20 ° @entity184 )
bottle could also be used to acquire fresh water in regions of the world where groundwater is scarce but air humidity is high
