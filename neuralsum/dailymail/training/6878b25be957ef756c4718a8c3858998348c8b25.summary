for all the best from our brilliant @entity1 , click here			2
for @entity7 , it was desperate , frantic backs - to - the - wall stuff by time up			1
@entity9 spoke afterwards of feeling drained by a night of heroic graft and he was n’t alone			0
this is the kind of night likely to prove the difference between qualification and a perennial hard - luck tale			2
they clung on in the end			0
an engrossing , pulsating @entity19 qualifier ended in an excellent , valuable point			0
yet with 15 minutes to play the @entity21 promised so much more			2
recovering from a wretched start and the loss of an early goal , they somehow eked out the lead via strikes from @entity28 and @entity29			1
the brilliance of @entity31 dragged @entity32 back into it and , but for the width of a goalpost in the dying minutes , this might have been a desperate tale of woe for @entity9 ’s team			1
they rode their luck in the final stages			0
yet a home win over @entity43 and a return of four points from a possible six was tarnished only by a late @entity47 equaliser against @entity48			2
@entity9 calls @entity49 the group of death , but in this developing team life and energy abounds			1
@entity55 ( left ) opens the scoring for @entity32 early in the match as he fires the ball past a lunging @entity59 @entity55 celebrates by sliding along the pitch as the hosts take an early lead against @entity7 in @entity63 @entity59 ( right ) looks dejected after his error which led to @entity55 giving @entity32 the lead in the 11th minute @entity28 scores the equaliser for @entity7 just seven minutes after going 1 - 0 down to @entity32 @entity28 ( centre ) jumps in the air as he celebrates his equaliser with @entity70 ( right ) and @entity29 @entity32 : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 ( @entity77 89 ) , @entity78 , @entity55 , @entity79 ( @entity80 63 ) , @entity31 , @entity81 subs not used : @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 goal : @entity55 11 , @entity31 76 booked : @entity78 , @entity80 manager : @entity95 @entity7 : @entity96 , @entity59 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity29 ( @entity97 71 ) , @entity28 , @entity102 , @entity103 ( @entity104 71 ) subs not used : @entity9 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , may goal : @entity28 18 , @entity29 57 booked : @entity98 manager : @entity9 referee : @entity117 ( @entity118 ) there were fine performances all over here			1
@entity70 – again – @entity97 , @entity100 , and the unheralded @entity98 - a late stand - in for @entity122 no less - were simply superb			1
‘ @entity98 was fantastic , ’ said the @entity7 manager			1
‘ he looks nothing like a football player - he looks like a rock star who ’s turned up at a testimonial game			1
but he is absolutely fantastic			0
i thought his partner also did well			0
’ @entity99 was an unexpected replacement for @entity113 at left back and also earned the praise of his manager			0
‘ @entity99 ? you put him on there and you know what you are going to get , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ if you had 10 @entity138 you would sleep a lot easier the night before the game , trust me			0
he ca n’t play in goals , that ’s why i only said 10			0
’ yet the night got off to a deeply inauspicious start			0
backed by a partisan and raucous home support , @entity32 took the lead in 11 minutes with a goal which was cheap and avoidable			1
it was also a personal disaster for @entity59			1
the @entity149 right - back earned plaudits for his performance in the weekend win over @entity43 , a result which invigorated a campaign that began with defeat in @entity48			2
seeking to cut out a speculative , chipped through ball outside his own area , he took a poor touch with the outside of his heel directing the ball straight into the path of @entity55 in a shooting position			1
the midfielder ’s calm , controlled low sidefooted shot rebounded off the inside of the post and into the net			2
@entity59 sank to his backside on the turf as team - mates looked accusingly in his direction			1
in the space - age , cavernous environs of @entity63 ’s @entity179 it was an ominous development			2
a repeat of the friendly victory here in march already looked improbable			0
but the @entity21 showed depth and reserves of strength			0
under @entity9 they know how to work their way back into a game			0
and it took them just six minutes to do it			2
a fine goal it was , too , the pre-match recovery of @entity70 from an injury scare proving an act of mercy from the footballing gods			1
the @entity201 man conjured a superb first touch from @entity204 ’s spearing , diagonal long ball , plucking it out of the air on the left of the area and playing a pinpoint cut back to @entity28 10 yards from goal			1
the former @entity212 player had scored just twice in 34 international appearances , but showed great poise to steer a low , placed shot into the net			1
with 17 minutes played , this lively football match stood at 1 - 1			1
@entity29 ( left ) attempts to challenge @entity32 's @entity76 in the air during the @entity219 qualifier @entity70 ( left ) is airborne as he makes the challenge on @entity32 's @entity78 in the first half @entity32 forward @entity222 ( left ) and @entity7 's @entity99 vie for the ball @entity81 ( right ) charges forward with the ball as @entity7 's @entity101 gives chase @entity7 goalkeeper @entity96 punches the ball under pressure from @entity32 's @entity228 as @entity81 also jumps in the air the equaliser had a calming effect on @entity7			1
frankly , they looked the more dangerous team			0
in 38 minutes @entity99 more than justified the decision to pick him at @entity113 ’s expense when he denied the @entity238 a certain second goal			2
@entity81 , the shining star of this @entity238 team , looked odds on to convert after @entity222 ghosted in behind the @entity21 rearguard and guided @entity75 ’s through ball towards goal			0
@entity99 hacked it to safety			0
@entity7 breathed again and made it to half - time intact			1
within 12 minutes of the restart they went a stage further , silencing the 55,197 crowd with a stunning second goal			2
@entity7 ’s set - pieces had been poor of late , so when @entity28 was fouled 30 yards from goal the fans were hardly holding their breath in anticipation			1
but this time @entity100 ’s free kick found its way through a static @entity238 defence , @entity29 reacting to prod the ball low into the corner of the net from 10 yards out			1
the regret for @entity7 was that half an hour of the match still remained			1
inevitably they began to fall deep			0
@entity268 played its part , of course			0
@entity29 ( right ) gets the slightest of touches on the ball and puts it in the back of the net to move @entity7 2 - 1 ahead @entity7 players celebrate after @entity29 's goal puts them 2 - 1 ahead against hosts @entity32 in a crucial @entity19 qualifier @entity31 ( second left ) fires towards goal as @entity32 equalise against @entity7 with just 14 minutes to go milik wheels away in celebration as the home support celebrates his equaliser in @entity63 on tuesday @entity32 's @entity78 ( left ) jumps in for the challenge on @entity7 's @entity100 by the sideline @entity31 , the @entity238 @entity289 , posed the greatest threat of damage			1
he headed a more than decent opening onto the roof of the net from close range			0
with 20 minutes to play his low , driven cross then ran menacingly across the face of @entity7 ’s goal , requiring the merest of touches to draw the @entity238 level			1
the minutes , by now , were ticking past excruciatingly slowly			2
@entity9 opted for fresh legs			0
@entity303 replaced the goalscorer @entity29 while @entity306 ’s @entity305 took @entity204 ’s place up front			2
and within seconds the @entity21 came so close to going 3 - 1 ahead			1
@entity102 ’s run to the left touchline ended in a piercing deep cross to the back post area where @entity28 controlled and lashed a right foot shot towards the top of the net			1
@entity71 – outstanding against @entity48 – pushed the ball over the bar at the last second			0
had it gone in it was game over			0
@entity7 would have taken all three points			1
here 's @entity28 's equaliser for @entity7 in the 17th minute ... for more from our brilliant @entity1 , click here @entity7 players leave the field after earning a hard - fought point against @entity32 in the @entity19 qualifer @entity100 ( left ) applauds the fans as he and @entity7 manager @entity9 leave the pitch in @entity63 after claiming a point the @entity7 team and mascots line up for national anthem " @entity334 " ahead of kick - off in @entity63 the travelling @entity336 make plenty of noise ahead of kick - off in the big match at the @entity179 in @entity63 @entity32 supporters cheer and show their colours as the atmosphere reaches fever pitch at the @entity19 qualifier but the margins at this level are slim			1
@entity9 ’s team were dropping deep			0
what came next was brutal both in its significance and its creativity			0
with 14 minutes to play , @entity75 played a neat reverse pass in behind the hapless @entity59 , @entity31 thrashing an outstanding left foot shot which fizzed past @entity96 ’s outstretched hands to scenes of enormous joy and no little @entity238 relief			1
the home nation were working up a head of steam			0
an impassioned support bayed for the winning goal , demanded it , indeed			0
within minutes they almost had it			2
@entity81 worked an opening to thrash a rasping right foot shot towards goal , @entity96 saving brilliantly			0
then came a quite incredible let - off for the visitors six minutes from time			2
@entity31 , a repeated thorn in @entity7 ’s side , lashed an angled shot against the outside of the post after some delightful lead - up play			1
the ball fell invitingly to @entity76 who seemed certain to thrash it into the net before the ball skidded wide			0
@entity238 heads were in hands			0
they knew , as we all did , that their final chance had come and gone .			0

@entity32 took the lead in the 11th minute as @entity55 took *advantage* of an @entity59 mistake
@entity28 equalised for @entity7 just seven minutes later as he scored from a low @entity70 cross
@entity29 had the @entity336 in *raptures* as he put @entity7 2 - 1 ahead in the 57th minute
the hosts turned on the pressure and equalised in the 76th minute *courtesy* of an @entity31 strike
@entity7 now sit in fourth position in @entity49 with four points and take on the @entity402 in *november*
