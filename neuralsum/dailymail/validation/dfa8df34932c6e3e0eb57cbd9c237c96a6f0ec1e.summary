@entity0 last night agreed to a single tv debate during the election campaign			1
the prime minister is expected to attend a seven - way session at the start of april , to be shown on @entity6			1
the deal includes three other political programmes during the campaign in which some of the party leaders will take questions from the public or television interviewers			0
he will also appear on a number of election specials – but without going head to head against @entity22 crucially , the @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity6 and @entity25 appear to have blinked first and dropped their demand for a head - to - head clash between the @entity16 and @entity22			1
and they have backed down from their apparent threat to ‘ empty chair ’ the pm by holding debates with other leaders which he refused to attend			0
@entity35 appeared to deny the validity of the new proposal , insisting it still wanted three debates as originally proposed and accusing the pm of ‘ running scared ’ of a one - to - one with mr @entity22			1
but , in an attempt to nail down the latest agreement , mr @entity0 said the other parties should accept it			1
‘ an offer ’s been made , a deal ’s been accepted , now the other parties must make clear that they accept this deal too , otherwise they will have to bear the responsibility , ’ he said			2
‘ that ’s what happened : a new offer put forward by the broadcasters , led by the @entity23 , to me , i accepted it , in full , on saturday			0
so , i ’m helping to make this debate go ahead			0
the other parties have got to stop running away from this and agree to the debate the broadcasters have now suggested			0
’ labour leader @entity22 and the deputy prime minister @entity56 would only face mr @entity0 in one seven - way debate the latest proposal is thought to have been presented to the parties over the weekend			1
according to @entity62 sources , it includes four potential shows , the first in just nine days ’ time on march 26			2
it will be a @entity25 and @entity24 joint production hosted by @entity66 and featuring the @entity16 and mr @entity22 , one after the other , facing questions from the host and a studio audience			2
the second show will be the only debate and will involve seven party leaders , with the addition of @entity56 , @entity75 , @entity77 leader @entity76 , @entity78 of the @entity79 and the @entity81 leader @entity80			0
it will be broadcast by @entity6 on april 2			0
on april 16 the @entity23 is proposing a ‘ challengers ’ debate featuring the @entity84 , @entity79 , @entity85 and @entity81			1
a week before polling day , on april 30 , the @entity23 will host a 90 - minute @entity89 - style show with mr @entity0 , mr @entity22 and mr @entity56 appearing one after the other to face questions from a tv audience			1
this is a better deal for the @entity95 , who complained that a head - to - head between the other two leaders would prevent them from defending their record in government			0
a @entity35 spokesman said : ‘ no one should be fooled : @entity0 is still running scared of a head - to - head televised debate with @entity22			2
’ n mr @entity0 poked fun at @entity22 for posing for tv cameras in a pokey kitchen that turned out to be one of two in his £ 2.5million @entity112 home			1
‘ i am not saying this to make a point but you should n’t pretend to be something you are not , ’ the prime minister said			2
showing off the open - plan kitchen he and wife @entity119 had installed in @entity120 , he added : ‘ we are lucky , we both work , we were able to spend our own money on this			0
‘ to me , the kitchen is where you spend all your time			0
it needs a sofa you can slump on , a table you can sit at , a kitchen you can cook in , a place children can do their homework			0
’ under the broadcasters ' latest proposal , the @entity62 , @entity95 and @entity35 leaders would appear on @entity89 hosted by @entity135 ( left )			2
@entity0 and @entity22 would be interviewed one after the other in a @entity139 special hosted by @entity66 ( right )			1

prime minister has agreed to one seven - way debate hosted by @entity6
he will also appear on a number of election specials during the campaign
@entity120 said mr @entity0 had accepted the proposal on saturday
comes despite ' final offer ' last week for debate no later than next week
new proposal also sees pm and @entity22 interviewed on march 26
on april 16 there would be a ' challengers special ' for *smaller* parties
then on april 30 , the pm , @entity22 and @entity56 will appear on @entity89
