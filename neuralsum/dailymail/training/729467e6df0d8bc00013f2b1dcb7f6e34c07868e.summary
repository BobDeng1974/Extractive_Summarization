at last @entity0 appears to be coming around to the use of technology			1
i say appears as the man has said many things in the past which have not materialised , such as not standing for his fifth term as president of the world governing body – something he went back on when he announced he would stand again on monday			0
it is often at election time that he comes out with some of these popular proposals which do not materialise - but hopefully this is one that does not fall into that category			1
new ideas : @entity0 hopes to trial the referral system at the 2015 @entity22 tournament in @entity23 major benefit : @entity26 referees such as @entity27 ( pictured ) will benefit from technology for a long time i have advocated football experimenting with systems to see just how , or indeed if , technology can assist referees in their accurate calling of major decisions			1
this was born out of frustration from my time as a top - flight referee and seeing replays of incidents in my games where i had made a clear error but was unable to change my decision - despite being aware that my initial view was likely to be wrong			1
that is incredibly frustrating and technological assistance is well overdue			0
an example of this was during the @entity50 versus @entity53 @entity52 play - off game in november 2009			1
@entity54 clearly handled the ball before crossing it for @entity50 to score their winning goal and qualify for @entity59			0
the referee @entity60 considered giving up refereeing following the incident			2
he knew that something was wrong , as one does in such situations , but he can do nothing about it other than ask the other officials			2
it also seems illogical that the only person who needs to see replays is the one person who can not currently see them			0
it is interesting that @entity0 is suggesting a system whereby the on - field referee has the final decision after a coach or manager has made a challenge			1
that might be the best way , although it is open to abuse by unscrupulous coaches who work in a tactical way			0
there might be a better way and i would encourage @entity0 to try a number of review systems and compare the results			1
questions that should be considered include : the ultimate aim must be to correct the clear and obvious inaccurate decisions made in good faith by the on - field referee			1
if the initiators of reviews are the coaches then a limit on the number of challenges would have to be in place			0
once used , this could mean a terrible error can not be corrected and that would defeat the object of the exercise completely			0
how should it work ? @entity0 ’s system will require a coach / manager to inform the fourth official that they are requesting a decision to be reviewed , rather like a tennis player or cricket captain does with @entity128			1
at the next stoppage in play the fourth official would tell the referee who would then look at a replay of the incident			1
if there is a clear error then he will overturn his decision , if not it will stand			0
how many referrals per team / half / match ? this is to be confirmed but i would expect no more than two challenges per team and possibly only one per half			2
if the challenge proves to be correct then the coach will retain this challenge but if the referee was right then the challenge will have been used			1
when will it be used ? penalties – both those given and those not given , often when simulation is involved			0
the issue with that appeal is the call is often subjective and replays are ambiguous and open to interpretation			0
offside calls that are clearly wrong can be challenged and corrected but only those leading to goals			0
these happen infrequently as @entity26 assistants are so good but the @entity166 - @entity165 game last month would be one which would have benefitted from such legislation			1
finally red card tackles and off - the - ball incidents could also benefit from referees reviewing replays but these might not be covered by this proposal			2
does it strengthen or undermine the referee ? the inability to review glaring errors which everyone knows are wrong undermines referees and giving them the ability to review and correct their mistakes can only help the game			1
of course if one particular referee keeps losing challenges then he will be exposed as a poor referee and that can not be a bad thing			2
the best referees will be highlighted as the best umpires in cricket are			0
it would be good to see how many times referees are actually right			0
how might it be exploited ? allowing coaches to be the instigators of challenges could allow them futile appeals to disrupt play and take the momentum away from opponents			2
imagine a team is 1 - 0 up with five minutes to play and under sustained pressure			1
their coach has two appeals left , so they will use a referral in order to waste time and get tactical instructions out to his team in order to take the ‘ heat ’ out of the game			2
he could then use another review within a minute in order for the game to peter out			0
we all know the coaches who would attempt to do this .			0

@entity223 could handed managers in - game referrals to challenge decisions
@entity0 hopes to trial the new system at the 2015 *u20* @entity52
@entity231 has backed @entity0 's aim to bring in a system to help officials
which causes least *delays* in play ?
which does not *discourage* the referee to make decisions ?
which ends up with the most correct decisions ?
