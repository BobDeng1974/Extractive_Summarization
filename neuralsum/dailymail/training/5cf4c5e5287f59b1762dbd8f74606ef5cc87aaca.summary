by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 2 may 2013 it took 12 firefighters three hours to decide how to rescue this lamb after it fell down a well in @entity5 - they used a ladder in the end a team of 12 firefighters rushed to a farm in three fire engines to rescue a lamb that had fallen down a well			1
emergency services sped to the scene at midday yesterday , and spent nearly three hours discussing their plan of action			0
eventually they came to a conclusion and at 3pm they finally used a crane to lower a ladder 32ft ( 10m ) down into the well so a lone fire officer could climb down and carry the lamb to the surface			2
the uninjured animal was then returned safely to its mother at @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity5 , and fire crews left the scene			1
the @entity32 and rescue operation is believed to have cost around £ 6,000 , based on the cost of having three tenders and a dozen men out for three hours			2
residents who gathered at the scene in the @entity5 countryside to watch the rescue operation were left questioning why it took so many firefighters to rescue one stranded lamb			2
student @entity44 , 21 , said : ' all it took was a ladder and one man to climb down there and back out again			0
' i sincerely hope it did n't keep them from attending any serious incidents that were going on elsewhere because it seemed a disproportionate reaction			0
' father - of - four @entity56 , 36 , added : ' firefighters do an amazing job but you really have to question why one lamb really needed three fire engines and a dozen men			1
' you could see them all standing there figuring out how best to approach the operation			0
i was thinking " just get on with it "			0
three fire engines and 12 firefighters rushed to the scene in the middle of the @entity5 countryside yesterday after three hours of deliberation , the firefighters lowered a ladder into the well and brought the lamb out ' all they did in the end is lower a ladder down and one bloke was down and back out in no time			1
it was hardly a major operation - i have seen fewer fire engines at actual fires			1
' a spokesperson for @entity85 said : ' the lamb was remarkably calm after its ordeal and seemed content as it was returned to its mother			1
' it is not known how the lamb got down there but seemed to be fine and ran off when placed back on firm ground			0
' fire brigades spent at least £ 3.5m in three years rescuing animals including a snail , a lost duckling and seven dolphins , according to figures released in 2011			0
the three - hour rescue operation had a happy ending , but at an estimated £ 6,000 cost to the taxpayer			2

three fire engines raced to scene and firemen put a ladder down the well
operation by @entity85 cost *thousands* of pounds
