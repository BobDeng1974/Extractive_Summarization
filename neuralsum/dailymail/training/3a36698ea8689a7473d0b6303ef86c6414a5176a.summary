@entity0 was late for the opening practice session of the @entity2 after he overslept			1
the @entity4 man , who leads the drivers ' standings after four consecutive wins , was forced to dash from his boat to the @entity4 motorhome after arriving at the @entity11 circuit just minutes before the start of friday 's first practice session			1
but @entity0 was soon in his @entity4 , ending the session marginally faster than team - mate and rival for the championship @entity18 , with @entity20 's @entity19 third quickest			1
on track : @entity0 ended the first practice session on top of the timesheets ahead of team - mate @entity18 in form : @entity4 man @entity0 has won the last four races , and leads @entity18 by three points @entity0 's poor time - keeping is arguably the first mistake of what has so far been an immaculate season			1
the 29 - year - old arrives in @entity11 leading @entity18 by three points in the race for the title , and he was back at the sharp end of the timesheets on friday , somewhat predictably followed by his team - mate			0
the top two may have been the same , but at least there was a whiff of a suggestion that the pair may not have it all their own way			0
five successive poles between the @entity4 duo , five straight wins and four consecutive one - twos have been the story of one of the most crushing starts to this or any other season			2
after @entity18 produced a clean sweep last year in topping the times at the end of all three practice sessions , qualifying and then taking the chequered flag , @entity0 managed to get his nose in front on this occasion by just 0.032secs			1
making a dash for it : @entity0 arrives on boat just moments before the start of friday 's opening session on the run : @entity0 sprints to the paddock after arriving on boat for the opening practice session in @entity70 picture that : @entity71 was sixth fastest in friday 's opening practice session champion : @entity74 was five tenths quicker than @entity71 in posting a time of one minute 18.271secs , @entity0 finished just over two seconds off @entity18 's best in @entity78 a year ago to underline the gap between last year 's @entity81 power and this season 's 1.6 - litre @entity83 turbo - chargers is slowly being reduced			1
behind them was @entity19 , with the @entity87 just 0.235secs adrift , offering a glimmer of hope of ending @entity4 ' run of results			2
with the tight , twisty nature of the track more appropriate for high downforce than outright power , with @entity4 having a stranglehold on the latter , the former may yet come to @entity20 's aid			2
there was a gap then , however , with @entity74 in his @entity101 0.659secs off the pace , followed by the second @entity20 of reigning four - times champion @entity103 , with the @entity105 0.772secs down			0
no other driver came within a second of @entity108 , with @entity101 's @entity71 the best of the rest in sixth and 1.196secs behind			0
@entity111 's @entity110 was down in 11th position , 1.762secs adrift , finishing two places and a quarter of a second behind team - mate @entity115			0
for his first outing around @entity70 , @entity118 's @entity117 rookie @entity116 was 18th and 2.643secs down			0
@entity121 's @entity120 , currently on a record run of 24 consecutive finishes since his f1 debut , managed just seven laps due to an early technical failure , leaving him at the bottom of the standings , 7.5secs back .			0

@entity0 forced to dash from his boat to the paddock after he overslept
the @entity4 driver still managed to post the best time ahead of @entity18
the @entity135 , who leads the championship , is bidding for his fifth straight win
@entity19 was third quickest in his @entity20
