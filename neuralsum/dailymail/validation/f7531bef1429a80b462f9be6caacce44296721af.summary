it was the match @entity1 needed to win to convince the many doubters that this qualifying campaign is not destined to end in failure			1
for regardless of substitute @entity7 ’s stoppage - time equaliser amid a frenzied finish , it was a performance and result which again raises more questions than answers			1
@entity1 will protest that the second - half display was better – it could not have been worse than their sorry first - half showing – but this was supposed to be the making of @entity16 at the @entity17 , a venue which is yet to produce any iconic nights for the boys in green			1
substitute @entity7 celebrates his 90th - minute strike which secured a crucial draw for the @entity24 in @entity25 @entity26 pounces on a mistake from @entity24 left back @entity28 to score the opener in @entity25 @entity26 races away to celebrate after his powerful left footed strike put @entity32 ahead in the 26th - minute the @entity32 forward is mobbed by his team - mates following his crucial goal at the @entity17 the celebrations continue on the sideline following @entity26 's first - half strike @entity24 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : given 5 ; @entity39 6 , @entity40 5.5 , @entity41 6 , @entity28 4 ; @entity42 5.5 , @entity43 6 ( long 83 ) , @entity44 6 , @entity45 5 ( @entity46 67 , 5 ) @entity47 6 ; @entity48 5.5 scorers : long 90 bookings : @entity47 , @entity51 , @entity39 , @entity41 , @entity44 @entity32 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity52 6 ; @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6 ; @entity26 7.5 ( @entity57 87 ) , @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 7 , @entity60 7 ; @entity61 6 ( @entity62 83 ) , @entity63 6 scorers : @entity26 26 bookings : @entity54 , @entity66 , @entity26 referee : @entity68 ( @entity69 ) man of the match : @entity26 the @entity73 standings following sunday night 's draw in @entity25 but therein lay part of the problem , for those in green were outnumbered by the partisan @entity79 , who celebrated @entity26 ’s first - half opener by firing scores of fluorescent red flares			1
thanks to @entity7 ’s late intervention , however , @entity24 ’s hopes of automatic qualification have not gone up in smoke , for now at least			1
but scrutiny of @entity1 and @entity48 ’s expensive tenure will intensify			2
they trail table toppers @entity32 by three points with world champions @entity94 and @entity96 two ahead			2
it is , you feel , now a shoot - out between @entity24 and the @entity100 – who meet here in june – for the third - placed play - off berth			2
‘ @entity96 now is very , very important			0
i think we will have to beat them			0
if the second - half showing is anything to go by then i think we ’re capable of doing that , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ this might just prove an important point			0
we are still in the competition			0
’ @entity32 's @entity59 tackles @entity24 and @entity112 forward @entity42 in the early stages of the contest @entity24 defender @entity41 ( left ) clashes with @entity32 's @entity116 @entity47 ( left ) and @entity32 midfielder @entity58 speak to referee @entity68 @entity1 admitted before the game that defeat would have ended their hopes of finishing in the top two places			1
@entity7 ’s last - gasp effort at least spared the manager that trauma , but his celebration of a ‘ terrific ’ second half which perhaps deserved more was misplaced			1
‘ we started off tentatively			0
we were a little bit nervous			0
we conceded a poor goal and that put us on the back foot , ’ he reflected			0
‘ but our second - half performance was terrific			2
we deserved at least a draw and we could easily have won it			2
‘ we got the momentum going and the crowd stayed with us			0
so overall i ’m pleased			0
‘ whatever we may lack , courage and spirit are not among them			0
it ’s no fluke we ’ve scored late goals in three games			0
’ veteran @entity24 striker @entity143 ( left ) takes on @entity32 defender @entity54 @entity32 fans light flares in the stands during their side 's clash with the @entity24 at the @entity17 in @entity25 @entity1 had named an attacking line - up – at least in terms of personnel – but a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 system did little to inspire an early offensive zeal			1
his decision to play winger @entity28 at left back was already looking like an error of judgment before the mistake which led to @entity32 ’s breakthrough on 26 minutes			1
surrendering possession on the fringe of his area , @entity28 could only watch in horror as @entity116 and @entity26 combined with the latter smashing beyond @entity165			2
@entity1 ’s response to an uninspiring half was to switch to 4 - 4 - 2 with @entity42 – wasted on the right - hand side of midfield – moved forward to partner captain @entity143			1
@entity24 assistant coach @entity48 watches on during his side 's @entity171 qualifier clash in @entity25 @entity24 and @entity173 right back @entity39 ( left ) shields the ball from @entity56 @entity24 midfielder @entity43 takes a big tumble after he collided with @entity61 they would have been level but for the width of a post when @entity28 ’s deflected centre spiralled above and beyond a panicked @entity52 and cracked the woodwork on 52 minutes			1
but it was the introduction of substitute @entity46 which sparked the revival			0
he burst down the left within moments of his arrival and landed a cross on the head of @entity48 whose cushioned nod bounced back off the post			0
@entity46 was again the provider for @entity39 but the right back lashed woefully wide from 14 yards as the hosts poured forward in search of parity			0
and they had to wait until the second minute of injury - time for @entity7 to pounce with a close - range poke when the ball dropped at his feet from @entity28 ’s corner			1
the goal may have stolen a point , but @entity1 and his team still have a point to prove .			2

@entity26 fired @entity32 into the lead in the 26th - minute with a powerful left footed strike
@entity1 's men improved *dramatically* in the second half
substitute @entity7 pounced in added time to secure a crucial draw for his side
