scored a deal : @entity1 is the latest in a long list of endorsement deals that @entity4 has inked executives at @entity1 are hoping to make @entity6 run on @entity1 ’ and using @entity4 to help by signing an endorsement deal with the basketball star			1
@entity9 said monday that @entity10 superstar @entity4 has agreed to promote @entity1 and @entity12 ice cream in @entity13 where the company has about a third of its stores			2
the company is hoping to cater to the eastern market by creating different savory products for the various countries			0
one example of a locally - inspired menu item would be pork donuts in @entity6 , and though they may not be palatable to @entity25 or @entity26 , it will certainly show the company 's understanding of the nation 's preferences , where it aims to open another 100 stores in the next two to three years			1
@entity4 will promote @entity1 's brands in @entity6 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 through advertisements , online media and in - store marketing , so he may well be testing out the new pork donuts while on promotional visits			1
' donuts are a very flexible product			2
you can do savory donuts , you can do donuts with shredded pork -- that 's in @entity6 , ' said ceo @entity48			1
' we also have a range of other savory products that we have been testing and introducing country by country			0
' getting the menu right in each market is critical			2
pork donuts , for example , are not likely to sell well in @entity58 and @entity59 , where people are predominantly @entity61			1
@entity62 will also make personal appearances in @entity13 after the season ends in june , which is sure to increase profits for the company as the 27 - year - old is very popular in the region			1
international appeal : at present , a third of the company 's stores are in @entity13 - like this store in @entity75 - and they are due to add 250 more in the next 2 - 3 years @entity1 ' executive @entity76 would not elaborate on the specific terms of the deal , but said it was multiyear and worth multimillions of dollars			1
‘ i 'm really excited about partnering with @entity9 and connecting with the huge community of basketball fans ’ in @entity13 , @entity4 said in a statement			2
@entity4 , a two - time @entity84 , has the best - selling basketball jersey and shoe in @entity6 and has visited @entity13 four times			1
this endorsement deal comes on top of a number of others that help @entity4 earn between $ 25million and $ 30million per year			0
open for business : seen here at a charity event sponsored by @entity95 - with whom @entity4 has an endorsement deal - the @entity10 star makes anywhere between $ 25m - $ 30m per year brand ambassador : @entity4 has long had a contract with @entity102 , and has nine signature shoes by the company fast food has been profitable for the player in the past , as he has a long - term contract with @entity108 already underway , as well as other food and drink deals with @entity95 , @entity111 and @entity112			2
there are over 10,000 @entity1 shops worldwide in 32 countries			0
this figure puts them in the same league - though still vastly outnumbered - as @entity119 which has 17,009 locations			0
the brand 's headquarters are in @entity123 , @entity124 , and unsurprisingly the chain is seen most frequently in the @entity126			0
in the home state alone there are 294 locations			0
moving west of the @entity132 , however , there are only 75 franchises			0
that number is sure to increase in the coming years as the company announced that it plans to triple its total size			0
a large amount of those locations are going to come in the @entity25 as it plans to have 15,000 stores by 2020			0
they also plan to expand outside of the @entity25 , with expected openings in the @entity142 , @entity34 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
but given their endorsement plans with @entity4 , it comes as no surprise that much of their attention will be focused on @entity13			1
the company plans to open 250 stores throughout the continent in the next two to three years , 100 of which will be in @entity6			1
@entity6 is the @entity10 's second - biggest market after the @entity25 , and @entity10 players often visit @entity13 on behalf of shoe companies or other sponsors during the offseason			1

‘ @entity4 has a strong commitment to building his relationship in @entity13 so he 's definitely planning multiple trips to @entity13 in the offseason this year			2
’ the popularity of basketball in @entity13 has grown during the last decade , in part because of former @entity186 center @entity185 of @entity6 , who retired last year			1
@entity188 guard @entity187 has become an overnight sensation in @entity13 , especially in @entity6 and @entity33			1
@entity187 , whose parents were born in @entity33 , is the first @entity13 - @entity25 player in the @entity10			1
mr @entity76 said @entity1 is happy to have snagged @entity4 , who has been an all - star for eight seasons			0
appealing to the @entity13 market : retired star @entity185 ( left ) and @entity195 phenomenon @entity187 ( center ) are big hits in @entity13 , but @entity4 ( right ) is extremely popular in the region as well @entity187 ‘ certainly is an exciting new player with 20 games to his history , ’ said mr @entity76 , who is @entity1 's chief global marketing and innovation officer			2
