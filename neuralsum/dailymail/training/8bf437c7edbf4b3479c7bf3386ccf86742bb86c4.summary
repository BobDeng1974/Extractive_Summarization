when it comes to golfing achievements , there ’s no better company to keep than @entity4 and sir @entity5 , and @entity6 found himself linked with both following his gutsy play - off success in the @entity9 event staged in @entity11 ’s capital on sunday			1
victory at the @entity13 was @entity15 ’s sixth triumph since 2010 on the hardest tour of all			1
the only man who has won more tournaments in @entity11 during that time frame is @entity4			1
also , @entity15 has now pulled up alongside sir @entity5 for the most titles claimed on @entity11 soil by an @entity24 since 1945			1
now it ’s back to the @entity26 for the @entity27 at @entity28 next week , followed by the @entity29 on home turf at @entity31			0
@entity15 raises his arms after winning the 18th - hole play - off at the @entity35 not for the first time , @entity15 will step on to the first tee at an @entity27 with a rising sense of expectation			1
it was like this last year , following his major breakthrough the previous month at the @entity43			2
it was the same in 2010 , when he arrived at @entity46 having achieved two victories in the space of a month			2
golfers , generally , do n’t react well when the spotlight is shining and there are a million distractions to cope with , and @entity15 duly missed the cut on both occasions			1
indeed , his best performance by a country mile in an @entity27 remains that unforgettable fourth - place finish he managed as a 17 - year - old amateur at @entity60 in 1998			1
if truth be told , that prodigious effort has hung like a millstone around his neck , a constant reminder that this was the tournament it was his destiny to win			0
now , practically half of his lifetime later and a few miles south along the same patch of glorious golfing coastline , there ’s every reason to believe the hype will be matched with deed and @entity15 , 34 at the end of this month , can finally contend down the stretch once more			1
@entity15 has now won six tournaments on the @entity82 since 2010 on sunday he showed his most overlooked quality which is just how deep he can dig. a tournament he had dominated towards the close of the final afternoon was in danger of running away from him when his bad shot , a hook from the tee , made an unwelcome appearance under pressure			1
it says much about a man when the two longest putts he holes all day come in the most stressful of circumstances			0
one at the 17th rescued a par while the 18 - footer for a bogey at the 18th , holed amid the brain - scrambling consequences of a foolish approach that looked to have cost him the title , must be among the best he has made			2
the subsequent play - off against the game @entity11 @entity111 saw a recent major winner against a man who has never won on tour — and it showed			1
@entity15 played his best golf when the conditions became firm and fast over the weekend and that ’s certainly how it looks like @entity120 will be playing			1
the last time it was staged there , in 2006 , he was watching on television			0
it was during one of those slumps that have punctuated his rollercoaster career and given him the inner strength we saw again on sunday			0
tied 14th at @entity130 and tied 12th at the @entity131 , @entity15 offers real cause for the home nation at the @entity29 to believe			2
‘ i ’m very excited about getting back to @entity120			0
i ’m excited to play that course			2
i do n’t know how it ’s changed since we played it in 2006			0
it has been a bone dry winter in @entity24			0
’ ok , so the terrible winter floods were not big news in the @entity4 household			0
but we certainly welcome the rest of this comment from the 14 - time major winner , do n’t we ? against the odds it really looks like the main man will be at @entity31 in a fortnight			2
and yes … we ’re excited too , @entity4			0
comeback : @entity4 hits out of the rough during the second round of the @entity13 journeyman @entity150 a winner at last away from the glitz and glamour of the @entity9 came welcome news from the subsidiary circuit , the @entity156 , where 42 - year - old @entity24 @entity150 was making his 249th start in @entity11 since leaving these shores and going west in 2006			1
he has mustered a clutch of top 10s , including three runner - up finishes — most notably in the 2006 @entity161 , where he heartbreakingly three - putted from five feet at the 17th			2
he carved out a nice living for himself and his family , with around £ 4.5million in earnings			0
the thing that was always missing was a victory			0
but @entity150 broke his duck at the @entity170 , going eagle - birdie - birdie from the 15th to win by one			0
it was his first win anywhere since the @entity173 in 2003 , and gives him every chance of reclaiming full privileges for the main circuit next year			0
the £ 65,000 first prize was a fraction of that won by @entity15 , but the elation @entity150 felt was surely the same .			1

@entity6 won the @entity13 in a play - off
@entity15 has now won six tournaments in the @entity11 since 2010
the *33* - year - old has won as many tournaments on @entity11 soil as @entity5
