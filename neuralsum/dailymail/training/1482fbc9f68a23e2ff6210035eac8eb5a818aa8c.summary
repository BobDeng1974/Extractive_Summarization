@entity1 's population is growing at more than twice the @entity3 average			1
the number living in the @entity1 soared by 400,000 last year – almost a third of the increase across all 27 @entity8 countries			1
the rise is underpinned by high levels of migration and a baby boom itself brought about mainly by immigrants			0
overcrowded ? @entity1 will have the highest population in @entity3 within 40 years , according to projections made by @entity17 , the @entity8 statistics agency the figures from @entity17 , the statistical arm of the @entity8 , are further evidence that @entity21 is becoming the most crowded country in @entity3			1
projections show that @entity1 will have the highest population on the continent within 40 years , overtaking both @entity25 and @entity26			1
@entity17 said the @entity1 's population growth of 409,000 in 2010 amounted to 30 per cent of the 1.4million added to numbers across the whole @entity8			1
the only other country to experience a population increase of more than 300,000 was @entity26			2
@entity1 's population went up at a rate of 6.6 new people for every 1,000 already in the country , well over double the @entity8 average rate of 2.8 for every 1,000			1
only two countries – @entity38 and @entity39 – and the tiny nations of @entity41 and @entity42 saw higher rates of increase			0
baby boom : around one in four babies is born to a mother born outside the @entity1			1
picture posed by model the figures will fuel concerns over the provision of housing and public services in crowded areas			0
transport , schools , water and energy supplies are all in increasing demand as the @entity1 population heads toward the landmark figure of 70million , which is expected to be reached in 25 years time			1
the @entity8 analysis reflects the findings of @entity66 officials in attributing two fifths of the population increase to immigration and three fifths to ' natural change ' – the difference between numbers of babies born and the national death toll			0
however a substantial share of the baby boom , which is producing birthrates which match the historic highs in the two decades after the @entity80 , is largely a result of high migration			0
around one in four babies is born to a mother who was born outside @entity1			2
sir @entity84 of the @entity85 think tank , said : ' this is a result of @entity89 's immigration policies which brought in three million migrants , raising our population both directly and indirectly			2
' many of the additional births over the past ten years have been to mothers born outside the @entity1			1
' a report yesterday revealed that @entity1 migrants from one @entity99 country are much more heavily dependent on the state to provide them with homes than people from any other minority group			2
eight out of ten @entity104 were found to live in homes provided by the taxpayer			0
yet among every other immigrant nationality , more than half pay for their own housing either by renting it on the private market or through buying their homes			0
the findings come from the @entity115 and were revealed yesterday in a report by @entity85			0
if the @entity115 figures – calculated from official statistics – are correct , then the provision of homes for @entity104 is likely have cost taxpayers more than £ 2billion			0
@entity66 officials estimate there are 150,000 @entity104 in @entity1 , most of whom fled civil war and lawlessness that broke out in 1991			2
there has been outrage over @entity104 refugee @entity130 , who moved with his family into a £ 2m house in @entity133 , at a cost to the public of £ 8,000 a month .			0

@entity1 set for @entity3 's highest population in 40 years
population growth accounts for 30 *%* of @entity3 total
rate of growth is double @entity3 average
