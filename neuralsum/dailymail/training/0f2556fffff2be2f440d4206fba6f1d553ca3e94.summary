' @entity162 's lawyers are arguing that he was pushed over the edge by @entity14 's unwelcome advances			1

the defence says @entity63 came from a violent and troubled home , was pushed to the edge after @entity14 made too many unwelcome advances and is only guilty of manslaughter			2

' @entity228 , who had befriended @entity14 and gave him a green homecoming dress in the month before he was killed , said she no longer works at the school , and that she was forced to quit			2
' i would n't want to go back to the school where they treat students and me like that , ' said she said she never asked anyone 's permission to give @entity14 her daughter 's used homecoming dress , because he had started wearing makeup and his guardians seemed ok with the change			2
' it seemed like the foster care he was in was not condoning it per se but at least allowing him to finally do what he wanted to do instead of fighting him on it , ' she said			0
according to court documents , as the boys sat in a computer lab , @entity63 drew a .22 - caliber gun from his sweatshirt and shot @entity14 in the back of the head			1
