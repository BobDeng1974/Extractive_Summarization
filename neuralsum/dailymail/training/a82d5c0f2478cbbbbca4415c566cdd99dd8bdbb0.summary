curator of the museum , @entity110 , said : ' the rebuild was entirely funded by ourselves and it was the lack of money or any grants towards the reconstruction which had meant that so much time had elapsed since we took it down			0
' the delay in final completion is due to having run out of funds for the project			0
' this does not unduly worry me as the lovely new roof and gutters are on , so it is coming to no harm			0
' it still needs plastering in the nave , flagstone floors throughout , doors and windows , which will be made by our own joiners , and @entity46 box pews installing , once we find some			0
' all the original woodwork was of course destroyed in the fire			2
the last parochial service at the church was held in 1962 but there are hopes one might be held again in the future ' outside we need to do a lot of landscaping ; more flags , the church yard wall and a ' @entity148 ' to house our 19th century hearse , which i believe to be the oldest anywhere			0
' the uncertainty of raising the money means that at present we are unable to set a date for public opening , although all visitors to the museum can at least view the outside of the building now			0
