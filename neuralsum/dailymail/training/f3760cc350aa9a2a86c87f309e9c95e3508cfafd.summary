@entity0 returned to his native @entity1 anxious not to offend @entity2 - the club who gave him his big break - but the biggest compliment he could lavish upon them was to confirm his plan to start with @entity8 up front			1
@entity8 's participation is ever shrouded in doubt as he nurses tight hamstrings but with @entity13 left behind in @entity14 with an ankle injury @entity0 has decided to risk his eight - goal striker rather than play @entity17 at centre - forward			1
' in this moment , if @entity8 can play , i play @entity8 , ' said the @entity21 boss			1
' the team had a pre-season with him			0
the team worked with him a lot of times			0
he 's playing with us every match in the @entity30			1
so the team at this moment is more made to play with @entity8			1
@entity0 confirmed that @entity8 will start @entity34 tie on tuesday @entity21 striker @entity8 was in high spirits during training on monday ' i think @entity17 is learning how to play with us			1
his pace is good , his movement is good , he can get behind defenders , he 's not bad in the air			1
he has some similarities with @entity8 and if he has to play , no problem			1
but i prefer to play @entity8			1
' there is a risk , yes			2
but we assume the risk and he plays			2
i do n't rest people			0
i do n't think about @entity51 on sunday			0
i 'm going to start with the team i think is the best team			0
' it is a clue to how pivotal @entity0 suspects this game may be			1
all the teams in @entity58 go into the second game with one point and one goal			1
a win in the @entity63 will put @entity21 in control before back - to - back games against @entity66 of @entity67 , the team expected to be the weakest in the group			2
@entity8 's participation is ever shrouded in doubt as he nurses tight hamstrings @entity0 prefers to play @entity8 instead of starting new signing @entity17 as centre forward @entity75 and @entity0 at a press conference in @entity77 , @entity1 on monday there is also the emotion of a return to the club where it all started for him in 1992 , when sir @entity84 invited him onto his backroom staff			1
asked how it felt to return all these years later as one of the finest managers of his generation , he replied : ' pride ; a sense of pride			0
i was all i could be at this club			0
i tried to help the team the best way i could , at the beginning of my career			0
' in an interview yesterday with the @entity1 newspaper record he described his first role at @entity2 as ' the do - it - all - boy '			2
he was born and raised in @entity107 , 20 miles south of @entity77 , where there is now a street named in his honour			0
@entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 will be on @entity21 's radar when they step out in @entity77 this year 's @entity34 involves six coaches from @entity1 , more than any other country			1
they are @entity0 , @entity2 boss @entity118 , @entity119 now at @entity120 , @entity121 of @entity122 and @entity123 at @entity124			1
for the younger generation , @entity0 is a mould - breaker ; the one who gave them the confidence to take what they knew to bigger football nations			1
' he is the master of leadership and motivation , he is the @entity135 , ' said 37 - year - old @entity118 , last night , aware that facing @entity21 would be the biggest test of his young coaching career			2
@entity0 talks to @entity138 as they prepare for @entity34 tie in @entity77 @entity0 after all is plotting a third @entity34 win with a third different club and his team are unbeaten this season			1
his last game in @entity1 was with @entity21 against @entity146 in february 2007			2
' i 'm not expecting to be received with special affection , ' said @entity0			1
' i did nothing for @entity2			0
i limited myself to my insignificance			0
but i did n't do anything important to justify being received with particular hostility , and i 've never stopped showing the utmost respect for @entity2 and pride that a small part of my career was conducted there			0
let it be the way people think it should be			0
' the only bad memory i have of my time here is when i left			0
there is no grudge , no sense of ill - feeling			2
it 's been a long time since i faced a @entity1 team , and it is a great joy to return			2
this will be a match like all others in terms of emotion			0
if i could choose , ultimately , the outcome of this group , i would place @entity135 and @entity175			0
' @entity13 is expected to be out for at least two weeks with his ankle injury			0
@entity177 is also absent with a groin problem .			0
