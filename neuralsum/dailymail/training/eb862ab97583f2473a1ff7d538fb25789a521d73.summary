by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 03:52 est , 18 april 2013 until yesterday , @entity3 ’s tousle - haired companion ’s only regular exposure to @entity5 politics was confined to the annual parliamentary skiing competition in @entity7			2
@entity8 , 43 , is a leading ski instructor in the @entity11 resort and regularly puts @entity5 mps through their paces before the contest with their @entity11 counterparts			1
his place in the @entity18 line - up was a surprise even to some of @entity22 ’s closest friends			0
a daughter 's grief : @entity3 is comforted by partner @entity8 and her brother @entity26 's wife , @entity25 , at @entity27 after yesterday 's funeral rarely seen in @entity5 , let alone photographed with @entity3 , he has studiously avoided any publicity since the pair met on the @entity32 slopes in 1992			1
he has been a constant and discreet companion ever since , though the exact nature of their relationship is ambiguous			0
they were certainly a romantic item initially			0
yet @entity3 , who at 59 is 16 years his senior , said on one of the few occasions she has talked publicly about @entity8 : ‘ one day i ’m sure he will vanish into the distance with someone younger and prettier			1
’ two years ago , @entity8 broke both his legs in a skiing accident , and @entity3 nursed him back to health			1
yesterday , however , as @entity3 emerged hesitantly from the official car outside @entity49 ’s , it was easy to see that it was his moment to support her			0
her rock : @entity3 - never close to her twin brother - with long - time partner @entity8 , who also appeared visibly moved support : although @entity8 , 43 , is rarely seen in @entity5 , let alone photographed with @entity3 , yesterday he was constantly by her side during the funeral close together : @entity3 stayed by her man 's side after the service as they waited for the hearse to take @entity22 's coffin away as she walked up the aisle of the cathedral , @entity3 looked distracted and tense and repeatedly darted her head in @entity8 ’s direction for reassurance			1
in contrast , only once — and then just briefly as they earlier walked up the cathedral steps — was there physical contact between @entity3 and her twin brother , @entity26			0
he touched her arm just at the moment her face crumpled with emotion			0
sitting in the front row pew , she constantly clasped and unclasped her hands , crossed her legs over each other and back again , fanned herself with her order of service and re-arranged her hat			0
she showed all the outwards signs of inner unease			0
on the cathedral steps after the service , as they waited for the hearse to take away their mother ’s coffin , @entity3 and her brother stood apart , almost symbolically , in the family group — separated by their respective partners			2
strong together : @entity3 leans on her partner of 21 years , @entity8 , at @entity94 , central @entity95 @entity8 stood by @entity96 outside @entity94 nest to sir @entity26 , his wife @entity25 , and his two children @entity99 and @entity101 for years , the twins were barely on speaking terms			1
@entity3 was always closer to her father , sir @entity104 , who died in 2003 , while @entity26 was always his mother ’s favourite			1
‘ they rarely see each other but put on a good show when they are on public parade , ’ said a friend of @entity3			0
‘ the truth is that there is little between them			0
‘ @entity3 would have felt very isolated without @entity8			1
in fact , i do n’t think she could have got through the service without him			0
’ when they first became an item , @entity8 , whose family were hoteliers , lived in @entity3 ’s riverside apartment in @entity123 , @entity95 , and she referred to him as her ‘ lodger ’			1
he soon became an occasional guest at her parents ’ house in @entity128 , @entity129			0
mischievously , @entity8 would ask @entity22 if she thought @entity11 should join the @entity130 , knowing that it would trigger one of her famous political diatribes on the subject of @entity135			1
a hug for @entity137 : @entity138 puts a reassuring arm around a distressed sir @entity26 while her brother wipes away a tear and her stepmother looks on concerned he also got on well with sir @entity104 , who advised him to emulate his example : stay out of the limelight and never give interviews			1
@entity8 followed that advice to the letter			2
indeed , until the funeral , only a handful of @entity3 ’s friends knew what he even looked like			2
@entity22 would have been pleased that @entity8 was at @entity49 ’s because she knew that he made @entity3 happy and that he has never embarrassed her family			2
sir @entity104 would also have approved , as @entity8 is a consummate party host back in @entity7 , where he and @entity3 own a small , stylish apartment			1
@entity3 divides her time between the @entity11 resort and an apartment in @entity156 , where she is learning @entity157			2
her flight home to @entity11 would also have earned the approval of the famously thrifty @entity160			0
@entity3 and @entity8 will leave as they arrived in @entity5 — on an @entity163 budget flight .			2

@entity3 's partner supported her at her mother 's funeral today
@entity8 , 43 , met ms @entity3 in 1992 and the pair live in @entity11
grass is *notoriously* publicity *shy* after taking advice from sir @entity104
