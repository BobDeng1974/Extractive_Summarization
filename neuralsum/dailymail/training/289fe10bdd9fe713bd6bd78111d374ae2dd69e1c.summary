by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 7 june 2012 updated : 05:18 est , 8 june 2012 this is the one - year - old girl who can only eat fish fingers - because her mystery illness means almost anything else could kill her			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , is severely allergic to grass , pollen , animal fur , polyester , plastic , cosmetics , chemicals and even sunlight			1
almost any food can trigger a life - threatening reaction , so the 20 - month - old child 's mother @entity19 sustains the sensitive girl on an unchanging diet of gluten - free fish fingers			2
finger food : @entity7 survives on an unchanging diet of gluten - free fish fingers - because she could have a life - threatening reaction , right , if she eats anything else highly sensitive : coming into contact with grass , pollen , sunlight or almost any food can cause her to break out in an itchy , painful rash upsetting problem : as a baby , @entity7 struggled to keep her milk down and her distraught mother was even accused of making her daughter sick doctors believe the problem is down to an underlying condition - but as yet they have no idea what that could be			1
until @entity7 's illness is diagnosed , her mother @entity19 has to be constantly on the alert for a potentially fatal reaction			1
if @entity7 eats or comes into contact with something she is allergic to , her skin erupts in painful , itchy sores and she is often violently sick			1
last year , the toddler 's family gave her some tuna - which she had always been able to eat before			2
the youngster immediately went into anaphylactic shock , her throat swelling up and cutting off her oxygen supply			2
her terrified mother rushed her to hospital , where doctors were fortunately able to save her life			2
had she got there any later , @entity7 might not be alive today			1
mrs @entity7 , 30 , said : ' it was a really scary day			1
i could have lost her			2
protective : @entity67 and @entity19 and four - year - old sister @entity68 are constantly on the alert in case the toddler goes into anaphylactic shock pulling through : it has been a difficult journey for @entity7 and mother @entity19 , who works part - time as a carer in between looking after her little girl ' some children can build up tolerance to foods but the more exposure @entity7 has , the worse her reactions get			1
' i always keep fish fingers in the freezer			0
' her diet does worry me			0
i have to give her multi-vitamins and calcium supplements			0
' as a baby , @entity7 struggled to keep her milk down and her distraught mother was even accused of making her daughter sick			1
it was only as she got older that doctors realised the extent of her allergies			2
mrs @entity7 and husband @entity97 , 35 , have now spent all their savings on buying an uncontaminated new house and spent three months researching before they bought any furniture			1
they have also invested around Â£ 5,000 in special allergy - free carpets and even grass			2
unlike other toddlers , @entity7 can not go to nursery , because it would be too dangerous , and she will have to be home - schooled when she is older			1
cared for : the 20 - month - old 's family ensure she takes multivitamins and is covered up when she goes out in the sun - which she can only do for a few minutes at a time if she does go out , she has to be protected from the sun and can only spend a few minutes at a time outdoors			2
@entity7 's hyper - sensitivity , although rare , is not completely unheard of			1
a 19 - month - old was recently diagnosed with rare disorder eosinophilic colitis , which meant he could not eat anything but chips			2
@entity121 's family found that meat , fruit and any vegetables except potatoes left the toddler writhing in agony because too many white blood cells were being produced in his intestine			0
@entity7 's mother , who has set up a support group for parents of children with severe allergies , admits she sometimes finds it difficult to cope			1
she works part - time as a carer in between caring for @entity7 and eldest daughter @entity68 , four			1
she said : ' i would love nothing more than to watch her enjoy food and not be restricted			0
distressing : @entity7 's parents have bought a new house and furnished it with carefully chosen furniture and non-allergic carpet ' we do n't eat in front of @entity7			1
it would n't be fair because she 's too young to understand			0
' i have to watch her 24 hours a day			0
' a few months ago , i was out shopping and @entity7 was sat in the seat in the trolley			1
a man playfully touched her cheeks , like you would with any little baby			0
' she had a rash around her face , she was wheezing and her lips swelled			0
' it was only later i realised the man 's hands were covered in paint			0
he must have been painting his house and the chemicals caused her to have a reaction			0
' we went to a soft play centre and had only been there an hour when she started screaming			0
she was hysterical and i could n't calm her down			0
' she was covered head to toe in a red rash			0
' the little girl can not go to nursery , because it is too dangerous , and will have to be home - schooled later on medics have been left baffled by @entity7 's allergies although experts believe she could be suffering from a rare condition			1
@entity19 , who wants to train to become a dietician to better understand her daughter 's allergies , is hoping to be a referred to a specialist in @entity184 to get a diagnosis			0
for now , she must keep her daughter on a restricted diet			0
very occasionally , @entity7 can eat small amounts of fruit , vegetables and gluten - free cereal bars but her body can not tolerate these on a regular basis			1
despite her debilitating allergies , mrs @entity7 says @entity7 is still a happy little girl			1
' she likes playing with her sister and drawing , ' said her mother			0
' we just have to be careful she does n't eat the crayons			0
join the spud club : @entity121 , pictured with mother @entity201 , is also allergic to almost every food - but his case the exception is chips ' @entity7 has to experience things so i try to balance everything			1
i try to give her a bit of normality in her life			0
' @entity212 , deputy chief executive officer of @entity213 , said : ' true food allergies are rare , affecting up to eight per cent of children in the @entity216			0
' sufferers can react to even the tiniest amount of the trigger food , making life extremely difficult for parents of highly allergic children			2
' the most severe form of food allergy , anaphylaxis , can cause swelling of the lips , tongue or face , shortness of breath , throat constriction , breathing difficulties and loss of consciousness and can be life threatening			0
