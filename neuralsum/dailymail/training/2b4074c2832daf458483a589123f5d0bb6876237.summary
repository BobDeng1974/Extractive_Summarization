by @entity0 published : 02:29 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 2 may 2013 many commuters may be fed up with over-crowding on the railways , but there are some stations which serve a just handful of passengers each year			1
new figures have revealed a number of ' ghost ' stations which receive fewer than 100 travellers a year - with the least - used facility serving just 14 last year			1
these practically redundant stations are apparently kept open by the rail companies solely so they can avoid the bureaucracy it would take to officially close them			1
deserted : @entity20 railway station is @entity22 's least - used with just 14 passengers last year overkill : @entity24 , which served 16 passengers , is one of three stations in the town of 17,000 data released yesterday by the @entity30 rank every station in the country by how many passengers pass through each year			1
the least - used station of all was @entity20 , near @entity35 , which was visited by just 14 passengers in the 2011 - 12 financial year			1
the station 's unpopularity is due to the fact that it receives just one train per week , and is linked to an airport with just two regular scheduled flights			1
@entity43 is @entity24 in @entity44 , where 16 passengers got on or off a train last year			1
although trains stop at the station every two hours , it is crippled by being one of three stations in a town of just 17,000 inhabitants			2
campaign : activists argue that @entity54 in @entity55 , where 30 passengers got on or off a train last year , deserves a more frequent service underused : @entity59 is on the same line as @entity54 , receiving just one train a week with no return service , and welcomed 56 passengers last year 1			1
@entity20 , @entity64 - 14 passengers 2			1
@entity24 , @entity44 - 16 passengers 3			2
@entity54 , @entity55 - 30 passengers 4			2
@entity59 , @entity55 - 56 passengers 5			2
@entity69 , @entity70 - 60 passengers 6			0
@entity73 , @entity74 - 72 passengers 7			0
@entity75 , @entity76 - 86 passengers 8			0
@entity78 , @entity79 - 90 passengers 9			0
@entity81 , @entity82 - 100 passengers 10			1
@entity84 , @entity85 - 120 passengers @entity54 , in @entity55 , is at the centre of a campaign aiming to increase its number of passengers from the 30 it received in 2011 - 12			1
activists argue that the only reason the station can not attract more people is that it receives just one train a week , heading to @entity97 , while there is no service which goes in the opposite direction			2
@entity101 , chairman of the friends of @entity54 , suggested that the figures were misleading and blamed railway officials for the station 's neglect			0
' i 'm sure that if there were more trains people would use them , ' he told the @entity112			0
' this is a valued service and we are trying to get a regular service			0
' but @entity116 said the only reason it kept the station open was to fulfil the terms of its franchise agreement			0
a total of eight stations had passenger numbers in double figures , including @entity59 , @entity69 and @entity75			0
by way of comparison , the busiest station in 2011 - 12 was @entity127 , where 94,045,510 passed through			1
all of the top seven busiest were in @entity127 , with @entity128 and @entity129 taking second and third place			0
the highest - placed stations outside the capital were @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			0
scandal : stations like @entity138 , which served 60 people last year , are kept open for bureaucratic reasons contrast : the busiest station in @entity22 last year was @entity127 , with nearly 100million passengers the neglect of so many of @entity22 's smaller stations underlines how many areas are under - served by the railway network despite having their own facilities for trains			1
it is easier for train operating countries to run ' zombie ' services on lines they no longer wish to serve properly , as closing stations requires a lengthy consultation process			2
the 50th anniversary of the @entity160 cuts which closed more than 2,000 stations fell earlier this year			0
the controversial move meant many smaller towns were left with a station , and many services were re-routed to pass through @entity127 and other population hubs			0
but the latest figures on unused stations show that even some communities which were spared the axe do not have an effectively functioning railway .			0

@entity20 station received just 14 passengers in 2011 - 12
seven other stations in @entity22 had fewer than 100 passengers last year
train companies run just one train a week in some areas to avoid *hassle* of having to close stations officially
