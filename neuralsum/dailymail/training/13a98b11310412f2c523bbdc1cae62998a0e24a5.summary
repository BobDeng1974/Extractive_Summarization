by @entity0 published : 17:07 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 03:42 est , 5 december 2013 the terrible toll of the baby - boomer generation ’s drinking habits was laid bare today			2
official figures showed alcohol - related hospital admissions among those aged 45 and over have more than doubled in the past decade			1
among those in their 60s , admissions have almost tripled			2
figures released by the government 's @entity11 reveal alcohol - related admissions for those of the age of 45 have doubled in the last decade			1
file picture the increase is much lower among young adults , indicating that liver disease and alcoholism are much bigger problems among the middle - aged than previously thought			1
data from the government ’s @entity11 shows that in 2012/13 , a total of 26,209 men and 12,461 women aged 45 to 49 ended up in hospital purely due to alcohol			1
this was the highest total for any five - year age group			1
but the statistics reveal that the greatest increase in hospital treatment for alcohol problems over the past decade was among those in their 60s			1
during that period there was a 178 per cent rise in admissions of men aged 65 to 69 and a 177 per cent increase in admissions for women aged 60 to 64			2
admissions more than doubled for every age group over 45			1
experts said this was the cumulative effect of life - long drinking by the baby - boomer generation who felt liberated from societal constraints in the 1960s and 1970s			2
but they added that many older people are drinking too much now			0
in contrast , the smallest rises among adults in the past ten years were seen among those in their 30s – perhaps because this is the age at which many people settle down and have children			2
@entity66 , of charity @entity67 , said : ‘ too many of us of all ages are drinking too much too often and risking our health because of it			0
‘ it ’s easy to think that this is just a problem for binge - drinking youngsters but @entity67 ’s harm map shows that it ’s the middle - aged , and often middle - class drinkers , regularly drinking above recommended limits , who are actually requiring complex and expensive @entity82 care			1
' we have to wake up to the scale of the problem across the whole of society if we ’re to reverse these frightening statistics			0
’ @entity88 , of the @entity89 think tank , said : ' there is often a focus on binge drinking amongst the young but these figures show that older people need to take a look at their drinking ' @entity88 , of the @entity89 think tank , said : ‘ there is often a focus on binge drinking amongst the young but these figures show that older people need to take a look at their drinking			2
middle - aged , middle - class drinkers are drinking much more than they realise			1
‘ they are drinking more frequently , they are drinking stronger alcohol and they are using it as a common antidote for stress			0
alcohol has also become much cheaper in real terms			0
’ she added : ‘ we have become ever more rebellious in recent decades and it makes me wonder whether there has been a significant culture shift away from taking responsibility and behaving like a grown - up			0
’ the figures show there has also been a significant surge in alcohol - related hospital admissions among women in their 20s			1
in the past ten years , there was a 111 per cent increase in admissions for women aged 20 to 24 , and a 124 per cent rise among those aged 25 to 29			1
more than 10,600 women in their 20s were admitted for alcohol problems in 2012/13			0
the figures are likely to spark fresh fears of a rising ‘ ladette culture ’			0
though there was an increase among men in their 20s it was not as stark – just over 80 per cent			0
worryingly , there was a 36 per cent rise in alcohol - related hospital cases among girls aged 15 to 19 and an 8 per cent rise for boys			1
but the number of admissions for youngsters aged 14 and under has fallen			2
separate analysis shows that since 1970 , deaths from liver disease have risen five-fold among the under - 65s			0
mortality from every other major disease has fallen			0
dr @entity156 , a liver specialist at the @entity158 , said : ‘ what we are seeing is really dramatic and absolutely tragic			0
‘ @entity162 ’s relationship with alcohol has changed fundamentally in the past few decades … and this is the impact of it			0

figures from the @entity11 show alcohol - related admissions for the over- *45s* have doubled in a decade
greatest increase in admissions in the last 10 years is among the over 60s
surge in young women being taken to hospital for alcohol - related illnesses
admissions for the under - 14 age group has fallen
experts warn middle - aged , middle classes are drinking too much
