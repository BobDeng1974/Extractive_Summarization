by @entity0 published : 20:35 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 20:35 est , 10 march 2014 when archaeologists investigated two 7,000 - year - old corpses unearthed in @entity5 in 2006 , they made two startling discoveries			0
one of the two @entity8 hunter - gatherers had carried @entity10 and @entity11 genes , which meant he had dark skin and blue eyes			0
but there was an even more amazing revelation from the scientists when they announced the results of their research last month			0
the man 's genes also showed he was lactose intolerant			1
this is a condition in which the body has difficulty in absorbing the sugar that is commonly found in milk			1
for 3m people in the @entity31 a glass of cow juice is about as welcome as being force - fed cod liver oil a problem drinking milk ? what sort of hunter - gatherer was this ? surely food intolerances are a bit modern and namby - pamby ? well , i can identify strongly with this @entity8 milk dodger , as i too suffer from lactose intolerance			1
i 'm one of the estimated three million people in the @entity31 for whom a glass of cow juice is about as welcome as being force - fed cod liver oil			1
much to my regret , i only discovered that i had the condition last year , when i was going on a punitive three - day hike through the @entity49 with a good friend			0
at one point , as we were puffing up a particularly strenuous climb , he turned to me and observed , ' you do realise that you burp all the time ? ' at first , i was in denial			0
surely everybody burps a lot ? maybe i was just bad at hiding it			0
but by the time we reached the peak , i started to wonder - not least for the sake of my friendship - whether i did have something wrong with me			0
what happened next was like something out of a film , albeit one that goes straight to video			0
on a distant dale , i saw some cows			0
there they were , munching away , and the sight of them suddenly made me realise : of course , it was milk			1
until then , i had dismissed people who claim to have intolerances as being vain and self - important			0
i 'm not talking about those with allergies , which are clearly serious , and can be life - threatening			0
i 'm referring to those annoying people who carp on about being intolerant to this and that , when they are in fact just fussy eaters			1
a genetic mutation in the majority of the population means the ability to drink milk can be enjoyed for years but it was time to confront my prejudices			1
i was going to give up milk			1
no more breakfast cereal , no more milk in my tea and coffee			1
the idea of giving up my cherished daily bowl of @entity100 seemed appalling , but i had to give it a try			0
within about two days , my belching had almost vanished			0
there was no more effervescence , my guts no longer painfully bloated with gas			0
there was no doubt that milk was the culprit			1
i had cracked it , although i did curse that i had not kicked the milk churn decades before			1
all those years of subjecting friends and family to constant burping , all that discomfort needlessly endured , and all because i had n't tolerated those with intolerances			1
initially , i kept quiet about the whole business , as i did n't want to be a dietary bore			0
and then i came across the startling fact that 75 per cent of the world has some degree of lactose intolerance			1
it was another cow - on - a - distant - dale moment			0
@entity129 on , i thought , you people who can drink milk , it 's you who are the weird ones ! not me , i 'm the normal one			1
as it turns out , the ability to tolerate lactose is really only found in people in northern @entity11 , @entity139 and in pockets in the @entity141 and western and southern @entity10			1
if you go anywhere else , you 'll find that everybody is like me and @entity144			0
why is this ? the answer lies in the enzyme lactase , which breaks down the lactose in milk			1
although all of us are born with lactase , after about the age of two , the levels in our small intestines diminish rapidly for most people , which makes it hard for lactose to be broken down , and therefore causes discomfort , which is often manifested by burping			1
but in countries such as the @entity31 , a genetic mutation in the majority of the population means that lactase persists , and therefore the ability to drink milk can be enjoyed for many decades after infancy			1
last month , @entity31 scientists who have studied the residue in cooking pots from archaeological digs estimated that this mutation may have taken place 6,000 years ago			1
opinion is divided as to why this mutation which allows some of us to drink milk took place			1
some suggest that when our ancestors started to consume dairy produce , they built up a tolerance which altered their genes			0
others think that the mutation happened before mammalian milk was drunk , and it allowed dairy consumption to take place			1
the amount of lactose adults with intolerance can cope with in a day			1
it 's equivalent to a glass of milk but for people like me , it does n't really matter what came first			1
i want to know the health implications			0
after all , it 's drummed into us from an early age that milk is an essential part of our diet , chiefly because all that calcium is good for our bones			2
' there are no serious health consequences of being lactose intolerant , ' says professor @entity210 , a gastroenterologist at the @entity211 , ' and you should remember that for much of the world it 's quite normal			1
there 's no increased risk of any diseases			0
' you should also remember milk does not have a monopoly on calcium , which is found in broccoli , cabbage , soya beans and nuts			2
and just because you are lactose intolerant , it does not mean you have to give up cheese , as the fermentation process significantly reduces lactose levels			1
although professor @entity210 confirms that my self - diagnosis is perfectly valid and safe , there are more medically rigorous tests you can take should you suspect lactose intolerance			2
' potentially , you can submit to a whole series of investigations , ' says professor @entity210			0
' but the most simple and least invasive is the hydrogen breath test , in which the level of hydrogen in your breath is measured after you have drunk some lactose solution			2
' the test is done at a hospital and you need a gp referral			0
hydrogen is one of the gases so charmingly emitted by the likes of me after drinking milk - bacteria in the gut produce hydrogen in reaction to unabsorbed food , and if your levels of hydrogen are 20 parts per million higher after drinking the lactose solution , then you 're lactose intolerant			1
in my experience , that figure seems low			0
at times , i could have sworn i was expelling pure @entity268 common test is to measure the levels of glucose in your blood after drinking lactose			2
the lactase enzyme breaks down lactose into glucose - so if your glucose either rises slowly , or not at all after drinking lactose , it 's a sign of lactose intolerance			2
@entity0 has enough lactase in his small intestine to be able to cope with milk in tea again , this hospital test needs a referral from your gp			2
although professor @entity210 's words are reassuring , for some , a lactose intolerance can actually be a symptom of something more serious			2
a deficiency of lactase can be caused by inflammatory bowel diseases such as @entity295 's and ulcerative colitis , but as these also present other more serious symptoms such as weight loss , bleeding and mucus , a diagnosis of lactose intolerance alone is no reason to be alarmed			2
but those who smugly think they can consume lactose for the rest of their lives should also think again			2
' @entity309 starts to diminish in a lot of people in their 60s and 70s , ' says professor @entity210 , ' which is why older people find they can not eat certain food any more			0
' @entity316 is n't just present in milk , but it 's used in all sorts of foods , such as whitener in loaves of bread			2
' i 've now started to reintroduce milk in a small way			2
i now take it in tea and coffee , and like many with lactose intolerance , i have just enough lactase in my small intestine to be able to cope with these amounts			2
for the time being , i appear not to have passed on my intolerance to my children , who are both nearly in double figures , and seem able to drink milk with impunity			0
but as soon as one of them emits a tell - tale burp , i 'll snatch the glass , and tell them to leave the rest of the herd .			0

for 3 million lactose intolerant @entity31 a glass of milk it is not welcome
but a genetic mutation in the majority means they can enjoy it for years
