@entity1 ’s opportunity rover has provided the world with incredible insights into the mysterious red planet			0
in its ten years on @entity6 , the rover has uncovered evidence of water , taken impressive selfies and been at the centre of an international probe into a ‘ doughnut ’ on the alien surface			2
but now @entity1 is pulling funding for the rover , according to newly released details of its 2015 budget			0
opportunity landed on @entity6 in 2004 in what was to be a three - month mission			1
10 years later , and it is still active on the red planet the $ 17.5 billion ( £ 10.5 billion ) budget , which still requires @entity25 approval , will also put an end to the orbiting @entity28 mission on september , 2016			1
‘ there are pressures all over the place , ’ @entity1 ’s planetary science division director @entity29 said during an advisory council committee teleconference call on wednesday			0
opportunity touched down on in january 2004 , several weeks after its twin spirit			2
both rovers outlasted their warranty by years , but @entity39 stopped phoning home in 2010 after getting stuck in sand			0
a panoramic image of the @entity6 area named ' @entity44 , ' showing ' @entity45 ' and the surrounding plains of @entity47 on @entity6 taken by the @entity35 a selfie taken by the opportunity rover ahead of its 10 year anniversary earlier this year opportunity landed on @entity6 in 2004 in what was to be a three - month mission			1
instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years			0
the rover is currently at ' @entity57 ' at the rim of @entity59 on @entity6			0
the rover has n't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet			0
during its time on @entity6 , the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals			0
their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water			0
early discoveries by the two rovers pointed to a planet that was once tropical and moist			0
however , the signs of water suggested an acidic environment that would have been too harsh for microbes			0
more recently , @entity35 uncovered geologic evidence of water at @entity59 that 's more suited for drinking — a boon for scientists searching for extra-terrestrial places where primitive life could have thrived			0
@entity1 ’s @entity87 received a better deal in the budget proposal receiving $ 59.4 million ( £ 35.7 million ) to support its operations next year , and a steady $ 58 million ( £ 35 million ) a year after that			1
the 2015 budget also includes proposals for $ 92 million ( £ 55.4 million ) for work on a new , unnamed , @entity6 rover that is expected to launch in 2020			1
the space agency currently spends about $ 13 million ( £ 7.8 million ) a year to support the opportunity rover			1
@entity1 , however , could still choose to restore funding for @entity35 if @entity25 approves an president @entity99 ’s for requested budget supplement			2
president @entity99 's 2015 @entity1 budget plan includes funding for a robotic mission as well as space taxis to the @entity106 the proposed 2015 federal budget allocated $ 17.5 billion ( £ 10.5 billion ) to @entity1			1
the space agency has set aside $ 15 million ( £ 9 million ) to plan a robotic mission to @entity111 ’s moon , @entity112			1
@entity87 will receive $ 59.4 million ( £ 35.7 million ) to support its operations next year , and a steady $ 58 million ( £ 35 million ) a year after that			1
@entity1 ’s budget also includes funding for a commercial ventures to fly to the @entity106 the agency could have $ 1.1 billion ( £ 600 million ) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis that would do this			1
the new budget also includes $ 3.1 billion ( £ 1.9 billion ) for @entity1 to operate the @entity106 it provides $ 2.8 billion ( £ 1.7 billion ) to continue development of the @entity125 heavy - lift rocket and @entity127 capsule for future human missions to the moon , asteroids and @entity6			1
planning for the so - called @entity131 gets a boost to $ 133 million ( £ 80 million ) in the 2015 budget proposal , up from $ 78 million ( £ 47 million ) in 2014			2
the space agency has also set aside $ 15 million ( £ 9 million ) in its budget proposal to start planning some kind of mission to @entity112			1
as well as a mission to @entity112 , president @entity99 's 2015 @entity1 budget includes funding for commercial ventures to fly astronauts to the @entity106			1
the agency could have $ 1.1 billion ( £ 600 million ) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis to fly astronauts to and from the space station			1
the research outpost , a project of 15 nations , flies about 260 miles ( 420 km ) above @entity149			0
since the space shuttles were retired in 2011 , the @entity150 is dependent on @entity152 to fly crews to the space station at a cost of more than $ 65 million ( £ 40 million ) a seat			2
planning for the so - called @entity131 gets a boost to $ 133 million ( £ 80 million ) in the 2015 budget proposal , up from $ 78 million ( £ 47 million ) in 2014			2
the proposed budget keeps the @entity161 successor program - an infrared observatory known as the @entity164 - on track for launch in 2018			0
it also lets @entity1 begin planning for a new telescope to probe the mysterious force known as ‘ dark energy ’ that is driving the universe apart at faster and faster rates			0
planning for the so - called @entity131 gets a boost to $ 133 million ( £ 80 million ) in the 2015 budget proposal , up from $ 78 million ( £ 47 million ) in 2014			2

plan would also put an end to the orbiting @entity28 mission in 2016
*curiosity* will get $ 59.4 million ( £ 35.7 million ) to support mission next year
$ 15 million ( £ 9 million ) has been set aside to plan a mission to @entity112
@entity183 could have $ 1.1 billion ( £ 600 million ) for commercial *flights* to @entity106
$ 17.5 billion ( £ 10.5 billion ) budget still requires @entity25 approval
