by @entity0 published : 23:19 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 03:20 est , 1 february 2013 an amateur dramatic society is finally staging its production of a musical tackling immigration and racial prejudice - after taking two years to find any black actors			1
@entity6 , which is based in @entity7 , @entity8 , had decided to produce @entity9 , set in 1902 @entity10 - but the theatrical group had no black people among its 80 members			1
the only black person they knew working in the market town was a pharmacist - who did not sing or act - and the group ’s committee said it would be inappropriate to allow white actors to ‘ black - up ’			1
@entity21 : the cast of the @entity9 in @entity8 , which stars @entity23 and @entity24 ( front ) members had to go on a recruitment drive , including approaching certain black people they spotted at work or out shopping			1
they finally found their leading man and lady from towns 30 miles away			1
the society had hoped to stage the show last year but had to postpone it upon failing to fill the 10 black roles in time			2
but it now has three black men and three black women in a 55 - strong cast			2
society member @entity42 , 61 , said : ‘ @entity7 and the surrounding areas have largely white populations , which is reflected in our membership			0
‘ when we are looking for a white man or a white girl we have 100,000 options and therefore rarely have trouble filling these roles			0
practice : the cast of @entity9 the musical in rehearsals			1
it took two years to find black actors for the show teamwork : @entity6 decided to produce the musical , which looks at immigration and racism ‘ however , with @entity9 , we need around 10 black performers , who are able to sing and act to a high standard			1
unfortunately , there are very few black families in our catchment area to begin with			0
‘ by the time you take out those who are the wrong age or wrong gender and those who can not sing and act we lose a further 90 per cent			0
the odds of finding the right people are stacked against us			0
’ he added : ‘ we discussed the option of blacking up early on but dismissed it immediately because it is not appropriate in modern theatre practice			0
‘ you could put white people in the shadows and pretend they are black , or have them on stage as a silhouette , but we want to do it properly			1
ideally , we would like 10 black actors and actresses			1
’ jazz hands : after two years @entity6 have filled all the roles for @entity9 , which will be on in april instructions : @entity90 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) pictured with director @entity91 ( centre ) leading man @entity93 , 48 , who plays @entity94 , said : ‘ it 's been a struggle finding black people from this area to fill the roles			1
' i 've got about 5,000 friends or followers on @entity103 and i promoted the musical on there in a bid to find actors but we have still not got all we would like			2
‘ most of my black friends and followers are from larger cities , rather than rural @entity8 and @entity112			2
everybody at the society has been incredibly friendly and very welcoming			0
’ @entity116 - based race consultant @entity115 said : ‘ there are not many black people living in this part of the country , so i understand why the society has had some difficulty filling the roles			1
‘ it 's very brave of the society to stand by their principles and not go down the easy route of allowing white actors to black - up			2
musical posters : the society 's committee refused to let white actors ' black - up ' after deeming it inappropriate finally on : the society had hoped to stage the show last year but failed to fill the 10 black roles in time ‘ letting white actors black - up would be totally inappropriate			1
some people might be outraged at white people blacking - up but i think we have moved beyond that now			2
’ the @entity6 was forced to cancel a production called the @entity149 last year in the wake of the @entity151 ( right ) sex scandal			0
the show was due to be performed at a local hall in november but organisers decided to scrap it following complaints by the public			0
the group had already spend thousands of pounds promoting the show with materials featuring @entity151			0
the 400 - seater theatre at the @entity164 , in @entity165 , @entity112 , will host five performances of the musical , with tickets costing £ 14.50 each			0
rehearsals started one month ago			0
the society 's show posters say : ‘ this show follows the explosive relationships as immigrants arrive on the great liners to a new land already struggling with racial harmony and injustice			0
' this real - life drama , set at the turn of the century , follows the struggle of the black community to assert their independence from the white community , against a background of the country flooded with @entity188 immigrants hungry for a new life , and industrial and civil strife			2

@entity6 will stage musical @entity9 set in 1902 @entity10
@entity8 - based group *previously* had no black people among 80 actors
it eventually had to recruit black actors from 30 miles away to play parts
