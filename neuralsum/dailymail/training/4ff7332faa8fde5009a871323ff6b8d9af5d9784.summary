@entity0 will make a further attempt to cut @entity3 's extravagant costs on thursday			1
ahead of a meeting of the @entity5 that comprises the ' big five ' - @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , plus the sixth - placed team from the recent championship , @entity6 - @entity0 is to propose another engine change			1
there is no doubt considerable blame for the financial crisis that engulfed the sport at the end of the season was laid at the door of the introduction of the new 1.6 - litre @entity26 turbo - charged power units that replaced the old 2.4 - litre @entity27			1
@entity10 dominated 2014 in @entity3 , winning the constructors ' championship with ease @entity31 claimed the drivers ' championship after a thrilling duel with @entity35 @entity0 is set to propose to the five biggest teams a return to old engine power units the three power unit manufacturers in @entity10 , @entity8 and @entity40 spent millions of pounds in development , and in a bid to recoup some of their costs have naturally charged their customers accordingly			1
it meant from an annual outlay of around £ 5million for the @entity27 , teams were suddenly asked to find around £ 15 - 20m , ultimately forcing the likes of @entity49 and @entity50 out of business			1
as for @entity6 , @entity53 and @entity54 , the trio suggested a far more equitable distribution of the sport 's £ 575m revenue to ease their financial concerns , but that ultimately cut little ice with @entity0 despite numerous talks			1
now @entity0 is to head into the @entity5 meeting proposing a potential return to the @entity27 , or even @entity65			1
' we recognise the biggest problem these teams have is the amount they have to spend on the power unit , ' said @entity0			2
' i believe if you got everybody in the room , secret ballot , there would only be one company interested in retaining this engine , and that is @entity10			2
' you ca n't blame them because they have done a super job , and the others have n't , so they 've a big advantage			0
' is that good for @entity3 ? i think not , because we can all put our money together and have a wager they will win the championship next year , and probably the year after , which is not really the sort of thing we are looking for			0
' i have been proposing , and am going to propose , at the next meeting we go back to a normally - aspirated engine with some hybrid bits built into it			0
@entity49 , whose driver @entity99 crashed spectacularly in @entity100 in march , went bust this year ' the teams , manufacturers will have to call it a " @entity9 hybrid " , " @entity8 hybrid " or a " @entity12 hybrid "			2
' it 's so we get across the message they are hybrids , but nobody tells anybody			0
' it 's the best - kept secret actually as to what this engine is for , why it was designed and what have we achieved with it because it is a fantastic bit of engineering , it really is			0
' suggested to @entity0 that @entity10 would quit @entity3 if the sport reverted back to a @entity27 or @entity124 , he replied : ' i think they 'll do it when it suits them anyway			1
' we 've noticed in the past manufacturers have done that , but i would be surprised if they did			0
' @entity50 , for whom @entity133 @entity132 was a driver , were also put out of business due to engine costs as to a timescale , @entity0 is proposing its introduction in 2016 , adding : ' these are my ideas			1
' nobody can do anything with the engine we currently have , apart from spend a lot of money			0
' i have spoken to one of the engine people and they thought the type of engine we are talking about , the development costs would be really small			2
' i have always thought , though , it would be an uphill struggle to get @entity10 to ditch what they have built , and honestly we should n't ask them			2
it would need to be them volunteering			0
' but what are they going to say ? them saying " the other people are useless , we are great , so we 're happy to help " is not going to happen is it ? ' but if they 're prepared to reduce the cost of the engine then the problem disappears , then there 's no need for a new engine			0
we keep what we have			0

@entity49 and @entity50 went out of business last season
costs *spiralled* due to development of new engines
@entity10 made the most of changes and dominated the season
@entity0 to suggest return to old engines in bid to reduce costs
but suggestion could *affect* @entity10 ' dominance of the sport
