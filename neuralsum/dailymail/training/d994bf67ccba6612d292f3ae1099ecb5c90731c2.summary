@entity1 clubs splashed out a whopping £ 220,800,000 on new strikers during last summer 's transfer window , with mixed results to say the least			1
while some players have taken to life in @entity8 like ducks to water , finding the back of the net on a regular basis and immediately earning a place in the hearts of supporters , others have n't been quite so lucky			0
but with a huge disparity between the fees shelled out on new attacking talent , which acquisitions have been the best value so far ? @entity22 , pictured celebrating against @entity23 , was the most expensive striker signed last summer @entity25 forward @entity24 , pictured celebrating against @entity26 , has netted six league goals already @entity23 striker @entity28 ( centre ) is yet to find the back of the net after swapping @entity31 for @entity32 to decide , @entity33 has done some calculations and worked out the cost of each top - flight goal scored by the forwards signed for cold , hard cash last summer			1
and with those who arrived on free transfers before the window slammed shut back on september 1 exempt , @entity43 's @entity42 has emerged as the best buy			0
the former @entity46 and @entity47 man moved to @entity48 from relegated @entity49 in late july for just £ 800,000 and has since scored three league goals			0
the 27 - year - old netted in wins against @entity53 and @entity54 before scoring in the @entity43 ' 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity56 , giving him an impressive cost - per - goal of just under £ 267,000 - the best return in the division			2
@entity43 's @entity42 has cost just under £ 267,000 per goal so far this season former @entity49 striker @entity42 celebrates scoring in @entity43 's 3 - 2 win at @entity62 in september @entity63 ( @entity53 ) - 3 goals @entity65 ( @entity56 ) - 1 goal @entity67 ( @entity68 ) - 1 goal @entity70 ( @entity71 ) - 3 goals @entity26 's @entity73 has been hitting the headlines in recent weeks and , after costing @entity75 just £ 1.5million from @entity76 , sits second in our countdown			1
three winning goals against @entity80 , @entity23 and @entity81 mean the 21 - year - old 's strikes have cost £ 500,000 apiece so far - a figure which looks certain to reduce significantly as the season goes on			1
completing the top three is @entity87 's @entity86 , who has managed six goals in his eight @entity1 appearances since moving to @entity90 from @entity91 for £ 3.5m			1
the @entity93 forward has cost the @entity87 £ 583,000 per goal after finding the back of the net in consecutive matches against @entity98 , @entity23 , @entity46 , @entity99 , @entity100 and champions @entity101			2
@entity26 's @entity73 ( left ) and @entity87 's @entity86 have turned out to be two of the best bargains two of last summer 's big - money transfers saw @entity107 and @entity22 swap @entity108 for @entity8 for a combined cost of £ 62million			1
@entity110 @entity107 has hit the ground running at @entity112 after leaving @entity113 , scoring eight top - flight goals in 10 appearances to begin paying back his £ 30million fee			1
those strikes , the most recent of which came against @entity68 last weekend , mean @entity107 has cost the @entity119 £ 3.75m per goal , while £ 32m man @entity22 has set @entity56 back £ 3.2m for every strike after netting 10 goals in just nine games			1
@entity112 forward @entity107 has paid back a large chunk of his £ 30m fee with eight goals this season @entity22 became an instant hit at @entity56 after netting 10 goals in nine @entity1 appearances it 's been a different story for @entity133 's other attacking acquisition , with £ 16m forward @entity134 having scored just twice in the @entity1			1
his cost of £ 8m per goal is the same as @entity138 , who remained in west @entity139 with @entity141 's side after deciding to leave @entity99			2
@entity142 is another young striker with a hefty price - tag to contend with after leaving @entity56 to join @entity53 on a £ 28m permanent deal following a successful loan spell last term			2
the 21 - year - old @entity147 has managed four goals under @entity149 this season , making him one of the more costly summer additions at £ 7m a goal so far			2
@entity142 ( left ) and @entity134 have proved to be two of the costliest strikers so far this season the former @entity156 youngster has still fared considerably better than @entity158 ' summer signings across @entity159 though , with @entity160 and @entity28 yet to find the back of the net in the league			2
@entity28 , a £ 16m buy from @entity31 , has only managed to score in the @entity164 against @entity165 and in the @entity166 against @entity68 while £ 4m @entity160 has struggled to make his mark since leaving @entity168			0
there 's better news for @entity168 fans , who have a new hero in £ 8m @entity25 frontman @entity24			0
the former @entity175 striker has already hit six goals in his debut campaign , at a cost of £ 1.33m per strike			0
@entity180 ( left ) and @entity181 have had mixed fortunes since joining @entity168 last summer manager @entity183 also splashed out £ 12m on @entity98 's @entity181 but the @entity184 international is only just starting to find his form			0
his brace against @entity54 last weekend means he has cost a substantial £ 6m a goal during his brief spell in red and white			0
@entity46 opted to pursue a late loan deal for @entity193 's prolific striker @entity192 , eventually bringing the @entity194 to @entity195 on a temporary deal for the season			0
but it 's not happened for the former @entity199 star in @entity200 , with his £ 6m loan fee paying for just a single goal - the winner against @entity53 at @entity195 last month			0
@entity46 have had just one goal from @entity192 after paying a £ 6m loan fee for the striker like @entity33 's facebook page			0

@entity1 clubs spent over £ *200million* on new strikers last summer
@entity22 and @entity107 were the most expensive forwards signed
but they have begun to repay their fees with goals for @entity56 and @entity112
@entity73 has cost @entity26 £ 500,000 per goal so far this season
@entity86 among best value strikers after six goals for @entity87
