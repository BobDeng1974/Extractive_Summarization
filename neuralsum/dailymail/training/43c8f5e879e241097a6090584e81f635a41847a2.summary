the £ 4,500 cost of moving a palm tree 300 metres was described as farcical last night			1
@entity2 , which faces budget cuts of £ 3.8million , was already under fire for stumping up £ 7,000 to import the 20ft canary date palm from @entity6 to erect on a roundabout billed as the gateway to @entity9 in @entity10			1
but now the tree has been moved to a new site just up the road at the entrance to a shopping centre to make way for a dual carriageway			2
@entity2 staff facing redundancies would be astonished and aghast at such a waste of public money			0
’ the tree was the brainchild of @entity2 ’s mayor , @entity21 , who said ‘ we wanted to make a real impact so we decided to “ go large ” ’ with the palm			2
during last winter the tree had to be wrapped in a hessian sack , to stop it being damaged by frost , which critics claimed made it look like a giant phallus			1
the tree was the idea of @entity2 ’s mayor , @entity21			0
he said : ' we wanted to make a real impact so we decided to ‘ go large ’ by bringing in the six - metre high palm			0
' it will leave our many thousands of visitors with an abiding memory when they set off for home			0

@entity55 spent £ 7,000 importing the giant 6 metre tall palm tree
the @entity6 tree needed to be covered last year because of frost
now , the council must *pay* £ 4,500 to move the tree £ 4,500 for a new road
