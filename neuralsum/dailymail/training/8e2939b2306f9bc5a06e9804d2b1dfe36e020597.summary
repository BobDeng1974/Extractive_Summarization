by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:08 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 07:11 est , 10 october 2013 badgers could be gassed by the government after a planned cull failed to kill enough of the animals , @entity2 said today			1
the environment secretary yesterday blamed the badgers for ' moving the goalposts ' after marksmen culled fewer than half the 2,000 animals targeted			1
now he has admitted the government is ' looking at gassing ' , amid reports that some of the animals had already been gassed illegally			2
@entity17 : thousands of badgers are being culled in pilots which ministers say will help curb the spread of @entity22 in cattle herds officials yesterday announced a new , lower estimate of the badger population , making it easier to hit the 70 per cent target for culling			1
but a six week - cull in @entity31 which ended on sunday will have to be restarted , with opponents accusing the government of ‘ adjusting the figures to make it look like this is a success ’			1
mr @entity2 complained that the badgers themselves were making the cull more difficult than expected			1
' the badgers moved the goalposts			1
we 're dealing with a wild animal , subject to the vagaries of the weather and disease and breeding patterns , ' he told @entity49			2
trouble : environment secretary @entity2 blamed the badgers for the cull falling short today he defended the much - ridiculed remark , saying he was ' stating the screamingly obvious '			1
he went on to confirm that gassing is now being considered			0
speaking in the @entity54 mr @entity2 told @entity55 : ' until we can establish vaccines , we have to use the tools employed by other sensible countries which is to remove wildlife			1
we made it quite clear in our @entity22 strategy that we would look at other methods of removing wildlife			2
' and yes we are looking at gassing , but we will not use it unless it is proven to be safe , humane and effective			0
' but @entity67 condemned the idea			0
shadow environment secretary @entity69 said : ' gassing badgers has been proven to be inhumane and it is unacceptable for @entity2 to be considering it , just because his unscientific , costly and misguided cull is not working			1
' instead of blaming the badgers for the failure of his policy , it ’s time for a coherent plan to eradicate @entity22 through vaccination of both badgers and cattle , together with tougher rules on the movement of livestock			1
' badgers are blamed for spreading tuberculosis ( @entity22 ) in cattle herds , and the coalition ordered pilot culls in @entity31 and @entity91 to curb the disease			1
the aim was for marksmen to kill 70 per cent of badgers by free shooting , which meant culling 2,081 of the 2,400 animals in @entity31			1
but officials now admit just 850 badgers were shot during the six - week trial			2
the @entity91 trial is due to end next week			0
in an attempt to claim the plan is working , ministers now say the badger population is only 1,450 – meaning 59 per cent of the animals have been killed			0
opposition : campaigners from the @entity109 looking for marksmen in the village of @entity112 , @entity31 the trial culls could now be extended by up to three weeks to give the marksmen more time to meet their targets			2
the original 5,000 target was based on 2012 estimates of badger populations			0
but newer research showed numbers had now fallen by around a third , because of flooding , food scarcity and disease			0
badger expert professor @entity125 said the failure to kill enough animals meant the trials should now be stopped			0
she said : ‘ when you kill badgers two things happen			2
the first is there are fewer badgers , and for disease control that should be a good thing			0
‘ but also you change the behaviour of badgers in ways which increase the transmission of disease in badgers , so each badger is more infectious to cattle ... they are more likely to travel , and they are mixing more with badgers from other social groups			0
’ meanwhile , @entity148 , @entity149 chief executive , said : ‘ frankly this whole situation is a farce			0
‘ whatever the figures , it is clear that the system has failed			0
’ despite widespread opposition , the government has been committed to the controversial scheme , which it hopes will help limit the spread of tuberculosis in cattle			2
@entity163 guitarist @entity162 said figures showing the number of badgers killed were ‘ widely disparate ’ , and urged ministers to abandon the ‘ ridiculous ’ cull .			0

@entity2 defends claim that badgers ' moved the goalposts '
environment secretary *reveals* government is considering gassing instead
@entity177 told to kill 70 *%* of badgers in two pilots to curb spread of @entity22
but in @entity31 only 850 of the 2,000 badgers targeted were culled
