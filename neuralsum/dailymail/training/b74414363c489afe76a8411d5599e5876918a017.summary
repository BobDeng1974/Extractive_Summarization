ask any woman to tip out the contents of her make - up bag and you ’re likely to be met with a guilty grimace			1
a survey revealed that the average @entity7 woman requires 55 minutes to get ready each morning — and that does n’t include showering			1
if skincare is included , 11 per cent of us slap an extraordinary 40 - plus products on to our faces every day			1
i have always considered myself fairly low - maintenance — yet when i turn out my make - up bag , i am shocked to discover i regularly use a whopping 16 different products , from @entity18 ( blemish balm ) cream to concealer to eyeshadow			1
but in an age of multi-tasking , why ca n’t a lipstick double up as a blusher , or a foundation work as a concealer ? as a working mother - of - three , finding the time for my entire beauty routine can be a luxury			1
but what if i could apply one product instead of five ? with this in mind , i swapped my usual 16 products for just three , multi-function items			1
here ’s how i got on			2
the super foundation @entity46 3 in @entity47 what : @entity49 , £ 12.99 for 30ml the claim : this ‘ holds like a primer , corrects like a concealer , with the long - lasting finish of a liquid foundation with @entity55 ’			1
@entity57 : @entity18 , primer , foundation , concealer and translucent powder , which cost £ 110			1
application : i brushed the foundation to my face , then blended			1
i applied more around the dark shadows of the eye area as i would a concealer			1
this took all of one minute , whereas my usual five products take me nearer ten			1
the effect was fine until after lunchtime when this multi-function make - up needed topping up			2
@entity75 : celebrity make - up artist @entity76 , who has tended the faces of @entity78 and @entity79 among others , says : ‘ i did n’t think this blended well			1
it ’s also effective to have a separate concealer			2
’ verdict : the 3 in 1 is certainly cheap , fast to apply and lightweight to carry			0
but it did n’t hold well on my skin , all but sliding off			2
a handy standby for when i ’m on - the - run , but i wo n’t be swapping my five trusty regulars for this			1
4/10 cheeks and lips what : @entity93 and @entity95 pencil , £ 24 ( includes sharpener ) the claim : ‘ an extra-creamy soft - feeling lip - liner , lip colour and cheek cream all in one ’ , promising colour , cover and ‘ blendability ’			2
@entity103 and @entity95 pencil @entity57 : lip - liner , lipstick and gloss , blusher and highlighter , which cost £ 78			1
application : i applied pencil around my lip line , then filled in over the lips themselves			0
i thought the sensation of using a pencil rather than a velvety lipstick would be odd , but it felt remarkably smooth			2
and when i simply drew a pencil - line on my cheeks , i was sure it would be obvious even after blending , but the effect was natural			2
@entity75 : @entity76 says : ‘ this gives a lovely , dewy , natural look			0
on the lips , the creamy texture of the @entity93 lets you dab your finger to apply it like a tint , if you do n’t want to pencil it on			2
it ’s so easy to blend , it works almost like a highlighter , and i like the look of wearing the same colour on your lips and cheeks			0
’ verdict : normally i would use different shades for lips and cheeks , but i loved this and would use it again			0
even the tin box it comes in looks classy			0
10/10 @entity146 the product : @entity148 and @entity149 , £ 26.50 , applicator , £ 20 @entity148 and @entity149 the claim : ‘ a waterproof cream that features a dual transformation texture			0
the solid cream becomes liquid on application then sets on the skin for lasting hold			0
’ @entity57 : two separate eyeliners , eyeshadow , brow pencil , brow fixer gel and mascara , worth £ 100			0
application : using a specially designed applicator — a brush at one end to shape the brows , and an angled flat brush at the other to apply liner or colour to the lid — i painted on a flicked line on top of my lashes , some shading underneath the eye , and blended colour on the lid			0
using the eyebrow brush end , i put more colour on my brows			0
you can even brush a little on your lashes as a mascara			0
it took barely two minutes compared to the normal 11			1
nothing smudged and it stayed on all day			0
@entity75 : @entity76 says : ‘ i quite often use eyeshadow to colour brows			0
but i do think a lot of us would miss mascara			0
’ verdict : with nine shades to choose from , a tiny compact and a clever brush , this product is a multi-tasker			0
9/10 @entity201 16 become three ? with the price of my make - up regime slashed by £ 204.50 ( from £ 288 to £ 83.50 ) , and the time needed reduced from 25 minutes to a scant five , the three wonder products are impressive , despite having to touch up the 3 - in - 1 foundation part way through the day			1
with more practice , i could achieve everything i get from my normal routine			0
but for a special occasion , i would stick with my carefully chosen , separate products .			2

the average @entity7 woman requires 55 minutes to get ready
including skincare , 11 per cent of us slap 40 - plus products on to our faces
in an age of multi-tasking , why ca n’t a lipstick double up as a blusher ?
or can a foundation work as a concealer ?
