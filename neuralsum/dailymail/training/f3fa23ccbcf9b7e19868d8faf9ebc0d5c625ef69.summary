by @entity0 this is the terrifying moment a pair of backpackers were robbed at gunpoint by two masked bandits - and caught it all on headcam			1
@entity8 and companion @entity9 were riding a motorbike along a dirt road in @entity12 when they were ambushed			1
two men in balaclavas jumped from bushes waving a gun and a machete and forced them to stop			1
@entity8 , an illustrator from @entity54 , and her companion @entity55 , both 34 , were badly shaken but unhurt in the april 10 raid on the road between @entity58 and @entity59 in @entity33			1
the apparently brazen daylight robbery was filmed on the headcam being worn by @entity55 , though the footage has not yet been verified			0
she said : ' when the first " bandito " ran out ahead of us pointing a gun , there was an initial feeling of dread			0
' then the second man jumped out with a machete demanding money and we knew the best thing to do was give them what they want and get out of there			2
' i ’d hidden my valuables well and left my backpack at the hotel out of caution			0
the men took the pair 's wallets from their pockets , before pulling the rings from @entity8 's fingers @entity8 has been travelling across @entity88 since november last year			1
she met @entity89 in @entity90 and the pair are now biking across @entity12 despite their ordeal , @entity8 and @entity55 are still in the country and are encouraging others to visit ' i felt violated , being searched and having rings pulled off my fingers by a masked , armed robber , but the feeling of not knowing how far it will go was the worst thing			1
' she added : ' @entity55 ’s motorcycle tank bag was cut off with a machete			0
' it contained a fake wallet with expired cards and a real $ 100 note and a few electronic items such as an e-reader , @entity46 and @entity45			1
' luckily we had hidden our bank cards , money , and other valuables elsewhere			0
' apparently this road is notorious for robberies though we had n’t seen any reports online for a few years and people we met had used it with no issues			2
' @entity8 started backpacking in @entity120 in november and has also been chased by a pack of wild dogs			1
the robbers searched a bag tied to the bike containing cash , an @entity46 , @entity45 and money , before cutting it free @entity8 and @entity55 say the road is known for trouble , but there had n't been any crime reports in the last couple of years and other travellers told them it was safe she met @entity55 in @entity90 and teamed up with him on his motorcycle trip from @entity24 to @entity137			1
she added : ' i would still recommend people visit beautiful @entity12 and not be put off by crimes like this			2
' otherwise this has felt like a very safe country with warm and kind inhabitants			0
' @entity55 added : ' to all of the @entity12 apologizing for your country , thank you very much			1
' we know that it is only a small percentage of @entity12 that are bad people , just like anywhere			2
we loved our time spent in @entity12 and the @entity12 people			2
we would definitely come back ! ' to the people who think this video is fake : believe me , it 's very real			0
i 'm in the middle of a motorcycle trip from @entity24 to the bottom of @entity88 , i do n't have the time or desire to produce fake videos and put them on the internet			2
' i know there is a ton of fake stuff on the internet , so i really ca n't blame you for having doubts			0
the bandits also made off with the satnav @entity55 was using to plot their @entity88 trip @entity8 said luckily the pair had hidden their real cards elsewhere , and the wallet was full of fakes @entity12 is a country know for its high gun crime , and the gun death rate is double the global average ' like i said in the write up , i removed the audio because my girlfriend requested me to so the whole world would n't hear her , understandably , freaking out			1
' the guy was trying to steal my gps when i took off			0
they were n't done robbing us			0
' i felt like we could get away so i pulled the bike ahead about a foot to test them , it seemed ok , so i took off			0
' he did n't even notice my camera but it 's a black @entity197 on a black helmet and blends in pretty well			1
just lucky i guess ... '			0
