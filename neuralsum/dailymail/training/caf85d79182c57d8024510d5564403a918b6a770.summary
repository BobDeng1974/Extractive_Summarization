' the advert goes on to say : ' it 's one thing to make a bigger display			0
it 's something else entirely to make a bigger bendable display with brilliant colours and higher contract at even extreme viewing angles			0
' but that 's exactly what we did with the new @entity102 display *			0

a video , uploaded to @entity136 by user @entity137 , shows the @entity138 bending using just his fingers			0
it has already been viewed more than 18.5 million times			0
today it was revealed that if your @entity138 has become bent out of shape , @entity0 may offer you a replacement			2
a support employee told @entity148 during a web chat that the decision would be ' 100 per cent up to the store ' in which the device was returned to - and that it would be on a case - by - case basis			1
but , the employee added that if , following an inspection , the damage met certain guidelines then a free replacement would be covered by the phone 's warranty			2
@entity0 has not released an official line about the replacements , and is not commenting on reports that the larger handset is vulnerable to being bent			1
following the unveiling of @entity0 ’s smartwatch , internet jokers rushed to post pictures of their own version of the gadget			1
these included a red apple carved into a classic wristwatch design with a rounded face ( pictured ) , created by @entity178 @entity11 user @entity176 since the @entity138 ( pictured ) launched on friday , reports have emerged that ' a small but growing number ' of owners are claiming the frame bends if the device is left in pockets for an extended period of time			1
an @entity0 support employee has since revealed the firm may replace bent devices - but only on a case - by - case basis the reason for the bend is due to the @entity138 being made out of aluminium			1
aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so , if enough pressure is applied , it will bend and move			2
according to @entity201 , no part of either of the new @entity200 has more than a quarter of an inch ( 0.64cm ) of aluminium in any spot			0
this means that , in areas of the phones that are weakest , it ’s possible it could be susceptible to bending			0
this is noticeable in images , with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the sim card slot			0
these areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and sim card , so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend			0
to stop the phone bending , users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone			2
for example , do not have it sideways in a pocket , as your pocket will push it against your leg , possibly causing bending			0
putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect , so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option			0
another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied			0
it has been reported that the thinner design of the 5.5 - inch phone and the use of aluminum on the frame will cause the new @entity138 ( pictured ) to bend if pressure is applied the bendy feature of the new @entity6 ( pictured ) has been met with wide criticism on social media while many are creating spoof adverts , other @entity11 users flagged up the fact that many handsets will bend under a similar amount of pressure			1
app developer ‏ @ drbarnard said : ' it ’s actually impressive that the 6 @entity59 does n’t break			0
seems like that much pressure on any device would do damage			0
' while @entity272 co-editor @ panzer added : ' just an anecdote : i carried around the @entity138 for 5 days in a pocket at @entity277 on rides & coasters and did not bend it			0
' reports in 2012 claimed that the @entity281 had similar frame weaknesses			0
the @entity284 release last year was met with similar complaints			0
and as @entity0 's bad week continues , the firm was forced to remove its latest software update following reports it broke certain features on the new handset			1
as its the second major issue to arise with @entity0 's newest iphone since it was launched on friday , many are claiming the @entity6 and @entity138 are the most troubled new products since the @entity292 and ' antennagate			1
' other devices have been released recently that were specifically designed to have a curved frame , including the @entity298 ( pictured )			0
the phone is said to be more comfortable to hold , and easier to place in a back pocket			0
