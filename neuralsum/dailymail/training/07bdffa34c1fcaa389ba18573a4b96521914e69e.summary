i am standing outside an innocuous white door set in an entirely white building on the island of @entity4			1
it hardly seems the setting for the most expensive restaurant in the world			1
but i am told it is the magic inside that justifies @entity11 ’s £ 1,250 per head price tag			0
this is the newest restaurant from two - @entity19 star @entity17 chef @entity16 - @entity15 ’s version of experimental chef @entity20 - and i am among the first people in the world invited to sample its unusual concept			1
the owners stand by the price , they say the cost of setting up the restaurant , the quality of the food and the 27 staff for a dozen diners explains the price			1
the also know that people will pay that for the latest dining experience in @entity4			2
the eatery - which seats just 12 people at a time - is part of the brand new @entity31 , which celebrated its grand opening this weekend with live performances at its open - air , beachside concert space from disco king @entity57 and garage stars @entity59			0
we are promised that our taster at @entity11 will be a work of theatre - appealing to every one of our senses and transporting us to another world			2
while some may shudder at the price tag , celebrities and wealthy holidaymakers are already queuing up for bookings			0
after a special coded knock , we are invited through the white door to a tiny room , with little more than a few artfully - placed boxes and a giant nitrogen tank - a key ingredient in many of @entity16 ’s dishes			1
@entity16 's rose : food is served with a flourish , one course even sees diners making their own @entity83 cocktails using test tubes in a flash , the opaque window in front of us becomes transparent , giving us a glimpse of the 27 staff working in the kitchen to create the 20 - course meal that is served up over a two - and - a - half hour ‘ performance ’ in the restaurant			1
we are led into a old metal lift that - with the help of screens , lights and simulators - gives us the impression of plunging down below ground as music blares all around us			0
it feels a bit like a @entity106 ride , guests giggling nervously , wondering what on earth comes next			0
we emerge into an all - white room with a white table and padded white chairs , with our names are beamed onto the table as place settings			0
beautiful backdrop : light and laser effects create different worlds , including this one featuring @entity121 ' @entity120 , to accompany each dish ambiance : the temperature in the room , the humidity and even the smells can be altered to suit each dish , along with the musical accompaniment two waitresses are dressed as air stewardesses , there is a compere who will introduce our dishes to us and light and laser effects create different worlds to accompany each separate dish			0
@entity16 wants the exact tricks of the trade to remain a secret , but needless to say , the white surfaces of the room do n’t stay white for long as different settings and videos are beamed onto them , creating a backdrop for the plates and other unusual crockery put in front of us			2
food is served with a flourish			0
we make our own @entity83 cocktails using test tubes presented to us in a giant book			1
nitrogen - frozen olive oil is added to bread and tomato in an unusual modern twist on the traditional @entity17 dish pan con tomate , and separate olive oil parcels are presented to us suspended on a mini washing line - complete with pegs			1
presentation is everything : as well as serving up food in nitrogen clouds and novelty crockery , the ever - changing decor takes diners to another level my favourite dish is a sweet dessert served up on a spinning , levitating plate , which eventually slows down enough to allow me to eat it			1
so out there is the presentation of the food , all wispy nitrogen clouds and bizarre concoctions that mean you do n’t know what you ’re eating until it is in our mouth , that i keep half an eye on the door expecting @entity16 to make an appearance dressed as @entity193 , the deranged chocolate producer in @entity196 ’s @entity195			2
@entity16 later explains to me that while he has always been interested in what ’s on the plate , he wanted to explore diners ’ surroundings and complete the meal experience appealing to every one of our senses			2
the temperature in the room , the humidity and even the smells can be altered to suit each dish , along with the musical accompaniment			0
our 12 - person party switches from awed silence to stifled giggles and even applause as our food is presented			0
worth £ 1,250 ? the owners say yes , but it will probably be a haunt for celebrities and playboys rather than the average @entity4 holidaymaker i am not lucky enough to be treated to all 20 dishes , but even my six - dish taster takes almost an hour to ‘ perform ’ , before we spill out onto a sunny terrace to remind us that we are indeed in @entity4 and not underground in a crazy science laboratory			1
just hours after my experience , the restaurant is fully booked by millionaire racers from the @entity229 , which has just finished its 3,000 - mile odyssey across the globe from @entity232 , via @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity121 and @entity236			2
is it worth the £ 1,250 price tag ? spend 10 minutes talking to @entity16 and you will say yes			0
his passion and explanations about the food and how it is prepared are inspiring			0
he truly is @entity15 ’s @entity20			1
but this restaurant is hardly going to be attracting the average @entity4 holidaymaker			2
set in the five - star @entity31 hotel - the largest luxury resort on the island - on the beach @entity251 , which has become synonymous with @entity254 ’s millionaire party scene , i predict @entity11 will be packed out with celebrities and playboys for most of its summer season			0
thankfully , @entity16 has another restaurant - @entity258 - at the same hotel			1
with inventive tapas dishes priced from eight euros each - try the spanish tortilla that is liquified and served up in a cocktail glass ( surprisingly tasty ) - it is somewhat easier on your bank account			0
the man with a vision : super chef @entity16 says that he is interested in diners ' surroundings as well as what is on their plates easier on the wallet : @entity16 also operates out of the @entity258 restaurant , also at the @entity31 hotel , which serves more reasonable tapas dishes			1
