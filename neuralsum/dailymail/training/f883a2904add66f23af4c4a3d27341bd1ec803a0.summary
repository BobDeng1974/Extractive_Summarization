miss february : this mother wears a broad smile and nothing else in her shot for the charity calendar dare to bare : many of the mothers , all of whom have children serving in the armed forces , opted to pose topless , like miss november , left and miss march , right serious posing : while most of the women took their photograph themselves , others seem to have gone down the professional route like miss september all of the mothers got involved following an appeal from @entity7 via @entity42 and then submitted selifies or more professionally posed pictures			1
the woman are in various states of undress in the calendar , which will hit shelves by the end of next week			0
some chose to go for a good - humoured shot , donning army camouflage , face paint and pulling funny faces - while others pout provocatively into the lens with little preserving their modesty			2
money raised will go to two charities , @entity60 , which helps homeless ex-servicemen , and @entity62 , which helps veterans dealing with @entity64			1
