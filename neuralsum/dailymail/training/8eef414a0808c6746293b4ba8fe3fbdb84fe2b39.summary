the world ’s finest caviar is harvested from sturgeon in waters around @entity4 , @entity5 ... and now @entity6			1
the exotic delicacy , known as black gold for its exorbitant price tag , is being made in @entity10 for the first time			1
father and son team @entity12 and @entity13 used to breed sturgeon to sell as ornamental fish for garden ponds			2
@entity17 in @entity6 has become the first fish farm in @entity10 to produce and sell caviar after harvesting @entity21 eggs the farm had its first full harvest just two weeks ago and has already had its produce sampled by celebrity chefs now , they have teamed up with caviar trader @entity27 to produce caviar they hope will outdo the farmed @entity31 versions commonly sold in @entity10			1
but first , they had to ask a very important person for her permission			0
@entity21 , extremely rare in the @entity10 , is classified as a royal fish under ancient law , meaning the monarch has to be consulted before any caught here are sold			1
so the team wrote to the @entity40 to ask if they could start a farm			2
yesterday mr @entity27 said : ‘ we did n’t want to end up in the @entity43			0
we got a letter back from @entity45 saying she would forego her royal prerogative and the sturgeon would be our property			0
’ producing caviar is a slow and complex process			2
unfertilised roe – tiny eggs , which are the main ingredient – are extracted from female sturgeon when they reach reproductive maturity , which can be at anything from six to 25 years old , depending on the species			2
the farm is home to six different species of @entity21 , like the @entity62 pictured here with one of the farm 's owners , @entity67 between 20,000 and 30,000 @entity21 are kept in holdable tanks			1
caviar is notoriously difficult to produce as the fish do not mature at the same time , and therefore produce eggs at varying points in their lives water from the @entity75 is used at the farm and is not controlled by temperature or adjusted with chemicals mr @entity27 added : ‘ the big farms elsewhere produce about 35 tons of caviar a year			1
if we can produce 500kg a year we ’ll be happy – we ’re going for quality not quantity			0
’ the @entity17 in @entity6 has between 20,000 and 30,000 fish , which enjoy a ‘ semi-wild ’ , non-caged life in 700 - hectare freshwater lakes			1
among them are various types of sturgeon including @entity90 , which produce 1.5kg ( 53oz ) of caviar each , and a @entity94 - @entity93 cross , which produces 400g ( 14oz )			2
the only addition to the eggs is sea salt to add flavour			0
@entity21 have been classified ' @entity99 ' since the 1300s when they were given the name by @entity103 @entity104 produced two variations of produce in its first full harvest , using @entity108 and @entity110 sea salt to add a little flavour to the eggs in order to make the fish grow , the water temperature at caviar farms is usually kept at @entity117 , but the @entity119 project uses fresh running water , which is not controlled			1
mr @entity27 said : ‘ the water on our farm comes straight from the @entity75 in the @entity119 and it has no chemicals or temperature regulations			0
‘ this gives the caviar a wonderful taste , although it can mean it takes the sturgeon a longer period of time to grow			2
’ after years of waiting , the team took in their first full harvest a fortnight ago			0
and according to @entity136 - starred chefs @entity137 from @entity138 in @entity139 and @entity140 from @entity141 , they have n’t done too badly			0
in a testimonial on the farm ’s website , mr @entity142 said : ‘ you have all of the @entity10 sturgeon ’s royal history , the location of the farm in @entity6 ... it ’s brilliant			1
i think you are on to a winner			0
' @entity21 have been classified ' @entity99 ' since the 1300s when they were given the name by @entity103 not only are @entity21 rarely seen in the @entity10 but the process of harvesting their eggs is made notoriously difficult by a number of factors , making caviar such a sought after delicacy @entity164 from the @entity166 food company with one of the first crop of @entity10 caviar at the farm			1
the @entity104 has received raving reviews from customers including chef , @entity140 mr @entity140 said : ‘ @entity10 caviar – who would have thought it ? ‘ from the @entity175 , a fish that once bred in our rivers and has now gone is back			1
farmed ? yes and extremely sustainable			0
’ @entity179 , whose @entity181 restaurant has two @entity136 stars and who appeared on @entity186 cookery show @entity184 , commented : ‘ @entity187 is delicious and as good as any i ’ve tasted			0
i also love the fact that it is from a sustainable and ethical source			0
' after the eggs are removed from the females , they are washed , hand - sieved and then rested , and @entity108 sea salt is added			0
mr @entity27 , who owns caviar wholesaler @entity195 , said meat from the female fish , which are killed in harvesting , has been sent to top chefs in the hope they will find ways of putting it on their @entity203 finished product comes in tins as small as 10g – which is lucky , since even then , prices start at £ 19.99			2
just 30g costs £ 59.95 , while it is £ 99.95 for 50g , £ 249.95 for 125g and £ 500 for 250g – but that is still less than half the price of the most sought - after @entity211 , which comes mainly from the @entity212 .			1

@entity17 in @entity6 is the first fish farm in @entity10 to sell delicacy
celebrity chefs have already sampled farm 's produce
caviar is difficult to produce as fish do *n't* produce eggs at the same time
the farm is home to 20,000 to 30,000 @entity21 fish kept in holding tanks
a 30g *jar* is £ 59.99 , while 250g pots cost £ 500 from @entity232
