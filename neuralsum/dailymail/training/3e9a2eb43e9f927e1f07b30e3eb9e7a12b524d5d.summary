speaking on @entity20 this morning , @entity13 said : ' two weeks prior to her wedding she knew it was not something she wanted to do			2
' unfortunately they were obligated to honour contracts [ with the @entity28 network which had tv rights ] otherwise they would have owed a lot of people a lot of money			2
' earlier this week during an interview with @entity37 's @entity36 , @entity13 said : ' she 's never gotten over [ her ex @entity4 ]			2

' the publicist talked about how he helped generate a fake engagement story between @entity3 and @entity4 in 2007 by setting up paparazzi to take pictures of her leaving a @entity69 jewellery store			0
she then sported a ring on her wedding finger in public - which @entity13 claimed is identical to the one @entity11 proposed to @entity3 with			1
@entity13 added that there is no doubt @entity3 and @entity11 , 26 , made a packet during their time together			1
