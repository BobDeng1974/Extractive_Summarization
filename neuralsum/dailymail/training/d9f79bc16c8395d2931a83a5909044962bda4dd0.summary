by @entity0 frozen : neuroscientists have discovered exactly how the brain links its survival circuits to the spinal cord , causing the body to freeze fear is primitive			1
in the wild , it instinctively protects animals from predators - but for humans , the emotion can be far more complex			0
fear can trigger the ' fight or flight ' response to raise the heart rate , sharpen the senses and provide access to huge amounts of energy in order to cope with threats to survival			1
at times , the threat is so intense it can cause a ' freeze ' response			2
this could be interpreted as the brain being overwhelmed , or it may have evolved as a way of keeping still to hide from predators			2
now neuroscientists have discovered exactly how the brain links its survival circuits to the spinal cord , causing the body to freeze in the face of danger			1
the discovery could help develop effective treatments for emotional disorders such as anxiety , panic attacks and phobias			0
scientists know that memories are learned and stored in a small structure in the brain known as the amygdala			2
any disturbing event activates neurons in the lateral and then central portions of the amygdala			0
the signals are then communicated internally , passing from one group of neurons to the next			0
from there , they reach neurons in the brainstem , the action centre for fear responses			0
researchers believe something known as the periaqueductal gray ( @entity66 ) can trigger responses such as freezing , a high heart rate , increase in blood pressure and the desire for flight or fight			1
the discovery could help develop effective treatments for emotional disorders such as anxiety , panic attacks and phobias			0
@entity78 ( pictured ) is known to suffer from panic attacks the study by @entity81 has discovered a brain pathway leading from the @entity66 to a part of the cerebellum – a region of the brain that controls motion - named the pyramis			1
the research went on to show that the pyramis is involved in generating freezing behaviour when someone faces danger			1
‘ there is a growing consensus that understanding the neural circuits underlying fear behaviour is a fundamental step towards developing effective treatments for behavioural changes associated with emotional disorders , ’ said dr @entity93 at the @entity81			0
professor @entity102 , professor of systems neuroscience , added : ‘ our work introduces the novel concept that the cerebellum is a promising target for therapeutic strategies to manage dysregulation of emotional states such as panic disorders and phobias			0
’ panic attack : psychologists have said that humans have an innate response to danger that alerts our bodies before our cognitive brain has processed the threat			1

brain region known as periaqueductal gray ( @entity66 ) can trigger responses such as freezing , a high heart rate and increased blood pressure
study found a pathway leading from @entity66 to a region known as pyramis
@entity135 is thought to make a person freeze when they face a danger
