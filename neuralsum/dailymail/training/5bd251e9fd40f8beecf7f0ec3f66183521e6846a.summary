@entity1 star @entity0 is set to be punished by the @entity2 after a foul - mouthed outburst on the opening day of the @entity6 event in @entity7			1
while playing partner @entity8 claimed a two - shot lead with a five - under - par 67 at @entity10 - despite dropping two shots in the last six holes - @entity0 was turning the air blue			1
@entity0 was just four off the pace after a round of 71 , but the @entity16 faces a hefty fine after being caught on camera not only swearing at himself , but also using language which could be interpreted as being homophobic			1
ironically , @entity0 also attracted attention on his @entity1 debut at @entity28 for indicating to the crowd to keep quiet by putting a finger to his lips during his singles win over @entity42			1
a @entity2 spokesperson later said : ' the @entity2 's @entity45 regulations prohibit the use of obscene language on the golf course			2
the @entity2 will deal with this matter internally in accordance with its regulations			2
' the @entity2 has a policy of not disclosing any disciplinary sanctions it issues			2
@entity8 began on the back nine and played his first 12 holes in seven under par. but he then failed to get up and down from a greenside bunker on the fourth and paid the price for what he called ' a comedy of errors ' on the par - five eighth , where he missed his only fairway of the day and also pulled his approach left of the green			1
' a big key to this golf course is driving the ball well , ' @entity8 said			1
' i drove it very well today			2
i think i missed only one fairway , which is very important and the greens are in fantastic shape and i actually putted very well			2
@entity8 ( above ) leads the event in @entity7 after round one with a five - under 67 ' seven under par through 12 holes was a beautiful start			1
i dropped a couple coming in , but all in all , i am very , very pleased with five under par on what i thought was a reasonably tricky day			0
' this is as tough off the tee as i think i 've ever seen this golf course			0
obviously it was very low scoring here last year ( @entity86 won on 24 under par )			0
the rough was fairly thick last year , but it played so much softer and effectively , the fairways played wider and the greens were so much more receptive			0
' @entity8 failed to advance to the knock - out stages in the defence of his @entity94 title last month , but finished joint 16th in the @entity96 on sunday and believes he is well placed to take advantage of the lucrative events at the end of the season			1
' this stage of the season has always been a part of the season i 've enjoyed , ' the 35 - year - old said			1
' i think historically i 've played five , six , seven in a row this time of the year and i 've kind of prepared myself for this stage of the year			0
' the only stage of the season that i struggle with at the minute is that end of august , september period when they are giving away a lot of money in the @entity112 ( in the @entity114 play - offs )			2
that 's been the hard part of the season for me the last four years			0
@entity8 of @entity118 plays his second shot in to the ninth hole in @entity7 @entity121 takes early lead in @entity123 @entity125 's @entity124 ( above ) is also in contention after coming in at three - under par in his first round ' but this part of the season , i typically take three or four weeks off in or around the @entity1 and prepare myself for this and i 've normally played fairly well			1
' @entity8 had strapping on his left wrist but was quick to allay any injury fears , adding : ' it 's nothing sinister			1
it 's just a result of some stuff i 'm working on in my swing at the minute , especially my short game			0
i 'm really trying to throw the club head hard at the ball and it 's putting more strain in my left wrist than i 'm used to			0
' @entity124 's 69 was matched by @entity145 's @entity144 to ensure the pair shared second place with @entity149 @entity148 and @entity16 trio @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			0
it continued @entity155 champion @entity124 's impressive record at the venue			0
' it 's a good start and i really enjoy playing here anyway , ' said @entity124 , who shot a final round of 63 on his way to victory in 2011 and also holds the course record of 62			1
' even when i was at level par today i just kept telling myself , you enjoy the golf course so much , and you will have plenty of birdie chances , so you just need to wait			0
fortunately today on the back nine , it turned out well			0
' @entity170 and last year 's runner - up @entity171 were among an 11 - strong group on two under par which included world number two @entity177 and @entity42 , while @entity178 had to settle for a level - par 72			2
@entity145 @entity179 walks with his caddie @entity180 on the second hole			0

@entity0 only four off the lead in @entity7 , but loses his control
was heard on television saying ' @entity31 f * * * * * * three - putt you f * * * * * * f * * * * t '
his playing partner @entity8 leads after round one on five - under
