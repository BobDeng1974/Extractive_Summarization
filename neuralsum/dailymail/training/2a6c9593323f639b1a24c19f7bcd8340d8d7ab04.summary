the @entity0 is helping dozens of its top stars to avoid paying full income tax			1
it employs the tv and radio presenters through ‘ personal service companies ’ that allow them to minimise their contributions to the exchequer			1
the deals also allow the corporation to sidestep millions of pounds in national insurance			1
worrying : the @entity0 is helping dozens of its top stars to avoid paying full income tax , it has emerged in a grilling by @entity13 yesterday , @entity0 finance chief @entity11 admitted that 148 of the broadcaster ’s 467 presenters – nearly a third – were paid ‘ off the books ’			1
@entity17 , chairman of the commons public accounts committee , said the scale of the legal tax dodge was shocking			0
‘ the @entity0 is funded through the taxpayer and licence fee			2
it makes it entirely unacceptable for anybody to be on a contract that is in any way avoiding tax , ’ added the @entity22 mp			0
last night @entity29 announced it would step up its investigations into personal service companies			1
the @entity0 insisted the arrangements were standard industry practice but yesterday agreed to review how it pays its big names			2
the 148 stars are among 25,000 freelance contractors working for the corporation			0
concerns : dozens of household names - thought to include @entity41 , left , and @entity42 , right , are employed through one - man - band companies , which can minimise their tax bills mrs @entity17 said it was wrong that the @entity0 allowed tax arrangements that did not seem ‘ morally right ’			1
she rejected the idea that the stars were freelances , adding : ‘ a lot of people i think are probably on these contracts are the face of the @entity0 and therefore to pretend that they are anything other than pretty permanent features on our television screens and on the radio is pretty naive			1
’ controversial : in a grilling by @entity13 yesterday , @entity0 finance chief @entity11 , pictured , admitted that 148 of the broadcaster 's 467 presenters , nearly a third , were paid ' off the books ' dozens of household names are employed through the one - man - band companies , which both minimise their tax bills and let bosses off the hook for national insurance contributions			1
stars benefiting are thought to include @entity41 and @entity42			0
they have set up companies through which they channel their earnings			0
instead of paying the 50p top tax rate they can , with careful financial planning , get away with a lower corporation tax rate			2
someone with a personal services company would be liable to corporation tax of 20 per cent on profits of up to £ 300,000 in a tax year			1
above this profits are taxed at up to 24 per cent			0
the @entity0 is accused of encouraging the arrangement because it pays less national insurance			1
the practice also means that thousands of freelancers who do not have glamorous jobs or high wages are not afforded the same protection , holiday or sick pay as full employees			0
miss @entity95 , whose pay packet of £ 337,000 a year is more than double the prime minister ’s , argued that the @entity0 ’s use of freelancers was ‘ custom ’ in the industry			1
freelancers were paid a higher rate than staff , usually , to reflect that they had to pay their own tax and national insurance			1
to the incredulity of the committee , miss @entity95 denied that the @entity0 was trying to reduce its tax bill through the arrangements			2
‘ i emphasise that none of this is designed to avoid tax			0
that is not why we use an extensive number of freelance contracts at the @entity0 , ’ she insisted			2
miss @entity95 did agree to a demand from mps to review the way it employs its workers , however , and admitted that there seemed to be serious concerns			0
she said 12,000 interim staff were on the low - tax contracts			0
mrs @entity17 revealed that one long - term presenter was threatened by the @entity0 with a very substantial pay cut unless he agreed to use a private service company			2
cut backs : the @entity0 will broadcast fewer original tv dramas and more and more repeats as it continues to be crippled by spending cuts the unnamed whistleblower , who had been with the corporation for more than 20 years , was told to go freelance			1
mrs @entity17 said he had been bullied , adding : ‘ he was told he would not be employed unless he did that and when he asked for that to be put in writing that was refused to him			0
‘ he was told by the person whom he was negotiating with – he works full - time with the @entity0 , has no other employment , has been on his contract for probably getting on for 20 years – “ do n’t worry , if you have a service company @entity29 is much less likely to investigate you ”			1
’ she added : ‘ i have absolutely no reason whatsoever to think that he was telling me anything other than the truth			0
’ miss @entity95 pledged to investigate , adding that the @entity29 had been kept informed at every stage			0
she argued that the @entity0 would be unable to reduce presenters ’ salaries by the desired 25 per cent without the use of service companies			1
she was unable to guarantee that the 148 ‘ off the books ’ presenters had paid the proper amount of tax , saying she could not comment on individuals ’ tax affairs			2
but miss @entity95 pointed to a tax law aimed at freelancers , known as @entity165 , which is aimed at ensuring the same tax is paid by people working through personal service companies as well as by full - time employees			1
in the same commons session , @entity29 chief @entity170 admitted that tax inspectors had investigated just 23 personal service companies			1
she pledged to increase the number of investigations ‘ ten-fold ’ over the next year			2
the @entity177 recently revealed that some 2,400 senior @entity179 workers earning more than £ 58,000 a year are not being paid under @entity180 but through limited companies			2
earlier this year it was disclosed that the head of the @entity184 , @entity185 , was being paid via a personal service company			1
until february , he received his pay packet without deductions for tax or national insurance			1
an outcry over the arrangements led to a review of public sector pay			0
meanwhile , the @entity0 ’s annual report yesterday revealed that more than half of all @entity198 shows are repeats			0
the channel ’s re-run rate was 55 per cent in the 12 months to april , compared with almost 50 per cent the previous year			0
in the daytime , it is airing archive shows and more recent repeats , with most original shows moving over to @entity206			0
@entity206 has a repeat level of 33.1 per cent , up from 32.5 per cent in the previous year , the annual report shows			0
at peak time , 8.4 per cent of its shows are re-runs compared with 31 per cent for @entity198			0
@entity212 is airing less tv drama on its flagship channel and replacing it with more repeats from the archives .			0

the @entity0 employs the tv and radio presenters through ‘ personal service companies ’ that allow them to minimise contributions to the exchequer
the deals also allow the corporation to sidestep millions of pounds in national insurance
