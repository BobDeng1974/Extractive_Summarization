a @entity1 military analyst has said that his country should develop weapons that can cause a nightmare scenario of tsunamis and volcano eruptions in the @entity7 , potentially killing hundreds of millions			1
@entity8 , who writes a column for the @entity10 , wrote earlier this month that @entity1 needed new ' megaweapons ' to unleash chaos and guarantee destruction of its enemies			2
in an article titled ' @entity17 ' he said that @entity1 should develop nuclear weapons manned by a small force that can cause tsunamis on the @entity7 coasts and force a volcano in @entity23 to erupt			1
he references @entity53 's impact on @entity54 and says that detonating nuclear bombs near the bottom of the ocean would create waves almost a mile high that would sweep inland			0
the military man says that all the seismic activity could release another wave that would wipe out the @entity7 's @entity64 allies			1
@entity8 , the president of the @entity65 , says that @entity1 's large inland territory in @entity67 will protect it from receiving too much harm			0
he raises the stakes for the apocalyptic scenario even further by saying that the tsunami could trigger the @entity72 , a supervolcano that last exploded 640,000 years ago			0
triggering the @entity72 , which has n't erupted in 640,000 years , would spread ash across the country			0
above , a map from the @entity76 predicts the amount of ash from the blast @entity8 says that triggering the supervolcano at @entity23 would cover most of the @entity7 in ash and serve as an asymmetric weapon			1
above , @entity83 at the park the explosion would then unleash feet of volcanic ash over all of the @entity7			2
according to @entity8 , @entity1 could also trigger just the volcano with a ' relatively small ' megaton blast because it has shown signs of activity			1
@entity8 said that the normal nuclear deterrent was not good enough and too expensive given @entity1 's economic problems			2
while he is convinced of his idea , it remains to be seen if the tsunami and the litany of destruction that followed would be even be possible if the world came to nuclear war			0
the journal that the analyst writes for is a niche publication with less than 2,000 fans on the @entity1 social network @entity104			0
he may not have the ear of president @entity107 , but @entity8 has a history of making attention - grabbing statements about @entity1 military affairs for state - backed media			0
@entity8 said that his new nuclear deterrent idea could be deployed from one ship and could be ready within ten years			2
he has imagined potential war between the @entity7 and @entity1 before , telling the @entity115 that military games in eastern @entity1 north of @entity118 were ' intended to simulate a response to a hypothetical attack by @entity118 and @entity7 forces			0
' his other articles in @entity123 repeatedly call for bigger and more powerful weapons for the @entity1 military and he has bemoaned @entity1 's lack of military spending compared to the @entity7 , according to the @entity128			0
@entity8 said that detonating nuclear bombs on the ocean floor could generate deadly tsunamis and cause massive damage to the @entity7 population			1
above , devastation after the 2011 tsunami that hit @entity118 state - run television presenter @entity136 ( pictured receiving an award at the @entity138 ) said last year that @entity1 is ' the only country in the world capable of turning the @entity7 into radioactive dust ' @entity1 ' once positive views of @entity7 have slid sharply since the beginning of rising tensions between @entity144 and @entity145 over @entity146 and @entity147			1
in january 81 per cent of residents said they had a very bad or generally bad view of the @entity7			0
imagining @entity7 turned to ashes is a frightening thought , though @entity8 's article was not the first time that it had been floated recently in @entity1			2
during the beginning of the @entity147 crisis and @entity1 's annexation of @entity157 , state - run television presenter @entity136 said that president @entity159 's gray hair was because of worries about @entity1 nuclear weapons			1
he said that @entity1 was ' the only country in the world capable of turning the @entity7 into radioactive dust			1

@entity8 wrote that @entity1 needs a new ' asymmetric ' weapon
he says detonating nuclear weapons on *seafloor* would unleash tsunamis
seismic activity would trigger volcano , pour feet of ash over the @entity7
he says tsunamis could affect 240 million @entity7 and hit @entity64 too
analyst says new weapons could be ready within 10 years
tv presenter *previously* said @entity1 could turn @entity7 to ' radioactive dust '
