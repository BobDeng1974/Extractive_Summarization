@entity0 was joined by his coach @entity4 as he fine - tuned his game ahead of his second - round game on wednesday			1
the 2013 winner brushed aside @entity8 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 in the opening match on @entity10 on monday			1
meanwhile , @entity11 hopes @entity0 ’s partnership with new coach mauresmo will prove to be a long - term arrangement			1
in action : @entity0 practiced at @entity1 with his coach @entity4 on tuesday stretch : @entity0 was put through his paces on the practice courts at @entity19 on tuesday @entity0 has hired the @entity20 initially for the grass - court season but both have already stated their intention to work together for longer			1
@entity4 has so far been even more of a high - profile appointment than her predecessor @entity25 , who guided @entity0 to his first two grand slam titles in their two and a half years together			2
@entity11 told @entity27 : ' i think it ’s certainly an interesting choice			2
i think the timing of it is not that straightforward , coming in at this time of year , trying to build that relationship when the eyes of the world are on them both			0
' but i certainly do hope it works , because the continuity for him is really important , so i think they should stick together for a good while now			0
chopping and changing i do n’t think is so good for him in the long - run , so fingers crossed it works out well			0
' backing : @entity0 won his first match against @entity8 in straight sets on monday lighter moment : the @entity20 shows off her football skills ( left ) and shares a joke with @entity0 ( right ) task : the @entity53 no 1 will take on @entity3 in his second - round match on wednesday @entity0 ’s decision to choose a female coach , the highest - profile male player ever to do so , has been the talk of tennis over the past two weeks			1
most people have been positive about the appointment but there have been dissenters , most notably fellow former @entity1 champion @entity64			2
' the only things he can control are preparation and performance , ' said @entity11			2
' what ’s been talked about in the press , on the television and radio , people ’s opinions on his new coach , he ca n’t control that , so there ’s no point in worrying about that			0
' coming back as defending champion , it ’s massively exciting for everyone			0
i think the draw ’s been favourable to him , there are a few tricky ones out there , but on the whole he ’s got a pretty good section			0
victory : @entity0 celebrates his 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 victory over @entity8 on @entity10 on monday like what you see ? @entity4 was all smiles in @entity0 's box on @entity10 on monday ' but again that means nothing - he ’s got to go out and earn that favourable draw			1
he was able to do that last year and hopefully he can get on a roll again this year			0
' @entity0 's second - round opponent @entity99 , 23 , only began playing on the tour full - time this season after studying at university in @entity103 and broke into the top 100 for the first time last month			1
the @entity105 cited playing @entity106 at @entity107 ’s two weeks ago as his biggest match before @entity1 and the prize of playing the home champion gave him an extra incentive in his first - round match against @entity113			2
