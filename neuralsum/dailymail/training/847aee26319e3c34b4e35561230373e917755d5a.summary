a man *randomly* punched three people in the face on saturday afternoon in @entity6
the attacks were *unprovoked* and *unexpected*
one was caught on a store 's *security* camera , showing a man walking up behind a couple and punching the man in the head
police say the attacks are not likely to be a part of the ' knockout game ' that *involves* punching strangers and recording it
the man appeared to be under the *influence* of something or mentally ill , say investigators
he shouted unintelligibly at victims before hitting them
he also tried to hit a chef in a local restaurant but was chased from the scene
no arrests have yet been made
