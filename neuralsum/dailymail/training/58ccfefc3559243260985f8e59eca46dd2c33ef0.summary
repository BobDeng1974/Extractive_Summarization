the president of @entity1 has tried to re-write history by claiming @entity4 explorers beat @entity5 to discovering @entity6 by more than 300 years			1
@entity7 said saturday that @entity9 sailors found the @entity10 in 1178 and built a mosque on @entity12 - and even said @entity5 saw it when he showed up in 1492			1
his theory - which is not supported by most historians - came to light in a televised speech during an @entity19 summit of @entity21 leaders from @entity6			2
theory : @entity7 , the @entity1 president , made the claims saturday at a meeting with @entity6 leaders he brought up the supposed connection in a bid to establish a long history for links between his country and the distant continent			1
he said : ' contacts between @entity6 and @entity9 date back to the 12th century			0
@entity21 discovered @entity6 in 1178 , not @entity5			2
' @entity4 sailors arrived in @entity6 from 1178			1
@entity5 mentioned the existence of a mosque on a hill on the @entity12 coast			2
' explorer : @entity5 is pictured above arriving in @entity6 and claiming the land for the @entity41 royal family in 1492 he even offered to build a mosque in the country - which currently does not have any			1
@entity7 said : ' i would like to talk about it to my @entity12 brothers			0
a mosque would go perfectly on the hill today			0
' the notion that @entity5 mentioned a mosque in his diary , first floated in 1996 , is widely understood to be a misunderstanding			0
instead , the passage in question is thought to be metaphor which describes the shape of the land			0
as a @entity59 , @entity5 would have been very familiar with @entity9 architecture as @entity21 still ruled parts of @entity41 during his lifetime .			0

@entity64 @entity7 made claim in a speech to @entity6 leaders
@entity4 sailors landed in 1178 - *trumping* @entity5 in 1492
claims @entity5 wrote about a mosque he saw in @entity12 on his travels
@entity76 thought to be based on a misunderstanding - few *scholars* support it
