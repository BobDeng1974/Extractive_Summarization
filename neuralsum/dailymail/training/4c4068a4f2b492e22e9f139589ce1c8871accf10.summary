almost two in three adults and one in three children are overweight			0
public health minister @entity56 said it is time for a standard traffic light system to replace the current confusing mix of nutrition labels the labels will also carry figures to identify the level of fat , salt and sugar in terms of grams and as a percentage of the so - called ‘ reference intake ’ – the recommended daily maximum for adults			1
while the system will identify processed food , red warnings will also appear on choices such as salmon , cheese , full fat milk and some meat , because they are high in fat even though they contain important nutrients			1

and @entity108 of which ? added : ‘ with levels of obesity and diet - related disease on the increase , it ’s vitally important that people know what is in their food			1
’ @entity35 ’s boss @entity119 said the industry has a ‘ once - in - a - lifetime ’ chance to take a consistent approach , but @entity123 , of the @entity124 , said the government should have made the labelling compulsory			2
‘ the problem we have is that 40 per cent of food will not be covered by the new label and that will create confusion , ’ he said			0
‘ also we have a situation where foods which are important for health , such as oily fish , cheese or milk will get a red label , which is internationally understood as a warning to steer clear			2
‘ i would have preferred a series of shades of red to make the scheme reflect this			0
