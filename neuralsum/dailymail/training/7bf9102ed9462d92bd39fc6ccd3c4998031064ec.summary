by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 05:14 est , 18 october 2013 @entity2 should be ashamed of the way it treats grandparents , @entity1 will say today			1
the health secretary will warn a million elderly are left forgotten and isolated because friends and relatives fail to visit them			1
citing the example of @entity12 nations , he will say families should take more responsibility for grandparents and not leave caring to the state			1
mr @entity1 , who has a @entity18 wife , will say he is struck by the reverence and respect for the elderly in the @entity22			1
health secretary @entity1 ( left ) will warn today that a million elderly are left forgotten and isolated because friends and relatives fail to visit them			1
( woman , right , posed by model ) ‘ in those countries , when living alone is no longer possible , residential care is a last rather than a first option , ’ he will say in a hard - hitting speech			1
‘ and the social contract is stronger because , as children see how their own grandparents are looked after , they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old			1
‘ if we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society , we must learn from this			1
‘ it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents			1
each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship			1
a forgotten million who live among us – ignored to our national shame			1
’ mr @entity1 will make clear that some families have no option but to put older relatives in residential or nursing care and should not be ‘ condemned for taking that difficult decision ’			1
mr @entity1 will give his speech at the @entity56 conference in @entity57 , @entity58 , saying ‘ entering old age should not involve waving goodbye to one ’s dignity ’			1
he will add : ‘ according to the campaign to end @entity64 , there are 800,000 people in @entity66 who are chronically lonely			2
mr @entity1 will make clear that some families have no option but to put older relatives in residential or nursing care and should not be ' condemned for taking that difficult decision '			1
posed by models ‘ some five million people say television is their main form of company – that ’s 10 per cent of the population			1
‘ we know there is a broader problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society			2
’ the health secretary will also hit out at cases of abuse in care homes and pledge to beef up inspection of both public and private sector homes			2
‘ 112,000 cases of alleged abuse were referred by @entity66 councils in 2012/13 , the majority involving over- 65s , ’ he will say			2
‘ something is badly wrong in a society where potentially one thousand such instances are happening every single week			2
‘ which is why i am delighted that this year , for the first time , we have appointed a chief inspector of social care , @entity101			2
like all our new chief inspectors , she will act as a champion of the people who use the services – the nation ’s whistleblower - in - chief			2
’ at the same conference , health minister @entity107 yesterday announced plans for tougher inspection checks to clamp down on rushed 15 - minute care visits , which risk stripping people of their dignity			2
he said that , from april , the @entity116 watchdog is likely to be tasked with looking at whether home care visits are long enough to respond to people ’s needs			2
and inspectors will also consider looking at how working conditions might be impacting on care			2
‘ the current approach to home care is not fair on those who need support , it ’s not fair on care workers and it is stripping away the human element , ’ he said			0
‘ fifteen minutes is not enough time to help people who are older or who have a disability to do everyday things like wash , dress and get out of bed			0
some do not even get the chance to have a conversation with their home care worker , who may be the only person they see that day			0
@entity101 , the new chief inspector of social care , will act as a champion of the people who use the service ‘ these tougher checks would ask specific questions about the amount of time allocated for visits and whether staff are suitably supported to do this			0
' this is particularly important because these are services delivered in private , behind closed doors			0
i want to build a fairer society , and that means providing better care in care homes , and in people ’s own homes			0
’ last night , @entity164 , a director of the charity @entity165 , called for a ‘ seismic shift ’ in attitudes toward older people and ageing			0
she added : ‘ as we get older , we are more likely to suffer illness and disability which can prevent us from getting out and about , and people ’s social networks often shrink due to life - changing events such as retirement and bereavement which can increase the risk of becoming lonely			0
' at @entity165 we are extremely concerned that cuts to local authority budgets are exacerbating the problem of loneliness because they are causing the closure of many support services for older people , like lunch clubs , which can be a lifeline for those on their own			0
‘ these cuts are also pushing to breaking point many families who are trying to care for their older relatives in the absence of adequate support			1
' caring is often a 24/7 role that can have a huge physical and emotional impact on the carer			1
’ inspiration : @entity1 with his wife @entity199 the wife who taught @entity1 @entity18 's way of caring for the old @entity1 became interested in the @entity12 way of caring for the elderly after marrying a @entity18 woman			1
the health secretary met @entity199 five years ago at a conference in @entity208 where she was working as a recruiter for @entity18 students			0
her parents often travel to @entity2 and he is learning their language , @entity213			0
‘ it ’s quite halting , but my parents - in - law do n’t speak @entity66 and so i get a chance to practise with them , ’ he said last summer			0
three in ten @entity18 families have grandparents living in the same household and @entity220 , who taught about the importance of the family and the need to respect your elders , is still a big influence in the country			1
in traditional society , it is considered shameful for children to refuse to look after their parents			0
the vast majority of elderly people would live with one of their children , with very few living alone			1
old people ’s homes were once virtually unknown			0
confucian beliefs encourage the younger generation to respect their elders for their wisdom , and most important decisions are traditionally made by consulting them			0
there is less of a culture of youth in @entity18 , with younger people expected to defer to older people , let them speak first , sit down after them and not contradict them			0
however , in recent years , things have been changing in some of the growing cities – with fewer believing they have to look after their elders			0
as the middle class expands , many of them find they have little time to care for their parents			0
a poll has found that around a quarter of @entity18 senior citizens now live alone – something that would once have been unforgivable			0
mr @entity1 , 46 , who is the @entity263 - educated son of an admiral , spent much of his twenties in @entity266 and may have learned about their reverence for the elderly during his time there			1
described as ‘ ferociously bright ’ , his wife comes from the city of @entity274 in north - east @entity18 , near the site of the famous @entity276			0
the couple divide their time between @entity208 and his constituency of @entity281			0
they have two children : @entity284 , three , and @entity285 , one .			0

@entity1 will today warn a million elderly are left forgotten because friends and relatives fail to visit them
citing example of @entity12 nations , he will say families should take more responsibility for grandparents and not leave caring to the state
