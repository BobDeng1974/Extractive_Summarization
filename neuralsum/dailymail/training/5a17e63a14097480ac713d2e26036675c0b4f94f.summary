you smiled at her and she said : " hi , @entity70 , that 's my mom			2
" then she had you			2
' ' you could have shifted uncomfortably in your seat			2
you could have ignored her			2
you could have given me that ' smile ' that i despise because it means ; ' manage your child please			2
' ' you did none of that			2
you engaged @entity17 in conversation and you asked her questions about her turtles			2
' mrs @entity10 detailed in her letter , titled ' @entity70 ' in @entity83 from @entity84 ' , how traveling with her autistic toddler can often be difficult			1

@entity17 was diagnosed with autism in july 2012 after her mother noticed her speech and motor skills were not developing as they should have been ' they asked if she had an interactive attention span and again she did not			0
they asked many more questions and i tried to craft my answers so that they could not nail down a diagnosis			0
' [ my husband , @entity186 ] still had hope , until the very last minute when the doctor walked into the room , sat down and said : " @entity17 has autism spectrum disorder			0
" have no idea what she said after that			0
' i held it together a little bit until i walked in and saw my mom and my brother			0
