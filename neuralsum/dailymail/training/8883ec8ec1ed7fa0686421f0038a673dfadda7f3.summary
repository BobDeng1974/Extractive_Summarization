by @entity0 published : 20:07 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 04:34 est , 11 march 2014 the rise of the party , headed by @entity4 , has been attributed to voter dissatisfaction with the three main parties and immigration issues @entity9 could attract 30 per cent of the vote if it can get its act together , a major new study of the party claims today			1
the academic study , which analysed the views of more than 100,000 voters , says support for @entity9 is driven not just by @entity16 , but also by ‘ hostility ’ to immigration and ‘ intense dissatisfaction ’ with the three main parties			1
it suggests that almost one - third of voters share at least two of these values and might be persuaded to vote for the party in future if it can succeed in getting its message across			2
the study also finds that @entity9 ’s potential support has increased since the start of the financial crisis , with public dissatisfaction growing about the way the main parties have handled immigration			1
the report ’s co-author dr @entity37 , of the @entity39 , said : ‘ @entity9 are currently winning over one voter in ten but their potential far exceeds their current support in the polls by a margin of three to one			1
this revolt has been a long time coming , but may have a long way to run			0
’ the new study also suggests that @entity9 ’s supporters have been ‘ deeply misunderstood ’ , with the party now attracting growing support from working class voters			1
the findings are drawn from a new book on the party by dr @entity37 and @entity56 , of the @entity57			2
dr @entity56 said : ‘ @entity9 are winning over the “ @entity63 ” groups in @entity61 society - old , working class , men , with very few educational qualifications			1
these are voters who hold a very different set of values to the professional , middle - class majority - they are far more nationalist , @entity16 , fiercely opposed to immigration and feel like they have no voice in politics			0
they look out at a country their neither recognise nor want to be a part of			0
the study also warns that the party faces a series of major challenges , including a demographic timebomb resulting from the fact it has ' little appeal to university graduates , the young or ethnic minorities ' ‘ @entity16 gets ( @entity4 ) @entity4 through the door , but to close the deal he needs to also tap into voter concerns about immigration and their dissatisfaction with our mainstream politics			1
’ but the study warns that the party faces a series of major challenges , including a demographic timebomb resulting from the fact it has ‘ little appeal to university graduates , the young or ethnic minorities ’			1
the findings come as @entity9 comes under pressure over its voting record and the eccentric - and sometimes extreme - views of some of its leading members			1
the senior @entity103 backbencher @entity102 last week described some @entity9 supporters as being ‘ literally akin to @entity105 ’			1
but the authors of the new report argue that political and media attacks on the eccentric views of some leading figures have little impact on its support			0
@entity9 's @entity114 headquarters in @entity115 , @entity116			2
one former employee yesterday described the atmosphere there as ' extraordinary ' ‘ the average @entity9 voter thinks these attacks are all an establishment stitch - up , ’ dr @entity37 said			2
the new book says that @entity125 has proved to be a ‘ significant recruiting sergeant ’ for @entity9 , with ‘ dislike of @entity130 ’ also a growing factor in the party ’s popularity			1
@entity9 leader @entity4 last night said the research contradicted popular stereotypes about the party ’s supporters			1
in an article in the @entity137 he wrote : ‘ the point is that the idea of @entity9 fishing for votes predominantly from the @entity103 pond is plain wrong			2
' to listen to received wisdom inside the @entity146 bubble you would think the typical @entity9 voter is a retired half - colonel living on the edge of @entity149			2
if there was ever anything in that stereotype there certainly is n’t any longer			0
’ * @entity9 ’s head office is a disorganised ‘ freak show ’ , @entity4 ’s wife has told friends			2
reports yesterday claimed that @entity159 has been taken aback by the eccentric atmosphere at the party ’s @entity114 headquarters			0
mrs @entity159 , who earns up to £ 30,000 from the public purse as one of her husband ’s assistants , is said to have told colleagues that the party @entity168 is a ‘ work environment that takes some getting used to ’ and described it privately as a freak show			0
one senior adviser to mr @entity4 sometimes brings her pet cat to work , others play juvenile games in the office and one official has been known to sit with an ‘ @entity181 ’ wire massage device on her head			0
one former employee yesterday described the atmosphere as ‘ extraordinary ’ , adding : ‘ everybody has been out with everyone else			0
there are animals in the office , people taking their clothes off ... there are no sanctions			0
’ but another insider said the reports were overblown			0
‘ we have fun while working , ’ he said			0
‘ someone brings a cat to work , people like to jape in the office			0

report says party could gain more of a *foothold* among *electorate*
but study also warns of ' demographic timebomb ' facing @entity9
