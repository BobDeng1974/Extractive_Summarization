@entity0 is adamant that @entity2 co-chairman @entity1 agreed with him that they should sign @entity4 over @entity5 in 2013			1
the @entity2 boss admitted that the club could have signed the 26 - year - old @entity8 international - who is currently being targeted by @entity11 - for just £ 8m before he joined @entity12 , but instead chose @entity4 , whose time at the club has so far been blighted by injury			1
@entity0 , however , has denied recent claims by @entity1 that they chose to spend £ 15m on the @entity17 striker instead on his insistence , telling the @entity19 that it was a joint decision			2
@entity12 striker @entity5 has been targeted by @entity11 this transfer window @entity4 's @entity2 career has been largely blighted by injury since his £ 15m move ' @entity5 is a player who could have come to us a couple of seasons back			1
' @entity1 has said recently that he could have signed him for £ 8m but that i wanted @entity4			2
' my recollection was that , yes , we knew about @entity5 but we all agreed to go for @entity4 — with the caveat that if the deal did n’t work out for any reason , we would switch to @entity5			0
' @entity2 are set to travel to the @entity34 to face @entity5 's @entity12 side on saturday , although the @entity8 striker will be absent on @entity38 duty			2
the 26 - year - old was the @entity40 's top goalscorer in 2014 , bagging 20 during the calendar year , but @entity0 has insisted he has no regrets over signing @entity4 instead			0
@entity0 says the decision to sign @entity4 over @entity5 was a joint decision @entity2 co-chairman @entity1 has said recently that the club signed @entity4 on @entity0 's insistence ' whatever anyone says now , at the time a bid for @entity5 , unproven in @entity17 football , would have represented a bigger risk than @entity4 , an established @entity40 player			1
' the likelihood of achieving success , had we signed @entity5 , was far less than with @entity4			0
hindsight is a wonderful thing but , at the time , we were looking at these two possibilities			0
' in my experience over more than two decades in football management , you always have to minimise the risk			0
