by @entity0 published : 18:07 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 22:35 est , 10 october 2013 airline industry insiders say the next 9/11 style attack is already being planned and that they ’ve seen in - flight ‘ probes ’ being conducted by terrorist groups to test security			1
the @entity6 recently released a memo internally about ‘ several cases recently throughout the ( airline ) industry of what appear to be probes , or dry runs , to test our procedures and reaction to an in - flight threat			2
’ now other unions and even one concerned air marshal are speaking out about the threat and about what they say is government reluctance to do something about it			0
safe ? the @entity6 believes that terrorist ' dry runs ' are occurring across the industry as groups plot the next 9/11 style attack ‘ foolish , ’ is what @entity27 , a pilot for @entity28 and chairman at the @entity30 , calls anyone who is n’t eternally vigilant about preventing the next attack			1
@entity27 , like the @entity6 union , believes an attack could well be in the works			1
‘ 100 % , no question in my mind			2
they 're going to try it again , ’ he told @entity37			0
part of what scares the unions are events like the one that occurred on @entity6 flight 1880 on september 2 of this year as it flew from @entity50 to @entity51			1
the next 9/11 ? industry insiders like @entity27 of the @entity30 say the the next attempt at a 9/11 style attack is likely in the works			2
‘ if a dry run 's occurring , the attack is shortly following , ' he said in their memo , the @entity6 describes commotion started by a ‘ @entity62 ’ man who bolted from his seat toward the flight deck			1
face of evil : @entity65 helped plot the 9/11 attacks and was part of a group who staked out planes in @entity71 , in what may have been ' dry runs ' just a month before the @entity74 went down at the last moment , he turned and entered the lavatory			2
he stayed there for ‘ a considerable length of time			0
’ meanwhile , his three cohorts began ‘ generally making a scene , ’ in what the union believes was an attempt to distract or otherwise keep the flight crew occupied			0
according to @entity37 , a similar dry run occurred in august of 2001 , just before the september 11 attacks			1
actor @entity87 complained to flight attendants of a commotion on the plane			0
it was later revealed that @entity92 9/11 hijacker @entity65 had shaken down @entity87 ’ flight before takeoff and the men he complained about were some of the minds behind 9/11			0
the union memo mentions ‘ several cases , ’ and both @entity98 and the @entity99 confirmed the disturbance aboard flight 1880			1
however , the @entity99 said the event warranted no further investigation			2
they 're flat out liars , ’ said the marshal , who insisted the flight 1880 incident has serious safety implications			0
‘ we 're waiting for the next 911 to happen			0
it ’s not a question of if , it ’s a question of when			0
‘ if a dry run 's occurring , ’ he said , ‘ the attack is shortly following			1

' no question in my mind ' : @entity122 chairman and @entity28 pilot @entity27 fears plans for the next attack are already *underway*
@entity99 and @entity98 confirmed an *inflight* disturbance that may have been a so - called ' dry run ' that occurred september 2
