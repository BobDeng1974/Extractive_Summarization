one of the online missives read : ' i am going to kill everyone in @entity9 on july 13 , 2014			0
' using the bogus moniker , police say the 13 - year - old suspect singled out @entity39 , a 12 - year - old classmate who suffers from leukemia			1
' [ you ] should have died , ' one of the messages sent to @entity39 read			1
the boy 's mother , @entity44 , told the @entity46 that before long , @entity39 's friends were inundated with vile messages posted on his @entity4 wall telling them to hang themselves			2
' go die with @entity39 , ' one post said			0
the threats made against the young cancer patient eventually led him to go into hiding with his father			0
@entity39 , who is now cancer - free , made national headlines last year after @entity2 defensive player @entity56 paid him a surprise visit			1
specific target : some of the most vicious @entity4 messages were addressed to @entity39 , a 12 - year - old cancer survivor who went to school with the suspect heartless : the 13 - year - old allegedly wrote to @entity39 , who is a leukemia patient , that he should have died the football star learned from a news report that the boy had named a small robot he has been using in school ‘ @entity56 ’ and came to his house to spend a few hours with @entity39 playing games			1
as news of the alarming cyber-bullying targeting the young cancer survivor and the rest of @entity9 spread around town friday , officials with @entity74 's @entity73 contacted @entity4 requesting the company to reveal the true identity of the user behind the fake ' @entity33 ’ account , @entity71 reported			1
at first , @entity4 refused to comply , claiming that the menacing messages did not rise to the level of an urgent threat			0

armed with information about the suspect ’s identity and whereabouts , police officers tracked her down to the home of a family member in @entity101 according to police , the teen lives in @entity9 and attends school in town			0
on @entity4 , she pretended to be a 14 - year - old model for the clothing store chain @entity107			1
in fear for his life : @entity44 ( right ) , @entity39 's mother , said the cyber-threats forced her son to go into hiding with his father disturbing : the teen 's friends were inundated with mean @entity4 massages from ' @entity33 ' telling them to ' go die with @entity39 ' investigators have not named the girl due to her age , and there is no word on a possible motive			2
however , a message allegedly sent to @entity39 's classmate suggested that the threats may have been made in retaliation for a slight the 13 - year - old had suffered in the second grade			1
