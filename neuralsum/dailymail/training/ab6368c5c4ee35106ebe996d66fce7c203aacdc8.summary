by @entity0 modern scouts can earn badges in cookery , circus skills and orienteering			1
but the skills demanded of a @entity7 back in 1914 were distinctly different ; as members were expected to master the arts in horseshoe fitting , know the dangers of diphtheria and slaughterhouse rules			1
the @entity14 has republished a century - old guide that shows just how much the organisation has changed over the last 100 years			1
lord @entity17 with some of his @entity18			0
the 1914 guide advised members on the finer points o blacksmith work and fireman skills for the @entity25 badge , @entity18 had to throw themselves from a height of 10ft into a net or sheet			1
but they not only had to save their own skins , they also had to carry a boy of their own size down and up 12 steps			0
the @entity36 badge demanded scouts learn how to make a horseshoe , while the @entity40 badge required scouts to kill and pluck birds for their dinner , the @entity34 reported			1
the members , were also taught how to spot the warning signs of ditheria			1
perhaps it comes as no surprise , given that during @entity50 over 50,000 scouts were trained to undertake @entity52 jobs , including acting as police messengers , firemen and stretcher bearers			1
the no - nonsense badges are a far cry from the more varied pursuits of the @entity14 today , which offers members the opportunity to learn about public relations and meteorology			1
some of the new badges launched by the @entity64 are a far cry from the vocational ones 100 years ago but whereas the emphasis was on vocational badges in 1914 , the scouts now vary practical badges such as mechanical or nautical skills with more lighthearted hobbies such as crafts			1
and while the badges may have changed , so has the historic oath , so that the membership promise can include atheists			2
the scout movement is to preserve the historic promise by its members that they will do their duty to @entity84 , its leaders announced in november			0
@entity17 's @entity85 has sold 150 million copies since 1908 , making it the fourth bestselling book of all time after @entity88 and chairman @entity90 ’s @entity89			0
there are only five countries in the world that do not have scouting – @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98			0
in the past one hundred years , over half a billion men and women have taken the @entity101			0
@entity102 helped evacuate @entity103 during @entity50 polar explorer @entity104 took two scouts with him on his final expedition to the @entity108 on the @entity109			2
source : @entity64 they bowed to pressure from secular lobbyists and offered boys and girls from atheist families the chance to make a special non-religious pledge when they sign up as @entity18			2
but new recruits will continue to make the religious promise unless they ask for the atheist version			2
scout officials said that following a 10 - month consultation ' the core scout promise remains in place and scouting remains fully committed as a movement that explores faith and religion as a core element of its programme '			2
although the @entity134 remain an all - female group , scouts have accepted girls as members since the 1970s and now have more than 77,000 girls among 537,000 members			1
the @entity101 , which dates from the foundation of the movement in 1907 , requires that new members declare : ‘ on my honour , i promise that i will do my best , to do my duty to @entity84 and to the @entity146 , to help other people and to keep the @entity148			0
’ different versions for the use of @entity151 , hindus and @entity153 have been available since 1960 , although all have included a religious reference			0
there are also versions for foreign members which allow them to pledge duty ‘ to the country in which i am now living ’ rather than to the @entity146			0
the new wording for atheists says : ‘ on my honour i promise that i will do my best to uphold our scout values , to do my duty to the @entity146 , to help other people and to keep the @entity148			0

the @entity36 badge taught scouts how to make a horseshoe , while the @entity172 badge required scouts to kill birds
