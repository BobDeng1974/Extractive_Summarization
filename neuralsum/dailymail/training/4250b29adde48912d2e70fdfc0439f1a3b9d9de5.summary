even having written last week that i thought this could be a tournament too far for an ageing @entity3 team to win , i would n’t have predicted in a month of sundays the absolute thrashing they received at the hands of @entity7			1
it was an absolute beating , revenge for the 2010 final , and an outcome that nobody in their mind would have forecast , even at half - time			1
@entity19 ’s goal just before the break was absolutely critical to changing the nature of the match			2
most strikers are confidence players who like to know they ’re loved , and function better when they ’re assured of that			0
this is much more the case than with defenders or midfielders because it ’s the forwards who tend to score most and bask in the adulation that brings			0
they get used to that			0
flying @entity38 : @entity22 scored a diving header just before half - time to draw @entity7 level with @entity32 looking back to last season at @entity56 , i feel now that there were times when possibly @entity19 did n’t feel loved by @entity59			1
it ’s entirely feasible @entity19 felt @entity59 had a closer bond with @entity62 , and that he , @entity19 , was n’t on a par. management must be a minefield at times , but perhaps @entity59 should have spread the love around a bit more evenly			1
forwards can be egotistical , needing not just praise when they do well but an arm around the shoulder , a metaphorical back - rub , another pat on the back , the works			0
they ’re a delicate breed than can require some pampering ! and @entity19 is no different in that respect			2
you only had to watch his performance , in the second half at least , to see his confidence grow after that astonishing header for 1 - 1			1
top dog : under former boss @entity59 , @entity62 was often seen as the main striker at the club unloved ? @entity59 ' better relationship with @entity62 may have damaged @entity19 's confidence last season that ’s one of those goals that will look better and better as the years go by			1
i ’ve watched it a dozen times already and it ’s simply magnificent			0
@entity95 used to say that @entity19 ’s left foot was like @entity98 ’s backhand ; so extraordinarily brilliant that it looks effortless			2
he ’s the complete technician			0
and believe me , there was technique , too , in the execution of that header , getting on it the right way , at the right time , controlling it			0
revitalised : @entity22 ( left ) looked reborn in the second - half scoring another and hitting the bar ( pictured ) @entity19 had looked isolated before that ; and then wonderfully on top of his game afterwards			1
it was agame - changer			0
take away that goal and the half - time talk for @entity117 would have been an exercise in attempting to reassure his players , telling them to have patience with the game - plan			1
the goal meant , instead , they were already assured , the place buzzing , the team ready to go out and capitalise			0
as @entity128 moved up through the gears and attacked through the middle , @entity32 ’s central defenders , @entity132 and @entity133 , faltered			1
@entity134 ragged : @entity128 ( left ) gave @entity132 ( right ) and @entity133 a torrid time in the second - half it ’s absolutely crucial as part of that partnership to play as a pair , know exactly where the other person is , and what you ’re both doing			1
and from the start of the second half they looked like strangers and were opened up			2
you have to wonder now whether they will even get out of their group			0
their next match against an exciting @entity154 side is no gim me			0
still , what an unbelievable advert for the @entity158 the @entity38 provided .			2

@entity19 's late first - half equaliser against @entity32 changed the game
@entity7 went on to win 5 - 1 in their @entity164 @entity158 2014 opener
@entity22 and @entity7 looked revitalised in the second - half
@entity22 and @entity128 tormented @entity133 and @entity132
@entity22 may have lost confidence last season at @entity56
@entity62 's relationship with @entity59 may have made him feel second - fiddle in the striking playing order
