by @entity1 reporter published : 19:41 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 02:36 est , 10 march 2014 almost one million @entity3 alive today are of @entity5 descent , which means one in 33 men can claim to be direct descendants of the @entity9			1
around 930,000 descendents of warrior race exist today - despite the @entity12 ™ @entity3 rule ending more than 900 years ago			1
a genetic study carried out by @entity15 compared the y chromosome markers - @entity16 inherited from father to son - of more than 3,500 men to six dna patterns that are rarely found outside of @entity21 and are associated with the @entity9			1
vikings left behind buildings , culture and words that are still used in the @entity42 language today			1
key findings from the research include that men from the @entity29 ( 29.2 per cent ) and @entity47 ( 25.2 per cent ) islands , heavily populated by the @entity48 in the @entity49 , are most likely to have @entity5 in their bloodlines			1
@entity52 @entity51 ( 5.6 per cent ) and @entity53 ( four per cent ) are the most prominent areas of the country for @entity5 ancestry with more than 300,000 @entity53 men able to claim direct descent - accounting for almost a third of descendants			1
thanks to the recent dna data , around 930,000 people can claim to be of direct @entity5 decent further south the percentage of @entity5 descendants drops significantly , with @entity67 home to as few as 40,000 father line descendants			1
despite being a known hotspot for the @entity9 when they first landed , @entity69 has very little sign of a norse genetic contribution today , with only 1.4 per cent of men from the @entity69 thought to have @entity5 connections			1
@entity75 has a lower count of @entity5 bloodlines than any other part of @entity3 or @entity69			1
doctor @entity79 , chief scientist at @entity15 , said : ' despite arriving well over 1,000 years ago the @entity5 legacy still remains strong in @entity3 and @entity69			1
' the research suggests that the concentration of @entity9 blood is quite variable , but as the y chromosome only relates to the nationâ € ™ s male population and only to one ancestral lineage for each man , there is a very real chance that many more of us are related to the @entity9			1
' men from the far north of @entity30 were most likely to provide a direct match with almost a third ( 29.2 % ) of the men from the @entity29 testing positive for @entity5 blood legends of the @entity9 warriors have become very popular since the drama series ' @entity9 ' began airing @entity100 , creator and writer of the tv show vikings , said : ' the research demonstrates the profound effect that the @entity9 had on our country when they invaded centuries ago			1
' to think that many of us may still have the blood of these feared and famed warriors flowing through our veins so long after their reign is an incredible and profound thought			1
' the @entity5 descendant population is much more prominent up in the northern parts of the @entity116 people dressed as @entity9 carry burning brands as they take part in a @entity9 reconstruction festival 1			1
