by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:57 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 19:42 est , 16 december 2013 analogue radio has been given a stay of execution after ministers admitted too few listeners were switching to digital			1
both @entity8 and am radio were due to be turned off in 2015 , though the @entity10 had already considered a delay as digital uptake was so slow			2
but now ministers have decided to postpone the plan indefinitely after discovering that barely a third of radio is received from digital stations			2
delays : ministers will not set a date to switch of fm services until more people start using digital radios communications minister @entity24 said more needed to be done to persuade listeners to switch			1
mr @entity24 said : ‘ i regard my role as a supporter and enabler of digital radio but			1
i completely respect the people ’s passion for radio and not being made to do something they do n’t want to do			2
‘ i also have a huge amount of respect for people who run independent commercial stations			0
they ’re not flying off to the @entity40 ; these are tough organisations to run and they do n’t make a huge amount of money			0
’ ministers have refused to set a deadline until half of all radio listened to is on digital @entity47 added : ‘ we are not there yet			2
so now is not the time to switch over			0
’ mr @entity24 added a new ‘ digital certification mark ’ scheme is planned for 2014 , which aims to identify radios that meet the industry 's minimum technical and performance standards			1
in a written ministerial statement , he said : ‘ in spite of recent progress , the current rate of digital listening has not yet reached 40 per cent			0
we have always been clear that the switch to digital must be consumer - led rather than @entity10 imposed			1
‘ therefore , we do not believe that now is the time to commit to a switchover			0
nonetheless , we want to maintain the positive industry action to promote digital listening , because we know that consumers like the clearer sound and ease of tuning , not to mention the wide range of content offered			1
’ communications minister @entity24 said more people had to go digital before he would set a date for switchover digital listening includes @entity79 radio and the internet and when switchover happens it will see all existing @entity8 coverage has been replicated on @entity79 networks			1
digital switchover of television completed last year			0
just one in 20 people have a digital radio in their cars and only 40 per cent of new vehicles come equipped with them			1
converting an existing car radio to a digital one would cost around £ 100			0
less than half of households own digital radios , which start from around £ 30 but can cost more than £ 150			1
there are more than 100million analogue sets across @entity97 , which would become obsolete if the @entity8 and @entity99 frequencies were switched off			0
patchy coverage has also blighted the transmission of digital radio			1
@entity104 ’s culture spokesman , @entity103 , told the @entity105 that people did not have money for the switch , saying : ‘ in the middle of a cost - of - living crisis , this is not what people need			1
’ she added that digital take up should be closer to 75 per cent before a deadline was set			0
digital radio groups are pushing for ministers to agree a date for a switch			1
@entity118 and @entity119 have called for non-digital radio to be switched off in 2018 , as has industry body the @entity122			2
however small , independent radio stations have warned they do not have the money or staff to make the switch in a hurry			0
a coalition of 81 national , regional and local commercial radio stations was established last month to campaign against an enforced switchover			0
@entity131 , chairman of @entity132 , which is part of the coalition , said : ‘ the government ’s decision not to commit to switch over is very good news for listeners			0
‘ we have always felt that broadcasters are best placed to understand the needs of their audiences and that platform investment decisions should rest with individual radio stations			0
’ to help stations switch , mr @entity24 said the government , the @entity105 and the commercial sector would pump £ 21million into upgrading digital transmitters			1
this would improve national @entity105 digital coverage from 94 per cent to 97 per cent			0
just one in 20 people have a digital radio in their cars and only 40 per cent of new vehicles come equipped with them local transmitters , which cover both @entity105 and commercial stations , would increase their coverage from 70 per cent to 90 per cent			1
new national commercial radio stations could launch as @entity159 seeks interest to build and run a second national commercial multiplex in the new year , according to mr @entity24			2
motorists are also in line to receive better information on how to upgrade their car radio to digital and details of approved installers			0
government figures show 41.6 per cent of new cars sold in october had @entity79 radios fitted as standard , an increase from 4.4 % in 2010			2
@entity173 , chief executive of @entity118 , said : ‘ the continued growth of @entity79 means listeners will benefit from an increased choice of stations , a better radio listening experience and a certainty that they can tune in 24/7 to the best radio content on offer worldwide			2
’ although @entity97 is a leading manufacturer of digital radio sets , it lags behind @entity186 in switching over			1
@entity187 and @entity188 have already made pledges to switch off their analogue signal			0
@entity191 and @entity192 are also making moves to set @entity195 listeners will not be forced to go digital for several years after ministers warned too many people are still using analogue devices .			1

@entity24 says more must be done to persuade listeners to switch to digital
radio industry hopes for switchover to digital - only broadcasts by 2018
but just *35* % of listening is by digital devices against a target of 50 %
just one in 20 people have digital radios in their cars
