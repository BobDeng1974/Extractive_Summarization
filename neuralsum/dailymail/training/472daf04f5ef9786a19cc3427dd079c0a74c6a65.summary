a controversial new social experiment is endeavoring to interview white people all over the @entity2 in an effort to document ' their understanding of their own whiteness ' - and is causing an online furor while doing so			1
some 24 people have already been interviewed for @entity8 - all from @entity9 , @entity10 - with a goal of getting 1,000 from all parts of the country , with the resultant videos to air in packages on @entity17			1
in the first video installment to be released , a woman compares the discrimination she receives for having multiple tattoos to the judgement a black person might receive			0
' i get discriminated against just as much as a minority does , ' she said			0
' i ’m a tattoo - ed woman ... so you ca n’t put me in the same boat ( as black people )			0
' one elderly gentleman , @entity49 , says that he believes white people are now more often discriminated against than black people			1
another woman , who described herself as voluptuous , said she does n't like the reaction she gets from black men when she 's dressed provocatively			0
' when you smile and say hello ( to a black man ) , that is not an invitation to follow me and come to my door , ' the woman says in her video			0
the campaign has been furiously attacked on social media			0
critics like @entity66 from @entity67 claimed most of the white people spent their interview time ' criticizing minorities ' , @entity70 reported			1
@entity66 said the videos could ' easily be mistaken for satire where it not for the involvement of @entity17 '			2
the @entity8 is being helmed by documentary filmmaker @entity29			1
online anger : many took to @entity79 to vent over the project when it debuted is it a joke ? some people believed the video interviews were satirical and not actually serious controversial : some of the people interviewed had strange opinions on minority groups @entity29 admitted on @entity79 to having nerves about debuting the project and he was worried about people 's reactions			1
' a bit nervous as i know it has a huge chance of being misunderstood , ' @entity29 posted online			2
' white people have been very tentative about engaging			2
' ' @entity98 either get it right away or are hugely offended			0
' @entity29 has since shut down the @entity79 page for the @entity8 , which had only about 40 followers			1
he said in his artistic statement that the point of the experiment was to investigate something that has n't been explored before			0
in charge : the @entity8 is the brainchild of documentary filmmaker @entity29 ' most people take for granted that there is a “ white ” race in @entity2 , but rarely is the concept of whiteness itself investigated			1
' what does it mean to be a “ white ” ? can it be genetically defined ? is it a cultural construct ? a state of mind ? ' how does one come to be deemed “ white ” in @entity2 and what privileges does being perceived as white bestow ? ' it is unclear whether the @entity127 interviews will continue in the wake of the controversy .			2
