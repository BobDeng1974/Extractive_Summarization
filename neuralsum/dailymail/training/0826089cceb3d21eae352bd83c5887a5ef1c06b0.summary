but the grandfather is now in a permanent state of happiness – after a stroke left him unable to feel sadness			1
the stroke interfered with the part of mr @entity1 ’s brain that regulates emotional responses , leaving him liable to erupt in a fit of giggles at the most inappropriate of times			1
he has sat through funerals smiling broadly or cracking jokes , and during meals out with wife his @entity18 , 63 , he regularly attracts puzzled looks from fellow diners			0
@entity1 ( pictured with his wife , @entity18 ) , 68 , was left with little feeling in his left side after he suffered a major stroke in 2004			1
until he had the stroke he was fit and healthy but while the condition could be devastating for some , mr @entity1 said yesterday he sees his joyous disposition as a blessing			1
the 68 - year - old said : ‘ i ’ve always been a happy person and loved telling jokes , but now i do n’t ever feel sad			2
‘ i remember that i used to be able to feel sad , if something bad happened – but it just does n’t happen any more			0
he added : ‘ i would definitely rather be happy all the time than the other way round			0
’ mr @entity1 was healthy and working as a lorry driver when he was struck down with the stroke in january 2004 as he made breakfast			2
doctors told mr @entity1 , and his wife , that the stroke had hit the frontal lobe of his brain that controls emotions , and the couple realised it meant he could no longer feel sadness mr @entity1 said : ' i am never depressed			1
being sad would n't help anything anyway			0
i would definitely rather be happy all the time than the other way round			0
it 's an advantage really ' mr @entity1 spent 19 weeks in hospital after his stroke and his wife was told to prepare for the worst			1
he realised he was unwell when he tried to carry a cup of coffee upstairs and spilled it it affected the right frontal lobe – the part of the brain that controls emotions and motor function on his left side – and doctors initially feared the grandfather - of - two would not pull through			1
mr @entity1 , from @entity66 , @entity67 , spent 19 weeks in hospital and has no function in his left arm and can only walk short distances with the aid of a stick			1
the pensioner is now in the early stages of vascular dementia , triggered by a reduced blood flow to the brain following the stroke			2
mrs @entity80 and the couple ’s daughter , @entity81 , 31 , yesterday said mr @entity1 ’s condition meant he was unable to curb his happy persona , and sometimes left them feeling like they were living with a child			1
mr @entity1 's short term memory has also been affected by the stroke and he has lost his ability to judge what is , and what is not , an appropriate thing to say			1
( pictured with wife @entity18 on their wedding day			0
) but while the condition can be trying at times for the family , they said the couple ’s grandchildren , @entity102 and @entity103 , ca n’t wait to visit their ‘ hilarious ’ granddad			0
mrs @entity80 added : ‘ @entity1 does n’t cry , he just does n’t know how to be sad anymore			2
‘ but he ’s infectious			0
when he starts laughing everyone in the room does			0
‘ we have been to funerals and i ’ve been on tenterhooks wondering what he might come out with			0
’ dr @entity115 , research communications officer at the @entity116 , said : ‘ while we have n’t heard before of stroke survivors completely losing the ability to feel a particular emotion , many find it very difficult to control their emotions and may cry or laugh at inappropriate times			2
’ mr @entity1 ( pictured with his grandson , @entity103 ) loves to tell jokes			0
his daughter says that his grandchildren love his jokes and that they think he is very funny			0

@entity1 , 68 , had a stroke which affected his brain 's frontal lobe
he spent 19 weeks in hospital and lost the feeling in his left side
says that since the stroke , he ca n't feel sadness and is always happy
has also lost the ability to judge what it is , and is n't , appropriate to say
