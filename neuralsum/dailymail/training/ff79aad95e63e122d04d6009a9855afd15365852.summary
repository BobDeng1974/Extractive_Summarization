the cults of @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 continue to be formidable forces in today ’s society			1
these technology giants have employee populations larger than some small towns , and fans that are willing to pay any price to have their latest release			0
now one @entity14 - based designer has unveiled his vision of what towns designed by these @entity18 groups might look like			0
for @entity3 , mr @entity20 , has designed campus housing 9,400 staff in @entity23 , @entity24			1
it includes a number of high - rise blocks , a sky bridge over a motorway and its own train station @entity20 ’s vision focuses on @entity2 , @entity1 , @entity3 , and @entity31 , but he 's also created with a generic space to serve as a model for smaller start - ups			1
‘ the booming tech industry has created huge demand for housing in the @entity38 , driving up housing costs and leading to long commutes , ’ said mr @entity20			1
‘ meanwhile , tech workers flock to @entity38 and @entity42 , seeking the high - density urban environment that @entity18 lacks			2
this is @entity20 's vision of a @entity45 which is dedicated to @entity1 workers			1
the main office building is circular and features an @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity48			2
it also has its very own underground road network the @entity2 headquarters housing is shown in this aerial view from the east			1
mr @entity20 created the design after wondering what would happen if 10,000 @entity2 employees working at the main mountain view campus were provided with on - site housing ‘ what might it look like if tech campuses replaced their parking lots and provided all the necessary housing on - site ? ’ for @entity3 , mr @entity20 , has designed campus housing 9,400 staff in @entity23 , @entity24			1
it includes a number of high - rise blocks , a sky bridge over a motorway and its own train station			1
this is @entity20 's vision of a @entity45 which is dedicated to @entity1 workers			1
the main office building is circular and features an @entity76 , @entity50 - large slab - like buildings - and @entity75			1
it also has its very own underground road network mr @entity20 ’s notes that technology workers ' impact on housing prices is a divisive topic in the @entity38			1
the issue stems from a shortage of housing in @entity18 , which was originally research labs and electronics factories			0
now , software is dominant , and a lot more programmers can fit in the same space			0
‘ in fact , ’ he says , ‘ many do n't need a desk at all			0
’ @entity31 headquarters features a total building area of three million square feet housing five huge blocks for employees @entity2 , for instance employs 10,000 at its @entity104 headquarters			2
surprisingly , that number of apartments can fit on the parking lots and open spaces of the suburban campus			0
‘ most would be in towers of 30 to 50 floors , with the rest in lower blocks lining the site , ’ said mr @entity20			1
such a concentration of people would also create the critical mass to attract the trendy services and amenities that currently only @entity38 offers , he added			0
‘ this study assumes regular apartments , with an average of 800 sq ft per family of 2 , ’ he said			0
‘ it also assumes very limited parking			0
co-op style housing typically can get down to 200 square feet per resident , roughly double the efficiency of apartments			0
that would still be a lot of housing in one spot though			0
’ this is part of an on - going trend			0
@entity138 's @entity137 neighbourhood , for example , is planning a huge building full of micro-apartments rise in 2016 , to serve employees of @entity2 , @entity142 , @entity143 , and @entity144			2
this is what the @entity146 could look like from the northwest campus entrance in @entity1 's @entity45			1
such a concentration of people would create the critical mass to attract the trendy services and amenities that currently only @entity38 offers , said mr @entity20			1
this is a long north - south @entity156 in the @entity38 of @entity24 @entity2 employs 10,000 at its @entity104 headquarters			2
surprisingly , that number of apartments can fit on the parking lots and open spaces of the suburban campus as shown here according to a report in @entity164 , @entity165 , head of the @entity167 's @entity166 , has suggested that instead of housing tech campuses in suburban areas , the will see the tech economy give rise to innovation districts			2
mr @entity20 does n’t necessarily believe that @entity38 should be the location for these mega-tech cities			1
‘ i was thinking about what exactly are the things in @entity38 that attract people who have jobs 50 miles away and go back and forth every day , ’ mr @entity20 told @entity175 at @entity164			1
‘ and part of it 's just being around other people , being around different stores and restaurants			0
’ but many believe having a town dedicated to technology workers could create its own problems			0
not least , the choice of entertainment options on a friday night			0
this is a view from the roof of an office building in @entity45			2
mr @entity20 says that there is a shortage of housing in @entity18 , which was originally research labs and electronics factories			2
now , software is dominant , and a lot more programmers can fit in the same space			0

@entity20 wanted to show what it would look like if @entity38 companies provided employee housing on - site
