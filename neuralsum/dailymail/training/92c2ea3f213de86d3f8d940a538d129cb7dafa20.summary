yesterday , his grieving family attended the first day of a long - awaited inquest into his mysterious death			2
coroner dr @entity48 pledged to hold a ‘ full and fearless ’ inquiry as she heard : revelations about his personal life and claims that no third - party fingerprints or dna were found in his home fuelled speculation around the circumstances of his death			2
his parents , @entity60 and @entity61 , listened as his sister @entity24 told the inquest how he never spoke about his top - secret intelligence work			0

mystery : mr @entity10 was found dead locked inside a holdall in the bath of his flat ( above )			1
his family want to know why the alarm was not raised when he failed to turn up to work unsolved : coroner @entity48 has said that whether mr @entity10 was alive inside the @entity31 bag like this one and locked it himself ' was at the very heart of this inquiry ' but mrs @entity24 said he disliked the office culture at the landmark @entity7 headquarters on the south bank of the @entity87			1
she said : ‘ he missed the countryside and longed to ride his bicycle in the open air without smog and the constant fear of being run over by a bendy bus			2
‘ he disliked the office culture , post-work drinks , flash car competitions and the rat race			2
he even spoke of friction in the office			0
‘ the job was not quite what he expected			0
he encountered more red tape than he was comfortable with			0
’ mrs @entity24 said she last spoke to her brother on august 13 , when he said he was looking forward to going to see a transvestite comedian			2
brilliant : mr @entity10 , a mathematics prodigy and codes expert for @entity35 , had been on secondment with @entity7 since march 2010 she later found out he missed a meeting at @entity7 that he was due to chair , but no one investigated why			1
on august 23 pc @entity110 was asked to conduct a ‘ welfare check ’ on mr @entity10 ’s flat when he failed to keep in touch and they could not raise him			1
the officer described how the property was clean , tidy and unremarkable until he came across the holdall in the en - suite bathroom			0
@entity119 said : ‘ i noticed that the side nearest the door had a round bulge			0
‘ i noticed there was a padlock with the two zips joined together			0
at this point i am realising it is something serious			0
’ he called sergeant @entity128 , who used a knife to cut a three - inch hole in the bag , confirming a body was inside and alerting the murder squad			1
@entity134 said the heavy - duty bag concealed the smell of the decomposing body but once the hole was made the ‘ smell became more than apparent ’			2
when mr @entity10 ’s sensitive job was discovered , detectives from the force ’s @entity140 were informed			1

she said he would meticulously check his equipment before rock climbing , cycling and fell running			0
she added that her brother never told her he was being followed or felt threatened , saying : ‘ i can not think as to why anybody would want to harm him			0
’ the inquest , which is expected to last eight days , continues			0
being tracked ? mr @entity10 is caught on @entity169 in @entity170 on august 14 , 2010 , just over a week before his naked and decomposing body was found locked in a bag in his @entity28 flat suspicions : mr @entity10 ' body is taken out of his flat			1
relatives believe a third party was either present when @entity10 died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence interests : mr @entity10 was also a successful cyclist and fell runner with a passion for the arts , cinema , books and fashion , with a £ 20,000 clothing collection in his wardrobe			1

@entity10 was extremely ' security *conscious* ' and would not have let *strangers* inside his flat
he may have been considering leaving the security *services* to start up his own business
detectives say *criminal* charges are still a *possibility* , despite no *suspects*
four intelligence agents give evidence behind *anonymity* screens to avoid ' real risk of harm ' to national security and *international* relations
mr @entity10 wanted to escape the ‘ rat race ’ of the *capital* and was frustrated that @entity7 had been *dragging* its feet over the move .
the spy was extremely conscientious and his family said he would never let anyone into his flat apart from them .
@entity7 was *accused* of failing to raise the alarm when he missed a key meeting one week before his body was found .
a sergeant described the moment he cut open the red @entity31 holdall and found the body of mr @entity10 *curled* up inside .
a constable who discovered the bag and raised the alarm noticed *underwear* neatly folded on a nearby bed and a woman ’s *wig* hanging on a chair . the death of mr @entity10 in august 2010 triggered a painstaking investigation , *worldwide* media *frenzy* and a raft of *conspiracy* *theories* .
