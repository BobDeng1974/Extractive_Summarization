she agreed , and at the end of a two - week holiday @entity13 proposed			2
despite warnings from her family , miss @entity3 said yes , and used her savings to arrange the wedding in @entity5 before flying home without her new husband , as he had no @entity33 visa			1
as soon as she returned to @entity34 in @entity35 , she claims , @entity13 started bombarding her with messages asking for money			1
then , when she visited him again in @entity5 , his ardour appeared to have cooled and he insisted they sleep in separate beds			1
miss @entity3 , who claims incapacity benefit for depression , said she spent her entire life savings on @entity13 during their two - year marriage , which ended when their divorce was finalised two weeks ago			1
@entity3 said she fell in love with 22 - year - old @entity13 as the two got to know each other via an internet chat room now , however , she claims she is turning things around with the help of her new 26 - year - old @entity5 boyfriend @entity53 , saying : ‘ i know he wants me for who i am			1
’ she added : ‘ i am very happy with @entity53 and i have definitely learned from my mistake			0

‘ i did n’t mind spending the money at first			2
i was completely swept off my feet			2
’ her daughter @entity63 , 19 , warned her she was being taken for a ride but miss @entity3 ignored the advice , saying : ‘ i thought she was being silly			2
’ ms @entity3 with her new @entity5 love interest @entity53 , who she talks to online for several hours each day her new boyfriend , 26 - year - old @entity53 , is also from @entity5 and ms @entity3 says it is true love she added : ‘ @entity13 would ask me for money for things like driving lessons so he could get a job			1

@entity3 blew £ 18,000 on whirlwind marriage to 22 - year - old @entity5
was swept off her feet by him after the two started chatting on the internet
things turned sour soon afterwards with his *repeated* requests for money
but she has now healed her broken heart with another @entity5 toyboy
