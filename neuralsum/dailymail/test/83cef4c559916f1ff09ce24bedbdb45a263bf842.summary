scientists believe life on @entity2 began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago			2
but while they have been able to put a date on when life appeared , they are still far from knowing how it appeared			0
now researchers in the @entity7 and @entity8 say they have evidence that @entity11 - like fragments may have come with ' instructions ' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago			2
now researchers in the @entity7 and @entity8 say they have evidence that @entity11 - like fragments may have come with ' instructions ' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago @entity20 , which stands for ribonucleic acid , is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides			1
it is one of three major biological molecules that are essential for all known forms of life , along with dna and proteins			0
the main job of @entity20 is to transfer the genetic code to create proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome			0
this prevents the dna from having to leave the nucleus , and protects it from damage			0
it also acts as an on - and - off switch for some genes			0
the researchers believe these fragments used their innate self - evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life			1
the study , by the @entity45 and @entity46 , is based on a discovery in the 1980s that @entity20 can chemically alter its own structure			0
@entity20 is similar to @entity11 , and carries out a number of jobs in our cells , including acting as an on - and - off switch for some genes			0
scientists believe that when life was in its early stages , @entity20 played a leading role in creating complex organisms before dna and proteins were developed			1
many origin - of - life researchers say that @entity20 chains are too specialised to have been created as a product of random chemical reactions			2
the new study , however , claims to provide an alternative theory by arguing primordial dna - like fragments evolved in this way instead			2
the researchers found the self - assembly of dna fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds			1
these connect together short dna chains to form long ones , without the need for a separate biological process			1
the image shows a droplet of condensed @entity11 and within it smaller drops of its liquid crystal phase which show up in polarised light on the left			0
the liquid crystal droplets act as ' micro-reactors ' where short dna can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life ' our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early @entity2 when the first dna - like molecular fragments appeared , ' said @entity46 physics professor @entity99 , a study co-author			1
the study suggests that the way in which @entity11 emerged in the early @entity2 lies in its structural properties and its ability to self - organise			0
in the @entity111 world , the spontaneous self - assembly of fragments of nucleic acids â€“ the building block of life - may have acted as a template for their chemical self - assembly			1
' the new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions , the spontaneous self - assembly of small dna fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers , thereby providing a @entity111 route to the @entity20 world , ' added professor @entity99 .			1

scientists say early dna - like fragments guided their own growth
they claim the process can drive the formation of chemical bonds
these connect short dna chains to form long ones for life to evolve
this self - assembly *capability* has been shown to take place in @entity20
