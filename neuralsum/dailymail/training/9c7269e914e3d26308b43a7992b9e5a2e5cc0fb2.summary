dowsed in foam , dodging eggs and swigging from bottles of champagne … this is the best of young @entity6 academia			2
final year students at @entity8 poured out of an exam hall at midday yesterday to celebrate with friends			2
and following an annual tradition known as ‘ trashing ’ , they were sprayed with foam and flour as bottles of wine and champagne were cracked open			1
one is n't enough : a foam - covered student drinks from two bottles getting trashed : final year students sprayed one another with foam confetti and flour after their exams @entity26 : the students were in high spirits after the last exams of their degrees , covering one another with flour and alcohol elation : one happy student , still in academic dress , frolics through the streets of the ancient university city but just as the party kicked off , @entity39 was unveiling plans to reign in the university drinking culture			1
the @entity43 has told students not to go on pub crawls or take part in @entity47 and @entity48 drinking games and is spending £ 90,000 trying to combat the problem of excessive drinking			1
in future , student union bars – notorious for selling cheap alcohol – will be asked to compete for accredited safe drinking status and encourage a ‘ café culture ’			1
to pass , they must show they are taking action to deter binge - drinking , which will include telling young people not to participate in ‘ alcohol - related initiation ceremonies ’ , social media games or pub crawls organised by private firms			1
there has been huge controversy over ‘ @entity72 ’ events held in university towns which encourage students to go on pub crawls , often during fresher weeks			1
rejoicing : the student jumps into the arms of her waiting friends silly string : the students covered themselves in brightly - coloured decoration and carried balloons alarm has also been raised over the drinking game @entity82 , which involves people filming themselves downing alcohol			1
the trend , fuelled by videos shared on @entity48 and @entity47 , has been linked to several deaths			0
crime prevention minister @entity88 said he wants to make universities ‘ more productive places to study and live ’			0
he said that being accredited safe drinking status should become a ‘ badge of honour ’			2
he added that some students are ‘ encouraged to participate in alcohol - fuelled activities which can damage health and in some cases spill over into disorder and anti-social behaviour ’			0
student union bars must ensure soft drinks are available at the same price or lower and refuse to serve ‘ intoxicated customers ’			0
universities must also develop ‘ a café culture that runs into the evening , providing a social alternative to alcoholic spaces ’			0
warned : student celebrations in @entity8 were branded a ' disgrace ' by university proctors last year after final year exams in @entity8 last year , the celebrations were described by university proctors as ‘ a disgrace ’ because students left behind rotten food , vomit and broken glass			0
@entity120 vice-president @entity119 said cutting down on misuse of alcohol could help both student welfare and community relations			0
so far the universities that have joined the scheme are @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity131 @entity130 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 .			0
