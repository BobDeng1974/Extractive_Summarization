but mrs @entity18 's family have been left furious after a judge decided to temporarily waive the curfew order to enable @entity8 to visit @entity21 during @entity22 week			1
@entity8 , right , who killed his partner of 20 years @entity18 in a car crash on june 4 last year has been told he can go on holiday to @entity21 after a judge lifted a curfew order handed to him @entity8 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , who has never held a driving licence , lost control of his car and veered sharply off the road on june 4 last year			1
he collided head - on with a tree and mrs @entity18 , his partner of 20 years , died at the scene on the @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity29			1
@entity8 said he had been driving ' all his life ' in 42 different countries but there was no evidence of any licence records			2
after the order was imposed the judge agreed to suspend it between december 18 and december 23 to fit in with a £ 99 holiday @entity8 has booked to the seaside resort			2
@entity8 had already booked a £ 99 holiday to the seaside resort of @entity21 mrs @entity18 ’s family said the decision had compounded the anger they already felt about the sentence he had been given			1

' my poor stepmother did not deserve this			0
i feel like he has been able to get away with it			0
' a nine - month suspended sentence is nothing			1
then to add the curfew but allow him to go on holiday during it does n’t make any sense			0
' during his court case @entity8 was told mrs @entity18 died because of an ' appalling piece of driving '			2
@entity8 denied the charge of death by careless driving			1
he told the jury a piece of cardboard fell from the dashboard and obstructed his pedals , causing the engine to rev and preventing him from braking			0
but forensic examinations found nothing that would have affected the controls			0
prosecutor @entity94 said @entity8 threw ' explanations in the air like confetti in the hope they would land in the right place ' and branded his version of events as ' invention '			2
after the verdict , judge @entity104 told the court : ' anytime he got into that vehicle , or any other vehicle , he was committing a crime			0
' i do n’t think he should drive again quite frankly			0
' the judge said @entity8 had not shown ‘ any kind of remorse ’ for mrs @entity18 ’s death			2
he said : ' if you kill your partner of 25 years by a piece of driving that is pretty poor			0
do n’t you feel sorry for that ? ' @entity62 , one of mrs @entity18 's four stepdaughters , said : ' as the judge said he showed no remorse and that ’s what hurts			0
