by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 believes he is a better player now than when he was world no 1 , but the @entity4 is desperate to match his nation 's football team in managing expectations			1
@entity4 's form in recent championships has made them one of the favourites for this summer 's @entity12 in @entity13 , while @entity2 re-emerged as a major force with his victory in the @entity16 a fortnight ago			1
the 29 - year - old won the @entity18 in august 2010 and became world number one for eight weeks the following february , but believes changes to his swing have finally bedded in			2
@entity23 preparation : former world number one @entity2 has been in fine form in recent months ' i can hit any shot that i want to hit , which is important , and i did n't believe that i could do it when i was number one in the world or even when i won the @entity18 , ' @entity2 told a pre-tournament press conference ahead of the @entity32 at @entity23			1
' it was very easy for me to play golf , but it was not satisfying			2
so now i would say i 'm a more complete player			2
but it 's very important that we do n't put it in the wrong perspective now that i should play well every week			2
' obviously golf is a very difficult sport and a very important word is the expectations that a lot of people have			1
as a player i know where i can rank my expectations			1
' it 's just important that others do n't always think that we have to deliver every single week			2
the @entity4 national team are going to play the @entity12 in a few weeks and when i play with different players every week everyone says , " oh yeah , @entity4 should win "			1
' that 's a good possibility , but it does n't mean that we have to win or that you do n't keep the expectations low			1
you can only get disappointed otherwise and there 's a lot of pressure that those players have to handle			2
i think that 's what people forget sometimes			2
it 's not that easy			0
' similar expectations : @entity2 believes he needs to prepare himself in a similar way mentally to the @entity4 team @entity2 's victory at @entity70 certainly was not achieved easily , at least after the 90 - minute rain delay late in the final round			1
the @entity74 star looked to be cruising to victory until that point , but double - bogeyed the 15th when play resumed and had to hole from 30 feet for a vital par on the 17th to cling onto a one - shot lead			0
however , the manner of his triumph in golf 's so - called ' fifth major ' might actually work to his advantage in future			0
' i 'm sure if we would have just kept playing without the break i would have done better , but at the end of the day it worked out great for me , ' @entity2 added			1
' the way i won takes a lot out of yourself , but gives you a belief that you can do it any time			0
those ( last ) three holes , it 's just about how much you want it			0
' it 's not so much about playing good golf or playing bad golf			0
it 's just about the will			0
you play with your heart and try to bring it home , and it 's how much you want to win that tournament			1
' @entity2 is among a star - studded field at @entity23 , with only @entity112 missing from the victorious @entity74 team of 2012 after opting to spend time at home with his pregnant wife			1
victory : @entity2 won the @entity16 at @entity70 nine days ago @entity119 's @entity118 , who looks certain to make his @entity74 debut in september , is also absent with a shoulder injury , but @entity123 's @entity122 - who was joint second in the masters last month - will get his first taste of the @entity128 's flagship event			1
@entity122 admits he has few memories of the tournament or the course - ' i used to watch more ice hockey than golf , ' he said - but insists he would consider adding more @entity128 events to his schedule if he was close to qualifying for @entity137			0
' if i 'm on the brink of maybe making one of the spots off the money list or the world ranking list , absolutely , ' said @entity122 , who has to play a total of 13 @entity128 events to be eligible for the team			1
' it 's tight when you play two tours			0
my schedule is pretty much set for the rest of the year			0
unless i get hurt or anything like that , i 'm planning on playing ( my 13 events )			0
' tough competition : @entity155 admits he does n't necessarily deserve to make the @entity74 team defending champion @entity155 was tipped for a @entity74 place after his victory 12 months ago , but the @entity159 admits he would not be disappointed to miss out after struggling to reproduce such form since			1
' the 12 guys that are going to make that team deserve to be on that team , ' the 21 - year - old said			1
' it 's not something that i will have thrown away			0
' the beginning is always really important			0
if you can start well then you only need one step to get in			0
now it 's almost as if i need two steps to get in			0
it 's a little bit harder so if i make it it 's going to be a great achievement and i will be extremely happy about it			0

@entity2 aiming to manage high expectations after @entity70 win
can look to @entity4 football team for *inspiration*
