as a teenager @entity0 had always been short for her age			1
for the gymnast her growth spurt came later in life , when last year , as a 15 - year - old she suddenly shot up six inches in just two months			1
but with it came a devastating blow to her dreams of competing on the world stage			1
@entity0 was diagnosed with scoliosis - an abnormal curvature of the spine			1
her mother , @entity13 , said experts revealed the condition had been caused by her daughter 's rapid growth , leaving her spine bent at 45 degrees and resembling the shape of a ' c '			1
the teenager faced the heartbreaking reality of having to give up the sport she had loved since the age of two			0
but today @entity0 is back in training , preparing for the @entity27 in @entity28 next year after experts helped straighten out her back with daily physiotherapy sessions			1
her spine was left bent at a 45 degree angle , right , resembling a c - shape , her mother @entity13 said the condition threatened @entity0 's career as a gymnast , preventing her from performing certain routines			1
but thanks to daily treatment , the 16 - year - old is now standing tall and back in training			1
she is pictured with her physical therapist @entity49 ms @entity50 , 47 , left with her daughter , said : ' she ( @entity0 ) had a big growth spurt in 2014			1
she was short for her age and developed much later because of her sport , so when she grew five or six inches in a month it caused her spine to curve off in this c - shape ' her mother , 47 , from @entity59 in @entity60 , said : ' acrobatics is @entity0 's whole life , so it was so hard when we thought she 'd have to stop - it really is everything to her so she was really upset			1
' she had a big growth spurt in 2014			1
she was short for her age and developed much later because of her sport , so when she grew five or six inches in a month it caused her spine to curve off in this ' @entity68			1
' the exercises she does now are specific to the individual and make the person really aware of their condition			0
' @entity0 now does 45 minutes of exercises per day - it 's signing up to a different way of life but it 's a small price to pay for something that improves her condition , halts progression of it and reduces pain as well			1
' @entity0 's coach first noticed something was wrong when he saw her hips and shoulders appeared uneven , with one shoulder blade protruding			2
her mother took the teenager to the @entity91 , where she was initially diagnosed as having one leg shorter than the other			0
but @entity0 began to suffer a lack of flexibility and agonising pain that prevented her from performing specific routines			2
on returning to hospital again , specialists diagnosed her with scoliosis			2
ms @entity0 said she was told her daughter faced an operation to surgically straighten her spine			1
but the procedure would have put an end to @entity0 's acrobatics for good			1
ms @entity50 said : ' when i questioned the consultant over whether @entity0 would still be able to participate in acrobatics or any other sport he replied " she will only have flexibility at the base of her spine and will be able to swim "			2
determined , @entity0 refused surgery , deciding to look at alternative therapy with her mother instead			2
@entity0 's back has now straightened out , left			2
and the gymnast , right , is preparing to take part in the @entity27 next year in @entity28 scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an s - shape			1
signs include a visible curve in the spine , one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other , clothes not handing properly and back pain			2
@entity130 usually only affects adults with the condition			0
in most cases , the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy			0
in the @entity139 , scoliosis affects three to four children could of every 1,000			0
it is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis			0
it is more common in women than in men			0
most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows			0
however , in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing			0
occasionally , a child needs surgery to straighten their spine			0
in adults , it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain			0
source : @entity167 @entity0 said : ' i was trying to train for the world championships when i found out i had scoliosis and it hurt so much			1
' there were points where i thought i would n't be able to carry on , but i still would have hated surgery because i knew the outcome to that would not have necessarily been good either			0
' ms @entity50 then discovered @entity177 - the only clinic in the world to offer treatment following the @entity181 method , which is the combination of non-surgical treatments			0
while undergoing treatment , @entity0 was taught a customised exercise programme specific to her condition over a span of four weeks			2
@entity187 , patient care co-ordinator at @entity188 , said : ' it is important to know that there are other effective treatments available for scoliosis , not just those provided by the @entity167			0
' however , due to current legislation many health professionals are unable to disclose or discuss treatment options outside of the public sector			0
' our clinic prides itself on our ability to give free , impartial advice with no obligation to visit the clinic			0
' @entity0 will now be trialing for a place to represent @entity205 at the @entity206 in @entity207 later this year			2
ms @entity50 said : ' she now has her eyes set on another @entity209 in @entity28 next year : something that seemed impossible only four weeks ago			0
