by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 18 august 2012 updated : 19:41 est , 18 august 2012 universities have been accused of discriminating against pupils who suddenly flourish in the sixth form – especially boys – by using gcses to decide which candidates to accept on to degree courses			1
the heads of some of @entity10 ’s top schools said universities were increasingly relying on the results teenagers achieve at 16 as a crude ‘ filter ’ to weed out applicants who have similar a-level grades			1
but they said bright pupils often failed to excel in gcses and only reached their full potential at @entity22			1
universities were accused of relying on the results teenagers achieve at 16 as a crude ' filter ' to weed out applicants who have similar @entity22 grades among those that require top gcse passes for courses is the @entity33 , which insists those taking its dentistry course need a minimum of six gcse a grades , while law students need a minimum of five gcse a grades			1
the heads ’ warning comes as a record number of teenagers scramble to find university places after top a-level grades fell for the first time in 20 years			1
a drop in the proportion of top grades has also been predicted when gcse results are unveiled on thursday			1
the heads said universities increasingly use gcse results as ‘ a ready reckoner ’ as competition for places reaches unprecedented levels			1
dr @entity58 , former high master of @entity59 in @entity60 – one of the most academically successful fee - paying schools – said universities were forced to use gcse results to help them select students because they had few other indicators of academic ability			1
he said : ‘ you only get in the pile for consideration if you jump that hurdle			2
they are a key gateway			2
but gcses were never designed to identify the most able and they do n’t do that			0
' as an identifier they are not fit for purpose			0
the use of an exam taken at 15 or 16 is discriminatory because of the late development of boys			0
dr @entity58 , former high master of @entity59 , said it was ' discriminatory ' ‘ even more important , really creative and clever children take risks and make mistakes , and pupils should not lose out because of that			2
’ dr @entity58 said that while gcses were good predictors of academic ability for two - thirds of pupils , for the others ‘ they are about as accurate as a clay pigeon shooter trying to hit a clay while facing the wrong way ’			2
@entity100 , headmaster of the @entity101 , said : ‘ there has been a trend for universities , particularly the leading ones , to use gcses to distinguish between candidates as competition for degree courses has risen			2
' but it discriminates against boys because gcses are a recall set of exams whereas in the a-level there is much more independent work			0
boys tend to develop later and do better at a-level where there is more independent work			0
’ the admissions authorities said gcse results were ‘ among the criteria ’ universities used , but most leading institutions now tell candidates applying for certain courses that they need to achieve top gcse passes in addition to their a-levels			1
at @entity136 , applicants for its medicine and surgery degree must have at least seven a * grades at @entity138 , and at least a grades in maths and @entity141			0
in contrast , @entity142 said : ‘ as our research shows , post- 16 exam performance is a much better predictor of degree success			0
we do not have any hard and fast gcse requirements			0
strong performance in years 12 and 13 can make up for less stellar performance at @entity138			0
’ @entity151 , the body responsible for admissions , said : ‘ gcses are among the criteria institutions consider			0
