@entity0 has less than a week to knock down his house in @entity7 , north of @entity8 mr @entity0 , 66 , has spent the past six years building it to live in with his wife @entity2 ' we 're looking into whether or not we can appeal but it appears the cost of the appeal would be prohibitive , ' mr @entity0 told @entity26			1

mr @entity0 built part of the two - storey home with wood instead of steel and the council is forcing him to knock it down because he did n't get approval mr @entity0 said the price of steel went ' through the roof ' after his first application and would have cost an extra $ 40,000 so he used timber instead , the @entity55 reported			1
in july 2011 a neighbour complained to council about inadequately secured roof sheeting on the partially built house which was flapping in the wind and making noise			2
the council 's building surveyor investigated the complaint and found a number of defects in relation to the timber framing , gang nails leaving rafters and weather damage to the timber framing and flooring			0
it was then that he also discovered the framing had been built with timber not steel			0
