@entity1 hospitals have resorted to asking zoos and vets to scan patients who are too obese to fit into hospital scanners			1
the bizarre requests to use @entity8 scanners , normally intended for four - legged animals , at the @entity11 ’s leading veterinary college in north @entity12 were revealed as hospitals face pressure to adapt beds and wards for an increasingly obese population			1
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) yesterday said its ct scanners , customised for horses , could be used to accommodate patients weighing 30 stone or more but they would need to get a special licence to scan humans			1
@entity8 scanners usually used by zoos and vet for horses could help scan obese human patients @entity28 , a geriatric registrar at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity12 , said he was told to refer obese patients to @entity32 when he was training			1
the practice of referring patients to zoos is commonplace in @entity36 where obesity has reached epidemic levels			2
writing on his blog , he said ‘ imagine the humiliation for the patient			0
‘ i ’m sorry sir but you are too fat to have a ct scan , so we are going to have to send you to the zoo where they are used to dealing with larger specimens			1
’ ' however a spokesperson from the @entity49 , which oversees @entity29 , said : ' we have never referred or been asked to refer a patient to @entity32 or the @entity17 for scanning			0
' @entity32 also denied taking obese patients but a spokeswoman for the @entity17 confirmed they have been approached			1
she said ‘ we have been approached on several occasions but have always said we are only licensed to perform scans on animals			0
’ it is not known whether any veterinary colleges are seeking licenses to perform the procedure			0
hospitals face pressure to adapt equipment for @entity11 's obese population dr @entity28 added ‘ some bright spark decided it would be a good idea to up the loading capacity of the tables we use in the @entity8 scanners , so the problem of having patients too big to scan is not one we face all that often			1
‘ wheelchairs are wider , theatre operating tables are stronger and we have access to reinforced hospital beds when we need them			0
being overweight has become the norm			0
’ the ct scanner at the @entity17 is housed in the equine hospital and is used with a specially built table to support anaesthetised horses			1
ct scans are used by doctors to assess body fat as well as for more general health checks to see if anything is wrong			0
@entity87 ’s fire crews have spent millions on callouts by the @entity1 in recent years shifting obese patients who have got stuck in the bath or their bedrooms , or who can not be safely lifted by ambulance staff			2
a report last year warned the @entity1 is ‘ poorly prepared ’ to deal with obese patients , lacking staff and equipment to care for them safely			2
bigger trolley , beds and wheelchairs are needed – with more than half of women and almost two thirds of men likely to be obese by 2050 , according to official estimates			0
the report found incidents involved equipment not being able to take the weight of obese patients , with specially adapted equipment either not being available or normal equipment not working properly when used with obese patients .			2

@entity112 sized ct scanners too *small* for obese
ct scanners customised for horses could accommodate growing problem
