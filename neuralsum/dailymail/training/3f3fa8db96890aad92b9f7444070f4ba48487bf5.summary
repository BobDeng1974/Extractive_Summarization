by @entity0 published : 03:52 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 06:03 est , 13 august 2012 a boy 's devout @entity2 parents have lost their battle to keep him alive after a judge ruled doctors could withdraw life - support treatment despite their plea to leave the decision ' in @entity11 's hands '			1
mr @entity12 said it would be wrong to keep the eight - year - old alive and possibly in pain when there was no hope he would recover from lung failure			1
he did acknowledge the boy 's parents and teenage sister 's beliefs during the ruling on friday , after they told the @entity23 they were praying for a miracle and were convinced the youngster was still conscious			2
ruling : the @entity23 in @entity26 heard that there was no hope the eight - year - old boy would recover from lung failure weighing up the benefits and burdens of keeping the boy alive , mr @entity12 said that ' with a heavy heart ' he would rule in favour of the hospital 's request to stop life - support treatment			1
the court heard how the boy , who can not be named , had been born prematurely and had undergone surgery for several holes in the heart when he was just three months old			0
he went on to live a normal life until june this year when his health deteriorated following surgery to remove a band around his pulmonary artery			0
he was put onto a life - support machine which took over both his heart and lung function			0
a month later , doctors saw no improvement in the boy , the court heard			0
his lungs remained blocked and he was heavily sedated			0
doctors also said because he was on a duel - function ' @entity58 ' life - support system , the boy was more likely to develop infections and suffer pain and a painful death			0
justice @entity12 said : ' it is now the view of the hospital team that there is no prospect of his heart or lungs recovering and therefore no hope of survival ' the boy 's mother , who asked for a sign saying ' be strong and courageous , do not be frightened because the @entity74 your @entity11 goes with you ' to be put above his bed , said although she accepted the medical evidence the family had not lost hope			1
pain : doctors said because the boy was on a duel - function ' @entity58 ' life - support system , he was more likely to develop infections and suffer pain ( file picture ) she said : ' unexpected things can happen and because of ( the boy ’s ) faith and my trust in @entity11 and my understanding that he is the one who gave him life he is the one alone who can end that life , i can not agree to the lifeline of oxygen being taken away from him			2
@entity11 could intervene in a miraculous way			0
' she added the family were not afraid of the boy dying but did not believe it was down to them or medical staff to decide when his life should end and how it would be a ' betrayal of trust ' if they did			1
the mother said the case had caused the family ' emotional trauma ' adding : ' i would plead that we might be allowed to have days without this threat hanging over us that we may be able to spend more time with him			0
' meanwhile , the boy ’s 17 - year - old sister said her brother had told her that it was his faith that had kept him going until now			1
she added the hospital 's decision to switch off her brother 's life support had been ' very quick '			2
clinicians made their decision to withdraw treatment last week , which prompted the boy 's parents to take the hospital 's application to court			2
summing up , mr @entity12 said : ' i hope that he continues to live his life with dignity and when his life ends his family will understand that he lived it to the full			1

mr @entity12 said it would be wrong to keep eight - year - old alive and possibly in pain
boy 's mother said family believed he was conscious of their *presence*
she added *shortening* boy 's life was not decision for family or medical staff but @entity11
