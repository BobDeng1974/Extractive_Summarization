@entity0 , 27 , was left speechless when she spotted ' @entity1 ' written in the grass during a 45 - minute glider flight at her local airfield			1
@entity5 gave his girlfriend the flying lesson as a birthday treat but had secretly planned to surprise her by popping the question			1
the 46 - year - old had spent several weeks secretly designing and making the letters in his living room using 80 metres of wallpaper and string			1
the proposal was captured on film after @entity5 's friends at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , helped him plan his surprise last sunday			1
yesterday , @entity0 , a physiotherapist , said : ' on my birthday , @entity5 took me out in the car and we drove past the gliding club			1
' when he turned in i thought that was a great idea for a present as i love action things like that			0
' i 'd done a sky dive but never had a chance to get in a glider despite the fact i live so close to the centre			0
' i went up for what was meant to be a half hour trip and i think i noticed that it seemed to be going on longer , but i just thought that was something to do with it being my birthday			0
' rob the pilot kept radioing in and they said the runway was busy and i just thought nothing of it			0
' i thought that he may propose when we went away in a few weeks , but i never expected this			2
' when @entity58 got the call that the runway was clear he flew back but then banked the plane around and i could see something on the ground			0
@entity5 popped the question by spelling out the words , ' @entity64 ' using giant white letters ( right ) on the grass of their local flying centre as she flew overhead in a glider ' when i saw the words ' will you marry me ' , i could n't believe it			1
i was so shocked i burst into tears and think i swore a lot			1
' i could n't believe he had done something like that , i was in complete and utter shock and i was actually quite emotional			0
' when we landed again @entity5 was waiting and he gave me this beautiful ring			1
@entity0 has revealed she burst into tears after spotting the proposal while flying above the flying centre during a gliding lesson ' of course i said yes			1
it was a wonderful day and something i will never forget			0
' the couple , who have been together for two years after meeting on an online dating website , plan to get married next year			1
computer programmer @entity5 revealed his plan almost turned to disaster when had to pin the letters down with knives and forks after running out of tent pegs			2
@entity5 , from @entity99 , said : ' i really do n't know where i came up with the idea , i guessed that she would think on her birthday was a really obvious place time to do it			1
' i knew she liked the idea of gliding so i booked the lesson and spoke to the club about my plans			0
@entity5 was pleased when he saw @entity0 's on the in - flight video recording after admitting she wasn ; t an easy woman to surprise ' they were really helpful , it was even there idea to put the cameras on			1
' i then had to make the letters in my living room one at a time			0
' on the day @entity0 went up and the club lent me a guy to help , and we set about putting the letters up			2
' but when we were about two thirds done i ran out of tent pegs so we had to find something else to use			0
' eventually we got to the canteen and found knives and forks we could use			0
' i had been carrying the letters around in my car all day , @entity0 had been in the boot several times and i had to try and hide all this amount of wallpaper and string			2
@entity5 and @entity134 at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , where he proposed last sunday , during a gliding lesson for @entity134 ( top ) ' but eventually we got it done and when she came down i got on one knee and she said yes			2
' she is n't normally someone to show her emotions in a big way so the reaction on the video was amazing			0
' i managed to surprise her which is n't easy with her so i felt really good			0
