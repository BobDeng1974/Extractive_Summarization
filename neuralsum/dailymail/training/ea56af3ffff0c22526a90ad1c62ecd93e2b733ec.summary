@entity1 attorney general @entity0 took to @entity3 's ' @entity2 ' sunday morning to blast conservative personality and former vice presidential candidate @entity5 , in response to her editorial calling for the impeachment of president @entity9			1
' she was n't a particularly good vice presidential candidate ' said @entity0 on the political talk show , speaking to host @entity13			0
' she 's an even worse judge of who ought to be impeached and why			0
' @entity0 's comments were responses to an editorial written by @entity5 and published last week on @entity18 , entitled ' @entity19 to impeach president @entity9			1
' @entity1 attorney general @entity0 ( pictured left ) took aim at a recent op - ed by @entity5 ( pictured right ) , in which the conservative personality advocated for the impeachment of president @entity9 @entity5 's article asserts that @entity9 is purposefully weakening the border security between the @entity1 and @entity28 , and declares it grounds for impeachment proceedings to begin			1
' enough is enough of the years of abuse from this president , ' she opened her op - ed with			1
' his unsecured border crisis is the last straw that makes the battered wife say , " no mas			0
” ' @entity0 responded with disdain for @entity5 's criticisms , also denouncing ' gridlocked @entity41 ' and the @entity43 's continuing efforts to block any initiatives from the @entity45			1
' for whatever reason , [ some ] @entity43 decided early on that this was a president they were just simply not going to cooperate with , ' @entity0 told @entity49 ' @entity48 in a rare interview			0
' and over the past five - and - a - half years , we have seen demonstrations of that , where the president has reached out his hand , offered compromises that have simply not been met [ in the way ] they have been in the past by a @entity43 willing to do the appropriate things			0
' @entity0 on @entity3 's ' @entity2 , ' where he also criticized the @entity43 lawsuit against @entity61 and defended himself against accusations that he should be impeached for declining to appoint a special prosecutor to handle investigation of the @entity66 scandal @entity0 also dismissed calls for himself to be impeached due to declining to appoint a special prosecutor to deal with the latest @entity66 scandal involving former executive @entity70 and allegations of targeting of conservative politicians and covering it up			1
@entity0 insisted that hiring a special prosecutor was not necessary , and @entity76 agents investigating the allegations were ' doing a good , professional job			2
' in @entity81 op - ed , she claimed that a lax approach by @entity9 in the enforcement of border security is allowing illegal immigrants to flood the country and irreparably damage the middle class by adding an undue burden on various @entity1 resources			1
@entity5 also warned that without action now , @entity9 's ' lawlessness ' would worsen			2
' it ’s not going to get better , and in fact irreparable harm can be done in this lame - duck term as he continues to make up his own laws as he goes along , and , mark my words , will next meddle in the @entity100 with appointments that will forever change the basic interpretation of our @entity104 ’s role in protecting our rights			0
' she concluded her op - ed with ' the many impeachable offenses of @entity9 can no longer be ignored			1
if after all this he ’s not impeachable , then no one is			0
' in the @entity3 interview , @entity0 commented that he believed that some level of racism was involved with the cries of @entity43 to impeach both himself and @entity9			2
@entity0 contended that the criticisms of himself and @entity9 ( pictured ) have some basis in ' racial animus ' ' there 's a certain level of vehemence , it seems to me , that 's directed at me [ and ] directed at the president , ' @entity0 said			2
' you know , people talking about taking their country back			1
… there 's a certain racial component to this for some people			2
i do n’t think this is the thing that is a main driver , but for some there 's a racial animus			0
' house speaker @entity136 ( @entity137 ) and other @entity43 leaders have said that they do not support calls for @entity9 's impeachment			1
@entity136 does support a lawsuit filed against the @entity61 , which @entity0 also lambasted in his interview			0
' it 's a more , i think , a political gesture than a truly legal one , ' @entity0 said			0
' filing a lawsuit against the president that has no basis is not going to improve the quality of life for the @entity1 people			0

@entity0 was responding to a july 8 op - ed by @entity5 published on @entity18 , in which she claimed that @entity9 's lax *policies* regarding border control were grounds for impeachment
also criticized by @entity0 were calls for his own impeachment due to his declining to hire a special prosecutor to handle the @entity66 scandal , as well as the @entity43 - led lawsuit against @entity61
@entity0 : ' a certain racial component ' to ' people talking about taking their country back '
