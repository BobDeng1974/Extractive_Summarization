as the harsh winter looks set to cause disruption and delay to airports throughout the country , @entity1 staff relieved their boredom - by drawing a lewd picture in the snow			1
the picture was snapped by a passenger at @entity11 , and has since gone viral on social networks , showing just how the no - frills airline likes to get its thrills			1
despite the freezing temperatures and evident dismay of staff and customers , the members of staff still showed off their artistic skill right outside the terminal window , even appearing to look up at spectators			0
@entity1 staff took advantage of the poor weather by drawing a giant penis into the snow at @entity11 a spokesman for @entity1 told @entity29 : ' while our ground crew excel at industry leading 25 minute turnarounds , art is n’t their forte , as they ’ve clearly forgotten to draw wings on their snow airplane			1
' it 's something you might expect as a high - school prank , however , the design has been well received on @entity42			0
one user , @entity43 , even went as far as to say the design was ' better than @entity45 '			0
the @entity47 humour was heralded by @entity48 as he wrote : ' oh , @entity47			1
do n't ever change ! ' however , some users used the circulating photograph to aim a dig at the company 's boss @entity52			2
@entity54 wrote that in their opinion the drawing shows what the ' @entity1 staff think of their boss ' , while this sentiment was also echoed by @entity60			1
@entity1 has launched a charm offensive in recent months as it seeks to improve its customer relations			2
fees for extra baggage and boarding cards at the airports have been cut significantly , and passengers are now allowed to carry a ' smaller ' second bag on board			0
and in june last year the company announced new family product , @entity72 , offering families a range of discounts on travel and an improved service on @entity1 flights			0
the charm offensive is clearly paying off , with the controversial budget airline posting £ 37million profits for the last quarter , well above analyst expectations .			0
