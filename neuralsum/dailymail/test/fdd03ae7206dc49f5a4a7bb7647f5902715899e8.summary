@entity0 edged closer towards an exit from @entity2 on wednesday night after admitting in a tv interview that he is not ready to sign a new contract at @entity5			1
@entity0 has been offered a £ 100,000 - a - week deal to stay on @entity7 and revealed in a @entity9 interview on wednesday that he would have signed for a lot less a year ago			1
but in an in - depth tv discussion that @entity2 knew nothing about until shortly before it was aired the 20 - year - old admitted that it was ' quite flattering ' to be linked to @entity14 – who @entity2 face on saturday in the @entity16 – and that he used to dream of playing abroad			1
@entity0 has turned down a new deal with @entity2 and put off contract talks until the summer @entity0 , pictured celebrating a goal for @entity21 , says he does not want to be seen as a money - grabber @entity0 's current £ 35,000 - a - week deal at @entity2 has two years to run at the end of this season @entity0 has attracted interest from clubs including @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity14 @entity0 arrives for training at @entity2 's @entity32 training ground @entity0 arrives at training ahead of @entity2 's game with @entity14 @entity16 appearances : 28 goals : 6 assists : 7 @entity37 / @entity38 appearances : 8 goals : 0 assists : 1 @entity2 are infuriated by @entity0 's decision to give the interview without even telling them and some members of the club 's hierarchy are convinced that the @entity21 international and his representatives are simply preparing the way for a move this summer			1
' it 's not about the money at all , ' @entity0 said			2
' it 's never been about money			0
i talk about winning trophies throughout my career			0
that 's all i talk about			0
' i do n't talk about how many cars i 'm going to drive , how many houses i 've got			0
i just purely want to be the best i can be			0
' i do n't want to be perceived as a money - grabbing 20 - year - old			0
' i try to kill it off , but i do n't think the public can see it that way			0
' i think they just see it as this 20 - year - old boy being greedy			0
' i just want to take the time to think about what i 've achieved in my career so far , where i need to go and what i need to do to get better as a player			0
@entity0 says that he would have signed a less lucrative deal if he had been offered one at this stage last year @entity0 has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £ 100,000 - a - week to stay at @entity2 @entity0 takes on @entity79 's @entity78 during @entity21 's @entity81 qualifier at @entity82 ' everyone 's dream growing up is seeing themselves in an away kit somewhere in a sunny country			1
but , in reality , i 'm happy to be playing for @entity2 and trying to win trophies			2
' ' if , at that point in time [ last season ] , i was offered a contract , i most definitely would have signed straight away , probably for far less money than being said now			1
' i just think the timing was a bit off			0
' @entity0 's stand - off with @entity2 has been a theme of the club 's season so far			1
@entity2 fans will be desperate for him to stay but it would now appear that the gap between himself and his club is widening			0
manager @entity103 is aware of @entity0 's comments and will address them as part of his weekly press conference on friday			1
it is understood that he will not allow the issue to cloud his judgement ahead of his selection for saturday 's game and that @entity0 – if fit – will play at the @entity113			2
equally , however , @entity2 's @entity115 owners will not allow themselves to be bullied over this issue and are prepared to stand firm – just as they did with @entity117 in 2013 – unless they receive an astronomical offer for a player they value in excess of £ 50m			2
there will be no shortage of suitors for @entity0 should he leave @entity2 - in the @entity16 and @entity124 @entity0 insists that he is focused on winning trophies and becoming the best player he can be @entity2 boss @entity103 must convince @entity0 to sign a new deal and remain at @entity5 @entity2 are not prepared to sell to a @entity16 rival – @entity29 are also interested – unless the numbers involved are astronomical			1
patience with @entity0 and his representatives is shortening , however			2
@entity103 feels that it is @entity0 's management team are driving the whole issue but is also known to feel that players should take control of their own destiny , however young they are .			1
