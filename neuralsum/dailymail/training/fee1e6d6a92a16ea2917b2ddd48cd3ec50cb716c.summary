by @entity0 @entity2 's comments on players asking to be excused from international duty were ' mischievous ' and an unwanted ' grenade ' , according to @entity7 chief executive @entity6			1
@entity9 's claim that @entity11 players asked him to pull them out of national games while he was @entity13 manager have added to the blame games being played in the wake of the @entity18 ' @entity17 exit			1
captain @entity19 has told @entity2 to name the culprits , but the 67 - year - old has @entity22 , the issue is one @entity18 do not need as the pieces of their loss to @entity26 are picked up and he feels @entity2 's comments could have been avoided			1
@entity28 : @entity2 has claimed @entity13 players asked to be pulled out of international duty ' i know @entity2 , i admire @entity2 , and i do n't know in what context he 's said it , i 'm perfectly happy to talk to him about it , he 's a football man and it may have come from one particular player for some special reason , ' he told @entity38			1
' it 's a little bit mischievous to throw out grenades like that at the end of a @entity17 disappointment			0
i think we all have to get focused and move on			0
' @entity6 insists he does not know of any players to have asked not to be picked for duty and believes omissions are often the fault of club managers			1
' i do n't know of any youngsters who have done that			0
i do know at times there is pressure from managers for players not to go because they 've got big games , " he added			2
' they were saying that players were injured - this came from the manager not the player - and this is one of the reasons they ( players ) have to turn up for @entity18 and be examined by the doctor because i can tell you , far from it being the players , there have been more players pulled out of @entity18 by managers rather than by the players themselves			2
' no ! @entity74 chief @entity6 says that club managers can put pressure on players to miss international games grenade : @entity6 insists @entity2 's comments are not helpful during disappointment of @entity18 's exit and @entity6 reckons playing for their country still matters to players			1
' i do n't think it helps to stir up such things at this time now when everybody is disappointed that we are no longer at the @entity17 party , ' he said			0
' i think that we should be focusing on getting a team out there and salvaging some pride against @entity95			0
but it 's what makes the world go round			0
i do feel it 's unfortunate but i think most people in the game or any player in the game would say any chance to play for @entity18 , they 'd carry their bags around the world			2
' it 's a manager knowing his players and i would say with @entity110 , in fact virtually every manager i know , they know who 'll go through brick walls for them and who wo n't			0
