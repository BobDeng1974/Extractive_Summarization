thanks to missions like @entity4 's @entity3 , we know @entity5 once had water - but until now we did n't know how much			2
scientists have provided the best estimates yet , claiming it once had more water than the @entity11 - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years			1
the findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on @entity5 to thrive , but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry			1
@entity4 scientists in @entity22 have calculated how much water was once on @entity5			1
they found that 3.7 billion years ago it had more than the @entity11			1
most of this would have been in the northern hemisphere of the planet ( illustrated )			2
since then , 87 % of the water has been lost to space , with the rest stored in ice at the poles the study by scientists at @entity4 ’s @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity22 , is the first to determine just how much water @entity5 had in its past			1
during its wet @entity41 period - 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago - it is estimated that it had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet ( 137 metres ) deep			1
however , it ’s likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of @entity5 , which would have been as deep as one mile ( 1.6km ) in places - comparable to the @entity52 on @entity53			1
published in the journal @entity56 , the research estimates that , in total , what is now the planet ’s arid northern plains would have contained at least 12.4 million cubic miles ( 20 million cubic kilometres ) of water			0
@entity69 ’s ‘ @entity65 ' headset , which allows wearers to see 3d images superimposed over their vision , may look like it belongs in a sci - fi film			0
and now @entity4 has revealed the prototype technology will be used to enable its scientists to work virtually on @entity5			0
the headset will work with @entity75 software to give scientists a means to plan experiments on the red planet , with the help of the @entity3			0
the software was developed jointly by the two companies , including a team at @entity4 ’s @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85			0
‘ our study provides a solid estimate of how much water @entity5 once had , by determining how much water was lost to space , ’ said dr @entity86 , first author of the paper and a scientist at @entity4 ’s @entity36			1
‘ with this work , we can better understand the history of water on @entity5			0
’ it is thought that while 87 per cent of the water has since been lost to space , owing largely to the planet losing its atmosphere , the remaining 13 per cent resides in the ice caps			2
but in the past , the ocean would have covered about 20 per cent of the planet ’s surface area			0
the most interesting conclusion , though , is that @entity5 stayed wet for longer than previously thought , which means it was habitable for longer			2
‘ we now know that @entity5 was wet for a much longer time than we thought before , ’ said dr @entity110 , co-author of the study and senior scientist at @entity36			1
‘ @entity3 shows it was wet for 1.5 billion years , already much longer than the period of time needed for life to develop on @entity53			1
‘ and now we see that @entity5 must have been wet for a period even longer			2
’ during its wet @entity41 period , 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago , it is estimated that @entity5 had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet ( 137 metres ) deep			1
however , it ’s likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of @entity5 ( illustrated ) as deep as one mile in places it is thought that while 87 % of the water has since been lost to space ( illustrated ) , owing largely to the planet losing its atmosphere , the remaining 13 % resides in the ice caps			1
but in the past , the ocean would have covered about 20 per cent of the planet ’s surface area the research was carried out using two telescopes at the @entity139 on @entity140 and the @entity142 ’s @entity141 in @entity143			0
to make the discovery , the scientists produced maps showing the distribution of normal water in the @entity5 atmosphere and ' heavy ' water containing deuterium , a more massive form of hydrogen			0
by analysing the ratio of ' heavy ' to regular water they showed that @entity5 must have lost a volume of water 6.5 times larger than the amount trapped in the present day polar ice caps			2
an ancient ocean containing the lost water would have covered 19 per cent of the planet ’s surface			0
it would have had a greater volume than the @entity11 , which contains 18,750,000 cubic kilometres ( 11.7 million cubic miles ) of water			0
by comparison , the @entity168 covers 17 per cent of the surface of the @entity53 and contains more than 310 million cubic kilometres ( 192.6 million cubic miles )			0
it is possible that @entity5 once had even more water , some of which may have been deposited below the surface			0
because the new maps reveal microclimates and changes in the atmospheric water content over time , they may also prove to be useful in the search for underground water			0
an ancient ocean on @entity5 containing the lost water would have covered 19 per cent of the planet ’s surface			2
it would have had a greater volume than the @entity11 ( shown ) , which contains 18,750,000 cubic kilometres ( 11.7 million cubic miles ) of water missions like the @entity3 ( illustrated ) have shown that @entity5 was once wet for 1.5 billion years , but the scientists now think it had water for even longer			1
this is longer than the time it took life on @entity53 to arise , providing tantalising hints that @entity5 might once have been habitable			1

@entity36 scientists in @entity22 studied past water on @entity5
they found that 3.7 billion years ago it had more than the @entity11
most of this would have been in the northern hemisphere of the planet
since then , 87 % has been lost to space and the rest is in ice at the poles
but the scientists now know @entity5 was wet for more than 1.5 billion years
this is ' longer than the period of time needed for life to develop on @entity53 '
