a thousand transgender @entity0 have marched in their country 's first ever @entity2 parade to mark a year since their official recognition as a third gender			1
@entity7 's busy streets were brought to a standstill as the transgender women , known as hijras in @entity0 , drew crowds with their dancing and singing			1
the group , many wearing colourful saris , unfurled a huge @entity0 flag and carried banners , one of which read : ' the days of stigma , discrimination and fear are over '			1
' we are stigmatised everywhere			0
we are laughed at just because we do not feel like a man or woman			0
we feel like we 're normal human beings , ' @entity69 added			0
hijras have been a part of life in south @entity46 going back to antiquity			1
they are mentioned in the @entity49 and live in communities across @entity0 , @entity51 and @entity52			2
their communities have sustained themselves over generations by ' adopting ' young boys who have run away from or been rejected by their families			0
hijras have long suffered discrimination , particularly during the era of the @entity89 when authorities labelled them ' a breach of public decency ' and tried to eradicate them			1
but last november , in a landmark decision , the government of @entity0 prime minister @entity95 passed laws to recognise hijras as a third gender , allowing them to identify themselves as a separate gender in passports and other state papers			2
