scientists have finally answered the question : is there anybody there ? a spooky experiment which conjured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it ’s only our mind playing tricks			1
the invisible , creepy presence reported by so many people over the centuries is just a set of mixed - up signals in the brain			1
by having signals mixed up in their brains ( shown ) , volunteers were made to feel that a creepy ' presence ' was behind them			1
they counted up to four phantoms positioned where no - one was standing the sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers			1
two volunteers were so unnerved by the feeling of being surrounded by ghosts , they asked for the experiment to stop			1
they counted up to four phantoms positioned where no - one was standing - and touching their backs with invisible fingers			0
the illusion came from a programmed delay between the brain ’s processing of the body ’s movements and the body ’s position in space			1
whether we are alone in the universe is one of life ’s unanswered questions			2
but a new poll suggests that the majority of us are convinced aliens exist , and that we 're more likely to believe in little green men than @entity63			0
according to the research , children in particular are so confident in the existence of extraterrestrial beings that they think family members are aliens in disguise			2
the poll of 2,000 adults and children was carried out by @entity72 attraction in @entity74			2
each of the participants were asked to rate how strongly they believed in five supernatural or religious beings including aliens , ghosts , ufos , angels and @entity63			2
ghosts topped the adult ’s list on 55 per cent , followed by aliens on 51 per cent and ufos on 42 per cent			1
@entity63 was at the bottom of their list of beliefs on 25 per cent , behind angels on 27 per cent			0
children believed in aliens and ghosts equally ( 64 per cent ) , ufos scored 50 per cent followed by @entity63 on 33 per cent			2
@entity96 were bottom of this group 's list on 27 per cent			0
the interference in the brain was sufficient to make the volunteers believe the signals were no longer from their own bodies - but from someone else			1
the findings appear to explain the common experience people have of feeling an unseen presence , even a guardian angel , demon or apparition stalking their movements			1
these are frequently reported by people in extreme physical or emotional situations , such as mountaineers and explorers , or those grieving for a lost loved one			2
they are also associated with medical conditions that affect the brain , including epilepsy , migraine , schizophrenia and cancer			2
professor @entity125 , who led a team at the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) in @entity128 , says the research has given up the ghost to science			1
he said : ‘ our experiment induced the sensation of a foreign presence in the laboratory for the first time			1
it shows that it can arise under normal conditions , simply through conflicting sensory - motor signals			2
‘ the robotic system mimics the sensations of some patients with mental disorders or of healthy individuals under extreme circumstances			0
‘ this confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain			1
’ here an unamed participant takes part in the experiment			0
the robot made humans feel the illusory presence of a non-existent ' ghost '			1
the study was conducted on 12 individuals with various neurological conditions such as epilepsy , stroke , migraine and tumours the scientists re-created the ‘ feelings of presence ’ - known as @entity174 - using a slave robot device that allowed volunteers to control the movements of a jointed mechanical arm with their index fingers			1
the movements were translated to another robot arm behind them which touched their backs			2
when both the finger - pushing and back - touching occurred at the same time , it created the illusion that the volunteers were caressing their own backs			2
that felt weird enough to the blindfolded participants			0
but something a lot stranger happened when the back - touching was delayed and about 500 milliseconds out of sync with the finger movements			0
one in three of the volunteers felt as if they were being watched , and touched , by one or more ghostly presences			0
at the same time , they had the disconcerting sensation of drifting backwards , towards the unseen hand			0
when questioned , several reported a strong feeling of invisible people being close to them			0
on average , they counted two , with up to four being reported			0
two of the 12 healthy participants were so disturbed by the experience that they asked the scientists to halt the experiment , the results of which appear in the journal @entity209			0
the scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain			1
‘ this confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain , ' said professor @entity125 of the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) in @entity128 co-author dr @entity222 , also from the @entity127 , said : ‘ our brain possesses several representations of our body in space			1
under normal conditions , it is able to assemble a unified self - perception of the self from these representations			0
‘ but when the system malfunctions because of disease - or , in this case , a robot - this can sometimes create a second representation of one ’s own body , which is no longer perceived as ‘ me ’ but as someone else , a “ presence ”			1
’ the researchers describe in the journal the case of mountaineer , @entity247 , who had an @entity174 experience while descending from the summit of the @entity252 peak @entity253 in june , 1970			0
accompanied by his brother , he was freezing , exhausted and oxygen - starved			0
he recalled becoming aware of a third climber ' descending with us , keeping a regular distance , a little to my right and a few steps away from me , just outside my field of vision '			0
before conducting the experiment , the researchers carried out brain scans of 12 patients with neurological disorders who had encountered @entity174 in the past			1
they identified disturbances in three specific brain regions , the insular cortex , parietal - frontal cortex , and temporo - parietal cortex			0
all were involved in self - awareness , movement , and sense of position in space .			0

@entity128 researchers carried out an experiment to make artificial ' ghosts '
they were *investigating* why some people feel a ' creepy presence '
and in the research they found it was just a trick of the brain
the sensation was re-created by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers
the illusion came from a programmed delay between the brain ’s processing of the body ’s movements
‘ this confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain , ' said professor @entity125
