a @entity1 explorer is celebrating leading a team of cavers to the lowest depth ever recorded in the @entity5			1
@entity6 , 31 , spent seven weeks with his group navigating the @entity9 cave system in @entity10 , one of the most remote places ever reached inside the earth			1
located in @entity16 mountains , the cave system has 17 entrances and endless different routes into the centre			2
@entity1 explorer @entity6 spent seven weeks navigating the huge @entity9 cave system in @entity10 explorers were dwarfed in the vast @entity23 , the largest chamber in the caves @entity26 , from @entity27 , pictured carrying diving gear through a sump reached the deepest into the earth that anyone has been in the @entity5 the group of cave explorers scaled raging rivers as they reached the bottom of the caves @entity6 's group , made up of 40 people from around the world , managed to dive , swim , climb and descend through a labyrinth of pitch black tunnels			1
they had the gruelling task of navigating eerie , water - filled abysses known as sumps			2
at one stage swam underwater in darkness for 600 metres in a 28 metre deep river			0
during these dives , the group had no knowledge of where they were heading			0
team member @entity26 , from @entity27 , reached the depth of 1,545 metres , the deepest anyone has been in the @entity5 - and the eighth deepest in history			1
the group beat the previous record of 1,484 metres set nearby in the @entity61 caves while the previous record in @entity9 was 1,475 metres			1
the experience is a far cry from @entity6 's day job , where he works an office - based software consultant in @entity67			2
for the expedition , @entity6 managed to negotiate nine weeks ' unpaid leave			2
he said : ' you do n't know what is happening in front of you but we traced the water 's route to a canyon seven miles away			0
' we knew where it is heading but we did n't know what was between			0
it is genuine exploration and it is really exciting			0
the team spent up to ten nights underground at a time , sleeping in the cave and scuba diving flooded tunnels			1
@entity26 after his dive in sump 9 , which made him a record breaker the team of 40 people had to navigate pitch black tunnels , water - filled abysses , with no idea where they were heading a 110 - metre pitch one of many obstacles on the way to the bottom of the caves in southern @entity10 in the @entity9 cave system , the cavers went without seeing any natural light for 10 days at a time he described his once in a life time experience : ' you do n't feel the depth underground , but you are aware of the remoteness and that you 're two days away from sunlight			1
' it is quite tranquil and eerie in places , but it is also very noisy in others because of the fast - flowing river			0
' the largest underwater sump was 600 metres long and 28 metres deep while the last sump reached was 440 metres long and 81 metres deep			0
team members came from the @entity1 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity10 , working tirelessly to haul ropes , camping equipment and scuba gear up and down			1
they set the record around three weeks into the exploration , before spending the next four weeks removing all their gear			0
first , the cave drivers had to swim 600 metres underwater through two flooded tunnels to reach their advance camp			0
they then spent one week exploring ' sump 9 ' and looking for a way to bypass the flooded tunnel which represents the current end of the system			2
it was sump 9 where @entity26 reached the record depth , with the explorers going without natural light for more than ten days			1
840 metres below the surface the team prepare their dive equipment , which weighed 500 kg the group of 40 people from around the world navigated tunnels , abysses and sheer rock faces on their epic journey the group managed to beat the previous record of 1,484 metres set nearby in the @entity61 caves in total , they took 500kg of equipment for the trip , when they set off on february 28			1
@entity6 added : ' it was incredibly deep and incredibly remote			0
it was a challenge and adventure and it was physically very demanding			0
' at the time the depth was n't the most important thing , we were just pleased we ran a safe and smooth operation '			2

@entity10 's @entity9 is the deepest cave in the western *hemisphere*
explorers reached record - breakingly low depth on seven - week expedition
team spent up to ten nights underground at a time , sleeping in the caves
