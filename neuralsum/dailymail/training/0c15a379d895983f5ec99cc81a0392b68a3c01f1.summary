by @entity0 published : 05:49 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 07:41 est , 3 december 2012 hospitals are so ' full to bursting ' that staff are struggling to keep patients safe , an influential report has warned			2
and death rates at 12 @entity7 hospitals are ' worryingly high '			1
the dr @entity8 report - produced annually by the @entity7 watchdog , and part funded by the @entity13 - also warns ' quality should not be sacrificed for cost ' or patients could be in danger			1
unless there is change there could be a repeat of the @entity22 hospital scandal - where up to 1,200 patients died because of poor care , it said			2
the report , which excluded specialist centres but included 145 hospital trusts , said when hospitals were too busy patient care suffered because systems started ' breaking down ' the @entity8 guide shows how admissions were broken down by patient group across the country the main findings of the report published today , were : the guide said when hospitals were too busy patient care suffered because systems started ' breaking down ' it said : ' hospitals are under pressure from the rising numbers of emergency admissions , particularly among frail elderly patients			1
' for 48 weeks a year most trusts are more than 90 per cent occupied			1
high levels of occupancy make it harder to provide a safe , effective service			0
' each of the 12 trusts which had high death rates fell short on two of four mortality rate indicators - ' deaths after surgery ' and the deaths of patients who were admitted for minor ailments or ' low - risk conditions '			1
' these measures are to be used as a warning sign that poor - quality care may be leading to a higher - than - expected mortality			1
' with the rising demand for care and falling revenues , there are concerns that trusts will focus more ( or exclusively ) on cost of care rather than quality of care			2
' because of this , there is a fear that there could be another @entity79			0
hospital managers must ensure that they do not sacrifice one for the other			0
' the @entity82 is at the centre of an £ 11million inquiry			0
as many as 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at the trust between 2005 and 2009 due to poor care and medical errors			0
@entity89 @entity90 @entity91 @entity92 @entity94 and @entity93 @entity95 @entity96 @entity97 @entity98 @entity99 @entity100 @entity101 the report comes as the government drives forward an ' efficiency ' plan which will see £ 20bn slashed from the @entity7 budget			0
@entity107 , chief executive of @entity108 , said : ' these distressing figures reveal bed occupancy rates are at the very limit of what is safe or indeed desirable for patients			1
' our helpline hears day in day out from patients and relatives who are experiencing unacceptably poor care , with nursing staff telling relatives that they simply not having time to deliver the fundamentals of good care or dignity			0
' the government must consider the devastating impact its £ 20 billion efficiency drive is having on the number of hospital beds , at a time when we have an aging population and rising admissions			2
' moving forward care , particularly for the elderly , must be better integrated so that when appropriate it can take place in home and community settings			0
' but @entity99 ( @entity137 ) - one of the 12 trusts named as having higher death rates in the two categories - raised concerns about the validity of the @entity8 indicators			1
the @entity8 reports rank mortality - or deaths - with a measurement called the @entity147 ( @entity148 )			1
it measures if the death rate at a hospital is higher or lower than expected using a series of indicators			0
dr @entity153 , medical director at the trust , said : ' the @entity148 ( @entity147 ) is widely considered to be unsuitable for use as a comparative indicator between hospitals			0
' dr @entity8 frequently changes the methodology of the @entity148 which , in our opinion , further reduces its credibility as a comparator			2
' he said : ' in our opinion , the mortality indicator relating to conditions of low clinical risk is deeply flawed			2
' to illustrate , one of the patients identified by @entity8 to be in this category was a patient admitted into one of @entity137 ’s specialist services with a condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis , which is known to have a mortality in excess of 50 per cent			1
' under dr @entity8 ’s methodology , this condition is classified as an allergy and therefore treated as ‘ low clinical risk ’			1
there are many similar examples			0
' the report also found that death rates at three of the 12 hospitals have been consistently high for three years running			1
@entity91 , the @entity186 and @entity187 in @entity188 had high death rates three years in a row			1
authors of the @entity8 report had alerted authorities to problems at the @entity79 - where the deaths rates were also high for a number of years			2
the dr @entity8 report has warned death rates at a dozen trusts are alarmingly high			1
it has warned ' quality must be put over cost or there will be another @entity79 situation ' , where 1200 patients died due to a lack of care @entity208 , chief executive at @entity209 , said the trust commissioned an external review of its historically high mortality rates last year and acknowledged the figures had been ' unacceptably high			1
' he added : ' we are obviously pleased with the improvements in mortality rates seen so far this year and it is testament to the efforts of all our staff , but we are still some distance from where we want to be			2
' a spokesman for the @entity186 said it took mortality indicators very seriously and recent reports had suggested ' a significant and sustained improvement			0
' but the @entity91 strongly denied that it had a higher than expected mortality rate and questioned whether the hospital guide reflected new ways of operating			0
medical director @entity232 said : ' the title says it all			0
this is a hospital guide , but our care is also delivered at home , in the community and in a hospice			0
to be effective it is important to compare like with like			0
' dr @entity8 's director of research , @entity242 , said : ' given the current pressures on @entity7 budgets , it is no longer enough to just provide good quality care			1
' of course the best possible patient outcomes will always be of paramount importance			0
we have shown that there are a small number of trusts that are able to deliver high quality care in an efficient way which other hospitals should learn from			2

dr @entity8 , the @entity7 watchdog , found 12 trusts have ' worryingly high ' death rates
for 48 weeks of the year most hospitals are more than 90 per cent full , ' *jeopardising* patient care '
a third of beds are taken by patients who could be cared for elsewhere
if cost continues to be put over quality , ' patients will be in danger ' it warns
hospitals are *regularly* breaching an *85* per cent bed occupancy limit set in place specifically to *protect* patients .
12 hospitals were reporting too many deaths after surgery and too many deaths of patients who were admitted for minor ailments or ' low - risk conditions '
as *people* got older , their quality of care in hospital ' *declined* '
a third of hospital beds were being taken up by patients who could have been cared for elsewhere
there are higher ' mortality rates ' - or deaths - at *weekends*
