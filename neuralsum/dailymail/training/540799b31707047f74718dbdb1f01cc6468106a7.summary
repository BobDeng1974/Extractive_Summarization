is @entity1 right to be angry over birthday snub ? is @entity1 right to be angry over birthday snub ? now share your opinion @entity1 risks further enraging @entity6 after admitting he wants to end his career at @entity8 and could leave the club this summer			1
the 31 - year - old 's future at the @entity11 is shrouded in doubt after a bizarre episode on tuesday when his agent @entity14 launched an inexplicable attack on the @entity17 champions			1
the @entity18 claimed @entity1 - who cost @entity6 £ 24million four years ago - was ready to leave after the club ' snubbed ' his birthday last week			1
asked on @entity42 whether he could be playing for another club : ' yes , i have talked before about ending my career at @entity8 - but we do n't know because football is moving fast and you never know about tomorrow			1
' because of the brilliant season @entity6 have had , everybody is talking about me and everything is open and we do n't know tomorrow			1
' worryingly for @entity6 fans - who face the prospect of losing their talisman on a triviality - the @entity52 reiterated his endorsement of @entity14 's actions			1
' @entity14 is always on the phone and he knows what he has to do because i trust him a lot , ' he added			2
' the main thing now is just to try and focus on the @entity65 and he knows what he has to do because we were always open about everything and i am able to talk with him for a couple of days now			0
' @entity1 and @entity14 's relationship is a strong one ; the player has been under him for the majority of his career , calls him ' dad ' and named his second child after him			1
sticking the knife in ? @entity1 's cake was dwarfed by that of @entity6 's owners celebrating the title sliding in : despite the outburst , @entity1 is paid handsomely by @entity6 , north of £ 200,000 - a - week and they are no strangers to causing mischief within @entity86			1
@entity14 has overtly poked @entity6 enough in the past to cajole more money for his client in the past			1
@entity1 is now sitting on more than £ 200,000 - a - week and accused the club of treating him as a ' nobody ' at a party attended by owner @entity94 and other dignitaries in @entity96 last tuesday			1
complaints over a lack of a birthday cake by the central midfielder 's representative stretch the truth somewhat ; he was handed two - one on a flight and another at the team 's hotel - while a @entity107 message received 250,000 ' likes ' from supporters			1
there is a sense in the @entity111 that , although he is seen as a peripheral figure , @entity14 ca n't help himself			2
and that became even more apparent when he went full throttle in the media this week			0
fast car : @entity14 noted that @entity117 was bought a @entity118 by @entity120 club @entity119 on his birthday ‘ there is a big possibility that @entity1 will leave this summer , ’ @entity14 said			1
‘ he is very upset			0
what happened at his birthday means the club do n’t care about him			0
‘ in a normal team , his team - mates and club would at least give him good wishes			0
but when you have a big party to celebrate the title and no one comes to @entity1 to say , " @entity136 " , what more do you want ? ‘ he got a cake but when it was @entity117 ’s birthday , the president of @entity119 gave him a @entity118			2
snub : toure was upset by @entity143 not giving him a birthday message ‘ the club ’s owners ate a 100kg cake after winning the @entity17 but when they and the players were all together , none of them shook his hand on his birthday			2
it shows they do n’t care about him			0
this is n’t about a new contract — it ’s about human relationships and @entity6 have shown they do n’t respect him			2
‘ if a player like @entity1 went to @entity156 and they won the league for the first time in 24 years , @entity1 would be a god in @entity156			1
but at @entity159 is no hero			0
that ’s how the club make him feel			0
‘ he ’s very upset and he started thinking about leaving the club			0
and he will if things carry on like this			0
if you ask 100 per cent or 50 - 50 , better 50 - 50 than 100			0
this is not about money			0
in fact , he would take less to return to @entity8			2
all the staff at @entity8 , and players , liked him			0
he felt like @entity8 was his home			0

@entity1 could leave @entity6 before the next @entity17 season
@entity52 midfielder 's agent @entity14 said he was *unhappy*
@entity14 claimed @entity1 was treated like a ' nobody ' last week
@entity6 bought the 31 - year - old for £ 24m from @entity8 four years ago
