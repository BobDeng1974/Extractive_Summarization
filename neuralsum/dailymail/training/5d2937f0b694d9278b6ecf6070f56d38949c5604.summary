she 's the darling of the @entity2 film scene , a successful model and the brains behind her own philanthropic foundation			1
now @entity7 has revealed that she 's determined to ensure that poverty - stricken @entity9 girls get the education they deserve - and has teamed up with shoe supremo @entity11 to make it happen			1
but there 's more to @entity7 than acting and charity campaigns			2
a self - confessed nerd , she says that the current trend for teenage girls to value looks over brains is worrying and she hopes that they will realise that in life , intelligence is just as important as good looks			1
values : @entity2 actress @entity7 says it 's time to stop obsessing about looks and start valuing brains ' life always ends up teaching us , one way or another , that without depth , beauty is worth very little , ' she explains in an exclusive interview with @entity32			1
' it 's much better to start being curious and asking questions about the world early on			2
' the mother of a one - year - old son @entity39 , @entity7 is outspoken about raising her son to respect women - and would even describe herself a feminist			2
' i am a feminist in the sense that i believe that women are entitled the same rights and opportunities as men and are of equal value , ' she says firmly			0
' i will always be grateful to those women who fought for this , as i feel completely equal and i will do all i can to help women around the world to achieve the same			0
' successful : self - confessed nerd @entity7 says that much of her success is down to using her brain passion : the @entity55 aims to provide supplementary education for @entity9 's poorest people to that end , she has set up the @entity55 , which provides after - school tuition to girls and boys in @entity9 - a country close to the part - @entity65 's heart			1
' in @entity9 , women can work outside the home , go to school and university , and are free to vote or run in elections , ' she explains			1
' but in education and the labour market , women still lag behind			0
women are four times more likely to be unemployed than men			0
' keeping track of women 's progress in the country is difficult because , as @entity7 points out , the majority either work at home or have an informal role in the work place			0
this is something that she hopes to fix and to that end , she is currently working on a campaign to raise awareness of their plight and funds to support her foundation 's work - all with a little help from @entity11			1
helpful friends : @entity11 has joined @entity7 in her latest campaign to boost the profile of her charity exciting stuff : @entity7 hopes that her charity will be able to help more children go to school like this group together , the pair are running a social media campaign which encourages women to post pictures of themselves and their shoes on @entity109 and make a donation at the same time			1
those with the most exciting pair of shoes will be entered into a competition to win an all - expenses paid trip to @entity117 to tour @entity11 's studio , escorted by @entity7			0
her charitable ambitions , always bubbling under the surface , have become more urgent since becoming a mother in part , she says , because of the way parenthood has turned her into a more empathetic person			0
' becoming a mother has given me more empathy , ' she beams			0
' more understanding , more tolerance with myself and others			0
its a thrilling experience to rediscover the world through his eyes ' nevertheless , despite being a good example of a woman who has used her brains as well as her beauty to get ahead , she remains concerned about the way celebrity is fetishised and seen as an end in itself by today 's teenagers			1
' celebrity is by no means a goal in itself , ' she says			2
' unfortunately i feel young people are confused about this today			0
' the most important is being able to do what makes you happy - not having a paparazzi chasing you			0
' @entity154 plans : @entity7 , who says becoming a mother made her more empathetic , says celebrity is not a real goal set up to provide creative after - school activities to deprived @entity9 children , the @entity55 is now an important part of the actress ' life			1
focusing on cultural exchange and life skills , the charity aims to give girls ' education a boost in a country where many women still lack the life chances of their male counterparts			1
celebrity supporters include @entity11 , who has teamed up with @entity7 for a new campaign to raise funds for the charity , and is offering a prize of an all - expenses paid trip to his @entity117 atelier , a signed pair of stilettos and a luxury spa experience for one lucky winner			2
