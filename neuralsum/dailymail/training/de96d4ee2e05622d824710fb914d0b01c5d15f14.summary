by @entity0 the quotation , painted in bright yellow , is emblazoned in the window of @entity4 , an unassuming bakery shop in @entity6 , a @entity7 enclave on the outskirts of @entity9			1
we ’ll see if teas and buns can make the world a better place			1
’ for 22 years @entity4 , set up by husband and wife @entity15 and @entity16 , has been true to that cheerful sentiment from children ’s classic @entity22			1
in the fiercely sectarian district where the bakery operates , the @entity23 are proud to serve @entity26 and @entity7			1
but in the past two weeks , they have been at the centre of an extraordinary row , which has been raised at @entity31 ’s questions and debated on radio talk - shows as far afield as @entity33 and the @entity34 row : @entity35 , 24 , manager of @entity37 , and wife @entity38 , insist they never meant to cause offence by refusing to bake the cake the bakery ’s name is derived from @entity44 who , in the @entity45 , is one of the 12 sons of @entity47 and forebear of one of the tribes of @entity51			1
it was predicted that @entity44 ’s ‘ food would be rich ’ and he ‘ would provide delicacies fit for a king ’			1
the @entity57 reference is an indication of @entity59 and mrs @entity16 ’s @entity61 faith : both are devout @entity63			1
and that ’s the root of the row			1
their difficulties began when they took an order for an iced cake for @entity70 , a former mayor of @entity71 , for a municipal gathering in support of the @entity74			1
the specifications were for images of @entity77 ( puppets from television show @entity79 ) , the logo of @entity81 , a gay rights campaign group , and the slogan : @entity85			1
ever since the @entity23 rejected the order on the basis that same - sex marriage is against their @entity61 faith , they have been subjected to a torrent of abuse on social networking forums			1
the @entity94 , @entity95 ( @entity96 ) , funded by the @entity98 taxpayer , is now threatening to prosecute them and is demanding compensation for the would - be customers			1
in response , a national fighting fund for @entity4 has been launched by the @entity104 , which has received almost 6,000 messages of support			2
the bakers are far from alone in opposing same - sex marriage in @entity109 — legalising gay marriage has been rejected three times by the @entity95 assembly			1
the dispute has echoes of @entity61 couple @entity115 and @entity116 , who refused to give two gay men a double bedroom in their guesthouse in @entity120			1
the @entity121 eventually ruled the rights of the couple outweighed the @entity61 conscience of the @entity125			2
@entity126 , deputy president of the court , declared : ‘ we should be slow to accept ’ the rights of @entity130 to discriminate against gays			2
but last month , @entity126 suggested her initial judgment might have been wrong , refused to make an order for costs against the @entity125 , and floated the idea of inserting a ‘ christian conscience clause ’ into the equality legislation passed by the last @entity138 government			1
despite this , the @entity96 is pressing ahead with its action against the bakers , alleging they are ‘ acting unlawfully			2
under the 2006 @entity143 , which prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods and services on the grounds of sexual orientation ’			2
but is this politically motivated ? last year , the commission threatened a printing company because it declined to have anything to do with the launch of a gay magazine , of which more later			2
the @entity23 , whose family have been bakers for a century , have received hundreds of messages of support from across the globe			1
specifications : the initial request for the ' @entity85 ' cake was to have @entity79 puppets arm - in - arm in the family ’s only interview , @entity35 , 24 , the eldest of three sons — who runs the business because his parents are semi-retired — insists they never set out to cause any offence			1
‘ my mum took the order when the customer came into one of the shops knowing it would be problematic			2
as she did not want to embarrass the customer , she said nothing , ’ he explains			2
‘ after the shop closed , we talked about it as a family , weighing up what our conscience told us against the risk our response might get some public attention			1
‘ as we do n’t believe in gay marriage , and did not want to be associated with a politicised campaign , mum phoned the customer to explain politely that we could not accept the order , and would be returning his deposit			2
‘ she explained how we have turned down orders when they involved swear - words , nudity , or images that go against our faith			2
‘ we never thought we could be prosecuted for our beliefs			2
we are not discriminating against gay people			2
our church ’s definition of marriage is clear : it ’s a covenant between a man and a woman , a 6,000 - year - old tradition , which is ordained by @entity210			2
sexual activity outside marriage is a sin			2
’ @entity35 does not look or sound like a religious fanatic			1
at university , he was friendly with gay students and says his family have homosexual acquaintances			1
‘ we have gay customers			2
we are happy to serve them , ’ he says			2
this week , the family made me very welcome , knowing i ’m gay and in a civil partnership			1
‘ i have no problem in you coming into our home , ’ @entity35 told me			1
‘ we are just unwilling to endorse gay marriage			0
’ @entity35 , wife @entity38 , 25 , and one - year - old daughter @entity227 , live in @entity228 , which has @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and catholic churches			1
@entity234 , the local @entity235 mp , a noted gospel singer , was one of nine of the province ’s 13 @entity237 who voted against gay marriage			0
@entity35 has a degree in aeronautical engineering from @entity242 , @entity9 , but joined the business as it was expanding , and runs the commercial side			1
there are six outlets , including a factory			0
he met @entity38 , now pregnant with their second child , on a religious mission with the poor in the @entity252			0
the family are members of the @entity255 and talked over the cake order with its elders and minister			1
‘ they told us we were making the right decision , ’ says @entity35			1
so do their staff share their views ? ‘ out of 62 staff , five are churchgoing @entity130 , ’ he says			0
‘ most had no idea about our faith			0
’ @entity35 is bemused by the legal threat			1
‘ the commission talks about discrimination on the grounds of disability , race and sexuality , but never against people ’s @entity61 beliefs			0
why ? ’ ‘ in its letter , they found us guilty without giving us any chance to put our side across			0
what sort of justice is that ? i am sorry for any distress we have caused but we are staying true to our beliefs			0
we pray that @entity210 will give us the strength to fight this			0
’ beliefs : the bakery , which was set up 22 years ago , is located in a @entity7 enclave of @entity9 while they have been buoyed by messages of support , there have been critical and abusive messages on the company ’s facebook page			1
one man wrote : ‘ absolutely unjustified and disgusting			0
i know hundreds of people who will deliberately go out of their way to avoid your products			0
’ another added : ‘ disgusting attitude of ignorance and bigotry			0
’ but others rallied to their cause			0
in a letter to a local paper , the @entity314 , @entity315 , from @entity316 , @entity317 , wrote about an identical case in his home city			0
‘ @entity323 bakery deserves the unstinting support of @entity95 for its commitment to @entity61 principles , ’ he said			1
there was a similar divergence of views among shoppers outside the @entity323 stores , where queues form daily for their soda bread			1
@entity334 , a pensioner , says : ‘ while some will say they are being old - fashioned , it ’s not their views which count but those of the @entity340			0
’ @entity341 , whose sister is gay , says : ‘ i know many @entity130 who are gay			0
it is terrible that the bakery is being discriminatory against gay couples			1
’ but @entity347 says : ‘ our church pastor says if you go into a pub the management has a right to refuse to serve you			0
what ’s the difference ? ’ an hour ’s drive away in @entity357 , @entity358 , 29 , had his own run - in with the @entity360 last year			0
his printing company @entity361 was approached by the editor of a gay magazine for a quote to publish their first edition			0
‘ they gave me a link to their website which contained a number of explicit images , ’ says @entity358			0
‘ i am a @entity61 , and did not feel i could provide the quotation			0
’ there was a complaint to the @entity96 but @entity358 stood firm			0
‘ i do n’t think @entity130 are given a fair deal from equality laws			0
our rights and faith are trampled on			0
it ’s time we stood up to the bullying			0
’ in the end , the commission dropped its threat of legal action			0
this week , it refused to discuss the @entity4 case , although it said in a statement : ‘ the @entity96 provides assistance to people who complain they have suffered unlawful discrimination			1
the commission has granted assistance to the complainant and will consider any response before taking any further action			0
’ while @entity109 ’s politicians have voted against same - sex marriage , the @entity96 is in favour			0
its website states : ‘ the commission supports the introduction of legislation permitting same - sex marriage			0
with sufficient safeguards for religious organisations			0
’ but not , it seems , for small @entity61 bakeries .			0
