by @entity0 last updated at 12:42 pm on 30th august 2011 the @entity2 president , @entity1 , is believed to have scuppered talks held between @entity5 and @entity6 officials secret talks between representatives of the @entity5 and the @entity6 were closing in on a deal to free a kidnapped army sergeant , but were scuppered when @entity1 's aides leaked information about them			1
both @entity5 and @entity2 officials confirmed that the 54 - year - old @entity2 president kiboshed potential horse - trading with the @entity6 , as he feared being out of the loop			1
though the discussions , held in @entity22 and @entity23 , were only at a preliminary stage , a trade which would see sergeant @entity18 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , captured two years ago , was mooted			0
in return , the talks centred on the release of a number of @entity2 prisoners held at @entity30 in @entity31 , as well as the @entity33 airbase			1
but before any deals could be firmed up , mr @entity1 's aided leaked knowledge of the talks to the press , and all hope of striking a clandestine agreement were gone			0
the @entity2 president felt as though he was being undercut , according to @entity5 officials close to the deals			1
according to an unnamed senior @entity45 diplomat in the region a childhood friend of his , @entity42 , was the @entity6 negotiator			2
since the secret talks were discovered , mr @entity42 has fled and gone in to hiding , for fear of his life , but to the chagrin of the negotiators who have been left to rue mr @entity1 's reported intervention			0
the @entity5 negotiators asked mr @entity42 what could be done to gain @entity18 's release			0
the discussion did not get into specifics but it is understood mr @entity42 suggested - by way of a trade - the release of @entity2 prisoners at @entity30 and at @entity62			1
collapse of the direct talks between mr @entity42 and @entity5 officials probably spoiled the best chance yet at reaching @entity67 , considered the linchpin to ending the @entity6 fight against the @entity5 - backed government in @entity2			1
the @entity5 officials were trying to negotiate the release of sergeant @entity18 , who was captured two years ago ( left ) and @entity42 , shown here in 2001 ( right ) , was thought to be representing the @entity6 in the negotiations but has now fled to @entity74 perhaps most importantly they offered the tantalising prospect of a brokered agreement between the @entity5 and the @entity6 - one that would allow the larger reconciliation of the @entity6 into @entity2 political life to move forward			1
the @entity5 has not committed to any such deal , but the @entity6 wants security assurances from @entity81			2
in a series of interviews with diplomats , current and former @entity6 , @entity2 government officials and a close childhood friend of mr @entity42 , the information suggests that the man who was brokering the deals for the @entity6 is now hiding in @entity74 , and is afraid to return to @entity90 fearing reprisals			1
the @entity5 , for example , has had no direct contact with him for months			0
a senior @entity5 official acknowledged that the talks imploded because of the leak and that mr @entity42 , while alive , had disappeared			0
officials had been hoping that the negotiations would lead them to the @entity6 's supreme leader , mullah @entity67 while the @entity5 will continue to pursue talks , the trust of such meetings have been affected			1
the @entity5 acknowledged the meetings after mr @entity1 , who apparently fears being sidelined by @entity5 - @entity6 talks , confirmed published accounts about them in june , but has never publicly detailed the content , format or participants			2
the first was held in late 2010 followed by at least two other meetings in early spring of this year , and the sessions were held in @entity22 and @entity23 , the unnamed official said			0
the childhood friend of mr @entity42 's said the negotiator had fled to @entity22 and a diplomat in the region said he exited to a @entity74 country after his contacts with the @entity5 were revealed			0
the talks were deliberately revealed by someone in the presidential palace , where mr @entity1 's office is located , said a @entity45 and an @entity2 official			2
the reason was mr @entity1 's animosity toward the @entity5 and fear that any agreement @entity81 brokered would undermine his authority , they said			0
@entity90 had also been kept in the dark about the talks and an @entity2 official with contacts with the @entity6 said the insurgents decided not to tell @entity90 about the meetings with the @entity5			1
at the time of the leak , @entity81 had already offered small concessions as ' confidence - building measures ' , a former senior @entity5 official said			0
they were aimed at developing a rapport and moving talks forward , said a current @entity5 official on condition he not be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic			0
the concessions included treating the @entity6 and @entity150 differently under international sanctions			2
the @entity6 had argued that while @entity150 is focused on worldwide jihad against the @entity154 , @entity6 militants have focused on @entity2 and have shown little interest in attacking targets abroad			1
other goodwill gestures that were not made public included mr @entity42 's safe passage to @entity22 , @entity5 officials said			0
the @entity5 also offered assurances that it would not block the @entity6 from opening an office in a third country , the official said			2
mr @entity42 had been hoping for the release of some @entity2 prisoners from @entity30 in @entity31 a number of other @entity2 are being held at the @entity168 airbase , near @entity169 in @entity2 mr @entity42 slowly established his trust and reputation with the @entity5 officials , who had initial doubts both about his identity and his level of contact and influence with @entity67			1
he sought the freedom of @entity6 fighters in @entity5 custody in @entity30 and @entity33 airbase , north of the @entity2 capital where an estimated 600 @entity2 are being held			1
still at @entity30 is former @entity6 defense ministry chief of staff mullah @entity182 , @entity6 intelligence official @entity183 and former @entity185 governor @entity184			1
@entity2 's @entity186 tasked by mr @entity1 with finding a negotiated settlement with insurgents has requested @entity184 's release			1
a former @entity5 official familiar with the talks said the loss of the mr @entity42 contact dismayed and angered the @entity5 side , and further eroded thin trust in mr @entity1			0
there is a difference of opinion among @entity5 diplomats , military officials and others about how directly mr @entity1 should be blamed , but several officials agreed that the leak was an attempt to torpedo a diplomatic channel that he , and his inner circle , worried would sideline and undercut the @entity2 leader			1
as the @entity2 war rolls into its tenth year and @entity81 plans to withdraw its combat forces by the end of 2014 , a negotiated settlement between mr @entity1 's government and the @entity6 has become a target for the @entity5			1
an unnamed member of the @entity186 said that the leaking of the talks reveals the level of mistrust and the lack of coordination among the key players in any eventual peace deal			0
senator @entity223 has held talks recently , which have been behind closed doors he said all the key players - the @entity5 , @entity2 government , @entity2 @entity228 and the @entity186 - are holding separate and secret talks with their own contacts within the insurgency			2
the flurry of meetings the @entity5 is holding with the various factions in the @entity2 conflict has also extended to @entity90 , where the most powerful insurgents have found safe havens			2
a month ago , @entity5 @entity239 chairman , senator @entity223 , and @entity90 's @entity240 chief of staff general @entity241 met for a marathon eight hours in a @entity245 country			0
peace negotiations with @entity2 's insurgents featured prominently , and one @entity5 official said mr @entity241 made a pitch during his meeting with mr @entity223 that @entity90 take on a far larger role in @entity2 peacemaking			2
the @entity5 considers @entity90 an essential part of an eventual deal , but neither the @entity5 nor @entity90 trusts the other 's motives in @entity2			0
meanwhile , an unexpected consequence of attempts to find peace with the @entity6 has been the rearming of the so - called @entity261 , that represents @entity2 's ethnic minorities and who were partnered with the coalition at the outset of @entity266 to topple the @entity6 regime			1
for the warlords that make up the @entity261 , @entity270 , co-director and co-founder of the @entity272 in the capital , @entity169 , talk of peace threatens their survival			0
warlords - cum - government ministers and vice presidents are watching attempts at finding a peaceful end to the war with trepidation , each wondering , according to van @entity270 : ' what if it unravels , who is going to come after me , will i be the weakest in the room ? ' ' they are feeling very vulnerable , ' he added .			0

the release of @entity2 prisoners from @entity30 was also discussed
