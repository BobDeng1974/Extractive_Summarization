@entity0 , 56 , the mayor of @entity1 , claimed £ 4,500 per year from @entity2 , @entity3 , despite doing nothing for pupils a @entity7 mayor who campaigned against austerity while being paid an £ 80,000 salary took £ 4,500 per year from a school where he previously worked , despite doing nothing for pupils			1
@entity0 , 56 , the mayor of @entity1 , attempted to justify the payments by saying he provided the school with ' kudos ' for being linked to him			2
and when @entity2 in @entity16 , @entity3 , stopped the payments in 2011 , he attempted to sue them , claiming discrimination because of his ' philosophical belief ' in public service			1
the details of the case , published in @entity23 , came after mr @entity0 rejected an employment tribunal ruling against him and took his case to appeal , which was also rejected			2
in the most recent case , judge @entity26 ruled that outsiders would consider the payments a ' misapplication of public monies ' and that the school was right to stop them			0
he added that he had repeatedly asked mr @entity0 's lawyers to state what benefits the school got in return for their cash			0
he said : ' the only answer that i received was that it gave ' kudos ' to the school			0
' mr @entity0 had been a senior learning mentor at the school from 2001 , when he was already a @entity1 councillor			0
he eventually rose through the ranks to become full - time leader of the council in 2010 , effectively stopping his role as a mentor , but he continued taking payments from his former employer			1
when the school became an academy in 2011 , and therefore had greater freedom over its finances , it ceased paying mr @entity0 , leading to his discrimination claim			0
mr @entity0 , who is paid an £ 80,000 salary , tried to sue the school ( pictured ) for discrimination after it stopped the payments , saying he was being punished for a ' philosophical belief ' in public service mr @entity0 said that his claim was no about getting more money , but about protecting his lucrative public sector pension pot. a tribunal ruled that mr @entity0 was unfairly dismissed , but that it was ' 100 per cent likely ' the school would have sacked him following a consultation , so he was not entitled to compensation			1
it also ruled that , while mr @entity0 's belief in public service is a protected status , he had not been discriminated against .			2
