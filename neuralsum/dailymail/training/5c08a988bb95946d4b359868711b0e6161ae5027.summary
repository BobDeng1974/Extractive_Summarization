by @entity0 the eyes may be the window to the soul , but a smile can reveal more about a person than first thought			2
a body language expert has told @entity8 the tiniest tweak to a smile can change how a person is perceived - from looking up to appear flirtatious , to lowering the eyebrows to look more dominant and powerful , for example			1
dr @entity14 has pinpointed six types of smiles from the genuine ‘ @entity18 ’ , where the corners of the mouth are pulled up and the muscles around the eyes contract , to the knowing , wry smile			1
secret smiles : a body language expert has revealed the tiniest tweak to a smile can change how someone is perceived - from looking up to appear flirtatious ( as seen on @entity28 pictured left ) to lowering the brows to look more powerful , which could help you get ahead at work ( stock image pictured right ) while the ‘ raised - brow ’ smile suggests submission , keeping eyebrows level can make the smile more powerful , which could prove useful when negotiating a business deal , or in a job interview			1
‘ in the realm of facial expressions there ’s a big difference between lowered and raised eyebrows , with the former signalling dominance and the latter signalling submission , ’ dr @entity14 , a psychologist from @entity41 , said			1
‘ when someone smiles with both their eyebrows raised it shows that they do n’t want to dominate the situation and they want come across as unthreatening			2
’ a full smile is called a duchenne smile - after 19th century anatomist @entity18 , who produced a ground - breaking study of the muscles involved in facial expressions of emotion			2
the openness of the expression gives the impression that someone is genuine			0
a full smile is called a @entity18 smile and signifies that someone is open and genuine ( as modelled by @entity69 pictured left ) , while raising the eyebrows while smiling makes someone look submissive and non-threatening ( @entity72 is pictured right ) dr @entity14 added that the wide open smile is a ‘ clever way of getting other people to share one ’s positive feelings			1
' ‘ when someone tilts their head back slightly and opens their mouth wide they look like they are laughing rather than smiling			2
' because laughter is so contagious , those of us who see someone doing this are much more likely to be affected by the display and to feel that we share their positive emotions			2
’ meanwhile , the ‘ look - up ’ smile can be used to appear seductive and flirtatious			1
‘ some people have a habit of lowering their head slightly when they smile , ’ said dr @entity14			1
the wide open smile ( modelled on the left by @entity97 ) is a ‘ clever way of getting other people to share positive feelings ' as it looks as if the person is laughing , which is contagious , while the wry smile ( modelled by @entity105 , right ) is intimate and gives the impression they are sharing a secret with someone ‘ unconsciously , this gives the impression that they ’re shorter than they really are and that they ’re looking up towards the person they ’re addressing			2
' this , coupled with the suggestion of embarrassment , makes the look - up smile especially flirtatious , which explains why it ’s favoured by women when they ’re dealing with impressionable men			1
’ some people smile asymmetrically and when they look directly at someone , this wry smile can appear knowing and tells someone that you ’re aware of something , or that you share a secret			0
‘ smiles come in all shapes and sizes - some are involuntary , others deliberate , and they ’re linked to a rich vocabulary of subtle messages , ’ continued dr @entity14			1
a survey found that just over half of women think a smile is the most attractive trait in a man that they are meeting for the first time , while men also place more importance on a woman 's smile than her chest , bottom or legs ‘ by taking a closer look at how people smile we can gain a much better understanding of what they ’re feeling , and in some cases what kind of person they are			1
' and of course the same principle applies to your own smiles			0
’ a study of 2,000 people commissioned by @entity166 ’s @entity165 , found that just over half of women think a smile is the most attractive trait in a man that they are meeting for the first time			1
men also place more importance on a woman ’s smile than her chest , bottom or legs			0
however , 67 per cent of women and 53 per cent of men said that they worry about their smiles			1
the survey , released to coincide with the launch of @entity182 today , revealed that there ’s nothing better than someone directing a genuine smile straight at us to encourage us to return the favour			0
a total of 58 per cent of people smile when they receive a compliment , 37 percent when looking at family photos and one in five when they are praised at work			0
the survey revealed that 67 per cent of women and 53 per cent of men said that they worry about their smiles			1
this graph shows how often people smile a day , with women more likely to crack a grin than men up to twelve facial muscles are involved in smiling – slightly more , it ’s been observed , than the number of muscles involved in frowning			2
the most important of these are the @entity208 major muscles , which hoist up the corners of the mouth and expose the top teeth , the risorius muscles which pull the corners of the mouth sideways , and the orbicularis oculi which contract around the eyes , creating wrinkles outside the eyes			0
there are several things that distinguish fake smiles from genuine smiles			0
one is asymmetry , where the smile appears more on one side of the face than the other			0
another is the sudden appearance and disappearance of the smile			0
as a rule , genuine smiles involve the muscles around the mouth as well as the orbicularis oculi – those supposedly involuntary muscles around the eyes – whereas false smiles only involve the muscles around the mouth psychologists have discovered that women typically smile more than men , and men tend to reduce their smiling in order to appear more dominant			1
it ’s possible to spot someone ’s nationality from how they smile			0
@entity254 smiles , for example , concentrate on the @entity208 major muscles - the muscles that pull up the corners of the mouth and expose the top teeth - whereas @entity259 smiles often enlist the risorius muscles , which pull the corners of the mouth sideways , so that the lips remain sealed and the teeth are n’t exposed at all			0
the long - term positive effects of smiling were demonstrated by a study in @entity267			2
researchers analysed the photographs of a large sample of women who had appeared in a college yearbook in the late 1950s			0
they then contacted the women and interviewed them thirty years later			0
they found that those young students with the biggest smiles had gone on to have the most stable marriages in later life , and that they ’d also experienced fewer physical and psychological problems .			0
