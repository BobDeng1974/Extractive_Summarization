@entity0 of @entity1 may already be pregnant with her second child and plans to add another baby to the royal brood but one controversial feminist has slammed her decision , saying she 's ' too thin ' and should stop			1
@entity8 , who penned best - selling book @entity9 in 1970 , said that the former @entity10 , who gave birth to @entity12 last july , is ' too thin ' and should n't have any more children			1
speaking to @entity15 - based magazine @entity14 about @entity10 ’s chronic morning sickness , hyperemesis gravidarum , the 75 - year - old @entity18 said : ' the girl is too thin ! [ @entity10 ] is vomiting her guts up and should n’t have been made to go through all this again so soon			1
' it ’s not so much that she has to be a womb , but she has to be a mother			0
i would hope after this one she says , " that ’s it			0
affecting only two per cent of pregnant women , the sickness is so severe that sufferers end up dehydrated and weak			0
this often results in hospital admission - as it did when @entity10 was carrying her first child - for intravenous fluids and heavy - duty anti-sickness drugs			2
if that was n't enough , @entity8 added that 32 - year - old @entity10 had a ' b * * * * * d of a job ' because she had been ' put in charge of @entity47 '			1
she believes that @entity10 's interests have been limited by the royal family , which she dismisses as a ' mad anachronism ' , and argues that @entity10 has had to learn exactly how to behave , adding that spontaneity will get her in trouble			1
she also states that @entity10 , who graduated from @entity54 with a 2.1 honours degree in art history in 2005 , is a great deal more intelligent than the rest of the royals yet is ' made to appear absolutely anodyne '			1
@entity8 , a theorist , academic and journalist , is widely regarded as one of the mid-twentieth century 's most controversial feminist voices			2
she has penned numerous tomes , including @entity66 and @entity67 : the politics of @entity69 ( 1984 ) ; the change : women , ageing and the menopause ( 1991 ) and the @entity74 ( 1999 )			0
time to stop ? speaking about @entity10 , who is mother to one - year - old @entity12 and is already pregnant with baby number two , @entity8 said : ' [ @entity10 ] is vomiting her guts up and should n't have been made to go through all this again so soon			1
it 's not so much that she has to be a womb , but she has to be a mother			0
i would hope after this one she says , " that 's it			0
' she once defined her goal as ' women 's liberation ' as distinct from " equality with men ' and aims to promote the freedom of women to define their own values and determine their own fate			0
mouthpiece : @entity8 , a theorist , academic and journalist , is widely regarded as one of the mid-twentieth century 's most controversial feminist voices @entity98 left home in her youth due to conflict with her family			1
she tied the knot to @entity105 carpenter @entity104 in @entity106 in 1968 - but the marriage only lasted three - and - a - half weeks			0
@entity108 @entity8 actually met the @entity109 - and famously curtseyed - during a visit to @entity111 in 2006			2
the @entity109 was hosting a reception for @entity18 ahead of her royal tour , when she opened the @entity114 in @entity115			0
last weekend , the @entity0 was forced to pull out of a tour of @entity117 on behalf of the @entity109 , leaving prince @entity47 to stand in for her			2
@entity10 was also due to join @entity47 at an engagement in @entity119 three weeks ago but was too ill - and it was her absence that prompted the @entity111 to announce her pregnancy prematurely			1
however , according to royal aides , the @entity0 is planning to resume official engagements next month , with a spokesman telling @entity125 : ‘ there will be engagements in october and november			2
we just have n’t announced them yet			0
’ @entity0 has been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum – the condition she suffered during her pregnancy with @entity12			1
although she has not been admitted to hospital this time , she has received medical assistance at @entity134			0
the @entity136 ’s last official engagement was on august 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the @entity138 with her husband @entity47 and prince @entity140			1
over the summer she headed to @entity141 for @entity143 centenary commemorations and was in @entity144 in july for the start of the @entity146			0
but she has not carried out a charitable engagement since july , when went to a @entity106 school to see one of her @entity151 projects , and has told aides she is keen to revisit some of her charities			0
now that she is feeling better , the couple are expected to move into their new ten - bedroom @entity156 pile , @entity159 , in @entity160			0
taking pity ? @entity8 added that 32 - year - old @entity10 had a ' b * * * * * d of a job ' because she had been ' put in charge of @entity47 ' and her interests have been limited by the royal family business as usual : according to royal aides , the @entity0 is planning to resume official engagements next month hard at work : the duchess of @entity1 during a visit to @entity173 in @entity174 to mark the completion of a year - long restoration project in june this year ‘ while they will be predominantly living in @entity160 , the intention is for @entity10 to hop between @entity106 and @entity160 while looking after @entity12 , ’ said a source			1
three weeks after it was revealed the @entity136 and @entity10 are expecting a second child , some punters are placing sums of at least £ 1,000 on its name			2
and with speculation rife as to what prince @entity47 and @entity10 will call their new child , one of the most authoritative of royal authors claimed today that he is convinced they will name it after @entity192			1
@entity193 - who wrote a biography of the @entity192 which revealed the truth behind her strained royal relationships - said a daughter would be given the name @entity199			0
@entity10 ’s latest pregnancy was announced on september 8 , as it was revealed she was suffering from very acute morning sickness and being treated by doctors at @entity134			1
the couple are choosing to base their family in @entity160 , but the new baby will be delivered at @entity207 in @entity208 , central @entity106 , where @entity12 was born in july 2013 .			2

@entity8 said @entity10 is ' too thin ' and should n't have more children
@entity10 had a ' b * * * * * d of a job ' because she ' been ' put in charge of @entity47 '
believes @entity10 's interests have been limited by the royal family
