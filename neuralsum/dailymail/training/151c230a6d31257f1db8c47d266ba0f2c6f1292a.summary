by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 12:39 est , 11 october 2013 a stunning image of the @entity2 has been taken by @entity4 ’s @entity3 as it did a slingshot manoeuvre around the planet			1
the probe was able to send the image despite unexpectedly going into ‘ safe mode ’			1
@entity3 sped up from 78,000 mph relative to the sun to 87,000 mph - enough momentum to cruise past the asteroid belt to @entity14 , where it should arrive in 2016			1
@entity3 was due to be flying over @entity24 and the southern @entity25 the $ 1.1 billion spacecraft will use nine instruments to probe deep inside @entity14 and reveal glimpses into the planet 's origin			1
on wednesday , the solar - powered , windmill - shaped spacecraft slipped into @entity2 's shadow as planned , but engineers were puzzled when it emerged			1
at closest approach , it hurtled 350 miles above the ocean off the coast of @entity39			1
the space agency later learned that @entity3 had entered safe mode - a state that spacecraft are programmed to go into when they sense there 's a problem			1
the @entity3 mission will use nine instruments to probe inside @entity14 and reveal glimpses into the planet 's origin this day side raw image of @entity2 is one of the 1st snapshots transmitted back to us by @entity3			1
it was taken with the @entity55 imager and methane filter at 12:06:30 pdt ( 19:06 gmt ) and an exposure time of 3.2 milliseconds @entity3 is a @entity59 mission to the planet @entity14			2
the probe cost $ 1.1 billion and was launched in 2011			0
the windmill - shaped spacecraft travels at 78,000 mph			2
it has nine instruments to investigate @entity14 ’s gravity field , magnetic field , and polar magnetosphere			0
@entity3 will also search for clues about how @entity14 formed , including whether the planet has a rocky core			2
it will also study @entity14 's deep winds , which can reach speeds of 384 mph			2
the spacecraft 's name comes from @entity75			0
the god @entity14 drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief , but his wife , the goddess @entity21 , was able to peer through the clouds and see @entity14 's true nature			0
@entity4 said skywatchers with binoculars or a small telescope might have seen it streak across the sky , weather permitting			0
ham radio operators around the globe were encouraged to say ‘ hi ’ in @entity90 - a message that might be detected by @entity3 's radio			1
up until wednesday , when @entity3 whipped around @entity2 in a momentum - gathering flyby , the spacecraft had been performed without problems			2
previous missions to the outer solar system have used @entity2 as a gravity slingshot since there 's no rocket powerful enough to make a direct flight			0
the @entity105 spacecraft buzzed by @entity2 twice in the 1990s en route to @entity14 , the solar system 's largest planet located 484 million miles from the sun. launched in 2011 , @entity3 flew beyond the orbit of @entity109 , @entity2 's closest planetary neighbour , before looping back toward our home planet for a quick visit			1
by space mission standards , @entity3 's @entity2 rendezvous was low - key compared with the @entity116 's nail - biting landing on @entity109 last year , which drew crowds			2
since flybys have been executed before , project managers predicted a smooth flight			0
despite a government shutdown that has prevented @entity4 from updating its website or tweeting , the space agency 's missions continue to operate			0
earlier this week , @entity4 ’s newest spacecraft , @entity126 , slipped into orbit around the moon			0
since the 1970s , spacecraft have circled or flown past @entity14 including the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity105 , @entity132 , @entity133 and , most recently , the @entity134 barreling toward @entity135			0
missions have beamed back stunning views of @entity14 's trademark @entity138 , a raging hurricane - like storm , and its many moons			0
@entity3 promises to inch closer to @entity14 than previous spacecraft , orbiting the planet for at least a year and studying its cloud - covered atmosphere and mysterious interior to better understand how the giant planet formed			0
@entity3 's trajectory has carried it beyond the orbit of @entity109 and then back into the inner solar system where it did a velocity boosting @entity2 flyby on wednesday to gain the energy needed to reach @entity14			1

the probe sent the image despite unexpectedly going into ‘ safe mode ’
the @entity2 's gravity helped @entity3 speed up from 78,000 mph to 87,000 mph
at its closest approach , it hurtled 350 miles above @entity39
the probe is now on its way to @entity14 , where it should arrive in 2016
