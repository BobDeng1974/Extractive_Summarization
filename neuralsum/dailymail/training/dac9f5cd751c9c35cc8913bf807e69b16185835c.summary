new fury as £ 1m - a - year star of @entity1 says ' let foxy woxy eat the gooey parts ' of rail suicide victims he denies that he apologised for saying strikers ' should be shot ' @entity9 insiders are concerned about his state of mind and fear marriage is finally over by @entity12 and @entity13 last updated at 2:28 pm on 4th december 2011 flying into fresh controversy : presenter @entity15 pictured at @entity16 on thursday there were growing concerns yesterday about @entity15 ’s ‘ vulnerable state of mind ’ and the precarious state of his 18 - year marriage after he provoked a fresh storm of protest			1
the @entity1 presenter made offensive comments about people who commit suicide – the second time that he has been at the centre of controversy in the space of a few days			1
one senior @entity9 insider , who asked not to be named , last night said @entity15 had moved out of the family home he shares with second wife @entity34 and was n’t in ‘ the best possible place at the moment ’			1
he said : ‘ there is a feeling that he ’s in a more vulnerable state than he should be and that ’s why his judgment is n’t a-grade at the moment			1
’ @entity15 , who is reportedly paid £ 1million a year by the @entity9 , used his weekly column in @entity46 newspaper to expand on comments he had made about suicide on @entity49 on wednesday night			1
he wrote that ‘ foxy woxy and the birds ’ should be left to ‘ nibble ’ at the ‘ gooey parts ’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains			1
last night three of the country ’s leading mental health charities said they would complain to the @entity59 about the remarks , which they said intruded on private grief and breached @entity59 guidelines which restrict what newspapers can report about suicides for fear of encouraging copycat incidents			1
@entity15 , 51 , had already provoked uproar on wednesday by joking on @entity49 about suicides and then calling for striking public sector workers to be shot in front of their families			1
@entity49 immediately issued an on - air apology for the star ’s remarks about suicide but did not address his comments about strikers			1
the @entity9 subsequently apologised over the remarks about the strikers , after it received more than 21,000 complaints			1
it was widely assumed that @entity15 had also apologised for the remarks			2
but he denied having done so in his column yesterday			0
corporation bosses had hoped the apologies would draw a line under the storm but @entity15 ’s decision to return to the subject of what he called ‘ @entity92 ’ in his newspaper column has only plunged him deeper into controversy			0
@entity94 , chief executive of mental health charity mind , said : ‘ @entity15 ’s article in @entity46 is extraordinarily tasteless and shows an utter lack of understanding of the tragedy of any suicide			1
‘ many people who have contemplated suicide seriously or lost loved ones will be shocked by his insensitive tone and needless graphic detail			2
’ under the heading ‘ think of the poor driver before your leap in front of @entity111 ’ , @entity15 said he had every sympathy with those who felt the need to take their own lives			0
but he went on to argue that suicide victims who ‘ hurled ’ themselves in front of trains were self - ish and disruptive because they inconvenienced other members of the public			1
he wrote : ‘ it is a very selfish way to go because the disruption it causes is immense			0
and think of what it ’s like for the poor train driver who sees you lying on the line and can do absolutely nothing to avoid a collision			0
’ controversial : @entity15 makes his headline - hitting comment on @entity9 's @entity49 @entity15 then bemoans the fact that trains which are involved in a collision with a person must stop until the full aftermath of the incident has been dealt with and all remains have been recovered from the vicinity			1
he wrote : ‘ the train can not be moved nor the line re-opened until all of the victim ’s body has been recovered			0
‘ this is the part i do n’t understand			0
it ’s not like the poor soul is going to get any better			0
‘ change the driver , pick up the big bits of what ’s left of the victim , get the train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller , gooey parts that are far away or hard to find			1
’ @entity15 advises potential suicide victims to kill themselves quietly and privately			1
marriage problems : @entity15 with his second wife , @entity34			2
one @entity9 insider said the presenter has now moved out of the family home @entity163 , the chief executive of the @entity164 , which is campaigning to reduce the number of suicides on the railway network , said the comments in the column went beyond what he had said about suicide on @entity49 and were far worse than anything he had ever said about striking public sector workers			1
@entity15 's first wife : @entity175 married him in 1989 but the couple separated a year later she said : ‘ his notion that suicide is a selfish act shows how little he knows about the subject because , if he did , he would know that when a person attempts suicide they are so distressed that they genuinely believe their families will be better off without them			1
the fact that he has chosen to add fuel to the flames of the comments he made on @entity49 again beggars belief			0
‘ it ’s one thing to joke about people on strike , it ’s in an entirely different realm of poor taste to joke about suicide			2
’ @entity15 ’s column also sparked an avalanche of complaints on @entity200 and other social networking sites			0
one fan tweeted : ‘ please stop			0
shooting the strikers is one thing , but this is pretty indefensible			2
’ another added : ‘ really shocked by the “ train suicide ” comments			2
’ but there were some signs of support on @entity200 and elsewhere			0
rabbi dr @entity211 , of @entity212 , said : ‘ i am totally sympathetic to the black depression that overtakes those who commit suicide , and certainly want to prevent any future ones , but @entity15 has done us a favour by saying out aloud that while people have the right to end their lives , they should not do so in a way that scars others			2
’ news of @entity15 ’s marriage difficulties comes nine months after allegations surfaced that the presenter had been having a 14 - month affair with events organiser @entity230 , who works for a company which helped produce the @entity1 live show			1
two months later the millionaire presenter was forced to deny reports he had been thrown out of the marital home in @entity236 , @entity237 , by his wife after he wrote about the delights of living in an unfurnished flat in @entity241			0
a day later @entity15 said that he had simply been using the flat as a bolt - hole while he was filming in @entity241			2
the @entity9 last night declined to comment on @entity15 ’s column in yesterday ’s @entity46 a @entity9 spokesman was unable to comment on anything relating to the presenter ’s private life and was unable to reach @entity15 because he was in @entity248			1
rumour : @entity15 faced allegations that he had an affair with events organiser @entity230 ( pictured immediately in front of him by @entity252 one of the first rules of being a high - profile media talking head is that when you ’ve gone too far you apologise – and move on			2
but @entity15 appeared to be digging himself into a deeper hole yesterday when he denied that he had apologised for his comments about striking public sector workers			2
in his column in @entity46 , @entity15 insisted that while he had apologised for his remarks about suicide on @entity49 he had not said sorry for his demand that strikers should be shot			1
no regrets : @entity15 denied that he ever apologised for comments me made about striking public sector workers he wrote : ‘ according to @entity200 , @entity269 and all the other modern - day versions of the @entity271 , the @entity9 were forced to apologise this week after i went on @entity49 and said that all public service workers who went on strike should be executed in front of their families			1
‘ i backed the strikers and then , to make a point about the need for impartiality , said they should be shot			1
in fact , the @entity9 apologised about my later remarks about people who jump in front of trains			1
’ sources close to @entity15 have claimed that the presenter warned @entity49 production team about what he was intending to say on air in one of the regular briefing meetings immediately before transmission			0
they claim fault for the controversy lies not with @entity15 but with the @entity9 which allowed the item to go ahead			1
however , insiders on the programme , which is watched by five million viewers every night , dispute this			2
they insist that @entity15 was told that he should avoid anything that was likely to provoke controversy			0
one , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ every guest who comes on to @entity49 is briefed about the running order of the programme			0
it is a live programme which features topical news reports and it is only fair guests know what to expect			0
in the briefing , @entity15 did make reference to comments about shootings and killings as well as a load of other stuff			0
‘ the producer dealing with the briefing made it clear in no uncertain terms that @entity15 should avoid any comments that would be controversial			0
‘ he was also reminded of the need to ensure that his comments were balanced			0
@entity49 team member dealing with the briefing left that room assured that their advice had been taken onboard			0
‘ it is telling that when @entity15 did make the comments about the executions he very deliberately made a reference to balance			0
’ sources say that @entity49 production team were horrified by the comments and gave @entity15 the opportunity to apologise on air			0
insiders also say @entity15 was briefed on the show ’s running order four days earlier			2
the source said : ‘ he promised not to say anything controversial			0
his only concern was that he would finish the programme so he could make his plane to @entity248 on time			0
