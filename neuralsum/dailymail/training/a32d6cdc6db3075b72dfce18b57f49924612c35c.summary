@entity1 mayor @entity0 mocked the government plan to screen passengers arriving form ebola - hit countries @entity0 today ridiculed the government 's attempts to tackle the spread of @entity8 , accusing @entity9 of making promises which ' do n't really make any sense '			1
the @entity1 mayor said he could understand why the public was left baffled by the @entity15 announcement of plans to quiz air passengers arriving from @entity18 in an attempt to prevent the deadly virus entering the @entity21			1
mr @entity0 warned that ' eventually ' there would be a case of @entity8 in @entity21 , ' probably ' in @entity1 , but the focus should be on preparing for it not making announcements about screening which does not work			1
there is a growing sense of chaos surrounding government plans to screen passengers , with airlines insisting they are in the dark about how it will work in practice to halt the spread of the virus which has so far killed more than 4,000 people			1
with the incubation period for the disease as long as 21 days , it is feared the delay in introducing measures could mean the deadly virus is already in the @entity21			2
health secretary @entity43 is expected to use a @entity45 statement tomorrow to set out the timescale and details of the screening plan in the @entity21			1
it is expected to start by tuesday or wednesday , in line with how long it took the @entity52 to introduce its own screening programme last week			1
on thursday morning the @entity21 government ruled out screening passengers , with defence secretary @entity56 warning it would be ' very hard ' to track people arriving in the @entity21 from affected countries			1
but eight hours later @entity9 announced ' enhanced screening ' will be carried out at @entity60 and @entity61 , and @entity63 trains , for people arriving from @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
but far from reassuring voters , the lack of detail about the plans have added to the sense of confusion			1
mr @entity0 told @entity76 's @entity75 show : ' i understand why people do n't understand them			2
the difficulty is i think again it 's one of those cases where we are at risk of seeming to promise stuff that does n't really make any sense			2
' you ca n't blood test everybody coming in to the country			0
' there are no direct flights between @entity21 and the high risk areas , but it is possible to change in a third country			0
airport screening of people leaving airports in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 has been in place for several weeks			1
but following calls for checks on arrival in the @entity21 , the government suddenly changed its position on screening			1
a @entity15 source said today : ' it is important to stress that the decision to bring forward that additional screening was taken with the advice of the chief medical officer			1
' we are absolutely upfront about saying there is no magic solution for protecting the @entity21 from this			0
this is another layer to try to help			0
' medical teams at @entity117 's @entity116 , armed with @entity8 questionnaires and temperature guns , began screening travellers from three @entity18 countries yesterday			1
@entity116 is the first of five @entity52 airports to start enhanced screening of @entity52 - bound travellers from @entity67 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
medical teams at @entity117 's @entity116 , armed with @entity8 questionnaires and temperature guns , began screening travelers from three @entity18 countries yesterday 9.30am defence secretary @entity56 : ' we 're following the advice of the @entity131 , and the advice here of the chief medical officer , and the @entity131 advice is that it is better to screen on exit from a country to make sure people who are leaving are not infected , rather than trying to screen people who arrive			1
it 's very hard to be able to track people who are changing planes and arriving by different means in the @entity21			0
' 2pm chancellor @entity145 : ' if the medical advice is we need to screen - it might well be - then we will absolutely take that action			0
we are not going to do anything that puts the @entity21 population at risk			0
the steps we have taken for several months now have all been designed to protect @entity21 from this awful disease			0
5.30pm @entity15 : ' advice from the chief medical officer today is that enhanced screening arrangements at the @entity21 's main ports of entry for people travelling from the affected regions - @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 - will offer an additional level of protection to the @entity21			1
' but mr @entity0 insisted : ' i can only go on the advice i have been given and that is that although i think we are doing a lot more screening , we do n't think that temperature measures alone will be of any use			2
' because you could after all be in the early stages of incubation of the virus and have two or three weeks to run			0
' so the idea of screening at airports is far from perfect as a solution			2
' he stressed the focus should be on screening and testing people ' people coming from the affected countries '			2
he added : ' they should n't be allowed to leave if they have been in contact with people in one of the affected areas			0
' and obviously we should be putting on preparations in this country			0
i have little doubt that eventually there will be a case of @entity8 in this country and probably in this city			0
' we have fantastic preparations in @entity1 for this , we have very good healthcare in this city , considerably better , alas , obviously than they have alas in @entity18			1
' @entity206 's shadow health minister @entity205 said : ' people do n't want to see politicians on tv speculating about an @entity8 outbreak , before passing the buck			2
' after the past week they want reassurance that robust preparations are being made			0
@entity0 should focus on explaining what plans are in place			2
' airports , airlines and @entity63 have all said they are still waiting for instructions from the government about how its hastily - announced plans would be implemented in practice			1
@entity224 , the government body which had previously said screening would not be effective , is now in charge of the programme but said it had no more details of how it would work			1
meanwhile the @entity21 expert in charge of the @entity233 response to @entity8 has said he hopes the spread of the killer virus will be ' under control ' in three months			0
dr @entity237 , the @entity233 's special envoy on @entity8 , said the number of cases in west @entity18 countries including @entity66 were increasing week - on - week			0
but systems now put in place , along with international help from nations including @entity21 , could help turn the tide and reduce the number of cases from one week to the next , he told the @entity76 5live @entity249 's @entity248			0
staff from @entity252 and the @entity253 , @entity250 took part in an exercise on saturday aimed at showing the @entity256 could cope with an @entity8 outbreak if and when it reaches the @entity21 mr @entity0 insisted the @entity256 was well - prepared for the deadly virus and was better equipped than the @entity18 nations which are worst affected however dr @entity237 said screening people arriving at ports and airports was ' less necessary ' than screening on departure and singling out people because of their nationality or where they are travelling from was ' inappropriate '			2
he added : ' as a result of the sensitisation programme last month i think we have got a much better community involvement , which leads me to believe that getting it under control within the next three months is a reasonable target			0
' when we have a disease outbreak like this there is a thing called the epidemic curve , which is numbers of cases over time , and at the moment that epidemic curve is increasing in an exponential fashion ... this means an upward - going curve and it 's quite frightening because it means an acceleration			0
' by under control i mean we bend the curve down , the numbers of cases each week diminishes compared with the previous week to the point where there is no new transmissions			0
for me under control means the epidemic curve is coming down and we are confident that the numbers of cases is reducing and will be eventually ended			0

@entity1 mayor mocks plans for screening announced by the government
@entity15 ordered screening at @entity60 and @entity61 , and @entity63
came just eight hours after defence secretary @entity56 ruled it out
@entity61 , @entity60 and @entity63 still in the dark about how it will work
health secretary @entity43 expected to *outline* timescale tomorrow
