we 've got 10 minutes left ... can @entity4 find a way to equalise ? @entity4 will be blowing a sigh of relief as @entity3 boss @entity103 substitutes @entity25 for @entity104			1
@entity25 has been brilliant for the visitors and the travelling fans recognised this with a standing ovation			0

@entity4 are trying to increase the pressure again , just like during the first - half , but @entity3 are looking very comfortable and very good value for their lead			1
@entity3 are currently running riot at @entity5 and should be 3 - 1 up			2

will they rue these missed chances ? @entity25 deserves most of the credit for this goal			0
the @entity141 international wins the ball from @entity143 before getting to the byline and firing a low cross into the path of @entity0 who emphatically finds the net with an expert left - footed shot			1

half an hour played and the game has been an entertaining affair			0
@entity3 are soaking up the @entity4 pressure and hitting the hosts on the counter-attack on numerous occasions			2

@entity6 dwindling on the ball when the visitors breaking this time			0
@entity25 wreaking havoc down the wing , good to see the youngster in such good form			0
@entity0 all over former @entity227 teammate @entity11 at the moment , out sprinting him just minutes before rising above him for the header to assist the goal			2
meanwhile @entity3 fans taunt the home support - ' is this a library ? ' the hosts have come back into the game since going a goal behind but have yet to trouble @entity19 sufficiently			1
@entity3 are close to doubling their lead soon after but @entity25 has his stinging shot saved by @entity239			1
@entity0 2 - 0 @entity11			2
after blitzing @entity11 moments before , @entity0 beats the centre - back in the air to nod down for @entity6 to score past @entity239 in the @entity4 goal			1
@entity11 's diminishing pace has been spoken a lot and it was on evidence after eight minutes when @entity0 , not known for his speed , glides past the former @entity227 defender before over-hitting a cross out for a goal kick			1
@entity103 gets his first taste of the @entity5 faithful 's views on him , with the crowd chanting ' stand up if you hate @entity103 ! ' two years on since his sacking in 2012 and the wounds still have n't been healed it seems			2
@entity124 has the first shot on goal after 54 seconds but his tame strike is comfortably gathered by @entity19 in the @entity3 goal			1
@entity4 's @entity124 and @entity263 get proceedings started ... the last time both @entity4 and @entity3 were in the @entity9 , the @entity166 completed a double over the @entity64 outfit			1
victory today would see them achieve three wins in a row against the @entity269 for the first time since 1974			0
the hosts have played one and lost one at home so far this season , but hold an impressive record against their opponents at @entity5			2
@entity29 's side have won eight and lost just two of their last 13 home league games against the @entity166 ( @entity282 ) ever wondered what a @entity9 footballer 's matchday routine is before kick - off ? @entity4 revealed earlier on their official @entity288 account , what the professionals entail in the countdown to the match			2

former manager @entity103 , returning here for the first time since he was sacked by @entity317 in 2012 , got plenty of stick			0
