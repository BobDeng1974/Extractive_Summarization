almost 50 new @entity1 cases have erupted in @entity2 , harming the fight against an outbreak which has now infected more than 20,000 people across @entity6			1
medics had hoped they were finally beating the disease in @entity2 after infection rates began to fall last month amid a global disaster appeal			1
but today officials said 49 new cases had been identified in one part of one county - and they blamed them partly on the tradition of washing loved ones ' bodies before they are buried			1
scroll down for new death toll figures setback : 49 new @entity1 cases have erupted in one area of @entity2 , blamed partly on the tradition of washing loved ones ' bodies before they are buried			1
pictured : nurses carry out a safe burial in @entity2 ( file photo ) medics have been battling with locals to halt the tradition , which the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) previously said caused more than a fifth of fresh @entity1 cases			1
it has continued in some isolated communities where resources or health education are poor			0
@entity2 's assistant health minister , who detailed the new cases today , said the body - washing tradition was to blame alongside other factors such as people crossing the border to and from @entity45			1
speaking on state radio , @entity46 said the new cases had been reported between december 1 and @entity48 in the western part of @entity50			1
the region on the border with @entity45 had previously reported just 18 new @entity1 cases in the three weeks leading up to december 24 , the date of the @entity32 's latest full death toll update			1
@entity56 : @entity50 , where the new cases were seen , is on the @entity2 - @entity45 border			1
this @entity32 map shows the state of the disease across the main three affected countries as of december 24 mr @entity46 said : ' in a very small population , an increase in the number of cases raises high level of concerns that we need to take very seriously as people of @entity2 and people of @entity50 in particular			1
today the @entity32 confirmed more than 20,000 people have been infected since the start of the outbreak , with the death toll now standing at 7,842 worldwide			1
a new test which it is claimed can diagnose @entity1 in just three hours was approved today by @entity77 regulators			0
@entity79 pharmaceutical firm @entity78 said the @entity81 test would help medics fight the disease by drawing their attention away from false alarms and ensuring quick treatment			0
certain laboratories in the @entity77 and other countries are now authorised to use the test for a limited period to detect the type of @entity1 that has been spreading			0
it has not been approved by the @entity93 for general use			0
more than a third were laboratory - confirmed cases in @entity45 , which is now the worst - hit country			2
the 49 new cases in @entity2 represent a significant increase , however , because there were thought to have been just 121 new infections in the three weeks to december 24			1
the country where 3,384 people have died of @entity1 - more than any other nation - had been seeing a drop in the number of new infections since mid-november			2
part of the problem were religious customs in which family members wash a dead relative 's body before burial , exactly the point at which @entity1 is at its most infectious			0
last month the @entity32 's dr @entity114 said medics were ' building trust and respect between burial teams , bereaved families and religious groups '			2
he added : ' introducing components such as inviting the family to be involved in digging the grave and offering options for dry ablution and shrouding will make a significant difference			0
' in its @entity129 update , however , the @entity32 admitted there was still more work to be done			0
transmission : the markets of @entity134 , @entity2 's capital , had become safer places to be in recent weeks ' while every country has sufficient capacity to isolate patients , the uneven geographical distribution of beds and cases means shortfalls persist in some districts , ' a spokesman wrote			1
' each country has sufficient capacity to bury all people known to have died from @entity1 , although it is possible that capacity is inadequate in some districts			0
' @entity149 has pledged £ 230million to curb the outbreak in @entity6 , including sending @entity149 doctors and matching the first £ 5million of public donations pound - for - pound			0
officials have warned a failure to contain it could lead to it becoming an unstoppable outbreak , the way @entity157 did in the late 1970s and early 1980s			0
however , cases have so far largely been contained within @entity45 , @entity159 and @entity2			2
because of @entity2 's falling infection rate it has now been eclipsed by @entity45 , but @entity2 still has the record for the highest number of deaths			2
the most deadly previous outbreak in 1976 , the first ever recorded , infected 318 people and killed 280 in the country now known as the @entity168			2
