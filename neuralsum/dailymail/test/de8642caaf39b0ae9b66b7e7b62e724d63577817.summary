the @entity0 was under fire after vital details of the @entity4 's main base on the @entity5 were published on their website			1
the secret document , which has the exact gps co-ordinates of vital facilities as well as information on the depth of concrete on the runway were published unencrypted on the @entity0 's website			1
the details could be used as ' an invasion guide ' by @entity17 , with the technical information providing excellent intelligence to any @entity17 bombers sent to attack the islands			1
the @entity5 are defended by a squadron of @entity24 aircraft operating from @entity26 aerodrome on @entity27 , supported by a refueling tanker to extend their operational area the aerodrome also operates as a @entity32 location with @entity34 helicopters , pictured the airstrip , pictured , is home to four @entity38 aircraft tasked with defending the islands the @entity40 was accidentally uploaded onto a public section of the @entity0 's website and could have been downloaded by @entity17 intelligence agents to help prepare a mission to recapture the islands			1
a senior military source told @entity46 : ' this is exactly the kind of intel foreign powers send spies to get			0
' it 's practically an invasion handbook			0
taking out the runway could cripple @entity53 's ability to fight off invaders in the ongoing sovereignty dispute			0
' the @entity0 admitted the manual had been available on the internet but the link had been disabled			1
they denied the information was particularly sensitive			0
the blunder occurred as @entity17 was described as a ' very live threat ' by defence secretary @entity62			2
this comes as @entity17 is preparing to lease 12 @entity65 long - range bombers from @entity66			1
the @entity5 are defended by modern @entity68 aircraft , supported by @entity70 surface - to - air missiles and 1,200 troops			1
the @entity73 also patrols the area and nuclear - powered submarines are also thought regularly travel to the region			0
and the @entity0 recently announced the Â£ 228million purchase of new anti-aircraft missiles to boost island defences			2
the jets are housed in hangers just off the main runway where they can be airborne quickly to intercept any potential aircraft inbound from @entity17 in the event of a new conflict @entity17 is considering leasing 12 @entity88 bombers , pictured , from @entity66			1
the @entity90 - era jets have a range of 650 miles and would be able to bomb @entity26 without the need to refuel the @entity0 published the @entity40 on their website where it could be downloaded by anyone the @entity90 - era jet has a maximum range of 650 miles - which means it could attack the @entity5 and return to @entity17 without the need to refuel			1
it also can carry 3,000kg of bombs as well as air - to - air missiles			1
the jets , despite being designed in the 1960s , are also capable of supersonic travel			2
this comes as tensions between @entity53 and @entity17 have increased over plans by @entity53 firms to drill for oil in the @entity109			2
@entity17 's minister for the @entity111 - the name it uses for the @entity5 - @entity113 threatened to prosecute any @entity53 firms exploring for oil near the islands			2
he said : ' the new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk			0
' we want the owners of the companies to be tried according to @entity17 laws and international statutes			0
' a @entity126 spokesman said : ' we have always been very clear that this is an unlawful assertion of jurisdiction over the @entity5 ' continental shelf , which we reject , and we will raise it will the appropriate authorities			0
' we are satisfied that the @entity5 have the right to develop their hydrocarbons sector as a legitimate commercial venture with international oil and gas companies , and will continue to support them as they move forward			0
@entity17 domestic law does not apply to the @entity5			0

the @entity0 accidentally published information on @entity144 base *online*
@entity26 aerodrome is home to four @entity68 jets
@entity17 is considering leasing 12 @entity65 bombers from @entity66
the supersonic attack aircraft can carry 3,000kg of bombs 650 miles
