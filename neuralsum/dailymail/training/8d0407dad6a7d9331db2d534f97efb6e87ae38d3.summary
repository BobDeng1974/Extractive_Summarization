published : 13:05 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 13:06 est , 25 april 2013 the maya civilization is well - known for its elaborate temples , sophisticated writing system , and mathematical and astronomical developments - yet the civilization 's origins have remained something of a mystery			0
however , a newly discovered series of plazas and pyramids have revealed that the civilisation mixed with other early @entity13 cultures more than previously thought			1
archaeologists at the @entity15 say the find means ' early @entity17 culture is really more complex than we thought			1
' excavations at @entity21 , an ancient @entity17 site in @entity22 , suggest that the origins of early @entity17 civilization are more complex than previously thought anthropologists typically fall into one of two competing camps with regard to the origins of @entity0			1
the first camp believes that it developed almost entirely on its own in the jungles of what is now @entity22 and @entity33			2
the second believes that the @entity17 civilization developed as the result of direct influences from the older @entity39 civilization and its center of @entity41			2
' we 're saying that the scenario of early @entity17 culture is really more complex than we thought , ' said @entity46 graduate student @entity45 , who co-authored the paper in @entity48			1
' we have this idea of the origin of @entity0 as an indigenous development , and we have this other idea that it was an external influence that triggered the social complexity of @entity0			0
' we 're now thinking it 's not actually black and white , ' @entity45 said			0

excavation of @entity65 24 at @entity21 , @entity22 , that revealed the oldest monumental construction in the @entity17 lowlands			1
it shows the development of the culture was more cosmopolitan than previously thought in their excavations at @entity21 , an ancient @entity17 site in @entity22 , researchers found that @entity21 actually predates the growth of @entity41 as a major center by as much as 200 years , suggesting that @entity41 could not have been the prevailing influence over early @entity17 development			1
that does not make the @entity17 civilization older than the @entity39 civilization – since @entity39 had another center prior to @entity41 – nor does it prove that the @entity17 civilization developed entirely independently , researchers say			0
what it does indicate , they say , is that both @entity21 and @entity41 probably participated in a broader cultural shift taking place in the period between 1,150 - 800 b.c. ' basically , there was a major social change happening from the southern @entity90 to possibly the coast of @entity92 and the southern @entity93 , and this site of @entity21 was a part of that broader social change , ' @entity87 said			1
' the emergence of a new form of society – with new architecture , with new rituals – became really the important basis for all later @entity104 civilizations			0
' the science paper , titled ' @entity106 at @entity21 , @entity22 , and the @entity107 , ' is based on seven years of excavations at @entity21			1

experts now believe @entity17 culture evolved from mixing with other early south @entity13 cultures			2

early @entity17 civilisation found to be far more complex than previously thought
formal plazas and pyramids at @entity21 in @entity22 arose from broad cultural exchanges
