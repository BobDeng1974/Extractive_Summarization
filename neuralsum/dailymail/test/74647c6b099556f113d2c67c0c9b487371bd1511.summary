a device has been created that can scan entire planes for contraband , bombs and weapons			1
the mobile x-ray scanner , heralded as the world ’s first ‘ airplane scanner ’ , sweeps down a plane and can detect various objects inside			2
while the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated , the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety			1
it uses a cone of radiation to sweep across planes ( shown ) and look inside			1
the device is accurate enough to find a filament in a light bulb			1
but the radiation it emits is not safe for passengers yet the @entity21 is being developed by @entity20 company @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
it costs € 3 million ( £ 2.1 million , $ 3.2 million ) , reported @entity31 , and is apparently already being used to check trucks at borders in @entity34 , where it has helped seize 76,000 packs of illegal cigarettes			0
on its website , @entity19 says the @entity21 is ‘ the very first solution for aircraft security inspection			1
’ it can scan planes from small private jets to medium - sized commercial airplanes			2
the company notes that , while passengers and their luggage are thoroughly inspected at airports , there is no such inspection process for jets arriving at small private airports with low security			1
but with their device , the company says this ‘ gap ’ in aviation security can be plugged , and it can scan an entire plane in about 20 minutes			1
the device can be used to detect weapons ( shown ) and other contraband in small or medium - sized jets that land at low - security airports an operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane , although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted there are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned			1
armed with a sharp sense of smell , dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers , and soon there could be sniffer elephants too			0
researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell , stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives			0
elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones			0
the research was conducted in @entity100 and involved the @entity102 military			0
the first is the operating truck , from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane			0
attached to this is a robotic arm with an x-ray generator at the end			0
the plane is then pulled forwards by a battery - operated tug over a wide detection module			0
by firing x-rays out of the arm , a cone of radiation sweeps over the plane			2
the operator inside the truck is then given live images of the interior of the plane , and is able to scan its entirety for hidden items			0
it is apparently so accurate that it could pick out keys on a seat or even a filament in a light bulb			1
one issue , though , is that aircraft operators do not authorities to inspect the whole plane - areas of the fuselage and the wings are off limits , even though @entity21 can examine these areas			2
‘ you can not touch it , but you can scan it , ’ said @entity137 of @entity19 at the @entity138 in @entity139 this week			2
there are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned			0
