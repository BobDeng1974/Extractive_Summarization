for some , this means enlisting extra support to give them peace of mind , and that ’s where @entity14 come into play			1
the @entity18 based company is @entity20 's highest profile investigation business to specialise in infidelity , and they 've been flooded with business in the @entity23			1
most people will see the clues and call it quits , but some need more closure ' @entity26 , the managing director of the company , told @entity36 the investigations are conducted across a number of fields			1
‘ we primarily deal with surveillance , but we also delve into database work and internet investigations			1
it varies from case to case , ’ he said			2
investigations typically begin with a phone call to the client , which sees the investigator ask two dozen questions to establish the plan of attack			1
‘ it ’s a certain type of person that will seek an investigator			2
most people will see the clues and call it quits , but some need more closure			2
it ’s can also come down to cultural differences			0
’ a unfaithful partner caught in the act by @entity14 , who claim to have an 80 per cent success rate @entity26 said harsh anti-surveillance laws in @entity20 hinder the equipment they can use on jobs , such as computer hacking and electronic tagging clients are charged a flat rate of $ 95 an hour , and while some jobs take a handful of hours , some can drag on much longer			1
‘ we had one client who spent half a million dollars over four years			0
we had plenty of evidence , but it was a drawn out case and it ended up becoming quite complicated			0
' @entity26 says the company also handles an array of other investigative work			1

we take on anything from council work to companies trying to catch out employees taking a sickie			0
’ @entity26 said harsh anti-surveillance laws in @entity20 hinder the equipment they can use on jobs			1
‘ we ’re pretty hard up			0
we ca n’t do electronic tracking , ca n’t hack into accounts			0
the office incident in @entity96 would be an ideal result for us , because that ’s working within the parameters of the law			0
’ he said most of his results come from conventional surveillance , which includes the use of forensic tools , hidden cameras and night - vision equipment			1
they also arrange honey - trapping job , where a decoy is sent into partners favourite watering hole or gym to flirt with them and see what happens next , to catch out infidelity before it has even happened			2

@entity26 ( pictured ) said he takes on anything from council work to companies trying to catch out employees taking a sickie ‘ social media has really transformed the industry			0
there is a drop in business because people can do the process themselves , chasing the leads of their partner on @entity135 and such			2

so we can more clients from that			0
i think the overall workload is the same , it ’s just a different dynamic			0
’ @entity26 says the work is consistent throughout the year , with a surge in business on certain obvious dates such as @entity150			2
‘ you can never put your finger on busy times			0
we just had the busiest january since we started our business , but i could n’t tell you why			2

we ca n’t be ten blocks behind the suspect			0
’ he said investigations have about an 80 per cent success rate , but that ‘ it would be a 90 per cent if clients had more money			1
generally , if you have suspicions they are probably warranted			0
