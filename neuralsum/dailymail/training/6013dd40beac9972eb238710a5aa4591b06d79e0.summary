a @entity1 jury has slammed the nation 's no. 2 cigarette maker , @entity2 , with $ 23.6 billion in punitive damages in a lawsuit filed by the widow of a longtime smoker who died of lung cancer in 1996			1
the case is one of thousands filed in @entity1 after the state @entity11 in 2006 tossed out a $ 145 billion class action verdict			1
that ruling also said smokers and their families need only prove addiction and that smoking caused their illnesses or deaths			0
last year , @entity1 's highest court re-approved that decision , which made it easier for sick smokers or their survivors to pursue lawsuits against tobacco companies without having to prove to the court again that @entity29 knowingly sold dangerous products and hid the hazards of cigarette smoking			2
@entity48 individually sued @entity2 in 2008 on behalf of her late husband , @entity47 sr. her attorneys said the punitive damages are the largest of any individual case stemming from the original class action lawsuit			1
' the jury wanted to send a statement that tobacco can not continue to lie to the @entity58 people and the @entity58 government about the addictiveness of and the deadly chemicals in their cigarettes , ' said one of the woman 's attorneys , @entity63			0
@entity2 ' vice president and assistant general counsel , @entity68 , called the damages in @entity48 's case ' grossly excessive and impermissible under state and constitutional law			1
' ' this verdict goes far beyond the realm of reasonableness and fairness , and is completely inconsistent with the evidence presented , ' @entity68 said in a statement			2
' we plan to file post-trial motions with the trial court promptly , and are confident that the court will follow the law and not allow this runaway verdict to stand			2
' the lawsuit 's goal was to stop tobacco companies from targeting children and young people with their advertising , said @entity91 , another attorney representing @entity48			2
addiction : a 2006 ruling determined that smokers and their families need only prove addiction and that smoking caused their illnesses or deaths ' if we do n't get a dime , that 's ok , if we can make a difference and save some lives , ' @entity91 said			2
in june , the @entity58 @entity11 turned away cigarette manufacturers ' appeals of more than $ 70 million in court judgments to @entity1 smokers			1
@entity2 , @entity109 and @entity110 had wanted the court to review cases in which smokers won large damage awards without having to prove that the companies sold a defective and dangerous product or hid the risks of smoking			0
the @entity11 refused to hear another of the companies ' appeals last year , wanting the court to consider overturning a $ 2.5 million @entity124 jury verdict in the death of a smoker			1
other @entity1 juries have hit tobacco companies with tens of millions of dollars in punitive damages in lawsuits stemming from the original class action lawsuit			1
in august , a @entity133 jury awarded $ 37.5 million , including $ 22.5 million in punitive damages against @entity2 , to the family of a smoker who died at age 38 of lung cancer in 1995			1
attorneys for @entity2 said they would appeal , arguing that the woman knew the dangers of smoking because cigarettes had warning labels when she started			0
the attorney for the woman 's family said teenagers like her were targeted by tobacco companies			0
some large jury verdicts awarding tens of millions of dollars in damages to relatives of smokers have been upheld by appeals courts			0
@entity2 ' vice president and assistant general counsel , @entity68 , called the damages in @entity48 's case " grossly excessive and impermissible under state and constitutional law " in september , the 3rd @entity161 affirmed $ 25 million in punitive damages and $ 10 million in compensatory damages against @entity110 , the country 's no. 3 cigarette maker , for @entity165 , whose husband died in 1996 of lung cancer			1
@entity110 , based in @entity168 , @entity169 , unsuccessfully argued the damages were excessive and raised a number of other claims			0
the 1st @entity161 upheld in june 2013 a $ 20 million punitive damage award to another smoker 's widow , more than a year after reversing a $ 40.8 million award in the same case against @entity2			1
after the appeals court rejected the first award as excessive the award amount was recalculated			0
the tobacco company still objected			0
@entity109 is the country 's biggest tobacco company and owned by @entity186 , @entity183 - based @entity182 is owned by @entity187 , @entity169 - based @entity188			0

the case is one of thousands filed in @entity1 after the state @entity11 in 2006 tossed out a $ 145 billion class action verdict
the damages were awarded friday to @entity42 , whose husband died of lung cancer
@entity2 ' vice president and assistant general counsel , @entity68 , called the damages in @entity48 's case ' grossly excessive and impermissible under state and constitutional law '
