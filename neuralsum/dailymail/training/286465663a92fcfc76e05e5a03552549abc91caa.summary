by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 22:02 est , 19 october 2012 lawyers for the defence in the @entity4 trial are blaming @entity4 's breakup with @entity6 for the downward spiral that eventually saw her sectioned			1
a lawyer for @entity9 and @entity4 , who made opening statements for the defence earlier today , says the end of this relationship with her childhood sweetheart was so painful that she changed almost overnight , according to @entity14			1
according to the lawyer , before they split , @entity4 was a ' ray of light , ' but afterwards she became ' angered and depressed			2
' so happy : @entity4 ' break up with @entity6 ' caused the downward spiral ' that led to her being sectioned , her parents ' lawyers claim they also claimed that @entity21 would hide the singer 's dog , wait for the tears to come and then ' find ' the pup to appear as a ' saviour figure ' to the star			1
they added that @entity4 's parents , especially her father @entity29 , had made heroic efforts to help their daughter			1
lawyers also mentioned that when @entity29 tried to ask @entity21 to stay away from his daughter , the parent touched @entity21 's arm and is now being sued for assault			1
' and at that point @entity29 touched @entity21			1
for that , @entity29 is being sued for battery , ' lawyer @entity39 said			2
he said @entity21 was not hurt and was out that night with @entity4			1
spears attempted to put on a brave face as she faced on the world on thursday afternoon while her ex manager made a series of bombshell claims about her in court at the same time			0
the 30 - year - old looked tense and dishevelled as she stepped out in @entity51 with a male companion wearing grimy tracksuit pants and a white t - shirt			0
back in the fray : @entity4 parents , @entity57 and @entity58 arrive at court on friday her former manager @entity21 claimed she was once hooked on prescription drugs , downing up to 30 a day , and was in such a grip of addiction she shaved her head to beat a drugs test			1
@entity21 is suing @entity42 , her mother @entity57 and father @entity29 for defamation , breach of contract and libel			1
' she liked to use amphetamines			0
mostly everything that went wrong was because of this drug , ' @entity21 's lawyer @entity72 told the jury , alleging that mr @entity21 was made a scapegoat for the singer 's mental breakdown back in 2008			1
@entity72 told the jury that @entity4 had a ' prescription for amphetamines , and overdosed on them ' before being put in the involuntary 5150 hold			2
carrying on as normal : on thursday , while @entity21 gave evidence ... @entity4 shopped and worked out as normal gym visit : the @entity87 judge stopped in for a workout on thursday as she tried to carry on as normal @entity21 felt that @entity4 should not perform at the 2007 @entity89 as she was still overweight and did not rehearse			1
however ' @entity4 would n't hear it			2
' the star 's subsequent lacklustre performance at the ceremony was roundly criticised			0
@entity72 added that @entity21 was trying to help the singer but lost control in a series of events that led to her being hospitalised and placed under a court - ordered conservator			0
@entity21 is also seeking a share of the singer 's fortunes , claiming he had an agreement to serve as her manager in exchange for 15 percent of her earnings			2
@entity72 conceded the case would be a complicated one			0
his opening statements included flashing photos of @entity4 with a shaved head and striking an suv with an umbrella back in 2007 during a period of her life which he described as a ' complete shambles			0
' he said one of @entity21 's first actions after being hired as manager was having drug - sniffing dogs search the singer 's hilltop home			2
he claimed @entity4 favoured amphetamines and that the dogs turned up a substance the grammy - award winner told @entity21 was probably crystal meth			1
turned sour : @entity21 , pictured with @entity4 in 2008 , was once an integral part of the singer 's camp but is now suing his former client and her parents for defamation and breach of contract but jurors are unlikely to hear directly from the singer , who remains under a conservatorship overseen by a judge who has ordered her not to appear for trial or a deposition			1
superior court judge @entity147 told @entity72 during a break in proceedings that all the accusations he raised during his opening statement should be supported by evidence to be presented at trial			0
@entity72 said he would prove them through either ' testimony or documentary evidence			0
' attorneys for @entity4 ' parents and conservators will have their own opportunity to present opening remarks to jurors			2
@entity21 and @entity4 ' parents , @entity29 and @entity57 , were all in court as @entity72 made his opening statements to the panel of eight women and four men ; @entity4 's parents took notes throughout			1
@entity58 did not look up at the photos of his daughter that @entity72 displayed			0
lacklustre : @entity21 claims he did not want @entity4 taking part in the 2007 @entity89 awards but she ' would n't hear it ' @entity21 is seeking millions of dollars from @entity42 and her family , claiming her mother 's @entity57 's 2008 book : through the storm : a @entity181 in a @entity182 , lied about him drugging and isolating the pop superstar			1
he is also seeking a portion of the singer 's profits , claiming he was a key player in her 2007 album @entity187 and had the right to serve as her manager for years			0
the case is the culmination of years of acrimony between @entity21 and @entity4 ' family and conservators , who successfully obtained a restraining order against him to keep him from contacting the singer or trying to intervene in her life			1
the order has expired , but conservatorship attorneys are seeking repayment for more than $ 93,000 in legal fees - a judgement @entity21 is appealing			0
shaved head : @entity72 told the jury @entity4 had shaved her head to avoid a drugs test on her follicles @entity21 sued back in february 2009 , roughly a year after @entity4 was hospitalised and placed under the conservatorship to take control of her health and finances			1
the move by @entity58 came after months of erratic behaviour by his daughter , including shaving her head , speaking in a @entity218 accent and other bizarre incidents that also led to her losing custody of her two sons with ex-husband @entity222			0
@entity21 was a constant presence around @entity4 during this tumultuous period of her life , her parents accused of him of crushing tablets into her food			1
it 's also been claimed that @entity4 was going broke during her time with @entity231			2
with no source of income , the star - who was worth $ 32 million - was spending $ 700 a month , paying huge legal bills in her custody case with @entity237 and renting luxury mansions , one of which she spent just three nights in			0
in his court case he maintains that he was trying to help her , though her parents say @entity21 cut her phone line , hid her cellphones and used the paparazzi as ' henchmen			2
' he also said that @entity4 shaved her hair to avoid the courts finding drug residue - which can remain in the strands for months after use			0
turned life around : @entity4 now has a role as a @entity256 x factor judge and plans to wed agent @entity257 @entity72 claimed @entity21 befriended the paparazzi so that they would treat @entity42 with more respect and claims he tried to assemble top talent agents to jumpstart her career			1
' @entity21 was trying to find top notch people to work with @entity4 , ' he told the court			1
@entity231 is also planning to call @entity265 to testify that @entity4 is being controlled by her parents via the conservatorship			2
' @entity267 ended up quitting her job because she was so disturbed by what she saw was happening to @entity4 … @entity267 ’s testimony could have significant impact on the jury because she spent a great deal of time with @entity4 and her parents after the conservatorship was put in place			2
@entity267 is n’t after money , she just wants the truth to come out and it will be shocking , ' a source told @entity280			0
many of the claims about @entity231 were included in court filings used to obtain the conservatorship , but @entity9 also included them in her book			0
@entity21 is suing for libel based on three chapters in the book that describe him as a ' general ' to the paparazzi and portray him as a man trying to manipulate not only the singer , but also her mother			0
although she is still under conservatorship , @entity4 is now firmly back on track with a role as a judge on @entity297			0
she is also now preparing to marry long - term love @entity257			0
the case continues today .			0
