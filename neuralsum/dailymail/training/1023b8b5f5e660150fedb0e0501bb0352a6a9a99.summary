@entity0 is an impeccably spoken septuagenarian who has produced three daughters : a judge , an opera singer and a legal adviser			1
so , she ’s the most unlikely person you can imagine to have a conversation with you about wearing a bikini under her coat , accosting young men in the park or what it feels like to walk into a waxing salon and ask for a vajazzle — that intimate body decoration so beloved of the girls in @entity17			1
indeed , she ’s rather stunned that she ’s au fait with such topics herself , but then lets out a mischievous laugh			1
naughty : @entity24 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) are the stars of off their rockers , an @entity27 hidden camera show where the pranksters are all old enough , frankly , to know better ‘ it is rather fun , is n’t it ? it is n’t good for life to be too predictable			1
’ @entity0 is one of the irrepressible stars of off their rockers , an @entity27 hidden camera show where the pranksters are all old enough , frankly , to know better			1
the programme typically involves seemingly sweet little old ladies or dapper grandads needing help — sometimes with a mobile phone , often with directions — in the street			1
they usually pick young people , often teenagers , to ask for assistance			1
then something untoward — embarrassing , rude or downright baffling — happens			1
so , we have the fusty old dear asking a complete stranger to help her read a text message from her doctor — informing her that she is pregnant with twins			1
or the shuffling pensioner who asks the girl beside her at the bus stop for some assistance — with scattering her dead husband ’s ashes while they wait for the bus			1
prank : we have the fusty old dear asking a complete stranger to help her read a text message from her doctor - informing her that she is pregnant with twins ‘ would you like to say anything , dear ? ’ she asks , while the poor young woman looks on , speechless			1
this was one of @entity0 ’s performances			1
one recurring sketch involves one of the pranksters approaching someone and asking them to pull their finger			1
when they do , the elderly lady breaks wind , says ‘ that ’s better , ’ and walks off — invariably leaving their ‘ helper ’ incredulous , and often doubled over with laughter			1
another requires two lady pranksters , who approach an unsuspecting soul saying that they are having a disagreement and could they have help in resolving it			1
their question ? ‘ which one of us has the better bikini body ? ’ @entity0 ’s cv might groan with highbrow theatrical jobs — she has been an actress since she was eight years old — but this particular job was quite a departure , though she does point out that she was once in a @entity96 music video			1
‘ it was i predict a riot			1
it was a @entity99 street scene and i was dancing around			2
i ca n’t quite recall why now			2
but it was great fun			2
i ’d do it again			2
’ all the hoaxers are actors , and good ones , too , given how pretty much everyone falls for their sob stories			2
‘ it was quite embarrassing to do some of the pranks , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ because with real acting the person you are talking to is usually acting , too			2
‘ with this job , there was quite a lot of improvisation going on			2
and we never knew whether the person we approached was going to laugh , hit us or call the police			2
’ in one encounter , an elderly nun runs amok on her mobility scooter , wreaking havoc all round			1
comedy : the programme typically involves seemingly sweet little old ladies or dapper grandads needing help - sometimes with a mobile phone , often with directions - in the street hidden camera shows were introduced to the @entity130 by @entity131 , a presenter and journalist who adapted a hit @entity134 show called @entity136 for audiences here , and became its chief prankster			1
it ran for seven years in the 1960s and was revived twice in the 70s			2
the show made routh a cult figure			1
even though he died in 2008 , aged 80 , some of his most enduring japes are attracting new audiences on @entity149			2
the best include a talking postbox , edible goldfish and a flower on a restaurant table that takes sly sips of diners ’ drinks			2
it did n’t always go well for @entity131			2
once , his target for a joke turned out to be a former heavyweight boxer — who gave him a black eye			2
another time , preparing for a stunt near a bank , a passer - by thought @entity131 was acting suspiciously and dialled 999 to report a possible robbery in progress			2
but the viewers loved it			2
at the peak of his fame @entity131 received 1,000 letters a week from members of the public suggesting new hoaxes to try out			0
actually , though , @entity0 says , there was generally very little trouble and if anything , people were only too anxious to help			1
‘ i had one that involved the film crew putting my car in a skip in the @entity186 , and i had to ask people to help me get it out			0
‘ i had an awful time trying to stop one man from calling the police			0
‘ another time , i did have to be rescued by the camera crew			1
‘ i had proposed to a young man and , well , i think he took it a little bit too seriously			0
’ @entity24 — 78 years young , and currently starring in a play about the @entity196 , ‘ which is rather more serious ’ — admits she was a little sceptical when she heard that her agent had put her up for the job of being an off their rockers prankster			1
she speaks with an even grander voice than @entity0 , and says : ‘ one generally does n’t approach complete strangers in the street			1
i am not a street entertainer			0
i actually lost 7lb during filming			0
’ still , she sounds like quite a convert			0
her favourite jape involved her sitting on a park bench in @entity210 and asking the occupant where the nearest tube station was			0
learning curve : the programme may fall into the throwaway comedy category , but the actors say they were surprised at what they have learned about the younger generation when he said ‘ @entity225 ’ , she had to say : ‘ i am so sorry , dear , i am a little hard of hearing , can you repeat that , slower ? ’ the poor man did this 43 times before , to her astonishment , offering to take her there			0
‘ this was a chap i would have been afraid to speak to in real life			0
he had dreadlocks , tattoos and everything			0
‘ but he was so kind and helpful			0
by the end i loved him			0
i could have eaten him up ! ‘ he got up and offered to walk me there , so i went with him and i just kept talking			0
i forgot all about supposedly being deaf			0
‘ i got away down the road before i remembered that the cameras were still going and i really better get back			0
’ @entity24 was constantly amazed at how kind , helpful and respectful members of the public were			1
‘ not one person said “ silly old bat ” , which i ’m sure i would have done in their position			0
’ star of the show , though , must be 76 - year - old @entity249 , who has the sort of face that screams character actor			1
he ’s worked up and down the country in repertory theatre , spending some time running venues , and is a veteran of 70 tv commercials			0
' i 'm just glad to be working at my age , and i hope to be doing so for many years to come ' @entity249 in his time he has flogged everything from spectacles ( he ’s in the current @entity263 ad ) to nappies and ragu sauce			0
like @entity0 , he ’s also a music video veteran , having starred alongside @entity267			1
@entity249 — who had a triple bypass a few years back brought on by ‘ too many chocolate buttons ’ during a stint in panto — says that it may seem like an unusual career choice , but ‘ who cares ? ’ ‘ it ’s just fun , is n’t it ? ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ve been having a ball , getting out , meeting interesting people , making them laugh — eventually			0
his favourite prank ? ‘ there is one when i am jogging past a pub and there are people sitting enjoying the sunshine outside , and i grab one of their pints on the way past and pour it over my head , ’ he says			0
‘ my biggest surprise is that i have n’t been punched			0
’ he says the pranks involving mobile phones do n’t take an awful lot of acting			0
‘ because i ca n’t use them ! they gave me an @entity297 and i did n’t really know what to do with it			0
every time i have to show someone something on the screen , it goes blank and i do n’t know how to get it back			1
’ some of the sketches can be a bit risqué , though			0
is there anything he found too rude ? ‘ well , there was one sketch that involved me going into a shop and asking to photocopy something , er , unusual			1
‘ i objected to a word they used			0
i said : “ i ca n’t say that if children are watching			0
” so they changed it			0
’ the programme may fall into the throwaway comedy category , but all three actors say they were surprised at what they have learned about the younger generation			0
‘ all of the youngsters we have met have just been so sweet , ’ says @entity24			1
‘ it really does restore your faith in humanity			0
i certainly did n’t expect that			0
