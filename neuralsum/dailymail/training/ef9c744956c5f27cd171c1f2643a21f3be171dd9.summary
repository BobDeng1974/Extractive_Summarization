by @entity0 published : 07:02 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 19:24 est , 18 october 2012 an 11 - year - old boy has been banned from joining the @entity2 because he does not believe in @entity3 and refuses to swear allegiance			1
@entity5 had attended his local scout group for ten months before scoutmasters invited him to invest in the group			1
but the schoolboy , from @entity10 , @entity11 , refused to make the @entity12 which includes doing one ’s ‘ duty to @entity3 and to the @entity14 ’			1
the movement is unashamed of its religious roots and allows children of other faiths to pledge allegiance the @entity2 centre in @entity10 where @entity5 had been going for ten months before he was asked to invest in the scouts although variations in wording are permitted for members of non-christian religions , there is no exception made for atheists			1
as a result he can not join because children of all faiths must make the promise to @entity3 if they want to become part of the organisation			1
yesterday the @entity38 refused to back down			0
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity40 has been an important tenet of the movement for 105 years			0
’ ' all young people are required to make the @entity12 if they wish to become a @entity12			1
' @entity44 are available for different faiths ( such as the use of ' @entity47 ' to replace ' @entity3 ' for @entity2 ) , however all the variations of the promise recognise the ' duty to @entity3 ' element			1
' young people are required to show both an understanding , relevant to their age , and an acceptance of the promise before they become a member			0
' young people will not be refused membership solely because of their parents ’ beliefs or non-beliefs , however they are required to make the promise as outlined above			0
' furthermore , @entity64 accepts that as they grow into independent adults , some young people may question or doubt the existence of @entity3 as they develop their personal spiritual understanding			2
' scouting believes that young people going through this process should be able to remain a @entity12			2
' @entity5 says he is ' disappointed ' and was look forward to going caving with the group however , his father @entity73 , 45 , is furious about the decision and has accused the @entity76 movement of being ‘ intolerant ’			1
he said : ' @entity76 is meant to be about being tolerant , forgiving and understanding			0
' you are allowed to join if you are a @entity76 or a muslim but you ca n’t not believe in @entity3			1
he ’s being excluded because he does n’t believe			0
' i ’ve brought @entity5 up to be courteous , kind and considerate			2
' he ’s a clever child and came to the decision himself , he does n’t believe in @entity3 and does n’t believe the world was was formed in seven days			2
' this is @entity5 's choice and if he changes his mind in six months ’ time then that is fine by me , as long as he has made an informed choice			1
' refusal : children of all faiths can join the scouts			2
@entity79 children , for example , can swear duty to @entity47 @entity5 began attending the 1st @entity94 in @entity11 - which meets in a hall opposite his house - in january			1
but to become a full member he must now take the @entity12 , which reads : ' on my honour , i promise that i will do my best , to do my duty to @entity3 and to the @entity14 , to help other people , and to keep the @entity102			1
' @entity5 is sad that he can not join but will not say the words required by all scouts who wish to become a part of the movement scouting was founded by lord @entity108 of @entity109 ( 1857 - 1941 ) , a decorated soldier , talented artist , actor and free - thinker			1
his experiences during the @entity113 propelled him to develop a training programme for young people in @entity116			0
in 1907 , encouraged by his friends , he held an experimental camp on @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , to try out his ideas			0
he brought together 20 boys , some from public schools and some from working class homes , and put them into camp under his leadership			0
@entity129 was published in 1908 and sales of the book were enormous			0
what had been intended as a training aid for existing organisations became the handbook of a new and , ultimately , worldwide movement			0
@entity129 has since been translated into many different languages and dialects			0
there are now around 28million scouts worldwide @entity5 called the decision ' very unfair ' and says he is missing out on the adventures scouts enjoy because of his atheism			2
he said : ' i am really disappointed about not being able to go anymore just because i do n’t believe in @entity3			2
' we have spoken about it with the @entity149 but he wo n’t change his decision , it is very unfair			0
' my friends who are @entity2 do n’t think it is right , either			2
' everyone is going caving soon and i ’ve never been before			0
it is something i would love to do but i ’m not allowed			0
' i ’m not going to change my decision though			0
' the @entity64 was founded by @entity108 in 1907 and adventurer @entity156 is the @entity116 ’s current chief scout			0
the ‘ @entity160 ’ star , famed for his death - defying challenges , has spoken strongly about his @entity76 in the past			0
mr @entity5 , who lives with wife @entity162 , 40 and 14 - year - old son @entity163 , is surprised that the scouting movement is not willing to accept @entity5			1
he said : ' to be invested into the @entity2 you have to believe in a @entity3 but it does not say which religion that @entity3 is from			1
' so you can be @entity79 or @entity167 , but if you have the courage to stand up and admit that you do not believe in any @entity3 then look out because you are not welcome into the @entity12 community			1
' @entity5 had the guts to stand up and admit his view and i believe the @entity2 are being narrow - minded			1

@entity5 , 11 , can not join the @entity2 because he *objected* to a *reference* to @entity3 in the *traditional* @entity12
the organisation says it welcomes all faiths but the ' duty to @entity3 ' part of the promise is a *fundamental* part of its ethos
@entity5 's father brands the century - old movement ' intolerant '
