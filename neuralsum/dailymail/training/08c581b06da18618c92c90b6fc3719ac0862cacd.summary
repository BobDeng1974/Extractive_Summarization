by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is hoping a good season with @entity4 in the @entity5 could earn him an @entity7 call - up			1
the former @entity9 full - back is regarded as one of the @entity4 ' best players and has been included in the @entity13 team of the season for the last two years			1
@entity2 has played for @entity7 at every level from under - 18s to under - 21s and is hoping to impress manager @entity18			1
he said : ' it 's always been my ambition to play for @entity7			0
i 've played at a young age and it was an honour , i loved every minute of it			0
' i 'm playing in the @entity5 now and i just want to do very well			2
i 'm only 23 so i 'm certainly not going to write it off			0
hopefully i can catch the manager 's eye and show what i can do , and hopefully i can get the nod			0
' impressive : @entity2 has made the @entity13 team of the season two years running @entity2 was rumoured to be interesting @entity31 at the end of last season but he committed himself to @entity4 by signing a three - year contract until 2017			1
and the 23 - year - old insisted leaving @entity36 was never a consideration			2
' it 's been a good two seasons for me and all the lads , ' he said			2
' i 'm just delighted that i did well in the @entity13 and i 'll try to take it one step further			2
' when the season finished i was speaking to the gaffer and i committed myself to the club			2
i never had any intention of leaving			0
' before the season ended i 'd spoken to the gaffer and i was glad to finally get it signed early doors so i could just enjoy my summer and look forward to coming back			1
' it 's always been my dream to play in the @entity5 and i 'm just happy i 'm doing it with @entity4			1
' international : the 23 - year - old admitted competition was tough but ' would n't rule out ' an @entity7 call - up the first matches @entity2 looked for when the fixture list came out were @entity4 's two clashes with @entity9 , the first of which is a trip to the @entity63 on december 28			1
the defender spent all of his youth career with the club but , despite captaining the @entity69 - winning side in 2008 , he never made a first - team appearance			1
after two loan spells at @entity72 , he headed to @entity4 on loan in july 2011 and signed a permanent deal the following january			1
' it was a tough time because i was there from about eight , ' he said of his @entity9 departure			0
' when i came on loan to @entity4 i still had about three years left at @entity9 but it was a choice that i made because i wanted to play games and i did n't want to be playing for the reserves any more			1
' i 've got a few people i still speak to there			0
i 'll always try to keep in contact with them because they brought me through the ranks but there 'll be no friends when i go back there			2
success : few people thought @entity93 and @entity4 would win promotion after selling @entity95 ' i do n't think i have anything to prove to them , all i want to do is put the @entity4 shirt on , go out there and do the best for me and the club			2
' @entity4 begin their second season of @entity5 football with a home match against @entity105 a week on monday			1
their first campaign ended in relegation in 2010 and they are odds - on to suffer the same fate again			0
but @entity2 is taking inspiration from @entity111 following their incredible revival under @entity114 last season as well as the manner in which @entity4 defied expectations to reach the @entity5			1
' last season we were fourth favourites to get relegated and we got automatic promotion , ' he said			0
' this season obviously we 're going to be written off but , if you look at @entity111 last season , they were written off by @entity123 and they finished 11th			0
' we 're used to being written off but we 've just got to get on with it and play to the best of our ability			0
we proved everyone wrong last season so who says we ca n't do that this season			0
