a morbidly obese 13 - year - old girl who weighed more than 200lbs has managed to lose more than a third of her body weight after undergoing gastric surgery in march			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , suffered from a rare condition called hypothalamic obesity , a disease which leaves sufferers feeling constantly hungry and saw the teenager put on more than 150lbs over a two year period			1
but after undergoing a complex surgical procedure to reduce the size of her stomach , she is now happily on the road to recovery - and is , according to her mother , looking and feeling healthy for the first time in years			1
@entity20 and happy : @entity4 has lost almost 60 pounds since undergoing gastric surgery in march on the road to recovery : while her mother @entity23 admits that the family still have a long road ahead , @entity4 is back at school and is even taking part in sporting activities dangerously ill : @entity4 , pictured here in january , put on more than 150lbs in two years after being diagnosed with hypothalamic obesity in 2011 ' we began 2014 in the darkest , lowest place , ' @entity31 told the today show			1
' but as the months rolled by , we slowly climbed up the mountain			0
today , we get to see the pretty view			0
my daughter , @entity4 , is healthy			1
we have not been able to say that for a long time			2
' @entity4 ' condition was first brought to light in 2011 , after her insurance company denied her parents ' request to allow her to undergo a gastric bypass - which they believed would help her to fight her condition and , ultimately , save her life			1
desperate to ensure that their daughter receive the necessary medical treatment , @entity4 ' parents began an online campaign to raise the money that would pay for the surgery			1
the campaign proved to be an incredible success - and saw donations pouring in from generous supporters around the world , eventually raising more than $ 80,000			2
and now , eight months after undergoing the gastric sleeve procedure , @entity4 is back at school and working towards a full recovery - and is even able to take part in organised sports and physical activities , something which two years ago seemed an impossibility			1

' she still does n't like going to school and gives me a hard time sometimes but she tries her best			0
' she gets very very tired from school			0

thank you everyone for caring ! ' but @entity23 makes clear that her daughter still has a long way to go , writing in a piece for the today show : ' this is not the spot where we ’ll finish our journey			2
' but from here , we can see life so much better			0

today , we see her future			0
