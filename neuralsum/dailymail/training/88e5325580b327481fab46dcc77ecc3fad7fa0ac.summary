by @entity1 reporter an excitable @entity2 shared the secrets of his intimate grooming regime with a morning tv show - and the rest of the country - today			1
' i do get my bum waxed			0
i do , ' the tanned 27 - year - old exclaimed at the beginning of a 10 - minute hair removal ' tried and tested ' section during this morning			1
an excitable @entity2 , 27 , shared the secrets of his intimate grooming regime with this morning - and the rest of the country - today , before waxing a volunteer ' a friend comes round to do it for me , ' he confided to a surprised @entity18 and @entity19			1
' it 's a bit too awkward to go to a salon , because you 're there getting your bum waxed and someone will say " so what 's going on in the series ? " '			2
@entity2 and @entity18 press on the waxing strips while @entity19 looks on @entity2 and @entity31 rip off the wax strips from unfortunate volunteer @entity33 on today 's @entity34 as a horrified @entity35 looks on the hairy volunteer winces as the strips are pulled off his rather hirsute chest wax on , wax off : @entity18 and @entity19 feel his pain after the waxing , comes ' sugaring ' where a sticky , sweet substance is smeared on , then ripped off with a strip to remove hair ' @entity46 is important whether you 're a guy or a girl , ' continued the immaculately - groomed @entity50 runner - up and made in @entity52 star			1
however , in spite of his fondness for manscaping , @entity2 did not try out the various recommended hair removal methods , instead testing them out on volunteers			1
@entity2 put a variety of hair removal methods through their paces , ranging from the £ 449 @entity64 at - home laser treatment to live - and extremely painful - looking chest waxing and failed ' sugaring '			1
@entity67 , £ 449 an at - home device which will remove hair permanently , with minimal pain and fuss			1
no no ! hair , £ 193.50 you can use it on the bikini line , sensitive areas such as the face			0
there is a slight burning smell , however that just shows it is working on removing the hair @entity83 , £ 89.99 removes hair but also apparently has massaging , tightening effect			0
uses 40 tweezers to pluck out hairs from root			0
not a permanent method of removal , although hair does grow back more sparsely after repeated use			0
@entity93 wax strips , £ 10.99 removes hair efficiently but painfully , as shown on our clip			2
@entity97 sugaring starter kit , £ 25.95 works in a similar way to waxing , but all - natural and made only of sugar			1
however , the sticky substance got stuck on the tester 's chest hair , so did n't actually get rid of any fur			0
@entity107 's for men hair removal cream , £ 8.99 gets rid of hair without pain , but re-growth very quick as not plucked from follicle			0
could a new career in the beauty and grooming industry be on the cards ? @entity2 recently came third in @entity50 behind former @entity117 singer @entity116 and winner @entity118 , so his popularity with the public is in no doubt			2
fans were hoping that he and @entity124 star @entity123 would start an on - set romance , but it was not to be			0
@entity123 first claimed to fancy @entity2 during a task set by @entity50 earlier in the series but the pair 's friendship seemed to grow stronger as time moved on			2
and , in the penultimate episode of the season on tuesday night , @entity2 attempted to tell @entity123 he was attracted to her but felt he could n't express his true feelings in front of the cameras			2
however , things fizzled once the pair were out of the house and there are rumours that @entity123 and her ex @entity143 are once more an item .			0
