by @entity0 @entity1 is setting up a crack team of hackers to protect internet users from government snooping and cyber attacks			1
the firm says its ' project zero ' will look at everything from accidental flaws in code , known as zero day bugs , to major government operations			1
it also aims to make @entity1 's own service more secure , and make encryption easier for people to use			1
@entity1 's ' project zero ' will look at everything from accidental flaws in code to major government operations , and the search giant said users ' should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state - sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer , steal secrets or monitor your communications			1
' ' every bug we discover will be filed in an external database			2
' we will only report bugs to the software 's vendor — and no third parties			2
' once the bug report becomes public ( typically once a patch is available ) , you 'll be able to monitor vendor time - to - fix performance , see any discussion about exploitability , and view historical exploits and crash traces			0
' we also commit to sending bug reports to vendors in as close to real - time as possible , and to working with them to get fixes to users in a reasonable time			0
' source : @entity1 ' you should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state - sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer , steal secrets or monitor your communications , ' @entity1 's @entity54 , who is leading the project , said			1
' security is a top priority for @entity1			1
' we 've invested a lot in making our products secure , including strong @entity70 encryption by default for @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , as well as encrypting data moving between our data centers			1
' beyond securing our own products , interested @entity77 also spend some of their time on research that makes the @entity81 safer , leading to the discovery of bugs like @entity84			0
' the success of that part - time research led the firm to set up @entity88			0
' in sophisticated attacks , we see the use of ' zero - day ' vulnerabilities to target , for example , human rights activists or to conduct industrial espionage			0
' so - called ' zero - day ; exploits take advantage of unpatched flaws that programmers have not had time to fix			2
there is a thriving black market for the exploits , which can often be sold for thousands of dollars			0
@entity1 says it is already hiring hackers for the project , and urged more to get in touch			1
' this needs to stop			0
we think more can be done to tackle this problem			0
' we 're hiring the best practically - minded security researchers and contributing 100 % of their time toward improving security across the @entity81			0
speaking to @entity111 , @entity54 said the project would also target malware downloaded via website			0
' people deserve to use the internet without fear that vulnerabilities out there can ruin their privacy with a single website visit , ' we ’re going to try to focus on the supply of these high value vulnerabilities and eliminate them			2
' recently , the @entity124 was accused of keeping details about the colossal @entity84 bug hidden before it was eventually caught in part by @entity1 ’s researchers and patched .			1
