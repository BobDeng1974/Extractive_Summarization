this is the dramatic moment tourists on a safari stood their ground against a charging @entity4			0
rather than flee , these hikers at @entity6 in @entity7 put aside their fears and faced down the raging mammal after they stumbled upon the creature in the bush			1
and the onlookers kept their cool while one of the tourists captured the moment on a video camera when the beast squared - up to the group			1
a tour guide gets ready to aim his weapon at the beast as it took a run at the group with the tourists looking on the elephant then let out a roar while a guide aimed a rifle at its head to presumably keep the holidaymaker group from running away into the wild			1
after , the @entity4 - which can weigh up to 5.5 tons - turned away in the stand - off over a number of seconds , and the amateur filmmaker can be heard whispering : ' everyone 's able to breathe now			2
' @entity40 , the group 's walking safari guide , in a supposed respect for the raging mammal , said to the tour group : ' we do n't hunt elephants â€“ he came to us			1
' after the animal squared - off and beat back into the bush , the tourists can be later seen smiling and breathing a sigh of relief at the frightening moment which put them in a head - to - head with the beast			1
luckily for all involved they walked away with their lives and have the terrifying moment on film to look back on in the years ahead			0
now the safari leader points and aims his rifle as the raging mammal roars as it gets closer to the vacationers earlier , the onlookers in the park had been watching the @entity65 from a safe distance in the bush and unlike most tourists who come away from safaris with only snaps from wild animals at a distance , this group have a video to show their family and friends that show they got ' the real ' experience			1
but @entity80 tourists last year at @entity6 had a more violent stand - off with an elephant			1
the rampaging mammal reacted with fury to a car the group was travelling in			2
the wild beast stormed on to the dust track the holidaymakers were driving on and charged straight at their vehicle			0
here the tour groups laughs and smiles and enjoy looking at each other 's photos from the hair - raising moment video footage captured the moment the five - tonne bull elephant smashed its way in to the car using only one of its dagger - sharp tusks			0
wildlife watchers inside the vehicle yelled ' drive , drive , drive ! ' and fled the elephant , which had just fought off a rival at @entity6 in @entity7			2
a young boy among the tourists smiles as the coast is clear and the wild beast has headed back to the bush one of the @entity80 quipped as they sped away : ' i think we lost the deposit			0
' nobody was injured in the incident , despite broken glass showering the interior of the vehicle			0
bull elephants have tusks up to 5ft long which are often used for goring rivals in battles for supremacy of @entity7 's vast plains and savannahs			0
male elephants grow up to 13ft in height and often over females .			0
