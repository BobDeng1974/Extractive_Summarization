the @entity11 , written by a @entity13 journalist and released on tuesday , also claims the @entity14 was ‘ alone , frightened and unsure of what to do next ’ after moving to @entity15 the book claims to lift the lid on the struggles the family faced following @entity2 's successful presidential bid , after which they were watched by everyone – not least the @entity24			1
new start : the @entity11 celebrate a successful presidential bid in november 2008			0
after the win , @entity2 allegedly considered staying in @entity7 with daughters @entity29 ( centre right ) and @entity11 ( centre left ) following the campaign , @entity2 was thinking about putting off the move to the @entity9 , author @entity32 claims			1
@entity32 , who began reporting on the @entity11 in 2007 , writes : ‘ only a handful of friends and aides knew what @entity2 was considering : staying behind in @entity7 with her daughters for the rest of the school year while the new president moved to @entity15 alone			1
’ the @entity14 planned to commute between the two cities for a year , using the time to consider schools for the couple ’s daughters , @entity11 and @entity29			2
‘ she was anxious about relocating her children to a new city in the middle of the school year , ’ @entity32 writes			2
but her husband hated the idea , insisting he finally spend time with his family after years campaigning on the road			2
challenges : mrs @entity2 felt subdued and alone during her first few months in the @entity9 , the book claims protective : she also worried about how her girls , pictured in 2008 , would fare growing up in the @entity9 only when mrs @entity2 visited the @entity9 and was given a tour by her predecessor @entity62 did she warm to the idea , according to the book			1
but even then , she worried how her daughters would cope , believing ‘ a presidential race was potentially a curse upon her children ’ , @entity32 writes			1
she feared @entity9 tourists interrupting their play dates – and worried if she could trust other parents to look after the girls			0
a few months into life at the @entity9 , mrs @entity2 ‘ seemed spirited , enthusiastic , and active ’ , the book writes			1
‘ the truth , however was that the first lady was having an unhappy , difficult time in her new role			1
’ fighter : the first lady persevered and now loves her role , realizing the impact it can have , the book says she was deeply frustrated with elements of her new life , including the fact that she could no longer take her daughters to school functions without fear of causing a commotion			1
she also struggled living away from @entity7 and lost touch with friends			0
former @entity9 press secretary @entity95 has apologised for insulting @entity2 during an explosive staff meeting recounted in @entity32 's book , the @entity11			1
the argument erupted during a staff meeting in 2010 , after @entity95 had dealt with a report that mrs @entity2 had told @entity102 first lady @entity101 that she ' ca n't stand ' life in the @entity9 , that it was ' hell '			1
in a private meeting , senior advisor @entity105 said mrs. @entity2 was ' dissatisfied ' with how he handled the situation and @entity95 shouted at @entity109 for getting involved			2
he reportedly swore , including once directed at mrs. @entity2			2
on monday , @entity95 said : ' in any high - pressure work environment there are occasional arguments and disagreements and that is certainly true of the @entity9			0
i regret speaking in anger and regret that this disagreement became so public			0
' the @entity120 - educated lawyer also felt the role she perceived herself filling in the @entity9 never materialised , and felt ignored by her husband ’s advisers			2
' she was stuck in a position with little definition and no clear goals , ’ the book writes			0
she went on to acknowledge how tough life at @entity129 can be			0
‘ sometimes it becomes difficult to live in what we call a bubble , ’ she said , according to the book			2
but her outlook changed when , in april 2009 , she visited @entity136 and spoke at a girls ’ school – telling them that the world needed strong , female leaders			0
‘ we are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be , ’ she had said			0
watched by a sea of admiring girls , she understood for the first time what it meant to be first lady			2
‘ she saw the responsibility , the impact , the potential of her role , ’ @entity32 writes			0
in the early days , the pressure to both be perfect and look perfect was always on – and her choice of eye - catching clothes raised eyebrows among advisers			0
she examined all of her outfits , realising that ‘ everything she wore carried a meaning , ’ @entity32 writes			0
she is now known for her flawless ensembles at night and outfits bought at chain stores during for the day			0
new responsibilities : the first lady was at first unsure of her role , despite her glamorous reception next to normal : mrs @entity2 had learned to dress strategically , the book says , buying clothes from high street stores to wear for everyday tasks and becoming more glamorous for evening events ‘ everyone was waiting for a black woman to make a mistake , ’ an advisor told the author			1
but she battled the pressure and fought against childhood obesity and defended her husband 's drive to reform health care			0
when @entity2 worked in the @entity188 in the early 1990s , she was ' distressed ' that a small group of ' white @entity191 ' families had such a strong grip on @entity193 , @entity32 writes			0
mrs @entity2 worked for mayor @entity194 between september 1991 and april 1993 , according to @entity195 of @entity7 personnel records			0
she was supposedly concerned about the power of three families : the @entity199 , the @entity200 and the @entity201			0
according to @entity32 , mrs. @entity2 ‘ disapproved of how closely @entity194 held power , surrounding himself with three or four people who seemed to let few outsiders in - a concern she would echo years later with her own husband			1
‘ she particularly resented the way power in @entity193 was locked up generation after generation by a small group of families , all white @entity191 - the @entity212 in @entity7 , the @entity200 and @entity201 statewide			0
’ eventually , former aides say , mrs @entity2 came to love her role as first lady			1
‘ it was natural that there would be a period of transition when she and the family went from being a private family in @entity7 to the first family of the @entity225 , ’ former @entity9 deputy communications director @entity216 told @entity217			0
the book also details the battles mrs @entity2 endured against her husband ’s aides			1
it tells of a divided @entity9 where tensions developed between mrs @entity2 and then chief of staff @entity232			1
arguably the most prominent point of contention @entity32 reveals between the first lady and mr @entity232 was the friction over healthcare reform and mrs @entity2 ’s scepticism of so - called backroom deals being cut			1
mrs @entity2 ‘ made it clear that she thought her husband needed a new team , according to her aides , ’ @entity32 writes			1
from past sour experiences with another @entity9 wife – former first lady and current secretary of state @entity248 - mr @entity232 tried to avoid mrs @entity2			1
ms @entity32 writes that the @entity250 wings became so separate from each other that some referred to the @entity253 as ‘ @entity254 – pleasant but powerless			0
’ ‘ @entity2 and @entity232 had almost no bond , ’ ms @entity32 writes , saying that from the get - go , the two were awkward			1
@entity257 : @entity2 and former chief of staff @entity232 allegedly butted heads upheaval : @entity232 , left , offered to resign as chief of staff over health reform ‘ they were the president ’s two spouses , in a sense , one public and official and one private and informal			1
’ the @entity9 had a cold reaction to the book , calling it an ' over-dramatisation of old news ' and emphasising that the first couple did not speak to the author , who last interviewed them for magazine piece in 2009			0
' the emotions , thoughts and private moments described in the book , though often seemingly ascribed to the president and first lady , reflect little more than the author 's own thoughts , ' @entity9 spokesman @entity276 said			2
' these secondhand accounts are staples of every administration in modern political history and often exaggerated			0
' the accounts are based on interviews with 30 current and former aides , though president @entity292 and the first lady declined to be interviewed for the book .			2

new book claims first lady wanted to wait a year to join her husband
she feared the ' presidential race was potentially a curse upon her children '
despite *appearances* , she had an ' unhappy , difficult time in her new role '
butted heads with @entity2 's aides , particularly chief of staff @entity232
