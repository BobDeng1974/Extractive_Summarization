by @entity0 from the construction of its fragile bone structure , to the development of individual organs and the sprouting of feathers - this video may make you think twice about eating quail eggs			0
a doctor from @entity11 created the time - lapse movie of a developing quail embryo using more than 1,000 separate images taken using a microscope			1
it has now been awarded first place in the third annual @entity19 photomicrography competition			1

it has now been awarded first place in the third annual @entity19 in motion photomicrography competition the @entity28 launched in 1975 to celebrate photographers who use a light microscope , also known as photomicrographers			1
in 2011 , @entity19 announced it would start accepting movies taken through the microscope as a new category			2
this category , called @entity36 accepts any video or digital time - lapse photography taken through the microscope			1
photographers can use any type of light microscopy technique , including phase contrast , polarised light , fluorescence , interference contrast , darkfield , confocal , deconvolution , and mixed techniques , as well as record any subject matter			0

the winning embryo video was made by dr. @entity71 of the @entity72 and @entity73 in @entity11			2
his 3d reconstruction of the embryo includes ‘ virtual ’ slices taken during 10 days of in - egg gestation			2
@entity78 of the @entity79 in @entity80 won second place with his video showing the beating heart of a two - day old zebrafish embryo			1
@entity78 of the @entity79 in @entity80 won second place with his video showing the beating heart of a two - day old zebrafish embryo , pictured			1
the heart is only 250 micrometres big , or just slightly larger than the diameter of a human hair it was reconstructed in @entity91 after being captured using light sheet fluorescence microscopy in the living zebrafish			0
the heart is only 250 micrometres big , or just slightly larger than the diameter of a human hair			0
in one shot , viewers can see the movement of blood cells through the heart and its adjacent vessels			0
third place went to dr. @entity103 of the @entity104 , @entity105 for his video of a live @entity107 , or cancer , cell			2
it shows , for the first time , the inner details of the mitochondria in a living cell within a 3d image and was created using 50 time points			2
third place went to dr. @entity103 of the @entity104 for his video of a live @entity107 , or cancer cell , pictured			1
it shows , for the first time , the inner details of the mitochondria in a living cell within a 3d image and was created using 50 time points ‘ once again , @entity19 received an incredible number of entries for @entity36 , but this year ’s crop of winners showcase truly incredible and ground - breaking techniques that push the boundaries of imaging , ’ said @entity124 , communications and @entity127 manager , for @entity19			1
‘ these videos embrace the very spirit of this competition , which aims to remind us all that cutting - edge science and imaging are not only happening every day , but can be artistically intriguing as well			0
’ @entity141 awarded three winners with a first , second , and third place prize , and will award an additional 10 entries with honourable mentions throughout 2014			0
the judges were science educator and journalist @entity146 and @entity149 , director of the @entity151 and @entity150 at the @entity152 at @entity153			0
first place : dr. @entity71 of the @entity72 and @entity73 in @entity11 second place : @entity78 of the @entity79 in @entity80 third place : dr. @entity103 of the @entity104 , @entity105			0
