@entity0 earned a hard - fought point at the @entity2 after coming from behind to draw 1 - 1 against @entity3			1
@entity4 put the home side ahead before @entity6 showed his poacher 's instinct to level the score			1
here , @entity10 runs through how the players performed			0
@entity20 had a right to be annoyed			0
@entity25 - 5.5 needed the help of @entity27 to stop the persistent @entity0 raids down their left - hand side			1
stuck to the task though			0
@entity4 - 7 former @entity0 trainee reacted like a instinctive striker to volley in @entity34 's header inside two minutes but was later taken in by @entity36 's flick - on for the equaliser			1
@entity4 ( left ) turns away in celebration after putting @entity3 ahead at the @entity2 @entity39 - 6 used all the experience gained in the @entity42 game by breaking up play with ' professional ' fouls when the occasion dictated it			1
nowhere near @entity6 for the equaliser and nearly gifted @entity48 an injury - time winner but recovered to stop the ball reaching him			2
@entity51 - 6 excellent delivery when he got forward but defensively was pulled around too much by @entity0 's quicksilver forwards			1
@entity55 - 6 overshadowed for once by @entity56 in the central midfield area			2
found @entity21 's clever movement a problem and gave away free - kicks			0
@entity55 ( left ) of @entity3 challenges @entity0 captain @entity21 for the ball @entity56 - 6.5 did the ugly defensive work in midfield with real aplomb , always prepared to put his foot in to get a tackle on the likes of @entity21			1
@entity70 - 7 erratic and unpredictable but pure quality at other times			0
his range of passing meant the injured @entity76 was n't missed as much as feared			0
fantastic free - kick led to @entity34 hitting the post and his set pieces were always a threat			2
@entity27 - 6 work - rate never in doubt but lucky not to gift @entity0 a penalty when he blocked @entity87 's cross with his hand			1
his battle with @entity87 was one of the game 's highlights			0
@entity3 's @entity27 ( left ) and @entity87 of @entity0 compete for the ball at the @entity2 @entity94 - 6.5 no wonder @entity96 says he will miss the forward when he goes to the @entity98 this month with @entity99			1
harried the @entity0 defence and dispossessed @entity101 before shooting wide			0
had a cracking shot deflected wide by @entity103			0
@entity34 - 8 a real handful who gave @entity0 's defence problems throughout			1
showed why @entity3 wo n't want to lose him in january by cleverly peeling away to the edge of the box to set up the early goal for @entity4 with a great header			1
appealed strongly for a penalty when another header hit @entity103 on the arm and also hit the post			0
@entity34 ( left ) of @entity3 is brought down by @entity116 of @entity0 on @entity117 @entity118 : @entity119 ( for @entity120 81 ) subs not used : @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 manager : @entity96 - 7 the @entity3 boss felt there was a weakness in @entity0 's defence and tried to exploit it with the size of @entity34 and pace of @entity94			1
@entity3 's set - piece delivery was excellent			1
@entity0 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) @entity137 - 6 does n't relish coming to the @entity138 and though he was n't overworked he allowed @entity4 to score inside the six yard box and was helpless when @entity34 beat @entity103 in the air and headed against the upright			1
@entity116 - 6 needed all his physical attributes in a heavyweight battle with @entity34 and gave as good as he got after a disastrous start when he let the 6ft 7in centre forward set up the first goal			2
@entity103 - 6.5 as the main central defender , it was n't great that @entity34 and then @entity4 had time in the box when @entity3 scored from their early corner			1
improved as the match wore on and got a vital block to deflect @entity94 's goalbound shot wide			0
@entity3 felt they should have had a penalty though when @entity34 's header hit him on the arm			1
@entity101 ( right ) slipped in the first half and @entity94 should have doubled @entity3 's lead @entity101 - 5 one player who just has n't looked comfortable for some reason with @entity163 's three at the back			1
hesitated when put under pressure by @entity94 and fortunate the @entity3 forward missed and nervy throughout			2
@entity166 - 6 has been the most improved @entity0 player under @entity12			2
having played on the left in recent weeks , he switched to the right to accommodate @entity87 and mucked in for his team , even winning defensive headers			0
@entity87 - 7.5 impressive energy given that it was the youngster 's first start for six weeks after injury			0
got forward from wingback and could have won a penalty when @entity27 handled his cross			0
@entity36 ( right ) jumps to compete for the ball with @entity3 's @entity56 @entity36 - 7 showed there is more to his game than clever passing when he got in ahead of team - mate @entity116 to expertly flick on @entity21 's corner for @entity6 to score			1
@entity187 - 5.5 one of those afternoons			0
a windy , cloudy wet day in @entity3 when the @entity189 could n't get on the ball consistently to influence things			0
his recent form has been good but his place remains vulnerable once @entity194 is fit again allowing @entity21 to push further up			0
@entity21 - 6.5 his early frustrations included a slip and vainly appealing for a penalty but those were eradicated when his excellent right - foot corner led to a @entity0 equaliser			2
he is becoming a genuine leader in the team			0
@entity0 captain @entity21 ( right ) runs with the ball as @entity25 looks on @entity20 - 5.5 largely anonymous in the first half but became embroiled in some handbags with @entity205 after the keeper aimed his studs at him as he collected an attempted @entity21 through - ball			2
had one sight of goal late on and his volley was just wide			0
@entity6 - 6.5 has to be right up there among the @entity216 's best penalty - area finishers			2
reacted quicker than anyone else to convert @entity36 's flick and make it 1 - 1			1
ca n't be left alone for a moment			0
@entity6 ( second right ) showed his poacher 's instinct to scored @entity0 's equaliser @entity118 : @entity225 ( for @entity6 64 ) 5.5 , @entity226 ( for @entity87 64 ) 5.5 , @entity227 75 ) subs not used : @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity125 manager : @entity163 - 6.5 credit for picking such an attacking line - up at @entity3 with @entity6 , @entity48 , @entity21 and @entity187 all starting			1
they did create chances but were left vulnerable at the back			0
referee @entity239 - 6.5 @entity3 will feel he should have awarded them a penalty at 1 - 1 when the ball hit @entity103 on the arm after an effort from @entity34 , but @entity239 will feel the @entity0 defender was so close he would n't have been able to get out the way			1
@entity0 arguably had an even better case after @entity27 blocked @entity87 's cross with his hand			2
kept the game flowing though and did n't have to book anyone in a rumbustious contest			0
@entity3 players surround referee @entity239 after he failed to award a penalty at the @entity2			2

@entity3 drew 1 - 1 with @entity0 at the @entity2
@entity4 put @entity3 ahead after two minutes on @entity117
@entity6 equalised from close range for @entity0
@entity36 was excellent in midfield for @entity163 's men
@entity34 and @entity4 impressed for the home side
