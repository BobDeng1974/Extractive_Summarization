by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 3 may 2013 at first glance , they look like elaborately - patterned tea cosies			0
but these wooly designs are actually adorable outfits for tortoises - and are flying off the creators knitting needles			1
tortoise - lover @entity10 started crocheting the outfits for her seven pet tortoises as a family joke			1
i came across a picture of a tortoise with a doily on its shell , and had a good laugh ' @entity10 has seven tortoises and says she loves their ' wise eyes ' and how no one is frightened of them but after posting pictures of the cosy outfits on her tortoise blog , she was soon inundated with requests to make them for tortoises around the globe			1
and now tortoises around the world are being decked out dressed as sharks , pumpkins - or just in pretty patterns			1
@entity10 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , said : ' my first cozy started out as a fun little joke			1
i came across a picture of a tortoise with a doily on its shell , and had a good laugh			0
' i decided to take it a step further , and crocheted a few little cozies in simple designs , tried them on my tortoises , and took pictures			1
do n't go into the water ! the wacky designs range from vegetables to great white shark outfits it takes roughly up to 40 minutes to create each suit , which are now sold on @entity10 's online @entity71 shop a new look ! this tortoise gets a bright makeover with this wooly creation , which resembles a dinosaur ' i posted pictures on my tortoise blog and shared them on one of the tortoise forums , and very quickly , they became popular			1
' i started getting requests to make them to sell , so i listed some in my tortoise - themed @entity71 shop			0
they started selling as fast as i could make them , so i just kept making more			0
' i enjoy coming up with different designs , and have a few more up my sleeve that i have n't started making yet			2
' i found that they were really handy for spotting the tortoises quickly when i had let them out in the garden - i can see where they are immediately			2
' mother - of - two @entity10 , 36 , has seven tortoises - but has had to take to taking her yarn and crochet hooks wherever she goes , to fill every spare moment with knitting the creations			1
all doil - ed up ! this tortoise gets a vibrant new look with this lavender ensemble this reptile looks positively cuddly in this bright outfit , that was created by the mother - of - two and has proved hugely popular with tortoise owners the bright designs are handy for spotting the tortoises quickly when they are let out in the garden - so they are never lost in the grass knitting up a storm : the mother says her work started selling as fast as she could make them she added : ' if i can work without interruption , it takes roughly up to 40 minutes to create each suit , depending on the design			2
' i love treating my pets			0
i rescued three of my tortoises , one of them , @entity121 , was forgotten in a barn stall and was n't given food or water for six months before he came into my care			2
' some creature had bitten his feet , and he was terribly ill. yet , with proper care , food , water and warmth , he is now a happy , healthy little fella who will likely live for another 100 years			0
' tortoises are living fossils , they have survived since around the time of dinosaurs			2
some say they have been around for more than 400 million years ! it never ceases to amaze me how tough and well - adjusted to their environment they are			0
' their wise old eyes will follow you around with such interest when you are within view of the enclosure			0
i have yet to meet a person who is afraid of a tortoise , which ca n't be said of most reptiles			0
