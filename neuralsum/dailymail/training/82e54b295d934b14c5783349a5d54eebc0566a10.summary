by @entity0 a mother has baffled doctors by beating one of the most malignant brain cancers known to man before going on to have a healthy baby girl for good measure			2
@entity7 was given just six months to live when she was diagnosed with not one , but two tumours by the age of 26 - the second one described as ' uniformly fatal '			1
but now , six years later , doctors are at pains to explain how there is not a single trace of the disease left on her brain			1
' @entity17 had a plan for me ' : @entity7 pictured with husband @entity20 and daughter @entity21 , whom she was able to have after beating one of the most malignant brain tumours known mrs @entity7 continued to break the ' biological rules ' by giving birth to daughter @entity21 , now aged seven months , last year despite undergoing intense radiation that often leaves women infertile			1
mrs @entity7 , now 32 , said @entity17 ' had a plan ' for her and never once thought she would succumb to the disease			1
she told @entity31 : ' the mind is so much more powerful than anyone can imagine			0
i never once thought it would be the death of me			0
' mrs @entity7 was working as a doctor 's receptionist in 2005 when she was diagnosed with her first cancer after she noticed visual problems driving home one day			1
amazing : on a patient profile posted online ( left ) , mrs @entity7 credits medical marijuana in aiding her radiotherapy treatment which has led to a miraculous recovery that has stumped doctors ( right , file picture ) @entity47 ( @entity47 ) is the most common and most aggressive malignant brain tumours			1
unlike other cancers , which are more likely to strike as patients get older , @entity47 is just as prevalent in young patients and kills more people under 40 than any other cancer			0
common symptoms include seizure , nausea , vomiting and headaches , although the most prevalent is a progressive memory , personality , or neurological deterioration becuase of its location near the temporal and frontal lobes			0
the average sufferer will only survive for 14 months after diagnosis and 2,500 die from their tumours annually			2
@entity47 is extremely difficult to treat for a number of reasons because the tumour cells are very resistant to conventional therapies			0
senator @entity74 , above , died from the disease in august 2009			2
an mri scan revealed a low - grade tumour pressing on her visual reception cord and she underwent successful surgery and chemotherapy			0
but less than a year later , doctors discovered a stage 4 glioblastoma - a far more aggressive tumour which killed senator @entity74 in 2009			0
mrs @entity7 opted to have the growth partially removed as any cutting any more out left her at risk of being paralysed			1
this was followed by more intense radiotherapy before being given the all - clear			2
dr @entity91 , director of the @entity92 at @entity94 's @entity93 in @entity95 who operated on mrs @entity7 , said he had never seen such a recovery from a stage 4 glioblastoma like it in his 35 years as a neurosurgeon			1
he told @entity31 : ' it 's one of the most malignant tumors there is and it 's uniformly fatal			1
' i would not feel comfortable calling it a cure , but there is no evidence of a tumor			0
' during her treatment , she met and married @entity114 , a 54 - year - old engineer			0
they both desperately wanted children and fortunately the radiation had left some of her eggs in tact , one of which was used in a surrogate mother to give birth to @entity21			1
' there have been so many miracles , ' said mrs @entity7			2
' one after another , as my dad said , so many angels must be sitting on my shoulders			0

@entity7 was diagnosed with not one , but two tumours by age of 26
says ' @entity17 had a plan for me ' as scans now show no trace of the disease
surgeon : ' it 's one of most malignant tumours . her survival is remarkable '
despite intense radiation , she was able to use an egg to have daughter @entity21
