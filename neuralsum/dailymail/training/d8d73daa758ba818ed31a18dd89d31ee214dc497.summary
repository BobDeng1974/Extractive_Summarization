by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 09:40 est , 20 november 2013 archaeologists trying to uncover the mystery of @entity3 have been digging around the wrong hill for almost a century			2
teams of archaeologists have spent the past 90 years scouring the @entity6 in @entity7 to find the source of the prehistoric monument 's iconic ' blue stones '			1
scientists believed the 11 stones used to construct the ancient site came from a hill called @entity15 , but geologists have since discovered they actually came from another hill - just over a mile away - called @entity18			1
scientists believed the 11 ' bluestones ' used to build the outer ring of @entity3 , pictured , came from @entity15 in the @entity22 of @entity7 , @entity23			1
however , new x-rays confirm they actually came from @entity18 , a hill situated just a mile away a paper published by academic @entity27 in 1923 was the first to suggest the stones came from @entity7			1
the region of the @entity6 in the @entity30 is renowned for blue stones that resemble those used to build @entity3			1
@entity27 claimed the particular dolerites that make up the ancient site came from a hill called @entity15 , and archaeologists have been digging on this location for the past 90 years in search of human activity			1
however , researchers from the @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 recently wanted to pinpoint the exact location			0
they x-rayed the 11 bluestones in @entity46 and discovered they more equally matched stones found on a hill called @entity18 - just a mile away from @entity15			1
now archaeologists plan to move to the new site			0
now archaeologists are planning to move to the new site			0
they can then start trying to discover if prehistoric man cut the 11 stone monoliths from the hill and transported them to the prehistoric site , or if they were carried there by glaciers during the last @entity57			0
dr @entity58 from the @entity41 is a leading authority on volcanic rocks and has been studying the @entity6 since he was a phd student in the late 1970s			0
working with dr @entity62 of @entity42 and professor @entity63 of @entity64 , dr @entity58 used a paper published by academic @entity27 in 1923 as their starting point			2
@entity27 's paper was the first to put forward the theory that the blue stones of @entity3 came from @entity7			1
in particular , it said they came from a @entity73 called @entity15 and ever since then archaeologists have assumed that to be the case			2
but dr @entity58 said : ' when @entity27 was doing his research , it was n't possible for him to be as precise as we can now			0
dolerites found on the hill of @entity18 , pictured , match those used to build the ancient monument			2
however , it is still not known how the large stones travelled the 160 miles from @entity23 to @entity46 , where @entity3 was built a paper published in 1923 was the first to suggest the stones came from @entity7			1
it claimed the particular dolerites that make up the ancient site came from a hill called @entity15 , pictured , and archaeologists have been digging on this incorrect location for the past 90 years in search of human activity ' by x-raying dolerites from @entity3 and comparing them with dolerites from @entity18 , we know with some degree of certainty that is where the blue stones originated			1
' this is an incredibly exciting project and we got confirmation last week that our findings have been verified , ' continued dr @entity58			0
' getting such positive feedback was a great relief			0
' after this , i do n't expect to be getting @entity110 cards from the archaeologists who have been excavating at the wrong place over all these years ! ' @entity3 was built and altered over a period of about 1,000 years , starting around 2,600 @entity114 are two types of stones at @entity3 - the larger sarsens and the smaller outer rings of blue stones			1
scientists initially thought the blue stones came from @entity15 in @entity7 yet x-rays have revealed they came from @entity18 just a mile away			1
it is unclear how they travelled the 160 miles from @entity23 to @entity3 in @entity46 @entity3 was built and altered over a period of about 1,000 years , starting around 2,600 bc. there are two types of stones at @entity3 - the larger sarsens and the smaller outer rings of bluestones , which are now known to have come from @entity18 , pictured the bluestones come from the @entity6 of @entity7 but how the stones were transported over 160 miles to @entity3 remains a mystery			1
dr @entity58 said there were competing theories but now archaeologists could finally solve the mystery now they 've uncovered the stones ' precise source			2
he said : ' some have suggested they were transported by humans south to @entity138 , put on boats and taken by sea to a point from which they were carried to @entity142			0
archaeologists are now planning to move from @entity15 to @entity18 , pictured , to study the area			2
dr @entity58 from the @entity41 is a leading authority on volcanic rocks and has been studying the @entity6 since he was a phd student in the late 1970s ' others have suggested they may have been transported naturally by rock movements during the last @entity57			0
it 's not for me to say which of the theories is correct			0
' if humans were involved in taking the stones , there should be some evidence of human activity at the site			2
but if they were transported during the last @entity57 , physical evidence should be present			0
' we are publishing our findings and it will be for specialist archaeologists to use their expertise to excavate the site and see what physical evidence they can find			0
' dr @entity58 and the team of geologists will have their peer - reviewed paper published by the @entity172 next year .			0

@entity3 's outer ring is made up of 11 large dolerites called blue stones
a 1923 paper claimed the stones were from @entity15 in @entity7
for 90 years archaeologists have searched this location for human activity
yet x-rays confirm the stones came from @entity18 - just a mile away
it 's still not known how the stones travelled the 160 miles to @entity46
