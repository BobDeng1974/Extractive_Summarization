new @entity1 coach @entity0 is aiming to make his stint in charge memorable on the pitch , and he is looking to turn heads off it as well , judging by the club 's clobber			2
@entity0 took a group of his players to the @entity11 in @entity12 where @entity1 are conducting their pre-season tour and they brought back memories of @entity16 's infamous ' @entity15 ' who wore cream @entity19 suits before the 1996 fa cup final			1
@entity16 lost that final 1 - 0 to @entity22 , but @entity1 are sure to hope the look works out better for them			2
the former @entity1 striker replaced @entity45 after the @entity46 was sacked less than six months into his reign after failing to qualify for @entity48 and rumours of dressing - room splits			0
he has already lost @entity51 to @entity54 side @entity52 and there are rumours that @entity57 could also be set to leave the @entity58 this summer			0
if that is the case @entity0 will need his team to put in some performances as sharp as their look			0
spice boy : @entity65 before the 1996 fa cup final when @entity16 played @entity22 @entity66 contrast : @entity22 players admire @entity16 's brave approach to fashion dapper : @entity72 and @entity73 look sharp in their designer suits homegrown : @entity72 and @entity76 were both products of @entity16 's academy system			1
