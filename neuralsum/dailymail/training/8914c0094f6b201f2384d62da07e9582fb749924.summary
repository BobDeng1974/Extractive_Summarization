@entity0 releases new figures which show no warming in 15 years the supposed ‘ consensus ’ on man - made global warming is facing an inconvenient challenge after the release of new temperature data showing the planet has not warmed for the past 15 years			1
the figures suggest that we could even be heading for a mini ice age to rival the 70 - year temperature drop that saw frost fairs held on the @entity13 in the @entity14			1
based on readings from more than 30,000 measuring stations , the data was issued last week without fanfare by the @entity0 and the @entity20 @entity19			1
it confirms that the rising trend in world temperatures ended in 1997			2
a painting , dated 1684 , by @entity25 depicts one of many frost fairs on the @entity13 during the mini ice age meanwhile , leading climate scientists yesterday told @entity30 that , after emitting unusually high levels of energy throughout the @entity34 , the sun is now heading towards a ‘ grand minimum ’ in its output , threatening cold summers , bitter winters and a shortening of the season available for growing food			2
solar output goes through 11 - year cycles , with high numbers of sunspots seen at their peak			2
we are now at what should be the peak of what scientists call ‘ @entity51 ’ – which is why last week ’s solar storm resulted in sightings of the aurora borealis further south than usual			2
but sunspot numbers are running at less than half those seen during cycle peaks in the @entity34			2
analysis by experts at @entity60 and the @entity61 – derived from magnetic - field measurements 120,000 miles beneath the sun ’s surface – suggest that @entity65 , whose peak is due in 2022 , will be a great deal weaker still			2
according to a paper issued last week by the @entity0 , there is a 92 per cent chance that both @entity65 and those taking place in the following decades will be as weak as , or weaker than , the ‘ @entity73 ’ of 1790 to 1830			1
in this period , named after the meteorologist @entity75 , average temperatures in parts of @entity78 fell by @entity79			2
however , it is also possible that the new solar energy slump could be as deep as the ‘ @entity84 ’ ( after astronomer @entity85 ) , between 1645 and 1715 in the coldest part of the ‘ @entity87 ’ when , as well as the @entity13 frost fairs , the canals of @entity81 froze solid			2
yet , in its paper , the @entity0 claimed that the consequences now would be negligible – because the impact of the sun on climate is far less than man - made carbon dioxide			1
although the sun ’s output is likely to decrease until 2100 , ‘ this would only cause a reduction in global temperatures of @entity98			0
’ @entity101 , one of the authors , said : ‘ our findings suggest a reduction of solar activity to levels not seen in hundreds of years would be insufficient to offset the dominant influence of greenhouse gases			1
’ these findings are fiercely disputed by other solar experts			0
‘ world temperatures may end up a lot cooler than now for 50 years or more , ’ said @entity111 , director of the @entity112 at @entity114 ’s @entity113			1
‘ it will take a long battle to convince some climate scientists that the sun is important			0
it may well be that the sun is going to demonstrate this on its own , without the need for their help			0
’ he pointed out that , in claiming the effect of the solar minimum would be small , the @entity0 was relying on the same computer models that are being undermined by the current pause in global - warming			1
@entity133 levels have continued to rise without interruption and , in 2007 , the @entity0 claimed that global warming was about to ‘ come roaring back ’			1
it said that between 2004 and 2014 there would be an overall increase of @entity138			0
in 2009 , it predicted that at least three of the years 2009 to 2014 would break the previous temperature record set in 1998			1
so far there is no sign of any of this happening			0
but yesterday a @entity0 spokesman insisted its models were still valid			1
‘ the ten - year projection remains groundbreaking science			0
the period for the original projection is not over yet , ’ he said			0
dr @entity150 , of @entity151 in @entity152 , is the author of several papers that argue the @entity0 climate models show there should have been ‘ steady warming from 2000 until now ’			1
‘ if temperatures continue to stay flat or start to cool again , the divergence between the models and recorded data will eventually become so great that the whole scientific community will question the current theories , ’ he said			0
he believes that as the @entity0 model attaches much greater significance to co2 than to the sun , it was bound to conclude that there would not be cooling			1
‘ the real issue is whether the model itself is accurate , ’ dr @entity150 said			0
meanwhile , one of @entity175 ’s most eminent climate experts , professor @entity176 of the @entity177 , said she found the @entity0 ’s confident prediction of a ‘ negligible ’ impact difficult to understand			1
‘ the responsible thing to do would be to accept the fact that the models may have severe shortcomings when it comes to the influence of the sun , ’ said professor @entity176			0
as for the warming pause , she said that many scientists ‘ are not surprised ’			1
she argued it is becoming evident that factors other than @entity133 play an important role in rising or falling warmth , such as the 60 - year water temperature cycles in the @entity195 and @entity197 oceans			0
‘ they have insufficiently been appreciated in terms of global climate , ’ said prof @entity176			0
when both oceans were cold in the past , such as from 1940 to 1970 , the climate cooled			0
the @entity195 cycle ‘ flipped ’ back from warm to cold mode in 2008 and the @entity197 is also thought likely to flip in the next few years			1
@entity205 , senior adviser at the @entity206 , said some scientists found the importance of water cycles difficult to accept , because doing so means admitting that the oceans – not @entity133 – caused much of the global warming between 1970 and 1997			1
the same goes for the impact of the sun – which was highly active for much of the @entity34			0
‘ nature is about to carry out a very interesting experiment , ’ he said			0
‘ ten or 15 years from now , we will be able to determine much better whether the warming of the @entity34 really was caused by man - made @entity133 , or by natural variability			1
’ meanwhile , since the end of last year , world temperatures have fallen by more than half a degree , as the cold ‘ @entity225 ’ effect has re-emerged in the @entity195			0
‘ we ’re now well into the second decade of the pause , ’ said @entity226 , director of the @entity227			0
‘ if we do n’t see convincing evidence of global warming by 2015 , it will start to become clear whether the models are bunk			2
and , if they are , the implications for some scientists could be very serious			0
