@entity1 disease : it 's an autoimmune condition triggered by the protein gluten , found in wheat @entity5 knew she needed help when her bloating problem became so bad her wedding ring had to be cut off			1
for nearly 30 years , she wore elasticated waistbands because her stomach bloated so much after meals			0
' i could balloon a dress size in a few hours - it was embarrassing			0
people were forever asking if i was pregnant ' , recalls @entity5 , 50 , who runs an insulation company with husband @entity17 , 52 , and lives in @entity18 , @entity19			0
' i suffered numerous griping tummy pains and diarrhoea			0
the symptoms seemed to happen at any time			0
' she also felt drained and had no energy , and eventually she reached a stage where her finger joints started to swell up immediately after eating			0
@entity5 struggled for years to get a correct diagnosis and treatment			0
she first saw a doctor about her tummy pains aged eight , and was told she had a ' grumbling appendix ' - chronic pain in the appendix			2
in her 20s - underweight at 8st 7lb ( she 's 5ft 10in tall ) and constantly exhausted - she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity36 ) and told to eat more fibre			0
but doing so made her symptoms worse			0
' i could never be far from a loo and felt permanently exhausted , ' recalls @entity5			0
' i went back to my gp a few times but was told i was suffering “ stress ”			0
' from my late 20s i started gaining weight - 4st in all - until reaching 13st in my late 40s - despite eating child - sized portions			0
' two years ago on holiday in @entity47 , @entity5 noticed her symptoms intensified when she had crusty bread , pastries and croissants			0
' i was doubled up with cramps and diarrhoea			0
later a friend suggested cutting out bread			0
i did and my symptoms improved			0
i also tried avoiding similar foods including pasta			0
' it was trial and error , but i noticed my symptoms became milder , and seemed only to return when eating wheat			2
i started losing weight and had more energy			0
' last year , @entity5 had blood tests and was found to be severely anaemic and deficient in vitamin @entity64 - both can be symptoms of coeliac disease , an autoimmune condition triggered by the protein gluten , found in wheat			1
antibodies attack the gluten , mistaking it for a foreign body , and attack the villi - finger - like projections which line the small intestine and absorb food			2
this disrupts the absorption of nutrients and can result in malnutrition			0
ballooning tummy : one of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity is bloating one per cent of the @entity85 population is estimated to have coeliac disease , often undiagnosed			1
symptoms can include bloating , abdominal pain , diarrhoea , constipation , joint pain and swelling , rashes and fatigue			1
eventually , @entity5 was referred to a gastroenterologist , who gave her a biopsy ( to check for damage to the gut lining )			0
he explained she needed to eat gluten again for two months before having blood tests to check for coeliac disease , as they measure antibodies to gluten - these markers will not be present if you are not eating gluten			1
her symptoms flared again - yet her blood tests and biopsy were normal and @entity5 was told she did not have coeliac disease			1
but her doctor said she had a lesser - known but possibly more common condition , non-coeliac gluten sensitivity ( @entity116 )			1
patients with it display gluten sensitivity symptoms including bloating , diarrhoea and tummy pain , but test negative for the disease despite symptoms disappearing on a gluten - free diet			1
however , these symptoms are caused by a different mechanism , although it 's not clear what this is ( the swelling of the fingers and toes is possibly linked to fluid leaking from swollen tissues )			0
it is a controversial diagnosis : many doctors are sceptical about the existence of the condition because there 's no diagnostic test or clear cause			2
but dr @entity143 , consultant gastroenterologist at @entity18 , says : ' i 've seen many patients with coeliac - type symptoms including bloating , diarrhoea and fatigue , but their results were negative			1
some said their symptoms improved on a gluten - free diet			1
it is becoming clear that there are patients with gluten sensitivity in whom neither allergic nor autoimmune mechanisms can be identified			1
' it is estimated that , for every person with coeliac disease , there could be six or seven with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity			1
' it may therefore affect 6 to 10 per cent of the population , approximately four to seven million @entity85 , and the vast majority are unaware of it			1
' our diet has changed in the past ten to 20 years - we now eat more carbohydrates containing gluten than our ancestors , so our digestive systems could be finding it difficult to adapt			2
' it 's thought some cases of @entity36 may , in fact , be non-coeliac gluten sensitivity			1
and the condition might help explain the prevalence of ' wheat intolerance ' , an often self - diagnosed condition commonly regarded as faddy eating			1
dr @entity184 , emeritus consultant gastroenterologist at the @entity185 , who wrote one of the first papers on the condition more than 30 years ago , says growing evidence shows non-coeliac gluten sensitivity exists , and that patients respond to a gluten - free diet despite testing negative for coeliac disease			1
' [ @entity194 gluten sensitivity ] is a controversial diagnosis : many doctors are sceptical about the existence of the condition because there 's no diagnostic test or clear cause			1
' @entity194 gluten sensitivity is on the research agenda again - driven by the public			1
in the @entity204 , 20 per cent of people buy gluten - free food and a study in children in @entity208 found gluten avoidance was five times higher than diagnosed coeliac disease			1
' in 2010 , @entity212 researchers found 24 of 120 patients with @entity36 experienced an improvement when avoiding wheat and dairy			2
in another study , published last year in the @entity218 , 34 patients with @entity36 who controlled symptoms with a gluten - free diet , but tested negative for coeliac disease , were put on a diet containing gluten or a placebo			1
those eating gluten experienced symptoms again			2
professor @entity228 , a consultant gastroenterologist at @entity229 and chair of the charity @entity231 's @entity231 , accepts studies have established patients with gluten sensitivity symptoms improve on a gluten - free diet			1
' there is emerging evidence these patients may have a biological basis for their symptoms			2
but the jury 's still out			0
' our problem is we do n't know how @entity116 is caused and how our immune system responds ; we also have n't got a test for it			0
there 's this mismatch between what doctors know and what the public are reporting			0
' he added that in a new survey of 1,000 people about to be published , 13 per cent reported symptoms after eating gluten			2
' clearly all these people do n't have coeliac disease and most would test negative for it - but what they might have instead is @entity116 or even a wheat allergy			1
' what complicates matters is more recent studies suggest it might not just be the gluten in wheat which is the problem , but the husk , or sugars in the grain			2
' professor @entity228 stressed that patients suspecting a problem with gluten should not abstain from it without first seeing their gp and being tested for coeliac disease and wheat allergy			1
' if both conditions have been eliminated it might be worth trying a gluten - free diet , ' dr @entity283 , consultant gastroenterologist at @entity284 and the private @entity285			2
' i 've no doubt patients with these symptoms have something medically wrong despite testing negative for coeliac disease - some show me pictures of their bellies sticking out after eating bread			1
' whatever the views of the scientific community , @entity5 says her diagnosis has made a world of difference			0
' i 've lost 2st and am symptom - free if i avoid gluten			2
i 've got my energy back and my tummy 's no longer bloated			0
' there must be others out there like me soldiering on - told they do n't have coeliac disease - but it 's still gluten that 's to blame			1

coeliac disease is a condition triggered by gluten , which is found in wheat
1 *%* of the @entity85 population is estimated to have the disease
symptoms include bloating , abdominal pain , diarrhoea , and constipation
non-coeliac gluten sensitivity is a lesser - known but more common condition
patients who have it display symptoms but test negative for the illness
