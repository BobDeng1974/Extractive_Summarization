by @entity0 @entity2 men have to register for the draft so if their country calls they can answer			1
there is , however , a limit to serving your country			0
a line that the @entity10 seems to have overlooked by sending draft registration notices to 14,250 @entity13 men born from 1893 to 1897			1
failure to register is ' punishable by a fine and imprisonment ' potential draft dodgers are warned			1
when puzzled family members began calling the agency realised its error			2
in this photo taken on tuesday , july 8 , 2014 , @entity21 sits behind his wife , @entity23 , in their @entity26 , @entity25 , home			1
@entity23 holds a letter from the @entity10 for her late father , @entity28 , requiring him to register for the nation 's military draft			1
the letter arrived too late for @entity28 , who was born in 1894 and died on april 20 , 1992			2
( @entity31 photo / the @entity32 , @entity33 ) @entity34 , 73 , of @entity35 , revealed that he got a notice addressed to his late grandfather @entity37 , a veteran of the @entity38 who was born in 1894 and died in 1995 at the age of 100			0
' i said , " jeez , what the hell is this about ? " it said he was subject to heavy fines and imprisonment if he did n't sign up for the draft board , ' he said			1
' we were just totally dumbfounded			0
' mr @entity37 tried calling the @entity10 but could n't get through to a human being			1
that frustrated him even more because he wanted to make sure the agency knew that there had been a mistake			0
' you just never know			0
you do n't want to mess around with the federal government , ' he said			0
the mistake , it turns out , originated with the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) during a transfer of nearly 400,000 records to the @entity10			1
a clerk working with the state 's database failed to select the century , producing records for males born between 1993 and 1997 â€” and for those born a century earlier , @entity59 spokesman @entity62 admitted yesterday			1
' we made a mistake , a quite serious selection error , ' miss @entity69 said			1
the @entity10 did not initially catch the mistake because the state used a two - digit code to indicate year of birth , spokesman @entity73 said			2
the federal agency identified 27,218 records of men born in the 1800s , began mailing notices to them on june 30 , and began receiving calls from family members on july 3			1
by that time , it had sent 14,250 notices in error			2
' it 's never happened before , ' @entity73 said			0
the men are almost certainly all dead , given that the youngest would be turning 117 this year			0
families of those men who received the notices can simply ignore them , he said			0
their files will be deactivated and they should n't receive additional communications from the @entity10			2
the agency also posted a notice and an apology on its website			0
the @entity100 , meanwhile , said that it had taken steps to ensure its mistake wo n't be repeated			0
' we 're really sorry , ' @entity69 said			0
