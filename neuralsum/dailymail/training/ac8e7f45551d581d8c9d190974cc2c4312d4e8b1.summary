‘ without statutory underpinning @entity41 ’s recommendations will not work			2
we will be left with yet another voluntary system from which the press can walk away			2
' if the prime minister did not wish to change the regulatory system even to the moderate , balanced and proportionate extent proposed by @entity41 , i am at a loss to understand why so much public money has been spent and why so many people have been asked to re-live extremely painful episodes on the stand in front of millions			1
' the 47 - year - old @entity28 author has previously told of how journalists had driven her out of her home and targeted her young daughter at school during the inquiry			2

' yesterday i sat down with the victims ’ representatives and over the coming days i will be sitting down with the industry			0
we need to work closely together and ensure that this new regulatory model is established quickly , ' she writes			0
