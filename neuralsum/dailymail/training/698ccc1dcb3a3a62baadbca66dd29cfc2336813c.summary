by @entity0 published : 03:06 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 07:02 est , 2 march 2014 i was at @entity3 on saturday for @entity5 ’s first home game in charge of @entity7 , but he took a beating and learned a lesson from @entity10			1
it ’s @entity12 weekend – and no i ’m not talking about the @entity15 @entity14 man			0
so these are the footballing @entity12 from @entity14 ’s 3 - 1 win at @entity7			2
a performance so bad it made me want to cry in the first half , he was awful			1
he could n’t kick the ball properly			0
just before half time @entity26 was in acres of space 40 yards out with time to pick a pass			2
@entity20 was waving like a crazed windmill on the left unmarked , @entity26 looked at him , and could n’t bring himself to pass to the useless @entity31			1
game of two halves : @entity14 's @entity34 was ineffective in the first - half but then scored a hat - trick as the @entity37 ran out 3 - 1 winners in the @entity39 at @entity7 off the pace : @entity20 could n't get into the game before half - time and here is muscled off the ball by @entity7 's @entity45 changed man : but after the interval , @entity20 was unplayable , scoring three times as @entity14 went four points clear at the top after listening to @entity10 ’s expletives at half time , @entity20 turned into a very good professional footballer			1
his movement was excellent , his finishing even better			0
he bagged a hat - trick , his second of the season after scoring three for @entity58 in a qualifier in @entity60			1
his goals at @entity3 were his first in a @entity14 shirt in nearly three months			0
if you want to just count up goal totals then give it to @entity68			0
but if you love football then @entity64 is the only winner			1
wizardry : @entity64 was @entity14 's stand - out performer and should be named player of the season for the purists : hazard should win the accolade for the manner in which he controls games from midfield @entity82 here to read @entity84 's report from @entity3 hazard was quiet first half but then ran the game after the break			1
his vision and execution were perfect			0
@entity7 were totally bamboozled by this genius			0
@entity64 ? more like @entity92			1
@entity93 … @entity7 chairman @entity94 said before the game that appointing a third manager this season might be considered “ unconventional or unpopular			1
” no , really ? he justified it by saying he had to do it to prevent a “ non-stop slide in the table			0
” well he ’s certainly done that			0
@entity7 are bottom and ca n’t slide any further down the table			0
fooling nobody : @entity7 owner @entity94 is onto his third manager of the season but the club 's fortunes have still not improved the ineffective @entity110 … @entity5			1
he said before the game that @entity14 have “ the mentality of champions			2
” was that designed to undermine the opponents ? make them feel over-confident or even complacent ? well it did n’t work			0
@entity14 did n’t even bother turning up for the first - half yet still made @entity7 look like a @entity120 side , which is probably what they ’ll be next season			1
message to @entity5 – do n’t mess around trying to play mind games with @entity10			1
psychological warfare : @entity7 manager @entity5 tried the mind games to try and unsettle @entity14 before the match ... but his ploy failed miserably mulling it over : magath troops off looking dejected after the 3 - 1 defeat , which left @entity7 firmly rooted to the bottom of the table the @entity134 … to @entity10 who refused to acknowledge after the game that @entity14 are top of the table			1
they ’re not only top , they ’re four points clear			0
he ’s normally so adept at the football psycho stuff , but nobody is fooled by this one , poor effort @entity10			1
all in the mind : nobody is fooled by @entity10 's claims that @entity14 are not genuine @entity148 title contenders sitting pretty : @entity14 opened up a four - point lead at the top of the @entity148 following the win the @entity152 … @entity153			1
determined to head a ball away he went in full force , no nonsense , and smashed his temple into the top of team - mate @entity161 ’s head			2
remarkably the @entity162 tried to carry on			0
it was daft to even think he could carry on			0
a bonus “ bottler ” award for @entity167 during this incident			0
the @entity170 saw the @entity161 / @entity153 sandwich coming and bottled out of it in good time - wise move			2
groggy : @entity153 collided with teammate @entity161 and had to go off with concussion the @entity176 … goes jointly to @entity177 and @entity178			1
bizarrely @entity10 claimed this week that both “ deserve ” a place in @entity181 ’s squad for @entity182			1
er … why ? just because they ’ve both played over 100 times for @entity186 ? i do n’t think so			0
much respect to both of course , but it ’s not a jolly			0
@entity181 has to balance building for the future with putting on a respectable show this summer			0
i ’m sorry but for @entity177 and @entity178 that means no trip for them in my opinion			1
@entity10 put both of them on the bench at @entity7 , and they stayed there for the full 90 minutes			1
benched : @entity178 was an unused substitute at @entity3 as his chances of going to the @entity176 fade further waning influence : @entity177 was also kept on the bench at @entity7 the @entity206 … goes to @entity14			1
or at least , it could do			0
i tipped @entity14 pre-season and i see no reason to change that			2
i ’ve seen them play terribly this season – i was at the @entity213 to watch them beaten 3 - 2 by @entity215			2
but it seems that when they ’ve learned a lot from that kind of result			0
they were so bad in the first - half at @entity7 but still ended up winning comfortably			2
@entity10 keeps insisting they ca n’t win the title , but he wo n’t mind being wrong on this one – if @entity14 are crowned champions he can heap praise on his players , and they will love him even more			2
@entity229 ’s ego will privately soak up all the praise that will inevitably head his way			0
bound for glory : @entity14 are clear favourites to win a fourth @entity148 title now @entity10 has one massive advantage over @entity236 and @entity237 ( forget @entity238			2
do i need to explain why ? ) – he knows how to win the title in @entity186 , he knows how to finish the job			0
i ca n’t see it happening but if another manager finishes above @entity10 come the end of this season then they ’ve done a brilliant job .			1

@entity5 was taught a lesson by @entity10 in first home game
@entity20 made me cry with frustration in first half
but hat - trick hero was *unstoppable* after the break
if you *'re* a *soccer* lover , @entity64 is player of the season
there 's no reason why @entity177 and @entity178 should go to @entity182
