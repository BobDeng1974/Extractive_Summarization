by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 03:35 est , 25 february 2013 it details the environmental impact of the new high - speed rail line			2
alas , at 50,000 pages - the equivalent of 34 copies of @entity8 - this particular government document will have a pretty hefty impact on the environment all by itself			0
it will take ten trees worth of paper to print just one copy of the report , which is part of the hybrid bill for the proposed @entity17 to @entity19 rail line			1
plans : the document will set out the noise and visual effects of phase one of @entity25 , from @entity17 to @entity19 , as well as its impact on businesses , farmers and traffic congestion ( file picture ) a hybrid bill is a mixture of a public and private bill			1
this means the changes to the law it proposes would affect the general public , but would also have a significant impact on specific groups			0
because it is part of a bill , the environmental statement has to be delivered to @entity43 as a hard copy – which , at more than half a ton , will weigh almost as much as a @entity46			1
the report will also have to be printed for every local authority along the @entity25 line			2
the @entity50 , however , does not agree with government protocol that all bills must be printed , and is urging commons authorities to allow it to deliver the statement in electronic format			1
last night a spokesman said discussions were ongoing , but that the decision may require a @entity60 vote			0
taking the train : meanwhile a report has claimed that the number of @entity65 rail passengers travelling long distance will increase to 239million by 2020 , compared with 169million in 2011 the document will set out the noise and visual effects of phase one of @entity25 , from @entity17 to @entity19 , as well as its impact on businesses , farmers and traffic congestion			1
a report has claimed that the number of @entity65 rail passengers travelling long distance will increase to 239million by 2020 , compared with 169million in 2011			2
this is the biggest growth across @entity78 – but the @entity65 will still trail @entity79 and @entity80 in the number of passengers who will be travelling at high speed on these journeys , according to the report from technology company @entity86			2
a similar document will be produced later in the year for phase two of the line , which will go north from @entity19 along two branches , stopping at cities including @entity92 and @entity93			1
the @entity94 is set to face further criticism over the controversial @entity25 scheme because it is speeding up legislation			0
a so - called paving bill will be introduced after the @entity99 in may , to authorise ministers to spend about £ 150million on the project before it gains full parliamentary approval			0
the money will fund design work on the line and the trains , as well as ecological surveys			0
sources said the move was intended to demonstrate the government was ‘ cracking on ’ with the scheme .			0
