by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:46 am on 13th december 2011 @entity3 jails are to charge inmates up to $ 142 per night to stay there in an attempt to balance their budgets			1
those incarcerated in @entity9 , @entity10 , will have to pay for their bed and board under the means tested initiative , the largest so far in @entity3			1
officials have become outraged after watching wealthy celebrities like @entity18 sent to jail at taxpayers ’ expense			1
if you do the crime , prepare to do the time ... and the dime : those incarcerated in @entity9 , @entity10 , will have to pay for their bed and board under the means tested initiative they say the fee - which is not far off the $ 188 for a luxury hotel in the area - is needed to plug an $ 80million black hole in the county finances			1
@entity9 prison supervisor @entity37 said : ‘ you do the crime , you will serve the time , and now you will also pay the dime ’			2
he estimates that some 25 per cent of the county ’s prisoners could be able to to pay something and that it could earn around £ 4million each year			2
critics have however said it is unlikely to bring in even that much as most prisoners have no cash at all			0
mr @entity37 said that he put forward the law , which was unanimously passed by the county board of supervisors , due to concerns about overcrowding			0
@entity9 , which is east of @entity50 , has five jails and stands at 93 per cent capacity , up from 85 per cent in october			0
the price of crime : in the @entity55 to house a male category c prisoner costs £ 28,673 per year , or £ 78.55 per night the fee will reimburse the county for of clothing , health care and food			0
one issue of concern is that those who stay in county jails do so for an average of two years , meaning for a wealthy prisoner they could end up paying $ 51,885 per year , or $ 103,795 for their entire stay			1
mr @entity37 said : ‘ we need to be looking for revenue wherever we can for ourselves			0
‘ there are people who have the means and who get into trouble with the law			1
why should the citizens of this county with other struggles be forced to pay for that ? the @entity84 of the world can certainly pay for it themselves			0
’ in @entity55 , the cost of holding an inmate in jail can be even higher than in @entity9			2
keeping somebody in a police cell - which is done when there is no room at nearby prisons - is a staggering £ 459 per night			2
to house a male category @entity95 costs £ 28,673 per year , or £ 78.55 per night .			0
