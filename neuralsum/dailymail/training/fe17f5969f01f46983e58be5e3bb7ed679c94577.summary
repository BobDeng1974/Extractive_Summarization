by @entity0 high court judge mrs justice @entity1 told the couple to settle their differences over a cup of tea - and they managed it , which she described as ' pleasing ' a mother and father waged war for 10 years over their twin boys until a despairing judge ordered them to sort it out over a ‘ nice cup of tea ’			1
during their bitter decade of conflict , the former couple had endured 24 court appearances arguing over custody of the children			1
but the family judge ’s simple suggestion brought miraculous results , with the parents now seeing eye - to - eye and sharing contact with their sons			1
mrs @entity1 told the @entity36 yesterday : ‘ i suggested that , when the boys were dropped off and picked up , each parent should be made welcome in the home of the other , invited to sit down around the kitchen table and offered a cup of tea			1
‘ pleasingly , very pleasingly , against the background of the last 10 years , each parent reacted positively to that idea and it ’s been good for the boys			0
’ she added : ‘ the father , impressively , has taken the trouble to provide supplies of a particular health - giving drink for the mother , and i ’m sure the mother has been responding with similar thoughtfulness when he ’s called in at her home			0
’ it was even suggested they might now graduate to seeing each other over dinner , leaving other members of their families ‘ gobsmacked ’ at the outbreak of peace			2
the protracted battle began not long after the twins were born prematurely 12 years ago			1
they weighed just three pounds each and needed to spend the first eight weeks of their lives in hospital			0
even though their parents were described as ‘ very respectable ’ and in a long - term relationship , it put ‘ enormous pressure ’ on them , the court heard			1
when the little boys came home , they were extremely weak and the mother was ‘ intensely protective of them ’			0
the father ‘ felt excluded ’ and the parents ’ relationship crumbled under the strain			1
they split up before the twins reached their first birthday , and spent the next decade at war in the family courts			0
when the mother and father - who have not been named - arrived for their umpteenth court hearing , the weary judge observed : ‘ my sense was that i could have been doing little more than applying a sticking plaster to a deep and persistently infected wound			2
’ but , after the father described everyone in the family as ‘ exhausted ’ by the never - ending legal war , the judge made her cup of tea suggestion and sense began to prevail			1
during their bitter decade of conflict , the former couple had endured 24 court appearances arguing over custody of the children , but mrs justice @entity1 told the @entity36 they had reacted to her advice positively both mother and father , ‘ to their very great credit ’ , made concessions and agreed to build bridges			1
the mother began to appreciate the father ’s point of view , and he agreed it was impossible for him to say that she had ‘ poisoned ’ the children against him			2
the mother had ‘ felt under attack ’ by her ex-partner and her sense that he was constantly ‘ dragging her to court ’ had become ‘ almost too much for her to bear ’ , however , she had now come to recognise the importance of the father ’s role in her boys ’ lives			0
after hot drinks warmed hearts around the kitchen table , the ‘ quiet , respectful , polite and exceptionally well behaved ’ 12 - year - old boys wrote moving thank - you letters to the judge and came to @entity145 to meet her in her chambers			2
the judge said : ‘ if there was one thing the parents seemingly failed to do for all of the years they were in dispute , it was that they did not consider the impact upon the other - and the children themselves - of their actions			1
’ the judge added : ‘ i am hopeful , very hopeful , that for the future similar mistakes will not be made			0
there is very little which frightens children more than an absence of appropriate parental guidance and firm boundaries about the things in life that matter most			0
’ the boys will now spend alternate weekends with each parent - who have both found new partners - and contact over school holidays and half terms will be shared more or less equally			2
mrs @entity1 concluded : ‘ the details will be worked out by the parents			2
they welcome without hesitation the firm message that this is a final order , that there is no need for any further court involvement and that any return to litigation would be a profoundly retrograde step			0
‘ thus , they are empowered to make the arrangements , whatever they might amount to , work			0
‘ it has been a privilege to participate in this most satisfactory of collaborative efforts			0
