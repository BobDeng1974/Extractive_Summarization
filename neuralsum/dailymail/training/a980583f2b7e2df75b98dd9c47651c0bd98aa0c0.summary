@entity7 was 16 when he was jailed for beating a homeless man to death
released early from sentence for manslaughter of @entity11 @entity9
after breaching the terms of his licence he was returned to prison
the 21 - year - old carried out a burglary *shortly* after being released for second time
but he was not sent back and instead was handed a community order
now he has broken the terms of the order by missing an appointment with probation officers
however , a judge has allowed him to remain free as it was a single breach
the *decision* has *sparked* anger among residents in @entity12 , @entity13
