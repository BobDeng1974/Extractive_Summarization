by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 23 april 2013 a collection of motoring memorabilia saved from the skip and restored to its former glory is set to make its owner a millionaire			1
@entity7 has spent the past 40 years amassing hundreds of classic petrol pumps , enamel signs , rare petrol globes and motorbikes			1
many of the 800 items have been salvaged from skips and rubbish dumps for free before being painstakingly restored by the devoted 72 - year - old			1
golden age : @entity19 @entity18 with a lovingly preserved @entity21 motorbike , one of the centrepieces of @entity7 's £ 1million motoring memorabilia collection @entity26 era : the collection includes more than 30 petrol pumps , some up to nine foot tall and worth £ 5,000 mr @entity7 used to run a @entity30 - listed 1920s filling station at @entity31 in @entity32 , and displayed many of the items inside it			1
but his collection grew so big he opened up a small museum in an adjoining building in 2004 to house his memorial to motoring			2
mr @entity7 has now decided to part with the collection which could fetch up to £ 1million when it goes under the hammer			1
he ran the traditional filling station , which is not included in the auction , from 1982 until 2001			0
built to last : classic motoring signs are valued between £ 50 - £ 200 @entity45 : the artefacts are housed in mr @entity7 's @entity48 museum light traffic : classic illuminated motoring signs are much sought - after and can attract prices of £ 500 - £ 1000 rescued : much of the collection was destined for the scrap heap before mr @entity7 rescued it the entire collection , which includes some classic and rare vehicles , is worth £ 1million the garage was used by @entity58 in the late 1920s and has featured in episodes of @entity60 and @entity61			1
mr @entity7 said : ' in the early 70s i bought a run - down old @entity64 tractor for five pounds and that 's what really got me into collecting anything to do with motoring			1
' a lot of the items were collected just because people were throwing them out , so i 'd take them off their hands			0
labour of love : the collection was amassed over 40 years ' when i bought the filling station in 1982 i got rid of the tractors but i kept adding to my collection of motoring memorabilia			1
' he added : ' @entity81 got round that i was collecting motoring things and people would phone me up to see if i wanted what they were getting rid of			2
' i did n't always want the stuff but i thought it was a shame to throw it away			0
i 've built it up into quite a special collection			2
' included in the collection are more than 30 petrol pumps , some up to 9ft tall and worth £ 5,000 , 300 enamel signs of varying sizes and values and small lapel badges worth around £ 20			2
three motorbikes are up for auction including a genuine 1951 @entity21 bike used by the @entity21 , which is expected to fetch upwards of £ 10,000			2
the majority of the artefacts were collected from within a few miles of the @entity102			0
mr @entity7 , who prior to running the filling station owned a nightclub , added : ' there are a lot of nostalgic items and some beautiful artwork in the collection			1
' they 're not like the things you see at filling stations today - these things were built to last			0
' i love every last bit of the collection and it will be a wrench to see it go but it 's become too much for me to deal with			2
' now is the time to pass it on to someone else to enjoy			0
' i have n't thought about what i will do with the money - it 's more about clearing the decks			0
' @entity19 @entity18 said : ' mr @entity7 preserved the historic filling station and filled his museum with beautifully restored memorabilia			1
' he was always collecting and restoring things - he saved them for the nation			0
' the collection will be auctioned by @entity131 in @entity132 , @entity133 , on july 13			0
a @entity135 driver enjoys the fast disappearing luxury of a filling station attendant changes : the @entity102 in 1989 , virtually unchanged classic : the filling station today			0
it is grade ii - listed and was built in the 1920s			0

@entity7 has spent 40 years gathering motoring treasures
most were *hauled* out of rubbish dumps and restored to their former glory
he is now expected to make £ 1m from the sale of the collection
