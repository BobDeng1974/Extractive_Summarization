by @entity0 some women endure years of staggering and stumbling to master the art , while others ’ efforts simply fall flat			2
but help is afoot – with classes in how to wear high heels			0
clinician @entity8 is so fed up with treating women for joint pain caused by their favourite footwear that he has devised a course to teach them to walk properly in their shoes			1
clinician @entity8 said he is inundated with complaints from women suffering back and knee pain caused by their high heels walk this way : @entity8 , left , gives client @entity21 tips on how best to walk in her killer heels mr @entity8 , 40 , has been inundated with women complaining of back and knee pain triggered by the ‘ wonky ’ way they stand in high heels			1
he claims to have already helped hundreds by teaching them to use their leg muscles properly and ‘ fight ’ bad habits			1
and he warned that unless women learn to walk correctly in high heels , many more could end up with chronic joint problems			2
mr @entity8 , a clinical orthotist who works with doctors to make and fit braces and splints for patients , said : ‘ when i see girls who wear heels some of the most frequent problems related to them are weak knees and back pain			1
‘ i work with them to look at their physical strength and muscle tightness			0
‘ our legs are shock absorbers , so if we are n’t walking properly they are going to hurt			0
’ @entity8 is keen on changing women 's posture early on to avoid long - term damage mr @entity8 , of @entity55 , @entity56 , has introduced a ‘ perfectly poised ’ class which involves filming a client walking in heels and using the footage to analyse her walk			1
he examines each woman ’s gait and posture and gives her exercises to help strengthen any weak muscles and ease pain			2
for those hoping for a shortcut to painless strolling in stilettos , he warned there is no single approach that will suit everyone – but said he generally encourages his clients to stand straight and avoid slouching , which often involves tightening up leg and bottom muscles			1
@entity8 created ' perfectly poised ' after he was inundated with women complaining of back and knee pain mr @entity8 added : ‘ the difficulty is if a girl has never trained to improve their muscle control and suddenly jumps into a pair of heels			1
the body can not understand what has happened and she runs the risk of going head over heels like a newborn calf			0
’ but the good news is that he does n’t advocate women ditching their heels entirely			0
he said : ‘ from asking the girls they have all said that heels can give extra height and confidence			0
they said it is head - turning , dynamic and more powerful			0
‘ they just need to know how to walk in them properly			0
’ he said that unless women walk in high heels correctly they could end up with chronic joint problems which could take years to resolve			2
