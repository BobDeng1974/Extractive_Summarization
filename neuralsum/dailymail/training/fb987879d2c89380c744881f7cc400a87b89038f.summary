plans to make @entity1 a ' dry ' state have been blocked at the eleventh hour amid fears from tourism chiefs that overseas visitors will stop visiting the popular @entity8 state			1
@entity8 's top court has put on hold until the end of the month a move by the authorities to ban the sale and consumption of alcohol everywhere but in five star hotels			1
protests from bar owners and hoteliers about the devastating effect a ban could have on tourism has led the court postpone the government 's plans			1
disastrous consequences ? one tour operator says the level of bookings to @entity1 has noticeably dropped the proposals include shutting down bars and shops which sell alcohol and introducing ' alcohol - free days '			1
only luxury , five star hotels will be allowed to serve alcohol in a bid to tackle the state 's drinking problem			1
tour operators specialising in @entity1 holidays expressed relief that the plan has been temporarily shelved , but are concerned that the proposals are already affecting business			2
' it 's madness , ' says @entity47 , director of tour specialist @entity48 , of the government proposals			2
@entity50 , consultant at @entity51 , says he has already noticed a drop in enquiries for holidays in @entity1			0
' interest in holidays last year was tremendous but the last six or seven weeks i 've noticed much fewer calls and bookings , ' he said			0
' we 're only here for the beer ... ' or not , possibly ' if the ban goes ahead it will affect tourism on a huge scale			1
it will put small hotels out of business and the five star hotels will put their prices up even more , ' @entity50 says			2
' we are all fighting against it			0
' the number of foreign tourists visiting @entity1 jumped by 8 per cent last year to 858,143 , but @entity50 says this will fall drastically if the move goes ahead			0
' the government 's recent move to impose gradual prohibition in @entity1 is nothing short of madness in my view , ' @entity72 , a writer and well known cultural figure in @entity1 , wrote in an opinion piece about the proposals			2
@entity1 has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in @entity8 at more than eight litres per person annually			1
the government has announced it will shut more than 700 bars as well as some shops in a move towards total prohibition within the next ten years			0
in @entity8 , consumption of alcohol is already prohibited in the states of @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , as well as the union territory of @entity99			1
all other @entity8 states permit alcohol consumption although there is a fixed legal drinking age			1
holidaymakers were quick to admit they would think twice about booking a holiday to a ' dry ' destination			0
' when you 're on holiday , you want a cold beer , ' said @entity110 , 26			0
' i would think twice about booking a flight to a country where you ca n't have a drink when you want to			0
' but @entity47 believes that even if the ban is passed by the court at the end of september , there will be ways to get around it			1
' tourists will always be allowed to drink , ' he says			0
' and " special tea " will always be available			0
i 'm not unduly worried about it as i do n't believe it will be enforced religiously - off - licences will remain open			0
' @entity48 is one of many tour operators heading to @entity1 next week for the @entity128 ( @entity129 ) being held in @entity130 on september 18 - 20			2
' i fully expect the subject to be the main topic of conversation at @entity129 , ' said @entity48			0
alcohol contributes 22 per cent of @entity1 's revenue , and the state exchequer stands to lose 90bn rupees ( Â£ 897m ) if liquor is banned			2
courts in @entity1 will until september 30 be able to hear petitions from bar owners who say that the move to ban alcohol is discriminatory and affects their business .			1

@entity145 wants to ban the sale of alcohol everywhere but 5 *** hotels
tourism chiefs believe the proposals will damage tourism *irreparably*
@entity8 court has halted the ban until september 30
