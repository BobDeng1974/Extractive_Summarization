a woman who suffered from crippling endometriosis and was given an ultimatum to either lose weight or sacrifice her womb is now trying for a baby now she has lost 13st			1
doctors told @entity8 , 30 , that the only way to cure the ill health she had experienced since her teenage years was to lose weight through bariatric surgery , or undergo a full hysterectomy which would leave her infertile			1
after making the agonising decision to go under the knife , the symptoms of mrs @entity8 's endometriosis eased and she is now having ivf treatment in the hope of falling pregnant			1
' on the other hand , the symptoms of my endometriosis were getting steadily worse			1
my health was failing and i was so miserable because of the pain that i was having suicidal thoughts			0
' i told the doctors : " you 've got to do something , i ca n't go on like this "			2
' the choice was quite clear - either to have a hysterectomy and give up the chance of having children , or go for weight loss surgery , which i was told would make the symptoms easier to deal with			1
' i did n't know what weight loss surgery entailed but i knew i did n't want to give up the possibility of children			1
' mrs @entity8 , a nanny , was diagnosed with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome when she was 17 years old after years of pain , disrupted periods and weight gain			1
she said : ' my sister @entity56 , who is two years younger than me , is exactly the same in nearly every way but we looked so different			2
we ate the same food when we were children but whereas @entity56 could eat four burgers in one go and still stay a size six , i just put on more and more weight			1
' my periods were sporadic and always agonising			2
sometimes they lasted for six months at a time and then would disappear for a year			0
at one point i had a period which lasted a year and a half			0
@entity8 made the decision to undergo weight loss surgery when doctors told her her only other choice was to have a total hysterectomy ( pictured before her surgery left , and today right ) ' i had anaemia and an enormous amount of pain			1
it was depressing and lonely			0
i could n't get out of bed to do anything			0
the only thing i could do was go to the loo , and even that was next to impossible			0
' none of my other friends were bed - bound when they were on their periods			2
at 17 i knew i needed to see a doctor about it			2
' @entity8 ( left ) sister @entity56 would eat similar foods but @entity8 's condition meant she put on weight more easily due to a combination of the weight - gaining effects of polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis , and long periods of inactivity caused by the pain she experienced , mrs @entity8 saw her weight balloon to 26st 7lb by the time she was 25 years old			1
@entity8 , pictured with her nephew @entity105 , and niece @entity106 , always knew she wanted children one day she said : ' weight loss was n't my priority - there were so many other health problems i was contending with , and i knew that my personality was n't defined by my size			1
' i was told that the pain and other symptoms would be easier to manage if i lost weight , so i tried dieting and taking prescribed medication to stop the gain but nothing worked			1
' by january 2009 mrs @entity8 's pain was worse than ever and she was severely depressed			2
she said : ' i 'd become suicidal because there did n't seem to be a way out of the cycle of pain			0
i begged my doctor to do something			0
' she said i could either have weight loss surgery or have my womb removed completely			1
i had n't considered weight loss surgery for a moment			1
but then i did some research online and read case studies of women whose endometriosis had improved enormously after the surgery			1
@entity8 met her partner @entity137 , 23 , an ambulance technician , after her weight loss surgery ' i went back the next day and told the doctor that although i was nervous about it , i wanted to go ahead with it			1
' mrs @entity8 went under the knife in june that year			2
she said : ' i was so nervous the night before the surgery that i did n't sleep a wink			2
unfortunately , the procedure did n't go as planned			0
i could n't keep any food down after i was discharged from hospital so i went back in , and was told my body had rejected the procedure			2
' i stayed in hospital for six weeks , during which time i was very unwell , but i pulled through and i slowly got used to it			0
@entity8 , pictured on her wedding day , noticed her symptoms reduced almost as soon as she had lost weight @entity8 and @entity137 , pictured on their wedding day , have now started @entity159 in the hopes of starting a family ' once i 'd recovered , i realised that all the symptoms of my endometriosis had stopped completely			1
it was as if someone had flipped a switch			0
' i was over the moon when i realised i 'd made the right decision and i did n't need to worry about having a hysterectomy any longer			1
' three years after the procedure , mrs @entity8 had dropped down 13st , shrinking from a size 28 to a size 12			1
she met her partner @entity137 , 23 , an ambulance technician , who she would go on to marry in november 2013			0
the @entity173 explains : ' endometriosis is a common condition where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb ( the endometrium ) is found outside the womb			2
these pieces of tissue can be found in many different areas of the body , but they are most commonly found on the ovaries , on the lining of the pelvis behind the uterus and covering the top of the vagina			0
the condition is estimated to affect around two million women in the @entity193			1
most of them are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40			0
endometriosis is a long - term ( chronic ) condition that causes painful periods or heavy periods			2
it often also causes pain in the lower abdomen ( tummy ) , pelvis or lower back , as well as fertility problems			0
it may also contribute towards a lack of energy and depression			0
however , the symptoms of endometriosis can vary significantly and some women have few symptoms or no symptoms at all			1
you should see your gp if you have symptoms of endometriosis so they can try to identify a cause			2
' source : @entity223 she said : ' it was the perfect winter wedding - just as we 'd both dreamed of			0
i looked in the mirror and could n't believe how slim and pretty i looked in my wedding dress			0
it was a magical day			0
' shortly after the wedding , the couple turned their thoughts to having children via ivf and sperm donation			0
mrs @entity8 said : ' we could n't have funding for @entity159 on the @entity173 because there is no such facility to do so for same - sex couples in @entity27			1
i think the postcode lottery is very unfair , but we were determined enough to have the treatment privately			0
' unfortunately the first round of @entity159 led to the return of the endometriosis , so we 're waiting on some more consultations and tests before we can try again			1
but we 're never going to give up - having a family is our dream			0
' if it was n't for the weight loss surgery , i would have been forced to have the hysterectomy and we would n't even be able to consider it , so i have that to be thankful for			1
' mrs @entity8 is now hoping to raise awareness of endometriosis , a condition which affects as many as two million women in the @entity193			1
she has found support at the @entity261 group @entity260 , which has more than 2,200 members			0
she said : ' it 's very common but even close friends of mine do n't know exactly what it is			0
it should be talked about more openly because it affects so many lives			0
' to join the @entity260 group , search for ' @entity260 ' on @entity261 .			0
