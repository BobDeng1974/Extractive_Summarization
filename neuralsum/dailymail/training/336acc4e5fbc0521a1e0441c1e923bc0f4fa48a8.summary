@entity1 gov. @entity0 has closed the polling gap with former secretary of state and first lady @entity4 , after trailing her by 13 points a month ago			1
he now holds a 1 - point lead over mrs. @entity4 in a @entity9 poll released wednesday			0
that slim lead is within the margin of error , making the race a neck - and - neck affair for the first @entity15 polled @entity16 last month , @entity17 held a 49 per cent to 36 per cent lead over @entity0 , a seemingly insurmountable edge in what was admittedly a far - too - early public survey			1
but now all bets are off			0
gaining ground : @entity25 @entity1 gov. @entity0 won re-election last week , and his newfound national name - recognition is giving him a new edge in 2016 presidential matchups the results come as the @entity31 is falling apart of the seams , and even former president @entity17 is saying his fellow @entity33 , president @entity34 , should honor his promise to let insured @entity16 keep their health care plans			1
such a move would likely hobble the @entity31 system as upwards of 10 million fewer @entity16 would be forced to buy insurance in the public health care marketplaces			2
the university institute surveyed 2,545 registered voters nationwide between nov. 6 and nov. 11			0
an @entity45 poll released tuesday had @entity0 trailing @entity17 by 10 points , 44 per cent to 34 per cent , in a hypothetical 2016 matchup			2
but that poll sampled just 1,003 adults , and they were n't necessarily registered voters			0
more troublesome , @entity45 polled also sampled 8 per cent more democrats than @entity25			0
too big to fail ? @entity4 has a massive lead among other potential @entity51 presidential candidates , but @entity0 could be superwoman 's kryptonite the latest @entity57 poll also found that @entity59 congressional candidates have closed another crucial gap , matching @entity51 in what - if races for seats in the @entity63			1
thirty - nine percent of voters said they would vote for the @entity25 @entity63 candidate in their districts , the same number who would stand with @entity51			1
@entity51 held a 43 - 34 advantage on that score a month ago			0
there is little risk @entity25 will lose control of the @entity63 , but @entity51 have 20 seats to defend in the @entity75 next year , while @entity25 only have 13 incumbents up for re-election			1
combinations of state - level polls indicate that if the election were held today , @entity25 would pick up five seats , giving them 50 of the 100 @entity75 slots			0
democrats would still control the chamber , however , with 48 seats plus the two independents who caucus with them			0
@entity51 vice president @entity89 , as president of the @entity75 , casts tie - breaking votes			2
also - rans : @entity4 still holds commanding leads over @entity25 presidential hopefuls ( l - to - r ) sen. @entity94 of @entity95 , sen. @entity96 of @entity97 and rep. @entity98 of @entity99			1

@entity1 gov. @entity0 runs neck - and - neck with @entity4 for 2016 presidential votes after trailing her by 13 points in *october*
@entity17 still bests other @entity25 presidential hopefuls including @entity94 , @entity96 and @entity98
@entity0 earned massive new name recognition with his *landslide* re-election *victory* last week
@entity17 is *struggling* to distance herself from @entity31 as the health insurance *reform* bill *begins* to *disintegrate*
*generic* - ballot @entity25 @entity63 candidates are now tied with their @entity51 *opponents* in 2014 matchups
