1 @entity0 @entity11 ’s rear left wheel was shredding its tyre into a thousand pieces and his rivalry with @entity2 into a million tiny atoms of hatred			1
it was on the second lap of a bitter @entity20 @entity19 that the first cruel cut of the day was made : @entity2 was vying for the lead with @entity11 through @entity23 when his front wing punctured his team - mate			1
from first place , @entity11 limped back to the pits , rubber being thrown into the air as he went			1
@entity2 required a change of wing but was far less severely damaged , finishing second behind @entity0 and extending his lead in the drivers ’ standings to 29 points			1
watching the accident unfold , it seemed @entity2 was to blame			1
he was behind @entity11 and responsible for keeping himself out of the way			1
@entity2 hit me , ’ said @entity11 , registering his disgust at @entity2 ’s aggression			1
but the stewards did not intervene			2
they put it down as a racing incident			2
that was the majority interpretation of most seasoned observers and former drivers here during and immediately after the race			0
it was the version @entity2 stuck to in his every public utterance , even in an evening tweet			1
however , what had been seen as a clumsy bit of driving was given a more sinister edge by @entity11 ’s recollection of the post-race meeting between him , @entity2 , and team bosses @entity74 and @entity75			1
@entity11 ( inset ) claimed — and impeccable sources close to @entity3 concurred — that @entity2 told him he acted deliberately			1
catch me if you can : @entity0 in action during his @entity20 @entity19 win not for long : @entity11 leads @entity2 before the @entity3 pair collide speed : @entity84 began brightly and briefly led the charge as @entity86 and @entity0 followed ‘ he said he did it on purpose , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ he said he could have avoided it			0
he said he did it to prove a point			0
he said it was all my fault			0
’ @entity2 declined to comment on the accusation , maintaining in public that it was no more than a ‘ racing incident ’			1
there seems no doubt that @entity2 is willing to play dirty to win the world championship			2
in his defence , he believes @entity11 is too			2
@entity2 might even argue his deviousness is a direct response to @entity11 ’s previous disregard for the imperatives of teamwork			1
certainly , he was angry going into this weekend about @entity11 ’s failure to follow a team instruction at the last race in @entity110			2
the four - week summer break hardly acted as balm			0
the @entity113 , who refused to apologise for not giving way , alluded to this last night , saying : ‘ it was interesting because we had a meeting on thursday and @entity2 expressed how angry he was			2
i was thinking , “ it ’s been weeks you ’ve been lingering with this ”			0
he sat there and said how angry he was at @entity121 and @entity74			0
’ the animosity — the product of a suffocating internal fight for the title between two old karting buddies — has festered all season			0
coming together : @entity3 drivers @entity11 and @entity2 clash during the @entity20 @entity19 setback : @entity11 was forced off with a punctured tyre after this collision blow : the @entity3 driver collided with team - mate @entity2 during the early stages 1 @entity2 - 220 2 @entity11 - 191 3 @entity0 - 156 4 @entity86 - 121 5 @entity4 - 110 each complained the other had fiddled with his engine settings earlier in the season before the mystery and moaning at @entity141 , when @entity2 ran off the track during qualifying , something @entity11 believed was intended to hinder his final lap. so yesterday ’s incident was an accident waiting to happen			1
the headstrong @entity11 , with his tendency to brood on perceived slights , versus the calculating @entity2 , with the ice - cold ruthlessness he learned from three years as @entity153 ’s team - mate and a lifetime as @entity156 ’s son , was a combustible mix. with weak and inexperienced management , the likelihood of a self - destructive crash was greater			1
as @entity11 said after the race : ‘ it reminds me of when i was at school , the teachers will say something but they wo n’t do anything			2
’ hardly a grand prix weekend goes by when @entity3 do n’t leave the paddock promising to call a meeting and discuss how they go racing			0
to quote @entity174 , a five - time winner from 152 races during the sport ’s dangerous days of the 1970s , the men running the team are ‘ the three stooges ’ : @entity177 , the chairman , @entity75 , the executive director , and @entity74 , the technical boss			0
well , yes , @entity177 is a legend			0
but should he be walking around working for @entity182 media group @entity181 after a race ? would @entity184 act as a @entity186 pundit ? up and down : @entity2 leads the chasing pack during the first lap , but the @entity182 could only finish second as for @entity75 , he started his press conference by asking , albeit jovially : ‘ what did @entity177 say ? just so we are aligned … ’ it all feels a bit disjointed			2
@entity75 was meant to be in charge of the commercial side of the operation yet he seems to have elided into being the de facto team principal			0
nevertheless , @entity74 issues the most important instructions over the radio			0
there is not a central figure — a @entity202 — who calls the shots			0
the result , demonstrably , is that neither driver respects the instructions he is given			0
bubbles : @entity1 's technical chief @entity208 is soaked in champagne by @entity0 anger : @entity11 claimed he gave @entity2 space , so could n't ' understand ' what had happened cheers : @entity2 was frustrated that @entity3 did n't finish the day with a team one - two @entity215 wins as @entity2 hits @entity11 so @entity75 tried again last night to reassert his authority , saying : ‘ it ’s unacceptable			1
racing accidents can happen , racing accidents among team - mates should n’t happen , racing incidents between team - mates on lap two of a 44 - lap race with the dominant car should be a no , no , no , no , no. ’ he said the team would review their policy of not imposing team orders			0
ok , but rules only work if they are followed			0
yesterday , they were not			0
and the upshot of this fratricide ? @entity0 , driving supremely , is 64 points off @entity2			1
can the @entity236 , with three race wins already , creep to the title ? just a thought			2
