@entity0 has finally abolished slavery 148 years after the 13th amendment was first passed by the @entity3 - thanks to movie - goers at the @entity5			1
dr @entity6 , an associate professor of neurobiology and anatomical sciences at the @entity9 , saw the @entity12 - nominated @entity11 movie @entity13 in november			1
the movie left him wondering what happened next when each state voted on ratifying the amendment			1
he discovered that @entity0 was the only state that had not officially voted in favour of the change			1
a note on the @entity22 website said : ' @entity0 ratified the amendment in 1995 , but because the state never officially notified the @entity25 , the ratification is not official			1
mr @entity45 found out what paperwork was required from the @entity50 ' @entity49			1
the same weekend , mr @entity45 saw the movie for himself with his wife @entity53			2
he told the @entity54 : ' people stood up and applauded at the end of it			0
that â€™s the first time i ever saw an audience do that			0
' i felt very connected to the history			0
' mr @entity45 tracked down a copy of the 1995 resolution , which had passed the @entity3 and @entity65			1
it had been introduced by state senator @entity67 , who was upset when he learned his state had never ratified the 13th amendment			1
some lawmakers had abstained from the vote , but nobody voted against it			0
it is not known why the copy of the amendment was not sent in 1995			2
the film @entity13 prompted dr @entity6 to discuss @entity0 's ratification of the 13th amendment with colleague @entity45 , who got in touch with secretary of state @entity82 secretary of state @entity82 filed the paperwork on january 30 this year after being approached by mr @entity45			1
on february 7 , the director of the @entity86 wrote back			0
his letter said : ' with this action , the @entity0 has ratified the 13th amendment to the @entity22			0
' @entity82 told the @entity54 : ' it was long overdue			0
' @entity67 said : ' we finally got it right			0
' last week , @entity45 and mrs @entity92 and their daughters met @entity95 and posed for photographs with the documents for the state 's official ratification			1
the @entity101 , introduced under president @entity13 , states : ' neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the @entity31 , or any place subject to their jurisdiction			0
' before @entity0 corrected its oversight , the last state to ratify the amendment was @entity113 in 1976			2
the 13th amendment required 27 of the then - 36 states to give their approval after it had been passed by @entity35			2
the 27th state to vote in its favour was @entity120 in december 1865			2
at the time , @entity0 rejected the 13th amendment , alongside states such as @entity113 and @entity122 .			0

dr @entity6 *investigated* what happened after the film 's conclusion
