@entity0 has no intention of quitting as team principal of @entity3 despite being mired in legal controversy this week			1
@entity0 's position has been drawn into sharp focus after appearing to have signed three drivers for the new @entity9 season , but with naturally only two seats available			1
the case with reserve driver @entity12 is to continue at the @entity13 of @entity14 in @entity15 on saturday , just a few miles from the @entity17 circuit			2
@entity0 addresses the media in @entity15 on friday with her team mired in controversy @entity21 takes to the @entity17 track during the second practice session for the @entity25 @entity24 @entity0 , a trained lawyer , was naturally unable to shed any light on the case given it remains ongoing			1
but asked whether she was still competent to run the team , @entity0 replied : ' i do n't see it ( the case ) having any effect			1
' we have a very clear view of what we did			0
we took action after thinking about it for a while			0
' for us that was very clear , but the outcome is different , and that 's all i can say to you			0
' pressed on whether she had considered resigning , @entity0 added : ' i 've not considered that			2
@entity12 walks through the @entity3 team garage as his legal dispute with the team continues @entity46 in action for @entity48 as the champions continued where they left off by setting the pace ' this whole matter does not have any effect on the way we work , the way the team works			1
' @entity0 conceded , however , the past week had affected morale with the team 's name dragged through the courts			2
' it 's had a very negative impact on the team because the situation was , for a while , unclear , ' added @entity0			2
' we now have certain actions taken against the team , and we are acting accordingly			0
there 's nothing much more really i can say to that			0
' the @entity13 initially upheld a @entity74 arbitration panel decision that the team not deny @entity76 his right to drive given the 29 - year - old has a contract for a full - time seat for this season			2
@entity83 driver @entity82 was also in action for @entity3 under the blazing sun in @entity15 @entity86 is now pursuing enforcement of the order allowing him to drive , otherwise @entity3 risk being in contempt of court			0
at one stage during the day bailiffs were on stand - by outside the circuit ready to impound @entity3 's assets , namely the cars and trackside equipment			1
@entity3 's problem is they also signed @entity98 and @entity21 towards the end of last year before cancelling @entity100 der @entity12 's deal in february , according to @entity0			1
with three valid contracts and only two race seats available , @entity3 and @entity0 have found themselves mired in controversy @entity3 have been forced to detail their assets to the court , whilst the worst - case scenario for @entity0 is she faces imprisonment if she fails to comply with the order			1
the legal argument resulted in @entity3 failing to take to the track for the opening practice session of the year at @entity15 's @entity17			1
come @entity114 , with lawyers for both parties back in court at the same time , it was @entity118 and @entity21 behind the wheel , with @entity86 unable to acquire in time a super licence required to drive in @entity9			0
asked as to why they were unable to take part in @entity124 yet did so in @entity114 , she replied : ' it 's a topic which i can not talk about			0
that 's all i can say			0
