@entity0 , the @entity2 @entity1 terror group whose april kidnapping of nearly 300 young girls has united the civilized world in anger , promised to assassinate @entity9 ambassador to @entity11 @entity10 in february 2012 , vowing to murder him if @entity9 signed a terrorism - fighting @entity12 with the government in @entity15			1
@entity10 , now the @entity9 ambassador to @entity16 , was not harmed			2
but the threat , coming amid a years - long bombing campaign that killed more than 1,400 @entity11 civilians , did n't move then - secretary of state @entity20 to fast - track the addition of @entity0 to the @entity9 government 's official list of international terrorist groups			1
independent media outlets inside @entity11 first reported on february 9 , 2012 that an unnamed @entity0 leader issued a statement promising that ' we will murder the @entity9 ambassador if the mou is signed			1
' the revelation provides a stark parallel with assassination warnings issued by @entity1 groups in @entity34 , @entity35 in the months before the september 11 , 2012 attack that killed @entity9 ambassador @entity37 and three other @entity9 personnel			1
with dozens of military vehicles and heavy arms on display , the terrorists held what an intelligence analyst later said was ' a team pep rally before the game , only for jihad			0
' the @entity20 @entity69 infamously ignored that event , even though the first attack on @entity9 diplomatic facilities in @entity34 followed two days later – a bombing at the compound 's gate that left a hole big enough for 40 men to walk through			1
later requests for additional armed guards at the @entity34 station also fell on deaf ears			0
@entity54 ultimately returned to finish the job			0
a september 2013 report from the @entity9 @entity84 ominously speculated that @entity10 's fate in @entity11 could be the same as @entity37 ' in @entity35			1
' the danger that @entity0 may try a similar assault on diplomatic personnel there , as they [ @entity54 ] did in @entity35 , is a terrifying possibility			1
' then - @entity9 ambassador @entity10 , spoke at a mining and oil - production conference on feb. 8 , 2012 , the day before @entity0 threatened to assassinate him in retaliation for @entity9 cooperation with efforts to fight terror in @entity11 the threat against ambassador @entity10 's life in @entity11 had come three months before the @entity34 parades			1
' we have had him under surveillance for a while and if the mou is signed , we will carry out a premeditated attack on him , ' @entity0 had said in a separate statement , according to @entity11 media			2
' we know his house in @entity113 [ a northern district of @entity15 ] , we know his vehicle and the time he leaves his house and the time he returns			2
' @entity11 's civilian government , the group added at the time , would be making a grave mistake if it joined @entity9 in an ' unholy marriage ' to fight ' our men			1
' the @entity123 in @entity124 confirmed the report on february 10 , 2012 , adding that @entity0 had also threatened ' several suicide attacks on @entity9 targets ' as part of an ' international jihad			2
' it 's not clear why the @entity69 resisted adding @entity0 to its foreign terrorist organizations ( @entity133 ) list for so long			1
a former @entity69 official who served in a legal capacity under @entity20 told @entity136 on wednesday that one component of the decision was undeniably political			1
' bulking up the @entity133 list was not what anyone in leadership wanted , ' the former official said			0
' at some point it became as much about how things looked as what needed to happen			0
' the @entity148 administration added 17 such groups to the @entity133 list in eight years			0
@entity150 's @entity69 had added 11 by the time he stood for re-election in 2012			1
during the election season , the @entity34 attack threatened to simultaneously unravel both of @entity150 's foreign policy victories : the undoing of @entity55 through the death of @entity158 , and the promised stabilization of @entity35 following the overthrow of dictator @entity161 , both in 2011			1
bringing attention to the expansion of @entity1 terror in @entity11 , an important @entity9 trading partner , would have counted against @entity150 as he campaigned to keep his job , according to the former @entity69 official			1
' we all understood , as the @entity69 does today , that @entity55 is far from being defeated , ' he said			0
' but no one wants to say that in a swing state , right ? ' the @entity12 between the @entity9 and @entity11 was inked six months later , after @entity20 visited @entity15 personally on august 9 , 2012			1
in it the @entity9 offered @entity11 's government assistance ' in forensics and post-attack inspections , ' according to a @entity175 report , as well as help improving their methods of tracking and arresting militants – but no direct special - forces or other military assistance			2
@entity20 also proposed to help @entity11 security forces set up an ' intelligence fusion cell ' to professionalize the way they shared information , similar to how @entity9 military and law enforcement agencies routinely cooperate			2
@entity11 president @entity46 thanked @entity20 in 2012 for @entity9 's ' moral support ' and ' technical support ' during the 2010 elections that brought him to power , but did n’t address any @entity9 cooperation with his attempt to crack down on @entity0			1
when @entity20 arrived , the group was detonating a bomb nearly every day , racking up a death toll that approached 1,400 – mostly @entity197			0
but the @entity69 resisted adding @entity0 to its list of designated terror groups until @entity200 , @entity20 's successor , pulled the trigger in november 2013 that same month , @entity10 left his post in @entity11 for @entity16			1
just another day in @entity11 : @entity0 destroyed the @entity204 central market on may 5 , 2014 in the @entity206 district of @entity207 in the northeastern region of the country first lady @entity210 launched her bid at ' hashtag diplomacy ' after @entity0 terrorists kidnapped nearly 300 @entity11 girls in april @entity20 fought pressure to regard @entity0 as a threat to @entity9 interests throughout president @entity150 's first term , as it morphed from a @entity220 religious study group in 2002 into a hard - line regional @entity1 terror organization by mid- 2009			1
its militants bombed the @entity225 building in @entity15 in 2011 , bringing new terror - designation pleas from the @entity227 , the @entity228 , the @entity229 and more than a dozen members of @entity231			0
the @entity20 @entity69 did add three @entity0 leaders – as individuals – to its list of terrorists on june 21 , 2012			2
in a press briefing that day , then - @entity69 spokeswoman @entity236 told reporters that ' there is always this question of whether designating individuals within an organization is the most effective strategy or whether the designating the whole organization is the most effective strategy			0
so we ’re continuing to look at the question of a broader designation			0
' ' more broadly , ' she added , ' we are working with the government of @entity11 and encouraging it in its dialogue with forces in the north , to promote a unified , multi – pluralistic @entity11 where the rights of all people , no matter their religion , no matter where they live , are protected in its own security efforts , that it examine its tactics , it look more at policing , and that it begin a real dialogue about some of the roots of the dissatisfaction in the north , which are primarily economic			0
' more than a year later , on july 31 , 2013 , @entity69 spokeswoman @entity268 was asked for an update after @entity0 killed 45 people in a series of coordinated attacks			0
in a may 12 , 2014 video released by @entity0 , a man claiming to be its leader @entity273 said hundreds of missing @entity11 schoolgirls had converted to @entity220 and would not be released until the terror group 's militants were freed from @entity11 prisons ' can you comment on why @entity0 has n’t been designated as a foreign terrorist organization ? ' a reported asked , according to the briefing transcript			1
' i do n’t have anything for you on that , ' @entity268 replied			0
officially designating a foreign organization as a terror group allows the @entity9 to freeze bank assets belonging to the group and its members and add them to no - fly lists			2
it also permits @entity9 law - enforcement agencies to prioritize their resources toward fighting the organizations			0
' @entity0 ' is a loose translation of the @entity297 ' @entity299 education is sinful			0
' but that phrase is more of a nickname for the organization whose official moniker is ' @entity305 , ' or ' people committed to the propagation of the @entity309 's teachings and jihad			0
' the @entity150 administration has responded to the group 's april kidnappings , and to its threat to sell the captured girls into slavery if a prisoner swap is n't agreed to , with what detractors call ' hashtag diplomacy			0
' first lady @entity210 appeared in a photograph that quickly circled the globe , holding a placard reading ' # @entity324			0
' she followed with a saturday radio address expressing her outrage over @entity0 's kidnap spree , but never mentioning its status as a radical @entity220 sect , or the @entity11 - wide conflict between northern @entity332 and southern @entity197 that has fed its rise to power			2
the @entity9 @entity334 in @entity15 has issued repeated warnings about threats to @entity9 citizens in @entity11 , including some after the september 2012 @entity34 attack			1
intelligence analysts told @entity136 that @entity0 has been behind a long string of kidnappings since 2010 , mostly of @entity342 , and largely at the direction of @entity55 in the @entity344 ( @entity345 )			0
in january 2012 the @entity225 @entity346 reported that @entity0 had sent militants to train in @entity345 camps in @entity349 , and @entity351 's foreign minister said days later that there was credible intelligence the group had trained at @entity345 camps across @entity356 .			2

@entity0 vowed in february 2012 to assassinate ambassador @entity10 if the @entity9 helped @entity11 with terror - fighting efforts
' we know his house *...* we know his vehicle and the time he leaves his house and the time he returns , ' the group said in a *communique* to media
the warning was similar to @entity54 's pledge to kill @entity9 officials in @entity34 , @entity35 , three months before the deadly 2012 terror attack there
despite clear threats , @entity20 's @entity69 fought efforts to officially designate the mass - murdering @entity11 as a terrorist group
a former @entity69 official said naming new terror groups ' sent the *wrong* *message* ' about @entity55 and its allies as @entity150 ran for re-election
