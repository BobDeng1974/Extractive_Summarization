by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 never again can @entity2 be considered a part - time spinner , not now that ‘ the beard ’ will be well and truly feared after the perfect end to the complete test for @entity6 and captain @entity7			1
what a turnaround from the embarrassing last day at @entity10			0
what a performance from a man who found himself in the eye of a storm over his views on @entity16 before creating a storm that engulfed @entity19 ’s batsmen			0
@entity2 may be different to the stereotypical @entity21 sportsman but what is absolutely clear , after he took the last four of the six wickets to fall at the @entity25 on thursday in 22 balls , is that he is the rightful successor to @entity27			0
we should not get carried away just yet , not after a display in which @entity19 batted as badly in @entity53 as @entity6 did at @entity10 , but @entity2 is clearly better than @entity7 and coach @entity54 gave him credit for			2
the sight of @entity57 in the second @entity59 squad was evidence that @entity6 were still not convinced about @entity2 ’s bowling but @entity7 ’s declaration that he had ‘ never seen a bowler improve so quickly ’ showed that this proud @entity21 and proud @entity64 will be underestimated no longer			2
while @entity6 were expected to wrap up a priceless third test victory , they could never have imagined it would be all over 10 minutes before lunch , with @entity69 and @entity70 both giving @entity7 a celebratory hug			1
it was @entity69 , back to his absolute best with the ball swinging throughout in @entity53 , who settled any @entity21 nerves by striking with his third ball of the morning and setting the tone with a spell of two for 11 in six overs			2
then it was over to @entity2 , who is learning his art under the spin master @entity84 at @entity86 and who just needs more bowling now to develop his variations and the ‘ doosra ’ that has rarely been spotted in this series			0
the fact that @entity19 ’s tail has been so strong in this series means that none of @entity2 ’s victims should be under - valued , with the possible exception of hapless debutant @entity99 , who looks a glorious throwback to the days of true @entity101			2
three of @entity2 ’s four wickets were clean bowled , with the other coming when @entity35 edged to gully just after @entity7 had placed @entity69 there for that very dismissal			1
putting up a fight : @entity108 plays some shots during @entity19 's second innings that is out : @entity108 is bowled by @entity2 as @entity69 celebrates during day five spin king : @entity2 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity108 it was that sort of @entity115 , who has come through the most searching examination of his character here , with as many as seven former @entity6 captains calling for his head after the team ’s winless run had stretched to 10 games			1
@entity7 has not exactly turned into @entity124 overnight but it was always likely that his decision - making would become better once he had scored runs to unclutter his mind and once his team had started performing to their potential			0
one swallow does not make a summer and @entity6 will need to back this display up with another good one at @entity133 , starting next thursday , but their first @entity59 win for fully 353 days will ease the pressure on a new team still finding its feet			2
the giant cloud still hanging over @entity6 is today ’s disciplinary hearing against @entity69 and there is no question that his absence would leave a mighty hole in the attack if he is suspended by judicial commissioner @entity145			1
@entity19 ’s determination to see @entity69 , who has irked them with his sledging , banished from the rest of the series is very strong while @entity6 are adamant that his brush with @entity108 has created a fuss over nothing			1
as @entity19 usually get their way in world cricket — as evidenced by them being allowed to appeal @entity108 ’s fine when no appeal process is permitted for @entity160 offences — @entity6 might have to prepare for the worst in @entity161			0
neither @entity162 nor @entity163 took a wicket in this match and @entity166 will surely return on an @entity133 pitch that is expected to be the quickest and bounciest of this @entity169 series			0
both @entity7 and @entity69 were quick to point out that @entity163 bowled well without luck but @entity162 had a shocker and it will be interesting to see whether @entity6 keep faith with him at a ground where he thrived in a one - day international against @entity174 earlier this season			1
jumping for joy : @entity69 celebrates as he takes the wicket of @entity178 all square : @entity69 helped @entity6 make it 1 - 1 in the series nearly there : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity183 celebrate @entity184 ( not pictured ) takes another wicket for now that dilemma can wait , with @entity2 — who now has 15 wickets in this series — @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity183 , who was superb with both bat and gloves on debut , all celebrating their first win in test cricket			1
it says everything about @entity6 ’s performance that @entity7 , @entity2 , @entity190 , @entity183 and @entity200 could have been man of the match ahead of @entity69 , who was back to his best for the first time since propelling @entity6 to victory in the first @entity59 at @entity208 last year			1
he now has 371 victims , 13 wickets away from overtaking sir @entity211 and becoming the leading wicket - taker in @entity6 ’s @entity59 history			1
what an age ago that @entity208 triumph , and subsequent @entity59 wins at @entity10 and @entity216 , seems			0
how spectacular and unexpected has been @entity6 ’s decline since			0
but they have stopped the rot and , suddenly , everything appears to have clicked into place for the new regime			0
the test for them now will be maintaining it .			0

@entity6 spinner @entity225 takes six second innings wickets
hosts win the test by 266 runs to level series at 1 - 1 with two to play
@entity69 took two wickets on day five to help @entity6 to victory
