it was another entertaining weekend in the @entity1 with 36 goals scored across the nine games			1
eight of those goals came at @entity6 ’s as @entity7 thrashed @entity8 , while @entity9 scored all four for @entity10 as they beat @entity11 4 - 1			1
there was plenty of late drama as well as @entity15 rescued a point for @entity17 against @entity18 in stoppage time			1
while across @entity21 at @entity22 there were four goals between the 87th minute and 95th minute as @entity24 edged out @entity25 3 - 2			1
@entity27 ’s reporters look back on the weekend and give their favourite moment from a memorable round of games			2
@entity31 everything @entity32 does seems to go ' boom '			2
until saturday , he was restricting his goals this season to screaming shots for club and country , but that header at @entity41 ; twisting , moving away from goal and then thudding it from the centre of his head was terrific			2
there were many crazy moments from this weekend , but allow me to enjoy fourth place and a @entity52 forward who looks a real menace			2
and that 's before we mention his free - scoring mate , @entity56			1
bring on @entity10 next week , @entity59 … you have been warned			1
@entity32 celebrates scoring @entity52 's second goal in their 3 - 1 win at @entity41 @entity62 after all the melodrama of ' @entity65 ' it did make me chuckle to see @entity67 skipping free like a teenager in the 95th minute of @entity24 's game against @entity25 to set up the winning goal			1
making no judgements on @entity72 vs @entity73 but most of us would love to be as ' burnt out ' as @entity78 football 's quickest 19 - year - old			2
@entity67 came through a difficult week by putting in a good performance for @entity24 at @entity25 @entity81 - @entity80 over the past month or so @entity82 has increasingly muttered about referees			1
the frustration has been rising , with his perception that @entity86 do n't get a fair shake from officials has intensified			2
on sunday , he blew his top			2
he will likely be charged by the @entity91 for his outburst against @entity93 , having already been patronised by @entity94			2
but his rawness is what appeals			0
he says what he thinks			0
at some point , with fines and such like , that will be chiselled out of him			0
but for now it is nice to hear honest thoughts from a manager			0
@entity82 blew his top at the penalty awarded to @entity105 after @entity106 ( right ) appeared to dive @entity108 seeing @entity109 come up with new and imaginative ways to keep themselves in the news			0
last week , having proudly installed a giant led screen inside the stadium , the club declared that its arrival would enhance the match day experience for all fans			0
well , if they meant it would afford them an extra hour in the pub then they were right			0
the canvas around their jazzy new screen became dislodged in the wind before the game , delaying kick - off to 4pm amid safety concerns			1
but owner @entity130 – for once – missed a trick			0
for while the eyes of the world were on the canvas as it flapped in the breeze , not a single sports direct ad appeared on the screen next to it ! the new big screen at @entity141 became dislodged and delayed kick by one hour @entity143 an early flight to @entity145 on sunday means i missed the drama at @entity22 but watching @entity149 's press conference on @entity150 on sunday night was priceless			1
you can see clearly see the workings of @entity149 's mind as he is telling himself : ' do n't slag off @entity154 … do n't say it … whatever you do , do not say that thing about him being a fat waste of space … '			0
oops … too late … he said it … @entity149 hit out at @entity154 's lack of fitness during his post-match press conference @entity163 switching on the tv at 4.45pm and seeing @entity165 saying ' yes ! that is eight ! ' as he tried to explain @entity8 's capitulation at @entity7			1
such one - sided scorelines are associated with different eras , so when one comes along as it did at the weekend , it genuinely makes you do a double take if you have been oblivious to what has been happening minute - by - minute			1
the result was capped by that magnificent own goal from @entity178			0
chaotic football at its best			0
@entity7 's 8 - 0 win over @entity7 grabbed the headlines on saturday @entity183 a moment of pathos rather than joy : the look on @entity149 's face after * that * @entity190 own goal			1
after 56 years in the game , it still hurts just as much and it still matters			0
on one hand that gives me hope that your passion for the game can still be alive after so long			0
alternatively , i despair - it never gets any better , no matter how long you watch the game			2
@entity190 's own goal was the decider in the five goal thriller at @entity22 @entity204 loads of @entity17 ' fans ' were left gagging on their half - time prawn sandwiches when @entity208 scored a marvellous team goal within a minute of the restart			1
@entity18 's team of giants had beat the @entity213 at their own game : intricate passing , a sublime ball for @entity217 and @entity208 beating @entity17 's only ' big lad ' ( @entity218 ) in the air to score			1
i 'd mis - timed my visit to spend a penny but i did catch a brilliant exchange between two gooners still stood beneath a tv screen … ' is that live , @entity226 ? ' ' nah , we got this one in the bag , @entity229 ' @entity208 out jumped per @entity218 to score for @entity18 at the @entity230 @entity231 my team @entity11 lost on saturday but i was pleased to see @entity232 finally get a chance to start in the @entity1			1
yes , he missed a penalty but he set up the goal , won the penalty and brought more to the team than @entity239 has all season			2
some players need love and patience			0
@entity232 links up well with @entity244 , has a good footballing brain and suits the team 's style			2
now if they can just sort out that defence … @entity232 won ( and then missed ) a penalty for @entity11 in their defeat at @entity10 @entity253 @entity256 's free - kick was sublime but it was eclipsed by @entity258 's second at @entity259 : a slick and intricate passing sequence with @entity261 , bouncing passes off team - mates before applying a clinical finish			1
it was a sparkling gem amid a ruthless performance which left you wondering if this was the champions in action			0
and if this is another exceptional team being assembled by @entity270			2
@entity256 's goal for @entity258 from a free - kick was a thing of beauty as @entity270 's men won 2 - 1 @entity276 pleased with team 's evolution @entity279 the handshake between @entity281 and @entity149 at the final whistle at @entity22 said it all			1
@entity281 puffing his cheeks out and almost apologising			0
@entity149 shaking his head and muttering expletives in disbelief			0
the last eight minutes of @entity25 vs @entity24 summed up the chaotic brilliance of the @entity1			1
the handshake between @entity281 and @entity149 summed up the madness of the @entity1 @entity291 it 's probably cruel to highlight an own goal but @entity178 's spectacular effort was too funny			0
@entity295 scoring through his own net with all the skill of @entity298 while playing for @entity10 had for years been my favourite , but the way @entity178 struck the ball with such sweetness , and in no danger , nudges it top			1
@entity307 mention to @entity308 for his comically late dive to try to keep out @entity311 ' header			2
one for the cameras , perhaps			0
@entity308 looks dejected after he failed to keep out @entity311 ' header @entity313 i was fortunate enough to be at @entity6 's at the weekend where @entity178 scored what will surely go down as the own goal of the season			1
@entity7 and @entity8 fans were momentarily stunned into silence when the defender struck a peach of a first - time volley from the edge of the box – unfortunately for @entity178 it was past his own goalkeeper @entity326			1
it 's unlikely he has ever made a sweeter connection with a ball dropping from the sky			0
the fact i am picking that ahead of the eight goal annihilation of @entity8 , is testament to how good ( or bad ) @entity178 's volley was			1
@entity178 ( centre ) scored a stunning own goal as @entity8 were thrashed 8 - 0 at @entity7 @entity338 @entity270 labelled @entity258 's second goal at @entity340 as ' scandalous ' – it really was a thing of pure beauty			1
seventeen passes from one end of @entity259 to the other , with eight different players involved and nine touches by the eventual goalscorer @entity261			1
during a game that had almost descended into a training match , the change of pace and urgency of the @entity351 was frightening			0
fabregas gave @entity355 the eyes to finish , too			0
@entity261 rounded off an excellent team move to score his first @entity1 goal for @entity258 @entity360 the fact that @entity93 gave a penalty against @entity363 for wrestling down @entity364 in the area			1
' but if you give that , you 'll have six penalties a match , ' the apologists bleat			0
so be it , if there are six penalties a game those grappling matches at corners will soon stop			0
and maybe instead of grabbing opponents , defenders will actually , you know , defend corners			0
@entity363 ( right ) was correctly penalised for grappling with @entity364 in the area			0

@entity7 were the highest scores of the weekend with their 8 - 0 thrashing of @entity8
@entity9 scored four goals for @entity10 against @entity11
there were four late goals at @entity22 as @entity24 beat @entity25 3 - 2
@entity256 scored a stunning free - kick and @entity261 rounded off an excellent team move as @entity258 beat @entity340 2 - 1
