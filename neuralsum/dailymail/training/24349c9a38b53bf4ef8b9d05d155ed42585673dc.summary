in a radical shake - up of care for the nation ’s four million over- 75s , the health secretary also promised telephone consultations day and night			1
he said he was ripping up the controversial contract @entity13 struck with gps in 2004 because it ‘ broke ’ the direct link between patient and practitioner			1
writing on this page , the health secretary says a new contract will make sure elderly patients have a ‘ strong , personal and regular relationship with their gp ’			1
the gp will know their medical history and circumstances ‘ just like the old family doctor knew everyone on their patch ’			1
the reforms are expected to ease the huge pressures on casualty units			2
a third of emergency admissions are for over- 75s and most of these could have been avoided with better primary care			2
mr @entity1 added : ‘ @entity13 did terrible damage to out - of - hours care			1
putting that right will take time			0
' but this government has a plan to do it			0
today we take a step forward			0
’ crucially , over- 75s who want advice or reassurance will be guaranteed a same - day telephone consultation			2
surgeries will be responsible for ensuring patients can get through at all hours of the day or night , with many expected to run a shift system staffed with doctors and practice nurses			0
those that choose to contract out the service will be responsible for its quality – and subject to an inspection regime modelled on @entity64 ’s oversight of schools			2
round the clock care : in a radical shake - up of care for the nation ¿ s four million over- 75s , the health secretary also promised telephone consultations day and night the health secretary has created a new ‘ chief inspector of @entity14 ’ who he says will come down hard on surgeries that fail to provide a good service			1
mr @entity1 says this means that even if a gp is not on call at weekends or evenings ‘ the buck stops ’ with them : ‘ this is about fixing the long - term pressures on our @entity85 services , and improving care for those with the greatest need			2
’ under a deal agreed with doctors ’ leaders yesterday , @entity14 ’ new responsibilities will take effect from april			1
as well as offering patients same - day telephone consultations , they will have to coordinate care for elderly patients discharged from @entity85 and regularly review emergency admissions from care homes to avoid unnecessary call - outs in future			1
paramedics , @entity85 doctors and care homes will have a dedicated telephone line run by a gp practice so they can advise on treatment			1
this avoids the need for a patient admitted to hospital having to undergo a barrage of unnecessary tests because their medical history is unknown			2
future hopes : mr @entity1 says he hopes a similar service will eventually be offered to millions more patients , such as children or those with long - term conditions mr @entity1 says he hopes a similar service will eventually be offered to millions more patients , such as children or those with long - term conditions			0
the trade - off for doctors is the scrapping of a series of ‘ tick box ’ targets they say hamper their professional judgment and waste their time			0
@entity13 allowed @entity14 to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours – and at weekends – as part of the botched deal that came into force in 2004			1
hitting back : @entity142 , @entity143 s health spokesman , said : ¿ no amount of spin can hide the fact that @entity147 has made it harder to get a gp appointment ' since then , private companies have taken over cover and in many cases have been forced to employ foreign doctors , often with little grasp of @entity155			1
the @entity156 has repeatedly highlighted the deterioration in the service since the contract was changed			2
the number of attendances at @entity85 has increased from 17.8million before the 2004 contract to 21.7million last year			1
ministers say the rise has been fuelled by the failure of doctors to provide a good service around the clock			2
@entity169 , chairman of the @entity171 ’s gp committee , said : ‘ the @entity171 has sought to positively engage with the government to address the difficult financial and workload pressures facing general practice in order to find new ways of improving patient care , while at the same time freeing up gps and practice nurses from pointless bureaucracy			1
‘ our agreement will deliver real benefit to patients and build on the work already carried out by @entity14			1
‘ this will not only free up @entity14 to spend more time focusing on treating patients , but will also mean that valuable resources will be reinvested in general practice to improve frontline care			1
’ the deal also means patients will be able to book appointments or repeat a prescription online			0
but @entity142 , @entity13 ’s health spokesman , said : ‘ no amount of spin can hide the fact that @entity147 has made it harder to get a @entity170 appointment			1
' there is nothing in this new contract to correct that			2
‘ @entity147 cut @entity13 ’s scheme of evening and weekend opening and the guarantee of seeing a doctor within 48 hours			1
‘ this announcement will not put an end to patients phoning the surgery at 9am and finding it impossible to get an appointment many of whom , not happy with a phone consultation , will still turn to @entity85			0
’ taking a step forward : the @entity156 is right to criticise @entity143 s 2004 gp contract			1
it broke the personal link between gp and patient , writes @entity1 the @entity156 is right to criticise @entity13 ’s 2004 gp contract			1
it broke the personal link between gp and patient			1
it piled target after target on doctors – and many of these targets were useless and distorted clinical priorities			0
over the past ten years , gps have been de-professionalised – robbed of the right to make their own judgments and prevented from looking after their patients in the way they know best			0
@entity13 ’s 2004 contract also took responsibility for out - of - hours care away from @entity14			1
as a result , 90 per cent of @entity14 do not provide it			1
inevitably , many people feel they have no choice when they want medical attention but to go to accident and emergency			0
this puts huge pressure on our a&es , especially during winter			2
the government has a plan to sort this out			0
today , we are ripping up @entity13 ’s old gp contract			1
a new contract has been agreed			2
@entity13 may have destroyed the family doctor , but this government will bring them back			1
this is about fixing the long - term pressures on our @entity85 services , and giving elderly people the care and dignity they deserve			0
our priority has been the over- 75s			0
this is because around two thirds of over- 75s are living with a long - term condition such as diabetes , asthma , or dementia			0
this can lead to preventable problems in @entity85			0
one third of @entity85 visits are from over- 75s , for example			0
many of these would be avoided if there was proper gp care in the evenings and weekends			2
@entity85 staff do n’t always know their underlying conditions or circumstances , or even where to discharge them to			0
cutting queues : it is hoped the shake up will ease pressure on @entity287 - a third of admissions are aged over 75 that is the problem we have to solve			1
our new @entity14 contract will make sure that @entity294 ’s over- 75s have a strong , personal and regular relationship with their gp			1
their gp will know them , and their conditions and circumstances – just like the old family doctor knew everyone on their patch			2
but we also need to plan for the longer term			0
this is why sir @entity305 ’s review of urgent and emergency care is so important			0
in fact it chimes with much of what the @entity156 has been calling for			0
sir @entity305 wants to see a fundamental shift in provision of urgent care			0
important : @entity314 medical director professor sir @entity305 's review of emergency care is much needed , according to @entity1 he has called for more extensive services outside hospital ( which will help reduce @entity85 queues ) and for patients with life - threatening or serious conditions to be treated in centres with the best clinical teams , expertise and equipment			2
we know that certain conditions are better treated in fewer , more expert centres			0
for example , being treated in a stroke specialist centre reduces the chance of people dying			0
quite rightly , sir @entity305 says this approach will give people peace of mind : knowing the @entity314 will be there for them when they need it			0
i know @entity156 readers want that for their families			0
so do i. along with the biggest reforms to the gp contract since 2004 , this government has a plan to invest £ 3.8billion in integrating health and care , to stop patients falling between the gaps			1
when elderly people have to go to hospital , there will now be quicker arrangements for their discharge – meaning more beds are free – and better arrangements when they come back , meaning fewer re-admissions			0
to help @entity85 doctors , paramedics and care homes know more about elderly patients when they are unwell , @entity14 will – with proper consent – share medical records			1
and they will be at the end of a dedicated telephone line for out - of - hours care			2
better communication will be underpinned by a locally - led it revolution			0
this will mean the @entity314 can be paperless by 2018			0
and it will contrast with the billions of pounds wasted by @entity13 on a top - down system that was a disastrous failure			1
the @entity156 is absolutely right that @entity13 did terrible damage to out - of - hours care			1
putting that right will take time			0
but this government has a plan to do it			0
today we take a step forward .			0

the health secretary also promised telephone consultations round the clock
he said @entity13 's 2004 contract with @entity14 ' broke ' link between patient and gp
it is hoped that the radical shake up will ease the pressure on @entity287
