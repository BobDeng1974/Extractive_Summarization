for most women , being eight and a half months pregnant means taking it easy , sitting back and hoping that @entity2 will put in an appearance before too long			2
the 35 - year - old bodybuilder from @entity8 has sparked an online storm after posting photos of herself lifting heavy weights on @entity12 - with her due date just two weeks away			1
@entity15 's photo has already had more than 16,000 comments posted beneath it since it first appeared on 15 september - and the feedback has been very mixed			1
' this is actually sickening , ' wrote @entity35			2
' i hope pregnant [ women ] around the world do not do this kind of cr * *			2
' i am a crossfit enthusiast but i do not recommend this at all			2
doctors always strongly suggest to not lift heavy because you can sever your placenta and cause major damage an early labour and miscarriage ...			2
' posting this picture goes people the wrong message that this is okay when it 's not ! ! ! ! ' another , @entity52 , wrote : ' cross fit ? this goes way beyond a way of life , and right into an obsession			1
' she is very selfish for endangering a life for her own personal gains and achievements			1
this is not a proud picture to post			2
controversial : @entity6 - @entity25 's decision to continue weightlifting caused outrage among some commenters unrepentant : @entity25 took to @entity12 to answer her critics and thank supporters for their ' love ' ' that amount of weight lifted above the head is extremely dangerous while pregnant			1
cross fit is a hobby , not a necessity to life			2
it 's becoming unconscious to the dangers of reality			0
' others sprang to her defence , with @entity84 writing : ' you go girl ! looking great ! ! ! much better than a lot of obese pregnant ladies with high blood pressure and diabetes who get short of breath walking up a flight of steps			0
' @entity95 also took to facebook herself , commenting : ' i want to thank everyone for their kind and supportive responses ! ' haters will hate and it 's ok			0
my life is not their life thank goodness ! lol ! again , thank you ! it means so much to feel this much love from a community i adore			0
' her comments echo previous remarks made on her profile page on the website @entity116			0
on it , @entity95 , who also has a son aged eight and a daughter aged 12 , says : ' i have always loved athletics and fitness			1
hot mama : @entity25 has declared her intention to be a ' hot mom ' and plans to continue with her workouts @entity126 from the @entity127 said : ' she 's quite far along in her pregnancy so there ca n't really be any problem with it , and if she 's always done weightlifting i do n't think it would suddenly bring on early labour			1
' obviously we are n't advising pregnant women to take up weightlifting if they 've never done it before , but if she 's used to the exercise it 's ok			0
' we always say if women were riding bikes or going to the gym before they were pregnant they can continue to do so , they just need to tell their instructor they are pregnant and then they can adjust the exercises			0
' i understand why people might be concerned , but if the woman does n't want to stop doing her exercise that 's fine			0
' ' after the birth of my second child , i knew i needed to step it up big time ! i loved being a @entity152 but i wanted to be a hot mom			0
' this is just the beginning for me and i assure you there are big things to come for this @entity152			0
' @entity95 is n't the only workout loving mother - to - be to make headlines after her pregnancy regime came to light			1
four years ago @entity165 fitness enthusiast @entity163 hit the front pages after being pictured lifting 15kg dumbbells with just 11 days to go before her due date			1
another mother criticised for continuing a tough fitness regime throughout her pregnancy was model @entity172 who was stunned at the backlash she received after competing in a gruelling marathon while 20 weeks pregnant			1
speaking to @entity176 after the marathon in november last year , @entity172 said : ' when i tell people i 'm still exercising , they react as if i 've told them i 've been smoking or drinking alcohol while pregnant			0
' but what i 'm doing is actually good for me and my baby			0
' @entity172 's belief that fitness aids labour is backed up by studies that have found that babiesof women who exercise are better off when it comes to their birth because ' foetuses of exercising women may tolerate labour better than those of non-exercisers , ' according to the @entity194 ( @entity194 )			1
along with official @entity196 guidelines that recommend 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day for expectant mothers , the @entity194 also advocate exercise where there are no complications in the pregnancy and precautions are taken such as not exercising at a high intensity to raise the heart rate to its maximum and not running while it 's too hot due to a risk of overheating			1
they state : ' in most cases , exercise is safe for both mother and fetus during pregnancy and women should therefore be encouraged to initiate or continue exercise to derive the health benefitsassociated with such activities			1
' mixed response : @entity25 posted her photographs on the @entity12 page and was met with both support and anger they add that it 's a fallacy that exercise increases the risk of miscarriage or damage to an unborn baby stating ' women should be advised that adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes are not increased for exercising women			1
' they explain that exercising while pregnant has numerous benefits for the mother 's health and wellbeing : ' maternal benefits appear to be both physical and psychological in nature			0
many common complaints of pregnancy , including fatigue , varicosities and swelling of extremities , are reduced in women who exercise			2
' additionally , active women experience less insomnia , stress , anxiety and depression			0
' women who exercise while pregnant will also gain less excess weight , lowering the health risks associated with obesity .			0
