the mantra meditation , which involves repeating a sound repeatedly twice daily for up to 20 minutes , lowers death rates from heart attack and strokes			1
the relaxation technique was used by patients with heart disease during a nine year £ 2.25million trial at the @entity20			1
professor of medicine @entity21 said : ' these findings are the strongest documented effects yet produced by a mind - body intervention on cardiovascular disease			1
' the effect is as large or larger than major categories of drug treatment for cardiovascular disease			1
' however , subjects were already taking standard medications and this effect was on top of that			1
' it followed 201 @entity38 men and women with an average age of 59 who suffered from the narrowing of arteries in their hearts			2
they were selected to do the @entity45 or to participate in a control group which received health education classes in traditional risk factors , including dietary modification and exercise			2
professor @entity21 said : ' in @entity38 men and women with heart disease , @entity5 , a technique for stress reduction , decreased the likelihood of mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction , and non-fatal stroke by 47 per cent			1
@entity5 was made popular by the @entity6 during the flower power era of the 1960s ' at the same time , study participants remained on their usual medications for cardiovascular disease risk factors , including anti-hypertensive agents and lipid - lowering medications			1
' consequently , meditation should be considered an adjunct , not a substitute , for usual medical care			2
although provocative , these observations should be confirmed in other patient populations			2
' the researchers did further analysis of two subgroups , those participants who had high compliance with the meditation program , and a high stress group , and found even greater reductions in death , infarction and stroke in those groups			2
the high compliance subgroup showed a 66 per cent reduction , while the high stress subgroup showed a 64 per cent reduction			0
