her biological mother @entity9 is @entity10 and was unmarried when she got pregnant and gave birth to @entity12 - since then she has worked closely with a @entity14 couple hopeful of adopting her daughter			1
but when @entity12 's biological father , @entity17 , found out he secured custody based on his @entity20 ancestry and the couple who looked after the girl from birth until 19 months ago were forced to hand her over			1
@entity17 pictured with his daughter @entity12 on monday			0
she is set to be returned to her adoptive parents yesterday it was revealed that @entity9 is suing the federal government , saying a law governing the placement of @entity31 children is unconstitutional			1
in her lawsuit , filed wednesday in federal court in @entity5 , @entity9 asks @entity35 attorney general @entity34 for a declaration that parts of the @entity38 are illegal			0
those measures – which include a preference for ' other @entity31 families ' over prospective @entity14 adoptive parents – should be nixed because the law uses race in determining with whom a child should live and therefore violates equal protection provisions , @entity39 argues			2
the act was passed in 1978 to reduce the number of @entity31 children being removed from their homes by public and private agencies and placed with @entity14 families			1
@entity54 and @entity55 were in the delivery room when @entity12 was born in @entity57 in 2009 the law , @entity39 said in the lawsuit , was enacted with good intentions but ended up ' sweeping within it children who do not have , and would not have – but for @entity38 – any connection whatsoever to any @entity64 other than biology ... and irrespective of whether their sole custodial birth mothers – their only legal parents – have even a trace of @entity31 blood			1
' @entity39 's lawsuit includes 10 unnamed plaintiffs who are also unmarried mothers of children of @entity31 heritage who , because of the federal law , fear the adoptions of their children wo n't be finalized because the prospective parents are non-indians , according to court documents			1
@entity39 's lawsuit also names the @entity20 as a defendant			0
spokeswomen for both the nation and the federal government did not immediately comment on the lawsuit			0
native american tribes across the @entity35 see the case as a test of tribal sovereignty which could set a precedent for other adoptions @entity12 , her biological father @entity17 , feed their geese and ducks at his home in @entity57 where she has lived for the past 19 months in the middle : @entity12 has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life ' i 'm always going to be her daddy ' : @entity17 and daughter @entity12 met for the first time on @entity104 2011 a @entity106 - area couple has been trying to adopt @entity39 's daughter since the girl 's birth			1
@entity12 lived with @entity54 and @entity55 for the first two years of her life but has been with her biological father since 2011 , when the @entity112 ruled that , because of the federal law , @entity17 should have preference because of his @entity8 heritage			2
a member of the @entity20 , @entity17 had never met his daughter and , after the girl 's @entity14 mother rebuffed his marriage proposal , played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the girl was born			2
but when @entity17 found out @entity12 was going to be adopted , he objected and said the law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions			2
the @entity128 appealed that decision to the @entity35 @entity112 , which ruled this year that federal law did not actually require that @entity12 be given back to her @entity8 father			0
but the ruling did n't directly award the girl to the @entity128 , instead leaving it to @entity5 courts to decide where @entity12 should end up			0
last week , the state @entity112 ordered a family court to finalize the @entity128 ' adoption of the girl , a decision that court upheld wednesday			0
no formal transition timetable has been set			0
@entity17 is also pursuing custody of her in @entity57 , and his parents also are seeking guardianship through the @entity8 court system several @entity31 groups have said they plan to file their own federal lawsuit to protect @entity12 's interests .			1
