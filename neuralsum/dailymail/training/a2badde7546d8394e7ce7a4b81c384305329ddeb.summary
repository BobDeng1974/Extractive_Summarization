by @entity0 published : 15:29 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 02:10 est , 31 may 2013 researchers have discovered that an unassuming 5,000 year old ancient @entity3 artefact hides an incredible secret - it was made from a meteorite			1
it is an important find as it explains how ancient @entity3 obtained iron millennia before the earliest evidence of iron smelting in the region , something that has confounded scientists until now			1
it also unearths a tantalising glimpse of the genesis of the ancient @entity3 ' religion and the divine attributes they attached to meteorites			1
' the sky was very important to the ancient @entity3 , ' says @entity19 , an egyptologist at the @entity20 , @entity21 , and a co-author of the paper on the discovery			2
' something that falls from the sky is going to be considered as a gift from the gods			0
' @entity29 - sent : the iron bead that unlocked the mystery surrounding the presence of iron among the ancient @entity3			1
it also poses exciting questions about the way the cosmos influenced their religion the evidence comes from strings of iron beads which were excavated in 1911 at the @entity43 cemetery , a burial site approximately 70km south of @entity46			0
dating from 3350 to 3600 bc , thousands of years before @entity3 ’s @entity48 , the bead analysed was originally assumed to be from a meteorite owing to its composition of nickel - rich iron			1
but this hypothesis was challenged in the 1980s when academics proposed that much of the early worldwide examples of iron use originally thought to be of meteorite - origin were actually early smelting attempts			2
to settle the argument , @entity58 , a meteorite scientist at the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity21 , and her colleagues used scanning electron microscopy and computed tomography to analyse one of the beads , which they borrowed from the museum			0
they found areas where the weathered surface had fallen away , providing what @entity58 describes as ' little windows ' to the preserved metal beneath , reports nature			0
the iron beads contained a unique ' fingerprint ' that shows they are from a meteorite the nickel content of this original metal was found to be high , suggesting that it did indeed come from a meteorite			2
the researcher also observed that the metal had a distinctive crystalline structure called a @entity90 pattern			0
this structure is found only in iron meteorites that cooled extremely slowly inside their parent asteroids as the @entity95 was forming			2
@entity96 , professor of @entity97 at the @entity20 , added : ' meteorites have a unique microstructural and chemical fingerprint because they cooled incredibly slowly as they travelled through space			0
it was really interesting to find that fingerprint turn up in @entity3 artefacts			0
' divine : the ancient @entity3 would have seen a meteorite as an offering from the gods ms @entity58 said the research highlights the application of modern technology to ancient materials not only to understand meteorites better but also to help us understand what ancient cultures considered these materials to be and the importance they placed upon them			1
' meteorite iron had profound implications for the ancient @entity3 , both in their perception of the iron in the context of its celestial origin and in early metallurgy attempts			1
dr @entity19 added : ' today , we see iron first and foremost as a practical , rather dull metal			0
to the ancient @entity3 , however , it was a rare and beautiful material which , as it fell from the sky , surely had some magical / religious properties			1
' they therefore used this remarkable metal to create small objects of beauty and religious significance which were so important to them that they chose to include them in their graves			0

@entity144 found to be made from meteorite *fragment*
@entity147 *solves* mystery of why @entity3 had iron so early
meteorites may also have shaped the ancient *people* *'s* religious *beliefs*
