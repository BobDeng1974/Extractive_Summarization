by @entity0 there have been some incredible own goals down the years but @entity3 may well have topped the lot of them on the opening weekend of the @entity7 season			1
@entity8 and his team - mates looked in visable shock after the midfielder planted a sensational 25 - yard volley into the top corner of the net , as a result giving opposition side @entity16 the lead			2
the @entity20 midfielder looked a little dazy and confused after the goal , but one thing that was for certain is that it was one of , if not the sweetest strike the 27 - year - old has hit during his career			1
blunder : @entity8 ca n't believe what 's occurred after his attempted clearance flies into his own goal uh-oh : @entity16 players celebrate the bizarre goal which gave them a 2 - 1 lead in the game clinical : @entity37 fires in an unstoppable drive ... into the wrong goal what made it all the more bizarre was that it appeared @entity16 had lost possession and @entity44 were in no danger of conceding , before @entity8 quite literally had a moment of madness			1
luckily for @entity8 his blushes were saved after a last - gasp equaliser from @entity44 ensured a share of the spoils			0
however , this will be one moment the @entity20 will never forget , and one world football wo n't either , with this surely already set to be the best own goal of the 2014 - 2015 season , unless something even more spectacular occurs			0
video @entity59 scores @entity61 against @entity62 elsewhere , @entity64 defender @entity63 also put the ball into his own net this weekend , and although not in as dramatic circumstances as @entity8 's , it was still fairly bizarre considering the fact he tried to blame his goalkeeper for the goal afterwards ! and that despite clearly heading the ball too high over the on - rushing keeper ! to compound misery the @entity74 side ended up losing 3 - 1 to their @entity77 opponents , @entity78 , in the friendly game			0
not the best day at the office for @entity63 - that 's for sure			0

@entity3 , a midfielder for @entity7 *outfit* @entity44 , scored the *extraordinary* own goal on the opening weekend of the new season
the goal put opposition team @entity16 2 - 1 up in the game
the 27 - year - old *arrowed* his attempted clearance from just outside the area spectacularly into the top corner
