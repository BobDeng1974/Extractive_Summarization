it was the clash that finally lifted the threat of @entity3 ’s imperial ambitions from @entity4 and brought peace after decades of war			0
the @entity7 also marked a new era for @entity9 , freed from the yoke of @entity3 tyranny			1
but it seems that the @entity9 do n’t see it that way , even after 200 years			0
the defeat of @entity3 ’s army outside a @entity18 town by @entity19 , @entity20 and allies from @entity4 still appears to be something of a sore point			1
the victory by the @entity25 ( left ) in 1815 stopped dictator @entity3 's ( right ) conquest of @entity4 , and sent the emperor into exile for the second and final time			0
@entity30 is attempting to block the creation of a two @entity33 coin commemorating the 200th anniversary of the @entity7 @entity19 's £ 5 coin that has been issued to mark the bicentenary of the @entity7 in an extraordinary intervention , @entity9 has blocked plans for a two euro coin to commemorate @entity25 ’s 1815 victory over @entity3			1
president @entity41 claimed the @entity18 project would be a ‘ symbol that is negative ’ and undermine eurozone unity			1
now the @entity18 have scrapped plans to have the commemorative coin produced next month to avoid a diplomatic row			2
@entity41 ’s government argued the battle was still a bad memory for the @entity9 people			1
a @entity52 source said : ‘ @entity18 have withdrawn the project because it would not be in their interest to cause upset to the @entity9			1
’ last night @entity19 politicians said @entity9 ’s reaction to the coin – and @entity18 ’s subsequent cave - in – was ‘ absurd ’			1
@entity60 , conservative mp for @entity61 , said : ‘ i know the euro is a useless currency but i did n’t know that the @entity9 still could not cope with the fact they were defeated			2
' it is absurd , i would have thought the @entity9 would have been quite keen to have got rid of an emperor			0
the @entity9 should grow up a bit			0
’ mp @entity70 added : ‘ it shows how thin skinned and small minded the @entity9 are , how desperate @entity41 is politically and how weak the @entity18 are			1
’ a draft design of the coin was submitted to the @entity77 by @entity18 in february this year			0
it was expected to go into production next month but @entity9 objected to the coin last week , claiming in a letter to the @entity82 that producing the coin would ‘ risk … engendering unfavourable reactions in @entity9 ’			1
a two @entity33 coin marking the 200th anniversary of the @entity7 , in which the @entity25 defeated @entity3 ( pictured ) , has been proposed by @entity18 , where the battle took place the @entity7 on june 18 , 1815 , stopped the advance of @entity3 and sent him into exile for a second and final time			1
in the one day of fighting there were around 55,000 either killed , wounded , or missing in action			0
however , the battle ushered in more than 50 years of peace			0
while the proposed design of the coin has not been revealed , it is understood to have featured a battle scene			0
the @entity19 has issued a £ 5 coin to mark the bicentenary			1
the @entity7 on june 18 , 1815 stopped the advance of @entity3 across @entity4 and sent the great @entity9 emperor into exile for a second and final time			2
@entity9 's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition , led by the @entity19 army under the command of the @entity25			2
the armies amassed near the town of @entity113 in modern - day @entity18 , not far from the border with @entity9 , and it was the @entity9 who made the first move around 11am			2
the two sides clashed for 10 hours , with the @entity19 fending off repeated attacks from the @entity9 , until @entity120 arrived at the head of a @entity123 army			2
this was the decisive intervention which finished @entity3 off , allowing @entity25 to counter-attack and forcing the @entity9 to surrender			0
the battle forced @entity3 from the throne of @entity9 , leading to his exile on @entity130 - but @entity25 later admitted it was ' the nearest - run thing you ever saw in your life '			0
despite the popular image of @entity113 as a heroic endeavour , it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed , with the @entity9 bearing the brunt of the losses .			0

@entity18 , where the *historic* battle took place , proposed the two @entity33 coin
but @entity9 government argues that @entity19 victory is a ' negative symbol '
letter to @entity152 adds that currency will *provoke* an ' unfavourable reaction '
@entity19 has issued £ 5 coin to mark the bicentenary of the @entity7
