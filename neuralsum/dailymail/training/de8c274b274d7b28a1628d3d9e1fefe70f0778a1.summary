and while many of us would be aghast at the prospect of having our photo taken upon waking up , these lions were happy to be caught on camera right after their snooze			1
these stunning pictures of lions were taken at the @entity11 , in @entity12			1
sleeping beauty and the beast : @entity15 and @entity16 laze at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity17 bed head : tiny - who is four feet high and eight foot long - is one of three brothers at the wildlife centre @entity23 gazes intently at passers - by at the centre : the carnivore has built up a reputation for his playful antics , with photographers flocking from all of the @entity30 to picture him i 'm ready for my close up : tiny the lion appears to wink at the camera as he whips his mane in the air the fierce - looking carnivores became the stars of a series of portraits for photographer @entity43 at the @entity11 , in @entity12			1
the animals turned out to be pussy cats when it came to having their picture taken , tossing their manes , preening and fixing the camera with a stare			1
@entity23 strutted around his enclosure , allowing the 37 - year - old photographer to capture these eye - catching pictures , before growing tired of the attention and settling down to snooze			1
mr @entity43 , from @entity56 , @entity57 , said : ' lions are known to spend around 20 hours a day doing nothing			1
' luckily i waited for my luck to turn and he surprised us all with his cat walk skills			0
' @entity23 - who is four feet high and eight foot long - is one of three brothers at the wildlife centre			2
because he 's worth it : tiny the lion whips his mane in a pose reminiscent of the famous @entity70 adverts got my eye on you : @entity23 took part in a real life cat walk - confidently posing for his portrait open wide : he might be called @entity77 , but the animal gave a huge roar as he prowled around his home in the foundation @entity58 can sleep for up to 20 hours a day - but @entity43 was lucky enough to capture some photographs of the animals wide awake he has built up a reputation for his playful antics , with photographers flocking from all of the @entity30 to picture him			0
amateur snapper @entity43 added : ' once one of the three brothers started patrolling around his favourite area , i knew my luck was in			0
' being close to a predator as big as @entity23 , who is unbelievably powerful was an amazing experience			0
' the trick for me was to remember to take pictures instead of just standing there in awe			0
' lions are mainly nocturnal and are reputed to sleep or rest for about 20 hours a day			2
because lions do not have a great deal of stamina , they can usually only run fast in short bursts , and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack			2
they use reduced visibility to target their prey - many kills take place using camouflage or at night .			0

lions at the @entity12 centre whip their hair and snooze for the camera
