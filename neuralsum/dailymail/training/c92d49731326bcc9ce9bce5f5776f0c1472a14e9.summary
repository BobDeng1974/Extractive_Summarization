former @entity1 president @entity0 has demanded an eroding of borders between major nation states on the continent an extraordinary call for @entity7 and @entity1 to unite as a single country at the new heart of @entity10 came yesterday from @entity0 , one of the key figures in the demise of the @entity13			1
the former solidarity trade union leader shocked his follow @entity1 by demanding an eroding of borders between major nation states on the continent			1
we need to expand economic and defence cooperation and other structures to make from the states of @entity1 and @entity7 one state of @entity10 , ' said the mustachioed @entity0 , 70 this month , who was a staunch opponent of @entity24 hegemony in @entity10 whose historic industrial action in the @entity27 shipyards ushered in a new era freedom and democracy			1
' we have gone so far in our technical advancements that we are no longer located in our own countries , ' he told @entity33 news agency @entity32			1
' there is a broadening of geographical structures , while the economy and democracy should also be altered			2
' he insisted that the uniting of his @entity1 homeland which its bitter wartime enemy @entity7 was not only possible but the logical conclusion of his own historic role in dismantling the @entity45			1
' the @entity7 have done us a lot more evil , and the relationship we have now is much better than that with @entity33			1
why ? , ' he asked			2
' because after the war , @entity7 fully confessed to all its dirty tricks			1
it ’s necessary to say once and for all who did something evil , full stop			2
until we do , the wound wo n’t heal			2
' the @entity56 president who won the @entity57 said : ' my struggle led to the reunification of @entity7 and the creation of the state of @entity10			1
' we destroyed the borders , globalisation is on the horizon			1
' the outspoken former politician said @entity7 ' fully confessed to all its dirty tricks ' after the war - including its concentration camps in @entity71 - so the pair could be united claiming the old borders no longer mattered , he said : ' this is the broadening of geographical structures , while the economy and democracy should also be altered			1
' of building new structures , he said : ' it ’s @entity80 bricks			2
' having faced down the might of one old empire - the @entity24 - he appeared ready in his rambling remarks to trust a new @entity85 and , further still , embraced an almost utopian vision of a world without frontiers			2
' tomorrow there will be no division to @entity10 and @entity91 , ' he said			0
' these are old concepts that would remain only on maps			0
@entity97 is a process of structures growing due to the technological progress			0
' right now we are stopped by obstacles of different kinds , like various kinds of disparities , different systems , but gradually we ’ll be smoothing it down and the states will become like @entity80 bricks			1
' if a state will have a good shape , it will be possible to build various kinds of structures			0
he insisted that the bitter wartime enemies should unite , despite the atrocities inflicted in @entity117 as ' globalisation is on the horizon ' ' the frontiers will not be visible			1
those who have bad parameters would not be able to unite with anyone			1
the shapes are freedom , democracy , free market , pluralism			0
' however , he seemed to question @entity33 ’s ability to join this new club despite recently urging closer relations with this former enemy			0
' we need to have similar shapes of those @entity80 bricks , ' he said			0
' if @entity33 gets the right shapes , it will be possible to work with it			0
' since @entity33 is a huge country , a rich country , it has the whole @entity142 table			0
everyone would want to work with it , but it has to have the right shapes so that it will be possible to build something with it			0
' @entity0 - who called himself ' a leader by nature ' - appeared to rule out a return to frontline politics			0
' i am too old already , ' he said			0
' ' this is one of @entity0 ’s exotic ideas , ' said ex-premier @entity155			0
' he has the role of someone who stimulates ideas , sometimes annoying ideas , but i do n’t attach much importance to this one			0
