@entity0 has been released from rehab			1
after checking into a facility on january 28 and stating that he wanted to ' be a better family member , friend and teammate , ' the @entity3 quarterback is out and ready to begin offseason workouts with the team , which begin on april 20			1
this as many are still wondering what future the highly touted athlete will have in the @entity12			0
now comes the real test however , as he will be forced to compete with @entity30 for the starting quarterback position , who just signed a $ 14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons			1
this after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts , @entity0 was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the @entity3 season last december , but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem			1
especially after one incident last year when , after partying until well past midnight , @entity0 , who is suffering from an injured hamstring , skipped out on a saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept , and in turn was fined by the @entity3			1
@entity0 was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior , saying ; ' it ’s about being accountable			2
instead of looking like a jackass			0
' and while his season may have been over at that time , many believed @entity0 would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy , which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at @entity62 at the @entity63 in @entity64 on over the @entity66 holiday , alongside the likes of @entity68 and @entity69 , and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend @entity72 and some buddies poolside at the @entity63			1
at this point , some in the sports world , chief among them columnist @entity74 , began to suggest that the @entity81 winner needed to get help for his drinking			1
the aqthlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released appearing on @entity25 ’s @entity86 , @entity74 , a noted supporter of @entity0 , did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking			2
' my concern , i repeatedly said , was if @entity0 continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol , and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails , then i ’m going to be out , ' said @entity74			2
' in talking to people in and around the @entity3 , i believe @entity0 continues to have a problem with alcohol			2
and i believe ... that it is time for @entity0 to get some help			0
he continues to lie to his executives , to his coaches , to his teammates , to the media , and most of all , he continues to lie to himself			0
' he then said he would label @entity0 an ' alcoholic			0
' @entity0 was known for his partying while at @entity110 , but said he was a changed man during the 2014 @entity111 , noting that he had ' grown up , ' before being selected 22nd overall by @entity3			1
just days into his training with the @entity3 however , the local press began calling him out on his partying , which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field			2
a source told @entity119 at the time ; ' @entity122 officials had bought into @entity0 's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat - boy lifestyle back in @entity126 , @entity127 , and they 've been stunned by his non-stop antics			1
' a photo snapped of @entity0 before the start of the season and later posted to @entity132 showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter @entity0 while the 2013 @entity81 as the quarterback of the @entity139 also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of @entity0 and later posted to @entity132 that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter , leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine			1
@entity3 head coach @entity147 spoke to @entity0 soon after the problematic photo was posted , a photo that could have led to an inquiry or a drug test from the @entity12 , and said he felt that things were back on track and that @entity0 was focused on football once again			2
there was also an odd incident during the regular season when he got into a fight with a fan in the lobby of his apartment building , and while alcohol seems to have played a role in the incident , it was the fan who was inebriated , not @entity0			0
it should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by @entity25 in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college , @entity0 did seek help for an alcohol problem , seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks			0
@entity0 would later claim this report was false , and that he had never seen a counselor for anger management or for alcohol abuse while in college			0
@entity0 is now set to begin offseason workouts with the @entity3 on april 20 as for his future with the @entity3 , that is a little unclear			1
some , including @entity25 's @entity182 , have called on the @entity3 to fire @entity0 after he overslept for his treatment last year , saying he and fellow player @entity184 have a ' complete lack of professionalism			1
' @entity184 was also out with @entity0 and showed up late for the team walk - through , an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season			2
currently , @entity0 has a four year contract with the @entity3 worth about $ 8.25 million			1
the 22 - year - old also has some of the most coveted , and lucrative , endorsement deals in the sports world with , among others , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , and @entity201			0
for now though , @entity0 seems to be committed to laying low and focusing on the football			0
' when [ @entity0 ] is back , it will be full speed ahead for him , said @entity147			0
' i think he 's very anxious at this point			0
we 'll be prepared as we will with every other player			0
when they get back to town , we 're going to coach the heck out of them			0

@entity0 has been released from rehab after entering a facility on january 28
