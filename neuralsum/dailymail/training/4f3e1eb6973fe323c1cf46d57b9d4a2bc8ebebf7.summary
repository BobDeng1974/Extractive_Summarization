as he crawls around and babbles his first words , @entity0 is an exhilarating bundle of joy			1
but , remarkably , he could easily have not been here – if he had weighed just an ounce less at birth			2
he was born prematurely at 23 weeks weighing 520g , just 0.7 of an ounce over the hospital ’s 500g cut - off point for intervention			1
bundle of joy : @entity0 pictured with his parents @entity14 , 30 , and @entity15 , 33 , at home in @entity17 , @entity18 tiny : born at 23 weeks - a week before the abortion cut - off limit - weighing a tiny 1lb 1oz , @entity0 was so small and unwell that his parents claim they were advised to turn off his life - support machine with severe health problems – including a bleed on the brain and a hole in his heart – @entity0 ’s chances seemed dire , and doctors warned there was a high chance of him suffering disabilities as a result			1
however , he defied predictions and has now celebrated his first birthday			2
the case will fuel the debate over guidelines governing whether hospitals try to save the lives of extremely premature babies			0
it will also raise fresh questions about abortion laws , which allow terminations up to 24 weeks			0
proud : a year on , @entity0 has no long - term health problems , his parents claim , calling him their ' miracle ' baby @entity0 : the case will fuel the debate over guidelines governing whether hospitals try to save the lives of extremely premature babies @entity0 ’s mother @entity52 , 30 , described her son as a ‘ little fighter ’ , adding : ‘ we know premature babies can make it			1
while the final decision of whether to help an extremely premature baby to survive is a decision primarily for doctors , in consultation with the parents , guidelines are set by the @entity63			1
these state : less than 23 weeks : ‘ it would be considered in the best interests of the baby , and standard practice , for resuscitation not to be carried out ’			1
23 weeks to 23 weeks and six days : ‘ if … the foetal heart is heard during labour , a professional experienced in resuscitation should be available to attend the birth ’			1
24 weeks to 24 weeks and six days : ‘ resuscitation should be commenced unless the parents and clinicians have considered that the baby will be born severely compromised ’			1
25 weeks and greater : ‘ it is appropriate to resuscitate babies at this gestation and , if the response is encouraging , to start intensive care ’			0
the @entity83 has also issued guidance , which covers interventions in the case of even more premature babies			0
it suggests : between 22 weeks and 22 weeks and six days : ‘ @entity89 practice should not be to resuscitate the baby ’			0
it should only be considered if the parents insist and ‘ the clinicians agree that it is in the baby ’s best interests ’			0
before 22 weeks : ‘ attempts to resuscitate should only take place within a clinical research study that has been assessed and approved by a research ethics committee ’			0
‘ if you say you will support a child that is 500g then what is the difference with one that is 495g ? i think abortions are morally wrong after 22 weeks			1
’ mrs @entity52 , from @entity17 in @entity18 , started experiencing complications with her pregnancy when her waters broke at 22 weeks			2
she and her husband @entity15 , 33 , a car designer for @entity113 , were told she would need bed rest in hospital to try and extend the pregnancy			0
doctors at @entity118 warned that her baby faced being stillborn unless he had more time to develop – but she went into labour just nine days later , on august 28 last year			2
@entity0 was unable to breathe for the first six minutes of his life as attempts were made to open his immature lungs			2
he was rushed to intensive care immediately – ending up spending 109 days in hospital			0
he had severe bleeding on both sides of the brain and [ doctors ] said it was worth thinking about whether we wanted to put @entity0 through all this , added mrs @entity52 , who is originally from @entity133			1
‘ i asked what they meant and they said there was a 99 per cent chance he would have cerebral palsy			0
he would be deaf and could be blind			0
’ but after ten weeks the bleeds had gone altogether , and by the time he left hospital he was overcoming the hole in his heart			0
now the only signs of his ordeal are that he is small for his age and short - sighted because of a condition associated with his long - term use of an oxygen machine			1
mr @entity0 added : ‘ we said that if he started fighting we would fight for him and that ’s what he did			2
’ a hospital spokesman said that medics had discussed the possibility of switching off @entity0 ’s life support simply to ‘ prepare ’ his parents in case he deteriorated			1
he added : ‘ there was no sense of “ giving up easily ”			0

@entity0 from @entity17 was born last *summer* weighing a tiny 1lb 1oz
at 23 weeks , this was a week before the legal cut - off *deadline* for abortions
doctors warned he would *n't* get any medical help if he weighed under 1lb
and *cautioned* if he did survive , he would have no *protection* from *infections*
parents say they were advised to turn off life - support *due* to bleed on brain
but they *refused* , and four *months* later they were able to take @entity0 home
has just celebrated his first birthday and has no ' long - term health problems '
