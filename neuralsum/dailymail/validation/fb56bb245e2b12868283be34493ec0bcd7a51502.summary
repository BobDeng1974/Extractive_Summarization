an @entity1 man who spent nearly 40 years behind bars for a murder he did not commit will receive $ 2million from the state as compensation for his wrongful imprisonment			1
@entity7 , 59 , and his friends @entity9 and @entity10 were sentenced to death in 1975 for the murder of a businessman after a 12 - year - old boy said he saw them commit the crime			1
all three men were exonerated in november after the witness , @entity18 , recanted his testimony last year and said he had been pressured and threatened by police to testify			2
the figure is computed from the state 's base rate for wrongful conviction compensation , which stands at $ 40,330 per year in jail			1
the number is then adjusted for inflation			0
in addition to the tax - free $ 2million award , @entity7 will also receive an undetermined sum of money to account for the wages he lost while in prison , according to his attorney @entity44			1
@entity45 said she believes the amount , which is decided by an expert , will be substantial as @entity7 has shown himself to be an ' incredibly talented and wise person ' since his release			2
' the career path he could have taken will be worked out by the expert , ' she told @entity30			0
' he could have gone in any number of directions			0
' @entity7 ( pictured left in his original mugshot and right in february ) is the longest - serving wrongfully convicted prisoner			2
his award was computed from the state 's base rate for wrongful conviction compensation @entity7 ( pictured here walking out of jail ) called the $ 2million compensation ' fantastic ' and said it was ' going to mean so much ' the @entity10 brothers are due to receive their initial checks soon as well according to @entity45 , who said their case was a couple of weeks behind with the state 's @entity69			1
@entity7 's payout is significantly smaller compared to recent wrongful conviction compensation awards			1
just yesterday an @entity74 man who spent nearly 20 years in jail after being wrongly imprisoned for rape and murder received a $ 20million settlement , setting a new national record			1
he received about a million dollars for each year spent behind bars			1
@entity7 , in comparison , received about $ 51,000			2
and in january a @entity83 man who spent 21 years in jail for a rape and murder he did not commit received $ 6million in compensation after dna tests proved his innocence			1
but @entity7 was rendered speechless and thankful when he heard about the $ 2million compensation , calling it ' fantastic '			2
' this is going to mean so much , ' he told @entity30 and no matter the amount of money , @entity7 and the @entity10 brothers all have ' scars that we are never going to be able to recover from , ' he recently told @entity98			1
but no matter the amount of money , @entity7 ( pictured here picking up his dry cleaning in february ) said he and the @entity10 brothers all have ' scars that we are never going to be able to recover from ' the three men were exonerated after original witness @entity18 recanted his testimony last year and said he had been pressured and threatened by police to testify when he was 12 years old ' i think the opportunity for justice to be served was lost the day we went to court , ' said @entity7 , who said he will never forget the fact that he does n't have kids			1
but @entity7 said he did not feel bitter or spiteful			2
' that 's something that happened			0
everyone is going through something in their life			0
' ' whatever we lost is gone ... we ca n't ever recapture it			0
' @entity7 was only 18 when he was convicted of the may 19 , 1975 , murder of @entity28 businessman @entity27 , who was attacked , robbed and shot to death			1
the @entity10 brothers and @entity7 had walked passed the crime scene and inquired what had happened			1
they became the prime suspects not long after			0
the @entity10 brothers are due to receive their initial checks soon , as their case is a couple of weeks behind @entity7 's with the state 's @entity69 the aftermath of the murder for which the @entity10 brothers and @entity7 were convicted in 1975 the prosecution 's case was based on the testimony of 12 - year - old @entity18 , who said he saw the murder			1
there was no physical evidence linking the three to the crime scene			0
all three men were given the death penalty , sentences that were commuted to life in prison after the @entity151 @entity150 outlawed capital punishment in 1978			0
their cases were first re-evaluated after a 2011 article in the @entity156 magazine highlighted @entity158 's unreliable testimony			0
in the initial court hearings , @entity18 said he was on a bus with other schoolchildren when he heard gunshots			0
other children on the bus have said @entity158 would not have been able to see anything from his seat , which he has since admitted was true			0
@entity7 said he holds no animosity toward @entity158			2
' it took a lot of courage to do what he did , ' he said			0
' he 's been carrying a burden around for 39 years , like we have			0
' ' but in the end , he came through , and i 'm grateful for that			0
