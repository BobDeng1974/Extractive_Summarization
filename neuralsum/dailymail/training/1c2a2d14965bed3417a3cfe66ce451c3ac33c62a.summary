for @entity3 , the greatest player in the history of the game is @entity4			1
‘ by a million miles the best i played with or against , ’ is the emphatic verdict			2
@entity8 ’s run to the final has jogged memories of @entity4 ’s magical influence on the 1986 and 1990 @entity12			1
it is here then , in the grand setting of @entity17 , where @entity18 must come to life if @entity8 are to win the @entity20 for a third time			1
‘ he is a god in @entity8 , understandably			1
he is a tough act to follow and has always been a huge personality			2
‘ his left foot could manipulate the ball as though it was a hand			2
’ despite @entity18 ’s standing within the game , he has looked subdued and isolated at times			1
in a workmanlike , industrious team , he is expected to turn games			0
he has scored four goals - including a special strike against @entity41 - but they have largely been forgotten in the final week of the tournament			1
@entity3 , who scored against @entity8 in the 1986 @entity20 , added : ‘ i love @entity18			1
he is the most wonderfully gifted player i have seen since @entity4 , but he looks jaded			1
let ’s see if he can do it in the final			2
‘ i ’ve watched him at @entity46 and there was less and less movement as the season progressed			0
i do n’t think he is in brilliant shape and he looks exhausted			0
to be honest i have been marginally disappointed with him - something is not right			2
’ scorer : @entity3 netted against @entity8 for @entity53 in the 1986 @entity20 quarter - final incredible : @entity4 inspired @entity8 to @entity20 glory in 1986 and to the final in 1990 @entity3 was unimpressed with @entity18 ’s work - rate during @entity8 ’s semi-final against @entity60			1
he added : ‘ i know in all the games teams have put players on him but he has done so little to create space for himself			0
every now and then he will light the place up , get the ball and beat three men but you have to wait a long time for that			0
‘ i have watched him for years and he scores a lot of poacher ’s goals , but on the occasions @entity8 did counter attack down the flanks , with @entity80 or @entity81 or whoever it was , he did n’t even try to get anywhere near the box			1
‘ i do n’t think in 120 minutes he touched the ball in the box			0
i saw a quote from his father saying he ’s exhausted and his legs weigh 100kgs			0
it looks a bit like that			0
’ @entity18 ’s goals got @entity8 out the group , but he has yet to control the tournament in the same way as @entity4			1
quadruple : @entity18 has scored four goals for @entity8 at this @entity20 but all were during the group stages more : former @entity53 international @entity29 wants and expects to see @entity18 control sunday 's final phenomenal : @entity4 ( right ) dominated the 1986 and 1990 @entity12 for @entity8 @entity3 added : ‘ they might have struggled to get through the group without some @entity18 magic			1
he got them through , in all ways			0
‘ then there was the brilliant bit of play for @entity114 to get the winner in the last 16 against @entity116			0
‘ he ’s been massively influential			0
they would n’t be where they are without him , or without @entity120 either			0
’ to prevent @entity121 winning their fourth @entity20 , @entity8 must restrain the midfield three of @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
the former @entity53 man said : ‘ the @entity121 - @entity129 game was the most amazing , remarkable match i have ever seen			1
the thing about them is that they are a team and they are very strong			0
trio : @entity121 's midfield three , which includes @entity124 , destroyed @entity129 during the semi-final stellar : @entity126 was also brilliant as @entity121 destroyed hosts @entity129 7 - 1 to reach the final brilliant : @entity125 excelled during @entity121 's semi-final demolition of @entity129 , scoring twice position : @entity121 's decision to shift @entity143 back to full - back has benefited the side unusual : @entity121 forward @entity146 has a unique style but is extremely effective @entity18 must reach new heights if @entity8 are to beat @entity121 in sunday 's @entity20 final ‘ @entity124 is important , @entity125 has had a lot of stick in @entity121 but he has come through			1
‘ i also like @entity146			0
he is a funny looking footballer , slightly ungainly , he falls over a bit and yet he sees things and he is a wonderful finisher			0
‘ the best thing that happened to them was shifting @entity143 to full back			0
i do n’t think he is a defensive midfielder - he is a bit ill - disciplined			2
they got away with it against the ( @entity162 ) @entity161 and @entity163			0
whereas @entity126 is not as a good a footballer as @entity143 , he is very good in the position			0
‘ their high line is the only risk , but @entity8 do n’t have runners in there			2
@entity120 is as good a holding player as you will ever see			2
his performance in the semi final was epic			2
’ @entity3 presents the @entity20 final on @entity175 at 7pm on sunday			1
deadly duo : @entity18 and @entity120 ( right ) have inspired @entity8 to the @entity20 final adored : @entity18 can be heralded alongside @entity4 if he inspires @entity8 to their third @entity20			1

@entity3 believes @entity4 is the best player he played with or against
@entity8 's run to @entity20 final is *reminiscent* of the @entity4 - inspired glory days of 1986 and 1990
@entity18 must come to life in the @entity187 if @entity8 are to win @entity20
he has scored four goals this tournament but none since the group stages
@entity4 took control of tournaments but @entity18 is yet to do that
@entity3 says @entity8 must *nullify* @entity121 's midfield to win
