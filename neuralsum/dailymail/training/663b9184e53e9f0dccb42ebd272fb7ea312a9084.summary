questions have been raised over whether @entity1 met secretly with the @entity3 intelligence committee as it investigated @entity5 torture questions have been raised over whether @entity1 made a secret visit to a @entity9 committee probing @entity5 torture , amid claims the government has been frantically ' lobbying ' to keep @entity12 out of the damning report			1
yesterday , @entity14 published details of how the home secretary was among politicians and diplomats who held meetings with the @entity3 intelligence committee , while it was investigating the barbaric techniques inflicted on terror suspects			1
the information about the meeting - said to be one of 23 involving @entity12 diplomats over the past six years - was released under freedom of information laws by the @entity27			1
but last night , the government issued an extraordinary clarification , stating it had made a ' clerical error ' and that mrs may had not met with the committee when it initially said she had			1
but , after the u-turn , officials admitted they could not confirm whether mrs may may have met leading members on subsequent visits in later years			1
in a statement released today , the @entity27 said : ‘ due to a clerical error , which we very much regret , the @entity27 ’s @entity40 response of 1 august on contacts with the @entity9 @entity3 select committee on intelligence referred to a meeting between the committee and the home secretary in july 2011			1
' that was a mistake : her planned visit in july 2011 did not take place and was postponed until september 2011			1
' on that reinstated visit in september 2011 , she did not meet the committee			2
’ as revealed yesterday , @entity58 , then foreign secretary , and spy agencies @entity56 and @entity57 were among a string of politicians and diplomats who held discussions with the committee about any redactions that might be needed to protect ‘ national security ’			1
in the end , there was not a single mention of any of the @entity12 security and intelligence services when the explosive document was published on tuesday			1
on thursday , in a surprise development , @entity73 changed its story over the talks with the committee			0
asked on wednesday about requested redactions , @entity79 ’s official spokesman said there had been ‘ none whatsoever , to my knowledge ’			0
but yesterday his deputy said : ‘ my understanding is that no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was @entity12 involvement in any alleged torture or rendition			2
' but i think there was a conversation with the agencies and their @entity9 counterparts on the executive summary			0
‘ any redactions sought there would have been on national security grounds in the way we might have done with any other report			1
’ the rest of list released by the @entity27 details how senior ministers and diplomats met members of the committee 23 times in six years – equivalent to once every three months			1
@entity58 , then foreign secretary ( left ) and @entity112 ( right ) were among those who attended meetings this remarkable access will raise fresh questions about the influence successive @entity12 governments tried to exert to ensure the country was not tainted by the revelations			1
it has fuelled concerns that the @entity12 pushed for key parts of the report referring to @entity125 , a @entity12 territory in the @entity127 leased to the @entity9 military , to be redacted			1
ministers have admitted that the island was a stopover for extraordinary rendition flights – in which terror suspects were moved to secret prisons around the world to be tortured			0
yet the summary of the heavily censored report , published this week , did not contain a single mention of @entity12 involvement			2
critics suspect topics for the talks included whether @entity12 involvement in or knowledge of @entity9 actions was mentioned			1
lord @entity112 , then the @entity146 security minister , met senators in october 2009			0
and sir @entity148 , ambassador to the @entity9 , and his predecessor sir @entity150 curried favour with the committee on 22 occasions			2
they met its chairman @entity155 six times			0
a cluster of meetings came as the committee took crucial decisions on how much of the report should be made public			0
the @entity12 has repeatedly denied complicity in the @entity5 ’s torture of @entity166 terror suspects			2
notably , two senators met by the @entity12 ambassadors denounced the report on tuesday			2
@entity170 and @entity171 both said it will put lives in danger			0
significantly , the @entity40 answer admits the list of talks is ‘ not exhaustive ’ and does not include ‘ brush - by meetings ’			0
@entity179 , of human rights group @entity180 , said : ‘ the huge number of meetings			0
suggests a determined lobbying effort			0
we know @entity12 was involved in the @entity5 ’s rendition programme , so it seems reasonable to assume these meetings focused on keeping embarrassing information about the @entity12 ’s role secret			2
‘ the government has serious questions to answer over whether it lobbied to keep its involvement in this shameful affair under wraps			0
’ mrs may will face close questioning about any discussions she had with senators on monday when she is due to appear before mps on the @entity202 home affairs committee			0
the @entity203 declined to comment last night .			0
