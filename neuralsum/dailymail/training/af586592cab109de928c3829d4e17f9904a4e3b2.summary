one player at @entity1 is understood to be earning more than £ 20,000 a week			1
that ’s a million a year plus change			2
and what does that buy the club nearest and dearest to my heart ? @entity1 are second bottom of @entity6 and in real danger of relegation to the fourth tier @entity18 's @entity1 side were beaten 4 - 1 by @entity19 last weekend at the @entity20 right now we are languishing next to bottom of the third tier of @entity25 football , with relegation to the bottom rung of the @entity28 looking more likely with every passing week			1
even though they sack managers almost as often as the team change their socks it would be harsh to blame @entity1 ’s new @entity35 owners			1
they have ploughed tens of millions into the club since taking over from @entity38 last summer			1
so what have @entity39 and his amici learned from this deflating experience thus far ? exactly what the occupants of that glittering ivory tower way above them , the @entity43 , keep discovering			2
that the more you pay the lesser the likelihood that your players will stay super-fit , obsessively focused and prepared to die with their boots on for very long at all			2
@entity53 star @entity52 passed the age of 30 but remains in prime physical condition it is a rare breed of young sportsmen who get filthy rich overnight yet are still hungry for success , year in year out			1
rather , once they have shot to fame and fortune they disappear up their own ego , then reappear in night clubs			1
for every @entity52 there are dozens of @entity67			1
as he turns 30 , @entity52 is in such prime physical condition that he looks as if he could carry on winning the @entity70 award for another five seasons			1
his insatiable desire to pile up more honours with @entity53 and to keep proving himself the best player on the planet – better even than @entity77 - supplies that urge to train like a demon , live right , eat healthy and eschew the vices			2
the @entity81 superstar is often one of the first to show up at the training ground @entity52 will not rest until he has given every last fibre to try and surpass @entity84 as the greatest of all time by his own manic admission , @entity52 will not rest until he has given every last fibre of his being trying to surpass @entity84 as the greatest footballer of all time			1
the advances in sports science – medical , dietary and a programmed lifestyle which allows for not only @entity94 exercise but repetitive skills practice – is raising the age barrier for the dedicated few			2
the birthday which @entity52 celebrated on thursday by sipping a nutritional drink used to be the watershed age for footballers			1
now several of the world ’s best are performing at the elite level well into their 30s			2
@entity77 is no slouch but one vital dimension in which @entity52 surpassed him to win the @entity107 last month is the physical			1
that takes single - minded commitment			2
sir @entity111 greets @entity52 at @entity112 in 2003 after signing him from @entity113 most of @entity52 ’s down time is devoted to rest and recovery , for which his home is filled with state - of - the - art equipment			1
when the majority of his @entity53 team - mates arrive for training they usually find him stretching and exercising in the gymnasium , not only to build strength but to ensure that his body is ready for the coming session on the pitch			0
real coach @entity130 reports : ‘ @entity52 is really pushing the boundaries			1
’ since much of this hard work is also designed to reduce the risk of injury it is not inconceivable that @entity52 could still be near his peak 10 years from now , as he approaches his 40th birthday			1
former @entity138 manager with @entity52 after winning the @entity139 in @entity140 @entity52 won three @entity43 titles with @entity138 before leaving for @entity53 no wonder sir @entity111 was so reluctant to let him leave @entity142			1
ask the greatest of all @entity144 managers what attributes mattered most to him when signing a player , he usually replies along these lines : ‘ if @entity138 are considering someone you can assume he has real talent			0
so what i ’m looking for then is character			0
a lad desperate to win , who will want to keep on and on and on winning			0
’ younger players of that ilk coming up behind @entity52 and who will benefit from ever - improving methods if they so choose - @entity160 genius @entity158 who is naturally so lean and lithe notable among them – might actually remain fully in their prime to 40			1
meanwhile @entity163 has been photographed yet again in a nightclub , for the third time in a pose which suggests he has been smoking			0
@entity52 won his third @entity107 crown this year , and is now one behind his rival @entity77 @entity52 and @entity77 battle for the ball during an @entity172 match at the @entity173 in 2010 @entity174 is fortunate that the rebuke from his @entity177 manager will be moderated by @entity179 ’s admission that he used to smoke and his expression of opinion that the habit ‘ does not necessarily impact on a player ’s performance			1
’ in that , history is on @entity179 ’s side			0
@entity188 was both a cigarette smoker and one of the world ’s outstanding players for a decade , orchestrating from midfield @entity195 ’s 1978 @entity194 triumph under chain - smoking manager @entity197 and lighting up before lifting the @entity198 with @entity199 at @entity200			0
but it is not so much the quick drag which is worrying for we who recognise that @entity163 has the ability to grow into an important player for @entity207			0
it is the louche lifestyle			0
@entity209 ( right ) appeared to be holding a shisha pipe during a night out in @entity211 @entity163 is closing in on a return to full fitness after undergoing ankle surgery former @entity199 midfielder @entity188 in action for @entity195 at the 1978 @entity194 mostly , for top sportsmen , the days are for training , the evenings for rest , the nights for sleeping not clubbing			1
at 23 , @entity163 is young enough to learn from his mistakes and turn his life around			2
as he keeps promising to do			0
but if he leaves it much longer it will be too late for him to fulfil all that talent			0
you have to fear for him			0
because it is also about the money			0
the incentive to prioritise sporting dedication over life ’s temptations comes more naturally to those of more modest means			0
and if you think the £ 100,000 - plus weekly wages of the most celebrated players in this country are ludicrously excessive , you ai n’t seen nothing yet			0
@entity241 face a four - way battle to keep hold of the lion 's share of @entity43 rights a @entity43 already awash with cash is about see its next package deal for three years of tv rights soar above the current £ 3billion			0
to more than £ 8m for a single match			0
that will be the result of a bidding war as two more networks – one the @entity255 parent company of @entity256 , the other in oil - rich @entity258 – go against @entity241 and @entity259 for live games			2
be sure that a large chunk of the extra fortune will be grasped by the star players			0
some will filter down to the @entity28			0
until that happens we wait to see if twenty grand a week will be enough for @entity1 to clamber clear of the drop			1
we can but hope ...			0

@entity1 are second bottom of @entity6 and in relegation danger
the owners of the club are learning that it is a rare breed of young sportsmen who get filthy rich overnight yet are still hungry for success
@entity52 has turned 30 but still in prime physical condition
@entity209 was seen holding a shisha pipe during a night out
