bumbling : @entity0 on stage at the spring conference in @entity3 the @entity4 like to do things differently			2
one of their deputy leaders had just blown a few billion pounds more from their wish - list budget when the chairwoman – who could hardly be seen in her green jumper against the vast green background – announced an ‘ attunement ’			2
this turned out to be a reflective – and to my mind rather long – minute ’s silence			0
‘ it ’s incredibly successful if people get stressed , ’ explained our host , although several people around me merely used the pause to check social media on their smartphones			1
welcome to the world of @entity28 ’s wackiest political party , on display this weekend at its spring conference in @entity3			1
there is something mildly amusing about a party that insists on meditative breaks , has a keynote speaker identified as ‘ a non-binary person from @entity37 ’ and chairwomen who say things like : ‘ i would like to hear from someone who does not identify as a man			1
’ and a party that uses such a contorted form of internal democracy it ends up with daft policies to ban most cars and seriously debates proposals to extend human rights to all animals			1
yet this is currently the country ’s most successful political party , attracting 100 recruits a day from people dismayed by traditional party politics			1
bizarrely , the duffest interviews given by its bumbling leader @entity0 only drive up membership			1
joining the hundreds of enthusiastic delegates – a mixture of grizzly bearded hippies , elderly ideologues , earnest young recruits and well - spoken women in charity shop chic – offered fresh insight into what is now the third biggest party in @entity70 and @entity71			1
they proclaim the politics of the future			0
yet much of the time it felt like i had stumbled into an @entity79 sketch filled with middle - class people munching on non-meat sandwiches as they debated how to save a world wrecked by austerity , bankers and conservatives			1
but it also means they might play an influential role in determining who runs the country after the next election			1
many of these new members – half of whom voted @entity103 at the last election – are young people inspired by the idea of reshaping politics			1
they were given special badges declaring their status and enthusiastically snapped up green t - shirts on sale			0
presumably they were not the people targeted in a seminar explaining how to use email			1
yet for all these new recruits rushing around excitedly , there were also the same old stalls offering vegan recipes for raspberry cake , t - shirts emblazoned with ‘ @entity120 ’ and angry leaflets denouncing the monarchy			1
@entity79 told her followers the @entity4 had gone from 13,000 members a year ago to 55,000 members today on one , i found @entity125 , a friendly 47 - year - old dancer promoting the medicinal use of cannabis			1
he said he had smoked the drug for 26 years to curb anxiety attacks			0
his stall proclaimed ‘ @entity131 with @entity132 ’			0
when i asked about @entity133 , he said its founders ‘ felt there was too much testosterone in the cannabis movement ’ – but they had not turned up and he had forgotten the acronym ’s meaning			0
the @entity141 - born @entity79 promises a new style of politics – which many people might say she exemplifies with her stumbling interviews and inability to explain key policies			1
yet after she spoke on friday , managing to avoid ‘ mind blanks ’ as she promised lots of new taxes , the grey - haired woman next to me could not stop gushing : ‘ i am so excited			0
i feel like i belong here			0
’ she turned out to be a @entity154 deserter			1
and this is why the sudden @entity157 surge is giving her previous party palpitations as it is outflanked on the left			2
indeed , electoral mathematics mean it is possible the @entity4 might not just impact on voting outcomes in may but even be in position to join a coalition led by @entity165			1
this is a party that wants to ban the monarchy , @entity168 , much of the @entity169 , free schools , foie gras and fur – while freeing up drugs , borders , brothels and , said its leader , allowing people to join terror groups such as @entity180			1
yesterday they chucked in free university undergraduate education , joining the @entity4 ’ desires for free social care , free universal childcare , 500,000 extra new homes and a basic income for everyone costing almost three times the budget of the @entity190			0
since they also want to end economic growth , i asked their press team how these policies would be paid for			0
‘ there ’s lots of money around , ’ replied one party veteran , looking at me as though i was stupid			2
a younger colleague said children would not start schooling until six under a @entity157 government – although it is hard to believe this would raise the requisite £ 350 billion or so needed to close the annual gap between their policies and economic reality			0
the @entity210 ’s emphasis on ultra-democracy is admirable , giving all members a voice – but it means scores of strange ideas end up on its statute books since anything is possible with its @entity219 politics			1
among the proposals considered this weekend , for instance , is the extension of human rights to ‘ all sentient life forms ’ with ‘ the murder , torture and kidnapping ’ of dogs and dolphins carrying the same penalties as when such crimes are committed against people			2
leader @entity0 is embraced by @entity157 mp @entity233 i went to one meeting where 19 people were determining a ban on foie gras due to the force - feeding of geese			1
one young man dissented on the grounds this was discriminatory to dairy cows that were being ‘ raped ’ and their calves ‘ murdered ’			0
‘ to have a ban on the dairy industry would not be popular with the public			2
it would be a vote loser , ’ responded session leader @entity246 – although hastily adding he had been a vegan for 44 years in case anyone might think him unsympathetic to animals			0
then there was the well - attended gender group , which agreed people should be allowed ‘ a third option of @entity260 gender ’ on passports – although the discussion leader then confessed this might create risks for people publicly identified as transgender in many countries			2
the meeting also agreed parents should be allowed to avoid putting children down as either male or female on birth certificates			0
one elderly @entity157 from @entity273 , doing his best to keep up , admitted he was confused by the latest terms for transgender people			2
he was not the only one , with talk about @entity279 people – the ‘ i ’ turned out to be for intersex and the ‘ q ’ for questioning			2
at the peace and defence group , software engineer @entity282 said they needed to review policies that were ‘ unnecessarily inflammatory and aggressive ’ towards diplomats and members of the armed forces			1
‘ we do n’t want to single them out as evil , ’ he said			0
but their policy - making process is so ponderous , @entity282 admitted this could not be achieved before the election			2
mind you , they have pledges to pass measures that were actually passed nearly two decades ago			0
such eccentricities might be endearing if the @entity4 had not suddenly emerged as a semi-serious force in @entity28 politics			0
yet its leaders brush aside criticism of policy absurdities by saying they are merely promoting new ideas and looking long - term			0
downstairs in the @entity3 convention centre was a gathering for fans of fantasy games			0
upstairs , they seemed to be playing fantasy politics			0
but if this shambolic bunch ever got a sniff of power , the entire country would be losers .			0

the @entity210 is the third biggest political party in @entity70 and @entity71
attracts 100 recruits a day and has seen membership increase by *42,000*
many of the new members voted for the @entity326 at the last election
greens maybe in a position in may to form a coalition with @entity154
they want to ban monarchy , @entity168 , and much of the armed forces
while freeing up drugs , borders , and allowing people to join terror groups
