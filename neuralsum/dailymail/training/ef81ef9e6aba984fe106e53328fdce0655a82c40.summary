the 68 - year - old pig farmer from @entity9 in @entity7 rides a hog which weighs 250 kg and stands at about 3 feet tall			1
he started riding it when an attack of bronchitis made him too sick to walk , which made him attempt to ride the pig			1
the 68 - year - old swineherd rides a massive pig around the streets the elderly man rides the massive pig ever since an illness made him too sick to walk the man has herded pigs for 30 years , and is commonly known as a ' swineherd ' , an older term for pig farmer that has disappeared into obscurity with the passing of time			2
he was originally skeptical that his idea would pay off , but after giving it a go , he found that it was a lot smoother than he thought it would be			0
after his realisation , he started riding the pig everywhere , from his house to market , to around the town			2
after a nasty bout of bronchitis , the swineherd toyed with the idea of riding the pig , which turned out to be a much smoother ride than he thought it would be the man and his hog have become a slight celebrity sight in the town of @entity9 in @entity7 @entity7 is the world ’s largest pork consumer and half of the world ’s pigs – nearly 480 million – are kept there			1
last year the @entity57 ’s largest pork producing company , @entity55 , was bought by a @entity7 company for £ 4.2billion			0
refuelling : the pig munches on some lettuce to get more energy to carry its rider a little further the pig is so massive , weighing around 250 kg , that the riders feet do n't even touch the ground when he travels on it the man can be seen in all weathers , donning an umbrella when the weather would cause most to travel via car			1
thanks to the pig being a sustainable vehicle , all he needs to keep going is a little bit of fuel for the pig in the form of some lettuce or scraps			0
a smooth ride : the pigs furry hide doubtless make it very comfortable , as the farmer raises a few eyebrows travelling down the roads the pig is doubtless much cheaper than a car , as all it takes is some food rather than expensive petrol this probably makes the pig far cheaper than a regular vehicle , and much more eco-friendly			0
while the 68 - year old is able to walk , he much prefers riding his hog around town			0
the man seems incredibly jovial as he rides his pig , which has given him back the ability to travel around after his sickness while the elderly man has recovered following his sickness and is able to walk short distances , he seems to much prefer using his pig to get around			0
