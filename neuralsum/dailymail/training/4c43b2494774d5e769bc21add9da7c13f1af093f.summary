a man who was convicted of smuggling heroin in his intestines has become the seventh @entity3 beheaded for drug trafficking in @entity5 in a month			1
@entity7 was executed in @entity8 in the @entity9 because he tried to smuggle ' a large quantity of heroin inside his intestines into the @entity5 ' , the @entity6 stated			1
his death brings the number of foreigners and @entity5 executed by the @entity5 for crimes this year to 67 , despite concerns expressed by the international community			1
this is compared to 69 for the whole of last year , according to @entity20			2
the man was executed in @entity8 in the @entity9 because he tried to smuggle ' a large quantity of heroin inside his intestines into the @entity5 ' ( file picture ) the fact that the heroin was found within the man 's intestines suggests he would have ingested the drugs by swallowing a package - a common means for mules to transport illegal drugs			1
the @entity34 reported that a statement from the @entity6 said a royal order was issued to execute the death sentence			0
it added that ' the government of the @entity41 @entity40 is keen on combating narcotics due to their great harm to individuals and the society '			0
the statement concluded by saying the @entity6 is ' warning anyone who tries to commit such actions that he will be punished according to @entity49 '			0
under the @entity52 legal system it can actually be harder to avert execution for crimes without a specific victim , like drug smuggling , than for murder			2
of the 59 people executed by mid-october , 22 had been convicted for smuggling drugs , according to figures compiled by @entity20 from @entity5 media reports			1
the fact that the heroin was found within the man 's intestines suggests he would have ingested the drugs by swallowing a package - a common means for mules to transport illegal drugs ( file pictures ) one @entity5 man , @entity71 , was put to death for sorcery so far this year , the third such case since 2011			1
although such cases are even rarer , judges can also demand execution for adulterers or @entity79 who abandon their faith			0
in @entity5 @entity79 law , charges of violent crimes like murder are usually brought under the system of ' qisas ' , which is retaliation on the principle of @entity88			1
while a murderer would normally be sentenced to death , the victim 's family is permitted to accept ' diyya ' , or blood money , instead of execution			0
the lives of women are worth half those of men , and non-muslims a fraction of the value of @entity79			0
a statement said @entity40 is keen on combating narcotics due to ' their great harm to individuals and the society ' convicts from less wealthy backgrounds , or without tribal connections , who might intercede with the family or tribe of the victim , are more likely to die because it is harder for them to arrange a blood money payment			0
' any execution is appalling , but executions for crimes such as drug smuggling or sorcery that result in no loss of life are particularly egregious , ' said @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity125 director for @entity20			1
@entity5 has no civil penal code that sets out sentencing rules , and no system of judicial precedent that would make the outcome of cases predictable based on past practice			1
@entity40 announced plans for legal reform in 2007 , but judges , drawn from the traditionally conservative clergy , have so far succeeded is putting off meaningful change			0
in 2009 @entity40 replaced the long - serving , conservative justice minister with a younger scholar , @entity139			0
his attempts to introduce more modern training for judges and a system of precedent to make sentencing more predictable have so far been blocked by strenuous opposition from conservatives			0
even @entity5 who want reform generally do not oppose the use of the death penalty by public beheading			2
in the most extreme version of the @entity5 death penalty , known by the @entity156 word for ' crucifixion ' and reserved for crimes that outrage @entity5 society , the corpse is publicly hanged in a harness from a metal gibbet as a warning to others			1
an online film dated april 2012 on the @entity166 website shows a man being executed and then ' crucified ' in this manner , reportedly for robbing a house and killing its occupants			2
a group of five men suffered this fate in may last year in the southern province of @entity175 for a series of robberies .			2

@entity7 *appears* to have swallowed the drugs
he is the 67th person to be executed for crimes in @entity5 this year
*rights* groups are concerned about surge in executions in past months
