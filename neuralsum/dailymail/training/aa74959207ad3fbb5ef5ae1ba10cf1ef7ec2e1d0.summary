@entity1 boss @entity0 will be counting down the days until he can call upon the services of star striker @entity3 once again			2
with @entity3 sidelined and his former strike partner @entity5 now in @entity6 , the @entity4 are crying out for a potent finisher			2
@entity9 ' side have had a staggering 44 shots at goal in their last three @entity13 outings against @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			0
but they have managed to score only two goals in that period			0
@entity20 and @entity21 have squandered superb opportunities in recent league games @entity21 was foiled by @entity24 in @entity1 's recent 3 - 0 defeat against @entity15 in fact , only 21 of those 44 shots were on target which is a frightening statistic considering @entity0 signed two international strikers in @entity20 and @entity31 in a bid to fill the void left by @entity5 's departure			1
@entity1 ran riot against @entity14 at @entity36 last season with @entity38 and @entity21 both scoring twice while @entity3 was also on target in an emphatic 5 - 1 thrashing			1
but the @entity4 are no longer striking fear into the opposition and only claimed a point against a lacklustre @entity14 on sunday thanks to a 97th - minute equaliser by @entity38			1
indeed they were just minutes away from losing their eighth league game of the campaign			0
in contrast they lost just six league games during the entirety of last season			0
@entity1 striker @entity3 has played just three @entity13 games so far this season @entity0 has been unable to call on the services of the departed @entity5 and injured @entity3 @entity38 scored in the 97th minute to help his side claim a point against @entity14 on sunday @entity56 buoyant despite mistakes			1

@entity1 have struggled in front of goal without the injured @entity3 and @entity5 , who *joined* @entity6 in the *summer*
@entity21 and @entity20 have been *wasteful* in front of goal
@entity38 scored 97th minute equaliser against @entity14 at @entity36
