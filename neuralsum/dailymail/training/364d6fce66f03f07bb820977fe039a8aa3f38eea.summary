300 vials of a new @entity2 vaccine will arrive in @entity3 today , to form part of the largest trial into the efficacy of the experimental drug the first batch of an experimental @entity2 vaccine has been shipped to @entity10 , destined to help protect 30,000 people in @entity3			1
the shipment , of an initial 300 vials of the vaccine , marks the first to arrive in one of the three countries worst affected by the @entity2 epidemic			1
the drug will form the basis of the first large - scale vaccine trial , with healthcare workers on the front line treating @entity2 patients , among the first to receive the drug			1
it comes as the @entity27 said this week , the epidemic is showing signs of waning			0
but after ravaging three @entity10 nations and spreading fear from @entity33 to @entity34 , it has hammered home the message that the world needs a better detective system for emerging diseases			0
researchers hope to enrol up to 30,000 people to take part in the trial , a third of whom will get the vaccine , developed by @entity47			1
the drug is currently being tested in five small phase one safety trials in @entity51 , the @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 and involving around 200 volunteers			1
@entity56 , @entity57 global vaccines chief , said : ' the initial phase i data are encouraging and give us confidence to progress to the next phases of clinical testing , which will involve the vaccination of thousands of volunteers , including front line healthcare workers			1
' the drug uses a type of chimpanzee cold virus to deliver safe genetic material from the @entity73 strain of @entity2 , the strain responsible for the unprecedented epidemic in @entity10			1
@entity76 so far show ' an acceptable safety profile ' including in a @entity10 population and across a range of dose levels , @entity47 said , adding it had now selected the most appropriate dosage for the @entity3 trial			1
the @entity27 yesterday said the @entity2 outbreak in @entity10 appears to be waning but cautioned against complacency in an epidemic that has seen 21,724 cases reported in nine countries since it started in @entity89 a year ago			2
some 8,641 people have died , according to @entity27 data			0
mr @entity56 stressed that @entity47 's shot , like other candidates from a @entity95 and @entity96 collaboration , and from @entity97 and @entity98 , is still in development and ca n't be deployed unless and until it proves safe and effective			2
' any potential future use in mass vaccination campaigns will depend on whether the @entity27 , regulators and other stakeholders are satisfied ... and how quickly large quantities ... can be made , ' he said			0
professor @entity105 , from the @entity106 , hailed the move as an ' important step ' in the fight against @entity2			2
he said : ' in order to show that a vaccine works you have to perform phase iii trials in those people most at risk from the infection			0
' make no mistake , this is n't an easy task ; there are huge logistical hurdles to overcome			0
' these vaccines also need cold storage , which is n't always easy to guarantee			0
also , recruitment to the trials will require a huge effort in social engagement and education			0
' dr @entity139 , director of the @entity140 , who is helping fund the new vaccine , added : ' this week we 've heard encouraging news from @entity10 , indicating that we may at last have reached a turning point in what has been the worst @entity2 outbreak in history			1
' the unprecedented speed at which the vaccine preparation has progressed would not have been possible without sheer determination and global partnership between national governments , funders , researchers and pharma companies , and agencies on the ground who have worked tirelessly to get this crisis under control			0
' experts and politicians gathering at this year 's @entity164 in @entity165 have focused on the epidemic , noting the risk posed by pandemic threats such as deadly strains of flu and drug - resistant superbugs			2
@entity27 director general @entity172 , said : ' viruses do not need visas to get across borders			0
' she admitted the international response to future epidemics must be better co-ordinated			0
her own organisation has been criticised for failing to move faster to tackle @entity2 and has acknowledged that it lacked the staff and tools to fight the epidemic adequately early on			2
' the whole world needs a new early - warning system for these diseases , ' said @entity186 , the president of @entity89 - where @entity2 went undetected for three months in early 2014 .			1

300 doses of the @entity47 drug are set to arrive in @entity3 today
