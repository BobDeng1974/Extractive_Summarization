it has been an amazing year of football in many different ways , from the highs and lows of the @entity5 — @entity7 ’s highs and @entity9 ’s lows — to the @entity11 title race			1
for my last column of 2014 , i thought i would dish out some awards for my personal highlights			2
i ’m looking forward to another enthralling time in 2015			2
merry @entity16 ! my @entity17 of 2014 @entity18 — no one has grown more as a player in the last 12 months than @entity18			1
this time last year he had just broken into the @entity23 team and now , at 20 , he is one of the best young players in the world			1
and if his form is n’t quite what it was , that ’s only to be expected from a developing talent			2
@entity23 and @entity9 forward @entity18 has really developed over the last 12 months @entity30 has defied those who said age had caught up with him to produce some stunning form @entity30 — he ’s as solid as he was 10 years ago			1
when analysing on tv , nobody says , ‘ he ’s short for pace there ’ or ‘ he turned a bit slowly here ’			2
there ’s no sign of frailties and there ’s not a better defender in the country			2
@entity30 with @entity47 would have been fabulous at the @entity5 , and it would be now			1
@entity49 — he looked as though his career might ebb away , having left @entity23 with a big move not having worked out			1
but credit to @entity53 , who has had him playing off the front in many games and seen him rejuvenated			1
now the challenge is to sustain that and earn an @entity9 place			2
goal of the year i was in the @entity61 on that evening when @entity62 scored for @entity63 in the last 16 of the @entity5 against @entity64			1
he had his back to play and four players closing him but the key for me was the fact he had a little glance before he shot			2
you teach midfielders to look frequently over their shoulder for all - around awareness — but to do that then play it off his chest and turn was unbelievable			2
@entity49 's career looked as though it was in decline but this season he has had a renaissance @entity62 's spectacular effort for @entity63 against @entity64 wins @entity83 's goal of the year the finish over the goalkeeper and off the bar was sensational but , even before that , he had shown fantastic awareness and skill			1
the early stages of the @entity5 were fabulous and @entity62 played a huge part in lighting up the tournament			1
match of the year there ca n’t be any dispute about this			1
when @entity98 took the field in @entity100 on july 8 , we were all anticipating a tight game with @entity7 as marginal favourites			2
what unfolded in the first half was the most extraordinary and unusual result i ’ve experienced in football			0
it was as though @entity98 were having a collective breakdown			0
although they were missing @entity111 and @entity112 , to watch a team filled with world class and experienced players capitulate in quite such a dramatic way , at home and in front of their own fans , was astounding			0
it was a seismic football moment			0
@entity7 beat hosts @entity98 7 - 1 in the semi-final of the @entity5 , it was a seismic moment in football there can be little dispute that @entity98 's capitulation was the most engrossing match of 2014 buys of the year when you look at the most astute transfers , @entity133 ’s signing of @entity134 last january and @entity136 ’s return to @entity9 football in the summer are right up there			1
but @entity136 is n’t even the best buy at his club — that honour falls on @entity142 and @entity143			0
that ’s a huge compliment to @entity53			1
real football people would n’t doubt him but he has gone from being under pressure at @entity147 , with the fans discontented , to having engineered their best start in the @entity11 and much of it is down to clever recruitment			0
there are n’t many undiscovered gems any more but plucking a player like @entity142 from @entity155 in the @entity157 second division is as close as you get			0
@entity159 shone in the @entity5 but there can always be a risk buying on the back of a good tournament — but @entity147 had clearly done their homework			0
@entity147 get the ball down and play with those two , hitting teams on the break ; when @entity168 comes in , they go a bit more direct			0
they have two ways to play now — @entity159 and @entity142 have added a new dimension to their game			0
@entity53 has this season guided @entity147 to their best - ever start in the @entity11 signings like @entity142 ( above ) and @entity143 have helped boost the @entity147 this season @entity175 the best ideas never disappear ; they simply come back into fashion in a new guise			1
it ’s no secret that i ’ve enjoyed playing the back three and did so with @entity9 in the late 90s , but the system became less used in recent years			0
slowly it is has come back , with coaches such as @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 using it at times , but really it was the @entity5 that brought it right back in to the mainstream			0
there ’s a whole generation of players now who struggle to play against it and @entity199 coach @entity198 , @entity201 ’s @entity200 , @entity202 for @entity203 , @entity205 ’s @entity204 and @entity207 ’s @entity206 caused teams so many problems with it during the tournament and i for one loved watching it			0
@entity201 excelled at the @entity5 , in part due to the tactical decisions of their manager @entity200 new @entity217 boss @entity202 has been a champion of playing three at the back in 2014 @entity219 — @entity220 it may be an obvious choice but it ’s hard to get away from just how well his time at @entity133 is going — though the test will be whether he wins something			1
he made a profit for the club in the summer transfer window and still ended up with a stronger team			1
the balance of the side is lovely			0
do n’t forget , @entity220 is having to accommodate the desire of the owner for attractive football but he ’s doing that without compromising his principles			1
i love the fact he fielded a strong side at @entity244 in the @entity245 — he wants to win every single game			0
i think he ’s doing an even better job than the last time he was at @entity248			0
they ’re chasing four trophies and i believe they will at least have the @entity11 title in 2015 — and maybe they can challenge @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 for the @entity256			1
@entity133 boss @entity220 wins the manager of the year award for his stellar performance at the club and @entity261 boss @entity260 is an early contender for the title for next year 's awards and the manager for next year ? @entity260 his @entity261 side might have lost to @entity23 on wednesday night but the job @entity260 has done on the south coast is extraordinary			1
he took over when they were second bottom of @entity270			0
he had 18 months at @entity271 , which just did n’t work out , but now he has @entity261 on the verge of the @entity11 , playing attractive football			0
they have been helped financially by @entity276 owner @entity275 but , nevertheless , @entity260 , at 37 , has demonstrated that he should have a long career in the game			0
we might be seeing a lot more of him in 2015 .			0

the goal of the year award goes to @entity254 star @entity62
@entity133 boss @entity220 is @entity83 's manager of the year
