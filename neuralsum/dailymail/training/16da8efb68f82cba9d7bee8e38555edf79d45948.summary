by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor sir @entity2 , the chairman of the @entity3 , said it was ‘ simply foolish ’ to believe that the risk of a terrorist attack on the @entity7 was a thing of the past the @entity7 public has become ‘ disturbingly ’ complacent about the terror threat , the spy watchdog has warned			1
sir @entity2 , the chairman of the @entity3 , said it was ‘ simply foolish ’ to believe that the risk of a terrorist attack on the @entity7 was a thing of the past			1
on the eve of the anniversary of the july 7 bombings in @entity20 in 2005 , sir @entity2 warned jihadi extremists were deploying ' devilish technical skill ' to create ever more sophisticated devices			1
passengers arriving at airports in @entity7 , the @entity26 and @entity27 face extra security checks to fly into the @entity29 after warnings an attack was being planned			1
it follows claims @entity35 extremists are making explosives which are undetectable to airport scanners , by using smartphones or tablet computers			2
sir @entity2 , who disclosed that he had been briefed in advance about the measures , said that he had been left in no doubt that they were necessary			1
but he warned some people have become too complacent about the threat , because there had not been a successful bomb attack since 2005 when 52 people were killed by four bombers on tube trains and a @entity20 bus			2
writing in the @entity52 , sir @entity2 rejected claims that a new round of stringent security checks were not needed			1
‘ long queues work their way through security , our clothes are removed , our luggage inspected and our own bodies often examined			2
as of this week it has got worse , especially for flights to the @entity29 , ’ he wrote			1
‘ is it really necessary ? we have seen no planes hijacked for many years			0
none have exploded in the air , like the @entity70 flight over @entity71 in 1988			0
‘ apart from the terrible murder of drummer @entity73 , the last successful @entity35 jihadi terrorist outrage in @entity7 was the @entity20 bombings back in 2005			0
‘ this has resulted in complacency amongst some of the public which is seriously disturbing			1
it is simply foolish to believe that the threat is either minimal or now behind us			0
’ sir @entity2 said it was ' foolish ' to think that because there has not been a successful bomb attack in @entity7 since july 7			1
2005 that the threat had receded the latest security measures imposed last week followed intelligence warnings that @entity91 's chief bomb maker , @entity92 , who is thought to be based in @entity94 , had linked up with jihadists in @entity96 to pass on his skills			2
meanwhile @entity98 , the shadowy leader of the @entity99 - formerly @entity100 - appeared in public before his followers to lead prayers at the @entity104 in @entity105 in northern @entity106 where the extremist group has made sweeping gains			0
@entity109 , 32 , who has survived numerous assassination attempts , is understood to have perfected a device which can be sewn into a human body making it almost impossible to detect by airport security scanners			2
the technology is already thought to have reached @entity7 jihadists in @entity96 and @entity106			0
it is now feared they will return to target flights from the @entity7			0
the alert led to the number of sophisticated body scanners at @entity7 airports being raised from 10 to 21 on friday			0
queues at @entity126 on friday morning , the day after new security checks were brought in to search for so - called ' stealth bombs ' which are feared to be undetectable to airport scanners passengers joined queues starting outside @entity126 airport , with many complaining of delays sir @entity2 , who disclosed that he had been briefed in advance about the measures , said that he had been left in no doubt that they were necessary			1
' i have received fuller information than it has been possible to publish in the newspapers			0
i have no doubt , from what i have learnt , that these new steps are not bureaucratic nor an overreaction			0
sadly , they are unavoidable , ' he wrote			0
@entity146 , the head of @entity147 , has insisted that the each year the security services have intercepted serious plots which ‘ would have led to the deaths and mutilation of many @entity7 citizens ’ , sir @entity2 added			1
. ' the police and the security services have been very successful but we must not underestimate the devilish technical skill of those terrorists who design ever more sophisticated means of concealing explosives in mobile devices , in clothing and in otherwise innocent objects			2
they have been hard at work over the last year			0
