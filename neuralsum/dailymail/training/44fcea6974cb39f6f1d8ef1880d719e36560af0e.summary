from the highest tier of the @entity2 grandstand hangs a banner which bears the message : ‘ @entity5 ’			1
it is an excellent expression of the @entity9 ethos but , as this tremendous contest graphically revealed , it ai n’t necessarily so			1
for wherever we turned on a field awash with talent , we found footballers who had been acquired at great cost , whose gifts seemed to justify the investment			0
@entity19 , built upon the bountiful resources of @entity18 , presented a series of jewels in @entity22 , @entity23 , the mightily impressive @entity24 and @entity25			1
@entity9 , blessed by the favours of an @entity28 billionaire , offered their own gems in @entity30 , @entity31 , the debutant @entity32 ... and @entity33			1
@entity33 put in a grandstand display in midfielder for @entity9 against @entity19 the @entity36 international scored one and assisted one as the game finished 2 - 2 at the @entity2 @entity33 's first was a superb dink over @entity19 goalkeeper @entity42 to level the scores at 1 - 1 of that starry cast , only @entity33 had joined his club without the formality of millions changing hands			1
and yet , so great was his influence , that there were times when he seemed capable of organising the entire glittering ensemble to his own requirements			0
@entity33 , who arrived at @entity9 as a nine - year - old some 13 years ago , delivered the kind of performance for which his public had been praying			1
his ceaseless commitment was an almost mundane virtue , since even limited players can provide lashings of honest endeavour			0
but to that industry he added the qualities which make him remarkable : the speed of thought which takes him into dangerous space , the tight control which transforms vague danger into urgent threat , above all , the ability to assess a bewildering situation and apply the appropriate pass			0
it is a quality which only the exceptional performers possess			0
there was also the maturity which enabled him to accept some fierce challenges and remain resolutely unprovoked			0
he has not always revealed such control , and his hair - trigger temper has frequently undermined his contribution to the cause			2
too often he played like a man who has been listening to bad advice			0
@entity22 celebrates with @entity23 after opening the scoring for @entity19 and @entity30 reels away in style after he thought he 'd given @entity9 the winner late on but a late @entity88 header levelled the scores at 2 - 2 and resulted in game being drawn when @entity92 observed that @entity33 was not the player he had promised to become , that he had not made significant improvement in the past five years , the @entity9 man was affronted by the criticism			1
but @entity92 was right , his strictures were timely , and yesterday the genuine article shone through			1
his manager , @entity98 , had many reasons for satisfaction ; among them the fact that @entity9 had taken a point from a match they could , and possibly should , have lost			1
but clearly it was the display of @entity33 ’s real ability which had given him most pleasure			1
‘ he is coming physically to his level , ’ said @entity98			1
‘ unfortunately , it has taken him time to find that fraction of a second where you feel you can make a difference			0
it was the first time this season he found it over 90 minutes			0
’ he might have gone further , but we sensed he was tempting fate with his praise			0
he has known too many false dawns where @entity33 is concerned to be carried away by one minor masterpiece			1
but his face told the tale more convincingly than his words			0
@entity33 ’s goal was the kind of accomplishment which only the best players can manage			1
for once , all the @entity9 passing came together as the ball was worked through the centre of the @entity19 defence			1
when the final ball was played by @entity131 , @entity33 still had much to do			1
but he deceived @entity132 with a shuffle of feet , bore down on the keeper , and played his chip into the only space available			0
@entity92 had been critical of @entity33 before the game but praised for him afterwards and @entity98 was also pleased with the display of his much - scrutinised midfielder his contribution to @entity143 ’s second was almost as decisive			1
discovering space on the fringe of the @entity147 area , he stole the swiftest of glances , forced some essential pace on a difficult header and found @entity30			2
the new man ’s volley was sumptuous , a piece of instinctive skill which almost validated his monstrous fee , but @entity33 ’s assistance had been crucial to the score , and his glee was gratifying			2
@entity19 raised their own level of performance to impressive heights , and with a nudge from fortune and the barest glimmer of basic competence from the referee @entity167 , they would have found reward			2
when they are good , they are very , very good , and at times they were close to their best			0
but their most formidable foe was the small , stocky young man in @entity9 ’s midfield ; up for the fight , ready to answer skill with skill , aggression with sheer ability			2
once again , @entity98 ’s face told the story			2
he looked remarkably like a gambler for whom the horse had run kindly , the wheel had spun truly			0
on a different day , he might have settled for a small eulogy of the excellent @entity32 , who announced himself with a smooth insertion of pace and the kind of technique which allowed him to chip @entity42 in full stride			0
@entity32 was lively on his debut for @entity9 following his £ 16million switch from @entity191 but he missed a gilt - edged first half opportunity when he hit the post after electing to chip @entity42 had the chance not bounced off the inside of a post , the @entity194 would have been still more clamorous			1
but @entity32 ’s speed and presence offered @entity33 the target he has been seeking , and the promise is of a profitable alliance			2
the last word on @entity33 was spoken by his most perceptive critic			2
‘ that ’s the kind of midfielder i always thought he was going to be , an attacking midfielder , ’ said @entity92			1
then because his nature is cautious and his attitude that of a hard - nosed old pro , he sounded the mandatory note of caution			0
‘ it ’s still early in the season , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s his first goal , and time will tell			0
what he ’s done is make a great start , and now he ’s got the base to go on and have a great season			0
’ it was as close as @entity92 gets to effusive acclaim			2
and i suspect @entity33 will settle for that .			2

@entity33 was the standout player for @entity9 against @entity19
@entity227 finished 2 - 2 in an *entertaining* encounter at the @entity2
scored a superb equaliser in the game before setting up @entity30 to put @entity9 in front before @entity88 levelled late on
