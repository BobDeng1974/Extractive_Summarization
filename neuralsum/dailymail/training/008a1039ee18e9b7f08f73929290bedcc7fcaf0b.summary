concerns are growing today for a dolphin which has swum 50 miles inland along a tidal river			0
the bottlenose dolphin - the most common breed spotted in @entity6 waters - has ventured up the @entity7 and into the @entity8			1
it has been photographed in the water as far inland as @entity11 and @entity12 near @entity13			1
wrong turn : the bottlenose dolphin has been seen 50 miles inland as far as @entity12 on the @entity8 experts say it is likely to have followed fish upstream during high tides but there are fears it could get stuck if it ventures any further			1
@entity23 , 19 , who shot a video of the dolphin on saturday night , said : ' it was definitely one of the most incredible things i have seen			0
' it was an incredible site as i ’ve never seen a dolphin in the wild			0
' my grandparents have a slipway so i sat at the bottom of it and just watched him for hours , he came very close to the bank and i could have touched it he was that close			2
' @entity23 contacted @entity40 and the @entity41 but they are not allowed to intervene because the animal is not beached and still swimming freely			0
experts say the dolphin is likely to have followed fish upstream during high tides but there are fears it could get stuck if it ventures any further the dolphin has swum up the @entity7 as far as @entity12 near @entity13 however , experts say they will become concerned if the creature swims as far as @entity53 - on the other side of @entity13 - where a porpoise once got stranded in 2009			1
@entity56 , operations manager for the @entity40 , said : ' when we have high tides fish might come up higher as well			1
' dolphins follow the fish and can end up quite far along rivers			2
' this is a bottlenose dolphin and they live in what ’s called a fish infused society and what happens there is , individuals will move away from their family for a period , for what might be weeks , months or years , before returning			2
' we do know there are bottlenose dolphins in the @entity7 at the moment so it may just have wandered off			0
' the only concern we have is that if it went much higher , and went over @entity79 it would be very difficult to get back , and there is a bore [ tidal surge ] next week so we hope it would be well out of the way by then			0
