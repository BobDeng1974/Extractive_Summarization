@entity0 says @entity1 is ready to rumble after returning to full fitness with a new muscular physique			1
as @entity4 revealed earlier this month , @entity1 has built up his upper body and core strength during his gruelling rehabilitation programme after a knee injury to prepare for the rigours of @entity11 football			1
the @entity13 midfielder is set to make his first start since october in sunday 's @entity16 clash against @entity17			1
@entity18 boss @entity0 has confirmed suggestions that @entity1 has improved his core strength @entity18 playmaker @entity1 worked on his core strength during his lengthy spell on the sidelines @entity0 joked @entity1 will be happier when he looks in the mirror after working on his upper body strength while @entity1 ’s quality has not been questioned since his arrival from @entity28 18 months ago , his slender frame led to suggestions that he can be bullied by top - flight defenders			1
but his new muscular frame should help him stand up to the physical nature of @entity34 football			0
‘ he is bigger in the upper body , he has worked hard , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ every day he is in the gym and he can work on it			0
you do n’t have the fatigue of the games — and it ’s better when you look in the mirror ! ‘ it is not only down to pure strength when you play			2
it is down to when to switch your strength on and the timing of your switch - on			2
‘ players like @entity51 , for instance , were not monsters but when he went for a challenge he had the technique to use his strength in an efficient way			0
@entity58 defensive midfielder @entity51 knew exactly when to use strength ‘ it is a technique more than a power			0
a guy who spends a bit of time in the gym kills his co-ordination and becomes more rigid			0
‘ winning a challenge is down to flexibility and co-ordination , switching on all the muscles at the right time			0
that is not down to lifting weights			0
’ how the @entity18 manager fits @entity1 , the club ’s record signing , into his starting @entity72 is a problem he must solve in the coming weeks			1
with @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 all vying for attacking midfield positions , it is not a foregone conclusion that @entity1 will be an automatic choice			1
@entity0 added : ‘ he will come back very strong and we have the luxury to have some players who are completely fresh and rested			2
it can be very interesting if you manage to use them well			0

@entity0 has confirmed @entity1 beefed up during injury spell
@entity4 revealed earlier this month that @entity1 had improved his strength
