the furious backlash against the @entity2 ’s top prosecutor intensified last night over her decision to spare @entity4 from the dock			1
the position of director of public prosecutions @entity7 looked increasingly fragile as she faced growing calls to stand down			1
campaigners , police chiefs and mps accused her of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an @entity19 cover - up that lingers over the case			1
and even her one of her predecessors said the horrific allegations should have been resolved in the ‘ full public glare of a courtroom ’ rather than her @entity28 office			2
but the row showed no sign of abating as further details of the claims levelled against the 86 - year - old @entity46 life @entity47 were made public			2
the decision not to charge @entity4 last week despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims was justified because mrs @entity7 said experts agreed that the former @entity54 mp was in such poor health due to advanced @entity56			1
but she also ruled that he should have been charged three times before in 1991 , 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook			0
the top @entity60 blamed police and prosecutors and launched in independent review , but her comments stoked fears that @entity4 is the beneficiary of a wholesale cover - up			1
yesterday , calls were growing for a judicial review of her decision , something which @entity72 has said it is already considering			0
@entity73 , the @entity46 mp who exposed @entity74 , said the weight of criticism against mrs @entity7 suggested something has ‘ clearly gone very badly wrong ’			1
ms @entity7 ruled not to charge @entity4 ( pictured ) despite evidence of 22 offences because of his poor health due to @entity56 he said : ‘ mrs @entity7 is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it ’s hard to see how her position remains tenable			1
’ criticism of mrs @entity7 began with comments from the home secretary , who has already been lobbied by senior police chiefs , when she said is ‘ very concerned ’			1
@entity89 said : ‘ i have been very clear in everything i have said so far about the child sex abuse issue – i expect to see justice done			0
’ she was joined by former @entity93 who said a ‘ trial of the facts ’ should have been considered			0
this would have enabled a jury to decide the facts without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed – offering a chance for victims to be heard			0
@entity103 said : ‘ it might have been wiser for the @entity39 to say ‘ we ’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the @entity109			0
’ further questions also emerged about the true state of @entity4 ’s health as it was revealed he wrote to the @entity114 just a fortnight ago to extend his role			2
the politician , who has claimed tens of thousands of pounds in expenses in recent years , took a formal leave of absence last october			0
when asked if he would consider retiring when the election was called , he responded in a personally signed letter received on april 9 asking to continue in office			0
experts said victims may now be denied the opportunity to sue @entity4 because none of the claims have been proven			2
@entity127 said : ‘ a finding that the acts took place may have consequences for the defendant , particularly one who has the benefit of an honour from the @entity135			0
’ mrs @entity7 has also come under fire over other high - profile cases , including the first disastrous attempt for a conviction for female genital mutilation and the pursuit of journalists .			2
