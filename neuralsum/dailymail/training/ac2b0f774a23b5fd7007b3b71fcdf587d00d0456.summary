by @entity0 the roast potatoes are crisping up nicely ; the turkey is turning a perfect shade of brown			0
all the trimmings are ready to serve and even the kids are looking forward to the sprouts			0
do n’t fancy a traditional @entity9 dinner this year ? let them eat cake ! that ’s what everything on this festive plate is made from , right down to the pigs - in - blankets and those mouth - watering baby carrots			1
feast : this family start to dig in to a @entity9 dinner which is made solely from cake , provided by @entity22 the turkey may look real , but it ’s actually a multi-layer sponge			1
the sprouts are little chocolate cakes in disguise ; the cranberries are made from sugar paste			2
and if you ’re still hungry after that , you can eat the plate			0
it ’s the brainchild of cake designer @entity33 , who swapped a grown - up job in advertising 12 years ago to start a business aimed at putting the fun back into baking			1
her alternative @entity9 offering took more than 40 hours to create , not counting the days of brain - racking that went into perfecting a feast that ’s not quite what it seems			1
a three - strong team led by @entity45 at @entity33 ’s @entity47 - based firm @entity46 crafted it using familiar ingredients such as marzipan , sponge , jam and chocolate			1
‘ it ’s one of the more unusual things we ’ve created , ’ says @entity33 , who also runs a cake school that teaches up to 5,000 pupils a year			2
‘ we ’ve made all sorts of food — sushi , a cheeseboard , burgers — as well as sexy cakes you would n’t want to describe in a family newspaper			2
‘ it ’s a bit of fun and we hope it will encourage more people to became interested in making cakes			2
’ @entity71 vanilla sponge , constructed like a giant , oblong sandwich with alternate layers of sponge , vanilla butter cream and raspberry preserve			0
pale light brown coloured fondant icing , lifted on to shaped sponge with a 2ft rolling pin , then crafted into a roast turkey shape			0
tinted with liquid food colouring using an airbrush technique ; glazed with edible food glaze			0
the @entity85 turkey weighs as much as a real one — 14lb ( just over 6kg )			0
first step : @entity45 , lead chef at cakes4funshop , cuts the sponge into shape carved : the cake is sliced into shape and covered in buttercream icing on the cake : @entity93 lays a huge sheet of fondant icing over her creation shaping : she then moulds the sheet expertly around the turkey cake finishing touches : finally , she sprays on liquid food glaze to give the bird the proper colour			1

it may look real , but every element of this meal - from the carrots to the bird to the plates - is made of cake and icing
the *bizarre* spread was produced by @entity22 , a which aims to put the fun back in baking
a team of three chefs spent more than 40 hours putting the feast together
