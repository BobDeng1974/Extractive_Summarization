new research suggests that many racy photos and messages , known as sexts , are sent out of obligation to a partner , instead of for fun			0
young people in committed relationships regularly send and receive unwanted sexts out of necessity and men are just as unenthusiastic about them as women , according to a study			1
university students in committed relationships regularly send and receive unwanted explicit messages and photos out of necessity and men are just as unenthusiastic about them as women , a new study suggests @entity28 scientists behind the study have dubbed the messages not sent for pleasure as ‘ requisexts ’			1
the research reveals that just as some couples go along with sex to please their partner or avoid an argument , the same is true of e-sex and sexts			0
psychologists from @entity41 polled 155 undergraduates , who were in committed relationships , about their sexting habits and discovered that sexting is common among young adult undergraduates			1
a graph showing the frequency with which women and men engaged in unwanted but consensual sexting			2
the study found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood , while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner their study , which will be published in the journal computers in human behaviour , found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood , while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner			2
the numbers are similar to a previous report about ‘ compliant sexual activity ’ which revealed that 55 per cent of @entity28 women and 35 per cent of men had had sex to keep their partner happy when they were n’t feeling like it , the @entity66 reported			2
the psychologists believe gender role expectations could help to explain the behaviour , as men are more likely to engage in unwanted sexting because joining in is ‘ relatively easy and does not require them to invest more into the relationship ’			1
women insecure in their long - term relationship who feared being dumped were more likely to be requisexters , perhaps in the hope the act make their partner seem less distant , the study said they also think that women might be turned off by sexting as it does not help them reach relationship ‘ goals ’ , but when polled , some of the survey ’s participants said they simply did it because they were bored			1
people mostly participated in an exchange of x-rated pictures for ‘ flirtation , foreplay , or to meet partner ’s needs , ’ as well as boosting intimacy , the study said			1

’ the perfect recipe for love used to be eyes meeting across a crowded room followed by hours of scintillating conversation but now it seems that stimulating chats have been replaced by 140 - character tweets			0
according to a recent study , @entity124 is now the most common way of winning over a potential new partner and has even overtaken texting and phone calls			0
on average , it now takes 224 tweets , 163 text messages , 70 @entity133 messages , 37 emails and 30 phone calls to seal the deal			0
the study , which was conducted by electronics retailer @entity138 , found that within the space of a single generation , the amount of time taken for love to blossom has more than halved			0
couples aged 55 and over said on average their courting process took more than two and a half months ( 78 days ) whereas for those under the age of 25 it takes just under one month ( 24 days ) for them to refer to each other as boyfriend and girlfriend			0
as a result , researchers believe that this could signals the end of the traditional ' three day rule ' where would - be lovers wait for 72 hours before calling a date back			2
instead , it 's now closer to three hours , with two thirds saying they were happy to contact their new beau within four hours of their first date .			0
