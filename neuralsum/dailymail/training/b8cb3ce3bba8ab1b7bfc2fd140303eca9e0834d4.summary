by @entity1 reporter a polish captain ran his massive ship aground off the @entity5 coast after plotting a straight line from @entity7 to @entity8 - forgetting that @entity9 was in the way , it is claimed			1
blundering @entity12 had been using an unapproved gps device to navigate - similar to a car 's @entity14 , an investigation revealed			1
and the lookout on board the 80 metre - long @entity17 cargo ship was asleep when time the enormous vessel crashed into @entity21 , off the @entity22 , last march			1
disaster : the stricken @entity17 sitting on a mud bank on @entity21 after its captain did not realise he was approaching land the disaster at the @entity21 nature reserve , in @entity27 , sparked fears at the time it would break up and its 27 tonnes of diesel fuel and 1,500 tonnes of timber would decimate the wildlife for decades			1
coastguard surveyor @entity35 told a @entity39 @entity38 documentary : ' they basically said " well ok we 're sailing from @entity41 and we 're going to @entity42 and we 'll draw a line and we 'll go the quickest way possible " , without really thinking			1
' following the accident coastguard surveyor , @entity35 , detained the vessel at @entity47			2
@entity48 : the ship 's captain headed in a straight line from @entity41 , @entity7 , to @entity42 , @entity8 , forgetting @entity9 was in his way he said from the evidence they looked at there was a serious failing of the ship 's safety management system			1
he says : ' he was using an unapproved electronic chart plotter , which is basically a bit like your gps for the car			0
' mr @entity35 says from the time the @entity17 left @entity41 to the time it went to ground , there were two positions on the chart			2
he said : ' they basically said ' well ok we 're sailing from @entity41 and we 're going to @entity42 and we 'll draw a line and we 'll go the quickest way possible , ' without really thinking			1
' usually a bridge look - out should still have spotted the @entity21 and its flashing lighthouse			0
mr @entity35 added : ' if he 's fallen asleep it will alarm in the captain 's cabin and if the captain does n't acknowledge it , it will ring everywhere			2
' now the @entity17 did have a very basic bridge watch alarm , but it was switched off			0
' but the @entity84 owner of the @entity17 , @entity85 , tells the @entity39 in @entity86 - where the vessel is being repaired - stresses it was his company policy to use it and he blames the captain and the @entity90 for the accident			2
he tells the programme : ' the technique is perfect , it 's the humans that make mistakes '			0
blunder : captain @entity12 's ship hit @entity21 , which is home to 80,000 pairs of seabirds and a large grey seal colony he subsequently fired captain @entity102 , and the first mate			1
captain @entity12 via telephone then tells the @entity39 in broken @entity9 about whether the first mate did fall asleep and captain @entity12 replies : ' it is what he told in his statement and it looks like it is true			0
' and he admits that if he had used the alarm system the accident could have been prevented , adding : ' yes but i forgot			0
for sure this would not happen ( if the alarm had been used )			0
' eventually the ship was floated away but new research shows the captain was trying to sail a straight line from @entity7 to @entity122 , in @entity8 - and forgot about @entity9 's jutting - out coastline in the middle			1
built in 2001 , the ship was sailing six months ago with a cargo of timber but just six crew			2
when it ran aground , a lifeboat was scrambled to the scene from @entity131 and as the weather worsened and the drama unfolded , wildlife wardens on the @entity135 feared an environmental disaster			0
the islands are home to about 80,000 pairs of seabirds and a large grey seal colony			1
warning : a lighthouse on @entity21 warns approaching ship of the dangers in the seas nearby @entity146 , @entity147 , says : ' to have a boat like that run aground and obviously if it had started breaking up with fuel oil and the likes spilling into the sea , it would have been devastating			2
' @entity38 also reveals that 95 per cent of @entity5 's freight is shifted by sea and last year a third of all ships detained for serious breaches were found in the @entity158			0
however @entity5 authorities have still to decide whether to bring criminal charges in the case of the @entity17			0
the programme will be broadcast tonight on @entity39 ( @entity158 & @entity163 ) at 7.30pm .			0
