the token activists who do not dig into their pockets to give financial support have been dubbed ' slacktivists ' by researchers			2

social media users who declare support for charities may look good but they are less likely to actually hand over cash , according to a new report			1
the more public the declaration , the less likely a person was to donate ' our research shows that if people are able to declare support for a charity publicly in social media it can actually make them less likely to donate to the cause later on			1
' scientists say it is vital for charities to take note of the findings , which hint at a long - term loss of income in a series of studies , researchers invited participants to engage in an initial act of free support for a cause - joining a @entity47 group , accepting a poppy , pin or magnet or signing a petition			1
participants were then asked to donate money or volunteer			0
they found that the more public the token show of endorsement , the less likely participants are to provide meaningful support later			2
if participants were provided with the chance to express token support more privately , such as confidentially signing a petition , they were more likely to give later			0
the researchers suggest this occurs because giving public endorsement satisfies the desire to look good to others , reducing the urgency to give later			0
providing token support in private leads people to perceive their values are aligned with the cause without the payoff of having people witness it			0
with the holiday season being the biggest fundraising period of the year , the researchers say it is vital that charities take another look at their strategies and plan appropriately			0
the study features in the forthcoming @entity82 .			0

many charities believe that social media is an *efficient* way to *boost* income
but **experts** believe that connecting with would - be donors on sites such as @entity92 and @entity47 could be *counterintuitive*
**experts** found that the more public the show of support , the less likely a person was to give money to a charity
