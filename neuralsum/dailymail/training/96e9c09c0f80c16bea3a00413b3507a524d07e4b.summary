the @entity1 administration floated a plan tuesday that for the first time would open up a broad swath of the @entity5 to drilling , even as it moved to restrict drilling indefinitely in environmentally - sensitive areas off @entity9			1
the proposal envisions auctioning areas located more than 50 miles off @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , and @entity15 to oil companies no earlier than 2021 , long after president @entity1 leaves office			1
for decades , oil companies have been barred from drilling in the @entity5 , where a moratorium was in place up until 2008			2
the plan also calls for leasing 10 areas in the @entity23 , long the epicenter of @entity26 offshore oil production , and three off the @entity9 coast			1
' the areas off the table are very small in comparison to areas on the table			0
' the plan , which covers potential lease sales in the 2017 - 2022 time frame , drew immediate reaction from @entity66 , where @entity9 @entity38 sen. @entity37 called it a war on her home state , and where @entity71 @entity70 objected to the proposal for the @entity5 , saying an oil spill knows no boundaries			1
the proposal comes as the @entity26 is in the midst of an oil boom and when oil prices , and pump prices , are at near - historic lows			1
' opening up the @entity5 coast to drill for fossil fuel is unnecessary , poses a serious threat to coastal communities throughout the region , and is the wrong approach to energy development in this country , ' said @entity90 sens. @entity89 and @entity91 , and rep. @entity92 , all @entity70 , in a statement			0
but many politicians from @entity96 states support offshore drilling , and had lobbied the administration to open federal waters off their coasts			2
' exploring for energy off the coast is a critical economic development issue , ' said @entity14 gov. @entity104 , a @entity38			2
' it will mean jobs and investment for our state , and , while we will always make safeguarding our rich natural resources a priority , it 's encouraging to see the federal government finally acknowledge what we 've been fighting for with our federal delegation for years			2
' @entity116 officials cautioned that they were in the early stages of a multi-year process , with @entity50 saying they were only ' considering ' a lease sale in the @entity5 and that areas could be ' narrowed or taken out entirely in the future			0
' for @entity9 , president @entity1 issued a memorandum tuesday placing 9.8 million acres of the state 's offshore resources off limits indefinitely			1
the memorandum withdraws from leasing parts of the @entity129 and @entity130 seas , as well as a shallow 30 - mile shelf in northwestern @entity9 called @entity132 , citing their importance to @entity9 natives and the sensitive environmental resources			1
' there are some places that are too special to drill , and these areas certainly fit that bill , ' @entity50 said			0
@entity1 in early 2010 announced his intention to allow drilling 50 miles off the @entity12 coast , only to scrap it after the @entity144 oil spill in the @entity23			1
but the administration has allowed oil and gas companies to explore for oil and gas in the @entity5 in the meantime , which is the initial step prior to drilling			0
environmental groups were quick to criticize the proposal , saying offshore drilling had not gotten safer in the years after the @entity144 disaster			0
deep water drilling platforms are controversial because of the possibility of spills from underwater wells that can only be capped with great difficulty and at great expense leave it alone ? most of @entity9 's @entity165 is mostly barren land but could produce trillions of dollars in energy resources @entity170 , despite recommendations , has not passed any new laws to deal with the lapses identified in the wake of the spill , which was the largest offshore incident in @entity26 history			1
' this 5 - year plan could destroy our coastal economies for decades to come , costing future generations the fishing livelihoods that have been part of their local fabric for generations , ' said @entity185 's vice president @entity184			2
but the oil industry applauded the move , saying much of the @entity26 's offshore potential remains untapped			1
production from offshore areas accounts for 16 percent of the oil produced in the @entity26 now			2
the @entity192 said in a statement that while the proposal is a step in the right direction , it ' urges the administration to keep all offshore areas available to exploration			0
' according to documents obtained by @entity201 through the @entity202 , at least four firms have filed applications with federal fisheries managers to conduct wide - scale seismic imaging surveys in the @entity5 to explore for oil and gas deposits			0
the applications for ' incidental harassment ' of marine animals including endangered right whales are currently being reviewed by @entity212			0
the projects involve towing seismic air guns behind vessels for hundreds of miles , over months and years			0
the guns emit strong bursts of air and sound , which allow crews to create two - and - three - dimensional images of the seafloor .			0

@entity45 wants to open up the waters off @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , and @entity15 to first - ever oil drilling rigs
but at the same time @entity1 is moving to declare nearly all of @entity9 's @entity42 off - limits
one @entity9 senator is angry that the president is *willingto* *negotiate* with @entity233 , but not with @entity26 's 49th state
@entity1 's interior secretary *insisted* that some places ' are simply too *precious* to develop '
the president made an *anti-drilling* video about @entity9 on @entity241 this week while burning 5 *gallons* of jet fuel per mile
