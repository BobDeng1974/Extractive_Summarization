by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 20:02 est , 5 march 2013 @entity2 's letters of apology earned him a slashed prison sentence a serial thief who admitted more than 70 burglaries had his sentence halved after he wrote letters to his victims claiming drugs forced him to steal			1
@entity2 , 26 , stole £ 200,000 worth of goods from homes and businesses in a spate of burglaries described by a judge as ‘ immense ’			1
but he escaped the typical five - year sentence for his crimes after writing apologies to those he burgled , telling them it was ‘ nothing personal ’			0
last night one of his victims said she was unimpressed with the apology , and it did nothing to help ease the upset of losing treasured family jewellery			0
@entity2 , a career criminal with a 12 - year history of offending , faced up to his latest crimewave after he was charged with stealing jewellery during three break - ins at homes in @entity37 in @entity38			1
he admitted a further four commercial burglaries , 47 house burglaries and 12 attempted house burglaries in @entity38 , as well as seven burglaries in @entity43			2
the court heard how @entity2 ’s previous offences included being drunk and disorderly , dishonesty , possession of drugs , and assaulting a police officer			1
he previously served three years in a young offenders institution for robbery and in 2008 received a suspended sentence for burglary and handling stolen goods			0
but during sentencing , @entity56 said her client was clean from drugs and should be given credit for showing remorse			2
in one of the letters to victims read out in court , @entity2 wrote : ‘ i burgled your house because i was abusing drugs			1
i had no concept of remorse			2
‘ i only cared about one thing at the time and that ’s me and getting money for drugs			2
i hope this letter gives you closure			0
i hope you realise there was nothing personal about the offence ; i did not target you or your family			0
’ @entity2 had originally been charged with three burglaries in nearby @entity37 , before admitting to a host of other crimes judge @entity86 , at @entity87 , said @entity2 had ‘ embarked on a catalogue of house burglaries of an immense nature ’			1
judge @entity86 said the scale of @entity2 's crimes was ' immense ' he said the starting point for sentencing would normally be five years ’ custody , but because @entity2 pleaded guilty and tried to ‘ wipe the slate clean ’ he would cut this to two - and - a - half years			1
one of @entity2 ’s victims last night said she did not believe he had turned over a new leaf			2
the woman , who did not wish to be named , added that @entity2 had done nothing to help trace jewellery belonging to her mother and grandfather that he took from her four - bedroom detached home in @entity37			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t think that ( the letter ) will help because i do n’t have much faith it ’s going to make a difference			0
’ last november , @entity2 stole jewellery belonging to her mother , who died months earlier , and a signet ring that belonged to her grandfather , who was killed in the @entity115			0
she said : ‘ at the time , i thought i ’d really like to talk to him and see if he realises the upset he ’s caused			0
these people look at a home like mine and think “ big house means lots of money ” , but that ’s not always the case			0
