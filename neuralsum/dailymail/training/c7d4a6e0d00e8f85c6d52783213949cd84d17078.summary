by @entity1 reporter published : 23:52 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 04:40 est , 29 august 2013 ' @entity3 ' collapse : @entity4 , 23 , who died after collapsing during the @entity5 a fit and healthy young man died following a ' catastrophic and unsurvivable ' collapse as he ran a marathon , an inquest has heard			1
@entity4 , 23 , from south - east @entity10 died , fell ill around 16 miles into the race as he competed in the @entity5 in @entity12 on april 14 this year			1
the biology graduate had embarked on the 26 - mile running challenge to raise money for the arms around the child charity which supports @entity19 orphans			2
although he had asthma , he was considered fit and his respiratory problems had not contributed to his sudden collapse , an inquest at @entity24 heard			1
instead , mr @entity4 , of @entity25 , died after suffering from ischemic bowel disease , which can cause up to 75 per cent of blood flow to be removed from the bowel			2
dr @entity29 , consultant pathologist at @entity5 's @entity30 , said the condition is initially reversible but can progress , leading to fatal circumstances			1
dr @entity29 told the hearing : ' we know that up to half of people who run marathons develop symptoms relating to their gastro - intestines			1
' they can be minor stomach cramps , diahorrea , but on the other end of the scale , ischemic bowel can be exhibited in endurance exercise			2
' he added : ' when it gets to that critical stage , depending on how much of the bowel has died , depends on whether the person can survive			2
' unfortunately in @entity4 , it was catastrophic and unsurvivable			2
' it was initially thought that mr @entity4 had suffered a heart attack , and attempts were made at cpr as he laid in the road			2
but mr @entity4 went into cardiac arrest and his death from ischemic bowel , described by @entity5 and @entity62 coroner @entity61 as ' extraordinarily rare and unusual ' , was confirmed at 2.30pm			1
event : runners compete during this year 's @entity5			1
mr @entity4 , 23 , fell ill around 16 miles into the race dr @entity29 said : ' i think when someone collapses in a marathon , the most common thing to think is that they have had a heart attack			1
' the initial reaction would have been to do cpr and that was started rapidly			2
if he had been taken to hospital immediately , might it have made a difference ? i do n't think so			0
' i believe all his bowel was dead at that stage and even if ( medical staff ) thought of ischemic bowel , it would n't have been any help at all at that stage			0
' mr @entity4 probably did not notice he had ischemic bowel as its ' non-specific ' symptoms , such as pain and discomfort , may have led him to believe they were linked to his running			0
gastro - intestinal problems suffered by people associated with endurance sport were being increasingly examined in studies , dr @entity29 added			0
attempting to reach mr @entity4 amid the crowds of marathon runners and spectators was difficult , a senior @entity97 ( @entity98 ) staff member said			1
although mr @entity4 had asthma , he was considered fit and his respiratory problems had not contributed to his sudden collapse the marathon had its own medical team but @entity107 , @entity98 's medicines management lead and paramedic practitioner , said clearer identification would have helped to distinguish who was who on site			1
he also told the inquest of a ' communication confusion ' , with marshals unable to tell him where mr @entity4 was as he ran for about 500 yards through the large crowds carrying equipment			1
' when i asked a couple of the marshals ' where 's the incident ? ' , they said ' i do n't know '			0
' as mr @entity107 went on to the race track , he could see people waving at him , alerting him to mr @entity4 's position			0
mr @entity107 said : ' in reality , it only took me minutes , as i did run as fast as i could , but obviously minutes in any cardiac incident is crucial			1
' he said the problems could have been helped by having more markers along the race route , rather than ones that marked every mile			0
ms @entity135 suggested a possible solution : equipping runners with a gas canister - activated buoy which would rise above the crowds in an emergency			1
she said : ' this could mean that you are looking up rather through a sea of people			0
' despite the difficulties , mr @entity107 praised the level of care mr @entity4 received from the medical team , saying it was to a ' high standard '			0
and he did not think the access problems he encountered ultimately affected the patient			0
speaking about mr @entity4 , he said : ' he had no heartbeat , no pulse and no breathing			0
' from the small amount of history at the event , it was a sudden collapse			0
i do n't think he would have known anything about it			0
' the inquest is due to last until friday .			0
