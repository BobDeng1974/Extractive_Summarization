@entity2 is hailed as a driving force in the successful scouting and hiring structure that has seen the @entity3 turn a troubled summer into a remarkable success with their improved squad coming at a profit of £ 37million			1
' we are delighted to announce that @entity2 has joined the @entity18 , ' @entity0 announced on their website before outlining his background			1
@entity0 sold @entity21 to @entity23 giants @entity22 for £ 86million in 2013 @entity2 's task is to overhaul @entity0 's scouting system and have the success he did at @entity3 @entity0 technical director @entity27 could be heading for the @entity29 exit door @entity30 , 29 , @entity31 , £ 26.4m verdict : underwhelming			1

@entity37 , 22 , am , £ 25.7m verdict : nearly - man			1
lavish talent but no goals in 20 @entity35 games			0
paulinho @entity42 , 26 , @entity43 , £ 17.4m verdict : @entity44 from the best midfielder in north @entity6 , let alone @entity42			1
@entity47 @entity46 , 26 , @entity43 , £ 9.7m verdict : jury out			2
patchy form and injuries have disrupted his season			0
@entity53 @entity52 , 22 , @entity43 , £ 11.5m verdict : @entity54			2
brilliant last season , less so this			0
10 @entity35 goals , eight assists			0
@entity58 , 21 , @entity59 , £ 10m verdict : miss. one @entity35 game is a poor return			2
@entity63 @entity62 , 25 , @entity59 , £ 8.5m verdict : middling at best			2
@entity64 , 27 , @entity59 £ 8m verdict : @entity65 - prone , two red cards already			2
@entity67 , 25 , am , £ 7.2m verdict : hit			2
best value of all , @entity35 goals ( seven ) and assists ( four )			0
@entity72 @entity71 , 20 , @entity59 , £ 4m verdict : promising			2

@entity80 ( @entity79 , 21 , £ 2.5m ) & @entity81 ( @entity82 , 31 , £ 5m ) @entity80 on loan			0
vorm yet to play in @entity35			0
' a former player with @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity2 initially took up the role of community ambassador with the @entity86 when he retired from playing in 2009 at the age of 27			1
' following the appointment of @entity91 as manager in 2010 , @entity2 was assigned to his back room staff as @entity94 , recognising his aptitude for identifying player talent			1
' he joined @entity3 in january , 2012 to manage their scouting and recruitment department			1
' @entity3 farewelled some of their biggest players , including @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , along with coach @entity104 to @entity0 in the off - season			1
but they 've rebuilt under @entity106 and sit a lofty second on the @entity35 ladder			0
the appointment could mean the end of @entity0 ’s technical director @entity27 's tenure at the club @entity27 , 54 , has been in his job since summer last year and oversaw player departures including @entity0 ’ best player and talisman @entity21 for a world record £ 86m			1
results have been mixed for the 13 faces brought in partly with the cash raised , from @entity121 to @entity30 to @entity37 and , more recently , @entity64 and @entity75			1
‘ @entity27 is pretty relaxed about the situation but he knows in football that people come and go and that he ’ll be moving on at some point , whenever that is , ’ said a source			1
@entity2 , 33 , follows @entity104 from @entity128 's to @entity29 where @entity3 players including @entity130 and @entity131 are highly coveted			1
@entity104 is the fifth permanent manager in seven years since @entity132 joined in 2007 and the @entity133 has been left a squad that is n't able to flourish under his high - tempo pressing system that so impressed in the south			0
spurs had lost three of their four league games leading up to sunday 's unconvincing three points over @entity141 that required a 90th minute winner from @entity53			0
@entity121 and @entity30 are among the players who have failed to impress since joining the club @entity0 's @entity145 has said his team - mates need time to adapt to @entity104 's style @entity104 's @entity0 climbed from 12th to 10th with a last - ditch win over @entity141 on sunday @entity0 fan @entity149 , who wrote the book taking our ball back , says the staff merri - go - round at @entity29 is hurting the club			1
‘ it ’s clear that there has been too much change in personnel recently , ’ he says of @entity0 ’ dilemma			1
‘ there ’s not much sense of team spirit evident when we play and no real leaders stand out			0
‘ there are lots of players with potential flair , perhaps fewer of the type who will dig in and help to hold a team together — therefore letting the flair players express themselves			0
‘ off the pitch , the phrase ‘ i ’ve never felt so disconnected from the club i support ’ keeps coming up			0
that ’s partly because of the discontent with the top level of football in this country but it ’s also because those running the club too often come across as aloof and as treating the fans as cash cows			0
