by @entity0 published : 03:40 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 03:53 est , 25 july 2013 @entity1 : the ' e-collar ' , favoured by celebrities including @entity4 actress @entity3 , are no more effective than traditional forms of dog training collars that give dogs electric shocks should be outlawed immediately after @entity11 research concluded they were no better for training dogs than traditional methods of reward			1
that is the view of the @entity17 in response to two reports commissioned by the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , which found they could actually cause harm to people 's pets rather than change their behaviour			1
the devices , used by @entity4 dog whisperer @entity26 and actress @entity3 , have already been banned in @entity29 and pressure is now mounting on ministers to extend this to the rest of the @entity34			0
the @entity17 is campaigning hard for action on the grounds the ' e-collars ' are cruel and harmful and has written to ministers calling for action			1
the controversial collars can deliver a shock lasting as long as 30 seconds			1
up to 500,000 @entity34 owners are said to use them			2
@entity17 secretary @entity44 argued the reports , which cost £ 540,000 , proved the devices hurt dogs and were less efficient than manufacturers claimed			2
she said : ' there is no denying the results of these two surveys			0
' action needs to be taken now to prevent further harm being done to the @entity34 's dogs			0
' even with industry trained professionals , and the project being conducted by an organisation ( @entity58 ) with a clear agenda , it was still found that electric shock collars often had a detrimental effect on dogs and did not prove to be a better alternative than training using positive reinforcement			2
' she added the devices failed to address underlying behaviour and could lead to further behaviour problems by training a dog to respond out of fear of further punishment rather than a natural willingness to obey			0
fan : @entity75 uses electric shock collars to help train neglected canines , although the @entity17 believes they are harmful good boy : traditional rewards work just as well as the punishment meted out by electric shocks dog training schools in the first of the two studies , scientists at the @entity85 of @entity86 and @entity87 , and the @entity88 , concluded the use of e – collars ' can lead to a negative impact on welfare at least in a proportionate ( number ) of animals trained using this technique '			1
it found that many owners used the devices without adhering to the instructions			0
cruel : electric collars , such as these pictured here , can emit shocks lasting 30 seconds the second follow – up study was conducted by the @entity87 team in conjunction with the @entity110 ( @entity58 )			1
it showed that the devices were no more effective than other methods of training , such as giving rewards for dogs who have problems chasing other animals , a common reason given for using shock collars			1
but @entity58 denied that the collars caused pain , although spokeswoman @entity124 admitted @entity20 officials had been in contact with its members since the publication of the reports			0
she told the @entity130 : ' @entity20 has approached @entity58 to ensure that its members ' products continue to be manufactured to set standards and to further educate users on how to operate the training products responsibly			0
' ' @entity58 members have signed up to a robust code of practice where all products meet the latest technical requirements and provide user guides with consistent instructions to improve the quality of lives of dogs while protecting animal welfare			0
' a spokesman for @entity20 said its research showed the collars ' cause no long – term harm to dog welfare when manufactured to a high standard and used appropriately ' but that those using the devices ' to inflict unnecessary suffering may be prosecuted under animal welfare laws ' .			2

@entity17 calls for controversial electric collars to be banned immediately
*government* research finds ' e-collars ' no more effective than rewards
the collars emit 30 - second shocks and are used by 500,000 owners
