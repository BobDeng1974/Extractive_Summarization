an elderly woman who fell from a bridge into a river below was heroically rescued by two passers - by who used a shirt as a rope to help pull her to safety			1
the woman was seen falling into the @entity9 during @entity11 's rush hour from the bridge between @entity13 and @entity14 , which is flanked by a stretch of waste ground			1
in a lucky twist , one of the two men who rushed to her aid yesterday evening was an off - duty train conductor who knew first aid and had the keys to the gate giving access to the fenced off wasteland			1
the drama unfolded at about 6.25pm when the woman , believed to be in her 60s , was spotted falling into the water			2
the two men raced down the steep riverbank after they saw the woman fall from the bridge above as they try to guide her out of the water , one of the men begins taking off his shirt he then uses it as a makeshift rope which the woman uses to pull herself towards the riverbank once she reaches the two rescuers , the man who took off his shirt helps haul her to safety the second rescuer happened to be off duty train conductor @entity49 ( left ) , who used his access keys for the adjacent wasteland to get her into a waiting ambulance she was heard to scream as her bag , containing her house keys and mobile phone , sunk in the water and she immediately began swimming			1
' i saw her fall from the side of the bridge and she just went straight down and started to cry out , ' said @entity63 , 43 , from @entity64 , who was in town visiting her daughter			1
' she was swimming a bit and then two men got over the fence and called to her to swim over			2
' one of the two men then removed his shirt and used it as a guide rope to pull her to safety			1
she said the woman was crying and appeared to be trembling from the cold			2
@entity49 , 35 , an off - duty conductor with @entity78 , said he helped the other man , who did not wish to be named , to pull the woman to safety			1
' she must have been in the water a good 10 minutes by the time we pulled her out			0
' she had started to swim towards the train viaduct and i was worried she would go under it , ' said mr @entity49 , who lives at the nearby @entity89 flats complex			0
' once we had her safe i checked that she was n't taking any medication or had drunk anything and we tried to get her into warm clothes			0
' the moment she fell i got on the phone to the emergency services and someone was on the scene quite quickly			0
' mr @entity49 , pictured left , said the woman was in the water for ' a good 10 minutes ' before she made it out while tending to her , he also sent his partner @entity104 , 37 , to their flat to get his work keys which gave them access to the gate closing off the wasteland			2
it meant that when paramedics arrived they were able to take her away to be checked over without having to climb the fence			0
mr @entity104 added : ' we only got back to @entity11 today from a two week holiday in @entity119 and were walking back from @entity120 after buying a few things to eat			0
' the woman seemed to be quite well - to - do and had a nice bag apparently containing her house keys and mobile phone			2
that went under soon after she fell in			0
' it 's such a shame			0
' a spokesman for @entity129 said officers had received a report of a woman falling into the @entity9 from a city centre bridge at 6.23pm			1
' a passerby had managed to get her out of the water by the time we were on the scene			0
she was wet and in shock and was conveyed to the @entity140 by ambulance			1
