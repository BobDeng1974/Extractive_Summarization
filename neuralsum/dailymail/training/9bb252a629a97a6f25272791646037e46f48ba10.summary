a conservationist embroiled in a multi-million pound court battle with her estranged husband over funds from the charity they set up with the aim of saving endangered @entity9 tigers had become ' blinded by her desire for revenge ' , a judge has said			1
sir @entity12 , sitting in the @entity13 of the @entity13 in @entity14 , said that desire had led @entity16 - a ' very intelligent person ' - to ' fabricate where she thinks it will assist her case '			1
the judge was giving his findings in a round of a legal fight between ms @entity25 , a @entity9 conservationist , and former banker @entity27 - who are both in their 50s and live in @entity14 , which followed the collapse of their marriage			1
ms @entity25 told the judge during proceedings earlier this year that money put into the @entity37 charity was used to fund their personal lives			1
@entity40 claimed that money put into the @entity37 charity was used to fund the personal lives of her and her husband former banker @entity27			1
a divorce judge said she was ' blinded by her desire for revenge ' the judge said @entity40 was ' passionate ' about not only saving the @entity9 tiger from ' disappearing from the planet altogether ' mr @entity27 , who comes from @entity49 and used to work for @entity50 , hotly disputed her case that a trust was established not only to advance the cause of the tigers , but also to provide financial benefit and support for the husband and wife personally over the long term			1
in a written ruling , sir @entity12 said today that there was ' no evidence of past , present or future benefit to the parties '			2
he said the trust has assets ' which are worth tens of millions of dollars or pounds '			2
the precise figure ' is far from agreed , but on the most optimistic view not more than Â£ 25m , but there are now almost no assets , relatively speaking , outside it '			0
the judge added : ' accordingly , the determination of this preliminary issue necessarily has a profound impact on the wife 's claim			1
' the couple lived together from 1997 , marrying in 2001			0
in 2000 ms @entity25 established @entity37 in the @entity79			0
file picture giving the background to the case , the judge said the wife was ' passionate ' about not only saving the @entity9 tiger from ' disappearing from the planet altogether ' , but also breeding them for reintroduction into wild reserves in @entity91 - the @entity9 tiger ( panthera tigris amoyensis ) no longer exists in the wild			1
he added : ' to that end she has invested huge amounts of time and energy and some money			0
' she met mr @entity27 in 1990 and ' he too , over time , became infected with the same passion for the cause of saving the @entity9 tiger '			1
the judge said : ' and he too has invested even greater sums of money in the venture , loosely and frequently described as the @entity106 , and a great deal of his time and energy			1
' the couple lived together from 1997 , marrying in 2001			0
in 2000 ms @entity25 established @entity37 in the @entity79 ( @entity37 @entity79 ) , which secured @entity112 registration the following year			0
' between that time and july 2012 the husband and wife worked tirelessly and more or less cooperatively on this patently bold , imaginative , charitable and laudable venture ' , said the judge			1
sir @entity12 continued : ' the wife 's expertise in the field of tiger conservation and her @entity9 contacts and cultural background combined with the husband 's profound understanding of , and experience in , complicated international finance and financial structures undoubtedly produced a dynamic partnership			2
' but he said : ' tragically for all involved the personal relationship of the wife and husband deteriorated over time			2
part of the problem seems to have been disagreements over the future policy and precise presentation of the project			0
' sir @entity12 said that in july 2012 the wife was removed as director of @entity37 @entity79 and the following month filed a divorce petition			2
he said : ' from the word go the wife has been beside herself with grief and anger at the way that she has been unjustifiably , as she sees it , removed from @entity37 @entity79 and the @entity148 project which she has always seen as ' her baby '			0
' she has gone as far as saying that if she can not lead the project she would rather it was destroyed			0
' she has since her departure set up another charity with similar objectives and which the husband believes is an attempt to try and usurp @entity37 @entity79 's function			1
' the judge said he was ' driven ' to find ' overall ' that ' she is an unreliable witness upon whom the court can not rely '			2
that was ' especially so ' when it came to deciding where the ' truth lies ' about the underlying purpose of the trust ' and any discussion which took place at the time of its creation '			0
sir @entity12 said : ' the wife is a very intelligent person but she has become blinded by her desire for revenge and this has led her to fabricate where she thinks it will assist her case			1
' he said that in contrast , he found the husband 's evidence ' bore all conventional hallmarks of honesty and accuracy '			0
in a statement issued after the decision , ms @entity25 said : ' i am surprised and disappointed by the now retired judge 's decision			2
' i want to ask the @entity189 to right this wrong			0
' it is a terrible precedent			0
however as there will probably be an appeal , i am advised that it would be inappropriate for me to comment any further at this time			0

the pair set up a conservation charity to *protect* endangered big cats
she claimed he used cash from the charity to *pay* for their personal lives
but a judge says @entity40 has ' fabricated ' claims to assist her case
