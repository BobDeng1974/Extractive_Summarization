researchers are investigating whether a simple eye test could be used to identify the early stages of alzheimer ’s disease			1
a three - year £ 1.1 million project will look at whether warning signs can be detected using special computer software to analyse high - definition images of the eye			1
evidence suggests that changes in the patterns of ocular veins and arteries can be linked to other disease such as stroke and cardiovascular disease			1
researchers are examining whether an eye test may be able to point out the early signs of dementia ( file image ) a team at the @entity24 ’s school of computing have developed the software - known as @entity26 - with colleagues at the @entity28			1
project co-ordinator @entity29 , professor of computational vision at the @entity24 , said : ' if you can look into someone ’s eyes using an inexpensive machine and discover something which may suggest a risk of developing dementia , then that ’s a very interesting proposition			2
' there is the promise of early warning in a non-invasive way and there is also the fact that we even might be able to use the test to differentiate between different types of dementia			0
' researchers will compare measurements of thousands of images with medical histories stored at @entity55 ’s @entity54 to see if a relationship can be established			0
mr @entity29 said : ' when changes occur in some parts of the body , you can see differences in the retinal vessels , e.g. in width , some vessels become thinner ; some become larger ; differences in the tortuosity , or how wriggly the vessels become ; there are also differences in the angles when vessels split in two			0
researchers believe the tests could help diagnose dementia , among other ailments , sooner ( file image ) ' these measurements can indicate a huge amount but to take them by hand is an extremely time - consuming , tedious process			2
' @entity83 software interface allows researchers to take these measures repeatedly , reliably , and efficiently even when working with a large number of images			1
' the @entity87 ( @entity88 ) has funded the project as part an £ 8 million investment in research at 11 @entity94 universities			0
professor @entity95 , @entity88 ’s chief executive , said , ' the @entity94 faces a huge challenge over the coming decades , we have an ageing population and a likely rise in the numbers of people suffering from dementias			0
' these research projects will improve our abilities to detect and understand dementias and how the disease progresses			0

three - year project will examine whether signs can be detected in eye tests

vein patterns may also be linked to stroke and cardiovascular diseases
