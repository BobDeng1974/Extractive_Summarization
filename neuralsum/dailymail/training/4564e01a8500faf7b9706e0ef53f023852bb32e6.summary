the two @entity1 women accused of attempting to smuggle cocaine worth £ 1.5 million out of @entity3 have been branded liars by the lawyer who prepared the preliminary case against them			1
and he says their refusal to confess increases their prospect of facing 15 years in prison			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity16 , dr @entity12 , head of the state attorney ’s office anti-drugs unit , dismissed the women ’s stories			1
the lawyer , who led the investigation for the first 15 days , said that @entity22 and @entity21 , both 20 , had no proof to back up any of their claims			1
last week @entity16 printed the women ’s police statements in full and revealed that miss @entity22 ’s father , @entity38 , thinks she should plead guilty			1
dr @entity12 said : ‘ they do n’t even have one element of proof			1
unfortunately , their stories are not believable – their stories are incredible			1
they staged this whole thing from the beginning because they knew it was possible they would get caught and if they did get caught they had the excuses really well planned			1
‘ the problem is that they received the drugs , they packed the drugs in their bags and they went to the airport			1
but had they been given the bags packed already – which is what usually happens – then it ’s another story			1
when somebody is threatened , you can tell			1
i have spoken to the girls and their demeanour did not suggest that they had been threatened because of the way they acted			1
’ dr @entity12 questioned the women for three hours and thinks they will end up pleading guilty to get a shorter sentence			1
dr @entity71 , head of the state attorney 's office anti-drugs unit , is interviewed by reporter @entity74 he added : ‘ it ’s very obvious that they were trained in what to say if they were caught			1
they were prepared in every sense			2
they were told to take pictures of themselves having a good time , to try to act as normal as possible			2
all of the excuses were very well practised			1
’ this comes as @entity16 has uncovered fresh information about the women ’s capture at @entity89 : @entity21 ( @entity90 ) and @entity22 ( r ) were detained allegedly with 11 kilograms of cocaine on their way to @entity94 , @entity95 , at the international airport @entity97 in @entity98 , near @entity24 , @entity3 the case is now in the hands of the judiciary , but dr @entity12 has been privy to all the evidence in the first 15 days of the case			1
his remarks provide a stark assessment of the women ’s hopes of proving their innocence			1
if they continue to plead not guilty they will receive a minimum of eight and maximum of 15 years behind bars , he warns			2
‘ the biggest part , for me , was when they started crying when i asked them about their families , ’ he said			2
‘ there ’s no way in the world they would risk their families ’ safety for that many days when they could have come forward and told the authorities they ’d been threatened			2
‘ they are going to end up pleading guilty to get the minimum sentence , that ’s what they always end up doing in my experience			2
’ he added : ‘ when they were first questioned , their demeanour was very flat and they were just repeating their story			2
usually when a mule is caught they come out with lots of different stories and explanations – they have lots of detail			2
these girls ’ stories were just too superficial			2
‘ they could have come forward before			2
they had the opportunities to			2
the authorities in this country and their country would have done everything that was necessary to protect their families and to make sure nothing happened to them			0
‘ if that had happened , they actually would have had the opportunity to catch the real people involved because they would have done whatever was necessary to catch the real bosses			0
but they did n’t do that			0
they waited to be caught			0
’ dr @entity12 also ruled out the possibility that the women were sacrificed to let a bigger load of drugs though , explaining that once the girls had been caught all flights were put on high alert			1
he added that @entity173 showing the girls ’ movements just before they went to the airport ‘ showed nobody was holding a gun to their head ’			0
‘ no one was seen to force them to do anything , ’ he said			0
‘ they may have been used to carry drugs but they may also have been offered compensation for it because they were just freely walking around			1
’ joke : @entity22 has poured her heart out in a series of letters to friends at home @entity22 has poured her heart out in a series of letters to friends at home , describing her nightmare ordeal in a squalid @entity3 prison			0
but she has managed to keep her sense of humour and was able to joke : ‘ hope i look good on tv ! ( as good as i can that is			0
) ’ @entity203 has spent her first full week behind bars with @entity21 in a grim prison alongside murderers and terrorists			0
she describes the experience as ‘ frustrating and scary ’ but is ‘ taking it one day at a time ’			0
@entity22 tells friends that @entity21 , from @entity210 , is ‘ like a sister to me now ’			0
writing to friends at home in @entity214 from @entity216 prison , @entity22 says : ‘ makes me sick to think i was meant to still be having the summer of a lifetime in @entity218 [ @entity220 ] baby but instead i am in a woman ’s prison in @entity3			0
i suppose it has n’t quite hit home			0
’ after complaining that she misses her mother ’s cooking , @entity22 describes to another friend how she witnessed a hungry inmate sucking chicken bones , calling it ‘ a different ball game ’			0
at the prison , the women undergo a military - style regime			1
there is a head count at 6am , the inmates are locked in their cells from 6pm and lights go out at 9pm			0
@entity22 and @entity21 face up to three years there while they await trial			0
they are forced to take cold showers , which often cut out , and are confined to their cell most of the day			1
they are kept isolated from the main prison population while officials monitor their progress			0
writing to her friends , @entity22 said : ‘ i am taking it day by day			0
it ’s too hard to look at the long term as i will drive myself insane ! ’ to another friend she wrote : ‘ if it was someone i knew in this position i would set up like a petition for @entity258 or something ? i do n’t know if it will help but surely it will put pressure on them ! i just wish we were back having the summer of our lives everything is so f * * * * d up now ! ’ she added : ‘ my 21st [ birthday ] will be in a @entity3 prison ahhh ! ! ! ! ’ the pair could spend up to three years in jail in @entity3 as they await their trial last night , @entity22 ’s father , @entity38 , bid an emotional goodbye to his daughter as he prepared to fly back to @entity1			1
breaking down in tears , @entity22 told him : ‘ i ’m going to find it so hard not knowing when i ’ll next see you or @entity279			0
’ mr @entity203 said : ‘ i think prison has been a reality check for them both			0
they now know that this is going to be where they ’re going to spend a considerable period of time			0
‘ @entity22 has always been looking forward to my next visit but when i ’m gone , she ’ll not know when she ’ll see her family again			0
‘ i ’ve tried to explain to her why i think she should plead guilty			0
she is guilty of transporting drugs , but she can say she ’s sorry for those actions and the hurt and misery it ’s brought to her family			1
she ’s just got to take the medicine that goes with that and move on			0
