the number of @entity1 – traditional @entity3 female entertainers who act as hostesses – may have declined since the 1800s			0
but more people could enjoy the company and musical skills of such hostesses , if @entity12 ’s realistic @entity11 robot , unveiled at the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) in @entity14 , catches on			1
like a geisha , the robotic hostess named @entity11 is designed to make conversation , sing and could one day play classical music or look after people			1
' her ' unnervingly smooth and silent body movements are created using 43 pneumatic actuators including 24 in its shoulders , arms and hands and 15 in the face			1
robotic hostess @entity11 ( pictured ) can talk , sing and gesticulate to welcome humans the @entity3 firm told @entity34 that its aim is to create ‘ real heart - warming communication with human - like facial expression ’ with its realistic , conservatively dressed android			1
@entity12 claims its creation has the most realistic facial expressions of any android			1
' her ' unnervingly smooth and silent body movements are created using 43 pneumatic actuators including 24 in its shoulders , arms and hands and 15 in the face			1
this technology is needed to reflect the robot ’s emotions , as it can reportedly be happy , irritated or sad – and even cry			1
@entity11 is the latest member of @entity12 ’s ‘ human smart community ’ – a group of robots designed to lead to smarter living			1
in the future , the company envisions that such robots could look after the elderly , work as nurses or waitresses , meaning that they could one day put humans out of a job			1
@entity11 is not the only android that could replace humans			2
chillingly life - like robots are causing a storm in @entity3 , where their creators are about to launch them as actresses , full - size mechanical copies for pop idol fans , and clones of the dearly departed			2
there is even talk that the naturalistic , she - droids may be taken up as men as partners in the not - too - distant future			1
android @entity78 was a star attraction at @entity81 ’ week showcase in november and is one of a series of ' geminoids ' , as their inventor dubs them , that are ripe for commercialisation say their creator robotics professor @entity88			2

@entity11 ( left ) is a member of @entity12 ’s ‘ human smart community ’ – a group of robots designed to lead to smarter living			1
' she ' could one day perhaps learn to play a classical instrument like a real @entity1 ( right ) the prospect of robot overlords , friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years			2
but according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness , emotional machines will never exist			0
this is because computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling , one expert claims			0
a mathematical framework for consciousness , developed over the last decade by @entity120 at the @entity121 , shows that computers can not handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly			0
this means , if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information , computers ca n’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans			0
‘ she ’ is so convincing that many people bowed respectfully before requesting politely to take her photo or join a selfie at the event			0
while the robot currently relies on a hidden camera and a human operator to give her life , a fully independent version is expected in 10 years using artificial intelligence , face and voice recognition			2
@entity78 has silicon skin covering animatronic muscles that move her eyes and power her expressions			0
' she ' has appeared on stage and in an opera and could become a pop star			0
already @entity3 is in thrall to virtual idols such as @entity159 , who is basically a hologram that ' sings ' words and music created for her on a computer using ' vocaloid ' technology			0
her tunes often outsell those sung by her flesh and blood musical rivals in @entity3			0
and as well as robotic news readers , realistic sex dolls are now available			0
costing around £ 6,000 , they have moveable eyes , flexible fingers and realistically textured skin			0
one of the manufacturers , called @entity179 , said : ' it is not inconceivable that we will be making android life partners in the near future			2
' in the future , @entity12 envisions that @entity185 and other similar robots could look after the elderly , work as nurse or as a waitress , meaning that she could one day put humans out of a job			1
