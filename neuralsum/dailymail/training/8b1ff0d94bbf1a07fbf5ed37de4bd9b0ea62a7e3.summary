by @entity0 @entity1 may have plans to launch the first privately manned space flight this year , but at $ 250,000 a ticket , @entity5 space travel wo n’t come cheap			1
for those desperate to get a taste of the experience , @entity7 ( @entity8 ) has just launched what it claims will be the world 's cheapest @entity14 flights			2
with prices starting at € 2,000 ( £ 1,600 ; $ 2,700 ) , the flight will see passengers experience 20 to 25 seconds of weightlessness each time the plane transitions from climbing to descending			1
@entity8 's flights , like existing @entity14 services , will involve putting passengers aboard a modified aircraft that performs a series of mid-air parabolas - or u-shaped manoeuvres @entity8 's flights , like existing @entity14 services , will involve putting passengers aboard a modified aircraft that performs a series of mid-air parabolas – or u-shaped manoeuvres			1
this gives passengers a feeling of weightlessness for just over six minutes in total , allowing them to feel similar sensations to that of an astronaut floating on the @entity44			2
@entity45 puts its astronauts through a much tougher version of the same flights as part of their training , pushing trainees to the brink of sickness in what is described as the ' vomit comet			0
' each aircraft will perform 15 parabolas per 90 - minute			1
for a price of under € 2,000 ( £ 1,600 or $ 2,700 ) , passengers will get put into something known as the ‘ @entity61 ’ with 39 other people			1
@entity45 and @entity63 put their astronauts through much tougher versions of the same flights as part of their training , pushing trainees to the brink of nausea in what is described as the ' vomit comet ' zero gravity results in a sense of weightlessness , allowing bodies and materials to move completely freely			0
it can be achieved by going into deep space , far from any gravitational body such as planets and stars			0
a cheaper option is to take a parabolic @entity83 involves putting passengers aboard a modified aircraft that performs a series of mid-air parabolas – or u-shaped manoeuvres			1
combined , these maneouvres give passengers a feeling of weightlessness for just over six minutes , allowing them to feel similar sensations to that of an astronaut floating on the @entity44			2

’ for those willing to pay € 5,000 ( £ 4,050 or $ 6,800 ) , passengers join 27 other people in the ‘ @entity103 ’ which includes items to play with like balloons and liquid			1
a dozen passengers can have a ‘ tailor - made experience ’ in the @entity109 , which will cost an € 50,000 ( £ 40,500 or $ 68,000 ) and comes with a watch and a flight suit			1
@entity8 plans on starting the flights in @entity113 next january for anyone above the age of eight , with 14 other locations opening throughout the year			2
earlier this year , the @entity118 group unveiled radical plans to launch a space shuttle from the top of an @entity123 passenger jet as part of a separate project			0
@entity7 said the system will be a far cheaper way to launch satellites - and claims it can sell launches for £ 7 million ( $ 12 million ) or around a quarter of the price currently charged			1
the firm claims its system , which could launch satellites weighing up to 550lbs ( 250kg ) , could take to the air in 2017			0
the @entity7 launch model uses an @entity136 , an aircraft already certified for zero gravity flights , to take the shuttle up to 10,000m on its back			0
once it reaches this height , the shuttle will be launched to take it to an altitude of 49.7 miles ( 80km ) , when the spaceplane doors open and put the satellites into orbit			0
when this operation has been completed , the shuttle will return to earth by gliding towards its launch airport - and can be reused			0
@entity1 may be moving ahead with plans to launch the first privately manned space flight , but at $ 250,000 ( £ 148,400 ) a ticket , space travel won ¿ t come cheap			1

prices start at € 2,000 ( £ 1,600 / $ 2,700 ) and first flight will take off from @entity113
in *comparison* , a ticket for @entity5 's @entity159 costs $ 250,000 ( £ 148,400 )
each aircraft will perform 15 manoeuvres throughout the 90 - minute flight
during manoeuvres , passengers experience 25 seconds of weightlessness
