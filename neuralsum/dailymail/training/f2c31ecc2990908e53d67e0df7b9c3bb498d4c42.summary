from road accidents to military attacks , it is thought that a third of people who survive a terrifying experience have post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity6 )			1
there is now hope that in the future , a simple pill or nasal spray containing a natural stress - relieving chemical , called neuropeptide y ( @entity14 ) , could help survivors recover from stress faster and become less fearful and anxious			1
the drug could also be used to make soldiers more resilient in battle situations , experts say			1
a simple pill or nasal spray containing a natural stress - relieving chemical , could once day help @entity6 survivors recover from stress faster and become less fearful and anxious			1
the drug could also be used to make soldiers more resistant in battle situations , experts say			1
a stock image of a soldier under stress is pictured scientists from @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity36 in @entity37 , are studying the effects of acute stress on the human body at the @entity43 army ’s ‘ survival school ’ called @entity44 in @entity45			1
there , soldiers are subjected to mock interrogations and other scary situations , @entity46 reported			0
professors @entity50 and @entity52 tested soldiers before and after the mock interrogations and discovered that a chemical called @entity14 ( @entity14 ) was produced in the brain when they coped with extreme stress			1
scientists are testing the effects of stress on soldiers who undergo mock interrogations ( illustrated with a stock image ) at ‘ survival school ’ soldiers with higher levels of @entity14 coped better under pressure			2
and overall , all of the special forces troops , who are known for working in particularly stressful environments , had more of the chemical than regular soldiers			2
the chemical is triggered by stress and helps to repress the release of noradrenaline – a hormone that is involved in the flight - or - fight response			0
the scientists think that higher levels of @entity14 enable people to recover from stress faster and help them be more resilient under pressure			2
animal tests have revealed that doses of the chemical can reduce fear and anxiety , while genetic studies suggest that people with a form of @entity14 gene are less prone to worrying			2
professor @entity50 believes that by understanding the role of @entity14 better , experts could unlock the secret of resilience			0
his team has developed an @entity14 nasal spray to give @entity6 patients a low dose of the drug , having gained permission from the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) in spring to test it on people			1
while he said that a low dose does not appear to produce any noticeable benefits , the team is now giving @entity6 sufferers higher doses and hopes to be able to share their its findings by next spring			0
the scientists have high hopes because a study on mice in 2013 showed that seven days after the animals were put through a traumatic experience , they were given a high dose of @entity14 and showed fewer signs of depression and anxiety afterwards than untreated mice			0
post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity6 ) is an anxiety caused by very stressful or frightening events			1
they may include military combat , terrorist attacks , assault , natural disasters , road accidents or witnessing violent deaths			0
@entity6 can develop immediately after a disturbing event , or can emerge months or years later			0
it 's thought that one in three people who have a traumatic experience are affected by @entity6 , @entity133 say			2
sufferers often relive the event through nightmares or flashbacks and can feel isolated , frightened or guilty			0
symptoms , including difficulty sleeping , can be persistent and severe enough to impact on a person 's day - to - day life			0
@entity6 is currently treated with cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity144 ) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing ( @entity148 ) as well as antidepressant medication .			0

a pill or nasal spray could help treat post-traumatic stress disorder in future
it contains a chemical called @entity14 ( @entity14 ) that is produced in the brain to help people cope with extremely stressful situations
drug could also make soldiers more resilient in pressurised battle situations
it 's being developed by scientists at @entity33 in @entity35 and the @entity36 in @entity37
drug is being tested on @entity6 patients and results are *expected* in spring
