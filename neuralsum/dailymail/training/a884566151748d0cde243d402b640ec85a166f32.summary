by @entity0 last updated at 3:40 pm on 4th november 2011 a 72 - year - old man who inherited the fortune of a partner 22 years his senior is set to lose their home and much of her cash – because they were not married			1
wheelchair - bound @entity10 shared @entity12 ’s home for 15 years and acted as her sole carer in the three years before she died			1
but a court heard the ‘ toy boy ’ , who is now seeing a 30 - year - old woman , faces having to sell the semi-detached property to pay a £ 100,000 legal bill after losing a court battle over a £ 61,000 cheque mrs @entity12 paid him a week before her death			1
' toy boy ' : @entity10 shared @entity12 's home for 15 years and acted as her sole carer in the three years before she died			1
he is set to lose the home and money he inherited because they were not married new partner : 72 - year - old mr @entity10 is now in a relationship with 30 - year - old @entity30 in a case which sounds a warning to unmarried couples , the @entity31 was told yesterday that when mrs @entity12 died in october 2003 , she left mr @entity10 her home in @entity36 , then worth £ 150,000 , its contents , her car and £ 28,000 in cash			1
the remainder of her estate was to be split between the @entity42 and the @entity43			0
but after mr @entity10 , a retired architect who is now seeing a 30 - year - old known as @entity30 , had taken his portion , it emerged there was nothing left for the charities			1
the executor of mrs @entity12 ’s estate queried the cheque payment and , with the charities ’ backing , launched a @entity55 fight to get the cash sum repaid			2
in march , judge @entity57 accepted that mr @entity10 had treated the ‘ intelligent and financially aware ’ former company secretary ‘ in every way as a gentleman ’ , but ruled in the executor ’s favour and ordered the repayment of the cash			2
the judge said mr @entity10 had a forceful personality and added that , even if the money had been a gift , it was invalidated by ‘ undue influence ’			2
yesterday the pensioner - who needs a wheelchair after suffering two strokes following his partner ’s death - failed in a bid to overturn the ruling at the @entity31			1
charity battle : mr @entity10 shared @entity12 's home in @entity36 for 15 years and acted as her sole carer in the three years before she died			1
he may now have to sell the property to cover the charities legal bills - estimated at £ 100,000 now , as well paying back the £ 61,000 , mr @entity10 may lose his home to cover the charities ’ legal bills - estimated at £ 100,000 - although enforcement of the order could be delayed until after his death			1
his barrister @entity89 told the @entity91 court that , had the couple been man and wife , the venerable legal ‘ presumption of advancement ’ - which assumes that cash and property transfers between close family members are outright gifts - would have applied			1
but , because mr @entity10 was not formally married to his benefactor , the opposite presumption - that the £ 61,000 was a repayable loan - held sway with judge @entity57			1
mr @entity89 argued that the ‘ presumption that the money was a loan applied to strangers ’ and was of ‘ no application in a domestic context ’			0
he added : ‘ the judge has put the cart before the horse			0
no part of this presumption has any place in a domestic transaction			0
‘ the payment of a cheque from one long - term co-habitee to another should not be subject to the same assumptions as a commercial transaction			2
‘ he did all , or almost all , the work in their common household and looked after her in her illness			0
she made all , or almost all , the payments in the household including substantial payments to him from time to time			0
’ the court heard the couple got together in 1985 when mr @entity10 was 46 and mrs @entity12 was 68			1
he moved into her home in @entity136 , @entity36 , three years later			2
ruling against mr @entity10 , @entity137 said : ‘ the law presumes , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , that the payment of money implies an obligation to repay it			2
‘ the long term , loving , supporting , relationship - which judge @entity57 was perfectly willing to accept - was not sufficient in his view to explain the transaction as a gift			2
’ he said the high court judge had ‘ assessed the credibility of the witnesses and found on the balance of probabilities that mrs @entity12 did n't intend it as an outright gift			0
’ @entity43 legacy administration manager @entity158 said : ' we welcome the @entity55 ’s decision to fulfil the charitable wishes of the late @entity12			0
' over a third of @entity43 ’s lifesaving work into the prevention , diagnosis and treatment of cancer is funded through gifts in @entity169			0
' in only a small number of cases are there any disputes and , for the most part , the family and loved ones of the deceased are happy for the contents of the will to be carried out			0
' we are very grateful to mrs @entity12 for choosing to remember us in her will			0
' @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity42 said : ' we are pleased the @entity55 had ruled in our favour and has chosen to respect the wishes of the late @entity12			0
' we are always grateful to everyone who chooses to remember us in their will and support our work in the fight against heart disease			0
