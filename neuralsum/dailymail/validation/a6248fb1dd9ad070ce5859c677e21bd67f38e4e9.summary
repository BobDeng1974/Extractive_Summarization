imagine playing a game of @entity1 with a group of @entity4 students who are unable to recognise the @entity5 , the @entity6 or the @entity7			1
welcome to the parallel universe of @entity9 , where some of the hermit kingdom 's brightest young minds have a lack of worldly knowledge which would shame a @entity15 primary school student			1
in 2011 writer and journalist @entity16 went undercover for two terms teaching @entity19 at the @entity20 , just outside the capital of the world 's most secretive country			1
one student once asked her if it was true everyone in the world spoke @entity9			1
portraits of @entity37 and @entity28 hang on the wall above the blackboard posing as one of the @entity42 missionaries running the facility , miss @entity16 spent months secretly documenting her experiences for a book , ' without you , there is no @entity48 : my secret life teaching the sons of @entity9 's elite '			1
the 270 boys aged 19 - 20 were the offspring of some of the regime 's most loyal citizens - some of the few allowed to live in the capital outside of which the vast majority are stuck in grinding poverty in the countryside			1
their new teacher was getting up at 5am every day to write - up notes she had taken on her experiences , making sure she copied everything to five usb sticks and left nothing on her laptop which could be spied on by her hosts			1
if miss @entity16 , then aged 40 , had been caught , she risked being branded a spy and being thrown in one of @entity9 's gulags , or forced labour camps , where 120,000 political prisoners are thought to be held			1
every piece of material for every lesson had to be submitted and approved for use by a shadowy group known as the ' counterparts ' - @entity9 staff overseeing the lessons of the foreign teachers who had been brought in			2
students on a cold and snowy day after an exam , with the @entity87 in the background miss @entity16 wrote her book ( left ) after months of secret note - taking			1
the @entity91 in @entity92 ( right ) an enclosed walkway that connects all buildings at the @entity20 campus , including the classroom building on the left			2
a @entity92 smokestack belches fumes in the distance by miss @entity16 's second week the counterparts had approved various games , including trivia contents , spelling competitions and @entity1			2
and yet , for @entity9 's best and brightest , ' photos of the @entity106 , the @entity5 and the @entity6 of @entity107 elicited only blank expressions '			1
they knew about @entity110 from their previous universities , but had no idea how @entity113 and the website he created , @entity115 , had revolutionised the way the rest of the world communicated			1
miss @entity16 wrote : ' a few guessed the names of the @entity7 and @entity121 , but only after much hemming and hawing			1
' hardly anyone knew what country had first landed men on the moon , despite the fact that they were science and technology majors			2
' asked what year computers had been invented , most had no idea ; it was only after much consultation that one team ventured a guess : 1870			0
' miss @entity16 told @entity136 : ' in a way , why would they know ? they have never been taught about the outside world			1
three uniformed students on guard duty outside the it building			0
the sign reads : ' @entity143 of the @entity144 , general @entity28 ' students on sports day with the @entity148 to the right , on which is inscribed ' our great @entity150 is always with @entity48 ' students often watched from their dormitory windows while miss @entity16 practiced playing basketball below ' they did n't even know about the existence of the internet			1
there is only one tv channel about the @entity37 and one newspaper about the @entity37 [ @entity9 ' term for @entity37 , the country 's founder and first leader , who is considered to be immortal and the country 's ' eternal president ' ]			1
' but on another level they were the elite			0
if any of them did know more the fear and the consequences of being exposed were so great they never let it be known			0
' one student asked miss @entity16 if it were true that everyone in the world spoke @entity9 , as it was ' so superior that they spoke it in @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity48			1
' many of the boy 's families lived as little as 10 minutes drive away in @entity92 , but they were hardly ever allowed to see them or have any contact at all during term time			0
one student 's father stopped by the campus to see him but was turned away and all he could do was leave a note			0
another was late for lunch one day because his mother had come to the gate with rice cakes and roast chicken as it was his birthday			0
miss @entity16 wrote : ' he was an only child , and she wept during their twenty - minute meeting , so he told her , " if you keep crying , i am going to go back inside			2
" ' he was laughing as he said this before his friends , but his eyes watered			0
' miss @entity16 in the classroom with the lyrics of a @entity9 song which she translated with her students eating instant ramen outside the @entity210 on a rare outing all the students wore lapel pins featuring the face of @entity37			1
even during the bitterly cold winter months , groups of six students at a time dressed in martial uniforms were expected to stand guard all night outside the campus 's hulking grey @entity87			2
it is where they went to study @entity225 , @entity37 's pseudo philosophy of self reliance , and many performed such duties outside similar halls in the areas they grew up in since they were teenagers			1
miss @entity16 is unnerved by the extent to which her students lied , be it about the myriad achievements of @entity28 , the country 's ' dear leader ' at the time , or what they had been up to that morning			1
she said : ' it 's a whole world of lies			2
coming from a world where everything is a lie in some ways it 's just been ingrained but they also lie because they are constantly being watched			2
' the system has an absolute hold			0
they lie to protect the system from the outside and also out of fear			0
' they were lovely at the same time and also very sincere but their system is a system built on lies			0
' a highlight of miss @entity16 's time at @entity20 was when she fought successfully so that one of her classes could watch @entity259			1
students taking part in their final exam			0
one class was ecstatic at being allowed to watch @entity264 the sign on this building in the capital reads ' we are happy '			0
@entity92 was only around 10 minutes drive from @entity20 , but students were never allowed out to visit their families during term time she said : ' they loved it			2
most of them had never seen a @entity15 film			0
they related to @entity278 and @entity279 and saw that they were " just like us ; in school like us ; with homework to do like us "			0
' that i found very moving			0
they were never allowed to see the outside world and be exposed to a world that is n't about the @entity37			1
' it was probably the first time they related to @entity15 people in a normal way			0
' but miss @entity16 does not see much hope for the international pariah state opening up to the world any time soon , given what she saw of its system			2
she said : ' i hope that things will open up even a tiny bit so the boys would be able to find out about my book - that 's my biggest wish			1
' but i am not that hopeful for real change because the amount of control i saw there was so absolute and so brutal , with no mercy			0
' i thought the elites had it a better than everyone else			0
on the other hand they may have a had a bit more food and a bit more electricity but no one is spared in @entity9 from the control of the military dictatorship			2
' they are never allowed to move about freely in the country or exchange information			0
i do n't see how they can rise up			2
' i think change has to come from the outside somehow because i do n't know what they can do from the inside			0
' i really loved them and it broke my heart to see them living in that way , in that place			0
' it was really a gulag , nothing else			0
it is the most inhuman thing , controlling people with fear			0
' ' without you , there is no @entity48 ' by @entity16 is published by @entity344 , priced £ 8.99			1

@entity16 , a @entity9 - @entity48 journalist , taught for two terms at @entity347 while pretending to be a @entity42 missionary
would rise at 5am to take notes for her book ***‘*** without you , there is no @entity48 ***’*** , keeping everything on usb sticks so she would not be discovered
the 270 boys at @entity20 were the country 's brightest but had no idea what @entity115 is and ca n***’***t recognise the @entity5 or the @entity7
they wear lapel pins of the country ***’***s founding president , @entity37 , and must guard his *sacred* ***‘*** study hall ***’*** *overnight* even in the *freezing* cold
a viewing of ***‘*** @entity259 ***’*** is such a *novelty* as they are ' never exposed to a world that is n't about the @entity37 '
