updated : 08:39 est , 14 september 2011 with her long blonde hair and healthy tan @entity0 would n't look out of place in @entity4			1
so it is little wonder that the 29 - year - old is causing a stir in the real world of football			1
but she is not the latest squeeze of some millionaire @entity14 star - the politics graduate has become the the youngest ceo in @entity18 football after being appointed to the board of @entity20			1
youth beauty and experience : at 29 years old , ms still becomes the youngest in the country to hold such a high role in football young , female and attractive , @entity0 - former high flyer in the luxury fashion industry and now brand new chief executive of the @entity31 club - is a rare breed in the male - dominated world of football			1
but armed with a knowledge of business acquired in the cut - throat fashion industry , still is adamant she is more than woman enough to fill the role			1
still , who has held executive roles at luxury brands @entity43 and @entity44 , says she will draw on her fashion past to improve the fortunes of the club			1
' working in that industry i 've absorbed a lot of useful information , ' she says			2
' strategies can be utilised from fashion to football			1
it 's business at the end of the day			2
' outnumbered : as @entity60 vice-chairman , @entity56 , far right , with the club 's owners , is one of the few women to hold top flight roles in the industry on the ball : @entity56 was just 23 when she was appointed managing director at @entity66 ' it 's a great privilege for me to be offered the chance to lead this football club , ' said @entity71 still on her appointment			1
' i intend to add vibrancy and fresh ideas to our approach off the field			2
' @entity71 still has promised to do her best to bring success back to the @entity80 team , whose 77 - year stay in the @entity82 came to an end in 2008			2
' i want to wake sleeping fans with a lot of different initiatives by liaising with them and finding what they want , ' she said			2
she added : ' we have a fantastic team both on and off the field and i am pleased to accept this role during a time when there appears to be a real buzz around the place			2
' unsurprisingly , her appointment has been compared to that of @entity60 vice-chairman @entity56 , who at the age of 23 was made managing director of @entity66			0
' i do see a correlation , ' says still			0
' @entity56 is steely , determined and , at the end of the day , she turned around a football club that was n't doing very well that is now doing extremely well			1
in her wisdom , still admits that although her business acumen landed her the job , an unusual appointment - in this case , of a young , attractive woman to a top - flight football position - is nevertheless a shrewd one			1
' there 's no doubt that having a 29 - year - old female in the role will attract publicity to the club , ' she says			1
but as still says , that female has to have the brains to back up the beauty			0
' essentially , she had the business brain behind it , ' still says of @entity125			0
' she had the statistics , the enthusiasm - and that 's very important within every business environment			0
' ' it 's about being positive , streamlining			0
i 've got passion and enthusiasm			0
' i 'm going to observe and listen , and make the most out of the club 's resources			0
' i 'm taking my knowledge of business and i 'll implement changes			0
you have to move on and change everything - from it to catering			0
' we ca n't do the status quo any more			0
' watch @entity144 's first interview as ceo of @entity20 ...			0

at 29 , politics graduate @entity0 becomes the youngest chief executive in @entity18 football
