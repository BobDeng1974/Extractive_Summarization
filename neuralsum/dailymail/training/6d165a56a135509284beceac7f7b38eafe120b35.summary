the billionaire entrepreneur says he did not hire a work crew to plow the snow into the middle of @entity11 10th street so he could drop @entity12 for @entity13 and claims he has n't lived at the house for years			1

@entity31 path : a worker was seen friday morning shoveling snow in front of the 10th @entity36 home as the street was covered in snow careless : the snow was piled into the road without any care for neighbors or drivers high and dry : @entity0 , pictured at the 2012 @entity43 , is denying a @entity3 report claiming he had the snow cleared to make way for a @entity13 crew ' this was news to me , ' @entity0 wrote in an email			1
' i just learned of this via your article			0
' the snow was pushed into and up the narrow one - way street away from the home to provide a @entity13 crew space to hook up his $ 20million dollar pad with faster internet access than cable could provide , the source said			1
pictures show a clear disparity in the snow cover leading traffic east towards @entity65 from the six bedroom , seven - and - a - half bath palace and the bare pavement west towards @entity69			1
@entity0 said he no longer lives in the tony townhouse and has not ' for almost 2 years			2

@entity87 has already received 56.6 inches of snow already , with nearly half falling this month alone , according to the @entity89			0
this winter is already into the top five snowiest in history			0

all clear : @entity99 cones and a lack of snow mark the front of the tony townhouse infuriating : neighbors are said to be furious at the lack of regard for their safety by piling the snow into the middle of the busy , narrow street fantasy wedding : @entity0 's lavish wedding to @entity113 took place in a @entity116 redwood forest a @entity13 spokesperson declined to speak about the matter to @entity3 , and @entity0 did not immediately return a @entity28 message seeking comment			1

before : the redwood forest as it was prior to @entity0 's wedding under construction : @entity137 was removed from the forest floor , leaving only the towering redwoods behind the bridge to destruction : @entity0 's wedding planners significantly modified the forest , even building a stone bridge destroyed : some of the work even damaged the protected redwood trees - leading to millions in fines the wedding featured a cottage , fake ruins , waterfalls , staircases and a huge dance floor near iconic redwoods and a stream with threatened steelhead trout			0
