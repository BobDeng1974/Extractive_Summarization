by @entity1 reporter published : 09:56 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 10:08 est , 17 may 2013 this piano could be the narrowest in the world but pianists wo n’t have the chance to play a waltz or a sonata - as it has only five keys			2
with three white keys and two black and one pedal , composers would struggle to come up with a catchy tune			2
and that 's before you factor in the problem of it no longer having its strings and not making a sound			0
the 3ft 9in piano is less than a foot wide , so it 's probably for the best that it is now a sculpture , not a functioning instrument			1
sculptor @entity27 took a saw to a grand piano and turned it into a sculpture that sold for £ 2,400 the piano only has three white and two black keys - even @entity33 might struggle to work within such limits the sculpture is less than a foot wide - so even if sound were possible , you 'd have to stand up to play it the miniature grand was created by sculptor @entity27 , who took a saw to a full - size piano that was being thrown away			1
he chopped the instrument into three sections and threw away the middle piece , before sticking the two ends together			1
the piano strings had to be stripped out during the demolition , so you can tinkle the ivories but it wo n't make a sound			2
the piano was showcased at an exhibition and then sold for £ 2,400 to a museum			1
mr @entity27 , 38 , a full - time sculptor from @entity55 , @entity56 , said : ' i made this piece for a gallery show			1
' i showed an installation about the @entity61 , two hoarders who lived like hermits in @entity65 during the first half of the 20th century			0
' one of the brothers used to be a concert pianist and i thought a crippled piano could go well with their story			0
the piece was sold by @entity73 to a museum for £ 2,400 the grand piano that was being thrown away has had its life extended by the sculptor - and will be preserved in a museum ' there were people giving away pianos for free , so i took one and cut it into three pieces , threw away the middle section and reassembled the other two parts			1
' the lid and the music stand had to be cut separately as well			0
' i did n’t have the proper tools to cut the heavy casted metal frame that holds the strings inside the piano , the harp , so i decided not to use it			0
' it is not a functioning piano and i consider it to be a sculpture			0

sculptor @entity27 *rescued* the instrument from the *scrapheap*
he chopped up a grand piano and *melded* the two ends together
the 3ft 9in piano is less than a foot wide and sold to the tune of £ 2,400
