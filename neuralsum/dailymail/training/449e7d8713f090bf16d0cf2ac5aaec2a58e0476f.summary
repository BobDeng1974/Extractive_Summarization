@entity41 , curator of birds , said : ' we are keen to assess the condition of every flamingo and make sure that they are happy and healthy prior to the breeding season , which will begin in late spring			2
' it 's a very important part of our programme of care for the birds			0
and it is also really useful for us to know who 's who - the females have usually got much smaller skulls			2
' on top of this the checks will help us to be able to identify each and every one of the birds and look at how different pairs bond , as it 's not yet known whether or not flamingos choose different mates over the course of their lives or for how long they breed for			0
' this kind of information can then be passed on to help conservationists in the wild and help protect the long term future of the species			0
