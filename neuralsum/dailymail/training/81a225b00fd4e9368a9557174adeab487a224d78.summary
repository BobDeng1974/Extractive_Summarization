by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 13:59 est , 24 april 2013 a dedicated animal lover has set up a unique business baking cakes for dogs			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , bakes a mouth - watering array of sponge cakes , cookies , muffins and cupcakes specifically designed for man 's best friend			1
while standard human cakes made with sugar and chocolate could be harmful to our dogs and other animals , these cakes look like the real deal but with pet friendly ingredients - and dogs everywhere ca n't stop drooling over them			1
@entity25 the @entity24 tastes every one of @entity27 's creations before they go on sale			2
the cakes , which are made from ingredients like carrots and fruits , can also be enjoyed by humans @entity27 set up her animal bakery after realising there was a lack of treats available for dogs @entity27 bakes sponge cakes , cookies , muffins and cupcakes and has even tried most of them herself @entity27 , 22 , says she was inspired to set up her business when she struggled to find a birthday cake for her pet horse - and realised thre was nothing that looked like a birthday cake but was safe to eat and it 's not just dogs that have gone barking mad for @entity27 's creations - the cakes are suitable for most animals including cats , rabbits , horses , and incredibly , humans too			1
@entity27 even uses her fussy @entity24 , @entity25 , as the number one taste tester for all her products			0
@entity27 , 22 , said : ' i love making cakes for animals			0
it 's really challenging to find all the right ingredients , but as soon as you see a dog wolfing down something you 've slaved over , it makes it all worth while			1
' i always test out the products on my dog , and i take some down to the local animal rescue centre too - they 're very honest critics			1
' the mother of one set up @entity80 's @entity79 after struggling to find suitable birthday treats for her pets			2
' it was my horse 's birthday and i was trying to find a birthday cake for her			2
' i was looking around for ages and there just was n't anything available that would look like a birthday treat , but be safe for him to eat			2
after its initial success - with both pets and owners , @entity27 is now planning to continue to expand her business with new and exciting recipes since launching her business @entity27 has been inundated with orders for personalised birthday cakes though @entity27 has tried most of what she makes , she confesses she has not plucked up the courage to try her chicken and cheese cookies after posting a picture of the cake on @entity109 , @entity27 began to get requests from friends and family to make treats for their pets too ' in the end i decided to make one myself and after searching online i found a recipe for a yummy equine meadow cake			1
' it was basically just the same as a carrot cake but with a few extra types of fruit and other pet - friendly ingredients			1
' i remember thinking how easy it was to make and i wished that there were more products out there			0
' the mother of one set up @entity80 's @entity79 , whose the cakes are suitable for most animals including cats , rabbits , horses , and incredibly , humans too @entity27 takes a fresh batch of he doggy cookies out of the oven , but every new product has to be approved by her @entity25 after posting a picture of the cake on @entity109 , @entity27 began to get requests from friends and family to make treats for their pets too			1
' that 's when i realised that there was obviously a demand for these types of treats , so i set up @entity80 's @entity79 ' said @entity27			2
' when i told my partner , @entity148 , about it he was really supportive , although he definitely thought i 'd gone a bit mad			0
' my family are all as animal mad as me though , so they thought it was a great idea			0
' soon word got around about @entity27 's innovative new business , and the order started rolling in for personalised birthday cakes , doggy cookie platters and @entity161 hampers for pets			1
the @entity164 's bakery will bake nearly anything an owner desires for their much loved furry friend you can order a platter selection of goodies , should you chose to throw a party for your canine companion and invite his friends ' it was really exciting when people started ordering things , and now i get lots of commissions every week			1
' the most popular thing at the moment is the hampers for the dogs which include cakes and biscuits but i 'm always experimenting with new ideas			2
' i tend to take the basic cake recipe and then adapt it with different types of fruits			0
' so far my dog seems to think the carrot cake is the best , but she turned her nose up at the apple cake - that was a bit of a disaster			2
' @entity27 has to be especially careful that none of the ingredients are harmful for the animals , as well as keeping them healthy			0
@entity27 says of her venture : ' as soon as you see a dog wolfing down something you 've slaved over , it makes it all worth while ' @entity27 says she tends to take the basic cake recipe and then adapt it with different types of fruits to get many different flavours and varieties any chocolate that i use to decorate products is 100 per cent dog - friendly and i always have my long list of things that are poisonous to animals close by to ensure every item is safe			1
' for example dogs ca n't eat raisins or grapes so they 're never included in the things i bake			0
' the treats are really healthy too			0
i do n't put any sugar in them because you can use fruit to make the cakes and cookies sweet , and all the butter is unsalted			1
' the icing is all made out of fat - free soft cheese with food colouring			0
and as any good chef does , @entity27 tries out all her products to ensure they 're just right for her pampered pets			0
the cookies might be favoured by dogs , but they would also suit a human dieter as they contain no sugar - with all the sweetness coming from the fruit judging by the reaction of these two customers , it is easy to see why @entity27 's bakery has gone from strength to strength ' i have tried the horse cake , dog cake and dog muffins , which were fine for humans , too - just not as sweet as ours			1
' the only thing i have n't tried are the chicken and cheese cookies - although they 're my dog 's favourite			1
' @entity27 now plans to continue to expand her business with new and exciting recipes			0
' the next thing i 'd like to try is pet friendly pastry			0
i want to start making cheese straws and sweet pastry too			0
' it 's really exciting , i ca n't wait to see how the new recipes turn out			0
