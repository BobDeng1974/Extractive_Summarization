by @entity1 reporter published : 23:13 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 06:13 est , 11 march 2014 a condo in @entity4 has become so overrun with the junk and filth left by its hoarder owners that neighbors in adjoining units have had to pick and move thanks to vermin spilling over into their homes			1
the unit in the @entity15 has already been condemned by the @entity16 and one neighbor sick of the roaches , mice and fleas settling in her home has moved out			1
another neighbor says she 'll soon do the same as the condo association and even the town itself band together to sue the homeowner , who 's been @entity28 for a month			1
@entity29 : trash , clothes and collectible cars are piled to the point of blocking walkways and windows in an @entity16 , @entity4 condo filthy : roaches crawl the walls in the condo ( left ) that was so filthy for so long that vermin began taking up residents in adjoining units , and forcing neighbors out piled up : a man lived in the home in @entity16 , @entity4 along with his daughter and grandchild ' i ’m kind of in the same boat as ( the neighbor who moved ) , ' @entity49 told @entity51			1
' it ’s a nuisance , a headache , it ’s embarrassing and there ’s a stigma to it			2
' photos from from several visits to the home over the course of years show the floors , countertops and virtually all surfaces covered in progressively more trash , food waste and household items			2
roaches crawl up the walls and at least six chihuahuas roamed the filthy floors , adding their feces to the mess			1
officials at the time showed up because a baby was living in the home in the unsanitary conditions			1
the area humane society also joined the fray because of the dogs			0
according to @entity51 , a subsequent court order barred the homeowners from keeping pets from there on			0
unassuming : ' they ¿ re always really nice , ' said future ex-neighbor @entity49			0
' you never would know what was going on if you saw them ' litigation : the mess is so bad that the city and condo association have filed suit against the owners of the unit piles of filth : nearly every surface in the home is covered in trash and forgotten items dangerous : trash strewn about the house not only sent neighbors packing thanks to the vermin , but has officials concerned about the potential to start a massive house fire in the latest inspection , a child was living in the home along with its mother and grandfather			1
two dogs were found in the home			0
after the most recent inspection , a @entity119 judge gave the owners 10 days to rectify the situation			0
' the infestation did affect the entire building , ' said township building director @entity125			0
' the owners say they are going remove everything and scrub the bare walls and floors			0
' fit for a baby ? officials visited the home in 2011 to address an infant living there in unsanitary conditions at least six chihuahuas were found in the home during the february 2011 visit and a judge told the owners they could no longer keep pets feces was found all over the floors from the dogs it 's not known what became of the dogs that were taken from the home in 2011 , but two dogs were found during last month 's visit the township and condo association have joined litigation against the homeowners , who 've not been seen at the property since last month , despite the judge 's order to get it clean			1
meanwhile , the current neighbors just want things to be normal again and stayed positive , even when talking about the nuisance neighbors			1
' i would love to stay			0
this has been the only issue , ' @entity163 said			0
and of the hoarder owners : ' they ’re always really nice , ' she said of the condo owners			2
' you never would know what was going on if you saw them			0

neighbors , the condo association and even the @entity16 in @entity4 have filed suite against owners of a *horribly* unsanitary home
some adjoining neighbors say the mice , roaches and fleas have become so bad they 've been forced from their homes
the township condemned the condo and now *plaintiffs* want the home declared a public nuisance
an *unnamed* man and his daughter lived in the filthy home with a child and have not been seen on the property since it was condemned
