by @entity0 a middle - aged scientist has gone to great lengths to impress a girl - but unfortunately for him his chat up technique just did cut it			2
@entity7 , 54 , from @entity8 , was so keen on 23 - year - old @entity9 he went to the hairdresser and asked for a short back and sides that would help him stand out			1
and he got it when his hair was styled into a perfectly right - angled flat top - a bit like a @entity18 man			1
with that , he thought he could corner her			0
@entity9 said the hairdo had made her even more unlikely to respect him as he looked like a @entity18 figure or character from the video game ' warcraft '			1
she added : ' my friends call him blockhead , i can imagine he might have found someone as he had a good and respectable job as a medical laboratory scientist at the @entity39			2
but he should act his age			0
' @entity7 who is still single despite the expensive hairdo said : ' i ca n't understand it			1
i make an attractive monthly income of twd 70,000 ( Â£ 1,400 )			0
bit of a square : the young woman , @entity9 , said the hairdo had made her even more unlikely to respect him as he looked like a lego figure cornering her : @entity7 , who is still single despite the expensive hairdo , said : ' i ca n't understand it ' ' i adopted this hairstyle because i wanted to look like a guy in his 20s or 30s to attract the girl who rejected me			1
or in fact any girl			0
' styling his hair was not an easy task			0
he reportedly needs to use up two cans of gel and spends two hours doing his hair			0
he can also only comb it once every 15 days to get rid of dead hair			0
but the hairdo and the media coverage it attracted has made @entity7 a hit on the streets , with people pointing out ' blockhead ' to their kids and taking snaps of him			1
the famous local comic artist @entity74 even featured @entity7 in one of his stories after seeing him on the metro , saying ' i could not get his figure out of my mind , so i had to put it onto paper			2

@entity7 , 54 , from @entity8 , wanted a cut that would help him stand out
so , he got it styled into a perfectly right - angled flat top - like a @entity18 man
unfortunately , it did n't work and @entity7 's beau rejected his advances
she said she ca n't respect him and called him a ' blockhead '
@entity7 , who is still single despite the hairdo , said : ' i ca n't understand it '
