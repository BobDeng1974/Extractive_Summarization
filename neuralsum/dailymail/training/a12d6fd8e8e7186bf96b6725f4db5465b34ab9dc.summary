a council has sent out leaflets telling locals to ‘ take a shopping list ’ when they go out to buy food - and to put their purchases in the fridge or cupboard			1
@entity8 sent out the guide - called your guide to reducing @entity11 - to more than 30,000 locals			1
some people in the town in @entity15 described it as ‘ incredible ’ , while others said they thought it was a ‘ prank ’			0
the leaflet states : ‘ write a shopping list for your meal plan so you only buy what you really need			1
’ it says in the ‘ store correctly ’ column : ‘ keep essentials in the cupboard , fridge and freezer and keep an eye on use by and best before dates			0
' did you know you can freeze bread , cheese and milk ? ’ and advice on leftovers states : ‘ use up leftovers and pull together a delicious meal by combining them with your favourite ingredients			2
’ other advice in the leaflet includes how to measure out the correct amount of rice , spaghetti and pasta - so you do not make too much			2
' plan ahead ' : advice includes how to ‘ go shopping ’ , where to put your food and how to use up any leftovers locals say the advice is ‘ insulting ’ , adding that it seems to be aimed at children rather than adults			1
one resident , @entity67 , 34 , said today : ‘ when i got the leaflet through the door i thought i ’d give it a glance before putting it in the recycling bin			0
‘ when i read that it said i should put food in the fridge or cupboard and that i should write a shopping list i assumed the leaflet was for children			1
‘ but no , it ’s for us council taxpayers who are too dumb to work out how put away food			0
' it ’s incredible really , although i did n’t realise you could freeze milk , so i suppose i learned something at least			0
’ another local , @entity88 , 46 , said : ‘ i could n’t believe it when i read the leaflet - i thought it was a prank really			0
hq : a spokesman for @entity8 ( whose @entity94 is pictured ) said the leaflet was aimed at reducing the amount of food waste ' surely everybody knows to put some foods in the fridge and others in the cupboard			1
' and most people are aware that a shopping list is reasonably important when going shopping			2
' i know the council might be trying to be helpful , but this leaflet is really just a massive waste of our council tax money			0
’ a spokesman for the council said the leaflet was aimed at reducing the amount of waste			1
she added : ‘ recent analysis showed 30 percent of residents ’ black bin content is food waste			1
‘ this costs council taxpayers money in landfill charges , and costs us all in terms of the environmental impact			2
’ the council 's press office did not immediately answer a request from @entity129 to establish how much money was spent on the leaflets .			0
