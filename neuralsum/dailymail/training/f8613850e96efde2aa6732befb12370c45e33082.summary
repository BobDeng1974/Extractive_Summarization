a @entity2 family that walks on all fours do not walk like primates and are not an example of ' reverse evolution ' , scientists today claimed			1
the five brothers and sisters , aged between 18 and 34 and from a village in @entity11 , south @entity2 , have fascinated scientists across the world since they were first discovered in 2005			1
they get around by ' bear crawling ' on their feet and palms - and can only stand upright for a short time , with both knees and head flexed			1
walking on all fours : this man and his four siblings , aged between 18 and 34 and from a small village in @entity11 , south @entity2 , have fascinated scientists across the world since they were first discovered in 2005 earlier theories claimed the @entity1 's quadrupedal gait was similar to the movement of primates , suggesting ' a backwards stage in human evolution '			1
but now , @entity33 scientists have concluded that the siblings ' walk is an adaptation to an unforeseen and rare disorder			2
in a report published in @entity40 , the researchers said the family moves laterally - unlike primates , who walk in a diagonal sequence , repeatedly putting a hand on one side and a foot on the other			1
they claimed the siblings ' walk is , in fact , a byproduct of a hereditary condition that causes cerebellar hypoplasia , complicating their sense of balance			1
unusual walk : they brothers and sisters get around by ' bear crawling ' on their feet and palms - and can only stand upright for a short time , with both knees and head flexed			1
above , a female member of the family at home getting around : earlier theories claimed the @entity1 's quadrupedal gait was similar to the movement of primates , suggesting ' a backwards stage in human evolution '			1
above , members of the family walk on all fours to adapt to this condition , the family have developed quadrupedalism , they said			2
' i was determined to set the record straight , because these erroneous claims about the nature and cause of the quadrupedalism have been published over and over again , without any actual analysis of the biomechanics of their gait , and by researchers who are not experts in primate locomotion , ' lead researcher @entity94 , of the @entity95 , told the @entity96			0
' we have shown that the quadrupedalism resembles that of healthy human adults asked to walk quadrupedally in an experimental setting			2
[ they do not ] prefer the diagonal sequence / diagonal couplets gait characteristic of nonhuman primates			0
' movement : but now , @entity33 scientists have claimed the family moves laterally - unlike primates , who walk diagonally			1
above , a comparison of footfall sequence in primate ( baboon , top ) and nonprimate ( cat , bottom ) byproduct : they said the walk is a byproduct of a hereditary condition that causes cerebellar hypoplasia in 2005 , @entity124 researchers agreed in a separate study that the siblings ' walk differs from that of some primates , noting that they put all of their weight on their palms and wrists not their knuckles			1
however , @entity2 evolutionary biologist @entity135 previously claimed that the siblings , who also appear to have brain damage , suffered from a condition called @entity139			1
he declared that people affected by this syndrome walk with a quadrupedal locomotion and are afflicted with ' primitive ' speech and severe mental retardation , suggesting ' reverse evolution '			0
' the idea of reverse evolution was just a flash , an " aha " experience , ' mr @entity135 told @entity150			0
differences : in 2005 , @entity124 researchers agreed in a separate study that the siblings ' walk differs from that of some primates , noting that they put all of their weight on their palms and wrists ( pictured ) not their knuckles ' i suddenly realized they were exhibiting the walking style of our ape - like ancestors ... i was the scientist who first suggested the existence of reverse evolution in human beings			1
' the siblings , whose parents walk normally , were first filmed in the 2006 @entity170 documentary , @entity171 , which explored the science and story behind their plight			0
while two of the daughters and a son have only ever walked on two palms and two feet , another son and daughter sometimes manage to walk upright			2
family : the siblings , whose parents walk normally , also appear to have brain damage professor @entity185 , who visited the family twice during the documentary , said : ' it 's amazing as an example of a strange , strange aberration of human development			2
but their interest is how they can live in the modern world			0
' he said he thought the family had reverted to an instinctive form of behaviour encoded deep in the brain but abandoned during evolution			0
' i do not think they were destined to be quadrupeds by their genes , but their unique genetic make - up allowed them to be , ' he said			0
' it has produced an extraordinary window on our past			0
it is physically possible , which no one would have guessed from the modern human skeleton			0
' he added : ' however they arrived at this point , we have adult human beings walking like ancestors several million years ago			0
' the five siblings , who have 14 other brothers and sisters who are not affected by the condition , spend most of their time sitting outside the family 's basic rural home			2
however , one brother travels to the local village where he engages in basic interactions with people			0
the latest research was carried out by ms @entity94 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 , all of @entity238 , @entity239 , of @entity240 and @entity241 , of the @entity242 .			0

five brothers and sisters , aged between 18 and 34 , live in @entity11 , @entity2
they get around their village by ' bear crawling ' on their feet and palms
they have fascinated scientists since they were first discovered in 2005
earlier theories claimed the @entity258 siblings moved in same way as primates
this suggested ' a backwards stage in human evolution , ' it was theorised
but now , scientists have claimed siblings walk laterally unlike primates
they say walk is byproduct of a hereditary condition relating to balance
