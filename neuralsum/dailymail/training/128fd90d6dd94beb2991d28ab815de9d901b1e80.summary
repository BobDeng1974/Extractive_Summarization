@entity0 broke @entity2 hearts in last season 's @entity4 play - offs - and @entity7 boss @entity6 believes the @entity2 will be ' hurting ' ahead of saturday 's showdown at @entity9			1
the dramatic 21 - 20 victory for @entity0 , which was secured by a late @entity11 try , ended @entity2 's run of appearing in every @entity4 final since 2004			1
@entity0 marched on to @entity13 , where they beat @entity14 in similarly dramatic circumstances to be crowned @entity17 champions for the first time , and victory this weekend would guarantee they lead the @entity4 heading into @entity20			1
@entity0 boss @entity6 wants his team to be wary of @entity2 looking for revenge on saturday ' it is going to be massive again , ' @entity6 said			1
' @entity2 have had a few sort of ups and downs a little bit this season , but generally they are getting back up there , they are playing well , they have got lots of players back and we know that games against @entity2 are good spicy affairs			2
' while @entity2 will arrive in the hotbed of an @entity39 derby following back - to - back @entity42 games against @entity44 heavyweights @entity36 , @entity7 hardly broke sweat in racking up more than 100 points at @entity49 side @entity48 's expense			1
@entity6 , though , does not not believe such contrasting derby build - ups will have any bearing on their fierce rivals ' latest meeting			1
' sometimes , it can help you in that you are playing at that level and intensity , but i think all our players are used to it , ' @entity6 added			2
' they play in enough big games over the season , and we are going into it in good shape			0
we have got a good fit squad			0
' what a cracking game it was last time ( against @entity2 )			2
@entity71 is looking forward to being involved in another exciting encounter against @entity2 ' it was so close and could have gone either way , so they will be hurting , but we also remember they 've had the better record against us over the past few outings			2
' we won the last one , but generally they 've done the job on us			0
' @entity81 lock @entity71 , who signed a new @entity0 contract this week , said : ' it is a local derby , and all the boys know it 's going to be ferocious			2
' it is the first time we have played them since last season 's semi-final			0
they will be ready to get some revenge on us , and we have to be ready for that			0
' local bragging rights are also up for grabs in the west country on saturday when @entity99 and @entity100 clash at @entity101			1
last season 's corresponding clash - won 18 - 17 by @entity100 following a late converted penalty try - proved eventful for all the wrong reasons after @entity99 finished the game with only 11 players			1
scrum - half @entity107 was sent off following a mass brawl close to full - time , while home prop @entity111 received a red card earlier in the game			0
@entity99 also had two players sin - binned , and @entity100 picked up three yellow cards			1
@entity100 's star rugby league recruit @entity115 returns to the bench this weekend after making his full debut on the @entity119 stage against @entity120 last friday , with @entity121 partnering @entity122 in midfield			1
@entity115 is set to return to the bench for @entity100 after making his @entity119 debut against @entity120 ' since i 've arrived ( at the club ) , nearly every @entity99 supporter i 've met , the one game they 've talked about is @entity100 , ' @entity99 rugby director @entity126 said			1
' but we have spoken about it this week as being just another game , it 's game 10 of 22 across the course of the season			0
' in this league , every game is important and it 's a big run for us coming into the @entity20 period			0
' we 've got a little bit of momentum , based on the last three games			0
we 've actually played quite well			0
' but @entity100 is going to be a huge test			0
they 've been outstanding this season , so for us it 's another chance for us to measure ourselves against one of the top teams in the country			0
' elsewhere on saturday , @entity14 host rock - bottom @entity150 and @entity152 entertain @entity153 , while sunday 's @entity4 action sees @entity155 - watched by a crowd of more than 28,000 - play their first home game at @entity160 's @entity159 , with @entity161 providing the opposition .			2

@entity0 won 21 - 20 against @entity2 to end their @entity4 final run
coach @entity6 has prepared his team to face an angry @entity2 side
