in the 1950s @entity0 were left stunned by a series of seemingly inexplicable @entity3 sightings			1
throughout the decade numerous lights in the sky were reported by members of the public and pilots alike , with some suggesting they were of extraterrestrial origin			0
but now the mystery has apparently been solved , as the @entity11 has revealed it was n’t et at all - rather , it was the agency flying their secretive u- 2 aircraft high in the atmosphere			1
in a tweet earlier this week the @entity11 claimed responsibility for numerous @entity3 sightings over @entity0 in the 1950s			1
at the time the agency carried out a study of over 1,200 @entity3 sightings and found over half of them could be attributed to their secretive u- 2 aircraft , which began flying in secret from 1955 at over 60,000 feet in a tweet the @entity11 said : ‘ remember reports of unusual activity in the skies in the ‘ 50s ? that was us			1
’ the revelation originally came about through something known as @entity35 in 1969			0
nicknamed ‘ @entity36 ’ , the @entity36 is an ultra-high altitude reconnaissance aircraft operated by the @entity38 ( @entity38 )			0
the first flight of one of the single - engine planes was on 1 august 1955 , with regular flights beginning in 1957			0
it has an operational ceiling of 70,000 feet ( 21,000 metres ) , making it well - suited for spying missions			2
it was used extensively throughout the @entity48 , flying over the @entity49 , @entity50 and other countries			0
they did not go completely undetected , however			0
one infamous incident occurred on 1 may 1960 when pilot @entity54 was shot down during a reconnassiance flight over the @entity49			0
the event marked a deterioration in relations between the two superpowers			0
@entity54 was held prisoner until 10 february 1962 , when he was released as part of a prisoners exchange with @entity49 officer @entity63			0
this was a systematic study of various @entity3 reports that sought to discover if the sightings were a threat to national security			0
in the end the project determined that , of the 12,618 @entity3 reports collected , almost all of them could be attributed to misidentification of natural phenomena such as clouds , or conventional aircraft			2
a number of reports , however , were revealed to be high - altitude reconnaissance aircraft such as the u- 2 and @entity83			2
the secretive planes were able to fly above 60,000 feet ( 18,000 metres ) but , as they were kept under wraps , pilots at the time did n’t think anything man - made was flying that high			2
so when they spotted sunlight glinting off planes much higher than they were flying , they occasionally thought that what they were seeing was out of this world			2
‘ high - altitude testing of the u- 2 soon led to an unexpected side effect - a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects ( @entity3 ’s ) , ’ the @entity11 says in their book ‘ the @entity11 and the @entity98 ’			1
‘ in the mid- 1950s , most commercial airliners flew at altitudes between 10,000 and 20,000 feet [ 3,000 and 6,000 metres ] and military aircraft like the b - 47s and b - 57s operated at altitudes below 40,000 feet			0
‘ consequently once @entity112 started flying at altitudes above 60,000 feet [ 18,000 metres ] , air - traffic controllers began receiving increasing numbers of @entity3 reports			2
’ the @entity11 reports how these sightings in turn led to @entity35 , which ultimately found that one - half of all @entity3 reports in the late 1950s and most of the 1960s were caused by @entity3			1
but , at the time , they could not reveal this to the public			0
the @entity11 has said that numerous @entity3 sightings in the 1950s and 1960s can be attributed to flights of its u- 2 aircraft ( @entity36 pictured )			1
the plane was flown in secret , unbeknown to regular pilots at the time , so when they saw sunlight glint off its wings much higher than them they would often report the sighting as a @entity3 when the @entity11 investigated numerous @entity3 sightings in the 1950s and 60s they found most could be attributed to natural phenomena or manmade objects			1
this pictured from 16 may 1966 in @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 shows a @entity3 that the @entity38 later claimed was ' swamp gas ' one @entity3 expert , however , is not convinced by the @entity11 's claims			1
' it is ironic that the @entity11 is now keen to declare that many high altitude @entity3 sightings were caused by their secret @entity36 aircraft missions , ' @entity143 , author of the @entity144 , tells @entity149			1
' as early as 1962 a @entity139 engineer called @entity151 warned ufologists that the @entity11 was feeding them with false information to sustain the idea that @entity3 were interplanetary vehicles			0
' ' in july 1952 there was a wave of @entity3 sightings over @entity159 that hit the newspaper headlines and led the @entity11 to convene a panel of experts to review the subject			2
' this was headed by dr. @entity165 and after four days they concluded that most sightings were caused by misidentification and a mild form of mass - hysteria			0
' regarding the latest " revelation " that the @entity36 aircraft caused a majority of @entity3 sightings is nothing new , and some have noted that it is significant that they should bring this to light on @entity177 on 2 july			1
' it is also noteworthy that they mention the @entity36 caused @entity3 sightings over @entity0 in the late 1950s , yet this does not explain a multitude of sightings over @entity0 and @entity184 during the @entity186 ‘ @entity187 ’ exercises in 1952 before the @entity36 was built			1
' in their study of @entity3 sightings the @entity11 also found that many of the reports could be attributed to saucer - shaped clouds such as a lenticular cloud , seen here			1
@entity3 expert @entity143 , however , is n't convinced by their claims , and finds it ' ironic ' that they would make the ' revelation ' on @entity177			1

the @entity11 has claimed responsibility for various @entity3 sightings in the 1950s
they say lights over @entity0 can be attributed to their u- 2 aircraft
the plane began flying in secret from 1955 and remains in operation today
it is capable of flying up to 70,000 feet , meaning it was much higher than conventional planes in the 50s and 60s
this meant that , when some pilots saw sunlight glint off the planes above them , they reported them as ufos as they did n't know the u- 2 existed
the @entity11 discovered the misidentifications in ' @entity35 '
one @entity3 expert is *unconvinced* , however , saying it is ' ironic ' the @entity11 would reveal this on @entity177
