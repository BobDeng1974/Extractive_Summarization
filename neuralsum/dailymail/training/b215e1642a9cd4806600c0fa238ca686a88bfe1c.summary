@entity4 , ( pictured left ) 46 , was infected with a disease called necrotising fasciitis , which quickly attacked his right leg			1
in order to attack the aggressive disease ( pictured right ) , surgeons had to strip disease flesh from mr @entity4 ' leg below the knee in an emergency operation when his leg ballooned to twice its normal size within just 30 minutes , he was forced to cut away his boot			1
mr @entity4 told get @entity22 : ‘ it was as if someone had stuck a red - hot poker into me			2

it can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister			0
the earliest sign of the bug is people being in severe pain , which seems out of proportion to any external signs of the infection			2
as it progresses , fever , diarrhoea and vomiting can occur before the person falls unconscious			0

i was in toxic shock - my kidneys and liver were shutting down - i was dying			0
’ experts are unsure how the lorry driver caught the bug , but think that his ‘ diabolically weak ’ immune system is to blame			0
he is now having physiotherapy to help him walk again , as the lifesaving operation he underwent has left him unable to move without the aid of a frame or walking sticks			1
because of his inability to move around easily , mr @entity4 gained weight rapidly , which worsened his type 2 diabetes that he has lived with for more than 15 years			2
he reached 30 stone ( 191kg ) in may 2013 and his blood sugar levels became dangerously high			0
he turned to diabetes.co.uk ’s online forum for help , where others with diabetes encouraged him to take control of his life			0
mr @entity4 has now lost 12 stone , which has improved his diabetes			2
however , he has been told his prospects of walking normally again are not good			0
however he is determined to return to work and has vowed to keep trying .			0
