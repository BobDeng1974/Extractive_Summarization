@entity0 was accused of another u-turn after he said he had abandoned plans for his ' crude ' mansion tax levied on £ 2million homes @entity0 was accused of another u-turn yesterday after he said he had abandoned plans for his ' crude ' mansion tax levied on £ 2million homes			1
the @entity11 leader said he was ditching the idea of charging a one per cent levy on the most expensive properties in favour of a ' mini-mansion tax ' of adding higher council tax bands			1
the mansion tax had been enthusiastically backed by business secretary @entity19			2
mr @entity0 said : ' i went off , big time , the idea that you have a fixed levy as a percentage over a certain value			2
the more i looked at it , the more i thought , ' that 's very crude			0
' it leads to eye - watering amounts of tax being paid			0
' what we should do is go with the grain of the council tax system and apply bands to higher properties			1
' mr @entity0 's remarks come after @entity38 caused a furore at his party conference last month by pledging to introduce a mansion tax on £ 2 million homes			1
@entity43 is not planning to use the council tax system to apply the tax , leading critics to complain it would hit homeowners who had lived in their properties for a long time and were ' asset rich but cash poor '			2
earlier this year , mr @entity19 was still arguing that a one per cent tax on property in excess of £ 2million was his preferred form of mansion tax			1
but @entity11 chief secretary to the treasury @entity57 has now lobbied mr @entity0 to introduce new bands starting at , for example , £ 2million , £ 4million and £ 10million			1
it means the party could also ditch the term ' mansion tax ' in favour of ' higher council tax ' – although the extra money raised would be siphoned off by the @entity67 rather than kept by local authorities			1
mr @entity57 is due to set out more details over the new plan in his conference speech today			0
his aides said the new approach was being favoured over the old system because it would be easier to implement			0
one said : ' it would be simpler to put into action			0
with a crude mansion tax , you have to know the exact value of everyone 's property over £ 2million			1
but if you 're working with a series of price bands , you would n't need to do that			0
' the @entity11 leader said he was ditching the idea of charging a one per cent levy on the most expensive properties in favour of a ' mini-mansion tax ' of adding higher council tax bands the revenue from the new system – about £ 1.7billion – would be roughly the same			1
last night @entity95 mp @entity94 accused the @entity11 of a u-turn over the ' shambles ' of their ' unfair and unworkable ' mansion tax policy – just as mr @entity0 abandoned his pledge to scrap university tuition fees after the last election			1
mr @entity94 said : ' the one thing voters need to know about is that the @entity11 want to get more tax off people who have worked hard and bought their own homes			1
this is a home tax			0
' he added he was surprised mr @entity0 's party had ' changed policy before an election – they normally do it afterwards			0
' the policy change may prompt fears among some @entity11 that mr @entity0 is trying to water down his tax policy			2
last night , sources close to mr @entity19 said he was ' not opposed ' to the new council tax band version			2
but they added : ' the devil , of course , will be in the detail of what 's proposed			0
' a succession row broke out among @entity11 last night as the party leader ’s closest ally , @entity123 , hinted he ’d like the top job			2
health minister mr @entity123 is loyal to mr @entity0 , whom he praises as ‘ extraordinarily resilient ’			0
senior party figures keen to stop @entity128 president @entity127 becoming leader have spoken of mr @entity123 as a favourite			0
asked if he would stand in a leadership contest , mr @entity123 said : ‘ it is not something i am ruthlessly ambitious for , but i do n’t rule it out ... ’ that is political - speak for ‘ yes ’ .			0
