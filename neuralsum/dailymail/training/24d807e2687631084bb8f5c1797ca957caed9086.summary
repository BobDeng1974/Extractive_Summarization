the @entity0 lost little time in ridiculing @entity2 's decision to hold a referendum on @entity4 saying they will ' roll out the red carpet ' for @entity7 should @entity9 vote to leave the @entity10			1
@entity0 foreign minister @entity11 was mimicking the prime minister 's comment last summer , that @entity9 would welcome @entity0 companies if a left - wing government was elected in @entity0			1
his cheeky quip came as @entity2 promised a referendum on the issue of @entity10 membership by 2017 providing he is re-elected			2
quip : as @entity2 promised a referendum on @entity4 , @entity0 foreign minister @entity11 said his country would ' roll out the red carpet ' for @entity25 businessmen if the @entity25 voted to leave the @entity10 mr @entity11 suggested that @entity9 will turn into a basket case economy if it does exit the @entity10 following the nationwide poll			1
speaking on @entity0 radio just before mr @entity2 made his keynote speech in @entity31 , mr @entity11 said he had told a recent meeting of @entity25 businessmen : ‘ if @entity9 wants to leave @entity4 we will roll out the red carpet for you			1
’ mr @entity11 said @entity9 had ‘ positive points ’ to offer @entity4 , but said that there could be no ‘ @entity38 ’ with the @entity25 choosing what it wanted to contribute			1
‘ imagine that @entity4 is a football club , ’ said mr @entity11			0
‘ you join the football club , but once you ’re in , you ca n’t say “ @entity43 ” ’			0
speaking this morning to business leaders at the @entity46 headquarters in central @entity31 , mr @entity2 promised to hold a straightforward ' in / out ' referendum on @entity9 ’s membership of the @entity10			1
he declared : ' it is time for the @entity25 people to have their say			0
it is time to settle this @entity4 question in @entity25 politics			0
' pledge : @entity2 promised an in / out referendum on the @entity25 's membership of the @entity10 by the end of 2017 , if the @entity58 win the next general election the prime minister rejected the founding @entity10 principle of ' ever closer union ' , insisting powers must flow back to , not just away from member states			1
he warned public disillusionment with the @entity10 is ' at an all time high '			0
but he insisted it was in @entity9 's interest to remain in a reformed @entity10 , and if he can secure changes he will argue in favour of staying in			1
he added : ' because i believe something very deeply			0
that @entity9 ’s national interest is best served in a flexible , adaptable and open @entity10 and that such a @entity10 is best with @entity9 in it			2
' we will give the @entity25 people a referendum with a very simple in or out choice to stay in the @entity10 on these new terms or come out altogether			2
' over the coming weeks , months and years , i will not rest until this debate is won			0
for the future of my country			0
for the success of the @entity10			0
and for the prosperity of our peoples for generations to come			0
' wading in : @entity31 mayor @entity87 suggested a @entity0 tax on financial transactions would ' cost jobs ' in @entity91 it was mr @entity2 who , last summer , infuriated @entity0 socialists by saying his country would ‘ roll out the red carpet ’ to @entity0 companies if a left - wing government was elected			1
the @entity94 did win the election , and since then numerous business leaders have made plans to emigrate so as to avoid a top tax rate of 75 per cent			0
the @entity25 and @entity0 have clashed repeatedly over @entity4 financial policy in recent years , and have always had very different views about the future of the @entity10			1
in a high high - profile argument over new @entity4 budget rules at a summit in 2011 , the then conservative @entity0 president @entity106 famously told mr @entity2 he had ‘ missed a great opportunity to shut his mouth			2
’ @entity31 mayor @entity87 has also suggested that @entity0 ’s determination to implement a tax on financial transactions would ‘ clearly cost jobs ’ in @entity91 and said the @entity25 capital would benefit			1
‘ bienvenue à @entity31 – this is the global capital of finance , ’ mr @entity87 said last year			0
‘ it ’s on your doorstep and if your own president does not want the jobs , the opportunities and the economic growth that you generate , we do			0
’ several hundred thousand @entity0 citizens already live and work in @entity31 and all of @entity0 ’s major banks have offices in the @entity25			2
meanwhile @entity134 chancellor @entity133 said her government would be ready to listen to @entity9 's ' wishes ' over the @entity10 in the hope of finding a ' fair compromise '			1
she said : ' @entity134 , and i personally , want @entity9 to be an important part and an active member of the @entity10			1
' we are prepared to talk about @entity25 wishes but we must always bear in mind that other countries have different wishes and we must find a fair compromise			1
we will talk intensively with @entity9 about its individual ideas but that has some time over the months ahead			0
' however her foreign minister @entity151 warned @entity25 against ' cherry - picking ' on @entity4			2
arguing for more @entity4 integration , mr @entity151 said : ' @entity134 wants the @entity25 to remain an active and constructive part of the @entity10 ... but cherry picking is not an option			1
' fears : both @entity134 chancellor @entity133 and @entity159 deputy prime minister @entity158 hope that @entity9 stay within the @entity10 @entity160 , a close ally of @entity133 's and head of the @entity163 european affairs committee said ; ' @entity2 said that he wants @entity9 to shape the future			1
' how can you shape the future if you put the car in reverse while other regions of the world are on the fast lane ? ' in a changing world , voices from @entity4 will only be heard if we join forces			0
as the @entity177 saying goes : if you want to travel fast , go alone			0
if you want to travel far , go together			0
' i 'm a bit surprised that @entity9 wants to renegotiate the rules			0
@entity9 is not a new member state , it did not just join the @entity10			2
' it had a say in negotiating all the rules and treaties			0
if we opened that @entity186 , all the pulling and hauling would start again and we would probably end up in the same spot			0
@entity189 's foreign minister @entity188 warned a withdrawal would leave @entity25 industry and commerce balanced on ' a few insular stools ' ' by announcing a referendum for 2016 , @entity2 risks to paralyze the @entity10 for years			1
but @entity9 needs a @entity10 and especially a single market that is functioning			2
' in @entity201 , @entity196 , the @entity134 president of the @entity197 and a member of the centre - left @entity199 ( @entity199 ) seeking to topple @entity133 's conservatives at the general election in september , sharply rebuffed @entity2 's @entity204 said : ' the reforms necessary to make the @entity10 more effective , more transparent and leaner had failed in part because @entity9 had blocked them			1
they are the ones who are largley responsible for the delays in @entity4 and also the ones pointing their fingers at @entity4			0
' @entity9 just wants to reduce the @entity10 to an overseas marketplace			2
' and @entity189 's foreign minister @entity188 accused @entity9 of ' dragging its feet ' and warned a withdrawal would leave @entity25 industry and commerce balanced on ' a few insular stools '			1
he said : ' i am convinced that abandoning @entity4 would be a terrible blow to @entity9 's finance and industry ...			1
trying to compete in isolation with powers like the @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 is not to understand the times in which we are living			0
' for the @entity10 it is not good that a country as important as the @entity25 goes , but on the other hand @entity2 needs to understand that you can not keep stopping the engine , can not seek a renegotiation of treaties undoing what we have done , or putting the brakes on the speed at which the @entity10 is cruising at a time when integration is more necessary than ever			2
@entity159 's deputy prime minister @entity158 said it was in @entity9 's best interests to remain within the @entity10			1
he said : ' the @entity10 is better with @entity9 in it , and i think @entity9 is better being in the @entity10			2

@entity11 was mimicking @entity246 's comment last summer , that @entity9 would welcome @entity0 companies if @entity0 elected a left - wing government
he suggested @entity9 will turn into a basket case economy if it does exit the @entity10 following the nationwide poll
@entity134 chancellor @entity133 said she would listen to @entity9 's ' wishes ' over the @entity10 in the hope of finding a ' fair compromise ' .
