a crackdown to prevent @entity2 jihadis fighting in @entity3 and @entity4 from bringing bloodshed to @entity2 ’s streets was in disarray last night			1
@entity8 yesterday said it ‘ sticks in the craw ’ that fanatics can go abroad , pledge allegiance to the @entity13 and still expect to be free to return to the @entity2			1
but , despite it being heavily trailed over the weekend , there was no firm commitment to new legislation to bar them from coming back			0
@entity30 , the @entity31 attorney general , last night claimed such a move was ‘ probably impossible ’ and many @entity33 are fiercely opposed			1
there was also confusion over an apparently firm commitment by mr @entity8 to reinstate powers that allow terror suspects living in the @entity2 to be relocated away from other extremists , or placed in ‘ internal exile ’			1
within hours of the move being announced to mps , sources close to deputy prime minister @entity24 warned that he had only agreed to ‘ look at ’ the idea of exiling terror suspects to other parts of the country – and may yet block them			0
a senior @entity33 source said : ‘ frankly , we are going to take a lot of convincing before we sign up to any new legislation in this area			1
obstacle : the prime minister will have to get his plans for a crackdown approved in cross-party talks ‘ it would be a huge step for the state to forcibly remove someone from their friends and family , and possibly job , and put them in another part of the country when they had not been tried or convicted of a crime			1
’ it was an intervention by mr @entity24 that forced relocation to be scrapped three years ago , as part of the axing of control orders			0
in a statement to the @entity75 yesterday , three days after the terror threat to the @entity2 was raised from ‘ substantial to severe ’ , mr @entity8 struck a determined tone			1
‘ adhering to @entity2 values is not an option or a choice , ’ he said			1
‘ it is a duty for all those who live in these islands so we will stand up for our values , we will in the end defeat this extremism and we will secure our way of life for generations to come			0
’ a @entity2 woman is among seven suspected @entity2 jihadis caught by @entity93 border guards trying to cross into @entity4			1
the woman and two @entity2 men were stopped near @entity96 , one of a network of @entity93 frontier towns dubbed the ‘ gateway to jihad ’			1
they were questioned but were not arrested and are therefore free to try again , intelligence officials said last night			0
four @entity2 men , aged 20 to 35 , carrying 2,000 @entity104 dollars ( around £ 1,200 ) were stopped recently near the town and were also released			2
@entity93 authorities have struggled to stop foreign suspected jihadis , since many enter @entity93 with a 90 - day visa and are therefore not committing an offence			0
intelligence officers warn there has been an alarming increase in the number of @entity2 ‘ volunteers ’ travelling to join @entity116			2
up to 20 @entity2 are believed to be in safe houses waiting to cross over into @entity4 , including several women , who are playing an increasingly prominent role in @entity116			2
but it later emerged that he had not secured agreement with his junior coalition partner on all the measures announced			0
those that do have support include legislation to give the police statutory powers to confiscate the passports of suspect terrorists at @entity2 borders as they try to leave the country			1
airlines will also be forced to hand over advance passenger information to the security services or be banned from landing their planes in the @entity2			2
but , despite a weekend of intense talks between mr @entity8 and mr @entity24 , aides made it clear there were key areas where no deal had been reached			1
action : @entity8 told mps he would look ' very favourably ' on a request for arms from the @entity150 forces these included the power to stop @entity2 - born citizens who have been fighting abroad from returning to the @entity2 , potentially rendering them temporarily stateless			1
mr @entity8 told mps it was ‘ abhorrent ’ that @entity2 - born jihadis who hated @entity2 should be allowed to come back			1
‘ it absolutely sticks in the craw that someone can go from this country to @entity4 , declare jihad , make all sorts of plans to start doing us damage and then contemplate returning to @entity2 having declared their allegiance to another state , ’ he said			2
but what will emerge from the ‘ cross-party talks ’ is far from clear			1
shadow home secretary @entity170 said : ‘ the prime minister ’s proposals on @entity2 citizens returning are very unclear and confusing			2
it is n’t clear what they want to do , how it would work in practice , what it means for citizenship or how it would comply with international law			0
’ prevent @entity2 jihadis from returning to the @entity2 having been heavily - trailed over the weekend as a firm proposal to strip @entity2 nationals of their passport , potentially rendering them stateless , it was yesterday downgraded to an idea the government supports in ‘ principle ’			1
government lawyers , @entity33 and @entity31 attorney general @entity30 warn that it will breach the @entity2 ’s international obligations and possibly common law			1
details yesterday were worryingly vague , and it will now be subject to ‘ cross-party talks ’ – which many suspect is the equivalent of kicking it into the long grass			1
failure to take decisive action will infuriate the public – and many @entity206 – who say anybody who has declared allegiance to the @entity13 should lose their rights to return			0
extend @entity211 so terror suspects can be relocated away from their home the power , part of the old control order regime , was widely used by security officials to split up groups of fanatics living in the @entity2 and make them easier to monitor			2
to appease @entity24 , it was axed when @entity211 ( terrorism prevention investigation measures ) were introduced three years ago			0
since then , two terror suspects subject to @entity211 have absconded – including @entity225 extremist @entity223 , who escaped from a @entity227 mosque dressed in a burka			0
@entity229 will welcome the return of this disruption tactic , but last night it was mired in confusion with the @entity33 insisting they have not yet ‘ signed - off ’ on the idea			1
force returning jihadis to undergo a de-radicalisation programme this is intended to answer critics who claim the government ’s anti-extremist @entity240 programme is an expensive failure			0
however , the new law will apply only to suspects who are placed under a @entity211 rather than every returning fighter			0
currently , there is not a single person under a @entity211			0
they have proved less popular with police and security services than control orders			0
at least 250 fanatics are already suspected of having returned to the @entity2 from @entity4 and @entity3			2
give police new powers to confiscate the passports of terror suspects the home secretary can already use the royal prerogative to remove the passports of people suspected of travelling overseas to engage in terrorism			0
the new measure extends the power to police , who will be given temporary permission to withhold a travel document at @entity2 borders while further checks are carried out			2
it is intended to close a loophole where police think suspects are acting suspiciously at the borders , but do not have enough evidence to prevent them boarding a flight			0
significantly , mr @entity8 also promised to overturn any court ruling that declares the use of the royal prerogative illegal – suggesting a damaging human rights judgment is imminent			2
@entity279 airlines from landing in the @entity2 unless they give passenger details this addresses a problem under which six @entity284 airlines in countries with strict privacy laws refuse to give advance passenger details to the government ’s controversial @entity289 scheme so a passenger can be checked against terror watchlists			0
a new piece of stand - alone legislation is expected shortly			0
it would allow @entity297 citizens to be banned from boarding a flight and allow @entity2 nationals to be put under close surveillance when they return .			0

@entity8 vowed to implement law to ground @entity2 jihadis
but many @entity33 fiercely opposed motion in cross-party talks
also confusion over practicality of @entity311 's plan to relocate terrorists
