by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 09:41 est , 25 july 2012 a @entity2 fishing trip turned to horror when a man collecting firewood in the dead of night stumbled across hundreds of human foetuses scattered in the woods			1
the 248 embryos , most of which were already formed into babies ' bodies , had been stashed inside four huge vats of formaldehyde and dumped near the town of @entity17 , in the industrial heartland of @entity2 's @entity19			1
it is unclear how long the 15 - centimetre bodies , aged between 12 and 16 weeks , had been lying in the dusty wilderness but some had shrunk as if mummified			1
one theory is that they were illegally dumped after being used for scientific experimentation			1
and in a particularly chilling twist , what appear to be the the family names of their mothers were even written on labels attached to their tiny hands and legs			1
given the state of the embryos and unconfirmed dates on the labels , @entity2 police believe some could have been born as long as ten years ago			2
industrial : the 248 embryos , many of which were already formed into babies ' bodies , had been stashed inside four blue vats of formaldehyde and dumped near the town of @entity17 , in the industrial heart of @entity2 's @entity19 @entity58 : in a particularly chilling twist , what appear to be the the family names of their mothers were even written on labels attached to their tiny hands and legs			1
' a friend of mine called at night and said he went finishing and wanted to get some wood for his fire , a local told @entity2 ’s @entity68 today			2
' he found some abandoned water canisters and wanted to take them for his house			0
and when he came up , he saw … little baby bodies			0
' industrial town : the bodies were dumped near the @entity2 town of @entity17 , in the heart of the @entity19 the four friends noticed the contents because some of the lids to the vats had popped open when they were dropped and some of the embryos had spilled to the ground			1
@entity17 authorities were eager to distance themselves from the grisly find			2
' our area is too small ; we ca n't have so many stillborns , miscarriages or artificial abortions , ' said a spokesman			0
a spokesman for the regional police said the horrifying find was ' biological waste ' from four nearby medical facilities in @entity98 , the region 's major city			0
' it appears a waste disposal company has failed to carry out its duties properly , ' he added			0
in @entity2 , embryos are classed as a hazardous wasted and are disposed of immediately			2
however they are always sealed into air - tight packages before disposal , never large plastic containers			0
it is neither common practice to attach labels to the bodies of embryos due to be disposed of			0
police have now launched an investigation into how the gruesome content was dumped in public land and what they were being used for			0
one theory is that they may have been used for medical studies , such as stem cell research			0
remote : @entity17 lies in the heart of @entity2 's industrial heartland in the remote @entity19 some 2,000 miles east of @entity123			1

the 15 - centimetre embryos had been stashed inside four huge vats of formaldehyde and dumped near @entity17 in the @entity19
they were aged between 12 and 16 weeks and shrunken like mummies
the family names of their mothers even appeared to be written on labels attached to their tiny hands and legs
mystery shrouds the chilling discovery which has sparked a police probe
dead foetuses in @entity2 are never labeled or packed into plastic vats
one theory is that they were off casts of a scientific experimentation
