@entity10 football matches could be taken around the country again from 2018 if the @entity12 secures the @entity5 franchise			1
@entity13 , managing director of @entity5 @entity1 , said there was " real momentum " around @entity16 in @entity1 with the sport now staging three matches at @entity6 this season			2

" we are going to have a look at seeing if we can grow from that over the next couple of years and see where we go from there			0
" we 're very interested in exploring the idea of a @entity1 - based franchise and seeing if we can pull it off			2
that 's the way of making our sport much more mainstream			0

" @entity13 warned that there was still much work to do before a plan could be put in place			0
he added : " it 's not just about the logistics of where a team might come from or whether it would be a new team , it 's also scheduling , air travel , a tonne of other logistics			0
