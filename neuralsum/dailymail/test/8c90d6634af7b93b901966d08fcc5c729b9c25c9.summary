a cat has laid a claim to having the loudest purr in the world because she makes noises as loud as a @entity7 train			1
12 - year - old @entity8 has a growl which is louder than most cats can miaow , and has reached a maximum of 93 decibels - more than the official world record holder			1
despite her fearsome sound , @entity8 is said to be gentle and loving , and is currently in a rehoming centre in @entity16 looking for a new owner			2
' we thought it would be fun to see just how loud it is so we recorded it and it reached 93 decibels at its loudest , which is very impressive			2
' though she 's surprisingly loud she 's a lovely cat and we 'd hate for it to stop her being rehomed			2
' @entity8 went to the centre after her elderly owner had to go into care , and staff were shocked when they stroked her and she started growling like a dog			0
measurement : the loud cat has been clocked at more than 90 decibels using a sound meter app homeless : @entity8 is looking for a new owner and is currently living at a centre in @entity16 her purr , which is almost four time louder than the average cat , has been keeping other animals awake at night			1
@entity54 added : ' @entity8 purrs all the time			0
she just has to see someone and she starts purring			0
she purrs when she 's playing and she purrs when she 's eating			0
' we think @entity8 is a little deaf but that does n't stop her enjoying life			0
she 's such a happy , friendly cat and she will make such a loving companion			0
' the noisy cat is well above the official world record holder @entity65 , who was recorded at 67.7 decibels in march 2011 , but her purr has not yet been officially certified			1
contender : @entity8 must now register with @entity67 if she is to win the official world record a spokesman for @entity71 said : ' we 're intrigued by @entity8 's talent and we would welcome an application from his owners so we can look into their claim			1
' we would love to hear from them and strongly suggest they make an application for this record via our website			0
' however , @entity8 's new owner may have to take precautions , as scientists say noise levels over 90 decibels can cause hearing loss over a prolonged period .			1

@entity8 's purr has been measured at 93 decibels , which is louder than the official world record
the cat is currently in a centre in @entity16 and looking for a new home
her growls are so loud they stop other animals from *sleeping* *properly*
