by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 26 november 2013 @entity2 : 18:43 est , 26 november 2013 @entity4 intelligence officials say they are worried about a ' doomsday ' cache of highly classified , heavily encrypted material they believe former @entity11 contractor @entity9 has stored on a data cloud			1
the cache contains documents generated by the @entity11 and other agencies and includes names of @entity4 and allied intelligence personnel , seven current and former @entity4 officials and other sources briefed on the matter said			2
the data is protected with sophisticated encryption , and multiple passwords are needed to open it , said two of the sources , who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters			0
@entity11 intelligence leaker @entity9 speaks in august - officials from @entity33 and @entity4 intelligence are said to be terrified over a cache of secrets he has stored online the passwords are in the possession of at least three different people and are valid for only a brief time window each day , they said			1
the identities of persons who might have the passwords are unknown			0
spokespeople for both @entity11 and the @entity4 @entity44 declined to comment			0
one source described the cache of still unpublished material as @entity9 's ' insurance policy ' against arrest or physical harm			1
@entity4 officials and other sources said only a small proportion of the classified material @entity9 downloaded during stints as a contract systems administrator for @entity11 has been made public			1
some @entity58 officials have said privately that @entity9 downloaded enough material to fuel two more years of news stories			2
' the worst is yet to come , ' said one former @entity4 official who follows the investigation closely			2
@entity9 ( 3rd @entity63 ) receives the @entity64 ( @entity65 ) in @entity66 alongside @entity33 @entity68 journalist @entity67 ( 3rd l ) who took @entity9 from @entity70 to @entity71 earlier this year @entity9 , who is believed to have downloaded between 50,000 and 200,000 classified @entity11 and @entity33 government documents , is living in @entity73 under temporary asylum , where he fled after traveling to @entity70			1
he has been charged in the @entity4 under the @entity75			0
@entity76 , a website which started publishing leaked secret documents years before the group @entity68 or @entity9 surfaced , estimated that the total number of @entity9 documents made public so far is over 500			0
revelations : @entity83 , was among the first to reveal @entity85 's vast electronic surveillance program - and the @entity11 fears he and @entity9 may reveal more secrets given @entity9 's presence in @entity71 , and the low likelihood that he will return to the @entity4 anytime soon , @entity4 and @entity33 authorities say they are focused more on dealing with the consequences of the material he has released than trying to apprehend him			1
it is unclear whether @entity4 or allied intelligence agencies - or those of adversary services such as @entity73 's and @entity98 's - know where the material is stored and , if so , have tried to unlock it			1
one former senior @entity4 official said that the @entity98 and @entity73 have cryptographers skilled enough to open the cache if they find it			1
@entity9 's revelations of government secrets have brought to light extensive and previously unknown surveillance of phone , email and social media communications by the @entity11 and allied agencies			2
that has sparked several diplomatic rows between @entity85 and its allies , along with civil liberties debates in @entity115 , the @entity4 and elsewhere			0
among the material which @entity9 acquired from classified government computer servers , but which has not been published by media outlets known to have had access to it , are documents containing names and resumes of employees working for @entity11 's @entity33 counterpart , the @entity126 ( @entity126 ) , sources familiar with the matter said			1
the sources said @entity9 started downloading some of it from a classified @entity126 website , known as @entity131 , when he was employed by @entity132 and assigned to @entity11 in 2012			0
compromised : the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) logo is displayed in the lobby of @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138 @entity9 made a calculated decision to move from @entity132 to another @entity11 contractor , @entity140 , because he would have wide - ranging access to @entity11 data at the latter firm , one source with knowledge of the matter said			0
@entity83 , who met with @entity9 in @entity70 and was among the first to report on the leaked documents for the @entity149 newspaper , said the former @entity11 contractor had ' taken extreme precautions to make sure many different people around the world have these archives to insure the stories will inevitably be published			0
' ' if anything happens at all to @entity9 , he has arranged for them to get access to the full archives , ' @entity83 said in a june interview with the @entity162 website			0
he added : ' i do n't know for sure whether has more documents than the ones he has given me ... i believe he does			0
' in an email exchange with @entity167 , @entity83 , who has said he remains in contact with @entity9 , affirmed his statements about @entity9 's ' precautions ' but said he had nothing to add			2
officials believe that the ' doomsday ' cache is stored and encrypted separately from any material that @entity9 has provided to media outlets			2
leaked : headquarters of the @entity179 ( @entity33 @entity179 ) located on the @entity180 along the @entity181 conservative @entity33 politicians , including @entity184 , a former member of parliament , have accused the @entity149 , one of two media outlets to first publish stories based on @entity9 's leaks , of ' trafficking of @entity126 agents ' names abroad			2
' no names of @entity33 intelligence personnel have been published by any media outlet			0
after @entity33 officials informed the @entity149 it could face legal action , the newspaper disclosed it had destroyed computers containing @entity9 material on @entity126 , but had provided copies of the data to the @entity202 and the @entity4 nonprofit group @entity203			1
sources familiar with unpublished material @entity9 downloaded said it also contains information about the @entity133 - possibly including personnel names - as well as other @entity4 spy agencies such as the @entity210 and @entity211 , which operate @entity4 image - producing satellites and analyze their data			1
@entity4 security officials have indicated in briefings they do not know what , if any , of the material is still in @entity9 's personal possession			1
@entity9 himself has been quoted as saying he took no such materials with him to @entity73 .			0

@entity33 and @entity4 intelligence officials say they are worried about a top - secret cache of highly classified documents that @entity9 may still release
one source described the cache of still unpublished material as @entity9 's ' insurance policy ' against arrest or physical harm
one former senior @entity4 official said that the @entity98 and @entity73 have cryptographers skilled enough to open the cache if they find it
