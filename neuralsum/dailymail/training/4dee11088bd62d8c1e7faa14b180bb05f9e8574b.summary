' environment secretary @entity239 and members of the @entity34 study the flood defences at @entity70 upon @entity67 , @entity242 flood - hit communities will continue to get @entity245 support but will have to wait a while longer for a deal to be done on affordable insurance cover , the environment secretary has said			1
@entity239 , who was touring flood defences in @entity242 today , praised the response of emergency services and the @entity34 for reacting ' heroically ' to recent national flooding triggered by the wettest year on record			1
he said the government had already committed to funding schemes protecting about 145,000 homes , and was putting more money into defences			0
' over the spending review period ( to 2015 ) we had already pledged £ 2.71billion and on top of that the chancellor already announced in his @entity263 a further £ 120million to protect a further 60,000 homes , ' he said			0
mr @entity239 also said partnership schemes had raised another £ 72million from the private @entity266 , he said there has been no deal done yet with the @entity269 ( @entity269 ) over the issue of affordable flood insurance for householders in areas of high risk			1
negotiations have been going on since last year to replace the current agreement , known as the statement of principles - which ends in july - but so far the @entity245 and the @entity269 have been unable to come to terms			0
mr @entity239 said his colleague , @entity279 , a cabinet office minister , met the director - general of the @entity269 before @entity33 , ' and we await them coming back to us with a constructive proposal '			2
he added he was ' not going to negotiate in public ' but said the government wanted ' a system which is better , comprehensive , and which is affordable and does not burden the taxpayer '			0
mr @entity239 said making flood insurance affordable was ' a huge and complex problem ' and he would not set a date for the conclusion of talks			2
we are confident we can reach a resolution , ' he said			0
the £ 120million of funding - the first tranche of which will be released in the coming financial year - is split equally , with half going towards major flood defences that protect infrastructure , homes and businesses			2
the other £ 60million is being allocated through a partnership fund which allows businesses , councils and developers to pay towards some of the costs of defences			0
about 20 new schemes are already going ahead this year , in locations including @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 , said @entity314 , the @entity34 's head of strategy and investment			0
he said the additional government money would be allocated on a ' case - by - case basis ' and areas would need to bid for the cash			0
' we go to an area and look at the causes of flooding and then look to see if solutions can be provided for those causes , ' he said			2
' if councils want to go it alone we can offer them support , but it 's a national pot of money and they 'll be participating against everyone else for it			0
' between 7,500 and 8,000 households have been flooded since july , culminating in the major flooding over @entity33 and @entity115			2
mr @entity314 also said about 100,000 homes had been protected from incidences of flooding over the same period because of the construction of more defences , better weather forecasting , and closer working between the emergency services , councils and the agency , sparked by the huge floods of summer 2007 .			2
