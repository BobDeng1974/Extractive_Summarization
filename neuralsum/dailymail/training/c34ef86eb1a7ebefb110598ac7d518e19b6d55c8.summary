a @entity1 health authority poster claiming @entity2 can be transmitted by droplets through the air has been removed from its website , prompting concerns the deadly virus can be caught through a sneeze			1
the poster , which caused alarm because it seems to go against medical advice that the virus can not be transmitted by air , said @entity2 could be contracted if someone came into contact with objects that had been sneezed on by people who were infected			1
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) poster said droplets , such as those from a sneeze , carried the virus and could remain infectious on surfaces for up to several hours			1
the @entity17 image which shows their warning that droplets from a sneeze could transmit @entity2 debate about government - imposed quarantines for people exposed to the virus has grown over the past few weeks , as isolated cases are diagnosed in the @entity1 and it continues to spread across @entity31			1
so far , more than 4,900 people have been killed - the vast majority in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 - in the deadliest outbreak of the virus on record			0
the @entity17 poster , now removed , stated : ' droplet spread happens when the germs traveling inside droplets that are coughed or sneezed from a sick person enter the eyes , nose or mouth of another person , ' the @entity39 reported			1
it warned someone could become infected should they accidentally touch the sneeze droplets and then touch their eyes , nose or mouth			0
today , the @entity17 internet page dedicated to the subject stated it was being updated			2
it read : ' the what ’s the difference between infections spread through air or by droplets ? fact sheet is being updated and is currently unavailable			2
please visit cdc.gov / @entity2 for up - to - date information on @entity2			2
' medical experts have repeatedly stated the ebola virus is not transmittable by air			1
it is contracted when someone comes into contact with the body fluids , such as urine , saliva , sweat , feces , vomit , breast milk and semen , of a person who is infected			0
an image of the ebola virus , which has killed nearly 5,000 people in @entity31 and recently reached the @entity1 but experts have repeatedly warned of the frightening possibility the ebola virus could mutate and become airborne			1
although the risk of it doing so is thought to be low , experts can not discount it entirely			0
two weeks ago leading scientist lord @entity91 warned the risk of @entity2 spreading could dramatically increase if it becomes airborne			0
in a @entity96 debate , the fertility doctor demanded answers from the government about how closely they were monitoring the virus			0
lord @entity91 said : ‘ we know that viruses mutate , we know that the ebola virus can mutate			1
‘ we know perfectly well that it is not airborne at the moment , and we know that the pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract cells are unlikely to harbour the virus			0
‘ however , can you assure us that people are looking at the risk of mutation of this virus so that we can make certain that its mode of transmission does not change ? ' and the chief of the @entity117 ’s @entity2 mission , @entity118 , also warned earlier this month that the virus could become airborne			2
he said aid workers were racing against time to control the epidemic in case it mutates in a ‘ nightmare scenario ’			0
health workers in @entity34 pictured suiting up to continue working around people who have caught the virus			0
