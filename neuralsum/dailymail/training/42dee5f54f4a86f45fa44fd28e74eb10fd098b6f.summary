a love of fatty , unhealthy , junk foods is causing an obesity epidemic in @entity7 and costing the @entity22 millions to help tackle the problem , dr @entity8 proposed a 12p tax on soft drinks , claiming it could save up to 2,000 lives a year as people switch to healthier alternatives			1

dr @entity8 said : ' we are in the grip of an obesity epidemic			1
we , as a nation , are eating too many calories			2
' we use taxes to discourage drinking and smoking			2
' it raises lots of money for the treasury and prevented people from dying too early			0

' i do n't care whether it 's hot or cold , whether you got it from a takeaway or a shop - i 'd like us to tax all unhealthy foods from butter to biscuits			0
