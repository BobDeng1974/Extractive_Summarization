by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:15 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 10:18 est , 5 november 2013 @entity4 's launch of a space craft is proof it no longer needs @entity7 aid , campaigners have claimed			1
@entity9 ’s orbiter mission – part of a £ 600million space programme – blasted off this morning with an orbiter which will survey @entity13			2
but the @entity15 ’ @entity14 said it was wrong for a country to explore other planets while receiving @entity7 aid , in @entity4 ’s case £ 280million a year until 2015			1
lift off : a screen grab of live footage taken from @entity4 television channel @entity23 during its coverage of the launch soaring : the rocket , which is also called @entity28 's @entity27 , is seen in the first part of its flight from the @entity31 on the country 's east coast from a distance : a photographer captures the 1,350 - kilogram ( 3,000 - pound ) orbiter as it heads into space ‘ it ’s atrocious that taxpayers are still handing money to a country rich enough not just to have its own space programme , but one that is blasting off to @entity13 , ’ said @entity38 , the group ’s political director			1
‘ if @entity4 can afford this kind of expenditure then it does not need a penny of @entity7 taxpayers ’ money , especially when departments back home rightly have to cut their spending			1
‘ it ’s difficult for taxpayers to believe the @entity56 uses their cash wisely when they see it spent helping launch spacecraft to the red planet , rather than going to the world ’s poorest			0
’ ministers are committed to increasing overall aid spending by 30 per cent to £ 11.3billion this year and are expected to hit their target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid			0
anticipation : @entity67 ( @entity67 ) chairman @entity68 ( right ) watches the launch from mission control in the island of @entity72 nerves : visitors to the @entity75 in @entity76 watch the live broadcast of the launch bystanders : customers in a tv showroom take a break from their shopping to watch coverage of the launch unlike spending on policing , prisons and defence , which have been slashed to cut the deficit , the aid budget has enjoyed year - on - year increases			2
by next year , the bill will be £ 12.6billion a year – more than the £ 12.1billion spent on policing			0
but a recent poll found more than 60 per cent of voters believe the cash is wasted			0
@entity4 spends vast sums on defence and even has its own overseas aid programme , which cost £ 328million a year			2
under @entity99 , @entity4 became the biggest net recipient of @entity7 aid , receiving £ 421million in 2010			1
despite the country ’s rapid economic development , then international development secretary @entity102 decided to approve a further £ 1.1billion in aid over the following four years			2
demonstrations : guests at the planetarium look at the rocket 's planned trajectory preparations for launch : engineers making their final preparations before the launch if the rocket reaches @entity13 , @entity4 will become only the fourth country or group to reach the red planet after @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 last year his successor @entity123 announced the outlays would end in 2015			1
@entity4 ’s then finance minister @entity126 embarrassed the government by suggesting @entity7 ’s aid payments were ‘ a peanut in our total development expenditure ’			1
if successful , the space mission will put @entity4 in an elite group of four , with the @entity121 , the @entity133 and @entity120 , to have sent space craft to @entity13			1
the mission follows the launch of a lunar craft in 2008			0
@entity138 , a leading development economist , has said : ‘ it seems to be part of the @entity4 elite ’s delusional quest for superpower status			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity56 said : ‘ not a penny of @entity7 taxpayers ’ aid money has gone on @entity4 ’s space programme			1
' @entity4 ’s recent progress means that all financial grants from the @entity7 to @entity4 will cease in 2015 , after which we will focus on providing help in the form of private sector expertise and technical assistance that will also ultimately benefit @entity7 businesses and jobs			1
' @entity158 – another country with a space programme – also receives @entity7 aid , worth £ 300million this year alone			1
@entity163 's @entity162 - 10 rocket blasts off from the @entity165 space centre in june @entity4 's bid to be the first nation since @entity120 , the @entity121 and the @entity133 to reach @entity13 could spark an @entity169 space race			1
experts say its ambitious space programme has been fuelled by competition with @entity163 and concerns about its neighbour 's civilian and military space technology			0
‘ the reality is that there is competition in @entity169			0
there 's the angle of the potential space race , ’ said @entity177 , senior fellow at the @entity178			0
although @entity4 's programme is largely for peaceful purposes , it has increasingly realised the need to grow its deterrence capability after @entity163 's 2007 anti-satellite missile test			2
‘ that was a wake - up call for @entity4 , ’ said @entity177			0
‘ until then we were taking it easy			0
’ @entity163 's space programme is far ahead of @entity4 's , with bigger rockets , more launches and equally cost - effective missions			2
it is working to create a space station and in june sent a manned rocket - the @entity162 - 10 - to the @entity200 ( @entity201 ) 1 , a trial space laboratory module			0
both @entity163 and @entity4 launches have been carefully staged to boost national pride			0
president @entity205 told the astronauts : ' you are the pride of the @entity163 people , and this mission is both glorious and sacred			0
' @entity4 's mission was announced on the country 's @entity211 last year , soon after @entity163 's bid to reach @entity13 failed			1
dr @entity214 , professor at the @entity215 , told @entity216 : ' i believe @entity4 's leadership sees @entity163 's recent accomplishments in space science as a threat to its status in @entity169 , and feels the need to respond			2
' however officials have dismissed the suggestion that @entity4 raced to prepare tuesday 's launch to trump @entity163 's failed attempt at @entity13			1
‘ we 're not in a race with anybody , ’ said @entity67 spokesman @entity228 , noting that the voyage can happen only every 26 months , when the spacecraft can travel the shortest distance between @entity232 and @entity13			0
‘ the mission to @entity13 has to be organised whenever there is an opportunity available			2

aim is to see if @entity4 has the ability to explore the solar *system*
no country has been fully successful on its first mission to the @entity13
more than half the world 's attempts to reach @entity13 have failed
@entity249 *criticised* for giving @entity7 aid to @entity4 which will end in 2015
