by @entity0 @entity2 legend @entity1 believes @entity3 is the perfect man to restore the club 's faded fortunes			1
the former goalkeeper , who played at @entity7 between 1991 and 1999 , is an admirer of the @entity10 's courage in making decisions other managers would never take			1
for example , in @entity16 's @entity15 quarter - final with @entity17 , @entity13 replaced goalkeeper @entity19 with penalty specialist @entity20 just moments before the shoot - out and his team duly prevailed on spot - kicks			1
backing : @entity1 believes @entity3 is the right manager to restore @entity2 to the pinnacle of the @entity26 and admires his gutsy decision - making new man : @entity3 was appointed new @entity2 manager following the disastrous @entity31 era the @entity32 told the @entity33 : ' @entity13 did one or two things in the @entity15 which were quite noticeable and have put his name right up there			1
they were things no one else ever dared to do			0
' so he looks to be his own man who knows exactly what he wants to do			0
i think we should be contending for the title again this season under him			0
' he has always been someone who is at a big club like @entity48 and @entity49 and done good things			0
hopefully he can do the same at @entity2			0
' @entity52 pedigree : @entity13 guided @entity53 to @entity55 success back in 1995 bold decision : in @entity16 's @entity15 quarter - final with @entity17 , @entity13 replaced first choice goalkeeper @entity59 with @entity20 ( second right ) , who duly won them the penalty shoot - out legend : @entity1 made over 300 appearances for the @entity7 club between 1991 and 1999 @entity13 arrives at @entity7 with a proven track record - he has won seven league titles in three countries and the @entity55 with @entity53 in 1995			1
he guided @entity16 to third place at the @entity15 in @entity70 this summer before taking up his post at @entity2			0
the @entity10 favours an attack - minded 3 - 5 - 2 formation and this is likely to provide plenty of entertainment in the @entity26			2
