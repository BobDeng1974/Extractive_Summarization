@entity1 midfielder @entity0 has admitted he is ' not happy ' with his bit - part role in the @entity5 champions ' side under @entity6			1
the former @entity8 man , who moved to @entity9 last january for £ 19million , played just 15 minutes of the 1 - 1 draw with @entity11 at the weekend , and has n't been at the forefront of @entity6 's mind			1
@entity0 has had to settle for the bench on a few occassions this season , and with @entity1 struggling for form with three league wins all season , the @entity5 international says he is not used to being left out			1
@entity0 ( right ) in training with the @entity5 national team ahead of their @entity24 qualifiers he told @entity26 : ' you have to accept being a substitute , but i do n't resign myself to that			1
in training sessions , i have to give my best and show my desire to play			0
' when i am on the pitch , i feel it is not perfect and that i often have to leave too soon			0
but i know the coach and staff have to make choices and i respect that			0
' have i spoken to @entity6 ? no. what do i tell him ? i am 28 years old and not new to the job			2
but i am not satisfied with the situation			0
' am i completely happy ? to be honest , no. it is a new situation for me , but i do n't complain			0
it is the first time i have n't played regularly for my club			0
' with the @entity5 team , if one day the national team coach decides to play me less because i do n't play often enough for my club , then i would need to take stock with my representatives			2
' @entity0 could be back in the @entity49 by january , having left @entity8 10 months ago @entity0 ( left ) , a £ 19million signing , came on in the 71st minute of the famous 3 - 2 win over @entity51 with @entity0 suggesting he is unhappy in @entity52 , a host of @entity49 clubs will be on alert in an attempt to prise him away in january			1
@entity57 were thought to be heavily interested in @entity0 before he left for @entity1			1
he said : ' do i sometimes miss @entity58 ? yes			0
sometimes i think about it , but i immediately sweep that away because it would cause distraction			0
' i am at the @entity62 and i need to find the right atmosphere			0
' many @entity8 fans will have predicted this outcome when their star midfielder left @entity67 , while @entity0 will assume his price tag alone will have secured him a more regular place in the team			1
@entity0 came on in the 71st minute of the famous 3 - 2 win over @entity51 last week , and endured a torrid start to the campaign after being sent off in the 0 - 0 draw at @entity75 in august			2
@entity0 played 21 games for the club last season , scoring just once			2
@entity57 manager @entity81 may be on alert at @entity0 's comments in the @entity5 capital @entity0 says @entity6 's decision must be respected and he will fight for his place in the team @entity88 could have done better than @entity1 - @entity89			1
