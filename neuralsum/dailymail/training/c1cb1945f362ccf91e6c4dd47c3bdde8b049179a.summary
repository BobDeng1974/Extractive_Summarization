by @entity0 last updated at 9:54 am on 6th july 2011 the decision to slash more than 1,400 jobs at @entity4 ’s last train - maker after the government ’s award of a major contract to @entity8 was met with uproar yesterday			1
the axing of posts at @entity12 in @entity13 sparked a renewed ‘ @entity4 jobs for @entity4 workers ’ row as ministers conceded more needed to be done to create ‘ a level playing field ’ with @entity16 rivals			1
unions condemned the move as ‘ the ultimate stupidity ’ , ‘ a scandal ’ and ‘ a tragedy ’ at odds with the government ’s pledge to make ‘ made in @entity4 and created in @entity4 ’ its watchword			2
devastated : @entity12 staff arrive at work this morning where they were told the firm was shedding 1,400 jobs			1
the decision comes after the government 's decision to award a lucrative carriage contract to @entity37 of @entity8 local mp @entity38 said the decision was the equivalent of reading the last rites to the @entity4 rail industry			1
@entity44 business spokesman @entity43 called it a ‘ body blow ’ for @entity4 manufacturing			0
but transport secretary @entity48 blamed @entity44 for the decision to award the order , part of the £ 6billion @entity53 project in @entity54 , to @entity37 of @entity8			1
he claimed the way in which the last government had drawn up the procurement contracts to comply with @entity16 trade rules had put @entity4 interests at a disadvantage			1
he noted that ‘ @entity62 governments routinely award contracts for trains to @entity62 builders and the @entity8 award contracts for trains to @entity8 builders ’			1
mr @entity48 and business secretary @entity69 have written to the prime minister urging a change in the way contracts are awarded to give @entity4 manufacturers ‘ a level playing field ’			2
under @entity16 rules , the @entity76 can not discriminate against bidding companies from other member states			1
but in their joint letter , mr @entity48 and mr @entity69 say other @entity16 countries ‘ appear to manage their public procurement processes with a sharper focus on domestic supply chains than we have hitherto ’			1
blame game : @entity12 in @entity13 say the 1,400 job cuts are directly as a result of the government 's decision , a claim denied by ministers it says the @entity4 must , in future , play the same game as our @entity16 rivals , helping our domestic companies as far as possible while still staying within the rules			1
the @entity37 bid was chosen because it gave ‘ best value for money to the taxpayer ’			0
the government said it would create up to 2,000 @entity4 jobs at the @entity37 factory in @entity109 , @entity110 , and two planned maintenance depots			1
@entity112 , general secretary of the @entity114 transport union , accused the government of ‘ colluding with the @entity16 in a policy of industrial vandalism that would wipe out train building in the nation that gave railways to the world ’			1
disagreement : @entity114 chief @entity112 ( left ) says the government will wipe out train building in @entity4 but transport secretary @entity48 ( right ) says the job cuts are not fully the result of the decision to hand the contract to @entity128 just four months ago , @entity129 dragged the whole @entity130 to @entity13 , centre of @entity4 engineering excellence , to extol the virtues of rebalancing the economy away from finance towards high quality manufacturing			1
today , the prime minister has to confront the hugely embarrassing fact that one of @entity13 ’s key businesses , train - maker @entity12 , is preparing for its demise in @entity4 because @entity142 has awarded the biggest new contract to make rolling stock in years to @entity8 rival @entity37			1
it really beggars belief that @entity12 could have lost out to the @entity8 for the £ 1.4billion @entity53 contract to build 1,200 carriages for the route between @entity150 and @entity151			1
yet the behaviour of the government in this travesty , which will lead to the loss of 1,400 skilled jobs in @entity13 , has been utterly pusillanimous			1
transport secretary @entity48 , portrayed before the 2010 election as a likely future star of a @entity160 government , suggests lamely that the decision is the fault of the @entity44 government			2
business secretary @entity69 , the minister who has placed himself at the heart of the ‘ growth agenda ’ , has responded by setting up what he terms an ‘ @entity168 ’			0
half of all jobs to go : chairman of @entity172 ( pictured ) helped announce the proposed redundancies today explanation time : chairman of @entity172 ( 2nd left ) talks to workers outside the assembly plant this afternoon no one should kid themselves this means the @entity181 is going to try to save the jobs or to reverse the ‘ preferred bidder ’ status given to @entity37 – indeed , @entity48 has said this is not possible			1
all it means is that a group of quangocrats has been asked to look at ways of ‘ mitigating ’ the economic impact of the disaster			0
past experience – from , for example , the closure of @entity194 under @entity44 in 2005 – suggests that resources are made available to help those made redundant find jobs , but after the initial furore dies down the assistance vanishes into the mists			2
the real tragedy of the @entity53 decision is that it would never have happened if @entity4 had put the national and public interest first , as our @entity207 counterparts do			0
as a country we remain honourably committed to free and open capital markets			0
but this has allowed overseas firms not only to pick off our best companies but also to win open tenders for valuable contracts – and often with the help of their own governments			0
our competitors across @entity220 and the world do not operate on the same basis of free and open trade			0
economic patriotism , looking after home - based industry and making sure it is first in line for important national contracts , is the priority in @entity231 , @entity232 and even @entity233			2
dejected : this lunchtime @entity12 workers who could lose their jobs walk past a train built at their @entity13 plant there is no better example of how @entity4 has lost control of its own economic destiny than the loss of our train manufacturing @entity246 would have been delighted to receive the @entity53 contract			1
but because it is a minor subsidiary of a huge @entity250 - based outfit which also makes planes , winning a contract in @entity4 , on the outer fringe of its empire , would be considered relatively unimportant			2
the tragedy is that we in @entity4 once led the world in train - making			0
in the 1990s , @entity259 ( part of the @entity262 ’s @entity261 ) was one of the most successful train manufacturers on the planet			2
operating out of the @entity267 , it was a world leader in high - speed locomotives and train systems			0
but @entity262 ’s successor , lord @entity270 , was n’t interested in old - style manufacturing and invested in telecoms instead			0
the company ’s half - share in @entity259 was sold to its @entity62 partner and , as night follows day , train production went with it			1
this left @entity12 as the sole representative in the @entity4 of @entity4 train - making skills			2
i have no doubt that @entity12 did its best to win the @entity53 contract			1
but the best for a relatively small , anonymous subsidiary of a @entity250 - based company is simply not good enough			0
@entity262 was often criticised for being too cautious			0
but when it came to winning @entity4 government contracts for @entity261 and preserving engineering and manufacturing jobs in @entity4 , there was no one better			2
he and those who worked alongside him believed big @entity4 engineering and manufacturing contracts should always go to @entity4 companies			0
as a result , @entity262 developed an extraordinary network of contacts inside government and the civil service to make sure this happened , and he would take his case personally to the prime minister of the day			2
such hard work and patriotism paid off			0
he also recruited as his chairman former @entity160 minister lord prior , who became a super salesman for @entity4 industry overseas			0
job cuts : commuters crowd onto a @entity53 service in @entity54 , whose new carriages will now be made by a @entity8 company , leading to the cutting of 1,400 jobs at @entity4 manufacturer @entity12 @entity262 was , quite simply , the greatest of advocates for @entity4 and its high - tech and engineering capabilities			1
but when great @entity4 companies are sold overseas , leaders like him are lost			0
however committed they might claim be to the @entity4 market , foreign companies ensure their own domestic interests come first			0
that is why we should be so disturbed that a series of great companies with the word ‘ @entity4 ’ in their name , including @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 and @entity336 , have ended up in foreign hands			0
what really matters when a firm is plundered by an overseas buyer or when a contract is awarded to a foreign competitor , is that it is not just the jobs at the central company , like @entity12 , that are lost but those down the supply chain			1
for every coach built by a train - maker there are hundreds of manufacturers making each component part			0
if you cut the main contract , tens of thousands of more jobs right down the line are sacrificed as well as the skills to do them			2
in the case of @entity12 , it is pathetic for the government to claim that the decision to buy @entity8 - made rather than @entity4 trains can not be reversed			1
chancellor @entity363 has declared he wants the words ‘ made and created in @entity4 ’ to drive the economy forward			0
he and his fellow ministers now have the opportunity			0
with the right amount of willpower , as the great @entity4 industrialists of the past demonstrated , governments and civil servants can be persuaded – and even ordered – to favour home - grown engineering and industry			0
failure by the government to reverse the @entity53 decision will mean this nation will be doomed to import all of our railway rolling stock forever more , and will signal that we are giving up the ghost on being a world - class manufacturer .			0

one in two staff at the @entity13 plant set to lose their jobs
government say @entity12 told them job cuts *inevitable* *irrespective* of contract *disappointment*
lucrative contract going abroad raises questions about @entity16 rules as @entity62 and @entity8 always employ home manufacturers
