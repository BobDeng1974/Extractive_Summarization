fans did n’t know what to do or where they should go			2
the final whistle went in @entity5 , @entity3 were @entity6 champions for the second time in 12 months and after two absurdly dramatic hours the realisation dropped out of the @entity9 night as suddenly as a falling star			1
the match in @entity12 had been such a frantic and joyous mess that nobody with a dog in @entity3 ’s fight dared to secondguess their emotions			1
when @entity24 brought 80 - plus minutes of frenzied farce to a finish in @entity12 , the hundreds of @entity20 fans who had congregated around a big screen outside the @entity23 stadium were stunned			1
for a while they did nothing but roar			0
beer accounted for it in most cases , but their reactions were , shall we say , a deal less sharp than those of @entity38 and @entity39 earlier in the day			2
@entity3 players celebrate as they are crowned @entity6 champions at @entity42 captain @entity43 holds aloft the @entity6 trophy after @entity3 were crowned champions it took supporters several minutes to stop screeching and turn and lurch back towards the stadium , where the presentation took place within ten minutes of the cessation in @entity5			1
events moved with the suddenness of a palace coup , and @entity3 took the crown watched by 5,000 delirious countrymen and women who eventually scrambled back into the ground			1
it was dark night by now , but the inky gloom thrown by cold @entity23 concrete did n’t bother them			0
they would have raised a party on @entity65			0
eventually a camera caught the @entity20 players in the tunnel , in their suits but hugging and kissing as if the final whistle had just sounded on a cup final			2
they bounded on to the pitch , cheers poured off the south stand like water and they went to the presentation stage			0
there , @entity77 lifted the @entity6 trophy high above his head and his colleagues leaped around him			1
the suits and the jubilation lent the scene the look of a @entity86 celebration photo			0
but there was more to this than luck			0
two bizarre hours had to be put in by @entity90 and his team as @entity92 and @entity93 competed like a pair of boxers with big fists and no guard , but they had put in a couple of outstanding hours of labour themselves before then			1
the @entity20 squad celebrate their @entity6 success as fireworks are set off from within @entity42 @entity20 fans celebrate their side winning the @entity6 after watching @entity92 beat @entity93 55 - 35 in @entity12 they did n’t fluke their way to the nighttime joy that created a terrific racket in the well - appointed neighbourhoods around the home of @entity23 rugby			1
they earned their right to truly unique celebration circumstances			0
these days become in memory an account of inevitable success			0
in years to come , when the events of saturday march 21 are considered , it will seem like the outcome was irresistible			0
an @entity3 title retention will in the telling become a certainty from early in the day			1
but in the bumpy , brittle second - to - second reality of a sporting contest like this , where every point must seem more precious than a gulp of oxygen , there are 50 - 50 splits throughout the game			2
there are incidents where the story of the day could be decided , a missed tackle , an ambitious break , a crooked throw			2
little dramas mushroomed over the 80 minutes and you watched and wondered which one would eventually represent this taut and extraordinary saturday : there was the early try of @entity77 , playing arguably his best @entity144 at the age of 35 , the lion roaring through winter			1
@entity39 was not at his best in @entity147 but rumbled back to it here , and his first try was a triumph for the man but also for the coach as a variation on a lineout move @entity90 employed at @entity155 befuddled @entity156			1
@entity157 of @entity3 goes over to score the second try in a 40 - 10 win at @entity42 as @entity39 crossed , the thought occurred that this moment combining personal triumph and coaching imagination might be the microcosm of the day			1
but the seesaw would n’t rest , and when @entity166 was snared short of the @entity23 line in the second half , it had the look of a memory that would cause fans to grind their teeth			2
an even more troubling portent recurred , and it was the nine points @entity3 left unclaimed after two penalty misses by @entity177 and one , with the last act of the match , from @entity181			1
@entity3 were harvesting big numbers against their helpless opponents but large totals are best gathered by letting no opportunity slip			1
in failing with those three kicks the @entity20 out halves were in danger of being trapped in history the way @entity191 has : this was truly @entity3 ’s greatest performance under @entity90 captain @entity77 scored the first of @entity3 ’s four tries in @entity20 rugby ’s historic day in @entity42 , with flanker @entity197 ( pictured right with @entity177 ) crossing twice and @entity198 also going over to end @entity200 hopes of winning the title			1
@entity3 players celebrate at the end of the match at @entity42 before later being crowned champions @entity39 , who was named man of the match , said : ‘ i think we executed very well and did all we could do – and hopefully it goes our way			1
it was important we came out and expressed ourselves			0
driving into the ground and seeing all the @entity20 support put a chill up our backs			2
‘ we had to go out and stick to our process , try and win the game first and foremost and let the scoreboard look after itself			0
’ a substantial career reduced to a lapse			0
for @entity191 , it happened eight years ago this month when he tapped a quick penalty under his own posts as @entity3 were on a points ’ hunt against @entity226 in @entity227 , in vain pursuit of the championship			1
the ball got turned over , @entity226 scored and @entity93 squeezed to the title			2
that cruelty would more likely be visited upon @entity181 because he is the less experienced man , and has not put in the kind of trophy - laden service that @entity177 has			0
he was in danger of being pointed out by the crude and the obvious as @entity3 ’s spoilsport , but there was none in green on saturday			2
@entity3 's @entity157 scores a try during the 2015 @entity6 match at @entity42 in @entity9 this was the outstanding performance by @entity3 under @entity90 so far			1
it was better than the @entity247 match because it was more sustained			0
the two rivals can not be compared , but the results can			0
@entity3 lost to the @entity250 but they won here			2
both matches were portraits in excellence but the work was completed on saturday			0
the clock turned towards 8pm and outside the ground , a terrible singer with a guitar belted out awful songs			0
as @entity90 returned to the media room , the dismal troubadour was singing ‘ @entity262 ’			0
he at least got that much right .			0

@entity3 crowned 2015 @entity6 champions after dramatic final day
@entity3 beat @entity156 40 - 10 at @entity42 to move into driving seat
@entity92 's 55 - 35 win over @entity93 not enough for @entity271 's men
@entity3 fans in @entity9 watched the drama *unfold* at @entity5
