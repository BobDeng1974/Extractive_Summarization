by @entity0 @entity1 last night declared himself entirely at ease with the prospect of being reunited with @entity4 at @entity5			1
@entity1 ’ tenure as @entity8 boss ended in 2007 shortly after a dressing room containing the midfielder allegedly took their misgivings about their manager ’s approach to chairman @entity16 ’s door			1
last week , however , @entity4 attempted to defuse any potential problem in a transatlantic call to manager @entity19 in which he told the @entity20 he fully endorsed @entity1 ’ impending appointment as his no 2			1
new man : @entity1 has put any old disagreements behind him as he prepares to get started at @entity5 and yesterday @entity1 also declared there was no issue by detailing the ringing endorsement he gave @entity4 when @entity28 inquired about him shortly before his £ 4.4million move to @entity30			1
‘ it ’s important we nail that , ’ @entity1 stated			1
‘ i never had any problems with @entity4 when i was @entity8 manager			2
‘ he was brilliant for me and that ’s why he got his big move to @entity5			1
accepted : @entity1 and @entity4 are ready to work together again , this time with @entity5 under @entity39 ‘ i actually played a little part in him coming here as @entity28 asked me : ‘ what ’s the boy @entity4 like ? ' i gave @entity28 a glowing reference and told him to make sure he did n’t miss out on him			1
to pay what it would take to get him as he was a top player			0
he ’s my type of player			0
he trains properly and has developed into a leader and captain of @entity5			1
‘ @entity19 asked me if there were any problems between myself and @entity4 and i told him there were no problems whatsoever			0
’ finally unveiled as @entity19 ’s assistant yesterday , @entity1 revealed he had rejected several advances to return to the front - line since leaving his role as @entity60 ’s director of football a year ago			1
the chance to return to @entity30 18 years after his departure for @entity63 proved just too tempting though			0
captain 's orders : @entity4 gave @entity1 ' appointment at @entity5 his blessing after a phone call from @entity39 ‘ you always hope as a player when you leave such a big club , and great club , that one day you ’ll come back , ’ the 46 - year - old added			1
‘ so , i ’m delighted to be here			0
it ’s a great opportunity			0
coming to @entity5 now is a different feeling than it was when i signed as a player			2
as a player , you are only thinking about yourself			0
‘ as a coach , you are thinking of everything			0
you are thinking about all of the players and the staff , about different training sessions			0
‘ i have had offers to come back in but it ’s never been right			0
’ meanwhile , @entity19 ’s first game in charge of @entity5 will come against @entity91 outfit @entity90 on july 3 after the club confirmed details of their @entity95 tour			2
that friendly in @entity97 will be followed by a visit to old foes @entity100 three days later			0
they face @entity102 on july 8 before completing their @entity95 stay with a july 11 game against @entity106 side @entity105 in @entity107			2
key : @entity4 celebrates last season 's @entity109 title win with the fans - and will be expecting the same this season			2

@entity114 's assistant puts old argument to one side ahead of reunion
@entity5 captain has given @entity1 ' appointment his blessing
