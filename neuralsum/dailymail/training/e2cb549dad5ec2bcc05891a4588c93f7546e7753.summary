by @entity0 published : 14:43 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 23 may 2013 a couple have spoken of their disbelief after just one of their disabled identical twin sons , who both have @entity7 , was granted vital disability benefits while the other was refused			2
@entity10 and @entity11 , both 10 months old , share the exact same medical conditions and need the same round - the - clock care			1
but a government ruling has found that only @entity10 was entitled to @entity15 of £ 76 per week			1
mum @entity16 , 33 , said the decision had left her ' gobsmacked ' because the boys , born just one minute apart , share exactly the same medical issues and require round - the - clock care			1
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) , both 10 months old , who share the exact same medical conditions with mother @entity16 spot the difference : @entity16 with identical twins @entity10 ( left ) who has qualified for disability benefits and and @entity11 ( right ) who has been refused despite having exactly the same medical condition @entity16 and her mechanic husband @entity28 , 45 , of @entity29 , @entity30 , said the benefits are vital for both of the boys who need daily physiotherapy , and require frequent hospital visits			1
they have identical heart , lung and eye complications and they are expected to have problems walking as they grow older			2
after making individual applications for @entity15 on behalf of the twins @entity16 and @entity28 said they were amazed to find that @entity10 had been accepted for support and @entity11 had been refused			1
@entity16 , a sports centre supervisor , who has three other children from a previous relationship , said at first she was so shocked she thought there must be a mistake			2
she said the only explanation the family has received so far is that the officer who assessed @entity11 felt the tot did not need any more support than a normal 10 - month - old			1
she said : ' a specialist midwife told me about the help you can apply for , so i sent off two applications for them six weeks ago			2
the applications were identical , just like them , they had the exact same information on them , i may as well have photocopied the first			1
peas in a pod : both boys have @entity7 and need the same round - the - clock care , but a government ruling has found that only @entity10 was entitled to @entity15 of £ 76 per week confusion : @entity16 's letters advising her that @entity10 will get @entity15 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) ' i now wish i had put them in the same envelope , but i needed to apply for them separately as individuals			1
' i explained that they each needed 24 - hour care , we have at least one hospital appointment each week , physio practice every day with the special equipment needed			1
they already have specialised chairs and tables at home because i need to carry out the physio on them every day			2
' we also have sensory items and a @entity90 machine which monitors their breathing during the night			2
i attached all the proof of this			0
' as they grow , they will obviously need even more care and attention , so the £ 76 a week would help towards the cost of all that			1
' two weeks ago i received a letter back regarding @entity10 which said he had been accepted to receive the £ 76 a month towards his care			1
i was so adamant that @entity11 would get the same result that i actually went into work and told them i could now work part - time because i was then able , with the extra help , take care of my children at home myself , since i know the specialist care and attention they need			1
condition : the twins have identical heart , lung and eye complications and they are expected to have problems walking as they grow older treatment : both of the boys need daily physiotherapy and require frequent hospital visits a government ruling has found that only @entity10 was entitled to @entity15 of £ 76 per week ' but then i got a letter through a couple of days later and i was shocked to read that @entity11 had been declined			1
' how could my two sons , who are identical in every way , not receive the same help ? being accepted for @entity15 and being registered disabled is essential to ensure you can then continue being supported as they grow up , receiving extra carers and equipment			1
' when they are three - years - old , they wo n’t be able to walk properly , as they have problems with muscle deficiency , so we may need a disabled blue parking badge to park closer to the shops - it ’s these little things that will make a massive difference to our lives			1
' at first @entity146 laughed it off thinking they must have got confused thinking we were claiming for the same child , since the initials are the same			0
' but when i rang up about @entity11 they said he would n’t need any more help than any other child his age			1
what 10 - month - old baby needs to have physio every day ? we have appointments every week - that is not normal for children of their age			1
bump : mrs @entity16 poses while pregnant with the twins ' i then told the woman that bizarrely they had accepted my son ’s identical twin for the allowance , who had the exact same issues			1
' her answer was that somebody would call back - within 14 days			1
she made me feel like i was someone who was ripping off the benefits system or something - we ’ve worked every day since we could			2
' it ’s not good enough			0
what worries me is that if it was two children from two separate families , one could be accepted and the other not			0
it ’s a lottery game - the staff are being inconsistent and i want to highlight that issue			2
they obviously do not go by the same criteria , which is wrong			0
' @entity11 actually has more problems than his brother - he has bad eyes and will probably need to wear glasses at a young age			1
' we need a bigger house because there is five kids in here including them			2
we ’re looking for somewhere with a garden so they can play outside			0
' i just want my boys to have the best possible start in life and the same chance to do so			0
if they do n’t develop properly now , then it could really have an effect on their future			0
the money would even help towards them going to special nursery classes before they head to school			0
i ’m just so angry about the situation			0
they are identical twins , born a minute apart			0
' i need to be with them every minute of the day , it ’s not easy and it ’s just going to get more demanding when they are older			0
i do find it an absolute pleasure to look after them , but to know the extra help is there would be a relief			0
' i would give anything for my boys			0
i was told they will always need a carer throughout their entire lives , they will never be able to even cross the road without someone by their side			0
' we only have a three up two down terrace at the moment , but we ’ve had an offer			0
they have affected all aspects of our lives			0
i ’ve had to give up my horse @entity240 in the last few months because i just do n’t have the time anymore to ride her			2
' a @entity243 spokesperson said that , while it was not possible to comment on specific cases , the claims would be checked to see if they had been assessed correctly			0
the spokesman said : ' @entity15 is n’t generally paid on the condition someone has , but because they have specific care and mobility needs			1
all young children have care and mobility needs , but parents can claim @entity15 for children who need a lot more help or supervision than other children of the same age			1
' anyone who disagrees with a decision can ask the @entity243 to look at the case again , presenting any new evidence , or appeal			0
' father @entity265 with his two sons disability charity scope said the case highlights a ' shocking ' flaw in the application process			0
a spokesman said : ' it certainly suggests it is a bit of a lottery when you put an application in			0
if these twins live in the same situation and their care needs are exactly the same then the outcome should have been the same for both boys			2
' the fact that it was n’t means there was either a blunder here , or different assessors are judging cases differently			0
' disability living allowance is the main benefit for disabled people to help with the extra costs they face as a result of their disabilities			0
it was replaced last month for adults with the new @entity295 , but continues for under - 16s .			2

@entity10 and @entity11 , both 10 months , share the exact same medical conditions
they both need the same round - the - clock care including daily physiotherapy
but only @entity10 entitled to @entity15 of £ 76 per week
