by @entity0 published : 13:47 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 20:42 est , 15 november 2013 @entity1 last night became the first major economy to abandon the greenhouse - gas promises made in the @entity4			1
in a setback for the @entity8 talks on climate change this week in @entity10 , @entity5 announced it will let emissions rise 3 per cent above 1990 levels by 2020			1
@entity5 ’s announcement came as @entity14 said there was growing evidence that climate change caused extreme weather such as the @entity20 typhoon			2
he said politicians should listen to scientists who say man is to blame and take ‘ preventative steps ’			0
@entity8 delegates have warned that plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions globally and reduce climate change could be threatened by @entity1 's decision to scale back its emissions target ( file picture ) energy secretary @entity32 said @entity1 ’s decision was ‘ deeply disappointing ’ and a ‘ major step backwards ’			1
however some @entity35 mps called for the @entity36 to follow @entity5 ’s lead			0
@entity1 , which hosted the @entity4 , had promised to cut emissions by 25 per cent			1
but the fifth biggest producer of greenhouse gases said the original targets could not be met following the decision to mothball its nuclear plants after the @entity45 disaster in 2011			1
the country ’s chief government spokesman , @entity46 , said the 2020 target of a 25 per cent cut was ‘ completely baseless ’			2
the loss of a quarter of its power production leaves @entity1 more reliant on high - polluting coal and gas			1
it insists the change to the target is temporary , while it resolves its energy supply issues , and it still intends to halve emissions by 2050			1
@entity36 , which derives about 20 per cent of its energy from nuclear , is on track to cut carbon emissions by 34 per cent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels			2
it has a legally binding target to cut them by 80 per cent by 2050			2
@entity1 has shifted back to a reliance on coal , oil and gas for power after an earthquake wrecked the @entity45 nuclear plant in 2011 , pictured mr @entity32 said : ‘ it is deeply disappointing that the @entity1 government has taken this decision to significantly revise down its 2020 emissions target			1
' this is inconsistent with the unequivocal message from the scientific evidence , which clearly underlines the urgency of addressing emissions reductions			2
’ @entity36 has committed to build a new generation of nuclear power stations , which will help cut emissions ; the first deal was signed for a reactor at @entity88 in @entity89 last month			1
but they will take years to produce power and @entity35 @entity92 are concerned that meeting climate targets with green taxes on homes and businesses , and building expensive wind farms , will harm economic growth			0
mr @entity14 has already promised to ‘ roll back ’ green taxes on household bills this year - although they are expected to be put into general taxation instead			0
@entity102 , a @entity35 mp and former trade minister who sits on the @entity106 energy and climate change committee , said : ‘ this is part of a pattern			0
we have seen @entity111 resile from its climate targets , @entity113 abandoning green taxes , now @entity1 , and i think we will see something similar in @entity116 which is clearly going to be unable to reach its ambitions for the same reason as the @entity1			1
the climate talks are taking place in @entity10 , @entity122 , pictured			2
@entity124 delegates ' expressed disappointment ' at the new figure , while @entity8 climate chief @entity127 said there was ' regret ' over @entity1 's decision ' you can not say it makes any sense for @entity36 ... to continue trying to set an example by crippling our industry with high costs and our customers with unbearable bills			1
unilateral energy disarmament can only handicap us			0
' mr @entity14 ’s comments , made on his trip to the @entity145 conference in @entity146 , will anger some @entity35 backbenchers , a growing number of whom question the link between man ’s actions and global warming			0
influential grandee @entity154 said this week that it was ‘ a scare ’ to suggest that @entity156 , which is thought to have killed up to 10,000 people in the city of @entity160 alone , is linked to climate change			0
environment secretary @entity162 has also accused environmentalists of getting ‘ emotional ’ about global warming			0
mr @entity14 said governments should act even if there was a 40 per cent chance that climate change had nothing to do with extreme weather			0
he added : ‘ i ’ll leave the scientists to speak for themselves about the link between severe weather events and climate change			0
the evidence seems to me to be growing			0

new target calls for reducing emissions by *3.8* *%* from 2005 level
@entity8 delegates in @entity10 express disappointment at change
@entity1 turned back to coal , oil and gas after @entity45 power plant wrecked
