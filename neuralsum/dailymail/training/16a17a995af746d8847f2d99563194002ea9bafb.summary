there was no rimshot in the @entity3 crowd , but former @entity5 presidential candidate @entity4 told a devastating joke at president @entity8 's expense on sunday during a campaign stump speech for @entity11 hopeful @entity10			1
the partisan audience stepped on his punchline , but the former @entity15 governor did n't seem to mind			2
' @entity8 went to the bank to cash a check , ' @entity4 began			1
' he did n't have his @entity18			2
and the teller said , " you 've got to prove who you are			0
he did n't have his @entity18			2
so he set up a little cup on the ground , took a golf ball , putted it right into that cup , so we knew it was @entity30			0
we cashed the check "			0
' " ' and then @entity38 came in , " ' @entity4 continued , in the voice of the fictional bank teller , ' " and @entity38 did n't have his id either			1
he put up a little target on the wall , took a tennis ball and a racket , hit it onto that target time and again			0
we knew it was @entity38 , so we cashed his check "			0
' at this point in the story , the teller asks @entity8 to follow suit			1
' so she said , " is there anything you can do to prove who you are ? " ' ' and he said , " i do n't have a clue			1
" the crowd went wild , thinking that was the end of the joke			0
but the punchline was yet to come			0
' and she said , ' well , mr. president , do you want your money in small bills or large bills ? ' " @entity68 , a @entity5 @entity3 state senator and a lt. col. in the @entity70 , is battling against four - term @entity73 @entity72 congressman @entity71 for the @entity75 seat being vacated by longtime @entity73 sen. @entity76			2
tanned , rested and ready ? @entity4 , the 2012 @entity77 also - ran , says he 's not running for president again â€“ but his poll numbers may be too good for the @entity5 to leave on the table the @entity5 needs to flip six @entity11 seats to take control of the upper chamber of @entity84 , and most observers predict it will happen			1
the @entity86 on monday gave @entity5 a 94 per cent chance of pulling off the electoral feat , which would give them free rein over all of @entity84 during @entity8 's last two years in the @entity77			1
@entity68 leads @entity71 by a razor - thin 1.2 per cent , according to the average of polls published by @entity92 , but she has been gaining momentum since the end of september .			0

@entity4 was stumping for @entity11 candidate @entity10
joke made *fun* of @entity8 , *suggesting* he could be *identified* without an id if he admitted ' i do n't have a clue '
former @entity5 presidential candidate *insists* he is n't running for office again , but his *favorability* numbers among @entity5 voters remain high
@entity5 needs to flip six @entity11 seats on nov. 4 to take control of both houses of @entity84
