stunned shoppers were showered with sewage when an overfilled septic tanker blew up			2
the passers - by sought medical attention after having their faces covered in foul - smelling brown sludge in @entity7 , @entity8 - and the owner of this shop was even less fortunate			1

sludge : unsuspecting shoppers were showered with slurry when a septic tanker blew up in @entity19 , @entity8 eyewitness @entity20 told local television : ' i noticed some people gathered in the street and thought there had been a car accident			1
' i was n't really paying attention , but then the smell hit me			0
' then i realised that a tank filled with some disgusting brown liquid had exploded , scattering it all over the street and the people who were shopping or walking past			1
' at one of the shops , just about every item on display was covered in brown liquid			2
the shopkeeper was highly agitated			0
' he complained that everything was ruined and said he needed to shut the business for a week to clean up the mess			0
' stench : some walked away from the scene covering their noses , while others sought medical assistance any hope of compensation looks futile however - because the firm which made the truck has blamed the firm which operated it , and vice versa			1
a spokesman for the company that handles the collection and storage of waste in the south western city said the incident was caused by a technical fault with the vehicle			1
the company said those affected should seek compensation from the vehicle manufacturer			0
the manufacturer , meanwhile , told local media that explosions typically result from poor maintenance and failure to follow the proper operating instructions			0
police said the contents of the truck had mainly been from local sewers , but it also emptied septic tanks from public toilets from time to time			0
spokesman @entity83 said : ' no - one suffered physical harm , but many of those covered sought medical attention for fear that chemicals used in the cleaning process , or indeed diseases from the sludge , could cause harm to those affected by the blast			1
' stuff happens : but the operators of the sewage tanker ( pictured ) blamed its manufacturers , and vice versa			2

at first eyewitnesses in @entity7 city thought there had been a car accident
but when they got *closer* , they found a tide of foul - smelling brown sludge
*payouts* look unlikely after lorry and waste firms each blamed the other
