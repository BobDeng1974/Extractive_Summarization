it looks more like a rocket than a bicycle			2
however , this amazing machine aims to become the fastest human powered vehicle in the world			2
its @entity7 inventors claim it can reach over 87mp/h - with just a single rider			1
called @entity12 , it is being created by a team of students			2
its @entity7 inventors claim it can reach over 87mp/h - with just a single rider			1
the rider is reclined inside the vehicle , which has a complex series of gears to reach maximum speed the shell is made of carbon fibre standard bike wheels and tyres are used			1
the rider will also rely on a video camera to see , as the cockpit is entirely enclosed			1
' our mission at @entity34 is to inspire creativity in the public and challenge the norms of conventional design by doing more with less , ' the team , led by @entity40 & @entity41 , said			2
it has previously created human powered helicopters and planes			2
' each year we recruit a student - based team to tackle a high - profile , thought - provoking engineering project			1
' this year we will break the human - powered speed record at 133.8 km / h ( 83.1mph ) by building the world 's most efficient bike , @entity52			1
' the bike will , they claim reach speeds similar to a car			1
' for perspective , our human - engine will produce at maximum 1 @entity59 , 100 times less than the average car , but innovative engineering will allow our bike to achieve a car â€™s highway speeds			1
@entity65 , an early version of the design , at @entity68 , @entity69 , where it reached speeds of @entity71 ( 125 km / h )			0
' it all comes down to efficiency , which is actually the reason that the bike is called @entity52			0
' @entity52 is the @entity76 letter often used in engineering as the symbol for efficiency			0
' the team have spends months on the design , reducing or eliminating the forces that are resisting our forward motion			0
' by streamlining the body ( ie. making a smooth contour with no massively separating turbulent vortices ) we can reduce the aerodynamic forces by about 20 times , ' they say			0
' our team is deep into detailed design and prototyping , and will have the vehicle ready for the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) in @entity68 , @entity69 this september , ' they say			0
' beyond challenging the world record , we calculate that our incremental improvements in aerodynamics , mechanical efficiency , and rolling resistance will make it possible to achieve speeds in excess of 140 km / h ( 87 mph )			0
' the firm is using off the shelf components where possible			0
' wherever possible we 've prioritized mature technologies and used novel design and better optimization / analysis to achieve the desired performance gains			0
' we have budgeted an extensive portion of our timeline for testing - to shake down the design , work out the bugs , and be ready to break the world record			1
' backers can go to @entity120 to help fund the project , which is aiming to raise $ 30,000			0
the team has undertaken hundreds of computer simulations to ensure the vehicle is as aerodynamic as possible a rendering of @entity52 showing the internal configuration , structure , and preliminary mechanical design - including the giant gear wheel			1
