31 - year - old @entity9 mother suffered a stroke when 15 weeks pregnant
tests *revealed* she was brain dead but the foetus was still healthy
rather than switch the life support machine off , doctors left it on until the 27th week of pregnancy , when the mother 's *physical* health *declined*
baby born by @entity145 and mother 's life support turned off 2 days later
despite weighing only around 3lb , baby is now doing well , doctors say
