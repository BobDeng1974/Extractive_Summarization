by @entity0 published : 21:02 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 08:28 est , 3 march 2014 warning : @entity2 said police and social services are often too hampered by political correctness to act the children of @entity8 radicals should be taken into care , @entity2 said last night			1
the mayor of @entity11 said hundreds of children were at risk of being turned into fanatics by extremist parents			0
but he warned that in many cases social services and the police are simply too influenced by ‘ absurd ’ political correctness to take them into care			1
mr @entity2 said young people were increasingly being ‘ radicalised at their home ’ and taught the sort of ‘ crazy stuff ’ similar to the views espoused by the killers of @entity29			1
he said lack of clarity about the law meant the authorities were reluctant to intervene			0
the mayor wrote in the @entity35 : ‘ a child may be taken into care if he or she is being exposed to pornography , or is being abused – but not if the child is being habituated to this utterly bleak and nihilistic view of the world that could lead them to become murderers			0
‘ it is the strong view of many of those involved in counter-terrorism that there should be a clearer legal position , so that those children who are being turned into potential killers or suicide bombers can be removed into care			2
’ the mayor drew parallels about the way in which political correctness hampered action by citing the @entity61 ’s revelations about senior @entity63 politicians , the @entity64 and its affiliation with a paedophile organisation			1
he said : ‘ look at the case of @entity68			0
you may ask yourself how on earth this relatively astute politician could have allowed her organisation to be affiliated to a body that brazenly called itself the “ @entity74 ”			0
' the answer – which @entity76 would do well to admit – is that back in the @entity78 she got into a complete intellectual fog			0
’ he said many young people are being taught ' crazy stuff ' like the views of @entity84 and @entity85 who murdered fusilier @entity29 with no remorse and have since been jailed he said the @entity64 , in search of minorities to protect , came across the @entity74 and ‘ mushily decided ’ the group must have protected status			1
mr @entity2 said there were thousands of counter-terrorism officers working doing a ‘ fantastic job ’ to keep the public safe			2
they had to work out which vulnerable young people were most at risk of radicalisation			1
the mayor wrote : ‘ that will sometimes mean taking a view about what is happening to them in their homes – and i worry that their work is being hampered by what i am obliged to call political correctness			2

' young people taught ' crazy stuff ' like extreme views of @entity29 *'s* killers '
warned against political correctness hampering action of counter-terrorism
