by @entity0 the next generation of safety technologies designed to reduce the number of road accidents , have been revealed at the @entity6 motor show			0
@entity7 used a life size acrylic car ' driven ' by models to demonstrate how it is working towards semi-automated driving as well as other new technology innovations to keep drivers and car passengers safe			1
the company believes cars will be packed with more intelligent safety systems in the next decade that can anticipate road conditions			1
@entity7 used a life size acrylic car ' driven ' by models to demonstrate how it is working towards semi-automated driving as well as other new technology innovations @entity7 showed off a range of airbags and active safety systems such as braking and steering products in the acrylic car , which also highlights the sensors that are used to collect information from 360 degrees around the vehicle			1
the data from the sensors is used to make driver assist systems work in a bid to protect drivers , passengers and pedestrians in emergency situations			0
included in the acrylic car is an advanced radar that can be used to warn drivers of possible collisions and pedestrians , as well as spark mitigation braking and emergency braking			2
a new ' active ' seat belt system is fitted in the vehicle but in a real car that is forced to stop suddenly , it could help manage occupant energy during a crash			0
the new seatbelts can reduce slack in driving situations and decrease the possibility of passengers being out of position and more susceptible to injury , the company said			0
the company believes cars will be packed with more intelligent safety systems in the next decade , some of which it showed off in its car at the @entity6 motor show an integrated brake control system ( @entity66 ) enables a car to automatically brake and recover energy from braking in one package			1
the company said it offers ' improved pedal feel ' and performance over conventional systems with a lower overall weight			0
another feature shown off in the vehicle is an electrically powered steering system that offers fuel - saving benefits and factors in wind compensation , for example			0
@entity7 showed off an advanced radar in its acrylic car that can be used to warn drivers of possible collisions and pedestrians , as well as spark mitigation braking and emergency braking			1
the see - through car highlights lots of different safety systems including airbags @entity93 , chairman and ceo of @entity7 , said : ' over the next decade , active safety systems will become increasingly intelligent as greater efforts are made to reduce the number of road fatalities worldwide			1
' more automated functions will be introduced that will operate continuously in certain situations in addition to providing emergency support when needed			0
' he believes consumers will benefit from more cars being fitted with active safety technologies as changes to road safety schemes and insurance incentives come into force across the world			2
@entity7 currently supplies safety technologies to car manufacturers including @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			2
the company 's stand at the automotive show also used holographic films to showcase its new technologies			0
@entity93 , chairman and ceo of @entity7 , said : ' over the next decade , active safety systems will become increasingly intelligent as greater efforts are made to reduce the number of road fatalities worldwide '			1
