the police are giving the public tips on how to spot a potential terrorist in a drive to encourage people to report suspicious behaviour			1
leaflets given to commuters by officers this morning include six things which should set alarm bells ringing , including someone with a lot of mobile phones , vague travel plans or taking a keen interest in cctv cameras			1
it comes after ministers urged the public to be ‘ vigilant ’ and warned @entity20 is at ' very significant risk ' from a terror attack by extremists inspired by @entity25 jihadists in the wake of the atrocities in @entity28			2
leaflets given to commuters by police today include six things which should set alarm bells ringing and urge them to report anything suspicious to specialist counter-terror officers commuters arriving at @entity37 this morning were handed the flyers promoting the confidential anti-terrorist hotline , which advise the public : ‘ do n’t rely on others			1
if you suspect it , report it			0
’ it makes clear that specialist counter-terror officers should decide whether something suspicious is important and could help to prevent an attack			1
the leaflet adds : ‘ everyone has a role to play in helping to prevent terrorism			0
you can do this by remaining vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to the police			0
’ it sets out six types of suspicious activity to report to police , including : the @entity59 said the leaflets being handed out today were part of ongoing measures to educate the public and not a change in approach			1
@entity20 's threat level was raised from ' substantial ' to ' severe ' in august last year following the gains made by @entity68 in @entity69 and @entity70			0
it means an attack is ' highly likely ' , one level below ' critical ' which means an attack is considered imminent			0
in the hours after the terror attack on the @entity28 offices of satirical magazine @entity77 , extra armed police were deployed across @entity78 , including in @entity79 and at @entity81 train station			1
the flyers were handed out to commuters arriving at @entity37 this morning as part of ongoing measures to increase vigilance police and security agencies have warned it is ‘ almost inevitable ’ that an attack will be launched in the @entity20 by fanatics radicalised by @entity25			2
foreign secretary @entity90 warned last week that @entity25 , also known as @entity25 and @entity68 , poses ‘ probably the greatest single immediate threat to @entity20 's national security ’			0
speaking at a counter-terror conference in @entity78 , he said : ‘ there 's a very significant risk of an @entity25 - inspired attack being planned and , if we are not successful in intercepting it , executed by @entity25 sympathisers who live in the @entity20 but are inspired by what is going on in @entity70 and @entity69			2
' of course , our security and intelligence agencies , our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor , to identify , to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature , and we 've been very successful in doing so , but we must n't be complacent			0
' we know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack			0
' in the wake of the terror attacks in @entity28 earlier this month , armed police were deployed to sites across @entity78 including @entity81 station the leaflets distributed today strike a more low key note than a campaign launched in november last year telling commuters what to do in the event of a @entity126 - style terrorist attack at one of @entity20 's busy terminals			1
after government warnings that the threat to @entity20 from @entity133 fanatics is ' greater than ever ' , officers handed out leaflets telling the public to ' run , hide and tell ' if they are caught up in an attack			2
the flyer , which has been attacked as ' scaremongering ' by critics , shows images of worried - looking people running down flights of stairs , cowering in the dark and anxiously talking on their mobile phones .			1
