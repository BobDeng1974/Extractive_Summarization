controversial : @entity0 , who appeared on television show @entity1 to work family doctors could be offered bonuses for weighing thousands of patients under @entity7 proposals to tackle obesity			1
they would be given financial incentives for recording the weight of anyone with an underlying health problem triggered by being overweight			1
based on existing incentives , the payments could range from £ 1,500 to £ 15,000 a year per gp surgery depending on how effective they are deemed at helping the @entity7			1
the plans have been drawn up by health watchdog @entity18 in the hope of ultimately saving the @entity7 billions of pounds by treating complications caused by obesity			1
the news of the proposals comes amid increasing controversy over the cost of obesity to the state			2
this month @entity29 documentary , benefits : too fat to work featured couple @entity0 and @entity31 , who say their weight prevents them from working			0
between them they weigh 54 stone and receive around £ 1,700 a month in benefits			0
a quarter of adults in @entity41 are considered obese and our rates are the second highest in @entity44 , only surpassed by @entity45			0
although there are no accurate estimates of the cost of obesity to the @entity7 , it spends £ 10billion annually treating type 2 diabetes alone			1
but senior doctors said the proposals were just a ‘ box - ticking ’ exercise which would just overburden gps with more paperwork without actually benefiting patients			1
in october last year , similar plans to pay @entity55 a £ 55 bonus for each dementia diagnosis in a bid to boost detection were condemned as an ‘ ethical travesty ’			1
the obesity payments would form part of a bonus scheme called the @entity67 , or @entity67 , whereby extra cash is given to surgeries for treating illnesses such as heart disease and depression			0
gps would be urged to record the body mass index ( @entity75 ) once a year of anyone with high blood pressure , asthma , heart disease , arthritis or who has previously had a stroke or heart attack , which are commonly triggered by obesity			2
the @entity75 is the measurement of a person ’s weight in relation to their height and a reading of 25 or above is considered overweight while 30 or higher is obese			0
@entity18 stressed that the proposals are still in the very early stages and would now be considered as part of a month - long consultation , along with incentives for other conditions			2
if approved , they would be passed on to officials at @entity100 who would negotiate with senior doctors at the @entity102 on how much the incentives should be worth and what targets should be met to earn them			2
but based on existing incentives , they could range from £ 1,500 a year up to £ 15,000 a year depending on how effective they are deemed to be at tackling obesity			1
doctors across the @entity41 could be offered financial incentives - ranging from £ 1,500 to £ 15,000 a year - for recording the weight of anyone with an underlying health problem triggered by being overweight ( file picture ) the payments would then be offered from next year – although they would go to surgeries , rather than to gps directly			1
a spokesman for @entity102 said : ‘ we would need to see the details of the proposals and ensure that they have real clinical value , rather than being a box ticking exercise that place yet another pointless administrative burden on overstretched gp services			0
’ but gp @entity126 , chairman of the @entity128 , said the plans did n’t go far enough , as @entity55 should be focusing on weighing patients who do n’t yet have a health problem – so it could be prevented			1
he said : ‘ it ’s all in the wrong direction			0
it ’s people without a diagnosis for one of these conditions who need to be screened			0
’ the @entity67 consists of targets covering a range of conditions including heart disease , dementia and cancer			0
a maximum of 1,000 points is available for every practice per year , and each point is worth £ 157			0
but experts have warned it has offered limited benefit to patients as it encourages doctors to focus on conditions which merit payments .			2
