if you want to join the latest celebrity selfie trend , not only can you go make - up free , you can have messy hair too because nobody will be looking at your face			2
this season , the celebrity selfie is all about the nails			1
in the last few weeks everyone from @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 has posted a ' nailfie '			1
some star talons are spectacularly bejeweled but the big trend among the nailfie posters is the nude look			1
her gem encrusted forefinger added some razzle - dazzle to the otherwise subtle look			0
but one celebrity who definitely was n't going for subtle is @entity10 , who posted her colourful , glitzy manicure on @entity42 two days ago			1
