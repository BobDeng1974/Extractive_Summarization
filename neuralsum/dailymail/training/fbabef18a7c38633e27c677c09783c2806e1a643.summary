by @entity0 @entity2 police are searching for two people wanted in the kidnapping of a toddler girl in the back seat of a car stolen last week from a downtown gas station			1
the assailants , both black males , were in another stolen car wednesday night when they pulled into the @entity13 station just before 10.30 p.m. and one jumped out and stole the car with the baby inside , surveillance video showed			2
the tot was dumped on a nearby sidewalk and scooped up by a good samaritan , according to police , but neither the stolen cars nor the suspects have been found			1
‘ who would get out and run into a gas station and leave your car running ? more so , who would leave their child inside of a car ? so , this is something that may have and could have been prevented if somebody had just taken a little more precaution , ’ said @entity40 commander @entity39			2
‘ never leave your child alone in a car that 's running			0
first and foremost , that 's one thing you do n't want to do , ’ added @entity40 sgt. @entity52			0
video shows the father walking inside the gas station as the thieves roll into another pump in a stolen @entity26			1
the theft : he is seen here opening the door to the @entity67 , the car 's headlights and windshield wipers are noticeably on when the occupant is inside the store the switch : the man circled was the passenger in the stolen @entity26 , he walks around to the front of the car while the other thief drives the @entity37 from the station ( bottom left corner ) his turn at the wheel : the @entity26 passenger jumps behind the wheel of the stolen car the driver of @entity26 then gets out and runs over to the @entity37 while his passenger casually exits the car and hops behind the wheel			1
the black male quickly drives the @entity37 away and the @entity26 follows close behind.the whole theft took less than 10 seconds			2
‘ this is a crime of opportunity , and it 's something that we as citizens should be more aware of , @entity39 explained			0
police sources said the @entity26 was similarly stolen from a @entity93 gas station only one block away			1
‘ it 's reported to us that a gentleman had exited his car at @entity99 right down on @entity100 and @entity101 , and then he went to the back to check his tire , and somebody got in his car			0
the car was left running , ’ @entity39 recalled			0
the car thief soon dumped the young child on a bleak street corner marked by a concrete wall and crooked fencing around a home abandoned after being damaged in @entity113 , said police			1
over and out : the @entity26 then follows the @entity67 out of the gas station - neither car has been seen since where it happened : the @entity13 gas station where the brazen theft occurred desolate : the nearly - abandoned block where the baby was found by a good samaritan before being brought to a local police station the person brought the girl to a nearby police station where she was reunited with her father , cops said			1
