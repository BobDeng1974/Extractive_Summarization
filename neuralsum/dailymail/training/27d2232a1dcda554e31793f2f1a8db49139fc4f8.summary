' millions of people have bought tablets during the last year but there is still around 75 per cent of the @entity47 population without one			0
' we know that tablets will feature heavily on @entity27 lists this year , ' said @entity51 , managing director of @entity1			0
' at just £ 99.99 the @entity36 is highly competitive with a great specification			1
' a spokesman added the device has been designed ' with teenagers in mind offering all the functionality of a traditional tablet with built - in parental controls for younger users			1
' it is powered by a @entity63 dual - core processor and has with a 1024 x 600 resolution lcd screen - giving the @entity36 a pixel density of 169			2
@entity1 claims it has a five - hour battery life			2
@entity68 rear , @entity70 front @entity71 from £ 99.99 * direct from retailers			1
prices may vary on third - party shops or during promotions * * currently £ 99 on offer although this pixel density is lower than @entity8 's @entity79 and @entity6 's @entity80 , it is six points higher than @entity83 's ipad mini			1
@entity9 comes with @entity29 of memory - half the basic storage of other 7 - inch tablets on the market - but does have a microsd port that supports an extra @entity89			1
@entity36 is available in pink , pictured , and silver			0
it goes on sale 16 october and is powered by a @entity63 dual - core processor elsewhere , the device has a built - in @entity96 - facing camera plus a low - resolution @entity98 - facing camera , and has @entity99 and @entity100			1
after @entity83 dominated the tablet market for years , @entity8 was the first major company to challenge the @entity102 and , in particular , the later @entity102 mini with the launch of its @entity14 by @entity105			1
it was a budget tablet that went on sale for £ 159 , compared to the ipad mini 's £ 269 , without compromising on the majority of features			1
the search giant launched a @entity14 successor earlier this year that cost £ 199 and came with the world 's highest resolution screen			1
@entity6 then took it a step further with the launch of its @entity119 tablet last month			0
the 7 - inch @entity119 costs just £ 119 and beats the majority of other budget tablets in terms of screen pixel density			1
it could even be bought for as little as £ 60 when purchased with @entity125 vouchers			2
at the launch , @entity6 insisted it had not cut corners to produce the budget tablet and claimed it would beat similarly priced competitors ‘ hands down ’			0
the @entity36 is available from 16 october from the @entity1 website , through the @entity1 app or high - street stores			1
@entity1 ' plans to pitch this tablet at younger people is a growing trend in the tablet market			0
a survey by @entity140 , commissioned by @entity142 's world - apps by @entity143 aimed at children - found tablets have become a must - have accessory for toddlers , with 50 per cent of the @entity47 ’s two and three - year - olds using one			1
it also found 61 per cent of three - year - olds and 38 per cent of two - year - olds play and learn on @entity102			2
tablet usage is often by more casual users of technology , who are likely to be using their device for social media , games and other lightweight means			2
most people want access to this type of technology but ca n't invest in a phone / tablet that gives them much more than they need			0
the budget alternative may be just what they have in mind			0
commenting on the rise of budget tablets , @entity170 , global director of gadget insurer @entity169 , told @entity174 : ' there will always be a market for luxe tablets like the @entity102 , favoured by early adopters and professionals , just as there will always be a market for budget , child - friendly slates			2
' the average @entity47 family does n't really care about having high - resolution screens , as long as they keep their kids quiet on long car journeys			2
' that 's why bargain - priced slates from trusted budget brands are worthy contenders for the booming two - tier tablet market			2
it 's likely we 'll see more sub £ 100 tablets emerge , but it 's unlikely they 'll match the quality of @entity12 and @entity36			2
' while @entity200 , technology expert at @entity201 , added : ' following the launch of @entity204 ’s pricey surface slates and @entity6 ’s pocket - money priced @entity12 , @entity1 ’ effort is more evidence of how diverse the tablet market is becoming			2
' with inevitable snobbery around retailer - branded devices , it 's highly unlikely image - conscious teenagers will want to be seen out and about with an @entity1 or @entity6 tablet			1
but young families who just want to keep kids entertained wo n't care			0
' the @entity119 and @entity36 have robust spec sheets , but are loss leaders for the retailers , so it 's unlikely we 'll see good quality entry - level tablets get much cheaper than £ 99			1
' but such a low price tag could spell the end of the humble laptop for some consumers			0
tablets are changing how and when we get online - and are truly portable			0
but it ’s unlikely that cheap tablets will fully replace smartphones			0
' @entity230 , creative consultant at marketing and technology consultancy @entity231 told @entity174 : ' @entity1 have hit the right price point			0
in this market the nuances of specs are less important than price			0
okay , it is less powerful than the @entity119 , but it is also £ 20 cheaper			0
@entity1 will heavily promote this through their channels and i expect tv adverts			0
i think they may be onto a winner			0
' @entity247 , associate strategist at digital agency @entity249 added : ' with the two devices being released at the same time and at a similar price point there 's the obvious danger they could split the market opportunity			0
' @entity6 seems to be better placed to generate revenues from the budget tablet space with all @entity119 devices coming pre loaded with its film subscription service @entity261			0
and given their marketing power it 's hard to see how the @entity119 wo n't be on everyone 's gift list come @entity27			0

the 7 - inch @entity9 costs £ 99.99 and will be on sale from 16 october
it runs @entity8 's @entity28 and comes with @entity29 of storage
