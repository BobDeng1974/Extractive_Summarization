by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 16:56 est , 20 august 2013 a couple looking to adopt a child have taken out a billboard on a busy highway to advertise their request			0
@entity7 and @entity8 , who did not reveal their real names , told @entity11 they want their adopted two - year - old son @entity12 to have a sibling , but that the time - consuming adoption process is even more difficult for a second child because birth parents tend to look for childless couples			1
to stand out from the crowd , the @entity23 couple bought a bright yellow billboard on the busy @entity26 , featuring a picture of themselves , their phone number , their website , and the words ' loving couple looking to adopt. ' desperate measures : @entity23 couple @entity7 and @entity8 , who did not reveal their real names , took out billboard ad space on the @entity26 advertising that they are looking to adopt complicated : they said they want their adopted son @entity12 to have a sibling , but that the time - consuming adoption process is even more difficult the second time around because birth parents tend to look for childless couples while @entity8 , a sales executive , and @entity7 , a doctor , hail from @entity23 , they chose to buy advertising space in @entity26 because birth mothers there only have 72 hours to change their mind			1
those in @entity23 , on the other hand , are given a full 28 days to reverse their decision			1
' we feel as a couple our goal is to market ourselves to as many people , ' said @entity8 , who has been married to @entity7 for six years			2
' to let them know there 's an option for their 16 - , 18 - , 20 - , or 25 - year - old young woman who is nâ€™t ready to be a mom			0
' the billboard , which just went up , will cost @entity8 and @entity7 a whopping $ 2,000 a month , but they believe it 's worth it if it leads to an adoption			2
indeed , they explained that the whole process of adopting @entity12 took about two years , but they have hope that their creative ad will make the process go a little faster this time			0
strategic : while @entity8 and @entity7 hail from @entity23 , they chose to buy advertising space in @entity26 because birth mothers there only have 72 hours to change their mind			1
in @entity23 , they have 28 days ' what we hope to find is that one unique situation where someone picks up the phone or goes to our website and says , " hey i can give a great gift to this couple , " ' said @entity8			1
on @entity85 , the website listed on the billboard , @entity8 and @entity84 put forth their case as good parents who would provide a loving home for another adopted child			0
the website states that they have a three - bedroom house in ' a neighborhood full of young families , ' and that one of the top elementary schools in the area is located just next door			0
' with 13 nieces and nephews all under the age of 13 , our second child will be surrounded by children eager to play , ' they add .			0

@entity7 and @entity8 are from @entity23 , where birth mothers are given 28 days to change their mind
to circumvent this , they bought advertising space in @entity26 , where the grace period is just 72 hours
