by @entity0 last updated at 1:53 am on 13th february 2012 wind turbines are a ‘ public menace ’ , the chairman of the @entity5 chairman has said			1
sir @entity6 dismissed wind as the ‘ least efficient ’ renewable power			1
the honest admission is surprising coming from the the head of the charity , as it champions green energy as part of its conservation work			2
‘ we are doing masses of renewables but wind is probably the least efficient and wrecks the countryside , ’ he said			2
@entity5 is concerned about the impact of 220m ( 721ft ) turbines on the environment and on views of the @entity25 ‘ broadly speaking , the @entity5 is deeply sceptical of this form of renewable energy			1
’ while the @entity5 officially continues to support ‘ a major increase in the @entity31 ’s renewable energy generation ’ , it is fighting several plans for wind farms , including one to erect a massive 417 wind turbines in the @entity25			1
the trust is concerned about the impact of the 220m ( 721ft ) turbines on the environment and on views of the coastline			0
@entity41 boasted that @entity31 had ' a lot to be proud of ' after the world 's biggest offshore farm opened it is also disputing the @entity47 ’s plans to build four 415ft turbines on his @entity49 in @entity51			0
the trust remains committed to its target to cut energy use by 50 per cent by 2020 , but sir @entity6 told the @entity56 this would largely be achieved through water power and biomass boilers , making the most of the acres of rivers and woodlands under its ownership			1
the revelation could be a major a blow to the @entity69 government , which has recently come to blows with the @entity5 over plans to reform planning law			1
last week @entity41 , who replaced @entity73 as @entity75 secretary , boasted that @entity31 had ‘ a lot to be proud of ’ after the world ’s biggest offshore farm – consisting of 102 turbines - opened off the @entity78 coast			0
up to 32,000 wind turbines could be built in @entity82 and @entity83 over the next 40 years to meet government targets			0
but last month it emerged that wind farms in @entity87 were paid nearly £ 300,000 in the first five days of this year to close down because it was too windy			0
four turbine operators shared the controversial ‘ constraint payments ’ because they produced more energy than the @entity91 could handle			2
last year 17 wind farm operators were paid £ 7m to shut down on 40 occasions between january and september .			0

@entity5 says it will cuts its energy use with water power and biomass boilers
