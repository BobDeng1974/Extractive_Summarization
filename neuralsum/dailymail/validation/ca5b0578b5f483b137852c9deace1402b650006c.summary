she may be known for her gleaming , blonde locks , but @entity2 has made no secret of the fact she ca n’t style her own hair			1
such is her love of a professional look , she invested in a chain of @entity10 blow - dry bars last year			1
the first branch has just opened in @entity12 , offering seven @entity14 hairdos inspired by the actress , who is also the creative director — all at just £ 28 a throw			1
the chain also has to satisfy her eco-credentials , so the salon does not use styling products that contain any chemical preservatives — called parabens — or sulphates			2
as a customer , all you have to do is point at the look you like best on the salon menu before you sit back for 45 minutes and sip a green tea as the stylist gets to work			0
fellow blonde @entity19 went along to try four of @entity2 ’s most distinctive styles , and see if it really is possible to get @entity14 hair on the cheap			1
@entity46 sleek volume : @entity2 rocked the ' sleek volume ' at the 2005 @entity49 ( pictured ) the style : the salon ’s name for this look is the @entity54			1
@entity2 rocked a similar look at the @entity49 in 2005			1
and even the shampoo the stylist is rubbing into my hair has @entity14 connections			1
the salon uses a range called @entity63 by @entity65 celebrity hairdresser @entity64 and is free from paraben preservatives and sulphates			0
it turns out this is the first of many products that i need to be red carpet - ready			2
there ’s a conditioner , then a mousse , followed by volumising spray			0
then a slick of another @entity2 favourite — argan oil			1
once my pampered hair has been rough - dried , my @entity24 stylist @entity80 divides it into small sections , rolling each one up into pin curls and securing them on my head with a grip			1
another blast with the hairdryer and these are gently unrolled			0
@entity80 then backcombs the roots before smoothing and separating the curls and fixing the whole look with a whoosh of hairspray			0
verdict : my hair has more energy and bounce than @entity2 after a pint of organic green juice			1
and it feels beautifully soft and natural rather than set and brittle			0
it ’s me , but with added va - va voom			2
result ! 5/5 @entity104 the style : this just - got - out - of - bed look , called @entity107 , is easy to achieve when you have your own @entity65 celebrity stylist on speed dial			1
but if my pillows could talk , they would swear blind they ’d never seen my hair looking like this first thing in the morning			2
@entity80 reveals @entity2 ’s secret — a salt - water spray to give the hair that matt , slept - in look			1
tousled tresses : this just - got - out - of - bed look looks easy to achieve but is actually far from it , @entity21 stylist @entity80 reveals salt - water spray is the secret to creating that slept - in look once she ’s sprayed this on and blow - dried my hair using a medium round brush , she twizzles small sections into tight twists , and winds them individually around the barrel of a tong , holding them in place with her fingertips for about 15 seconds each			1
‘ this gives more of a wave than a curl , ’ she says			0
she then gently brushes through the @entity141 - like tendrils to create a more relaxed effect , before fixing it with hairspray			2
verdict : i do n’t look ‘ sensual and innocent ’ , as promised on the salon menu			2
even ‘ messy beach waves ’ does n’t describe my hair at the end of 45 minutes			1
far from looking like the sexy surfer girl i had imagined , i am reminded of a bowl of spiral pasta			0
2/5 @entity151 the style : @entity2 is no stranger to an up - do			1
@entity80 says the key is ‘ all about prepping the hair for a sleek finish ’ , and i soon discover this involves lots of products , from leave - in conditioner to a ‘ @entity157 ’ which smoothes frizz			2
my hair is blown straight and pulled into a high ponytail			0
@entity162 : @entity2 showed off a classic updo in 1996 film , @entity165 ( left )			2
@entity19 ( right ) learnt that the key to this delicate look is preparing your hair for a ' sleek finish ' , which can involve a lot of products to create the topknot — @entity2 calls this look the @entity175 — the ponytail is divided into thick sections and tonged into a chunky curl to help coax a rounded bun shape out of my straight hair			1
as @entity80 works her way round the ponytail , she carefully fans out each section , spreading and pinning it to create the bun			0
when i look in the mirror through the fog of hairspray , i swear i can see @entity192			0
the menu ‘ guarantees this coif will get you what you want ’ , and it ’s true , my bun stays firm and perky all day , even winning a few compliments from strangers			0
4/5 @entity201 the style : @entity2 rocked a beehive at a @entity205 event a few years ago			1
but as i soon discover , this is a seriously high – maintenance look — not for nothing the salon calls it the @entity211 — that takes a lot of backcombing			0
@entity215 : another favourite of @entity2 's ( left ) is the beehive inspired ponytail			2
@entity19 ( right ) discovered that this seriously high - maintenance look took a lot of backcombing the vigorous brushing begins after my hair ’s been washed and dried			2
and i panic at the sight of the matted bird ’s nest on the top of my head			0
but minutes later @entity80 has pinned it back and miraculously smoothed away the coarse texture with a brush , while keeping all the volume			0
the lower lengths ( which were n’t backcombed ) are swept into a side ponytail and fixed with a minimal band			0
@entity80 then wraps a small section of hair around the band to cover it — the ultimate @entity2 touch			1
verdict : my ponytail looks a bit sparse compared with the enormous pouffe on top of my head			0
the menu suggests it is ‘ a polished look for an impromptu polo match ’			0
sorry , but there are none of those going on where i live			0
