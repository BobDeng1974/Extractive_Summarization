flying gas stations that can refuel robotic military aircraft have come a step closer			0
the first ever mid-air refuelling of an unmanned aircraft was today successfully achieved by the @entity7 's @entity6 drone			1
the @entity9 502 vehicle is one of two @entity12 demonstrators ( @entity13 ) on the @entity6 program			0
earlier today , the aircraft plugged its in - flight refuelling ( @entity20 ) probe into the hose of an @entity23 kc - 707 tanker off the coast of @entity25 earlier today , it plugged its in - flight refuelling ( @entity20 ) probe into the hose of an @entity23 kc - 707 tanker off the coast of @entity25			1
during the test , it trailed the @entity31 707 tanker from a mile off before using optical sensors and a video camera to monitor its approach to within 20 feet ( six metres )			1
depending on the weather , the aerial refuelling demonstrations are due to last throughout the weekend			1
the drone is about the size of an @entity40 , weighs in at 44,000 lb ( 20,000kg ) and has a 62ft ( 20m ) wingspan			1
@entity42 is one of two @entity12 demonstrators ( @entity13 ) on the @entity6 program the goal of each of the refuelling demonstrations is to transfer 3,000lbs of fuel in five minutes			1
but this is the final test of the historic @entity6 , which will now be donated to museums despite , according to @entity51 , only having 20 per cent of their flight hours used up			2
refuelling in flight is the last hurdle for the @entity57 - built jet , claims to captain @entity58 , program manager of the @entity7 's @entity59			2
with a wingspan of 130 feet , the @entity60 is wider than commercial airliners such as the @entity63 an airliner - sized @entity7 surveillance drone made its first transcontinental flight in september , flying 11 hours across the @entity67			1
the cross-country test was the first for the @entity60 , which will play a role in the @entity7 's planned @entity60 program			0
the drone can provide blanket surveillance for the @entity7 as part of the branch 's @entity60 program			2
@entity60 uses ' radar , infrared sensors and advanced cameras to provide full - motion video and photographs ' to @entity7 personnel			2
@entity57 says the unmanned aircraft also has a capacity to fly up to 28 hours at a time and surveil 1million square miles in a single mission			0
with a wingspan of 130 feet , the @entity60 is wider than commercial airliners such as the @entity63			0
mid-air refuelling is difficult enough for human pilots , but the ability for drones to do it could eman they only ever have to land for equipment updates			0
the @entity7 envisions the @entity6 's successors , the @entity97 drones , as making 24 - 7 patrols around aircraft carriers			0
' we will have met all of the program 's mission objectives and will [ take ] those lessons learned , fold them into the @entity97 performance specification , ' @entity58 said			0
the @entity6 drone is about the size of an @entity40 , weighs in at 44,000 lb ( 20,000kg ) and has a 62ft ( 20m ) wingspan			1

@entity42 trailed @entity31 707 tanker from a mile off
it used optical sensors and a camera to monitor approach to 20 feet
it then plugged its refuelling probe into hose of the @entity120
drone is size of an @entity40 and weighs 44,000lb ( 20,000kg )
