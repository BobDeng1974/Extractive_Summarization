peering into the heart of the @entity2 , astronomers have spotted the ' howls ' of dead stars as they feed on stellar companions			1
these zombie stars are thought to be leaving a ' mass grave ' of white dwarf stars near the centre of the @entity2			1
but why there are so many of these stars here - which are left behind when a larger star runs out of fuel - remains a mystery			1
the smaller circle shows the center of our galaxy where the @entity18 image was taken the finding , published in @entity29 , was made by scientists at @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 using @entity35 's @entity18 telescope			1
' we can see a completely new component of the centre of our galaxy with @entity18 's images , ' said @entity40 of @entity41 in @entity42			0
' we ca n't definitively explain the x-ray signal yet - it 's a mystery			1
more work needs to be done			0
' when a star runs out of fuel it usually collapses in on itself			2
stars more than eight times the mass of our sun will explode in a supernova , leaving behind a neutron star or black hole			2
smaller stars , though , will shed their outer layers and leave behind a hot dense core – known as a white dwarf			1
a white dwarf contains a similar amount of mass to its previous star but will be much smaller – about the size of @entity65 – making gravity at its surface much more intense			2
they are thought to be able to burn for tens or hundreds of billions of years - at which point they become black dwarfs – but as the universe is not this old , no black dwarfs exist in the universe yet			0
when they peered at the @entity77 , they found an emission of x-rays that corresponded to thousands of dead stars being present			1
the emission could also be due to millisecond pulsars - rapidly rotating neutron stars - or dense magnetic fields			0
' however , all these interpretations pose significant challenges to our understanding of stellar evolution , binary formation and cosmic - ray production in the @entity77 , ' the researchers wrote in their paper			0
the emissions were found to be coming from a region of the @entity77 13 by 26 light - years in size around the central supermassive black hole , called @entity98			0
on theory is that when stars die , they do n't always go quietly into the night			0
unlike stars like our sun , collapsed dead stars that belong to stellar pairs , or binaries , can siphon matter from their companions			0
this zombie - like ' feeding ' process differs depending on the nature of the normal star , but the result may be an eruption of x-rays			0
but it is the potential for these to be white dwarf stars that is the most intriguing theory			2
scientists at @entity31 in @entity32 say they have spotted x-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs ( one illustrated centre ) at the galaxy 's centre			1
these are stars left behind after larger ones use up their fuel			1
but why thousands of these stars are here remains a mystery there are already known to be many young , massive stars orbiting our galaxy 's central supermassive black hole - but why there would be thousands of white dwarf stars as well is not clear			1
white dwarfs are what are left when medium - mass stars - including our sun - shed their outer layers at the end of their life			1
behind is left the hot , dense core which burns white			2
if the white dwarf gathers too much material from a companion , its mass will reach a critical point and the star will explode			0
the researchers say the latest finding needs further study to get to the bottom of the mystery			2
' this new result just reminds us that the galactic center is a bizarre place , ' said co-author @entity160 of @entity41			0
' in the same way people behave differently walking on the street instead of jammed on a crowded rush hour subway , stellar objects exhibit weird behavior when crammed in close quarters near the supermassive black hole			0
' shown is the region around the supermassive black hole at the @entity2 's @entity77 - @entity98 - where the x-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs were found			1
other possible explanations include millisecond pulsars , which are rapidly rotating neutron stars @entity35 's @entity18 telescope ( illustrated ) is a space - based x-ray telescope that focuses high - energy x-rays from distant astrophysical sources			2
its primary goal is to conduct a survey for black holes , but it has also been used for other purposes such as this latest research			0

scientists at @entity31 in @entity32 made the finding
they spotted x-ray emissions consistent with thousands of white dwarfs
these are stars left behind after larger ones use up their fuel
but why thousands of these stars are there remains a mystery
