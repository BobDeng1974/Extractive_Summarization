by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 02:10 est , 25 april 2013 a householder who trapped a suspected burglar inside his home told of his fury yesterday after police let the man go			2
@entity7 , 53 , realised at 2.30am that there was a man inside the rear porch of his house and that he was trying to break down an inside door			1
he dashed out of the front door , ran round his house and locked the rear porch door , effectively trapping the intruder inside the porch space			2
@entity7 trapped a suspected burglar inside his home - only to be told by police they had later released him without charge angry : estate agent @entity7 has criticised police after a man he caught trying to barge into his home was released without charge but mr @entity7 , an estate agent , said that after he had handed him over to the police , officers seemed reluctant to arrest the man for attempted burglary and only did so when he insisted			1
he claimed they refused to take his statement about the attempted break - in because they were already late finishing their shift			0
when he spoke to police the next day , he discovered to his fury that they had released the intruder without charge			2
they had seemingly accepted the man ’s explanation that he had drunkenly mistaken mr @entity7 ’s house for his own home , and was trying to let himself in			1
mr @entity7 said he did not believe the explanation , and questioned why a drunk man would climb over a 4ft 6in gate and try to ‘ shoulder - barge ’ his way into his own home			1
‘ it does n’t look like the police asked many questions or made much of an effort to investigate the case , ’ he said			0
. dumfounded : mr @entity7 was woken by his labrador @entity52 , left , to find a man trying to barge into his home through the back door , right , but police decided not charge the suspect with any offence ‘ this was despite the fact i had caught the guy and detained him			1
i offered to give a statement and had done most of the officers ’ work			0
their excuses for not charging him are lame			0
‘ what is the point in trying to protect your home if the police do not back you ? ’ mr @entity7 said he was asleep with his girlfriend at his secluded , detached house in february when he heard his black labrador @entity52 barking to raise the alarm			1
he raced downstairs and locked the man inside the porch			0
mr @entity7 said it took police 25 minutes to reach his £ 850,000 home in @entity80 , near @entity81 , @entity82			1
and he questioned why officers had later accepted the intruder ’s explanation and released him			0
mr @entity7 said : ‘ first police told me the man had been drunk – but they did n’t charge him with being drunk and disorderly and he seemed sober to me			1
not happy : mr @entity7 said he can not understand why police did not charge the man when he done ' most of the work for them ' ‘ then they said he had mistakenly been trying to get into the wrong house – but i heard him tell them he lived about 15 miles away in @entity96			1
‘ i was furious when the police phoned me the following morning to say they were releasing him because he had not done anything wrong			0
‘ if the man was n’t drunk why did n’t they charge him with attempted burglary ? ’ mr @entity7 has made a formal complaint to @entity104 about their handling of the incident			1
a spokesman said : ‘ a man was arrested at the scene but later released without charge			2
‘ we are carrying out a full review of the incident			0
we will be working with mr @entity7 to resolve his dissatisfaction with the service he received			2
’ the spokesman added : ‘ it is absolutely untrue to suggest people are getting away with crime because we do n’t have sufficient resources to respond to incidents and crimes in progress			0
‘ we have officers available around the clock to respond to crimes			0
