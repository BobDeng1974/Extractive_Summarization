by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 08:11 est , 16 may 2013 the mother of a two - year - old girl , who was still in the womb when her policeman father died on a drunken night out , has started a legal battle on their daughter 's behalf to claim child maintenance from the @entity9			1
lawyers for toddler @entity11 say @entity13 's decision not to grant her a share of @entity16 's pension violates her human rights and discriminates against her as a child of unmarried parents			1
an inquest into the death of @entity22 , 31 , heard he had drunk at least seven pints of lager with a ' half cut ' group , including fellow officers , in june 2010 , when he died after falling down a flight of stairs in a central @entity31 pub. tragedy : @entity16 ( right ) died in 2010 while partner @entity33 ( left ) was pregnant with their daughter @entity34 , now two his partner @entity33 of @entity37 , @entity38 , was four and a half months pregnant at the time			1
mr @entity16 had been a police officer for six years and was stationed with the @entity9 's territorial support group			1
claim : some of football mad @entity16 's police pension should go towards supporting his child , his partner has claimed the couple 's then unborn daughter , @entity34 - who was delivered on november 10 , 2011 - made a claim to the @entity9 through her mother last year for entitlement to an allowance from her father 's pension			1
any ' natural child ' of a serving police officer is usually automatically entitled to support from his pension fund following his death , so long as he is still with the force when he dies			0
however the company that handles pension pay - outs for the @entity9 rejected @entity34 's claim last year , citing the highly unusual combination of her having not yet been born when her father died , as well as the fact that her parents were not married or in a civil partnership			1
through her mother , @entity34 has now launched a landmark legal battle to claim her ' inheritance '			2
her lawyers ' claim that the decision was unlawful raises important questions about the rights of unborn children and unmarried couples			1
coroner dr @entity77 , who recorded a verdict of accidental death in september 2010 , said of the accident at @entity81 , in @entity82 : ' mr @entity16 went out with friends and tragically fell			1
he suffered a significant injury on both sides of his brain			0
' the coroner heard that mr @entity16 had visited several bars on june 21 with friends and had drunk at least seven pints of lager before taking a taxi to central @entity31			2
having ordered another round of drinks , the group , who were described a ' half - cut ' , went up to the roof terrace where they could smoke			0
it was on the way back downstairs that mr @entity16 fell and hit his head ' extremely hard ' , according to witnesses			1
@entity103 , @entity34 's barrister , argues in a writ issued against the @entity105 at @entity31 's @entity106 that the refusal of support from her father 's pension is discriminatory and breaches her right to respect for family life			1
he argues that those parts of the @entity114 which are said to exclude @entity34 from financial support - because she was born out of wedlock after her father 's death - are ' incompatable ' with the @entity119			2
@entity106 : the legal battle is a key test case , as it could allow others to claim financial support for children not born until after their parent had died seeking a court declaration that @entity34 is entitled to a ' child survivors pension ' , the barrister states : ' such a pension is analogous to a right of inheritance			2
' he adds : ' the basis for such a refusal was an assertion ( that ) , for child allowance to be payable , the child must have been born before the police officer ceased serving as an officer or passed away '			0
mr @entity103 says that , under the regulations , a surviving natural child of a police officer , born before his death , is entitled to financial support , but that ' a child born after he dies is excluded from such an entitlement unless the officer was married to or in a civil partnership with the child 's mother			2
' the effect of ( the regulations ) is to discriminate against an illegitmate child born after the death of a serving police officer , compared with a legitimate child born in the same circumstances			0
there is no rational or legitimate justification for such discrimination , ' he claims			0
' discrimination on grounds of birth , including illegitimacy , in relation to any convention right is prohibited by article 14 of the convention , ' the barrister states			0
the @entity105 's defence to the action was not available from the court , and the claims in the writ have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge			0
however mr @entity103 says that the case is ' unlikely to involve a substantial dispute of fact '			0
mr @entity16 was a @entity180 fan who played for two football teams , @entity181 and @entity182			0
he was also a dog - lover and had three lurchers .			0

@entity11 was in her mother 's womb when *pc* @entity16 died
two - year - old 's father fell down some stairs on night out in 2010
mother @entity33 says their daughter must be paid some of his pension
not doing so breaches toddler 's human rights and discriminates against her because her parents were unmarried , lawyers claim
