@entity0 ? @entity1 was voted greatest @entity2 but are people misguided ? she is regarded as our greatest black @entity4 , a woman who did more to advance the cause of nursing - and race relations - than almost any other individual			1
on the @entity11 's bloody battlefields , she is said to have saved the lives of countless wounded soldiers and nursed them to health in a clinic paid for out of her own pocket			0
her name was @entity1 , and today she is almost as famous as that other nursing heroine , @entity20			1
for decades after her death in 1881 , @entity1 's story was largely overlooked , but for the past 15 years her reputation and exploits have undergone a remarkable rehabilitation			1
schoolchildren are taught about her achievements and for many , @entity1 , born in @entity28 in 1805 to a white @entity30 officer called @entity31 and a @entity33 woman from whom @entity1 learned her ' nursing skills ' , is seen as a secular saint			1
numerous schools , hospitals and universities have rooms or buildings named after her , and shortly she will get her greatest tribute yet : an 8ft tall bronze statue is to be erected to her memory in the grounds of @entity47 , facing towards the @entity48			0
the Â£ 500,000 memorial - larger than the statue of @entity20 near @entity53 - will show @entity1 marching out to the battlefield , a medical bag over her shoulder , a row of medals proudly pinned to her chest			1
there 's just one problem : historians around the world are growing increasingly uneasy about the statue , amid claims the adulation of @entity1 has gone too far			1
they claim her achievements have been hugely oversold for political reasons , and out of a commendable - but in this case misguided - desire to create positive black role models			1
now @entity1 is at the centre of a new controversy with the news that the story of her life will no longer be taught to thousands of pupils			1
forgotten angel of the @entity11 : for decades after her death , @entity1 's story was largely overlooked @entity48 education secretary @entity77 has decreed that instead they will learn about traditional figures such as @entity80 and @entity81			1
so is it unfair to reduce her standing in this way ? not according to several historians			0
' the hype that has built up surrounding this otherwise worthy woman is a disgrace to the serious study of history , ' declares @entity91 of the @entity92			0
his views are shared by @entity94 , a fellow of the @entity95 who recently wrote a paper for an academic journal stating that @entity1 is the ' subject of many myths ' , arguing that numerous ' facts ' concerning her life are simply untrue			1
indeed , @entity102 singles out the teaching of some of the stories about @entity1 as ' irresponsible ' and ' certainly not history '			1
meanwhile , leading the charge against the statue being placed at @entity109 's is @entity110 , a history professor and world expert on @entity20 , who feels @entity1 is being promoted at the expense of @entity20			1
contemporary accounts : @entity1 depicted in @entity114 on may 30 , 1857 ' @entity20 was the pioneer nurse , not @entity1 , ' says @entity110			1
' it 's fine to have a statue to whoever you want , but @entity1 was not a pioneer nurse , she did n't call herself a nurse , she did n't practise nursing , and she had no association with @entity109 's or any other hospital			1
' ' @entity1 was not a pioneer nurse , she did n't call herself a nurse , she did n't practise nursing ' so are these protests justified ? was the real @entity1 the heroine she has been made out to be ? textbooks used for the current @entity130 say that in her twenties , @entity1 married a @entity28 merchant called @entity133 and they travelled around the @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 until his death in 1844			1
@entity1 then set up a ' hotel ' in the town of @entity140 in @entity141 , where she is reputed to have treated cholera victims			1
with the outbreak of the @entity144 later that year , @entity1 was determined to offer her nursing services to the @entity146 and , when she was turned down , paid her way to the peninsula out of her own pocket			1
celebrated : a lost painting of @entity1 from 1869 went on display at @entity152 in 2011 once she had arrived in the @entity11 , @entity1 tried to work for @entity20 , who supposedly turned her away			1
instead , she established her ' @entity154 ' - part boarding house , part medical centre - from where she sold alcohol , hearty food and ran a daily clinic , as well as tending to the sick on the battlefield , even under bombardment			0
for all this , she was awarded the @entity163			1
after the war ended , @entity1 returned to @entity146 , so impoverished she had to declare bankruptcy			2
however , such was her reputation a benefit fund was established for her , which received the blessing of @entity170 @entity169			0
by the time she died in 1881 , @entity1 had retreated into obscurity and not until recently was she ' rediscovered ' as a heroine of @entity11			2
that is the version of events taught to schoolchildren in recent years			0
unfortunately , many key details are either untrue or stretch credulity to breaking point			0
part of the problem is that much of the historical record concerning @entity1 comes from her autobiography , which contains downright inventions , including meetings with people whom she could never have encountered			2
other key details have been embellished or invented by contemporary accounts			0
and although @entity1 is championed as a black heroine - voted greatest @entity2 of all time in a 2004 poll - she was actually three - quarters white			2
heritage : a blue plaque was unveiled in 2007 by culture secretary @entity192 and professor @entity193 , from the @entity194 , marking the nurses home at 14 @entity196 in @entity197 her mother was mixed race and her father white			0
in her book , @entity1 claims her skin is more ' yellow ' than black , and she displayed more pride in her white @entity30 ancestry than her black @entity28 heritage			1
' anyone who employs mrs @entity1 , ' @entity20 wrote , ' will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness and improper conduct , wherever she is ' furthermore , although one observer noted that she was ' a few shades darker than the white lily ' , her skin colour seems to have attracted remarkably little attention from those she helped in the @entity11			2
however , today , @entity1 's skin colour is seen as being vitally important - and stated as the reason the @entity218 rejected her offers of assistance			2
@entity1 did wonder whether she was a victim of racism : ' did these ladies shrink from accepting my aid because my blood flowed beneath a somewhat duskier skin than theirs ? ' she asked			2
but although race could have been a factor , @entity1 was more likely to have been rejected because of her age - she was 50 when she volunteered - and the type of home - made medicine she practised , which was regarded as quackery by the medical establishment			2
@entity1 herself admitted that when she treated the sick in @entity141 she made ' lamentable blunders ' so she ' lost patients which a little later i could have saved '			2
she even administered highly toxic lead acetate as an attempted treatment for cholera			0
thin @entity244 : @entity146 troops at the @entity246 on october 25 , 1854 , during the @entity144 and she knew her lack of qualifications made the @entity250 wary			0
' i am not for a single instant going to blame the authorities who would not listen to the offer of a motherly yellow woman , ' she wrote			0
another myth beloved of the politically correct telling of @entity1 's story is that her offers of help were personally rejected by @entity20			2
once again , this is untrue			0
in her autobiography , @entity1 says she was not interested in working at @entity20 's hospital at @entity265 and instead only asked the celebrated ' @entity266 ' for a bed for the night , which was duly granted			2
throughout her life , @entity1 spoke warmly of @entity20 , although the feeling was not mutual			2
@entity20 regarded @entity1 's @entity154 ' as something approaching a ' bad house '' , and believed that although she was ' kind to the men			2
and did some good ' , she ' made many drunk '			0
' anyone who employs mrs @entity1 , ' @entity20 wrote , ' will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness and improper conduct , wherever she is			0
' yet if the haughty @entity20 cared little for her , there is no doubt @entity1 was a favourite among the men			0
despite its high prices , her ' hotel ' ( more a glorified hut ) was a popular place to eat , drink			0
icon : an 8ft statue of @entity1 is to be built at @entity47 in @entity197 heroine : @entity20 is @entity146 's most famous nurse from the bloody @entity11 conflict ' all the men swore by her , ' wrote one , ' and in case of any malady would seek her advice and use her herbal medicines , in preference to reporting to their own doctors			1
' but the idea that she ran a clinic or some sort of hospital is a gross exaggeration			0
' the story of @entity1 has been spun out of all proportion , her memory hijacked and her achievements embellished in order to provide a role model ' there was no accommodation at the ' hotel ' , and although she may have dispensed herbal home - made medicines to alleviate symptoms of ailments such as diarrhoea , the idea that a single woman working alone and away from a hospital could have done anything to combat an illness as deadly as cholera is far - fetched in the extreme			1
in truth , @entity1 was more of a mother figure to the officers and men			0
she was well - liked and she undoubtedly did at some point go onto a battlefield dispensing comforts such as wine and doing her best to deal with the odd injury			0
it was her popularity that led to a benefit fund being set up for her when she returned bankrupted to @entity146 - much to the chagrin of @entity20 , who felt queen @entity340 had been misled into supporting the campaign			0
' a shameful ignorant imposture was practised on the @entity170 , ' she wrote privately			0
and contrary to many historical accounts , @entity1 was never awarded a @entity163 for her efforts			1
although she often wore the medal , her name does not appear on any of the official rolls			0
although some would say she was morally deserving of recognition â - and indeed a statue - for her warm heart and personal courage , the story of @entity1 has been spun out of all proportion , her memory hijacked and her achievements embellished in order to provide a role model			1
it may be good politics , but it is poor history .			0

claims of her achievements have been hugely oversold for political reasons , says leading historian
' @entity1 was not a pioneer nurse , she did n't call herself a nurse '
contrary to accounts , @entity1 was never awarded a @entity163
