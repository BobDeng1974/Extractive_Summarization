researchers claim the resemblance between ‘ amphitheatre ’ canyons in this region and those on @entity7 reveal important clues about the red planet ’s watery past			1
u-shaped amphitheatre canyons , such as those in @entity5 ’s @entity19 , are relatively rare on @entity20 but common on the @entity7 surface			1
a massive flood that carved canyons , such as @entity24 in @entity5 ( pictured ) , 46,000 years ago could explain similar gorges on @entity7 a number of explanations for how these canyons formed have been offered with the most common being a slow and steady process of erosion from upwelling springs			1
writing in the @entity32 , @entity34 professor , @entity35 , argues the canyons were created by an enormous flood rather than gradual erosion			2
he has calculated that the brief flood was at least nine metres ( 30 feet ) deep , flowing at a rate of around 1.25 million litres per second			2
two canyons in @entity19 , @entity43 and @entity44 , are characterised by tall vertical headwalls , roughly 150 feet high that curve around to form an amphitheatre u-shaped canyons , such as those in @entity5 's @entity19 , are relatively rare on @entity20 but common on the @entity50 ( pictured ) the latest study builds on a body of research that has provided a clearer image of @entity7 ' watery history			1
evidence of water on @entity7 dates back to the @entity59 mission , which arrived on @entity7 in 1971			2
@entity59 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs			0
@entity68 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on @entity7 by showing how floods of water broke through dams , carved deep valleys , eroded grooves into bedrock , and traveled thousands of kilometers			1
@entity7 is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time			0
however , the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past			0
in june this year , curiosity rover found @entity86 evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity7			0
two canyons in @entity19 , @entity43 and @entity44 , are characterised by tall vertical headwalls , roughly 150 feet high that curve around to form an amphitheatre			2
to understand how they formed , the researchers conducted field surveys and collected rock samples from @entity43 , @entity44 , and a third canyon in @entity19 , known as @entity96			0
‘ these blocks are too big to move by spring flow , and there 's not enough time for the groundwater to have dissolved them away , ’ professor @entity97 said ‘ which means that large floods are needed to move them out			0
‘ to make a canyon , you have to erode the canyon headwall , and you also have to evacuate the material that collapses in			0
' surprisingly , the researchers discovered the amphitheatre - headed canyons of @entity19 formed at the same time as the amphitheatre - headed @entity24 , about 18 km ( 11 miles ) to the south 46,000 years ago			1
a brief , powerful flood could have created these amphitheatre - headed canyons by exploiting fractures in the rock causing rapid erosion			0
these insights into ancient megafloods on @entity20 could reveal clues about what may have occurred on the surface of @entity7 millions of years ago the amphitheatre - headed canyons originated around the same time as the volcanic eruption that led to the creation of the nearby @entity129			1
this suggests the megaflood that carved them was caused by lava flows diverting an ancient river			0
these insights into ancient megafloods on @entity20 could reveal clues about what may have occurred on the surface of @entity7 millions of years ago			1
the researchers are now developing models simulating canyon formation by megafloods			0
‘ we intend to test the model against our data at @entity19 and to apply it to specific examples on @entity7 , ’ professor @entity97 told @entity139			2
‘ using @entity20 as our guide , the early history of @entity7 surface environments , including the amounts and duration of flowing surface water , is waiting to be discovered through careful analysis of the landforms and sedimentary deposits on the red planet			1

*scientists* *predict* a flood 9 metres deep occurred in @entity5 46,000 years ago
they believe this carved ' *ampitheatre* ' canyons in @entity19
*similarities* between canyons in this region and those on @entity7 suggest the same process occurred on the red planet millions of years ago
