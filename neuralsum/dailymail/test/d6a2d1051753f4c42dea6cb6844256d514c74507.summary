he was , as one @entity2 board member put it , just too accident - prone for a role that has seen him flounder in the face of the bitter fallout from an @entity9 whitewash			2
@entity10 was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as @entity2 ’s managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder			1
it was @entity10 who made the big call to sack @entity20 and reappoint @entity21 as @entity2 coach			1
@entity10 has left his role as managing director of @entity2 the move came a day ahead of an @entity2 board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of @entity28 october 2013 @entity10 , a former @entity2 wicketkeeper , is appointed managing sirector of @entity2 , with his position taking effect from february 1 , 2014			1
february 2014 after the @entity9 whitewash , @entity20 and head coach @entity32 are sacked			0
after days of silence , the official line on @entity20 ’s dismissal is that the @entity2 wanted to ‘ create a culture ’ in which captain @entity38 had ‘ the full support of all players ’			0
march 2014 @entity2 suffer a humiliating 45 - run defeat to @entity42 in the @entity43			2
@entity44 top - scored for @entity2 with just 18			2
@entity45 @entity10 appoints @entity21 , who had spent the previous four seasons as head coach at @entity48 , for a second spell as @entity2 head coach			1
may 2014 @entity10 and the @entity2 issue an apology to @entity20 for claiming he appeared ‘ disinterested ’ and ‘ distracted ’ during the fifth @entity53 in @entity54			1
june 2014 @entity2 lose a test series at home to @entity57			0
the south @entity59 side had previously won on @entity61 soil in 1998 — in a one - off test match			2
july - aug 2014 @entity2 lose the second test against @entity64 , but come back to win the home series 3 - 1			2
in the fifth test , @entity2 inflict upon @entity64 their third heaviest defeat in history			0
december 2014 @entity38 is sacked as one - day captain and replaced by @entity70 , marking the end of a sorry year for @entity2 in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats			1
february - march 2015 @entity2 endure a dreadful @entity75 campaign , failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind @entity77 , who sealed their exit with a 15 - run victory			1
april 2015 @entity10 departs as @entity2 managing director			1
the @entity2 are to create a new role of ‘ director of @entity84 ’ ahead of the @entity9 series			2
he also had to back the decision to replace @entity38 as one - day captain on the brink of the @entity75 even though it was the selectors who drove it			1
but , most of all , it is @entity2 ’s humiliating @entity75 that led the 14 members of the @entity2 management board to unanimously back the sacking of @entity28 when new chief executive @entity95 rang them on wednesday morning			1
so acute was the embarrassment at @entity2 going out in the first round of the @entity75 that any hopes @entity10 had for an extended stay in office proved impossible			1
to the new regime he had to go			0
‘ @entity104 ( his predecessor ) stayed in the background but @entity10 became far too high - profile , ’ one board member told @entity103 on wednesday night			1
‘ he was always on the outfield before games			0
the bottom line is that he was just too accident prone			0
’ @entity10 is the most high - profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through @entity61 cricket , led by @entity95 and chairman - elect @entity114 but he will not be the last , unless @entity2 are successful in their busiest of all years			1
@entity115 , the national selector , is the most vulnerable , not least because a change of job description for @entity10 ’s successor to director of @entity2 cricket looks likely to make the new man an all - round supremo			1
@entity21 and captain @entity38 now need to beat the @entity123 in the three - @entity53 series starting in @entity125 on monday if they are to feel secure			2
they must then carry on winning when they face @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 over the next 10 months in test cricket alone			0
whether this makes a difference to @entity20 ’s future remains to be seen			0
clearly the removal of the man who sacked him and an @entity2 chairman @entity139 who was firmly against @entity20 must increase the odds on one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport history happening this summer			0
much may depend on who replaces @entity10 because there is still no real appetite within the @entity2 , and certainly not among senior members of the @entity2 team , for @entity20 to return			1
his best chance may be if @entity150 is appointed by a man he is known to be close to in @entity114			0
the former @entity2 captain said on wednesday that he would like to talk to the @entity2 about the role			2
@entity150 was the @entity2 captain who brought the best from @entity20 , admittedly when he was young and far less likely to cause trouble , and has made no secret of his encouragement for his return			0
yet @entity150 , a constant critic of @entity28 and @entity21 , has a myriad of interests , both cricketing and otherwise , that he presumably must shelve if he is to return to the @entity2 now			0
a more likely scenario is for another former @entity2 captain in @entity163 to take up a role that would appear made for him			0
there were many at the @entity2 who wanted @entity163 to succeed @entity104 , not least the @entity168 himself , but he ruled it out at the time , saying it was too soon after the end of his playing career			0
since then he has dabbled in commentary with @entity175 but may now think the time is right for what seems a natural progression to administration			0
@entity10 's job description has been abolished as a result following @entity2 's dismal @entity75 showing @entity10 leaves his role as @entity2 managing director following @entity2 's shameful performance at @entity75 former @entity2 captain @entity150 said on wednesday he would like to talk to the @entity2 about the role @entity20 ( left ) could return for @entity2 while @entity163 ( right ) is another that could take the role @entity20 was uncharacteristically coy when asked on @entity189 for his thoughts on @entity10 ’s departure @entity192 is another candidate who , presumably , would have a more open mind about recalling @entity20 as he has just re-signed him for @entity194			1
he is the third man on the most likely three - man short - list			2
the best brains in @entity61 cricket are undoubtedly @entity198 and @entity199 so @entity95 and @entity114 should be doing all they possibly can to encourage one of them to return to the national cause			0
@entity198 has already refused and it is extremely unlikely @entity199 would be tempted either			0
@entity10 has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team			1
he was a respected wicketkeeper - batsman with @entity2 who had to play much of his @entity210 against the @entity123 at their peak and was widely admired for his bravery and gutsy character			2
his return to cricket after a career in the @entity217 came at a time when @entity104 assured him that everything was in place for a bright future			0
@entity2 ’s catastrophic collapse in @entity129 changed everything			0
the decision to ditch @entity20 was , as far as i am concerned , absolutely right while @entity21 may yet prove to be the coach @entity10 and others believe him to be			1
but a fall - guy was needed for the @entity75 and @entity10 was the obvious candidate			1
it remains to be seen how many follow			0
@entity28 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) pose following a press conference at @entity232 @entity21 ( from left to right ) , @entity28 and @entity2 captain @entity38 during the press conference @entity10 speaks with sir @entity234 at @entity232 on may 31 , 2014 meanwhile , here in @entity237 , @entity235 picked a bad day to remind @entity2 that he is a player of real potential despite being jettisoned after the winter ’s @entity9 disaster			1
@entity2 ’s decision to turn their second warm - up game into a practice session saw @entity235 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity248 bat for an extremely weak @entity249 against their own team			2
@entity245 fell third ball to @entity252 , fending a ball outside off stump to third slip , while @entity246 still looked out of touch in being dismissed for 17			0
yet @entity235 , the back - up keeper on this tour , made the most of his chance to score 98 before falling to the impressive @entity261			2
there was an early worry when @entity264 slipped in his delivery stride and fell clutching his ankle			0
he went off for treatment but later returned to bowl and looked no worse for the accident			0
@entity248 was also struck flush on the helmet fielding at short leg but came out later to bat for @entity273			0
@entity2 will bat for the whole of thursday before leaving for monday ’s first test in @entity125			0
@entity38 @entity10 was a supporter of @entity38 as @entity53 captain but was persuaded to sack him as one - day captain three weeks before the disastrous @entity75 campaign			1
the new ‘ director of @entity2 cricket ’ might think @entity38 needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician verdict : vulnerable @entity38 was suppoerted by @entity10 before being sacked as one - day captain before the @entity75 @entity115 the chairman of selectors and former @entity290 captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in @entity61 cricket			1
selections have been difficult to fathom at times and a series of well - publicised clangers have alienated the selector from players , spectators and media verdict : sure to follow @entity10 out the door @entity2 selector @entity115 ( left ) and former managing director @entity10 during a nets session @entity21 an atrocious @entity75 heaped even more pressure on the coach , whose reappointment last year by @entity10 has been mitigated only by last summer ’s @entity308 win against @entity64			1
described as ‘ the outstanding coach of his generation ’ by @entity10 , @entity21 ’ position is now as weak as it has been			1
verdict : vulnerable @entity21 ’ position is now as weak as it has been following @entity10 's dismissal at the @entity2 @entity20 it is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport , this high - maintenance player could be on the brink of a return			1
but @entity10 ’s removal , and @entity139 ’s departure , means the path is now clear for @entity20 if he scores runs for @entity194			1
verdict : return possible @entity20 's path is now clear to return if he scores runs for @entity194 and he tweeted just as much			2

@entity10 was swept aside as managing director on wednesday
@entity10 lost his job following a *woeful* 2015 @entity75 performance
the *58* - year - old 's job description has been abolished as a result
