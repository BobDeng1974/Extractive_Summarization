by @entity1 reporter the @entity2 has denied claims there is a ' celebrity witch hunt ' , after @entity7 actor @entity6 was cleared of abuse charges			1
@entity9 , chief crown prosecutor for @entity10 - who announced the charges against both mr @entity6 and his fellow street star @entity13 - told a child sexual exploitation conference that each case was assessed on its own merits			1
mr @entity13 's aunt and several former @entity7 colleagues claimed he had been taken to court just because of his celebrity status			1
@entity9 , chief crown prosecutor for @entity10 , announced the charges against both @entity6 and fellow street star @entity13			1
he denied claims of a celebrity witch hunt the actor had earlier been cleared by a jury at @entity26 last september of a string of allegations made by his accuser , who claimed she had been raped and abused when she was a young girl			1
mr @entity9 said that they had a ' duty ' to consider the evidence in all such serious cases			1
he added : ' when serious allegations are made and the evidence in a case passes the prosecution test it is right that a jury considers the evidence			2
' that is the way our legal system works , the prosecution decides that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction whereas the jury must decide the case is proved beyond all reasonable doubt			2
' when a jury delivers a verdict , no matter what it is , that is justice being done			0
@entity13 's aunt and several former @entity7 colleagues claimed he had been taken to court just because of his celebrity status ' we have a duty to those who make complaints of serious offences to listen to the allegations , and assess the evidence against the same evidential standards we use for all criminal cases , no matter who makes the complaint , or who the complaint is against			1
' this case was treated like any other - what mattered were the allegations and the evidence and nothing else , and we fully respect the decisions of the jury and thank them for their careful deliberation			2
' mr @entity9 , who is also the national lead on child sexual exploitation for the @entity2 , said : ' i absolutely detest this word ' witch hunt '			1
' it is not a witch hunt			1
we look at the evidence			0
' he said it was then a matter for the courts and juries to decide on what was put before them			0
' i am not shy about pursuing these type of cases and will continue to do so , ' he said			0
' the vast majority of child sex abusers are not your public figures ... and they can not be allowed to get away with it because of some discourse about " this is some kind of campaign ' that is following what happened with ( @entity113 ) @entity112 or @entity114 or whoever it may be			2
' he said he had been spoken of as a ' celeb hunter '			0
' i do n't even know what a " celeb hunter " is , ' he said			0
' nobody should be above the law in this country			0
' he said it ' does not matter ' if , when looking at evidence , ' it takes us to someone who might have drawn attention to themselves publicly in some way , shape or form '			0
mr @entity9 said : ' our resolve has to be ' is the evidence there ? can we make this evidence stronger ? ' ' if we can make it stronger , is it sufficient to have a realistic prospect of conviction ? ' invariably if it is child sexual abuse it will be in the public interest to prosecute it			1
' it is then the @entity2 's aim to present a ' robust prosecution ' and ensure a suspect 's account is tested before a jury , he said			2
the then director of public prosecutions , @entity153 , later told a @entity154 that it was the ' right decision ' to pursue a prosecution of mr @entity13			1
mr @entity9 , who is also the national lead on child sexual exploitation for the @entity2 , said : ' i absolutely detest this word ' witch hunt ' mr @entity6 , who plays the character of @entity163 in the soap opera @entity7 , leaves with sons @entity166 ( left ) , @entity167 ( second left ) and daughter @entity168 ( right ) after being cleared of all charges at @entity171 mr @entity153 said : ' a proper assessment was taken in the case and the decision to proceed was the right decision			1
' there is a safeguard within our system and that is at the end of the prosecution 's case in court , it is not only open to the judge it is the duty of the judge to stop the case if there 's no case to answer			2
' that did not happen in this case , and therefore there was a case to answer			0
' that case was answered and the jury took some time to consider their verdict			0
' so it was a properly brought case , it 's not a case on which there was no evidence , had it been it would have been stopped half way after testing of the evidence			0
' he went on : ' it is true , the test for the prosecutor is a realistic prospect of conviction and the test for the jury is whether the case is proved beyond all reasonable doubt having heard all the witnesses			0
' but the fact that a decision was taken to start a case and it does n't end up in conviction does not mean it was improperly brought			0
