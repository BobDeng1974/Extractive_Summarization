@entity1 sen. @entity0 now says he would be ' open ' to blocking a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who entered the country improperly			1
while he continues to favor legislation that would create opportunities for illegal immigrants to become @entity10 citizens , @entity0 told the @entity11 that he would be willing to entertain legislation that allows for permanent residency but not citizenship in order to get conservatives on board with changes to the current system			1
' we might prohibit people who came here illegally and got green cards under this process from ever becoming citizens			0
and if that ’s what we have to do to get this thing passed , i would be open to it , ' he told the @entity11 during an interview published on wednesday			2
' but i do n’t think that ’s a wise thing to do , ' he added			1
while he continues to favor legislation that would create opportunities for illegal immigrants to become @entity10 citizens , @entity0 says that he would be willing to entertain legislation that allows for permanent residency but not citizenship for immigrants in order to get conservatives on board with changes to the current system as a freshman senator @entity0 , the son of @entity42 immigrants , embraced the issue of immigration and joined onto efforts to pass comprehensive reforms led by a bipartisan group of senators known as the @entity49 that included @entity51 sens. @entity50 of @entity52 and @entity53 and @entity54 of @entity55			1
the bill passed in the @entity58 - controlled @entity57 in mid 2013 but never made it the floor of the @entity61 before the end of the 113th session of @entity64			0
confronted with the political reality that comprehensive reform wo n't pass the @entity51 - run @entity61 , @entity0 has since withdrawn his support for a comprehensive bill and has latched on to the piecemeal approach touted by @entity61 speaker @entity71			1
' an " @entity75 " strategy on immigration reform would result in nothing , ' @entity0 's spokesman , @entity72 , told @entity77 last year			1
' what is keeping us from progress on a series of immigration issues on which there is strong consensus is the fear that a conference committee on a limited bill will be used to negotiate a comprehensive one			0
we should take that option off the table so that we can begin to move on the things we agree on , ' he said			0
at a gathering of conservative activists in august , @entity0 made a similar point after he was heckled by immigration advocates who accused him of wanting to deport them			2
' i ’ve been there , i tried it , it does n’t work			0
you are not going to have the support in @entity64 for the sort of comprehensive approach they ’re insisting upon , ' he told a reporter for @entity106			0
' and i think the approach they ’ve taken , that they have some sort of right , is the wrong approach			0
i actually think it sets back the cause , ' he said			0
@entity72 confirmed to @entity114 today that the senator ' stands by ' the principles in the @entity49 bill and believes that immigration reform legislation should include language that allows ' qualifying illegal immigrants ' to obtain green cards and eventually become @entity10 citizens			1
@entity0 would , however , be more strict with the qualifications for permanent residency , @entity72 explained , stressing that the @entity57 's immigration bill was compromise legislation			1
and ' if it 's impossible to pass that sort of reform , he would be open to reform that allowed for permanent residence but not citizenship for illegal immigrants , ' @entity72 said			1
illegal immigrants with serious criminal histories and those who arrived in the last several years would not qualify under the law and would be subject to immediate removal			1
protesters shout at @entity0 as supporters try to usher them away during during a bbq hosted by rep. @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity52 , in august			2
the immigration advocates accused him of wanting to deport them @entity0 is pictured here with other members of the @entity57 's ' @entity146 ' during an april 18 , 2013 press conference to introduce their comprehensive immigration bill			2
pictured alongside @entity0 are , from left to right , @entity55 @entity51 @entity54 , @entity150 democrat @entity149 , @entity55 @entity51 @entity53 , @entity152 democrat @entity151 and @entity154 democrat @entity153 while @entity0 would like to see @entity64 take on immigration on the next legislative session , the possible presidential candidate poured cold water on the notion that the @entity51 must pass immigration reforms before 2016 in order to remain political viable in that year 's elections			1
' those who argue that this will be a bonanza for @entity51 are not telling the truth , ' the @entity1 senator told the @entity11			0
' those who argue that we should do it for the purpose of politics are also misanalyzing the issue ' @entity0 's comments were an direct jab shot across the bow at pundits and lawmakers , like fellow @entity49 member @entity50 , who have argued that in order to woo the growing @entity181 - @entity10 population , the @entity51 must embrace immigration reform			1
' if we do n't at least make a down payment on solving the problem and rationally dealing ' with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants residing in the country , ' if we become the party of self - deportation in 2015 and 2016 , then the chance of winning the @entity191 i think is almost nonexistent , ' @entity50 said on @entity193 's @entity192 last sunday			1
@entity50 lauded former @entity1 gov. @entity195 's foray into the 2016 presidential race , calling him an ' excellent candidate ' who has ' rational , logical views on immigration			0
' ' this primary is wide open , ' though , he said			0
@entity0 told the @entity11 that he was still ' weighing ' his own presidential campaign and repeated previous claims that friend and fellow @entity1 @entity195 's entry into the race would have no effect on his decision			2
' if i do n’t run , it wo n’t be because @entity195 is running , ' he said			0
' maybe if you ’re going to run for county commissioner or to be on the @entity212 or something like that , you may not want to run against a friend of yours , ' he said			0
' we certainly know a lot of the same people ; we also know some different people			0
i do n’t believe if i decide to run for president that that will be an impediment , ' @entity0 said in a separate @entity224 interview that also came out today			2
as far as an announcement is concerned , @entity0 told @entity224 that he is ' closer to a decision than we were a month ago ' but gave no indication of which way he is leaning .			2

' but i do n’t think that ’s a wise thing to do , ' he added
@entity0 continues to favor legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants
but he now says he would be willing to entertain legislation that allows for permanent residency but not citizenship in order to get conservatives on board with immigration reform
