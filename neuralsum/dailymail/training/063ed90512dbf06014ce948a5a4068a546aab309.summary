by @entity0 people decide how trustworthy strangers are within the blink of an eye , psychologists have found , and it is all down to the shape of their face			1
we tend to judge someone with high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones to be more honest , while we are less likely to trust someone with a furrowed brow and sunken cheeks , researchers suggest			2
the findings give new weight to the principle that first impressions count			0
psychologists from @entity36 found that a section of the brain decides a person ’s trustworthiness even before we have consciously perceived who they are			1
the brain takes just 33 milliseconds - three hundredths of a second , or a tenth of a time it takes to blink - to decide whether someone is to be trusted			1
the study , published last night in the @entity50 , suggests that our brains are set up to be instantly wary of people we decided we should not trust			2
@entity53 , assistant professor at @entity36 ’s @entity54 , said : ‘ our findings suggest that the brain automatically responds to a face ’s trustworthiness before it is even consciously perceived			1
‘ the results are consistent with an extensive body of research suggesting that we form spontaneous judgments of other people that can be largely outside awareness			2
’ applying the findings to public figures , the @entity65 found that trusted individuals such as newsreader @entity26 and archbishop of canterbury @entity69 indeed have high cheekbones and eyebrows			1

the @entity90 research team presented a panel of ten volunteers with 300 computer generated faces , and asked them how trustworthy each was			1
those faces with high cheekbones , high eyebrows and a smile were perceived to be the most honest			0
the scientists also presented the panel with real pictures of strangers , and the same facial attributes were found to be deemed as trustworthy			0
in a second set of experiments , a new set of 37 volunteers were presented with the ‘ trustworthy ’ and ‘ untrustworthy ’ images for a split second , while their brain activity was monitored			0
the images were then immediately replaced with a neutral picture so the brain could no longer process the previous image			0
the scientists found that a region of the brain called the amygdala , which is vital in social and emotional behaviour , activated within 33 milliseconds even when the images were flashed up just momentarily			1
actress and human rights activist @entity118 ( left ) has high cheekbones , as does @entity121 ( right ) faces with the high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones prompted activity in a different part of the amygdala than faces with furrowed brows and sunken cheeks			0
dr @entity53 said : ‘ the findings suggest that we can assess another person ’s trustworthiness from their face extremely rapidly and without conscious awareness , and that the amygdala plays an important role in this process			0
‘ one possibility is that faces that appear more untrustworthy and likely to inflict harm , or faces with stronger trustworthiness cues in general , are spontaneously tracked by the amygdala , so the amygdala could then quickly alter other brain processes and coordinate fast , appropriate responses to people --- approach or avoid			1
‘ this tracking would be especially pronounced for untrustworthy faces , who might inflict harm , which is consistent with what we found			0
’ dr @entity156 , a @entity76 cosmetic surgeon who specialises in hair transplants , including eyebrows , said : ‘ the study ’s findings are fascinating and further emphasises that we do make first assumptions which are not necessarily based on our experiences or what information we have been exposed to			0

@entity90 psychologists found people judge trustworthiness on features
