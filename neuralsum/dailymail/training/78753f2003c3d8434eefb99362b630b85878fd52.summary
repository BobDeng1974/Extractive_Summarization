@entity1 's £ 32million transfer fee to @entity2 squeezes him between @entity4 's @entity3 , at £ 31m , and former @entity7 full - back @entity5 , who moved there for £ 36.5m , in the most expensive ever defenders list			1
on current form for his new club , he would be more suitably positioned between a pair of unknown @entity14 defenders			1
' where did they sign him from ? ' one spectator at the @entity18 asked			1
it was pointed out he came from @entity20			1
' i hope they kept the receipt			2
' @entity24 was poor against @entity25 on saturday and has not impressed in his seven games for @entity2 the @entity28 back ( right ) is beaten to the ball by @entity25 striker @entity30 ( left ) @entity24 ( left ) is challenged in the air by @entity25 's on - loan defender @entity32 ( centre ) @entity1 struggled to deal with the likes of @entity30 ( left ) and had an especially torrid time against @entity36 the defender moved to @entity2 for £ 32million in august , signing a five - year - deal with the @entity38 @entity24 ( left ) appeals before @entity36 's match - winning header was deemed to have crossed the line what city manager @entity42 saw in the player when he signed him in the summer is a mystery , at the moment			1
9 min - almost scuffs a clearance over @entity2 goalkeeper @entity48 18 min - easily beaten to a long - ball by @entity25 striker @entity36 , which lead to a chance for the home side 19 min - @entity36 steals the ball from the @entity2 defender near his own box on the right 41 min - leaves @entity56 unmarked in the @entity2 , but misses to the left 42 min - fails to clear the ball and loses posession to @entity36 yet again he was a constant liability at the back for @entity2 against @entity25			1
this is not the first nightmare afternoon he has had , in only seven games			2
against @entity67 , last month , he conceded a penalty and scored an own goal			1
fortunately on that day his team - mates managed to score four so he got away with it			2
that was not the case this time			2
from as early as the ninth minute it started going wrong , when he was facing his own goal and thrashed a leg at the ball sending the clearance looping over @entity48 and heading in , only for the goalkeeper to push it over			1
ten minutes later and @entity48 saved him again			2
@entity36 all too easily beat @entity24 to a long - range free kick sent into the box and his cushion header played in @entity56 , who was only denied by @entity48 from point - blank range			0
the same happened again in the second half – another ball booted high and long which the centre - back took time to position himself under and jump for the header , only for @entity36 to beat him again			0
nothing came from it on this occasion			0
on 19 minutes he was at fault again			0
this time @entity24 had his pocket picked by @entity36 near his own box on the right			0
@entity100 eventually rushed back to clear , while tumbling , when the ball was crossed into the box			0
he must 've been wondering how much more covering he had to do			0
against @entity67 , @entity1 conceded a penalty and scored an own goal in @entity2 's 4 - 2 victory at the @entity107 stadium the defender was in the @entity110 international squad for this summer 's @entity111 in @entity112 but did n't feature just before half - time , he knew for sure			1
a low ball was played into the box and @entity116 , completely free , took a touch before shooting narrowly passed the left post			0
@entity100 pointed at the space and looked over at his defensive partner , questioning why so much was allowed			0
and it was heart - in - mouth stuff a minute later when he failed to clear the ball and @entity36 got possession of it instead			0
in his defence , he hustled the player across the pitch to win the ball back			0
there was a moment of promise , midway through the second half , when he dived back , at full stretch , to intercept a rapid @entity25 break to stop what would have been a certain goal			1
that is by no means £ 32m defending , though			1
