’ stood by her man : @entity6 and @entity80 at their wedding last year prior to him being redeployed their big day : @entity6 recovered to the point he had a wedding free from complications of his amputation the downward spiral caused him to suffer severe mood swings including ‘ extreme anger , ’ now - wife @entity46 lamented			1
@entity6 also started convincing friends to take him to nearby bars where he drank heavily			1

the pills and drinking left him in a ‘ zombie - like ’ state , said @entity80			1

‘ keep your feet and knees together , ’ he kept reminding himself – one of the first lessons taught to paratroopers			0
‘ he landed pitch - perfect , ’ his proud father said , recalling the afternoon he spent in the landing zone			0
‘ at that point , he walked over and said , ‘ okay , i can do this			0
’ pitcher was soon recommissioned into the prestigious @entity145			1
he was then redeployed to @entity2 in november , and has led a platoon of 21 paratroopers into battle as if nothing ever happened to his foot - as if the prosthetic blade was never attached to his leg just below the knee			1
he is one of only 57 amputee soldiers to return to combat , and only the second paratrooper			1
grueling combat duty does take its toll on @entity6 – he is not allowed to take @entity16 anymore , the pain can sometime be excruciating			1
‘ you just have to accept it ’s going to hurt and deal with it your own way , ’ @entity6 told the paper from his post			2
he then jokingly took a knife and held it at the end of his ‘ blade ’ – like a bayonet			0
