' mr @entity25 said that the pair got undressed and started to engage in sexual activities			1
he added : ' there was a knife on the table next to the sofa and she picked it up			2
' she started running the blade up and down his chest and torso , softly at first			0
he said she said " it turns me on , trust me , i wo n’t hurt you "			0
' @entity1 put the knife down for a short time before picking it back up again			1

' she then stabbed him twice to the back through his shirt			2

' i wo n’t dwell on the circumstances that led up to the actual act of violence because that ’s already been well set out			0
' but the long and short of it are that there came a time when you stabbed this man twice in the back and that is obviously a very serious thing to do			1
