nearly every rumoured feature of the @entity1 and @entity1 turned out to be true , except one – the sapphire screen			1
instead @entity4 unveiled 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch handsets that both feature ‘ ion - strengthened glass , ’ during last week 's launch			1
and now reports claim the sapphire screens were set to be included on the new devices , but the plans had to be abandoned when they kept failing drop tests			1
source claims @entity4 had to abandon its sapphire screens after they repeatedly cracked during tests carried out by @entity4 suppliers @entity4 already uses sapphire crystal in its @entity26 on the @entity27 ( pictured ) synthetic sapphire is a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			1
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity4 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity44 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity27 and to protects the phone 's camera			2
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity49 currently used in most high - end smartphones			2
@entity52 analyst @entity51 told @entity53 that recent supplier checks spotted ‘ several reports of the sapphire failures			2
’ during standard drop tests , the screen was said to have repeatedly cracked , forcing @entity4 to resort to another method			1
@entity53 additionally reports that the decision to switch screens was made just weeks before the launch event			0
a sapphire screen , however , was included on the @entity64 and it is thought the smaller , 1.5 - inch display was n’t as fragile as the larger displays			0
a recent survey from @entity68 found that the sapphire screen was the most wanted new feature on the next - generation devices , among 45.5 per cent of customers			1
this was higher than the number of people who wanted an improved battery life and larger screen			0
mobile phone insurance firm , @entity80 , has seen a 31 per cent increase in damage claims across the @entity83 over the past year , and this has been linked to weak screens			1
the only full sapphire - screened mobile phone currently available is the @entity88 , a super-deluxe model that costs £ 6,750 in the @entity83 and $ 11,300 in the @entity90			0
aside from the drop test claims , @entity4 is also thought to have abandoned sapphire screens because of the technology ’s price			1
it ’s estimated that a traditional glass screen costs a manufacturer around £ 1.80 per phone ; a sapphire screen is believed to cost around £ 18			0
by the time that extra cost has filtered down to the consumers on the high street , customers could be looking at a phone that ’s £ 100 more expensive than a normal glass - fronted model			0
a recent survey from @entity68 found that the sapphire screen was the most wanted new feature on the device , among 45.5 per cent of customers			2

@entity141 , a popular @entity118 host claimed last month to have got the screen from well - known @entity4 leaker @entity143 , who recently made his own video showcasing the display			2
' i slowly realised there is absolutely no way i can break this display under my own power , ' mr @entity141 said			0
' the worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much			0
' the glass is also extremely high - quality , mr @entity141 noted : ' there ’s absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass			2
' @entity4 already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the ' home ' button and camera lens in the @entity27 , but the rest of the current @entity1 front display is made of @entity49 .			1
