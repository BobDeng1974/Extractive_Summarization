by @entity0 when @entity1 was raining bombs down on the @entity3 of @entity4 during @entity5 , @entity6 , a much - loved printworks , kept going			1
an oil bomb hit the print - shop ’s back garden but the presses in the shop basement in @entity13 , @entity14 , kept on rolling			1
an incendiary bomb landed in the cistern of the outside lavatory too , but only succeeded in burning off the roof			2
in another raid , @entity19 , an auxiliary fireman in the evenings when he was n’t at his daytime printing job , was killed by a collapsing wall hit by a bomb			2
and , still , the presses did not stop			2
@entity26 , a much - loved printworks in @entity13 , @entity14 , has been forced to close its doors after 117 years due to heavy parking fines and high business rates given out by @entity31 the oldest printing shop in the @entity3 , it has been in business since 1897 — printing pamphlets for @entity36 , leader of the @entity37 , at the turn of the century			1
but last month , @entity39 , 82 , finally shut up the shop that his grandfather , @entity41 , built in the final years of @entity44 @entity43 ’s reign			1
@entity1 could n’t stop the @entity45 — but @entity31 ’s parking policy has			2
after 60 years of running the family shop , mr @entity19 has now retired along with his wife — who used to work in the shop , selling toys — to their home in @entity53 in @entity54			1
even if there had been a viable business to take over , there are no @entity19 children to run the business			1
‘ the buck stops with me , ’ he says			2
in mr @entity19 ’s shopfront window , sits a forlorn printed notice — one of his last printing jobs			1
it reads : ‘ @entity66 – this shop will be closing at the end of may			2
we have been here for 117 years , printed for the @entity37 , survived enemy bombing through two @entity72 and now we are finished due to @entity31 ’s parking policy ’			1
a spy camera on a pole nearby issues fines to every customer who stops outside in a car — and the shop no longer earns enough to pay the council ’s high business rates			1
even a local church minister was fined £ 65 when she stopped her car outside to pick up two heavy boxes of paper for her church			1
there is a bay outside mr @entity19 ’s premises that promises 20 minutes ’ free parking for loading			2
but two spy cameras at either end of a stretch of @entity13 snap away every five minutes — and if the car is not actually being loaded when those photos are taken , a £ 130 fine ( halved if paid promptly ) wings its way to the poor unsuspecting customer			1
‘ once bitten , they just do n’t come back again , ’ says a wistful @entity39 , a sprightly , jocular figure with fond tales of old @entity3 life			2
@entity102 @entity39 , from @entity53 , had to pay a £ 2,000 instalment of the £ 6,300 annual business rates - money he could n't afford as parking rates had put off customers ‘ it ’s been bad for the last ten years or so , ever since the council introduced harsher parking restrictions			1
once , it was possible to park everywhere round here for free			0
the rates used to be manageable but now they just do n’t make sense			1
‘ the council makes more than we do out of the shop			1
’ @entity117 is not the only small firm to be brought to its knees by the army of council parking wardens across the country			1
figures show £ 150,000 of spot fines are issued by councils daily thanks to @entity128 cameras			1
and in the last five years , town halls gave out £ 310 million in traffic and parking fines			1
the final straw for mr @entity19 came last october when he had to pay a £ 2,000 instalment of the £ 6,300 annual business rates			1
but the firm — crippled by a lack of customers , sparked by the council ’s parking policy — was no longer able to pay its way			1
@entity141 — @entity142 ’s @entity141 , @entity44 — visited recently in a bid to help the businesses of @entity13			1
but she could n’t save @entity145 and so mr @entity19 had to make the tragic decision to pull the shutters down on more than a century of family history			0
the property developer who bought the building from him will convert it into flats			0
founder @entity41 began the business as a paper - bag maker to satisfy the demand for bags printed with shop details , in newly - built premises			1
his wife , @entity159 , sold toys there too			0
this pattern — of a mr @entity19 doing the printing and a mrs @entity164 selling toys — continued for three generations right until @entity39 ’s day			0
you can still make out the faded adverts for @entity170 cars and chopper bicycles ( ‘ for trendy shoppers ’ ) , pasted onto the original @entity173 timber shop fittings			0
the counter has been rubbed away into a smooth , gentle dip by a million transactions ; one glass - fronted cabinet has a wooden edge nibbled away by the punctures from a thousand drawing pins			1
during @entity185 , the business , which had expanded into bookbinding , remained open , and in the 1930s , @entity41 designed a new paper tea package			1
the business flourished in @entity188 , thanks to government printing contracts — fulfilled even as the @entity5 began			1
‘ the shop garden was destroyed by an oil bomb and the high wall flattened the garden , ’ says @entity39			1
‘ my grandparents had a lucky escape as they only got out of the @entity198 shelter before the wall came down on it			0
’ @entity19 , his volunteer firefighter uncle , was n’t so lucky			0
one of the printing presses in action			0
@entity142 's @entity141 , @entity44 - visited recently in a bid to help the businesses of @entity13 - but she could n't help the business ‘ he was manning a pump just round the corner , when a bomb brought a wall down and killed him			1
‘ his wife was pregnant with his first child , who he never saw			0
a blue plaque marks the spot where he died			0
’ mr @entity19 has removed his historic presses from the basement			0
they ranged from a 1900 @entity220 press to a 1952 @entity221			0
trays of type still remain in his first - floor office — like all master printers , mr @entity19 can still read print backwards as it lies set in metal			2
on his desk sits a page of metal print , set in 1950 , that reads , ‘ @entity231 : @entity233 testing			0
’ among the equipment the @entity45 owned was a 1939 @entity236 press			0
‘ my father bought it , ’ says mr @entity19 , ‘ we were about to pay the @entity239 when war broke out			2
we paid the @entity242 government instead			0
i never found out if they paid the @entity239 later			0
’ most of the presses have been taken to @entity246 , in @entity247 , @entity248 , to form part of a private collection of vintage printing machines			0
but one remains – the 1900 @entity253 press on which the @entity254 printed leaflets for the @entity37			2
this press is to go on show at the @entity258			0
‘ my grandmother was a @entity37 , ’ says mr @entity19 , ‘ she made my grandfather do their printing for free			0
’ the printing presses , one pictured , at the business helped print pamphlets for the suffragettes during the fight for the vote			1
mr @entity19 remembers talking to his grandmother about the @entity37 , he says mr @entity19 remembers talking to his grandmother about the @entity37			0
‘ i think she was the muscle for the movement , ’ he says , smiling , ‘ i was telling her a story about how the @entity277 pushed someone into a canal , and she said she ’d done the same for the @entity37			0
’ the @entity277 also used to get their printing done for their boxing promotions at @entity145 ‘ the twins were decent blokes , ’ says mr @entity19 , ‘ if anyone mugged an old lady around here , they ended up on the wrong side of the twins			0
’ by the time the @entity277 hit the @entity3 , @entity39 was running the family firm			0
his father died in 1954 , at the age of 53 , and @entity39 had to give up a career in the @entity294 , to run it			0
‘ as the business was still employing a large staff and family members , i had to buy myself out of my very happy @entity294 career , ’ he says , ‘ i have been stuck here since then			2
’ mr @entity19 is n’t a sentimental man but you can sense a sadness beneath his chirpy exterior			0
‘ i was happy to carry on working , ’ he says , ‘ i do n’t like being beaten			0
’ you can see why			0
if your family has seen off @entity1 — and the @entity309 — it ’s deeply depressing to be killed off by the parking czars of a tinpot council .			2

@entity26 in @entity13 , @entity14 , closed its doors after 117 years
