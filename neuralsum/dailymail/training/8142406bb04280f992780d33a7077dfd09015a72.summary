with its dirty sheets , empty vodka bottles , cigarette butts and discarded underwear , it is the most infamous bed in the world			0
having recently sold for more than £ 2.5million , @entity7 ’s artwork ‘ @entity6 ’ , the product of a chaotic low point in her life when a failed romance resulted in severe depression , must also be among the most expensive			1
but despite being directly inspired by the messy scene left after she spent four days in bed after the break - up , a leading art expert has cast doubt on whether @entity18 ever actually slept in her crumpled creation			1
with its dirty sheets , empty vodka bottles , cigarette butts and discarded underwear , it is the most infamous bed in the world @entity30 , emeritus professor of art history at @entity32 , inspected the 1998 artwork , which comes with a dossier of photographs of the detritus and instructions for where to put each object every time it is reassembled , in its various incarnations , including its first display in @entity42 and in the 1999 @entity44 exhibition after it was shortlisted for the award			2
professor , @entity30 , an authority on @entity47 , said : ‘ i began to wonder … have any of those beds really been slept on continuously over four sweaty and desperate days ? ’ he noticed the creases are ‘ caused by rumpling , not sharp , compressed creases caused by a warm body ’ , the pillows show no compression by a head and the bed - base of the @entity42 version has a different graining pattern			1
‘ look at the various incarnations of @entity6 and it ’s clear that the detritus of @entity62 ’s legendary four days in bed has been reconfigured a good deal , ’ professor @entity30 said			1
‘ discussions tend to be about autobiography , about feminism , obvious theoretical things , all of which are relevant … nobody has really looked at these as i would look at versions of a @entity47 painting … but despite being directly inspired by the messy scene left after she spent four days in bed after the break - up , a leading art expert has cast doubt on whether @entity18 ever actually slept in her crumpled creation ‘ it ’s not just some things not arranged scrupulously , which is fine			1
they ’re actually different items			0
’ he concluded that the different versions are not one bed in which @entity18 slept for a long time , adding that if she had lain in the bed ‘ its conservation state would be pretty horrendous			1
‘ organic materials do n’t do nice things if they ’re left … why does n’t it smell ? ’ he wondered			2
advertising executive @entity92 , the ex-husband of chef @entity93 , bought the work for £ 150,000 in 2000			0
he sold at auction it to an anonymous buyer for £ 2,546,500 in july , more than triple the guide price of £ 800,000			0
despite his observations , professor @entity30 regards @entity62 as a ‘ brilliant ’ artist and says the myth she created behind ‘ my bed ’ should not be taken literally			1
he plans to include ‘ @entity6 ’ in his new book to be published next month			2
@entity30 , emeritus professor of art history at @entity32 , inspected the 1998 artwork , which comes with a dossier of photographs of the detritus and instructions for where to put each object every time it is reassembled , in its various incarnations asked about professor @entity30 ’s comments , @entity18 , 51 , who was awarded a cbe for services to the arts in the new year honours list two years ago , said : ‘ the bed came directly from my flat			1
when i say ‘ @entity6 ’ i mean it was the idea of the artwork			2
‘ the bed has gone through many transformations			0
in a way it ’s a self - portrait			0
it ’s like a ‘ @entity130 - ian ’ theory of the soul : the candle burns , but the wax still remains in a different form … as i get older my face changes , my skin changes			2
‘ every time i reinstall the bed it will always be different			0
[ after my death ] , the people … will install it differently because of the nature of how i haunt the room			0
‘ the bed is the physical ghost of my own existence			0
