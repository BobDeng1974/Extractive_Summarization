by @entity0 @entity2 mp @entity1 , pictured arriving for an earlier court hearing at @entity4 ' in march			1
she has now been cleared of two charges relating to the anti-fracking protests outside energy firm @entity8 's exploratory oil drilling site on the outskirts of @entity10 on august 19 2013 @entity13 ’s only @entity12 mp has vowed to continue her fight to end fracking after being cleared of obstructing a public highway and a public order offence during high - profile protests			1
the @entity19 mp was arrested outside energy company @entity8 ’s exploratory oil drilling site in @entity10 , @entity21 , last august 19			1
she was among a group of protesters who had linked arms outside the site , which had become a national focal point for anti-fracking protests			0
during the trial at @entity29 alongside four co-defendants , @entity31 , 53 , said she ' wanted to express solidarity ' by protesting peacefully			2
she was found not guilty of the two charges she faced - willful obstruction of a public highway and breaching an order under @entity37 of the @entity38			1
outside court , she said : ' we are pleased that the court upheld our right to peacefully protest against fracking , but this judgment is not a victory or cause for celebration			1
' we will continue to campaign to end fracking and only celebrate when our world is on the path to a clean energy future			1
' ms @entity1 ’s co-defendants - @entity53 , 22 , from @entity54 ; @entity55 , 50 , from @entity56 , @entity57 ; @entity58 , 42 , from north east @entity59 ; and @entity60 , 39 , from @entity61 , @entity62 - were also cleared of both charges			1
ms @entity1 told the trial she felt it was important to protest about fracking in a bid to prevent the @entity13 being locked into using more fossil fuels			1
she said : ' i ’m haunted by the idea that my children and my children ’s children will turn round to me and say , " what did you do about this overwhelming threat ? " @entity1 was arrested on the same day that activists linked arms to resist police officers as they cleared the road outside the main entrance to the @entity8 exploratory drilling site in @entity10 , @entity21			1
it came as part of anti fracking demonstrations which inclided two days of ' mass civil disobedience ' ' and i want to do all i can do peacefully to address that before it ’s too late			1
' ms @entity1 told the trial that governments were failing to urgently address the issues surrounding climate change			1
and she said she felt the protest outside @entity8 ’s main entrance was a ' legitimate ' and ' appropriate ' way of sending a message to the government about fracking concerns			2
although @entity8 did not frack at the site , its drilling operation sparked concerns that it would go on to do so in the future			0
prosecutor @entity103 told the trial that a large camp formed near the site ’s entrance and extra officers were drafted in because of the vast number of protesters			2
a notice under @entity37 of the @entity38 was imposed , requiring demonstrators to use a designated protest area away from @entity8 ’s entrance			0
police remove a protester from the entrance of the @entity8 site in @entity10 , @entity21 , on august 19 last year - the same day that mp @entity1 was arrested during the protests police had to escort a tanker in to the test drill site operated by energy firm @entity8 , near @entity10 , @entity21 ms @entity1 told the trial it felt important and ' symbolic ' to be based outside the main gate during the protest , which lasted about five hours from around 10.15am			1
giving evidence , she denied being told of a designated protest area by police , adding : ' i could n’t see any reason why we could n’t continue our peaceful protest			2
' @entity134 @entity133 , of @entity135 , told the court he approached ms @entity137 , said there was a section 14 notice and asked whether there was anything he could say to move her			2
ms @entity137 - who was elected as the @entity2 ’s first mp in the 2010 general election - replied no and was arrested			0
she went on : ' if we had another 10 to 15 minutes we could have come to an agreement to end it and dispersed			0
we were n’t doing anything different than we were in the previous five hours			0
' explaining how he reached his verdicts , district judge @entity149 said the prosecution had failed to satisfy him that ms @entity1 had ' the requisite knowledge ' about the section 14 order being in place			2
' all the defendants said that they would have moved if it had been necessary to permit access to emergency vehicles			0
none of these defendants was ‘ locked on ’ to each other or to any object			0
' environmental activists locked themselves together at the main entrance to the @entity8 exploratory drilling site as part of the demonstrations in august hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves high pressure liquid being pumped deep underground to split shale rock and release oil or gas supplies			0
fears have been raised over the potential for small - scale earthquakes and water pollution , and that a drive to exploit new gas reserves will turn the focus away from efforts to develop a low - carbon economy to tackle climate change			0
@entity8 drilled horizontally for some 1,700ft through @entity186 formation , a type of limestone , at a depth of around 2,350ft below ground level			0
but later its chief executive @entity191 said the rock underneath the drill site , at @entity194 , was already naturally fractured , and the company had no intention of fracking there			0
the cost of policing the lengthy protests at @entity10 was nearly £ 4 million , prompting @entity201 police and crime commissioner @entity202 to seek financial aid from the @entity204 .			0
