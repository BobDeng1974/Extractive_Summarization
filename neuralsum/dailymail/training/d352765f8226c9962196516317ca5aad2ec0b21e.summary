by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 8 august 2012 @entity2 : 09:59 est , 8 august 2012 accused : dr @entity3 , 52 , is said to have put the toxic heavy metal into his wife 's morning coffee a respected @entity8 doctor who was nominated for a national award has been accused of poisoning his wife for at least five months by putting @entity11 into her morning cup of coffee without her knowledge			1
dr @entity3 , 52 , is said to have put the toxic heavy metal into wife @entity16 ’s beverage which he brought her in bed every morning in what seemed to be a tender , loving gesture			1
in fact each drink was causing her to have stomach problems and feel lethargic , court documents allege			1
mrs @entity27 ’s torture came to an end when she supposedly saw him doing it and secretly took a sample which she gave to police			1
she was shocked when tests showed it contained a high level of @entity11 - which is used in mouse poison and can be fatal			1
when mrs @entity27 stopped drinking her morning coffee her condition mysteriously improved , and police told her her previous symptoms were consistent with @entity11 poisoning			1
she has now filed an emergency order of petition against her husband and won temporary custody of their two children , aged 12 and 11			2
the astonishing case suggests that behind the couple ’s apparently happy marriage of 14 years and dr @entity27 ’s good standing in the community lay a dark desire to harm his wife			1
he has no record of disciplinary action against him and in march was nominated by the @entity68 @entity69 as a top local physician for @entity71			2
his wife first noticed she was ill last year and according to the @entity72 actually turned to her husband for treatment on what could be the problem			1
but in the court petition she said that everything changed in march this year when ‘ i found my husband putting an unidentified substance in my coffee , as he usually prepared my morning coffee for me ’			1
mrs @entity27 's attorney @entity82 said that in the following months she lived a horrific ‘ game of chess ’ in which she inspected every piece of food or drink in the house before trying it			1
evidence : mrs @entity27 's torture came to an end when she supposedly saw him doing it and secretly took a sample which she gave to police devastating : barium is used in mouse poison and can be fatal or lead to paralysis each day she would take a sample of the coffee and secretly gave it to officers who carried out more tests			1
she also had to live with the fear she was being paranoid - or that her husband had actually be poisoning her			0
ms @entity82 said : ‘ she followed her instincts			0
i 'm so glad she 's able to be in the house by herself now			1
because she went through hell			0
barium is a radioactive chemical with the symbol @entity11 and the atomic number 56			1
the heavy metal occurs naturally in the environment and is silvery white in appearance			0
its most well known use is as @entity120 in a contrasting agent in x-rays - the patient swallows a liquid containing a low dose and it shows up on the scan			0
it is also used in mouse poison , as an alloy for spark plugs , steel deoxidisers and rubber products			2
some light bulb coatings contain barium oxide			2
@entity11 can not be digested by the body so will cause poisoning if ingested , especially as it reacts when it comes into contact with water			0
those who work with the chemical are advised to wear flame resistant rubber clothes and a gas mask			2
if somebody is poisoned with @entity11 they are advised to force themselves to throw up to get it out of their system , and go immediately to the emergency room			0
symptoms can include stomach problems , brain swelling , weak muscles and damage to the liver and kidneys			0
it can also cause cancer and the effects of ingestion can last for a year			0
‘ this weekend she finally got a good night 's sleep for the first time in months			2
’ she added that it ‘ does n’t seem like much of a coincidence ’ that mrs @entity27 ’s condition improved the day she started drinking her coffee			2
‘ before the results , everything was so incredible			0
because it is hard to believe , it really is ’			0
barium is normally used in the medical or chemical industry and is put into fireworks and matches			1
it is also used in stomach x-rays as a contrasting agent			0
some kinds are absorbed into the body but it can be fatal if too much is consumed			0
it also affects the nervous system and cause heart problems and paralysis , but is hard to come by and the poisoner may have got it from a nuclear pharmacy , which is not open to the public			0
@entity190 , managing director of the @entity191 , said : ‘ essentially what they ( @entity11 molecules ) do is they block one of the chemicals in our body that is used for nervous tissue and for maintaining control of heart rhythm called potassium ’			0
no criminal charges have been filed in the case and police admit they can not say for sure who put the @entity11 in mrs @entity27 ’s drink			1
the petition states that dr @entity27 can only go back to the family home in @entity210 if his wife ’s lawyer and police are present			1
police have also searched the $ 350,000 property and come out with a number of bags marked ‘ evidence ’			2
@entity219 , executive director of the @entity60 and @entity220 , which oversees dr @entity27 ’s license to practice , said its procedure was to wait until legal matters were resolved before taking action			2
speaking out : mrs @entity27 's attorney @entity82 said that she lived a horrific ' game of chess ' in which she inspected every piece of food or drink in the house before trying it he said : ‘ @entity234 takes this matter very seriously and has a process to review the membership status of a member physician who has been convicted of a felony or found guilty of unprofessional conduct that brings the medical profession into disrepute			1
‘ i found my husband putting an unidentified substance in my coffee , as he usually prepared my morning coffee for me			1
' @entity243 the case of apparent spousal poisoning has already drawn parallels with ‘ @entity252 murderer ’ @entity253 who drugged her husband with a milkshake laced with sedatives then battered him to death			0
it has also been compared to that of ‘ @entity264 ’ @entity261 who poisoned her husband @entity262 with antifreeze			0
a judge will review the order of protection and temporary custody order on august 14			0
dr @entity27 did not respond to requests for comment from local media			2
mrs @entity27 declined to comment .			0

dr @entity3 prepared his wife 's morning coffee in their @entity8 home
@entity16 became lethargic and ill , so she had the drink tested by police
they found barium , a toxic chemical used in *rat* poison
