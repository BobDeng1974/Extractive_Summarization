@entity0 is the real deal			1
it might not have been the stunning knockout victory many had predicted , but the 6ft 7in giant from @entity5 was crowned the new heavyweight champion of the world on saturday night			1
he produced a composed and mature performance against @entity10 in @entity11 to win the @entity13 title and add substance to a career hitherto laden with hype			1
@entity0 , who had knocked out each of his previous 32 opponents before the fifth round , twice had @entity10 in trouble but was unable to find the finish while the @entity22 struggled to stamp his authority on the fight			1
the judges were all in agreement , scoring the fight 118 - 109 , 119 - 108 and 120 - 107 to @entity0			1
both @entity45 and @entity48 were on hand to watch , as was @entity50 , who fought often on the big stage as heavyweight champion in the 1970s and 80s			1
and @entity0 became the first @entity53 to hold a piece of the heavyweight title since @entity56 reigned briefly in 2007 and 2008			1
the challenger controlled the opening stages of the first round , boxing on his back foot but using his rod - like jab to good effect			2
@entity10 was happy to stalk his taller opponent around the ring but was reluctant to let his hands go until the final seconds			2
one of the biggest questions before the fight was @entity0 's ability to take a punch but he was untroubled by a left hook to the head in the second round			1
the challenger was in control as the clock ticked down before he suddenly unleashed a barrage of shots			0
the bell sounded as @entity35 slipped to the canvas and although no knockdown was called , the @entity22 was rocked			0
the champion took his time to warm into the third stanza as @entity0 kept him at range with his long left hand			1
@entity10 did land a couple of body shots midway through but was otherwise a virtual bystander as @entity0 dropped his hands , smiled and taunted his rival			1
but the champion looked more comfortable in the fourth round , closing the gap and landing with a solid left hook			2
he finished strongly to notch his first session of the night			0
@entity0 's ram - rod jab was the cornerstone to his success as he boxed cleverly throughout the 12 rounds @entity0 unloaded with his right hand on several occasions but was unable to stop the stubborn @entity35 @entity0 celebrates after the fight as he prepared to be named the new heavyweight champion of the world @entity0 yelled at the crowd over the ropes after proving he had the stamina and the chin at the highest level @entity0 runs to the ropes to celebrate after the final bell ( left ) and shows off his new @entity13 heavyweight belt @entity0 was by now in uncharted territory and he sensibly returned to boxing behind his jab			1
with a minute remaining , however , he unleashed his right hand and wobbled @entity10 but the champion showed his mettle to remain on his feet and the attack fizzled out			1
and it was @entity10 who enjoyed his best round of the fight as it approached the halfway stage			2
a left hook to the head stunned @entity0 against the ropes but he recovered quickly and flashed another grin			2
if one thing was beyond doubt , it was @entity35 's ability to absorb a punch			2
@entity135 through the seventh round , @entity0 landed a stiff left - right combination which sent the champion staggering backwards			1
but he stayed upright and his chin soaked up another barrage of right hands			0
both men took a breather in the eighth stanza with @entity0 retreating behind his jab and @entity10 restricted to the odd flurry			1
few had expected the fight to go the distance but after nine rounds , @entity0 looked to be heading for a points victory			2
as he took to his stool , @entity10 was told he was ' miles behind ' on the scorecards			2
and the crowd began to jeer as @entity0 remained content to keep the champion at range			1
both men were visibly tired in the penultimate session with neither able to launch a sustained attack			0
@entity0 's corner implored him to be smart as he sat three minutes away from claiming one of the greatest prizes in sport			1
and he did n't let them down as he smothered @entity10 and celebrated in typically exuberant style , shouting into the camera as @entity165 once did , perhaps fittingly on @entity167 's 73rd birthday			1
@entity10 sat slumped in his corner between rounds knowing he had to deliver a knockout to win the fight @entity0 twice rocked @entity172 but discovered the @entity22 would not easily be stopped at the @entity44 @entity0 's right hand had helped him put away his 32 previous opponents but @entity10 was made of stern stuff @entity0 lands a right hand on @entity35 up close as he continually got the better of the exchanges @entity0 was untroubled for large parts of the fight but when he was caught , showed he could take a punch ' i answered a lot of questions tonight , ' he said			1
' we knew we could go 12 rounds , we knew we could take a punch			0
all the hard work is done in camp			0
did i look like i had fun ? i really did			0
' there was n't a better opponent than @entity10			2
i wanted to prove i could do it and i did that			0
i do n't want anyone to doubt me anymore			0
' i thought i was going to knock him out in four rounds but when i saw he could take a great punch , i knew i was in for a long fight			0
' i want to bring excitement to the heavyweight division			0
i want to fight four times a year			0
' @entity10 claimed he was not at his best as he surrendered the title he won against @entity204 last year			1
' it was n't my night , ' he said			0
' i did n't feel 100 per cent			0
i just could n't cut the ring off or move my head like i usually do			0
' i congratulate him but i 've got to go back and learn from my mistakes			0
' i was trying to throw combinations of four and five punches but i got through two of them			0
this was n't me at all			0
i was n't able to do what i wanted to do			0
