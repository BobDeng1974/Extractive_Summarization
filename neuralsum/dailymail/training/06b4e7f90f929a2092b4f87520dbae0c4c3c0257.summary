@entity182 , an expert in medals at @entity149 , said : “ @entity184 was awarded 11 medals and four of these were gallantry awards			0

' @entity112 is recognised as the @entity12 ’s best war time low level navigator			1
he was flying in mosquitoes and making attacks on specific targets as low as 50ft			0
' the raids executed by @entity199 speak for themselves			0
they were some of the most famous raids of @entity17 and are illustrative of the precision required to plan and execute them			0
' @entity9 was responsible not for blanket bombing but for precise targeting with pinpoint accuracy at low levels			1
they were n’t called " @entity209 daylight spectaculars " for nothing			0
