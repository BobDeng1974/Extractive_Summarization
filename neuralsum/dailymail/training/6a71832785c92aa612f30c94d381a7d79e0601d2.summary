inspire is produced by @entity1 and contains exhortations to carry out so - called ' lone wolf ' terrorist attacks by self - motivated groups and individuals			1
pictured is an advert from the magazine the @entity11 terror attack has chilling echoes of a previous plot to kidnap and behead a @entity16 @entity15 soldier			1
five men were jailed in 2008 after police smashed a @entity21 - based terror cell ’s plan to burn a kidnapped soldier ’s body and parade his head on a stick as a warning to other @entity15 against joining the @entity29			1
thankfully , ringleader @entity30 failed to identify a soldier to target before they were detained by the security services			1
@entity30 had links to @entity1 in @entity42 and said in a conversation bugged by @entity44 : ‘ like that , i think you cut it off like you cut a pig			0
then you put it on a stick and we say , this is to all @entity15 man [ who ] want to join the @entity36 ( non-believer ) army – this is what will happen to you			1
‘ then we throw the body , burn it , send the video to the chacha [ @entity1 leaders ]			0
the chacha can release it there			0
these people gon na go crazy			1
’ the words of @entity30 , jailed for life , were an ominous warning			0
last night , as armed police guarded two men suspected of killing and trying to behead a soldier near @entity11 barracks , detectives were urgently trying to establish how the killers were radicalised			1
officers were checking jihadi websites where preachers of hate urge @entity73 extremists to behead soldiers			1
the authorities will also be investigating whether the attackers had been spurred into action by reading @entity1 ’s @entity78 , @entity0			0
the publication is produced by @entity1 and contains exhortations to carry out so - called ‘ lone wolf ’ terrorist attacks by self - motivated groups and individuals			1
articles and ‘ jihadi advertisements ’ have urged people to carry out attacks with knives and to run people down in vehicles			1
the @entity93 bombers used instructions contained in the first issue of the magazine to build and detonate their devices			1
the guide was called ‘ how to build a bomb in the kitchen of your mom ’			1
@entity0 has been linked to at least 15 terrorism cases and @entity1 made an abortive attempt to publish the 11th issue of the magazine just days ago			1
it is believed that intelligence agencies intervened in the publication process , meaning that the file was blank when people who downloaded it tried to open it			2
a previous issue was doctored so a section on bomb - making was replaced with cupcake recipes			1
inciting hatred : a @entity15 protest in @entity119 in 2006 documents such as @entity0 are circulated on a network of websites which are attracting large audiences			1
a recent survey suggested the ten leading websites linked to @entity1 have 125,000 registered members between them and may be attracting as many as 250,000 visits per day			0
the network is currently circulating a new @entity131 magazine produced by the @entity42 @entity132 , which calls on supporters in the @entity16 to murder teenage human rights campaigner @entity134			1
another possibility , which will be considered by counter-terrorism officers , is that the minds of the killers of the @entity16 soldier were poisoned in a mosque or even in prison , an increasingly popular recruiting ground for groups linked to @entity1			1
it was not clear whether the men were on the intelligence radar of the security services or were ‘ clean skins ’ , not known to police			0
some witnesses claimed the soldier was beheaded but there was no immediate confirmation of how he died			2
what is not in doubt is that he suffered a terrible knife attack			2
the head and the sword have a specific place in the rhetoric , heraldry and history of @entity73			0
there is no shortage of passages in the @entity168 that jihadists can interpret to support their propaganda			0
vigil in the street : three women bravely stand near the body of the soldier , saying prayers and trying to offer comfort @entity177 , is a favourite of those with evil intentions : ‘ when you meet the unbelievers ( in battle ) , smite their necks until you have crushed them			2
’ jihadists have used this as justification for the scores of beheadings of non-believers in @entity191 the word ‘ behead ’ is typed into @entity193 , the search engine automatically suggests completing the sentence with ‘ those who insult @entity73 ’ – suggesting this is the most common search term beginning with that word			2
the attack in @entity11 is one of several attempts to kill soldiers and mps			2
student @entity203 became a heroine in jihadi circles for stabbing mp @entity206 during his constituency surgery in @entity208 , @entity119 , in may 2010			0
a cell of terrorists from @entity211 was jailed last month at @entity212 for discussing an attack on a @entity215 barracks with a bomb attached to a remote controlled car			2
three weeks ago six men pleaded guilty in the same court to planning an attack on an @entity222 rally in @entity223 , @entity224 , using machetes and sawn - off shotguns and a home - made bomb			2
placards calling for anyone who insults the @entity231 to be beheaded were waved during an angry protest in @entity119 in 2006			0
one man , @entity233 , who carried a placard that said ‘ behead those who insult @entity73 ’ , was later found guilty of inciting racial hatred			2
hoodie : a @entity239 top like the one the murdered soldier was wearing the soldier killed by two crazed fanatics just yards from the @entity243 was wearing a @entity239 top when he was attacked			0
the young serviceman was hit by a car and crushed into a road sign on the street in south - east @entity119 before he was brutally murdered			0
video footage showed the dead man was wearing a dark blue top with white writing on it - which is believed to be the same as the @entity239 hoodie ( right )			0
the killers attacked him with a collection of weapons including meat cleavers and knives before waiting for police to arrive , their hands covered in blood			0
today members of the public were donating to the charity which helps wounded troops with their rehabilitation			0
one man called @entity270 who donated to the charity wrote : ' in memory of the soldier brutally murdered yesterday - rest in peace - and a thank you to all of our brave service men and women who do so much for us ' @entity281 , who also gave to the charity wrote : ' last night a black cloud went over our country , it will never be the same again , rip to this young man brutally slain in his home @entity287 salute you x ' to donate to @entity239 yourself , go to www.justgiving.com/helpforheroes murdered : the soldier ( left ) appears to be wearing a dark blue @entity239 hoodie or t - shirt how the horror unfolded : the car rammed into a serving soldier , crushing him against a road sign			0
the attackers then brutally murdered the serviceman in broad daylight before they waited for @entity302 firearms officers to arrive who gunned them down			0
