a new report has revealed that not a single @entity2 city or town has what 's classed as superfast download speeds , set at @entity6 or above			1
the figures from @entity8 claim the fastest speeds are in @entity10 , at @entity11 , and this is despite the major networks offering contracts that promise speeds in excess of @entity17 , including @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
the latest state of the internet report by researchers @entity21 found the average user in the @entity2 realistically gets just @entity26 and this average puts @entity28 in ninth place globally in terms of speeds			1
the latest @entity22 of the @entity23 compared web speeds in 129 countries			0
@entity34 came top with an average speed of @entity36			2
the @entity2 tied with @entity37 to sit at the bottom of the top 10 because the average user gets speeds of just @entity26 this chart shows how the @entity2 compares to other countries in terms of average speeds			1
in positive news , speeds in the country did rise by 48 per cent in the past year in the report , the @entity2 is shown in tenth on the list because it tied with @entity37 for speed but comes after @entity37 alphabetically			1
ahead of the @entity2 is @entity34 , on @entity36 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and the @entity60			2
however , the @entity2 did see the highest speed increases year - on - year , with averages jumping by almost 50 per cent			2
the figures from @entity8 also found more than a quarter of @entity2 postcodes still struggle to get @entity66 and at these speeds it would take around six hours to download a high - quality film			1
focusing on the @entity2 's biggest towns and cities , @entity8 found @entity10 tops the list with average download speeds of @entity73 , while people in @entity75 get around half this speed , at @entity77			1
@entity78 came in at 26 with average download speeds of @entity80 , with almost a fifth of broadband users getting speeds lower than @entity84			1
this chart shows how web speeds compare across the @entity2 's largest postcodes			1
the research by @entity8 found not a single town or city in @entity28 has speeds classed as superfast , which is @entity6 or higher			1
@entity78 came in at 26th place in urban areas , @entity75 has made the least progress with speeds increasing just 26 per cent , compared to speeds in @entity98 that have rocketed by 87 per cent			0
@entity99 is also making progress , with speeds up 75 per cent since last year , yet it ’s still one of the slowest @entity2 cities for broadband with over a third not seeing their average speeds break the @entity84 mark			1
back globally , @entity34 who came out on top with average speeds of @entity36 dropped 6.4 per cent from the previous year			2
new figures from @entity8 found that not a single @entity2 town city has what 's classed as superfast download speeds , which is @entity6 or above			1
this is despite the major networks offering contracts that promise speeds of between @entity17 and @entity118 , including @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			2
additionally , the government has set a target to offer superfast broadband to 95 per cent of @entity28 by 2017			0
government agency @entity122 has a budget of £ 530 million to invest in public broadband			0
in the @entity60 , the @entity125 had the fastest average speeds at @entity127 - up 17 per cent from the previous year			2
@entity128 was in tenth place with @entity130			0
speeds were much more consistent across @entity60 districts and in some instances varied by just @entity134 , on average			0
@entity136 lost 0.4 per cent , compared to the previous quarter , to 10.3 mbps , @entity137 lost 3 per cent to 10.8 mbps , and @entity138 lost 7.9 per cent , down to 10.7 mbps			0
additionally , @entity139 saw a 27 per cent quarter - over - quarter loss that dropped it not only out of first place , but also out of the top 10 entirely			2
the slowest state was @entity144 with @entity145 , despite a 5.6 per cent quarterly increase			0
@entity21 is a cloud company that specialises in internet use and compiles its state of the @entity23 at various points throughout the year			0
it looks at speeds , as well how many people use the internet , security and mobile use in 129 countries			0
average connection speeds across the world based on surveyed mobile network providers ranged from a high of 9.7 mbps down to a low of just 0.5 mbps			0
yet traffic doubled over the past year			0
@entity164 , telecoms expert at @entity165 , said : ' urban speeds in the @entity2 are around three times faster than rural speeds , but even download speeds in @entity28 ’s 50 biggest cities still are n’t superfast			1
' the government ’s blinkered focus on bringing superfast connections to 95 per cent of @entity28 by 2017 is all very well but , if they pull it off , it ’s only half the battle won			0
' if people do n’t actually use super-fast broadband because it ’s too expensive , or they do n’t know they can get it , then what ’s the point ? uptake will be heavily dependent on both price and awareness			0

average global speeds increased at the start of the year to @entity66
the @entity2 and @entity37 were tied at the bottom of the top 10 list on @entity26
no @entity2 postcodes *reached* speeds over @entity6 , the *threshold* for superfast
@entity10 was top with average download speeds of @entity11
this is despite many broadband contracts promising @entity17 or higher
