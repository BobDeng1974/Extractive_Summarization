@entity0 told @entity2 supporters @entity3 will always belong to them and urged those travelling to sunday 's title clash against @entity6 not to turn on the club legend and record goalscorer			1
@entity3 is on loan the @entity10 from @entity11 , the @entity13 team owned by @entity6 which he joined in the summer after 13 years at @entity15			1
' it does n't matter what team he is playing for now , ' said @entity0			1
' he belongs to us			2
he is a @entity2 player , for what he did			1
he made the crowd shout and cheer his name and cheer for us , a lot of times here			2
videos scroll down to watch ... if selected , @entity3 will face @entity2 on sunday after 13 years service at @entity15 @entity0 has urged the @entity2 faithful to show @entity3 due respect at the @entity10 ' it 's a pity that i 've come back and he 's not here anymore but i know for sure i will be happy to see him again			1
i ca n't wait to see my partner in crime			0
' he 's part of the history of this club and the fans know what he gave for the club			0
they know what he did			0
so i know the reaction will be good			0
i know that , for sure			0
' @entity0 , 36 , is a @entity2 player once again after two years away			1
he returned last season to play against @entity47 's team for @entity48 in the @entity49			2
he received a rapturous ovation from fans at the @entity15 and found it hard to cope with the emotion , as will lampard if he plays at the @entity10 on sunday			2
' i did it and so i know it 's going to be difficult , ' said @entity0			1
' but i know @entity3 and he will do his best			1
' @entity3 , also 36 , made his city last weekend in a 1 - 1 draw at @entity58 and was an unused substitute against @entity60 on wednesday			1
if @entity62 selects him on sunday , it will be his first involvement against @entity2 since march 2001 , when he was in a @entity64 team beaten at @entity65			1
@entity3 struggled on debut for @entity6 , where he 's on loan before joining @entity11 in the @entity13 the former @entity69 and @entity2 star got a yellow card and was substituted at half - time against @entity58 in 13 years at @entity2 , he won 11 major trophies : the @entity73 three times , the @entity75 four times , the @entity77 twice , the @entity78 once and the @entity49			1
he also scored a record 211 goals for the club			1
most of the trophies – and many of the goals - involved @entity0 , who has returned to @entity83 in a role as player - coach as manager @entity47 attempted to replace some of the experience and winning mentality lost when @entity3 and @entity88 left the club			1
' it 's good to be back , ' said @entity0 , who started the first game since his return in the 1 - 1 draw against @entity94 , in the @entity49 , on wednesday			1
he has been in pain from an ankle injury suffered in pre-season which has restricted his involvement and accepts there is pressure on him to somehow emulate his first spell at the club , which ended in sensational style when he scored the winning penalty in the shoot - out to win the @entity49 final			2
' the pressure you get is when you win something , ' said @entity0			2
' when we won the @entity73 for the first time , the pressure was to win it a second time			2
when i finished as the top scorer in the @entity73 , they expected me to be top scorer the next season			0
that 's part of our lives , and we 're used to it			0
@entity0 and @entity3 celebrate one of their many successes together at @entity2 loyal servant @entity3 as he was farewelled from @entity83 in may with a record 211 goals for the club ' it 's a different season for me but when i signed to come back here i knew that			1
i can only work hard and show the manager like i did on wednesday			0
i need to do that improve my condition			0
' i 'm preparing myself to give something extra to the team and achieve what we want to achieve			0
i 'm here to help but i 'm also here to show them the right spirit , if i can say that			0
even if i do n't have any doubt about their desire to win , i 'm here to help and i will give what i can			0
' another key part of his role will be as mentor to @entity146 , the £ 32million centre - forward who has started his @entity2 career with a blaze of seven goals in five appearances , and has many similarities to the @entity152 in his style of play and his life story			1
' he 's the striker we needed this season , ' said @entity0			2
' for him to start the season in @entity69 , coming from @entity160 , which is a very different league , and to recreate the same thing he was doing at @entity163 , is fantastic			0
he 's really good and he 's enjoying being with us			0
that 's the best feeling he could have			0
' like me , he came to this level a little bit late			0
when i look at him , i can see the desire to win every challenge , to score goals			2
he is hungry for goals and that 's the best thing for a team like us			2
' if @entity146 's hamstrings are up to it , he will return in place of @entity0 at @entity11 where a win will move @entity2 seven points clear of the champions after only five games			1
' i hope we can continue the way we 've started in the @entity73 against @entity6 , ' said @entity0			1
' i think we can and i hope we can			0
we will go there to try to win , like we 've gone out to try to win every game this season			0
let 's see what 's going to happen			0
