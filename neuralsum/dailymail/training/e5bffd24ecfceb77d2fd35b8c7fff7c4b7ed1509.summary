male culture : @entity1 , @entity2 's most senior female officer , says women are put off armed units because they do not want to carry ' big guns ' fewer women want to be armed police officers because they do not want to carry ' great big guns ' , @entity7 's most senior policewoman has said			1
assistant commissioner @entity1 says that there is an overwhelming male ' culture ' in armed units despite more women ' flooding in ' to other departments			1
women had in the past been forced to adopt ' manly ' traits to get ahead , including dressing like men , not using make - up and having to ' swear more ' , ' drink more ' and ' drive faster ' , she said			2
but the senior officer says that has ' completely gone ' at the @entity23 , but a macho - culture remains in firearms			1
' i have to say , and it hurts me to say it as an old - school feminist , i do believe in our society and our culture , fewer women who join the police actually want to be armed , ' she told a @entity35 meeting			1
' i would n’t put it down to genes necessarily – i ’d put it down to culture			0
in my lifetime it will always be more men using police firearms than women			2
' we find it easier to have women in some of the areas like personal protection — where you happen to carry a firearm but it 's all about other skills , surveillance , you happen to carry a gun in certain departments but it 's all about other skills — than we do to get women interested in standing outside the embassy with a great big gun '			1
mrs @entity1 , who joined the force in 1983 , said the @entity23 has changed for the better			2
there are more women but the figure still stands at eight to 10 per cent of the total number of officers , she said			2
' a lot of the pioneers had to force themselves to be very manly , ' she said according to the @entity70			0
' they even dressed all like men , they wore grey charcoal suits and nobody would wear a lot of make - up or clothes that were feminine			0
' some of them took on quite excessive traits , they would swear more , drink more , and drive a heavy car faster			0
and all that ’s just completely gone '			0
@entity7 is currently being sued by its ' poster girl ' firearms officer who claimed her career was held back because of her race and sex			1
@entity90 , 34 , says she was intimidated by an ' aggressive ' inspector who gad once ' scolded ' her in front of other senior officers while he was armed with a taser and a handgun , reducing her to tears			2
row : @entity90 , was the poster girl for the @entity23 at @entity98 , but is suing the @entity23 for racial and sexual discrimination , right at the tribunal the elite @entity102 officer , who helped safeguard @entity103 from terror attacks during the @entity105 , claims she was picked on by a supervisor who monitored her @entity108 account where she had posted images of herself in a bikini			1
only authorised armed units are allowed to carry guns			1
the main @entity2 forces usually have one , but larger forces like the @entity23 will have substantially @entity116 officers at the @entity117 , @entity118 , and @entity119 also have permission			0
here are the list of weapons they might carry : glock 17 pistol ( right ) @entity125 pistol @entity127 pistol @entity129 pistol @entity131 @entity132 ( right ) @entity133 @entity134 @entity136 shotgun @entity137 meanwhile in february two ‘ petite ’ firearms officers were told to expect a pay - out of £ 70,000 after winning a sex discrimination case over the size of their big guns			1
the weapons were too large for their small hands and as a result they could not reach the trigger , their employment tribunal against the @entity119 heard			0
@entity149 and @entity150 also struggled with the grip of the pistols they were using – a @entity154 – and they also claimed their heads and legs were too small for their protective gear			0
a female marksman was involved in disarming the murderers of @entity161 last year			0
the officer involved in the @entity164 shooting is one of only a handful of women in @entity7 ’s elite @entity168 unit			1
in @entity103 , although women fill about one in five police roles , they represent only a tiny proportion of firearms officers			2
the markswomen are highly trained and treated as equals in their units – if it falls to them to shoot at a suspect , so be it			0
their skills are prized by police commanders , who desperately want to increase their number			0
they believe the presence of female officers at highly charged confrontations can often help defuse violence			1
in recent years the @entity23 has held women - only recruitment days for its firearms units and appointed existing female officers as @entity192 officers even considered running training sessions for women with childcare responsibilities – and investing in lighter firearms.in a recent interview , one woman firearms officer said : ‘ men and women have a different viewpoint			1
women have a defusing effect , calming things down			0

@entity1 says that women do not want to carry ' great big guns '
@entity208 says female officers are ' flooding ' everywhere but not to armed units
' it hurts me to say it as an old - school feminist , i do believe in our society and culture , fewer women who join the police actually want to be armed '
