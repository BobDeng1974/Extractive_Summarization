dr @entity1 , 69 , spent 30 years as senior pastor at the @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity15 , before the affair with @entity17 came to light in 2008			1
the scandal rocked the church and its congregation and led to the sacking of the bishop , who had been married to his preacher wife , @entity23 , for more than 30 years at the time			0
but , despite signing an agreement promising to leave the adjoining vicarage , when it actually came to moving time , the former met police officer refused to get out			1
even when the church paid out £ 465,000 to buy him a new home to live in rent - free for life , dr @entity1 refused to go , branding it a ' hovel ' , unfit for an invalid and right next door to a travellers ’ camp			1
but now , after taking the case to the @entity39 , the church has won an order forcing dr @entity1 to give up the vicarage , known as @entity42 , and hand it over for the use of the church ’s new senior pastor			1
' it ’s a farce , there is no justice , ' complained dr @entity1 as he left the court following the hearing			1
the church ’s barrister , @entity51 , told the court it had been trying to get dr @entity1 out of @entity42 since 2009			2
he had been dismissed a year earlier after news of the affair hit the headlines and he had lost an employment tribunal claim over it			0
' some four years later , he has n’t moved out and is now running a new ministry from @entity42 , ' said the lawyer			0
' dr @entity1 has long been dismissed from his employment and @entity13 is trying to get back the immediately surrounding land , which is supposed to be used for the occupation by the senior pastor			1
' mr @entity51 said the doctor had signed a consent order last year , promising to move out and into the new house which the church was going to buy for his use			0
dr @entity1 's affair with @entity17 ( left ) came to light in 2008			1
he is pictured right with @entity23 , his wife of 37 years but dr @entity1 said he had no intention of moving out , because @entity42 was ' his ' , the court heard			1
it led to the church launching a claim for ' specific performance ' , a court order forcing the priest to do what he had promised			0
dr @entity1 contested the application , arguing that the consent order had been obtained by ' undue influence '			2
the church and those working for it had put undue pressure on him at a time when he was ill from having had a heart attack and his wife had recently died , he said			0
ruling in favour of the church , judge @entity92 described @entity13 as a church based on ' traditional christian ethics and strong family values '			0
' the arguments advanced on behalf of the defendant , dr @entity1 , are without merit , the defence he seeks to put forward is nothing more than a sham , ' said the judge			2
' it ’s a great shame that a man who has given a great deal to the church over a lengthy period should now seek to resile from an agreement he entered into , freely and with full consent			0
' in the circumstances , therefore , i propose to grant summary judgment			0
' the former policeman was sacked from his position as bishop after the affair came to light in 2008 the judge said dr @entity1 would have to apply directly to the @entity120 if he wanted to challenge the decision or to have it delayed			1
