by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:37 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 18:38 est , 9 may 2012 she was a child of 13 walking along a road in her school uniform when she first met ‘ friendly ’ taxi driver @entity6			1
but that meeting would change her life for ever , leading to her being plied with cheap alcohol and taken to a house in @entity11 , @entity12 , and raped			1
now , seven years later , she sits alone in a dingy one - bedroom flat , reliving the sickening way she was groomed for sex by an older man she trusted			1
haunted by her past : one of the victims of the sex grooming gang ( left ) has spoken about her abuse at the hands of taxi driver @entity6 ( right ) who plied her with booze and raped her when she was just 13 now on medication for depression and suffering from panic attacks , the mother - of - one has little hope that she will ever recover from her horrendous ordeal			1
yesterday , @entity6 , 35 , was jailed for a total of 12 years for rape , sexual activity with a child , conspiracy and trafficking			1
born in @entity36 , his young victim lived in cramped conditions with her parents , three sisters and four brothers on a run - down council estate			1
her father who had worked as a security guard had started experimenting with drugs while she was a toddler and by the time she was in her teens , he was a full - time heroin addict			1
in order to escape her home life , she followed in her older sisters ’ footsteps and began ‘ going with ’ @entity52 men and ‘ jumping ’ into their cars			1
evil : eight of the nine gang members , including @entity6 ( top row , second right ) , who were jailed for a total of 77 years yesterday for preying on a string of young girls she said : ‘ i was young and stupid and i just followed my sister and got involved with this guy			1
‘ i did n’t really know what i was doing			1
i was just a kid and i would have agreed to anything			2
‘ i totally got in with the wrong crowd and i was taken advantage of			2
’ at the age of 13 she would meet the @entity52 taxi driver who would end up raping her and subjecting her to years of abuse			1
recalling the moment they met , she said she was still in her school uniform walking down a street near her home when he told her to get in to his car so that they could ‘ chill ’ together			1
‘ he thought i was my sister because we looked very similar			2
but even when he realised i was her younger sister he still asked me if i wanted to chill with him and he told me to get into the car			2
sickening : @entity6 ( front ) has been jailed for 12 years after subjecting his victim to years of abuse ‘ he handed me this plastic bottle which was full of boost and vodka and i just started drinking it because i did n’t know any better			1
‘ we were driving for quite a long time and were just chatting about random stuff and then before i knew what was happening we arrived in this street with blocks of terraced houses			2
‘ it was just a normal house with furniture and it looked like someone lived there			1
‘ it had a couch , telly , fires , beds , wardrobes			2
he said he was living there because he was working in a cash and carry in @entity11			2
‘ i carried on drinking from the bottle and we just sat in the living room for a bit			2
but then i just remember feeling really drunk and he started touching me and then told me to go upstairs			2
‘ i just did as i was told because i was a kid and we went into the bedroom and we slept together			2
‘ i was totally out of my head and ca n’t really remember much			2
i do n’t really want to remember and have blocked most of it out			2
‘ afterwards , as if everything was normal i just got dressed and he told me to get back in the car and then he dropped me back off at home and we did n’t talk about what had just happened and i did n’t tell anyone			2
’ but the nightmare for the youngster was not about to end			0
she was forced to continue to have contact with the taxi driver for most of her teenage life			0
she said her father would send her round to the taxi driver ’s house to beg for money in order to sustain his drugs habit			1
she said : ‘ my father was on smack and he knew that if i went round to @entity138 ’s house and sat with him he would give me money			1
‘ so dad would send me round all the time and i just did as i was told			0
‘ @entity138 would ask me to sit near to him and then he would grope and touch me and at the time it just felt quite risky because i was young and did n’t realise exactly what was going on			0
‘ i would try and move out of the way but he would want me to sit close to him and i remember just thinking i needed to do it to get the money for my dad so he could go and buy his drugs			0
‘ i should n’t have let him do that and it makes me think that i got into the wrong crowd when i was younger			0
‘ i try and block it out because i ca n’t bear to think about it			0
he is a dirty old man and i was young and stupid			0
‘ i feel like he took advantage of me because i did n’t know any better – i was just a child			0
’ the abuse carried on until last year when the woman was contacted by the police after they found her number on @entity6 ’s mobile phone			1
‘ i had no idea that i was part of something so disgusting			1
it makes me feel sick now			0
‘ there are more girls out there who they did the same to , but half of them are too scared to come forward and tell people that they have been abused			0
’ relieved : a 19 - year - old ( not pictured ) has told of her lucky escape from the sex grooming gang and how she provided information that led to the conviction of the men ‘ i feel incredibly lucky that i managed to escape from them , ’ said the 19 - year - old who came close to becoming a sex grooming victim			1
the teenager was able to provide police with evidence which would lead to the conviction of the men			0
her background is similar to many of the young girls involved in the case			0
she grew up on a council estate and her parents ’ marriage broke down whilst she was in primary school			1
she is a teenage mother and is also a full - time carer for her disabled father			0
when she was at high school she became involved with the ‘ @entity36 girls ’ – a group of teenagers as young as 12 who would ‘ hang around ’ with @entity52 men			1
she said : ‘ there was an older girl who was in a relationship with one of the @entity52 men and our group of girls would go with her to the @entity208 takeaway in @entity209			1
‘ at first we did not go into the back of the takeaway , we would just sit in the front and have a can of @entity214 and talk			0
but then the older girl , who has got a bit of a reputation for being a hard nut and a bully , started threatening some of the younger ones about going in the back with the men			1
’ the young mother was 15 when she first went into the takeaway with a friend			0
‘ at first we sat downstairs and then this guy who we all called “ @entity225 ” told us to go upstairs into the back room because he did n’t want us to disturb the customers			0
‘ there were two dirty mattresses on the floor and a table and two chairs with some blinds			0
you could tell they were using it for something bad because there were empty plastic packets which looked like they had cocaine in them on the floor			0
‘ i went up for five minutes and when i saw all this i just thought i need to get out of here			0
i did n’t feel comfortable at all so i left			0
some of the girls came with me but others stayed			0
‘ and some girls started going all the time			0
when they came to school they would brag that they got free food , beer and drugs and used to tell us what they did			1
’ the teenager said the men would do anything to get the young girls into the back room and even spiked their drinks			0
and she said they would regularly grope the girls as they sat at the front counter in the takeaway			0
she said the girls would get harassed by the gang as they walked through the town centre			1
she said : ‘ @entity225 would randomly walk the streets and he would stop the girls and then talk to them			0
’ the youngster is disgusted that the gang described the girls as prostitutes in court and said she is still struggling to move on with her life			1
she said : ‘ the girls were doing it because they were scared and they were too young to know any better			0
