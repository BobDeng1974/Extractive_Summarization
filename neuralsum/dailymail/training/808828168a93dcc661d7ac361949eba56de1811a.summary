@entity0 has found himself at the centre of another race row over a survey which asked @entity5 members to ' rate an immigrant ' @entity0 was in another race row last night after asking supporters to rate ‘ blacks , @entity12 and @entity13 ’ in a game – with prizes of cash and a @entity5 golf umbrella			1
the ‘ rate an immigrant ’ survey is part of a @entity5 private survey of members aimed at helping the party draw up its policies			1
sent last week by @entity5 chairman @entity23 , it asks members to say ‘ how close they feel ’ to a number of groups			1
they include ‘ @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity12 , @entity31 , @entity32 ’ as well as the four main political parties			0
@entity5 activists are urged to rate each on a scale from 0 for ‘ not close at all ’ to 10 for ‘ very close			1
’ but the survey was slammed as a racist stunt after details were leaked to @entity39			1
last night , senior @entity41 mp @entity40 condemned the @entity5 survey as ‘ shocking ’			2
mrs @entity40 , who won a campaign against the @entity44 in her @entity46 constituency in east @entity47 , said : ‘ this openly brings race into politics			0
it ’s shameful , it ’s shocking and it ’s offensive			0
' it lifts the lid on the unacceptable face of @entity5			0
’ the survey comes after a series of claims of racism involving @entity5 , although @entity0 has insisted ‘ stupid or offensive ’ comments by a handful of candidates ‘ never have and never will ’ represent the views of his party			2
the email to thousands of @entity5 members from chairman @entity23 is headed : ‘ @entity68 and @entity69 ! ’ it declares : ‘ @entity5 is growing quickly			2
we want to strengthen our party by understanding our rapidly growing membership			0
we are asking all our members to complete a new survey			0
’ the aim was to ‘ use the insights to strengthen the @entity5 operation … your responses will be invaluable in making sure we fulfil our promises over the coming years – and in government ! ‘ so please , do complete the survey			2
it should be fun ! you might even win some prizes ! ’ the party leader ( pictured calling for debate on @entity91 referendum with other party members outside no. 10 @entity93 ) insisted ' stupid and offensive ' views of individuals were not those of the whole party prizes included ‘ one prize of £ 100 , two of £ 50 , three prizes of a @entity5 golf umbrella , four prizes of £ 25 , five @entity5 notebooks and six @entity5 pocket diaries			1
’ other @entity5 race rows include : a @entity5 spokesman denied the survey was racist , claiming every major employer carried out similar research of their staff .			0
