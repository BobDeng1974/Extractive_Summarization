@entity6 said : ‘ it ’s great that you have got these contingency plans and you have got these people able to come in and you have trained them up to step in			2

’ earlier , he said of the workers : ‘ they are a disgrace , are n’t they ? ’ mr @entity9 said he did not want to ‘ escalate ’ the row but admitted ministers had discussed the idea of sacking immigration staff , whose walkout on thursday could paralyse @entity16 on the eve of the @entity77 opening ceremony			1
he added : ‘ sack them ? that is the @entity80 approach and i can tell you that among ministers there have been people asking whether we should be doing that			0
