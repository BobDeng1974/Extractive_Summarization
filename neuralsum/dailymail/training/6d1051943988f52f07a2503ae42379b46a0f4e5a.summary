the @entity1 government recently revealed its investigations into 12,000 encounters with ufos spanning between 1947 - 1969			1
@entity5 of these cases , collectively known as @entity7 , have become available for anyone to view online			1
now some of the strangest from the collection have been highlighted , revealing the mysterious objects in the sky that left @entity14 hunters baffled			0
the @entity19 said that these lights were most likely caused by birds named plovers , whose white breasts could reflect lights from the city below one of the most famous is the @entity17 incident , which was reported on august 30 , 1951 in @entity18 by three professors , according to a report by @entity29			1
the witnesses were sitting in the backyard of one of the professor 's homes when they saw 20 to 30 ' lights ' fly overhead			0
one of the professors said the objects ' appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate and they were greenish - blue , slightly fluorescent in colour			1
' they were smaller than the full moon at the horizon			0
there were about a dozen to fifteen of these lights ... they were absolutely circular ... it gave all of us ... an extremely eerie feeling			0
' this image , titled simply ' @entity53 ' , was taken in @entity54			0
while the photographer believed this to be a flying saucer , the @entity19 concluded that it was in fact a lenticular cloud			1
the lens - shaped formations are the result of moist air that has condensed at a high altitude @entity63 saw nine ufos over @entity65 , on 24 june 1947 and the @entity1 government agencies took an interest in reports			1
a similar sighting ( pictured ) occured over @entity70 , @entity71 on july 12 , 1947 this image was taken on april 15 , 1965 in @entity73 , @entity74			1
there are no additional case files with this photograph			1
the @entity19 says that the @entity7 included 12,618 sightings reports , with 701 of which remained ' unidentified ' @entity7 was the name for a project that investigated @entity14 reports between 1947 and 1969			1
it was the third study of its kind			0
the first two were projects @entity87 ( 1947 ) and @entity88 ( 1949 )			1
the aim was to determine if @entity14 were a threat to national security , and to scientifically analyse @entity14 - related data			2
the @entity19 says that @entity7 included 12,618 sightings reports , with 701 of which remained ' unidentified ' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files			1
a termination order was given for the study in december 1969 , and all activity under its project ended in january 1970			2
the @entity19 concluded that these lights were most likely caused by birds named plovers , which have white breasts that can reflect lights from cities below			1
another image , titled simply ' @entity53 ' , shows what the photographer believed to be a flying saucer			1
however , scientists discovered that the eerie shape was a lenticular cloud which are created by moist air that has condensed at a high altitude			2
the clouds are formed when the air temperature drops and moisture droplets are pushed up a steep slope by high winds			0
a more straightforward case can be seen in images of a ufo taken in @entity123 , @entity124 on august 3 , 1965 by highway worker @entity125			0
distant objects are hazy in the images because of the @entity129 smog , while the @entity14 is not			0
some suggest this is because the @entity14 is in fact a small object that was close to the camera			0
the @entity19 says that the @entity7 included 12,618 sightings reports , with 701 of which remained ' unidentified ' – or around 5.5 per cent of the files			1
the files , which can be accessed here , were previously only available by visiting the @entity139 in @entity140			2
' there is plenty of work for amateur investigators to try to come up with explanations they never had time to consider or research , ' @entity142 author of the @entity14 investigations @entity144 told @entity145			2
one case that mr @entity142 is particularly intrigued in for historical reasons is a report filed by @entity63 which led to the popular term ' flying saucers '			2
this image was taken in @entity159 in 1949			0
it is similar to a number of other images submitted , and has no case file associated with it found on july , 1957 in @entity165 , the mysterious rock was thought to be from an alien civilisation			0
experts initially said it was a meteorite that was over a century old			0
but after testing , they changed their minds and claimed it was a displaced piece of sediment from a glacier no case files are associated with this image , which looks like a flying submarine			1
it was taken on december 27 , 1954 in @entity179 , @entity180			0
mr @entity63 saw nine ufos over @entity65 , on 24 june 1947 and the @entity1 government agencies took an interest in reports			2
a similar sighting occurred over @entity70 , @entity71 , just a month later on july 12 , 1947 ' they flew in a diagonal formation that stretched about five miles from the first to last craft , and they bobbed about erratically , ' said mr @entity142			2
' he estimated that they travelled faster than 1,000 miles per hour as they flew from @entity65 to @entity192			0
' when describing the sight to newspaper reporters , mr @entity63 said it was ' like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water			2
' this , said mr @entity142 , reveals that the term flying saucer came from the description of the movement of the craft rather than their appearance			1
' explanations from mirages , secret aircraft to the flight of pelicans have all been used to try to explain his sighting but it still remains a mystery , ' he added			0
these images were taken in @entity123 , @entity124 on august 3 , 1965 by highway worker @entity125 using his @entity218 camera			0
this object supposedly flew over the @entity221 @entity220 in broad daylight , but no one else saw it			0
distant objects are hazy because of the @entity129 smog , while the @entity14 is not			0
some suggest this is because it is small dust that was close to the camera pictured is the staff of @entity7 , which recorded more than 12,000 encounters with ufos			1
sitting in the centre is @entity237 , the last chief officer of @entity7 the once - top secret files were previously only available by visiting the @entity139 in @entity140 ( left ) , but have recently been made available online ( right )			1

the files relate to @entity19 investigations from 1947 - 1969 that were recently made available online
one of the most famous is the @entity17 incident , which was reported in @entity18 in 1951
another shows what the photographer believed to be a flying saucer , which turned out to be a cloud
more than *700* cases in @entity7 remain *unsolved* , accounting for 5.5 per cent of the files
