by @entity0 published : 03:54 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 14:44 est , 11 april 2013 a lesbian businesswoman is helping homosexual learner drivers dodge old - school driving instructors by opening @entity6 's first ‘ gay driving school			1
’ @entity7 , 27 , started @entity8 after friends complained about jokes being made by instructors about their sexuality when having lessons			1
she said stories of instructors referring to pupils as ‘ faggots ’ or grilling transgender youngsters on whether they are a boy or a girl had left her horrified			1
@entity7 , who works as a driving instructor for the @entity22 , runs ' the @entity8 ' , aimed at making the experience of learning to drive easier for the @entity24 and she said some gay leaner drivers pretended to be heterosexual because they felt uncomfortable revealing their homosexuality to a stranger			0
now miss @entity7 's solo business is creating a stir amongst @entity30 's @entity32 community with her promise to make pupils feel ‘ comfortable ’ over their sexuality when behind the wheel of her @entity37			1
on her website @entity39 says : ‘ @entity43 ? @entity42 / ts / tv ? looking for driving lessons with a friendly driving instructor in a comfortable learning environment ? then look no further ! i am a young , female , gay driving instructor			1
‘ learning to drive can be a daunting experience enough , without worrying about getting on with your instructor			0
‘ you will learn much better if you are relaxed , comfortable and most importantly yourself ! i am fully committed to teaching you to be a safe , conscientious driver whilst achieving that all important pink driving license ! ’ today miss @entity7 , from @entity55 , @entity30 said : ‘ the response i 've had so far has been very positive			0
the gay friendly service was launched in response to complaints to members of the lgbt community that other instructors had made them feel uncomfortable ‘ i have heard a lot of horror stories about people 's experiences with driving instructors , where they have had to explain their sexuality			1
‘ there have even been stories about transgender learners who have had to put up with jokes about their gender or questions about their looks			1
‘ as a pupil you 'll spend 40 to 50 hours learning to drive in very close proximity to a total stranger			0
‘ part of feeling at ease during your lessons is building a good rapport with your instructor - this is much easier when you can just be yourself			0
‘ a lot of gay people told me that they had strange experiences and it quickly became apparent that many of them said they 'd never felt that comfortable with their instructors			2
‘ i 've had a pupil come to me halfway through her training as her previous instructor shared many of his far - right political beliefs and extreme views on race , immigration and sexuality during conversations in the lessons that made her very uncomfortable			2
‘ i do n't think we should live in a world where all @entity32 people should only use services from other @entity32 providers - but i do think it 's important for people to have that option should they wish			1
‘ with this venture there is no need to explain yourself and its a lot more relaxed			0
you wo n't be met with a barrage of questions about your personal life			2
@entity7 's website offers a ' comfortable learning environment ' for people who are gay , bisexual , transgender , transexual or transvestite ‘ i think the people who have appreciated it the most are those who are transgender			2
getting behind the wheel for the first time is daunting enough without having to worry about how a driving instructor will treat you			0
’ the driving school , which is gay friendly and not gay only , is set up as an @entity22 franchise and @entity7 said the fact that the @entity37 car she uses looks discreet is a positive factor for pupils			1
the former @entity141 student said all of her pupils , more than 50 so far , have passed their driving tests in three attempts or less			0
some of the complaints made to @entity7 were issues such as constantly having to use ‘ non-gender ’ pronouns when chatting with their instructor , mentioning their ' partner ' rather than girlfriend or boyfriend			0
another complaint was having to lie about what they did for a living rather than admitting they worked in a bar in @entity30 's @entity162 gay district			2
@entity163 , from the @entity164 , said : ‘ unfortunately some people still face discrimination and homophobia in society today , so you should be able to feel more comfortable accessing @entity24 specific spaces or services			0

learners complained about having to lie to previous instructors
transgender learners faced questions on their gender from other instructors
