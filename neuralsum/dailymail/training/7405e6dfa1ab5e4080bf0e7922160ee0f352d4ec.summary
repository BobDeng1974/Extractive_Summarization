the residents of a @entity2 village feared they would not be buried alongside their ancestors after a historic graveyard was put up for sale as a domestic garden			1
however , a generous farmer and his wife have now stepped in and saved the cemetery - ensuring that future generations of local families will be laid to rest together			1
@entity12 and @entity13 are believed to have spent as much as £ 100,000 buying the land , which is attached to a disused @entity16 chapel in the village of @entity18 , near the @entity19			1
saved : this graveyard in the @entity2 village of @entity18 has been bought by a local farmer disused : the @entity23 has not been used as a @entity16 chapel since 2009 the @entity23 was put up for sale earlier this year , after falling into disuse around 2009 when a new church was set up elsewhere in the village			1
in the prospectus for the property , prospective buyers were told that although they would have to maintain the graveyard there was no obligation to allow new burials there			2
mr @entity37 , 59 , whose parents are buried in the cemetery , decided that he should buy it so that villagers could be buried in the same place as their relatives for decades to come			1
he and his wife negotiated with the trustees of the chapel to split off the graveyard and buy it separately , for a price believed to be around £ 100,000			1
' the graveyard is an essential part of our community , ' mrs @entity13 said			2
' my husband 's parents are both buried there and he went to @entity56 in the chapel			0
' it is an important place for villagers , just about everyone here has someone who is buried there			0
' threat : the graveyard was going to be sold to the new owners of the chapel , who would not have had to allow new burials there the couple have now put the cemetery into a trust which will ensure that it remains available for the use of the local community			1
' the chapel has been closed for a few years and up until we bought it , the graveyard has been closed since july , ' mrs @entity13 added			0
' we are very pleased to have secured it on behalf of the local people			0
' we 've had a wonderful reaction from the village			0
we 've had phone calls , cards and been stopped in the street			0
' mr @entity37 , a dairy farmer , said : ' we are pleased with the way it 's turned out but we do n't want to make a big fuss			1
' it means there could be more burials there so people can be laid to rest with their loved ones			0
it 's a family graveyard			0
' trust : @entity12 and @entity13 have guaranteed the future of the graveyard for decades to come however , @entity37 and mrs @entity13 have not yet decided whether or not they will be buried in their own graveyard , as they are regulars at a church elsewhere			1
@entity106 , property officer for the @entity107 of @entity2 , said : ' we are pleased to confirm that a local farming family have set up a trust which has purchased the burial ground			2
' the declared objects of the group are to manage the land - primarily as a private burial ground			0
' the chapel , which was originally founded in the early 19th century and rebuilt in 1891 , is being sold at auction with a guide price of £ 80,000			2
it is set to be converted into a four - bedroom family home - but the graveyard will no longer be part of the property .			0

@entity125 in @entity18 , @entity2 was put up for auction
new owner could have *prevented* locals from being buried in the graveyard
but dairy farmer has spent £ 100,000 buying the cemetery to secure its future
