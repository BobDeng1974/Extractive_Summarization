@entity0 , a living legend himself , believes our own @entity2 will join him in the pantheon of ring superstars			1
and he expects @entity2 to prove him right whenever his chance comes to fight @entity7			1
@entity0 , now @entity2 ’s @entity8 promoter , has kicked off this son of @entity11 ’s big fight week in @entity12 by saying : ‘ @entity2 can become one of the all - time greats			1
and @entity2 has them both			0
' @entity28 is absolutely the best welterweight ever but @entity2 can be as spectacular as anyone in history			1
’ @entity2 has the opportunity to demonstrate as much on saturday night when he tops the bill at the @entity33 for the first time			2
he has starred at the @entity35 before but says ‘ the @entity36 is the biggest venue in world boxing			2
’ he will share that fabled ring with @entity40			0
the pair should have collided a year ago for the world title the @entity43 still held at that time			0
now they contest what many here are talking of as a final eliminator for the enriching privilege of becoming the next fighter to threaten @entity7 ’s unbeaten record			0
@entity51 ( right ) believes @entity2 ( left ) can be as good as anyone in the history of welterweight division @entity0 is hopeful that a fight between @entity2 and @entity7 can be sorted in the future @entity2 , who has twice lost world titles of his own , admits : ‘ i ca n’t afford another mistake			1
’ @entity0 does not expect him to slip up again			0
‘ the bigger the fight , the bigger the prize , the more @entity2 rises to the occasion			2
@entity17 is a very talented , very durable boxer but @entity2 is in the perfect place to fulfil now			0
’ @entity62 is their target but @entity2 ’s dream of finally clinching that long - promised bonanzat is threatened by a growing sense that @entity68 and @entity69 will come to terms at last for the richest fight of all time , the one the world wants to see			2
@entity0 says ; ‘ well , i ’m a boxing fan first and foremost and like everyone else in the game i want to see that fight and i believe it should happen			1
' but it annoys me that @entity2 keeps being promised his turn for a major fight and it does n’t happen			2
’ @entity7 is scheduled to take to the ring next in may and @entity69 has thrown down a challenge which boxes his rival for the mythical title of best pound - for - pound fighter into a corner @entity0 says ; ‘ if @entity7 does n’t meet @entity69 then i believe his only other option is to fight @entity2 , who in addition to his own @entity2 army of fans from @entity93 is recognised in @entity43 as very exciting			1
’ a @entity96 bout - involving @entity2 and @entity97 ( right ) - could be on the cards in the @entity99 @entity97 celebrates winning the @entity101 title after beating @entity102 in @entity103 in august 2014 there has also been talk of @entity2 taking on his former sparring partner @entity69 and @entity0 says : ‘ while @entity2 ’s speed would set huge problems for @entity7 , i think @entity69 would be slightly the more difficult fight for him			1
‘ but i ’m not saying he could n’t win			0
style-wise @entity2 is more trouble for @entity7 but he is a major threat to any welterweight in the world , both those guys included			1
‘ i ’m pushing for the @entity7 fight because @entity2 deserves it			1
and when does go in against @entity7 or @entity69 , do n’t be surprised if he wins			0
’ if @entity7 takes another route , again , one alternative for @entity2 is a @entity96 with @entity97 , who now brings a world title to the table and expects to return to the ring in @entity123 after being stabbed in the leg while on holiday			1
@entity2 has made it clear that will only happen if he dictates all the terms and conditions			0
@entity0 says : ‘ @entity129 in front of 100,000 people at @entity132 could be a fall - back position			0
but what i really want for @entity2 is the super-fight which brings his chance of glory			0
’ @entity139 will be televised live on @entity140 on saturday night			0

@entity2 faces @entity40 at the @entity36 in @entity12 on saturday
ahead of the fight promoter @entity0 has backed @entity2 to produce the goods ahead of *potential* fights with @entity7 and @entity97
former boxing legend @entity0 believes @entity2 ' can be as spectacular as anyone in the history of the welterweight division '
