it is an old fortress on a tiny island , surrounded by pine trees and the turquoise waters of the @entity4 – the sort of property that looks like it should play host to the great and good			2
indeed , for a long time , it has			0
three years ago , @entity9 hit the international headlines when a pregnant @entity12 - wife of the then - @entity14 president @entity13 - was photographed strolling on its terrace			1
@entity18 hideaway : the @entity9 was the holiday home of the @entity14 president from 1968 to 2013 for over four decades , the @entity9 has been the very private holiday retreat of @entity14 leaders – a hideaway that has witnessed the private sojourns of the @entity25 men ( and women ) of power			1
now , after 45 years of being a restricted area , it is open to the public			1
the current @entity14 president @entity31 has decided to break with tradition and show the villa to the population for the first time – as a symbol of a toned - down presidential lifestyle in tough economic times			1
however , there are also suggestions that he has dispensed with the property because he is not enamoured with the lack of privacy it affords			1
@entity13 holiday retreat : the former @entity14 president and his wife @entity12 , were fond of the retreat , and pictures of her with a growing baby bump in 2011 were broadcast round the world favourite of @entity14 presidents : @entity31 ( pictured with his ex @entity54 in 2012 ) is also a fan of the holiday location but has opened the doors to the public images of her with a growing baby bump , captured by paparazzi in may 2011 , broadcast news of her pregnancy to the world			1
the property has no swimming pool – forcing bathers out to the beach , giving any lurking photographers better opportunities to take pictures of presidential couples in swimwear			2
@entity13 was fond of the fort , using it as a regular summer base , and was often seen cycling and jogging in its vicinity			0
but after he married model - singer @entity12 , he also liked to escape to her more luxurious villa at @entity81			1
or is it ? although based on its own island , the property falls within range of paparazzi lenses the villa is located on one of the most beautiful parts of the @entity91 , some 25 miles east of @entity92 , and a similar distance west of the gilded resort of @entity95			2
it was a closed shop between 1968 and 2013 – but as of this summer , visitors can walk in its salons , dining rooms and offices			0
they should not , though , expect the marble , gilding and elegant parquet floors that you find in many @entity14 palaces			1
instead , the white walls and simple tiles on the floor – in the local @entity4 style – make it look like a family house			0
a certain simplicity : the property is more of a rustic @entity4 retreat than a grand palace the property ’s simplicity is its main attraction , says @entity120 , the administrator of the fort			2
‘ it is the charm of the place , ’ he says			0
‘ the president can live like ordinary people do , in a simple environment			0
’ built in the @entity129 , it became state property during the @entity131 of the late 18th century			2
former president @entity132 made it the official residence after spending a memorable – if not very pleasant – night at the fort in 1964			0
‘ he had a terrible night , because of the mosquitoes and a bed that was too small			0
he decided to renovate it , ’ @entity120 says			0
taking a peek : the public are now able to visit a property that hosted @entity14 leaders for over four decades since then , every @entity14 president has ventured to the property to take time off from the demands of the @entity147 in @entity148 , to rest under the sound of the cicadas , and to enjoy the private beach and the spectacular view from the patio			1
@entity154 and his wife @entity155 visited the island many times during his presidency ( from 1995 to 2007 ) , regularly meeting residents of the neighboring village			0
not ideal : some of the stylings in the property are decidedly dated - and its is very close to a public beach			1

@entity9 hosted holidaying @entity14 leaders for almost 50 years
then - first lady @entity12 was snapped at the property while pregnant
