' it just a normal @entity6 's outfit and the majority of people have had good laugh at it but one person complained saying they would go to the ' radio ' if i was still there when they had finished shopping			1
' in the end i was told to leave and to change the outfit			0
i could feel the tears begin to roll down my face and just sat in my car feeling drained of all my confidence			0
' the 63 - year - old was dressed as a @entity6 's pupil in a bid to collect for charity children with @entity14 ahead of his 12th @entity48 mr @entity21 , who has been fundraising in the same store for over five years , has raised over £ 28,000 for a number of charities through his efforts in the marathon			1
