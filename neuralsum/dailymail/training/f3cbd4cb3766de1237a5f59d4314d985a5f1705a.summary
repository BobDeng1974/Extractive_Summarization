miss @entity1 , 52 , made the comments during a debate with other legal professionals at the @entity26 on wednesday , entitled ' is rape different ? ' she said : ' we need to make a distinction between legal responsibility and moral responsibility			1
' the law does not attribute any responsibility now to the victim of rape whereas traditionally we know the judge would say when they came to sentence " well she was contributorally [ sic ] negligent " or something like that			1
' while outlining what she views as the received wisdom when discussing , miss @entity1 dismissed the idea ' that it 's morally absolutely unambiguous , the victim is utterly innocent and the victimiser is utterly guilty and this is infinitesimal			1
and finally that claims of victimisation must always be respected , anything less is victim - blaming			2
' miss @entity1 compared a rape victim to somebody who falls over whilst drunk to demonstrate that people can put themselves in a situation where they are more likely to fall victim to a crime			1
she also attacked a culture around rape which encourages people to ' realise ' they have been raped , and added that some victims go on to blame their ordeal for everything that goes wrong in their life			2
debate : miss @entity1 made her comments at a @entity26 event entitled ' is rape different ? ' @entity66 spokesman @entity65 condemned miss @entity1 's argument , telling the @entity22 : ' @entity1 shows how out of touch she is with the realities of sexual violence			1
as a society , we have moved on from the rape myths she continues to propagate			2
' miss @entity1 , a @entity74 graduate who has worked as a barrister since 1985 , has courted controversy on sexual offences before , by attacking the decision to double the sentence for broadcaster @entity80			2
his original sentence of 15 months in prison for 14 counts of indecent assault was increased to 30 months after a public outcry			0
she has also previously called for the age of consent to be lowered to 13 and criticised the ' witch - hunt ' of ageing celebrities accused of sexual abuse			0
miss @entity1 was unavailable for comment this morning			2
@entity1 has made a name for herself both as one of the country 's most respected lawyers , and as someone not afraid to ruffle some feathers with her outspoken views			1
a member of the prestigious @entity7 , @entity100 , who was called to the bar in 1985 , is regularly ranked in the legal 500 directory			0
she has won a barrister of the @entity105 award from the lawyer magazine after she fought for the rights of pregnant women against compulsory treatment			0
the @entity7 @entity112 guide has variously described her as ‘ bright , committed and passionate ’ , ‘ well - respected ’ , ‘ highly diplomatic ’ and ‘ a tough opponent ’			0
she writes on legal issues for the @entity116 website , and is often highly critical of the establishment			0
miss @entity1 has stepped into the firing line on numerous occasions in the past			2
responding to the controversial case in which a judge described a 13 - year - old sex attack victim as ‘ predatory ’ , she tweeted : ‘ it takes two to tango			0
disgusting tho ' these men are , frankly the girls are often not much better - and no shrieking martyrs			0
' she has also said that operation @entity130 , into sex abuse linked to @entity133 , ‘ has got out of hand ’ and was hijacked by ‘ moral crusaders ’			0
a storm of criticism met that suggestion , and she has also angered the @entity138 by suggesting at the same time that the age of consent be lowered to 13			0
at the time an @entity141 spokesman said : ‘ to trivialise the impact of these offences for victims is all but denying they have suffered abuse at all			0
