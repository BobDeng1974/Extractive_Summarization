a five - year - old boy has been left with horrific injuries after being knocked onto a concrete floor by a middle - aged woman during the post-christmas shopping frenzy			1

' @entity12 ran up to me and was crying , and said that someone had bumped into him , ' @entity5 told @entity15			1
five - year - old @entity12 , who had been trailing behind @entity5 and his partner , had been knocked flat onto the carpet of the store , which thinly covered the concrete underneath that had taken the full force of his little head			1
' he had been playing a game on my phone , which meant that he did n't have his arms free to break his fall , ' said @entity5 , a horticulturalist from @entity37 in @entity38			2
' i went up to the staff and asked what had happened , and they said that a lady had come up to them at the checkout			0
she told them that she had bumped into a child and fallen onto him , but that she had just got up and left , ' he said			1
@entity12 's head knocked onto the concrete floor of the store , resulting in a two centimetre raised lump @entity12 's father @entity5 said that @entity12 's mother was so terrified that he 'd cracked his skull that they drove 45 minutes away to @entity56 ' i was just shocked			1
i was completely mortified that a lady could fall on a child and not even pull up and check whether he was ok , not even apologise			2
' ' she just got up and left			0
i do n't understand how someone could do that			0
' @entity5 said that the lump began to swell immediately , blowing up to a raised two centimetre bump which extended from under his nose to around his eyes , covering his forehead			1
@entity12 had his face painted in the spirit of @entity6 festivities , makeup which @entity5 said melted off with his tears			1
' it just progressively got worse , darkening and swelling until he could barely see out of his eyes , ' @entity5 said			2
' the staff at @entity8 were amazing , really caring			0
they ran to get him an ice pack , and lollies , and filed an incident report right away			0
' @entity12 's mother , @entity78 , 30 , drove her son 45 minutes to @entity56 to have scans , as ' we thought he might have cracked his skull , ' said @entity5			1
' luckily he was physically fine , no broken bones , but i could barely look at him because his injuries were so terrifying			0
' @entity5 ( left ) a horticuluralist , said that @entity12 ( right ) is normally a very active boy with no fear @entity5 ( far right ) , with his partner @entity88 ( far left ) , and her daughter @entity89 ( right ) , with @entity5 's sons @entity91 ( middle ) and @entity12 ( right ) @entity12 , pictured here accepting his preschool diploma , turned five on @entity94 @entity5 and his family are determined to find the woman that knocked over @entity12 , and to make her apologise to him for all the harm she caused			1
' his mum was bawling her eyes out when she saw him , she 's been an absolute wreck , ' @entity5 said			1
' i would just like to find the lady , make her understand what happened to my son , ' he said			2
' he was so traumatised by it that when we went back the next day to say thank you to the staff i had to carry him into the store because he was afraid he would be knocked over again			2
' @entity5 said that @entity8 had treated the family with utter kindness , launching an investigation and following up on @entity12 in the days after the incident to see how he was faring			1
' when we went back in they asked him to pick out some toys , and let him have them for free			0
they 've been so caring and that 's the one positive thing that has come out of this , ' @entity5 said			2
@entity5 and his family are determined to find the woman that knocked over @entity12 , and to make her apologise to him for all the harm she caused @entity5 said @entity12 had been ' tough as nails ' , and that despite his injuries was in high spirits while the staff at @entity8 checked @entity132 footage in an attempt to identify the woman , the area where the incident happened was in the camera security 's blind spot			1
' it 's so heartless what she did , she knew what had happened , she reported it to staff , but did n't say anything to him , ' @entity5 said			2
' one of my friends started crying when she saw his injuries , and one of my partner 's daughters nearly threw up			1
it brought back memories of being beaten , ' he said			0
' that 's the terrifying thing			0
i ca n't believe that injuries my son has reminds someone of being hurt			0
it looks like i 've beaten him , people stare everywhere we go because he looks like a victim of abuse			0
' @entity5 said @entity12 , who turned five on @entity94 , had been ' tough as nails ' , and that despite his injuries was in high spirits			1
' it 's only when he looks in the mirror and realises that he does n't look like himself anymore that he gets upset , ' said @entity5			2
' he 's still a bit wary and that breaks my heart because it 's his birthday party this week			0
i ca n't believe he has to celebrate looking the way he does			0
' @entity5 said that @entity12 is a very active boy , who loves running around and has no fear , but that has n't stopped @entity5 from feeling scared for his little boy			1
' i 'm pretty shaken up about it			0
even now it gives me chills , i get teary just talking about it , ' @entity5 said			0
' i just ca n't believe that three days after @entity6 someone would do that to a little boy			0
where is your spirit ? do you not have compassion ? '			0
