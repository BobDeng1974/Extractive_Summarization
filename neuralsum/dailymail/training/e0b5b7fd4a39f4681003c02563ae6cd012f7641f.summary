by @entity0 a @entity2 aircraft carrier and and a nuclear - powered battle cruiser have passed through the @entity4 - escorted by a @entity6 warship			1
the seven - strong naval task group led by the @entity10 , @entity12 's largest warship , entered the @entity4 last night , a @entity8 spokesman said			1
although the ships did not enter @entity6 territorial waters , their movements were tracked by the @entity8 destroyer @entity17 - the duty fleet - ready escort vessel - which was dispatched from @entity20			1
@entity17 tracked and met up with a @entity2 task group off the coast of @entity27 as they entered the @entity4 yesterday watching : @entity17 , a type 45 destroyer and one of the @entity8 's most technically advanced warships , was able to pinpoint and monitor the movement of the seven - strong group as it approached the @entity6 the military manoeuvre came on the same day as president @entity34 oversaw nuclear test launches in @entity12			1
three inter-continental ballistic missiles were launched at test sites in the remote east of @entity12 , in what the military said was a test run for massive nuclear retaliation should @entity12 or its allies be attacked			2
the ships , which are currently being escorted by the @entity8 , are believed to have been returning to the @entity45 after manoeuvres in the @entity47			2
they are headed for a naval base in @entity50 in the north - west of @entity12			2
it is not unusual for @entity2 warships to pass through the @entity4 - the same group went through in the opposite direction in december			2
at no point have the ships entered the @entity6 's territorial waters - which extend 12 nautical miles from the coast of the country			0
however , according to a @entity63 treaty on sea passage , there is no reason military vessels should not be allowed through so long as they do not threaten the peace or security of a country			2
the @entity72 website - which often carries details of @entity2 naval movements - reported last month that they were due to return			0
however the latest passage took place against the backdrop of heightened tensions between the @entity80 and @entity12 over @entity81			1
a @entity8 spokesman said : ' we can confirm that @entity17 was activated as the fleet - ready escort vessel			1
she met the task group centred around the @entity10			1
' @entity17 ( background ) with the @entity2 @entity87 ' @entity88 ' @entity17 ( right ) with the @entity2 @entity89 ' ( left ) , in the @entity4 @entity90 , minister for the @entity91 , said : ' this routine action by @entity17 , in her capacity as the @entity95 , once again underlines the professionalism and credibility of the @entity8 in keeping the whole of the @entity6 secure at and from the sea			1
' captain @entity100 , commanding officer of @entity17 said : ' following our recent activation @entity17 has once more monitored a @entity2 task group through the @entity6 's areas of interest			1
this is very much routine business both for @entity17 and for the @entity8			1
' what is different here is that a @entity2 task group of this size has not passed by our shores in some time			1
cutting edge , extremely capable and very versatile , a @entity113 , such as @entity17 , is the ideal ship for the job			0
' defence secretary @entity116 said the deployment of @entity17 was part of a pre-planned operation			0
' the decision was taken about 10 days ago when we first knew of the @entity10 's planned route			2
we are notified of them in advance , ' he said at a @entity128 lunch for political journalists			0
pride of the navy : the above two photographs show former @entity2 president ( now prime minister ) @entity133 inspecting the @entity10 in 2008 once the ships spotted each other they briefly sailed close by as a standard ' meet and greet ' he said that @entity17 had taken over from a @entity139 destroyer which tracked the @entity2 flotilla through the @entity141 and would hand over to a @entity143 warship			1
while he stressed that the passage of the @entity2 ships was ' routine business ' for the @entity8 , he said there had been a resurgence of @entity2 military air activity in recent years			1
he said that was a reflection of something which a lot of people have chosen to miss , which is that @entity12 has been investing very substantially for many years in renewing its fleets , rebuilding its military capability			0
' @entity12 is a very significant military power and that is something which all too often seems to get forgotten			0
' @entity17 is the fourth of six @entity113 which have entered service over the past five years â€“ the most advanced warships the nation has ever built			0
surveillance : planes were launched by the @entity166 to determine the identity of two unknown aircraft seen approaching the @entity169 north of @entity170			0
they were identified as @entity2 @entity172 - 95s in april an @entity173 closed in on a @entity2 surveillance plane after it flew close to @entity6 airspace , before making it turn back			0
a photograph of the @entity2 @entity178 ' was taken from one of the @entity166 's @entity180 after two @entity2 planes were spotted off the coast of north - east @entity170			2
however , the aircraft turned away after the @entity6 jet fighters , one which can be seen approaching the @entity2 plane from above , took off from @entity188 airbase , near @entity189 in @entity190			0
planes were launched by the @entity166 to determine the identity of two unknown aircraft seen approaching the @entity169 north of @entity170 , which could not be identified by other means			0
the aircraft were later identified as @entity193 , which the @entity194 said remained in international airspace , as they are entitled to do			0
