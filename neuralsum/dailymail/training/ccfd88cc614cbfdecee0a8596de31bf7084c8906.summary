plans to colonise @entity1 could be dashed by simple biology			2
a series of experiments suggest that sex and reproduction are affected by changes in gravity and radiation			1
in 1979 , male and female rats were sent up into space by the @entity12 and refused to mate at all			1
however , other experiments have shown that animal sperm grow longer tails - and swim faster in zero gravity			1
plans to colonise @entity1 could be dashed by simple biology			2
a series of experiments suggest that sex and reproduction are affected by changes in gravity and radiation there are also concerns that high levels of radiation in space damage the ovaries and testicles , the @entity29 ’s annual conference in @entity30 heard			1
dr @entity31 , of the @entity32 , said these parts of the body are the most sensitive to radiation			1
the eyes are next most vulnerable – and most astronauts need glasses after returning from space			2
the @entity39 is considered to be the solar system ’s most hospitable alternative to @entity42			0
professor @entity43 has predicted people will colonise it – but not for at least a century			0
@entity47 firm @entity46 plans to establish a permanent human settlement on @entity1 , with crews of four departing on a one - way ticket every two years from 2024			2
it says that children are essential if a proper colony is to be set up – but not straight away			0
it states : ‘ in the first years , the @entity1 settlement is not a suitable place for children to live			0
the medical facilities will be limited and the group is too small			0
a pictured of the surface of @entity1 , taken by @entity60 , with the colour enhanced to show it under lighting conditions similar to those of @entity42 @entity46 's mission to the red planet ( artist 's illustration shown ) has been widely panned by experts , with many saying the @entity47 company lacks the technology or skills to have any hope of landing people on @entity1 ‘ the human ability to conceive in reduced gravity is not known , neither is there enough research on whether a foetus can grow normally under these circumstances			1
‘ in order to establish a true settlement on @entity1 , @entity46 recognises having children is vital			0
' therefore this will be an important point of research			0

in 1979 , male and female rats were sent into space by @entity12 and refused to mate at all

high levels of radiation in space could also damage ovaries and testicles
