by @entity0 @entity2 advertising campaign which tells customers to ditch their ' sensible side ' and ' treat themselves a little ' by spending on their credit card is under fire from customers			1
the bank has been sending customers handwritten , personally addressed letters from their ' sensible side ' urging them to embrace their ' impulsive side ' and get a new credit card to treat themselves to a little retail therapy			1
one letter addressed to a @entity17 teenager explicitly encourages her to apply for a new credit card because its low - cost benefits means she will be able ' enjoy some retail therapy			1
' the handwritten letter addressed to 19 - year - old @entity22 @entity24 - @entity23 said she was ' insulted ' when she received her personally letter from the @entity2 the controversial ' hand - written ' letter mailed to bank customers on the right and @entity30 's reply on the left ms @entity30 's letter detailed the very reasons why she was not suitable for the bank 's low - fee credit card and how she felt about the campaign the letters have motivated angry customers to bombard the @entity2 's @entity40 page and other websites in which they have labelled the campaign ' condescending and insulting '			1
one @entity44 father wrote to @entity45 criticising the bank for sending the letter to his 19 - year - old daughter , @entity22			0
another customer , @entity24 - @entity23 , took the time to write her own handwritten reply back to the bank , claiming the campaign makes a mockery of individual customer choices			1
ms @entity30 wrote that as a prudent money - manager and savvy investor , it was an ' insult ' to receive the letter from her bank			0
she said the letter made a mockery of her own intelligence			0
' to imply that i do not know how to manage my own finances responsibly , and then even worse , to suggest that i would consider getting a credit card to be sensible			1
how little intelligence do you think i have ? ' she wrote			0
many other customers , such as @entity69 , feel let down about the bank 's marketing strategy and the messages contained in it there 's been no shortage of negative reaction to the campaign on @entity40 one customer addressed her concern 's to the general manager of the big @entity81 financial firm a spokesman for the @entity2 said invitations to take up the credit card offer are ' only extended to customers that we expect can manage that credit			1
' ' the campaign letter is sent to existing @entity2 customers that have established a good banking history with @entity2 , ' the spokesman said			1
he said the letter used in the campaign ' highlights the smart ways to reduce credit card interest - which is usually topical at end of financial year			2
' another long - term @entity2 customer , @entity69 , 52 , who has experience in marketing , said while it might be a smart campaign it was also ' insulting , condescending and poorly targeted			2
' ' i do n't have credit card debt and i do n't have a problem with my impulsive side , ' she said			0
she said it was ' rude ' of the bank she had been trusting with her finances for more than 40 years to suggest she should rely on a new credit card			2
ms @entity69 also said there was an underlying ethical problem to the pitch because it suggested that everybody has a problem with managing their finances , even if they are debt - free			2
it is not known how many complaints have been made , but there are several other social media posts directed to the bank 's @entity40 page of people detailing their dismay			0
according to creditcard.com.au the total balance held on @entity81 credit cards with an interest - free period as of february 2014 was $ 45 billion			0
the company said this was a slight increase from the same time last year and in her letter @entity140 pointed to @entity81 's escalating credit card debt			0
' do you know how many @entity81 are weighed down with credit card debts they are unsure of ever being able to repay ? but of course you do , and that is why you are trying to milk me for all the interest you can			0
' she said she would happily ignore and decline every future credit card application the bank tried to entice her to make in the future			0
customers have hit - out at the @entity2 by saying that the campaign insults individuals money - saving habits			1

@entity2 has hit a sour note with customers over its new credit - card pitch
the bank is marketing a low - cost card it claims will manage individual *budgets*
the personally addressed letters imply customers are *incapable* of managing their finances
teenagers and loyal customers have been sent the handwritten letter
customers have fired back on @entity40 and written back to @entity2
