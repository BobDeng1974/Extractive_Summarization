by @entity0 last updated at 2:51 pm on 7th october 2011 savaged : @entity1 was killed by his uncle 's pitbull police ignored reports that illegal dogs were being bred in a house where a four - year - old boy was killed by a pitbull , a damning report has revealed			1
despite a senior housing officer telling officers that the uncle of little @entity1 was breeding illegal dogs in the same property where the youngster was mauled to death , police did nothing			1
watchdog bosses have now rapped officers from @entity20 for failing to act in the nine months before the child 's death			1
@entity1 was savaged by his uncle @entity24 's pitbull , @entity25 , while he was at his grandmother 's home in november 2009			1
the little boy suffered appalling injuries to his head and neck after being shaken like a ' rag doll ' by the dog			0
@entity34 , then aged 22 , admitted owning the animal and was jailed for four months last june			0
a report into the incident centres on officers choosing to reject an earlier report that @entity34 was nurturing illegal dogs at a house in @entity41 , @entity42 , where his mother @entity43 lived			1
the @entity44 described the force 's reaction to the initial report a ' inadequate ' , highlighting a catalogue of errors			1
key findings in the report include how : two police officers - an acting sergeant and a pc - as well as a member of the police communication staff were given ' management advice ' for the inadequate handling of the report following the inquiry			1
@entity61 , @entity44 commissioner for the north west , said : ' we will never know with any certainty what might have happened if a different decision had been taken by the officers and staff in february 2009			2
' with hindsight it is easy to say that had the police responded differently the dangerous dog may have been seized and @entity1 would not have died			1
' however hindsight is a wonderful thing			0
we can not know for certain what would have happened			0
' family tragedy : @entity1 's uncle @entity34 ( left ) and the tragic youngster 's mother @entity79 ( right ) she added : ' what is a terribly sad certainty is that in november 2009 a young , innocent boy lost his life			2
' i read the emotional tributes paid to @entity1 after his death - he was clearly a well - loved little boy			2
' he was too young to know the potential risk posed by that dog			0
the tragedy is others either were aware , or should have been aware , of the potential risk and they will have to live with that knowledge			0
' @entity20 introduced a dangerous dogs policy following the death of @entity96 in @entity97 in 2007 , which was recognised for good practice by the @entity99			2
however , failings in the @entity1 case ' undermined ' the good work achieved previously			0
illegal : pitbulls are banned under the @entity105 ms @entity106 ruled : ' an opportunity was clearly missed which may have resulted in further investigation			0
' however this was not due to malice or any deliberate act			0
rather it was poor decision making on behalf of the officers and staff involved			2
' the officers and staff - the acting sergeant , the pc who requested the log be closed and the communications room supervisor who closed the log - have been subject to action plans			2
' chief superintendent @entity126 , from @entity20 's @entity127 , said : ' following the death of @entity1 we made a voluntary referral to the @entity44 after the investigation discovered that information about potential illegal dog breeding at an address had not been dealt with adequately			1
' this information was received by a police call handler nine months before a dog owned by @entity1 's uncle and looked after by his grandmother , killed @entity1			1
' however , on this occasion appropriate action was not taken			0
all recommendations made by the @entity44 have been implemented			0

housing officer reported illegal dogs in house nine months before @entity1 was savaged
watchdog describes @entity20 's reaction as ' inadequate '
the log into the initial phone call was closed down without further investigation ;
officers discounted the *warning* call *possibly* in an *effort* to meet internal *targets* ;
' poor decisions ' were made repeatedly by staff ;
officers involved had no clear direction from police of how to report a dangerous dog , despite the @entity167 force being considered a leader in that field .
