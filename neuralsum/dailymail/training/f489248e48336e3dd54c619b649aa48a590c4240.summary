by @entity0 published : 12:30 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 04:54 est , 1 november 2012 the first reviews are in for @entity3 's £ 269 ipad mini , which goes on sale on friday - and the news is good			1
while some reviewers expressed disappointment at the relatively low resolution screen , in general the experts gave the gadget a thumbs up , and even believe it could outsell its bigger brother , the 9.7inch @entity13			2
the gadget sold out online in hours , and there are expected to be large queues for it at @entity3 stores on friday as fans vie to be among the first to own the new @entity3 gadget			1
the mini goes on sale on friday the ipad mini , which starts at £ 269 versus the £ 159 for @entity34 's @entity33 and @entity36 's @entity35 , is easy to hold with one hand , eliminating a drawback of the 10 - inch @entity13 , @entity31 columnist @entity30 wrote in one of the first major reviews of a gadget introduced last week			1
both @entity30 and @entity43 columnist @entity42 offered kudos for cramming most of its full - sized cousin 's functions onto a smaller device , as advertised			1
but the ipad mini 's 1024 x 768 resolution was a big step backwards from the @entity13 's much - touted @entity53 , and underperformed the rival kindle and @entity33 , the two reviewers agreed			1
@entity30 said @entity3 chose to go with a lower - quality display because the existing 250,000 - plus @entity13 applications could only run unmodified in two resolutions - and the higher level would have sapped too much power			1
' the lack of true hd gives the @entity62 and @entity63 hd an advantage for video fans			0
in my tests , video looked just fine , but not as good as on the regular @entity13 , ' @entity30 wrote			0
the original @entity13 was launched in 2010 and went on to upend the personal computer industry , spawning a raft of similar devices			0
the ipad mini marks @entity3 's first foray into a smaller 7 - inch segment that @entity36 's @entity75 now dominates , demonstrating demand exists for such a device			1
@entity3 , making its boldest consumer hardware move since @entity79 took the helm from late co-founder @entity81 , hopes the smaller tablet can beat back incursions onto its home turf of consumer electronics			2
reviewers get their first look at @entity3 's ipad mini ' what will make some think twice about buying an ipad mini is the price			1
starting at £ 269 for a @entity95 only model , this is £ 100 dearer than the @entity35 or the @entity33 , which is now available in a @entity97 version for £ 159			0
' whether it 's worth it depends on how much of a premium you put on great design and a vast ecosystem of apps			0
@entity3 will sell a lot of these little beauties , that 's for sure			1
' @entity108 - 4/5 ' looks are a matter of personal taste , but the ipad mini , i ’d say , is pretty spiffy			2
' where rivals are glass and ridged plastic , @entity3 ’s model is glass and aluminium ' the @entity122 ' for us , the joy of a 7 - inch tablet is walking across the office or the airport , holding the slate in one hand while tapping away at it with the other			1
' to consider it just a cheap , tiny @entity13 is a disservice			0
' this is , simply , a great tablet			0
' @entity133 " in shrinking the iconic @entity13 , @entity3 has pulled off an impressive feat , " @entity30 wrote			2
" it has managed to create a tablet that 's notably thinner and lighter than the leading small competitors with 7 - inch screens , while squeezing in a significantly roomier 7.9 - inch display			2
@entity31 ' by pricing the @entity139 so high , @entity3 allows the $ 200 class of seven - inch @entity142 tablets and readers to live			1
' but the @entity139 is a far classier , more attractive , thinner machine			0
' @entity43 ' if the @entity139 had a retina display , i ’d switch from the @entity13 3 in a heartbeat			0
' as it stands , i ’m going to switch anyway			0
going non-retina is a particularly bitter pill for me , but i like the @entity139 ’s size and weight so much that i ’m going to swallow it			0
' my guess is that this is going to play out much like the @entity155 and @entity156 back in 2004 : the full - size model will continue to sell strongly , but the @entity139 is going to become the bestselling model			0

@entity3 's latest gadget goes on sale on friday - with online orders having sold out in hours
will launch *alongside* new larger ipad with *faster* chip and new *lightning* *connector*
