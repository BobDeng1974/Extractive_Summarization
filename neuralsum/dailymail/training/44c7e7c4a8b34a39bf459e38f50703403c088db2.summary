it is said to be bottomless , but experts have managed to map @entity3 ’s deepest cave			1
intrepid explorers have charted every known twist and turn of the terrifying @entity8 cave that measures 7,208ft ( 2,197metres ) deep			1
and with every expedition the chasm seems to become deeper as divers plunge to new depths never visited by humans to extend the cave ’s reach into the @entity3			1
mapped : intrepid explorers have charted every twist and turn of the terrifying @entity8 cave that measures 7,208ft ( 2,197metres ) deep			1
the final segment was revealed by a brave diver and camps are marked on the map where explorers have rested the @entity8 cave is the deepest cave on @entity3 and is located in the @entity24 of the @entity25 in @entity26			1
it is the only cave on @entity3 deeper than 6,561ft ( 2,000metres )			2
the cave is called @entity29 in @entity30 , which means crow 's cave			2
the name was used as slang by @entity36 cavers during the 1980s because of the number of crows nesting in the entrance pit			0
the @entity24 is one of the largest high - mountain limestone karst massifs ( the main mass of an exposed structure ) in the @entity44 , which is an area of southern @entity30			2
it is composed of @entity46 and @entity47 limestones that dip continuously southwest to the @entity49 and plunge below the modern sea level			2
the @entity8 cave is located in the @entity24 on the edge of the @entity49 in @entity26 , which is a disputed territory that borders @entity53			1
it is a kaist , which means it is formed from the dissolution of soluble rock - in this case , limestone			0
it extends for 8,346miles ( 13,432km ) and since 1956 when @entity61 explorers first descended below 3,281ft ( 1km ) cavers have dreamed of exploring deeper			1
the cave is currently thought to be around the same height as six - and - a - half @entity64 stacked on top of one another			0
a map marks when explorers discovered different routes and where they camped as well as its remarkable depth			2
according to @entity75 caver @entity74 , the ‘ trail ’ is formed of a chain of pits , cascades and pitches , some of which are over 300ft ( 100 metres ) deep and connected by very narrow passages			1
one 300ft ( 100 metre ) long passage is charmingly named ‘ @entity87 ’ although for people who suffer from claustrophobia , such a narrow channel might seem more of a nightmare			0
the cave extends for 8,346miles ( 13,432km ) and since 1956 when @entity61 explorers first descended below 3,281ft ( 1km ) cavers have dreamed of exploring deeper ( pictured ) the @entity8 cave is located in the @entity24 on the edge of the @entity49 in @entity26 , which is a disputed territory that some argue belongs to @entity53 the cave , which is named after @entity30 geologist @entity8 , is the only chasm on @entity3 that 's known to be deeper than 6,561ft ( 2,000m ) the cave , which is named after the @entity30 geologist @entity8 , is the only chasm on @entity3 that is known to be deeper than 6,561ft ( 2,000 metres )			1
in 2007 , a @entity75 diver called @entity96 extended the map of the abyss by diving in ‘ the terminal sump ’			1
he increased the cave 's known depth by 150ft ( 46metres ) in 2007 and 170ft ( 52 metres ) in 2012 , @entity101 reported			0
his fearless endeavour earned him world records on both occasions			0
mr @entity74 explained in an article for @entity108 that cavers use dye traces to record where they have been and to prove the potential depth of @entity103			0
in 2005 he organised a series of expeditions and his team of 56 carried some five tonnes of equipment into the chasm			0
much like scaling a mountain , the team had to cover certain distances so they could set up camp at depth of 2,300 , 3,986 , 4,630 , and 5,380ft ( 700 , 1,215 , 1,410 , and 1,640metres )			0
the explorers were able to cook meals , sleep in tents and huddle together for warmth before venturing down the limestone rock faces for up to 20 hours at a time , sometimes though extremely cold water .			0

the @entity8 cave is located in the @entity24 on the edge of the @entity49 in @entity26 , which is a disputed territory bordering @entity53
extends for *8.346miles* ( *13.432km* ) and since 1956 when @entity61 explorers first descended below 3,281ft ( 1km ) cavers have tried to get deeper
