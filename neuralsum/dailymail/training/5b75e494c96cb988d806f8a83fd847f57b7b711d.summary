published : 05:48 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 10:55 est , 24 october 2012 the director of @entity3 's @entity2 exploration programme says he hopes that one day the rover curiosity might be brought back to @entity5 by astronauts			1
@entity7 said it was his personal hope that humans would visit the @entity2 in the 2030s or 2040s			1
he said he could imagine astronauts walking up to @entity4			1
the @entity3 chief set out his vision during a satellite link up with @entity20 in the @entity21 at the weekend			2
the community of about 280 people has twinned itself with a site on @entity2 that @entity3 has labelled @entity20 - 35 million miles away			1
@entity7 said : ' it is my hope that humans will be sent to @entity2 in the 2030s , or 2040s , and they will be able to walk up to @entity4 and bring it back , as i am sure there is a museum out there that would love to have it			1
' plutonium generators that deliver heat and electricity to @entity4 could continue working long after the rover completes its mission			2
but @entity7 said wear and tear of working parts were likely to bring an end to @entity4 's life before the generators			1
a meteorite strike - the @entity2 is scarred with thousands of such impacts - is another possible threat to the rover			2
@entity7 said : ' if we put humans on @entity2 they are going to have to watch for those meteorites			2
' a panoramic image from @entity4 - could astronauts be walking in the area by 2030 ? retired astronaut @entity56 , a veteran of five space shuttle flights , also told the event in @entity20 of her desire to see humans on @entity2			1
she said : ' it is not a question of if , but when and who			0
' attending the twinning ceremony in person , @entity65 said it was important future generations took an interest in science and maths			0
@entity73 was key to her career as an engineer working on space shuttles , and later as an astronaut flying in them			0
@entity65 was also keen to debunk suggestions the @entity80 was faked			0
she said : ' at @entity3 i worked with @entity83 , an astronaut who walked on the @entity84			0
' @entity65 added : ' i grew up watching @entity85 , which were popular at the time of the landing			0
in those shows who can see the wires holding up the spaceships			0
' the former astronaut said wires can not be seen in the @entity80 and the special effects were not available 43 years ago to fake the footage			0
the latest pictures from @entity4 show a sample of @entity2 soil on the rover 's observation tray			1

director of @entity3 's @entity2 exploration programme *believes* missions could see humans on the @entity2 by 2030
hopes astronauts could return @entity4 to a museum on @entity5
