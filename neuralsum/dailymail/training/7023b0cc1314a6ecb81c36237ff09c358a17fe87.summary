the script in @entity2 ’s head prior to qualifying surely placed him on pole position , his esteem restored , on the testing ground of true racers at @entity8			1
but in the slipping , sliding wet of this saturday afternoon it was his @entity11 team - mate @entity9 wearing the broad smile of the fastest man			1
@entity2 , who was two - tenths of a second behind after struggling with a brake problem , was gloomy in his immediate press dealings			1
he will start today ’s @entity18 from second on the grid – a handy place to be , according to history			2
only six of the last 14 pole - sitters have converted their advantage into victory			2
@entity2 himself was overtaken at the start when on pole here last year			1
yes , @entity9 is clever and thoughtful , a percentage player , but he is not meant to be @entity2 ’s equal , let alone better , over a flying lap on a proper track like this – at 4.3 miles the longest in @entity50 and home to such legendary corners as @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
nor is this a one off			0
@entity9 has now taken seven poles this season compared to @entity2 ’s four			1
some of the @entity60 ’s disappointments were the result of ill - luck – notably , a fireball at @entity64 last time out and brake failure a week earlier in @entity67			2
despite @entity11 being exceptionally fast , he has not been on pole since the @entity69 @entity18 in mid-may			2
he complained afterwards of a ‘ glazed ’ front left brake destabilising the car			0
‘ this is a circuit where you have to have confidence in the brakes , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ you could see when i was going straight on as the left brake was n’t working for some reason			0
i do n’t know why			0
‘ it went into glazing			0
when it glazes it is very hard to recover			0
you have to put the brake balance forward			0
it ’s not that easy to clear it			0
’ it takes a good rub to fix the problem			0
that will be done overnight , meaning his brakes should work perfectly when the lights go out today			0
‘ i am not disappointed , ’ said @entity2 , contrarily given his miserable body language and flat tone			2
but remembering how @entity31 breezed past him on the straight last season , he added : ‘ second place is the best place to start here so i feel quite blessed			1
’ @entity2 is right not to think his chances of victory are over , given the @entity101 acts he has performed on a number of recent sundays from way down the field			1
as @entity9 said : ‘ in the end i was really feeling comfortable and able to push , but it is only qualifying , so there is still a long race to go			1
‘ this is one of the most special tracks of the year , so to be in front is great			0
’ second : whilst his @entity11 team - mate @entity2 will start the race in second edged out : it means the @entity116 will have it all to do at @entity8 on sunday the conditions were typical of @entity8 , a place for which the word ‘ capricious ’ could have been invented			1
rain , sun , cloud , cold , warmth all blew in and out as the afternoon progressed			0
about 40 minutes before qualifying started the heaviest of the rain started , trapping team principals in the @entity11 motorhome , where they had met for private talks			1
@entity131 team principal @entity130 was the first to brave the conditions , without an umbrella			0
he ’s from @entity134 and has seen worse			0
others cowered in the doorway			0
the track was still wet when the cars started , and rain fell again just after the first session had finished			0
by then , @entity2 had delivered one tetchy exchange over the radio			2
urged to keep pushing – what else would he be doing ? – he snapped back : ‘ please do n’t speak to me on my lap. ’ he only had to push against one man , in fact , such was the total dominance of the @entity148 : @entity31 , of @entity149 , and @entity150 , of @entity151 , were third and fourth fastest yet more than two seconds behind @entity9			1
the other brits had disappointing days			0
@entity153 , so often a master in tricky conditions , was only 10th quickest , three places behind his @entity158 team - mate @entity157 , while @entity159 was 19th , more than a second a half behind the other @entity131 of @entity161			1
third : whilst @entity149 driver @entity31 will start off from third on the grid as for tomorrow ’s race , the two @entity11 men will be allowed to race free of team orders			1
that is the commitment made to them after the confusion of the @entity169 @entity18 four weeks ago , when @entity2 was asked to let @entity9 through but did not ( there were extenuating circumstances )			1
@entity172 , @entity11 ’ executive director , admitted the situation had needed ‘ mediating , management , caressing and hard words ’			2
should @entity2 lose out today , and slip further than 11 points behind @entity9 , there may well need for more of the same .			1

@entity9 beats team - mate @entity2 into second in qualifying at @entity8
@entity11 *duo* in a class of their own , two seconds clear of rest of the field
@entity31 will start third whilst @entity150 is fourth on grid
qualifying at @entity8 hit by torrential rain and hail stones
