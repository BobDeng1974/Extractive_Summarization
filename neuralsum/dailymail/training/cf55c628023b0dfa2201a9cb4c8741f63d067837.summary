by @entity0 published : 20:17 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 20:18 est , 31 january 2013 after the affair : actress @entity2 was pictured outside a cafe 20 years after her affair with @entity6 minister @entity4 made tabloid headlines there she sits , fag in hand , hair cascading over her shoulders , woolly coat wrapped around her body to keep off the chill			1
on a winter ’s day , @entity2 is having lunch outside a tapas restaurant in @entity19			1
she is ready for her next beer , if not her close - up			1
@entity2 looks pretty darn good for a 51 - year - old smoker			1
she still has that lovely skin and the pale , @entity26 face			0
she still looks in great shape , which is more than you could ever say about @entity4			1
still , can it really be 20 years since she was a femme fatale , to put it politely , who famously romped with goofy @entity32 when he was a @entity6 minister in the @entity34 government ? have two whole decades really passed since the unlikely couple were making whoopee together ? of course , that was before @entity2 burst their lurvve bubble and became the most famous kiss - and - tell merchant of her day			1
their torrid cavortings were splashed all over the newspapers and tv screens for weeks afterwards			0
toe - sucking , spanking , skipping about in a @entity47 football strip ? oh , excellency , you knew how to spoil us with ministerial affairs back then			1
following her revelations , there was the never - to - be - forgotten spectacle of @entity4 parading his wife and children behind a garden gate , like targets on a fairground stall			1
all in a desperate , doomed attempt to prove his family life was intact			2
he was just as shameless as she was			0
eventually , @entity4 left the government and his wife			1
meanwhile , @entity67 tried and failed to cash in on her notoriety			0
she took part in a documentary about mistresses ; she briefly became the agony aunt of @entity76 magazine			0
however , the public — unlike @entity4 — remained resistant to her charms			1
especially when , after ten years , she admitted the saucier details about their affair were untrue			2
how unforgiveable ! @entity4 recently complained her allegation that he insisted on wearing a @entity47 strip when making love would follow him to his grave			1
pass me a hankie , darlings			0
that ’s enough to bring a tear to a glass eye			2
where did all this get @entity2 ? she apparently imported textiles and jewellery from @entity95 and @entity96 for a while			1
at some point , her brief marriage also failed			0
today , she lives in a one - bedroom flat in a down - at - heel area of @entity19 and exhibits few signs of a woman who has made a great triumph of her life			2
cashing in : @entity2 became the most famous kiss - and - tell merchant of her day the lover : @entity4 , pictured on the night he quit as heritage secretary in 1992 , following a number of scandals , including his affair with miss @entity2 in contrast , look at @entity4 , who exudes the sleek , satisfied air of the rich and successful international businessman he is			1
he lives with his glamorous partner , @entity116 , @entity117			0
he has shaken free from his former shame , like a dog wriggling off the raindrops following a storm			0
all things considered , @entity2 seems to have fared less well			1
and that is my point			0
in the world of kiss and tell , short - term gain is always followed by long - term decline			2
the women almost always come off worse than men , many of whom seem to ultimately survive the bombshell of their indiscretion and go on to thrive , like cockroaches			0
sorry : escort @entity138 says she is full of regret about her torrid past for the kissers and tellers , however , there is only the initial , exciting firework explosion of notoriety and fame			1
closely followed by nothing but ashes			0
perhaps all this will be noted by @entity138 , the escort girl who made public her affair with married footballer @entity151			1
this week she made a tv apology to his wife @entity153			0
the 23 - year - old said she wanted to apologise about the @entity159 and @entity158 star ’s infidelity with her while she was a £ 1,300 - a - night call girl			1
she only embarked on this career , she says , because she was a teenage rebel			0
it was only later that it ‘ become an addiction ’			1
ms @entity138 has given up being an escort , become a mother and says she is full of regret about her torrid past			1
asked what she would like to say to mrs @entity168 , she replied simply : ‘ i ’m sorry			1
’ hmmmm ! is she really ? if she was truly contrite , would n’t she want to spare mrs @entity168 further embarrassment ? would n’t she have the good grace to crawl under the nearest luxury rock , instead of rubbing @entity153 ’s nose in the scandal on a daytime tv show watched by millions ? it is hard to imagine @entity138 ’s mischievous apology brought any comfort for mrs @entity168			1
let ’s face it , she ’s not mortified or humbled — she is utterly brazen			2
@entity138 is only on the telly to promote herself and to try to rehabilitate her reputation			1
for she is working on a book about her life , no doubt with lots of tell - all sauce about her links to @entity189 stars			2
that ’s how truly sorry she is			2
and while she might be the centre of attention now , all she has to do is look at @entity2 to see what the future holds			1
not much glamour there ! twenty years from now , @entity138 will understand the pattern			1
be they footballers or politicians , powerful men will survive the attentions of their mistresses or consorts , and go on to prosper			0
while it is unlikely the indiscreet mistress will come out of it well			1
the woman almost never does			0
this week , sir @entity209 said that if he had a torch , he would pass it to professor @entity211			0
the legendary broadcaster has no plans to retire , but suggested that @entity211 should take over fronting the @entity215 ’s natural history programmes when he does			2
noooooo ! @entity211 , who has become a household name following the success of his @entity221 series @entity219 , is hugely popular			2
he is the man credited with making physics sexy — that ’s if you like your quantum theories delivered by someone with a choirboy haircut and a perma - smirk			1
is he really a worthy successor to peerless @entity209 ? enthusiasm is n’t everything			2
plus the prof is always slightly too pleased with himself for comfort			0
and anyone who is never off tv , who made a guest appearance on stage with @entity242 , and who still likes to complain about the downside of fame does not my vote get			0
not something sir @entity247 would have ever done			0
every blade of grass may have 3.8 billion years of history written into it — but it is still humble			2
she 's already got the @entity255 and @entity256 gong , and she ’s probably going to get the @entity257 , too , closely followed by a lovely , piping hot @entity258			2
is it going to be a straight flush of @entity261 supporting actress gongs for @entity263 ( above ) for her role as fantine in @entity265 ? get your hankies at the ready , for i think it has to be a yes			0
how can she fail ? winner : actress @entity263 has already won a @entity255 and a @entity273 and is hotly - tipped to take home a @entity257 and an @entity258 @entity263 with the quivering , @entity276 eyes plays a good girl forced into prostitution to care for her illegitimate child			1
she has to go on a starvation diet , get all her hair cut off , swop her prim needlewoman ’s dress for a tart ’s rags , be ravished by an army captain , get her teeth pulled out , give it the big boo hoo when she sings @entity291 ( think of @entity292 crying at the @entity293 , multiply it by ten and you are almost halfway there ) , die , get resurrected as a ghost and do all of this in about 15 minutes of screen time			1
give that woman a medal as well as a gong			0
actor @entity304 is the latest celebrity to reveal himself on @entity305			0
reveal himself as a not very nice person , that is			0
@entity304 — perhaps most famous for playing mr @entity309 the valet in @entity311 — made several barbed remarks on @entity305 about former prime minister , @entity313			0
as a way of establishing yourself as a political thinker , that ’s on a par with spray - painting a peace sign on a wall			1
i mean , grow up , @entity304			0
no wonder that on reading his remarks , @entity324 consultant @entity323 tweeted him to suggest the comments were beneath him			0
the star replied by telling her to ‘ go f * * * yourself ’			1
oaf ! @entity304 is the kind of @entity305 celebrity who only wants followers to agree with his every tiny , gorgeous thought			0
he will brook no dissent			0
look , if he ca n’t cope with the modern world of communications , he should go back to brushing dandruff off @entity342 ’s shoulders			1
@entity343 , get him ! @entity344 is being bitchy again , claiming @entity346 ‘ looks like a newscaster ’ with her new fringe and hairstyle			1
now just hold it right there , @entity351			0
i wo n’t have a word said against @entity354 ( that ’s the first lady of the @entity356 , for those who never watched @entity358 )			1
@entity360 villain look : @entity344 has criticised @entity346 for her new fringe haircut especially not by some desiccated ogre in leather glovettes and a peroxide comb - over			2
what is the @entity367 boss like ? if he was a @entity360 villain , @entity344 would be too far - fetched			2
as the @entity368 , he ’s more believable			2
he ’s not just ghastly			2
he ’s not just wrong			1
he is out of touch with ordinary women who like and admire @entity346 for all the right reasons			0
what is going on ? i read that when appearing on an @entity356 chat show this week , @entity376 ( right ) ‘ easily passed for a woman much younger than 43 ’			1
oy ! there are millions of us out here who do n’t think 43 is particularly old			0
who would actually love to be 43 again			0
and not just around the hips			0
meanwhile , @entity383 complains that because she has long hair at the age of 45 , her granny thinks she is a slut			0
yes , the @entity388 are a very confusing time .			0

can it be 20 years since @entity2 famously romped with goofy @entity4 ?
she looks pretty darn good for a 51 - year - old smoker
escort girl @entity138 should learn - the indiscreet mistress is never likely to come out well
@entity398 believes *higher* benefits wo n’t solve child *poverty* . let ’s hope his findings wo n’t be howled down by partisan politics , but i ’m not holding my *breath* . some are *accusing* him of *waging* war on the poor . they can do nothing wrong ; he can do nothing right . and in the meantime , we ca n’t move forward .
@entity415 has been the stealth comedy success of the century . critics hate it , *audiences* love it . over @entity422 , it beat @entity423 and everything else . it is *filthy* , foul - mouthed and features a man in a dress saying ‘ feck ’ an awful lot . it ’s like a panto put on by a mad family who live at the end of the street . and it ’s *hilarious* .
