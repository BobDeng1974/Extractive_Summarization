a ship found off the coast of @entity2 could be a pirate vessel that sank more than 350 years ago			1
shipwreck hunter @entity4 believes the 80ft craft belonged to legendary privateer @entity6 , known as the pirate king of scilly			1
the @entity6 was originally a 44 - gun @entity10 frigate but its swashbuckling skipper captain @entity6 became a privateer just before the start of the civil war in 1643			1
discovery : @entity18 holds one of the artefacts he found on what he believes is a 17th century pirate ship he ran aground his ship , the @entity6 , in 1645 , after it was damaged in a battle with sailors sent by @entity28 since then , its exact location has remained a mystery			1
he joined a fleet of smaller vessels based on the @entity32 which raided ships in the @entity34 and seized them and their cargoes			0
captain @entity6 was a staunch @entity37 and his predations may have enjoyed semi official approval from @entity28 , whose coffers would have been boosted by his loot			1
he spent two years as a pirate until he was tracked down by three parliamentary warships in 1645 and his ship was mauled in a naval battle close to the @entity32			1
deep blue sea : @entity4 dives in what is believed to be the @entity6 's remains , 44 gun frigate belonging to @entity6 he then grounded it on a reef and escaped onto the islands along with most of his crew but the location of the wreck has remained a mystery which has baffled naval historians for years			2
captain @entity6 himself returned to the mainland where he was taken back into the mainstream @entity60 , knighted , and promoted to vice admiral			1
he carried on fighting until the end of the @entity64 in 1649 when he fled to @entity65			0
diver @entity4 is convinced that a large wreck he has located near the @entity32 is the @entity6			2
artefacts recovered from the sea bed date it to the @entity64 period			0
the wreck is 80 foot long and too large to be one of the many small traders which foundered on the @entity75 at the time or one of the lesser pirate ships in the ten - strong fleet			0
experts are due to dive on the wreck in the next few weeks and it could receive protected status as an important underwater historical site if the identity is confirmed			0
mr @entity4 has found a treasure trove of artefacts , including a thin silver coin imprinted during the reign of @entity28 he said the story of the @entity6 and its colourful captain read like the script of a @entity94 blockbuster			1
‘ it ’s like a movie - @entity6 was n’t even 50 when he died , but he lived an amazing life , any part of which would make a great film , but looked at together is almost unreal , ’ he said			0
describing the find , mr @entity4 added : ‘ i followed the lines in the sand and found there was more and more			0
artefacts : @entity4 examines some of the evidence which he claims shows that the shipwreck off the @entity2 coast is the missing 17th century pirate ship skippered by legendary seaman @entity6 ‘ i was fighting the tide , but i could dig in with my hands to hold on			1
‘ i could tell it was a very big vessel , had been armed and from the construction technique that it was pre- 1750			0
‘ but i could also tell it had been run aground because the bow was pointing into the land			2
’ mr @entity4 said : ‘ there was already a rag tag bunch of pirates at @entity32 , but @entity6 and his huge ship , the @entity6 , became the flagship , and all the pirates rallied under his banner			2
‘ there were about 11 ships in all , pillaging other ships , kidnapping people and conducting raids			0
‘ the @entity129 was petitioned about him and wrote to his father , the @entity130			0
‘ @entity131 was under pressure to act and in 1645 sent in the three ships to @entity32 to stop this pirate			2
’ in the aftermath of the pitched battle , the damaged @entity6 was run aground by her captain , who then fled to @entity139			1
ironically , it seemed crime did pay for captain @entity6 , whose support for the @entity130 won him a knighthood , a promotion to vice-admiral and the command of another ship			1
hidden treasure : mr @entity4 reads the historical records detailing how the @entity6 sank in 1645 after it was damaged in battle he then returned to @entity32 and , mr @entity4 claims ‘ carried on where he left off ’ up until the execution of @entity28 in 1649 , when he escaped to @entity65			1
@entity155 , maritime archaeologist with the organisation , said it could end up being @entity159 ’s newest protected shipwreck site			0
she said : ‘ it is of interest because it is a very early vessel			0
‘ we know the @entity6 was a @entity37 vessel and we know it was lost in 1645			2
‘ this is a preliminary investigation , but it could turn out to be of huge historical significance			0
