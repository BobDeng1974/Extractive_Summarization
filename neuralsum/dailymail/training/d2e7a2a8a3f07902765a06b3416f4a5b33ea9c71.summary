@entity18 : @entity0 threatening the rural @entity20 town of @entity10 has stopped its slow , forward advance for now , @entity6 officials said thursday dormant : while the lava has not moved since last thursday , it could start up in the coming days , officials said aerial : lava from the @entity26 flows across the ground on november 3 , 2014 in @entity10 , @entity2 destructive : molten rock from the flow is inching its way towards homes in the town of @entity10 on @entity2 's @entity2 where close to a thousand people live long trail : the @entity37 volcano has been active since a fissure eruption on in january 1983			1
it attracts tourists who travel to @entity2 to watch red hot glowing lava flow into the @entity42 residents in the @entity2 's @entity45 district have had weeks to prepare for the slow - moving lava from @entity26			1
on october 26 , the flow crossed a country street on the edge of @entity10			1
since then , it 's smothered part of a cemetery and burned down a garden shed			2
the lava also has also burned tires , some metal materials and vegetation			2
on monday president @entity59 declared the lava flow to be a natural disaster , @entity58 reported			1
the declaration frees up federal money to help protect local communities in @entity10 and the district of @entity45 from the lava flow , which began moving toward homes on june 27			1
@entity10 residents have had weeks to prepare for what 's been described as a slow - motion disaster			1
most have either already left or are prepared to go			0
at least 50 or 60 structures — including homes and businesses — are in an area civil defense officials are currently warning will likely be hit			0
@entity76 , who has farm in a part of @entity45 that is not immediately threatened , described smelling burning grass , feeling warmth from the lava and hearing ' popping and sizzling and all the methane bursts that are happening in the distance ... mixed with the birds chirping and the coqui frogs			1
' the @entity88 family decided to move to @entity89 , a safe distance from @entity26 's current flow			1
' we did n't want to go anywhere where it 's close enough where we would have to evacuate again , ' she said			2

then there 's the prospect of subsequent flows gradually swallowing more of the community , which is what happened to the @entity128 and @entity129 subdivisions in the 1980s and 1990s			2
' it 's so surreal , it 's so surreal			0
never in my wildest dreams as a kid growing up did i think i would be running from lava , ' said @entity135			0
some people want to watch the lava destroy their homes as it 's one way to cope with the loss			2
' you can only imagine the frustration as well as ... despair they 're going through , ' said @entity2 civil defense director @entity144			2
@entity76 watched last week as the lava crept toward @entity10 and saw a woman whose house is near its path put a lei at the front of the flow			1
' it helps a person come to grips with the reality of the situation , ' he said			0
' i found it to be oddly comforting in a really strange way			0
' @entity159 , who runs @entity160 with her husband , said the lava flow , while unnerving , has a cleansing quality to it because it keeps development on the lush @entity20 island in check			0
' if it was n't for the flow , i would n't be able to live here , ' she said			0
' this land would have been a golf course for the rich			0
' @entity174 scientists began warning the public about the lava on aug. 22			2
at the time , residents were cleaning up from a tropical storm that made landfall over the @entity45 district , toppling trees and knocking out electricity			1
the lava has advanced and slowed as residents waited and watched			0
@entity26 , one of the world 's most active , has been erupting continuously since 1983			1
this is not an eruption at the caldera , the things that make for stunning pictures as red lava spews from the mountaintop			0
decomposition of vegetation in the lava 's path has created methane gas , which if it accumulates and is ignited by heat can cause a blast , @entity195 said			1
' it 's not a massive explosion , ' she said			0
' but it can dislodge rocks			0
it can hurl large rocks several feet			0
' who is at risk ? initially , the lava seemed headed for the @entity211 , a widespread , sparsely populated subdivision in the @entity45 district			1
it reached vacant lots in the subdivision before it stalled			0
it skirted the northeast corner of the subdivision and then headed toward @entity10			2
@entity218 has small - town , quaint and historic charm , but it 's ' the only town in a commercial sense in lower @entity45 , ' said state sen. @entity223 , who represents @entity45 and runs a natural food store in @entity10			1
because the lava could change direction , any community in @entity45 is at risk			1
everyone in the district lives on the volcano			0
the lush , agricultural district is about a 30 - minute drive from the coastal town of @entity121			0
the lava that crossed @entity236 is on the other end of the street from the @entity240 home , but they 're bracing for the possibility the lava will spread or change directions			0
country - style living why would someone live on an active volcano ? unlike @entity249 , the state 's biggest city on the island of @entity252 , the @entity2 's @entity45 region has affordable land and offers a more rural way of life			1
located on the island 's southeast side , the area is made up of subdivisions that have unpaved roads of volcanic rock			2
many live off the grid on solar power and catchment water systems			0
residents know the risks as there are special insurance requirements to buy land in certain lava zones			0
preparations sporadic suspensions in the lava 's movement gave emergency crews time to work on building alternate routes to town in the event the flow covers the main road and highway			1
crews near the leading edge have been wrapping power poles with concrete rings as a layer of protection from lava heat			0
officials worried that if lava crosses @entity293 130 , it would isolate @entity45 from the rest of the island			1
' @entity45 will be divided into the north side of the flow and the south side of the flow , ' @entity223 said			2
@entity300 said they began putting their belongings in storage in september			2
what they are n't able to take with them , they 're photographing for insurance purposes			0
@entity309 ? no one knows if the lava flow will stop , change direction or hit homes			0
in the 1990s , about 200 homes were destroyed by lava flows from @entity26			1
the last evacuations from the volcano came in 2011			0
one home was destroyed and others were threatened before the lava changed course			0
cultural significance @entity26 is home to @entity322 , the @entity20 volcano goddess			2
some residents expressed anger at suggestions to divert the flow			0
they say it 's culturally insensitive to interfere with @entity322 's will			0
@entity329 the @entity114 says @entity26 is the youngest volcano on @entity2			1
officials estimate @entity26 's first eruption happened between 300,000 and 600,000 years ago			1
do n't cancel vacation plans the lava is n't a reason to cancel a @entity2 vacation because it 's an isolated event			1
officials have warned people to stay away from the area and imposed flight restrictions because of helicopter tours hoping to see lava .			0
