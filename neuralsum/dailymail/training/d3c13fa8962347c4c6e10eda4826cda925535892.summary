programmes such as @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 have reversed a ‘ long term decline ’ in the relationship between the @entity6 and the @entity7 , says the corporation ’s director of england			1
but it is perhaps unsurprising @entity11 should make these comments , given that his wife @entity13 is the star of both shows			1
@entity11 , who is in charge of the @entity6 ’s @entity17 base , has revealed figures showing that ‘ for the first time in living memory ’ people in the @entity7 feel better represented than those in the rest of the @entity21			1
but numbers released today show the balance has shifted to 6.31 for the north of @entity28 and 6.29 for the rest of the @entity21			2
the highest score was given to northwest viewers with 6.48			2
speaking at a @entity44 event in @entity45 , @entity11 , who earns a salary of £ 375,000 said : ‘ when we did the big change and the big switch , we said this has got to transform the experience of licence fee payers right across the region			1
‘ so in the last two or three years we ’ve halved the gap in consumption between the @entity7 and the rest of the @entity21			0
it used to be 4 percent because the @entity6 has been traditionally more southern centric broadcaster in terms of consumption			1
@entity61 were the kings and queens outside @entity45 but in recent years we ’ve reversed that			0
‘ if we look at things like portrayal approval and things like that , do the people think the @entity6 reflects their lives , we now see for the first time in living memory people in the north of @entity28 feeling on a par to the rest of the @entity21 , if not slightly better represented ’			1
he put this down to the increase in programmes both set and produced in the region , such as drama @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 , both set in @entity82 , and inspector @entity83 , set in @entity84 and @entity85			0
a number of formerly @entity45 - based departments , such as sport and children ’s programming , moved to @entity17 three years ago and tent - pole shows such as @entity92 and @entity93 are also now produced there			1
he said that shows such as @entity2 in @entity3 , pictured , helped reverse the @entity6 's decline in the north @entity11 believes this has thawed even the frostiest of the @entity6 ’s regional relationships			1
he said : ‘ in the @entity101 of @entity28 , which has always been one of the most chilly places for the @entity6 , it ’s quite remote from @entity45 based organisations typically , we ’ve really begun to reverse years of having a negative relationship either with the power structure in the @entity101 or audiences			1
we ’ve done it simply by making a lot more programmes in the @entity111			0
’ @entity1 is a crime drama following the @entity82 police sergeant @entity113 , played by @entity13 , trying to come to terms with the suicide of her daughter			1
she becomes obsessed with the man who she believes raped her daughter and drove her to suicide			0
it transpires that the man is also involved in a kidnapping plot			0
earlier this year @entity1 prompted criticism for showing ‘ gratuitous ’ violence in a string of graphic scenes			2
the lead character - police sergeant @entity113 , played by @entity13 - was savagely beaten in a basement during one episode			1
as the show ended , she collapsed in the road , her face covered in blood , leaving viewers guessing whether she had died			0
the scenes prompted 15 complaints from viewers			0
it followed a harrowing incident previously in which another policewoman was murdered on a lonely country road			0
an average of 5.8million viewers tuned in to @entity1 ’s first four instalments , and most praise its gripping plot and realistic police procedure			0
but some have expressed concern at its increasingly gruesome twists and graphic depictions of violence against women			0
@entity2 in @entity3 is a romantic comedy series also starring @entity157 and @entity158			0
@entity159 ( @entity157 ) and @entity160 ( @entity161 ) are both widowed and in their 70s			0
when their grandsons put them on @entity167 , they rediscover their feelings for one another are as intense as they were 60 years ago when they were teenagers			0
@entity13 plays @entity158 ’s daughter @entity170 in the series			1
mr @entity11 ’s relationship with his common law wife collapsed in 2000 and it emerged that he and miss @entity174 were an item several months later			1
mr @entity11 the former controller of @entity178 , left the mother of his three sons , @entity181 , after falling for the former @entity183 star			2
mr @entity11 and miss @entity174 got to know each other when he worked at @entity185 in @entity186			2
they have a son together and live in @entity189 , south - west @entity45 .			2

the £ 375,000 - a - year *executive* said the @entity6 had been southern - @entity195
he said new shows featuring *northerners* were helping the @entity6 *re-balance*
