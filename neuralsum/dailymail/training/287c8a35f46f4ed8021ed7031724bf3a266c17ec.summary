by @entity0 @entity2 ' ears ' have been installed along one of @entity6 's most landslide prone train lines , in a @entity7 first			1
bosses are hoping the newly installed fibre - optic cables will protect rail tracks , passengers and roads across the country			1
the pioneering project is being tested on the route below @entity16 , where in 2010 a @entity18 train nearly plunged down a 50ft embankment after hitting a fallen boulder			1
it involves cables being buried just below the surface on either side of the single - track line for six miles between near @entity26 and @entity28 stations			1
the ' ears ' are set to be trialled on the line that saw the @entity26 derailment back in 2010 derailed : the accident was caused when a train hit a boulder on the track network @entity6 said the ' distributed acoustic sensing ' ( @entity38 ) scheme can warn of trees falling on tracks , and landslides on roads			1
and the system is sensitive enough to distinguish between obstacles falling and on the line and other noises such as trains , deers and hailstones			2
@entity50 , director of route asset management said : ' rockfalls and landslips are one of the railway 's longest standing risks and we are always looking at ways we can use technology			0
' the new acoustic monitoring technology on trial offers us a potential solution to a problem which has affected the @entity65 lines since they were built by the @entity66			0
' if successful , this new system will help us provide an even safer and more reliable railway on a line vital to both local communities it serves and to @entity6 's tourist trade			2
' they are a modern - day replacement for a @entity76 rockfall warning system in the steep - sided pass of @entity78 on the @entity80 line			2
a tripwire system built by engineer @entity82 in 1882 , in which falling rocks trigger line - slide signals , failed to detect the boulder which derailed a train in 2010			1
in 2012 , a @entity18 train hit debris from a nearby landslide , one of two incidents in @entity6 the same day			0
three weeks prior to that , a freight locomotive crashed down a hillside near @entity96 in the @entity65 after hitting landslide debris			0
hopeful : bosses are hoping the newly installed fibre - optic cables will protect rail tracks , passengers and roads across the country painful memory : it is hoped the technology can bring even more piece of mind to commuters a @entity18 spokeswoman said : ' we are aware @entity113 has begun trials of a new acoustic system			1
' we welcome this initiative as , if successful , it will aid in the delivery of a more reliable , consistent and safe railway			0
' the @entity119 has previously instructed @entity113 to improve its assessment of landslide risks to speed up its response to incidents			0
a spokesman for the watchdog said : ' the regulator supports @entity113 's work to develop , and introduce , new technology for monitoring the condition of its infrastructure			0
' that is why we approved Â£ 95 million for the implementation of remote condition testing for earthworks , signalling equipment , level crossings and other assets over the next five years			0
' @entity113 @entity6 hopes the new technology will offer a cheaper alternative to maintaining the tripwire system and other anti-landslide measures such as netting slopes and removing rocks , which often require line closures .			2

' ears ' on the track will give passengers *greater* piece of mind
have been installed on the line below @entity16 - scene of a 2010 derailment
nobody died , but eight *people* were *hospitalised*
