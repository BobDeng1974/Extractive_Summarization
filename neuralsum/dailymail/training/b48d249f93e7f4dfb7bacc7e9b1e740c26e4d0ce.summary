by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 09:35 est , 21 august 2013 a toddler had to have part of his body built from scratch when he was born , due to a rare condition			1
@entity6 , now 16 - months - old , had an entire part of his digestive system missing so just hours into his life he underwent major surgery , which saw doctors build him a replica duodenum			1
the condition , which affects 1 in 50,000 births in the @entity15 , occurs when there is a build up of amniotic fluid in the womb , causing an absence of the vital organ and a ‘ double - bubble ’ becomes visible on diagnostic x-rays of the abdomen			1
happy families : @entity6 , now 16 - months old with proud parents @entity0 and @entity27			1
the rare condition affects 1 in 50,000 births in the @entity15 his mother @entity29 had to have eight litres of fluid drained from her baby bump before she could give birth to him - enough to fill four large coca - cola bottles			1
@entity0 , 27 , said : ' i first knew there was something wrong because of the size of my bump , which appeared really quickly			2
' @entity6 was my first baby but i ’d seen other pregnant women , including my sister , and i was much bigger			2
' i am naturally tall and skinny , but it looked like i had a basketball shoved up my top			0
' while doctors were not initially concerned , they soon became bothered 32 - weeks into @entity0 ’s pregnancy , when they noticed she had an excessive amount of amniotic fluid in her womb			1
an ultrasound confirmed that her baby had ‘ double bubble ’ which occurred as @entity6 ’s stomach was not attached to his bowel			2
the increase in fluid meant he could not swallow all of the fluid while in the womb and absorbed it into his digestive tract			1
doctors whisked baby @entity6 into life - saving surgery hours after birth			1
without the operation , he would have slowly starved to death when @entity0 and her fiance @entity27 , from @entity69 , @entity70 , were told of their unborn baby ’s condition , they were given the option , almost seven months into the pregnancy , to abort it			2
@entity0 said : ' i was speechless and in complete shock			2
until now , everything had seemed completely normal			0
' but there was no way we were going to get rid of him			0
we were so excited to meet him and we would n’t have given him up for anything			0
' the only way doctors could allow @entity6 to be born was to drain the excess fluid from her stomach , using a huge needle , which was inserted into her stomach			1
eight litres was siphoned from @entity0 ’s stomach before medics confirmed it was safe for @entity6 to be born at 38 weeks - just a fortnight before his due date			1
after a caesarean section at @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity6 was born last april , and immediately whisked away to the nearby @entity101 for constructive surgery on his abdomen			1
he required a duodenum , the first section of the small intestine , which is crucial for digestion			0
without the operation , he would have been unable to digest any food and if the condition had not been discovered , he would have slowly starved to death			0
@entity27 , 27 , a buyer for a pharmaceutical company , said : ' they basically open him up and start plumbing			0
' they built a pipe and fed it into his digestive system to sit between his small intestine and his bowel			0
the condition - which is caused by a build - up of amniotic fluid - can be detected by a diagnostic x-ray			1
eight litres of fluid were drained from @entity0 's womb before it was safe to deliver @entity6 at 38 weeks for new - mum @entity127 , she did n’t see her son for days , and was simply given a number of photos and a breast pump while @entity6 underwent life - saving surgery			1
' ' it was devastating not being able to see him , ' she said			0
' i ’d undergone surgery myself having a caesarean so i could n’t get out of bed and go and see him			0
' ' when i did see him , he had all these tubes coming out of him			0
as a first - time mum , it was very scary			2
' after a fortnight , @entity0 and @entity27 were able to bring @entity6 home for the first time and the youngster is now a happy and healthy little boy			1
@entity0 added : ' we were at the hospital everyday with him for two weeks			2
to see each tube come out and notice a bit more development was amazing			0
' the doctors were impressed that i still wanted to breast feed			0
i watched the milk go through his tubes and i think it helped him to get better			0
' he ’s our happy , smiling , bouncing baby boy now , and we ’re so proud of everything he ’s been through in his short life			0
