a brazen new online black market where users can buy drugs , forgeries and hacking services has broken cover to advertise itself in a @entity7 clip			1
looking like an advert for a well - funded @entity12 start - up , the slick promo video for @entity9 boasts that it is ' the world 's best anonymous online drug marketplace ' it comes as the site 's backers announced the launch of a ' big social media campaign ' that seems intended to make a play for the market share of the better - known @entity23			1
dangerous drugs : a screengrab of of the @entity27 online marketplace shows some of the illegal drugs on offer , including heroin , cannabis , @entity32 and @entity33 the products categories listed on @entity9 , which include drugs , drug paraphernalia , forgeries and money , leave little doubt that laws are being broken			1
some of the products on sale include ecstasy pills , @entity32 crystals , speed , cannabis , lsd , heroin and a range of designer compounds , all available for mail order as if they were bought on @entity51			0
elsewhere services including @entity54 account hacking and free access to @entity56 , as well as tools that might be useful to criminals , are on offer			0
users pay using the anonymous online currency @entity62 , or its new competitor @entity64 , heavily encrypted payment services which disguise the parties in transactions			1
in an illicit online world that has hitherto been dominated by one site - @entity27 's decision to advertise may be a desperate move to take a bigger grab of existing market share			1
@entity23 , in operation since 2011 , remains by far the biggest illicit internet bazaar , with one researcher estimating that it attracts 60,000 unique visitors a day and a recent study estimating annual sales worth $ 22million ( Â£ 14.5million ) , @entity74 reported			1
like @entity23 , @entity9 is only accessible through the @entity82 , an anonymising service which purports to foil attempts to track internet users ' online activities			1
@entity82 , whose name is short for @entity82 , bounces web traffic around a worldwide network of nodes - dubbed onion routes - adding layers of encryption to make users untraceable			1
the system works both ways , and while users can use @entity82 to anonymously browse mainstream websites , they can also exploit it to anonymous post websites without revealing their physical location			2
this anonymity has allowed for an explosion of criminality online , with users swapping child porn , selling drugs or advertising illegal services - earning it the nickname of the ' dark net '			2
@entity23 , despite a string of newspaper exposes in recent months , has at least made an effort to be more discreet , not actively advertising its website address , for example			2
instead , those curious must find someone to tell them the website address or otherwise find it by browsing elsewhere on the so - called ' dark net '			0
the new advert for @entity9 , which is almost certainly against @entity7 's terms of service , asks viewers to ' meet @entity122 ' , a ' stoner ' who has moved cities for work and has since been unable to find any ' dank buds '			1
' he did n't think he 'd ever find weed again , until he found @entity9 , ' it says			2
the story ends with @entity122 getting ' high as a damn kite ' thanks to the purchase he made through the site			0
it concludes : ' so now that big problem @entity122 had has completely gone away ! ' a person claiming to the the online bazaar 's ceo recently told @entity142 users on an ' ask me anything ' thread : ' we want to bring attention to the site and bring our vendors more buyers			1
he said he was n't concerned that drawing attention to the site might attract any unwanted attention from police			0
' law enforcement is going to be aware of us ( and probably already is ) regardless of the way we choose to put our product out there , ' he said			0
although @entity9 is set up to facilitate transactions involving a string of dangerous drugs and illegal services , its ceo , whose @entity142 account has since been deleted , says there are limits to what is acceptable on the site			1
' we do not allow listings such as child pornography and necrophilia , ' he said			0
' we do take a moral stance , there 's a large difference between child pornography and drugs			0
' he added : ' restricted items include anything related to paedophilia , poisons , loans , investment opportunities , assassination services or anything which can inflict harm on another person			0
' if you infringe on these rules we will terminate your account instantly			0
' from the responses he gives to various questions on the @entity195 , it is clear that the ceo , whoever he is , believes there is little chance authorities can act against @entity9			2
' we have team members in various different countries , ' he said			0
' i would say physical location is relatively irrelevant			0
' we can access our systems from anywhere , and our location and the server location is protected by the @entity82 hidden service network			2
