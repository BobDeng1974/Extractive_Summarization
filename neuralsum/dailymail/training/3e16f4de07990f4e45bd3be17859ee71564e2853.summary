telling results : @entity1 is running a ' government of chums ' where ' who you know ' matters more than ' what you know ' @entity1 is running a ‘ government of chums ’ where ‘ who you know ’ matters more than ‘ what you know ’ – and he is becoming dangerously out of touch with voters as a result			1
that is the finding of a new poll in the wake of the longest run of political and public - relations blunders by the @entity22 , many self - inflicted , since mr @entity1 became prime minister			2
the hostile reaction to the ‘ granny tax , ’ the ‘ pasty tax , ’ the petrol panic and the @entity26 ‘ donorgate ’ scandal appears to have led to a growing feeling that mr @entity1 and his ministers are elitist and remote			1
the phrase ‘ a government of chums ’ was first coined in a leader column in @entity36 last week , which asserted that ‘ a small group of people from very similar backgrounds , who have known each other for years , are running the country mainly by talking to each other – and to nobody else ’			0
the idea was then taken up by former @entity47 cabinet minister @entity46 in @entity48 the following day			0
now , a poll by @entity50 for @entity36 provides convincing evidence that the public concurs			0
more than six out of ten say mr @entity1 heads a ‘ government of chums ’ – fewer than one in seven disagree			1
nearly two out of three say entry to mr @entity1 ’s elite inner circle depends on ‘ who you know ’ against just one in five who say ‘ what you know ’ matters more			1
perhaps the most damning verdict came when voters were shown two photographs of mr @entity1 – one in his @entity69 @entity68 days and a more recent one showing him dressed in jeans drinking a pint of beer in a pub – and then asked to identify the ‘ real @entity1 ’			1
the @entity68 emerged as the ‘ real @entity1 ’ by a margin of 63 per cent to 37 per cent			2
nearly three - quarters of the population view the conservatives as ‘ out of touch ’ and 61 per cent say the @entity47 leader is ‘ more style than substance ’			0
the rest of the @entity83 fares little better when it comes to sharing the pain of the recession			0
nearly seven out of ten say that ministers are not personally committed to their ‘ we ’re all in it together ’ slogan			2
competiton : three out of ten pin the same ‘ snob ’ label on @entity92 , left			1
yet the ratings of the prime minister ’s fellow @entity95 , right , show that it is possible to have a privileged background and still be popular four out of ten say mr @entity1 is a ‘ snob ’ and he polled a lowly average of 13 per cent for being ‘ in touch ’ , ‘ caring ’ , charismatic ’ , ‘ sincere ’ and ‘ trustworthy ’ , while nearly one in four said he was ‘ competent ’			1
three out of ten pin the same ‘ snob ’ label on @entity92			1
a dismal one in 25 say the chancellor is ‘ caring ’			0
yet the ratings of the prime minister ’s fellow @entity95 show that it is possible to have a privileged background and still be popular			1
when asked who they would invite to dinner , the public put mr @entity95 way ahead with 22 per cent , followed by mr @entity1 on eight per cent			1
unpopular : only one in ten regard state school - educated @entity112 , left , as a snob , yet a mere five per cent would want to sit next to him at dinner , making him a less popular guest than @entity119 mp @entity118 , right only one in ten regard state school - educated @entity112 as a snob , yet a mere five per cent would want to sit next to him at dinner , making him a less popular guest than @entity119 mp @entity118			2
similarly , @entity124 mayor mr @entity95 is seen as ‘ most in touch ’ by 14 per cent , followed by mr @entity112 on ten , shadow chancellor @entity126 on nine and mr @entity1 on eight			1
but the poll shows the @entity129 backlash is fading , with @entity131 ’s lead down to five points from its eight - point margin two weeks ago			0
@entity131 now stands at 35 and the @entity22 30			0
deputy prime minister @entity135 ’s woes grow as anti-eu party @entity136 has caught up with his @entity137 on 11 per cent			0
mr @entity1 will be relieved that despite the @entity129 backlash , he still beats mr @entity112 on economic trust by 34 per cent to 26			2
and mr @entity112 ’s lack of flair remains a fatal flaw : only one in 33 say he has charisma , against 17 per cent for mr @entity1			2
mr @entity92 has edged back in front of shadow chancellor @entity126 on economic trust			0
however , @entity147 ’ ‘ man of the people ’ image appears to have helped him achieve a notable victory when voters were asked who would get the best bargain at a car boot sale			0
more than one in four chose mr @entity126 , with 13 per cent for mr @entity92 ; @entity112 nine ; mr @entity1 eight and mr @entity135 seven			1
@entity50 interviewed 1,039 people online on thursday and friday .			0

nearly two out of three say entry to mr @entity1 ’s elite inner circle depends on ‘ who you know ’
three out of ten said @entity92 was a ' snob '
ratings of @entity95 show that it is possible to have a privileged background and still be popular
