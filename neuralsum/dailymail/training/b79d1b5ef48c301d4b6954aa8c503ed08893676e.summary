' a defense official said the four bombers also were supported by two il - 78 aerial refueling tankers that were used for mid-air refueling during the operation this week			2

other versions are equipped with intelligence - gathering sensors and electronic warfare gear			0
it has a range of around 9,400 miles without refueling			0
@entity43 said the aircraft ' acted professionally ' and the bombers appeared to be conducting a training mission			0
' they typically do long range aviation training in the summer and it is not unusual for them to be more active during this time , ' he said			0
' we assess this was part of training			0
and they did not enter territorial airspace			0
' a @entity10 @entity26 @entity55 aircraft executing a supersonic flyby the bomber incursion is the latest @entity4 nuclear saber - rattling amid stepped up tensions over @entity83 's military annexation of @entity85 's @entity84			1
@entity88 @entity87 @entity86 , a member of the @entity89 , called the @entity4 flights ' intentional provocations ' , the @entity45 reported			0
' @entity92 is doing this specifically to try to taunt the @entity10 and exercise , at least in the reported world , some sort of saber - rattling , muscle - flexing kind of nonsense			1
truth of the matter is we would have squashed either one of those [ bombers ] like baby seals			0
' ' it 's a provocation and it 's unnecessary			0
but it fits in with [ @entity92 's ] macho kind of saber - rattling , ' he said , adding that he expects @entity4 will carry out more of these kinds of incidents in the future			0
the @entity12 is the fastest propeller - driven airplane ever built			1
it was originally designed to carry two nuclear bombs to targets in the continental @entity10 later versions carried cruise missiles for long - range stand - off missions			1
@entity122 has also been used for reconnaissance , especially by the @entity125 / @entity124 which used the aircraft to locate @entity10 aircraft carrier task forces			1
last month , in a maneuver straight out of the @entity131 , a @entity4 fighter jet purposely flew 100 - feet in front of the nose of an @entity10 spy plane in april , @entity10 officials confirmed on monday			1
the fly - by over the @entity135 between @entity4 and @entity136 was described by one @entity10 official as ' straight out of a movie '			2
the same @entity10 official said the @entity4 jet put the lives of the @entity10 @entity26 @entity141 in danger and called it ' one of the most dangerous close passes in decades			2
' it is the latest source of concern for @entity10 officials since a heightening of @entity10 - @entity4 tensions following @entity83 's intervention in @entity85			1
in mid-april a @entity4 su - 24 fighter made low - level passes over a @entity23 ship in the @entity153			0

their crews are from the @entity163 and the @entity164 of the @entity165			0
the ' @entity155 ' aircraft are equipped with communications gear designed to locate and identify foreign military radar signals on land , at sea and in the air			2
