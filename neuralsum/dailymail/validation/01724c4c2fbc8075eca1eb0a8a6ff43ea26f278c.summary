@entity1 's kitchen counter admission that he will not run for a third term as prime minister has raised more questions than answers			1
but before we get to the nitty gritty of who will take over in 2020 - should mr @entity1 be re-elected in may - there is a far more pressing question to answer : is his kitchen better than those of his political competitors ? @entity14 was the first to welcome cameras into his kitchen , and since then @entity17 and the @entity3 have both invited tv crews to snoop around the pantries of power			1
scroll down to vote in our poll @entity1 's kitchen at his @entity24 home is bright and airy , with plenty of room to prepare meals @entity14 's ' functional kitchenette ' seems dingy and less homely in comparison to the prime minister 's equipped with a hob , two ovens and a sink , the @entity14 's second kitchen is said to be where they make ' tea and quick snacks ' @entity14 , posing for a cup of tea with his wife @entity40 , lived to regret his photoshoot after it emerged that it was taken in the smaller of his two kitchens			1
the @entity45 leader insisted he preferred his ' functional kitchenette ' - complete with a hob , two ovens and a sink - while a family friend revealed it was mainly used for ' tea and quick snacks '			1
the bland room , painted white with a grey floor , seems cold and rather dingy compared to the kitchens at the prime minister 's two homes			0
while many were listening intently to mr @entity1 's revelation that he will not run for @entity59 's highest office come 2020 , others were busy taking note of his family - sized kitchen at his @entity24 home			1
his practical kitchen includes a large worktop , which the prime minister used to chop up vegetables with @entity69 deputy political editor @entity68 , as well as mod cons such as a blender and an ice - dispensing fridge - freezer			0
showing the @entity78 leader 's sense of humour , some viewers of his bombshell interview may have spotted a red ' @entity81 ' chopping board on the windowsill - a reference to when he landed himself in hot water by using the remark on @entity45 's @entity86 in the @entity87			0
@entity1 was pictured cutting up tomatoes in his kitchen , while another red chopping board with the phrase ' @entity81 ' can just about be seen in the windowsill the prime minister was also seen in his smart kitchen chopping tomatoes while chatting to @entity69 deputy political editor @entity68 the @entity97 ' @entity96 kitchen is fully - stocked with food - as well as at least two bottles of wine which party leader has the best kitchen ? which party leader has the best kitchen ? now share your opinion the @entity97 ' kitchen in @entity96 was also fully - stocked when cameras were allowed in earlier this month , with wine bottles visible in the fridge and on the kitchen counter , next to a loaf of bread			1
even @entity17 , leader of the @entity112 , has had tv crews inside her house			2
@entity115 remarked that the first minister 's spotless house looked like a ' show home ' as she sipped on a brew fresh from ms @entity17 's coffee machine			1
@entity121 told her : ' we are in your lovely home now ... it 's immaculate			0
' ms @entity17 replied : ' that 's because i had my husband up most of last night cleaning it			0
it 's not always this tidy			0
' in one recent interview @entity1 was seen preparing dinner , but the best ms @entity17 could do was make a coffee			2
' i 've never been very good in the kitchen , ' she admitted			0
' i like @entity138 takeaway , ' she said , before joking : ' the fact we are on first names terms with the person who delivers it on a friday night should n't allow you to read anything into my lifestyle			0
' posing in jeans , @entity17 admitted she has never been any good in the kitchen as she made a coffee the @entity112 leader invited @entity115 into her house near @entity152 so she could have a poke around			2

@entity1 is the latest politician to let the tv cameras into his kitchen
he was interviewed in his @entity24 home 's open - plan dining area
the *pm* 's bright kitchen made for a stark comparison to @entity14 's
his second kitchen - a ' functional kitchenette ' - appears dark and dingy
@entity17 's kitchen was *yesterday* described as ' immaculate '
