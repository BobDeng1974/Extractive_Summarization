guidelines from scientists advising @entity13 , the agency given the job of tackling obesity , yesterday stated that women should have no more than five to six teaspoons of sugar a day , and men seven to eight			1
a 330ml can of fizzy drink contains around seven teaspoonfuls , so would meet this limit on its own			2

senior doctors and academics want the government to force food manufacturers to cut sugar levels , ensure products are clearly labelled and impose a tax on soft drinks			1
but @entity13 merely said it would ‘ consider ’ these ideas as part of a nine - month consultation process that will eventually report to ministers next spring			1
@entity13 simply issued a document suggesting a number of ideas the government could consider to help the public meet these targets			1

other plans include discouraging supersize portions at coffee chains , fast food outlets and cinemas			0
but ministers last night remained non-committal and said the @entity13 document would help ‘ inform ’ the debate about sugar			1
