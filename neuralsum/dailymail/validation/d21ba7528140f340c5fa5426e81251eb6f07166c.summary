@entity0 wants to fight @entity1 within the next year , paving the way for a spectacular return to @entity4 for @entity6 boxing			1
as recently as monday @entity0 was talking down the chances of a grudge match between himself and @entity6 ’s other leading welterweight , who has spent years calling out @entity0			2
but now there appears to be a genuine chance of this fight happening , with @entity0 saying on tuesday that a meeting is inevitable , either at the end of this year or in 2016			1
after @entity1 's victory over @entity16 on saturday , he called out @entity0 in a post-match interview @entity1 demolished @entity16 in @entity18 , beating him in just four rounds to retain his @entity22 @entity21 title the bargaining tool of @entity1 ’s @entity22 world title remains a draw for the @entity27 fighter , but a major factor has been the public pressure , which has grown enormously since @entity1 demolished his mandatory challenger @entity16 on saturday			1
with that in mind , it remains to be seen how much of what @entity0 is saying is lip service			0
certainly , @entity1 ’s team are waiting for formal talks to start before they get excited about a fight they have long craved and which would surely match @entity41 ’s 2014 rematch with @entity42 at @entity4			0
@entity0 said : ‘ i ’d love to go in the ring and fight @entity1			1
it will happen within the next 12 months but i have already given my word to an opponent and i want to be a man of my word			2
‘ after watching his ( @entity1 ’s ) last performance , i know i can do a deal , winner takes all			0
it shows it is not about the money , it is about the pride			0
it could be his last fight , i would give him that much of a beating			0
’ brook , pictured celebrating his win over @entity16 on saturday , appears to have got his wish to fight @entity0 @entity0 's last fight came against @entity62 in december , whom he beat to take his record to 30 - 3 @entity0 has previously refused a fight with @entity1 , but now promises it will take place within 12 months he added : ‘ it ’s all about timing : if i ’ve got a different route and i want to face the likes of the ( @entity72 ) @entity71 and ( @entity74 ) @entity73 out there , then @entity1 will have to wait			1
’ @entity0 also tweeted : ' they doing a very good job making the public believe i do n't want the fight , trust me i do ! keep building the hype cause winner takes all ! ' any plans promoter @entity82 had of staging the fight on june 13 - he has a provisional booking with @entity4 - are scuppered by @entity0 ’s claim to have promised a fight to a different opponent			1
he is expected to announce his next fight this week			0
@entity89 understands @entity0 would have made £ 4.5million from a june date with @entity1 , but with the rivalry likely to rumble loudly into 2016 he could take up to £ 5m			2
@entity1 ’s camp are in talks with @entity95 legend @entity94 over a summer fight , while @entity98 regular champion @entity97 and @entity99 are also possibilities .			0
