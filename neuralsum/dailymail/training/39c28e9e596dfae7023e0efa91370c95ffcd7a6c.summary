it was revealed that a virus forced @entity2 to miss his last three weeks of training , but it was the fans who caught a bad cold on a fog - shrouded saturday night in @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
@entity2 climbed from his sickbed in time to reduce @entity11 ’s face to something out of pulp fiction with his telescopic jab and thereby move into line to challenge dominant world heavyweight @entity16 next year			1
when , and if , that happens it will be a sight worth seeing			0
so hopefully it will take place before thousands of those watching have left			1
those without cars faced a choice : make a dash for the last train back to town before the main event even started , or stay in their seats to get their money ’s worth before emerging into the dank and the dark to join long queues for infrequent night buses or wander deserted byways hoping to hitch a lift			2
they could walk for hours to the nearest quarter of the @entity62 where taxis might still have been operating			0
@entity65 choices for ticket buyers			0
especially those in stiletto heels and micro dresses			0
these over- running shows are becoming as epidemic as flu in winter			0
last weekend in @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 lumbered on until after midnight			0
@entity2 and @entity11 were supposed to be in the ring by 11pm but did not touch gloves until 12.40am			1
@entity11 stumbles forward as he struggled to get any purchase on his punches while @entity2 throws out his jab those in the sell - out crowd of 15,700 who were anxious to catch that last train just about made it by scarpering the moment the judges of the preceding bout awarded their split decision to @entity89 over @entity90			1
at least they had seen the fight of the night			2
but no - one is more conscious than promoter @entity94 that they will think twice about going next time if tarrying until the climax means you can not get home before dawn			2
having lived up to his promise of a good night ’s sport , he departed vowing to ‘ put a curfew on the finishing time in future ’			0
some will be saying that those who missed @entity106 with his switch - hitting jabs until he resembled a gargoyle were the lucky ones			2
@entity21 , the gypsy giant ’s trainer and uncle , let us in on the secret of his nephew ’s pre-fight ailment , saying : ‘ @entity2 was weakened but would not pull out			1
’ from the first bell , @entity2 was on top with @entity11 failing to land a decisive blow over the 10 rounds that reinforced their decision to minimise risk , especially with a prize as rich as a mandatory position as @entity16 ’s challenger at stake			1
@entity21 praised his young nephew for ‘ having the maturity to be patient against a man who will always be dangerous if you give him the chance ’			1
some of those still in attendance grew restless as @entity2 used his 6ft 9in height to lean back out of @entity11 ’s range and his long reach to gradually disfigure his opponent ’s features			1
it was not a performance to cause @entity16 any loss of sleep as the rest of us trudged home but it forced the stoppage of a hard man who was in better shape than when he took @entity2 the distance in their first fight three years ago			1
with @entity11 ’s eyes swollen to near - closing point his corner convened a medical consultation at the end of the 10th			1
@entity94 instructed them to pull him out			0
@entity2 , in a southpaw stance , shows his height and reach advantage which allowed him to dominate all night @entity11 has his eye checked after being forced to take some heavy punishment from @entity2 's jab @entity11 had not won a round and @entity94 said : ‘ no boxer likes to be retired			1
@entity167 of all in a fight this important			2
but by then he had no chance of winning and there was no point him taking further punishment			0
’ the boos had been growing louder but @entity21 said : ‘ some people with a lot of booze only want a slug-fest			1
we are interested in bringing the world heavyweight title back to @entity183 and @entity2 will do that			1
he has phenomenal talent and until now we ’ve only been scratching the surface			0
he ’ll be ready for @entity16 next year			0
’ @entity94 said : ‘ that will be a huge stadium fight and we ’ll do all we can to get it over here			2
’ that will have to wait until @entity16 is given his chance to add the only world title missing from his collection , the @entity188 belt soon to be contested by @entity193 and @entity194			0
the fight is waved off after @entity11 's trainer @entity196 told his man that he wanted him to go out on his feet fury is congratulated by his wife @entity201 after conserving his unbeaten record with victory over @entity11 fury locks lips with @entity201 and has barely a scratch on his face after the one - sided showing in @entity7 @entity16 is expected to meet the winner in the spring , while @entity2 will keep busy against a top - 15 opponent on @entity94 ’s february 28 promotion at @entity7 ’s @entity211			1
assuming there are no nasty surprises , the @entity214 and the @entity215 should meet next august or september			0
@entity89 opened the door to his own world middleweight title shot by surviving a gladiator comeback by the powerful son of a fabled father			0
@entity221 stood erect and absorbed while @entity222 failed to win any of the first six rounds as the experience and technical skills of @entity89 taught him a lesson			2
but the lad is a quick learner			0
he turned it into a rough - house in the second half of the fight , clawed back some of the deficit and forced @entity89 to dig deep to survive a storming finish			1
@entity2 claimed the @entity236 and vacant @entity183 belt to set up a challenge against @entity16 ( above ) it ended with @entity239 still 117 - 112 behind on my card but the judges called a close split decision			1
this came a fight or two too early for @entity239 but stars can be born in thrilling defeats and by the time this rivalry blossoms into a rematch , the outcome could be different			2
but that is on hold while @entity89 chases his dream			0
@entity2 has long hoped to become the first member of the travelling community to win a world title but @entity89 may beat him to it			1
@entity89 is now the mandatory challenger for the winner of next month ’s fight for the @entity261 middleweight belt between @entity262 and @entity264 ’s @entity263			2
@entity265 should get his shot in march or april and again @entity94 will strive to bring his man home advantage — but before the witching hour , if you please			0
by the time i had finished working and negotiated a plague of roadworks , i was opening my front door in @entity7 at a quarter - to - four in the morning			0
but then i am paid to do this , not forking out hard - earned cash for the very dubious privilege of being stranded in the dead of night .			0
