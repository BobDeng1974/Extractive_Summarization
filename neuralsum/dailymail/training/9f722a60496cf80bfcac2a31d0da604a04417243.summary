they are the prodigies , the rising stars of the global game			1
flourishing for club and country , these teenagers are hoping to make their breakthrough on the world stage - and soon			1
with the international week in full swing , we take a look at 10 of the most exciting players on the planet under the age of 20 and what they 've achieved in their careers so far			0
@entity16 ( 18 , @entity17 under 20 and @entity18 ) do n't be fooled by the funny name , @entity16 - or @entity16 - is one of the hottest properties in @entity17			1
the striker was part of the incredibly talented under 20 squad that went goal crazy in winning the @entity26 in the summer and has long been admired by many of the @entity29 heavyweights			0
now 18 , he has been involved in the @entity17 set - up for five years and first made headlines when he scored 10 goals in seven matches at the @entity34			1
his subsequent move from @entity36 to @entity18 caused controversy as it is generally agreed that players under the age of 17 are not hawked around by agents			2
mosquito celebrates his goal for @entity17 against @entity43 at the @entity44 last year the forward has proved himself a deadly finisher and is expected to ultimately make the move to @entity29 @entity48 ( 18 , @entity49 and @entity50 ) tipped as the ' next big player ' to come out of @entity52 , @entity48 has already enjoyed some big moments in his career for club and country			1
the @entity58 hotshot was very impressive on @entity50 's pre-season tour of the @entity60 , even scoring in the 4 - 1 win over @entity62 , having won a place on the flight to @entity65 by impressing during a training camp for the fringe players in @entity68			1
he has certainly caught the eye of @entity70 , who said : ' @entity71 is an exciting player			0
i love the way he plays and i feel that he will have a good career at the club and go on to become one of the players of the future			0
' internationally , he was the star of @entity49 's triumph at the 2013 @entity44 , scoring six goals and contributing seven assists as they lifted the trophy in the @entity84			2
@entity48 in action for @entity49 against @entity86 at the @entity44 last year @entity87 ( 19 , @entity88 and @entity89 , on loan from @entity91 ) part of the @entity95 under 21 squad that will take on @entity96 for a place in next summer 's @entity98 over the coming weekend , forward - thinking midfielder @entity92 stands out even in such a prodigiously talented group			1
currently on loan at @entity89 - where he has scored once in three matches so far - from parent club @entity91 , he is tipped for a very bright future			2
two - footed with exceptional passing and vision , @entity92 has already featured in the @entity18 first team and was a member of the @entity95 squad that won the 2012 @entity109			1
@entity87 ( right ) , who is on loan at @entity89 from @entity91 , in action against @entity112 @entity113 ( 18 , @entity114 under 19 and @entity115 ) known as the next @entity116			1
or is it @entity118 ? or perhaps @entity119 ? whatever the comparison , @entity113 is well on his way to fulfilling his huge potential for both club and country			1
at the start of last season it was obvious the forward had outgrown the youth team at @entity115 and so , at the age of just 17 years , four months and 25 days - a club record - he lined up for the first team in a @entity134 tie with @entity135			1
he has since appeared regularly for @entity115 , scoring four times			2
@entity113 is also just the latest off the @entity138 production line as they try to retain their @entity44 crown four years from now in @entity43			1
he has been a regular scorer at every age level so far , notably the @entity142 , where he got 16 in 18 matches			0
@entity113 playing for @entity114 in an under 19 international with @entity144 last month @entity145 ( 19 , @entity146 and @entity147 ) very talented right winger who has been the subject of enquiries from @entity50 and @entity151 , on the recommendation of @entity153 , no less			1
the 19 - year - old winger wo n't be coming to @entity29 just yet , however , having only recently signed for @entity155 club @entity147 from @entity156 in his @entity158 homeland			1
@entity145 is just 5ft 6.5in but makes up for his slight build with abundant skill and speed			0
he was part of the @entity156 squad that won the 2013 @entity158 championship and has represented his country at @entity167 and @entity168 20 levels			0
@entity145 receives the ball during an @entity171 vs @entity173 match at the 2011 @entity65 @entity174 @entity175 ( right ) in action for former club @entity156 in the @entity177 @entity178 ( 19 , @entity179 under 21 and @entity180 ) called up to the @entity179 senior squad last october - in place of @entity183 no less - fleet - footed winger @entity178 was being touted as a wildcard for @entity186 's squad at the @entity44			2
but then disaster struck and the @entity180 man suffered a serious knee injury that not only ended his season but also any hope of being on the plane to @entity17			2
it was particularly ill - timed as @entity178 was also starting to make an impression for his club after joining from @entity196 the previous summer			2
no matter , the 19 - year - old is back to full fitness and has plenty of time to fulfil his obvious potential			1
@entity178 reacts after hitting the crossbar in @entity179 's match with @entity206 at the @entity207 @entity178 ( right ) uses his acceleration to get clear of @entity210 's @entity209 at the under 20 @entity44 @entity211 ( 19 , @entity212 under 21 and @entity213 ) part of the @entity212 under 21 squad that will play @entity216 in the @entity98 play - offs this week , left back @entity218 seems destined for the big time			1
the @entity213 talent has long been linked with a move to one of @entity224 football 's leading lights , such as @entity225 or @entity226			0
he has come through the ranks at his hometown club and made his first - team debut back in december 2011			2
@entity231 is equally as capable with his defensive duties as with pushing forward as a flying wing back			0
has just this year been promoted to the @entity212 under 21 squad			0
@entity235 in training for @entity212 ahead of an under 21 match earlier this year @entity231 in the colours of club @entity213 flying down the wing in a @entity241 encounter with @entity242 @entity243 ( 19 , @entity168 21 and @entity244 ) it 's a testament to @entity243 's abilities that he has 74 appearances for @entity244 under his belt and is still only 19			1
he is deployed by the @entity250 side to perform both defensive and offensive duties and is very capable of doing both			0
the left - footed teenager is a fine passer of the ball and packs a powerful shot too			0
@entity243 came through the youth ranks at the @entity259 side and made his debut in january 2012			1
his feats for the @entity144 have been equally impressive , helping the under 17 team to victory in the 2011 and 2012 @entity264			2
@entity144 's @entity243 in action during an under 21 qualifying match with @entity267 back in june @entity268 ( 18 , @entity269 and @entity270 on loan from @entity272 ) still only 18 , @entity268 already holds a few significant records - he became @entity275 's youngest goalscorer at 16 years and 98 days when he found the net for @entity272 against @entity277 on the opening day of the 2012 - 2013 season			1
the striker is also @entity269 's youngest ever scorer after breaking the record of @entity282 on his debut against @entity284 in october 2012			0
and he was an unused sub in his country 's @entity44 squad over the summer			0
comparisons with the great man have become part of the burden @entity268 must bear and it does n't help that he was spotted when at @entity282 's football academy back home			2
it now remains to be seen how his career develops - @entity268 is currently on loan with @entity270 havign spent a bit of time in @entity300 with @entity301 last season			0
the game time can surely only help this big talent			0
@entity269 star @entity268 showing off his trickery in training during the @entity44 in @entity17 @entity307 ( 19 , @entity308 under 20 and @entity309 ) usually , @entity65 stars flourish at a club in their homeland before taking the well - trodden route to @entity29 for a megabucks sum			1
not so @entity307 , whose family moved from @entity316 to @entity317 when he was just five			0
consequently , his talent has been nurtured in the @entity60 and , more specifically , by @entity319 club @entity309 , whom he joined at the age of 14			0
indeed , he was the first academy player the @entity309 brought through when contracted in november 2010			0
attacking midfielder @entity307 has an effective combination of acceleration , control and instinctive finishing that make him highly effective			0
@entity327 hotshot @entity307 playing for @entity309 in an @entity319 match with @entity329 @entity330 5 goals from the @entity332 this week			0
