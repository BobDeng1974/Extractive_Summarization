husband and wife @entity3 and @entity5 have just tied the knot - in the world 's first jet pack wedding in the grandest of entrances the couple flew in to their ceremony each wearing a $ 100,000 ( Â£ 63,000 ) @entity14 water - powered jet pack system			1
landing on @entity16 , @entity17 , they greeted their amazed wedding guests			2
' as you can imagine , to do something like this you 'd have to be			2
' to keep with tradition as closely as possible , mrs @entity35 , 26 , a sales assistant , wore white board shorts with a white veil and a surfing rash vest			0
she landed on the beach next to father @entity45 who walked her down the aisle before giving her away			0
. wet wedding ! wearing a white veil and white surfing top , mrs @entity35 makes a similarly spectacular landing on her jet pack to begin the service mrs @entity35 gets to grips with the adrenaline - inducing machine as she prepares for her rather unorthodox jet pack wedding wedding vows : the couple zoom across the bay using the water - powered jet packs , with the groom flying higher than the bride who prefers to skim across the surface of the water @entity65 mr @entity3 wore a black wetsuit complete with a bow tie			1
the whacky service took place at the seaside location yesterday afternoon			0
after exchanging vows the newlyweds performed an airborne first dance - above the water - to @entity76 's ' @entity75 '			1
the daring couple , from @entity78 , @entity79 , became engaged on an adventure holiday to @entity81 in april			0
their trip had been organised by adventure travel company @entity84			0
mad marriage : the couple hold hands as a registrar conducts the service , wearing a pair of equally extravagant green glasses fit for the occasion you may kiss the bride : after all the splashing around in the sea , the couple get to the highlight of the ceremony and seal the ceremony with a kiss the wedding picture : most people are surrounded by the ornate architecture of a church , but @entity3 and mrs @entity35 's wedding picture will be that of sea and wetsuits still time for tradition : the now mrs @entity35 throws her bouquet to relatives watching the service audience : friends and relatives - some of whom were concerned about the extreme wedding - look on teary - eyed as the couple are married wedding dance : the couple have the equivalent of a jet pack dance on the water , to the sound of @entity76 's @entity75 and it was 25 - year - old hotel manager mr @entity3 's choice of t - shirt - one bearing a @entity84 logo during his proposal to his beloved partner - that opened the door to their bizarre service this week			1
he had enlisted a stranger to photograph his proposal on the @entity81 shoreline and later sent his picture to the adventure company to say thanks for providing the perfect setting			0
the company later approached the pair and offered them the chance to wed by jet pack			1
@entity148 's offer was eventually was accepted - but not before some cautious words from mr @entity3 's new in - laws - parents @entity45 and @entity151			1
beaming bride : mrs @entity35 is all smiles at the wedding			0
her white surfing vest provided an alternative to a flowing white dress mrs @entity35 poses with her mother @entity151 who was initially quite reluctant for her daughter to be married wearing a jet pack , but came round to the idea after being assured it was safe together : the couple stroll along the beach , with the groom in his black wetsuit and white bow tie ' they were kind of quiet , ' said mrs @entity35			1
' they were curious if it was safe			0
' she added : ' they 're not ultra conservative , but they just did n't want to miss out on any of the traditions that as parents i 'm sure they were looking forward to once i was engaged			0
' the @entity14 retails at an introductory price of $ 99,500 , according to @entity14 's website			2
the jet pack ostensibly straps to the user , and is connected by a 30 - foot hose to a boat unit that feeds water to power the device .			1
