by @entity1 reporter published : 07:22 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 11:35 est , 14 september 2012 @entity3 council chiefs have banned a bow tie - wearing duck from collecting cash for charity - unless it gets a permit			1
the bird - called @entity8 - wears a dickie bow and waddles alongside his owner @entity10 raising money for sick youngsters			1
@entity8 and @entity14 regularly visit businesses collecting cash from the public - already raising £ 6,500 for a children ’s hospice			1
@entity18 hearted : @entity10 and @entity8 ( pictured together ) have collected thousands of pounds for charity as a popular double act on the streets of @entity22 but mr @entity10 has now been told by several councils that his sidekick could be deemed ' irritating ' and needs a permit			1
mr @entity10 , of @entity26 , @entity22 , now has to apply 28 days in advance for a single day ’s permit - meaning he would only be allowed to collect on one day each month			1
he said : ' if i was putting into my own pocket , i could understand it , but everything goes to the sick children			2
' if a permit covered me for a year and i was able to visit a different town each day , that would be fine , but on this basis i do n’t think i can carry on			0
' mr @entity10 and @entity8 collect on average £ 200 a day by going into businesses around @entity39 and @entity22			1
partnership : mr @entity10 ( pictured left ) fears he and @entity8 ( pictured left and right ) could be restricted to collecting just one day a month under the terms of the permit @entity8 dons a bow tie and @entity14 carries a bucket and together the pair have raised £ 6,500 for @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity22			1
but council officials say to be fair to all charities , they must limit how often fundraisers are allowed to collect cash			0
they also say they have to ensure charity collectors are limited in their efforts to make sure they do not become ' irritating ' to the public			0
but local businesses have slammed the decision and are calling for @entity8 to be allowed to collect money as often as possible			0
@entity60 , of @entity61 in @entity26 , said : ' if other charities have complained , they must be jealous that @entity14 has got off his backside to do something to help			0
' he entertains so many people			0
they crowd around him , and he does an amazing job			0
cute : @entity8 , an @entity71 runner duck , pictured when he was just days old ' we all feel very upset because it ’s such an amazing charity			2
' mr @entity10 says the enforcement was started by @entity77 , who told him certain charities had complained			1
he is now facing the same instructions from @entity81 and @entity22 district councils			0
a @entity77 spokesman said : ' all he ’s got to do is apply for a street collection permit , which is a fairly simple process			0
' our policy is to allow one charity collection per day per parish , so that the streets are n’t full of people collecting for charity , which is irritating to the public			2
' we need to give all charities equal opportunities to collect			0
' @entity95 , director of fundraising for the hospice , said @entity8 ’s work had been ‘ wonderful ’			2
she said : ' @entity14 and @entity8 are tremendous in their fundraising efforts and in their wonderful support of the sick children			1

@entity10 told that @entity8 the duck could be deemed ' irritating ' by the public
mr @entity10 fears permit would restrict how many days they could work each month
the *quirky* double - act have raised thousands of pounds for sick children by collecting on the streets of @entity22
