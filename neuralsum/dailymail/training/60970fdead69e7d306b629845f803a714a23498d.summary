by @entity1 reporter published : 03:27 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 03:28 est , 4 september 2012 @entity2 can speed up recovery in tuberculosis patients , say researchers			2
it suggests that the 19th century practice of sending patients to retreats to soak up the sun 's rays could have done some good			0
the latest study found patients recovered more quickly from the infection lung disease if they combined antibiotics with exposure to sunlight			0
catching the rays : @entity2 appears to dampen inflammatory responses the findings , from @entity23 , suggest high doses of the vitamin dampen down the body 's inflammatory response to infection , reducing damage to the lungs			1
study leader @entity31 , said : ' sometimes these inflammatory responses can cause tissue damage leading to ... cavities in the lung			1
' if we can help these cavities to heal more quickly , then patients should be infectious for a shorter period of time , and they may also suffer less lung damage			0
' the researchers also said they think vitamin d 's ability to dampen inflammatory responses without interfering with the action of antibiotics suggests supplements might be useful for patients taking antibiotics for diseases like pneumonia , sepsis and other lung infections			1
@entity6 , which people in wealthier parts of the world often mistakenly believe to be a thing of the past , is proving a tough disease to beat			2
in 2010 , it infected 8.8 million people worldwide and killed 1.4 million			0
drug - resistant cases of @entity6 are on the rise in the @entity62 , according to figures released in july			1
in 2010 , there were 342 cases which could not be dealt with by traditional antibiotics , while in 2011 , this figure rose to 431			2
the infection destroys lung tissue , causing patients to cough up the bacteria which then spreads through the air and can be inhaled by others			0
in recent years , rates of drug - resistant @entity6 have been spreading fast across the world , causing alarm among public health officials and prompting calls for more research into new and more effective treatments			1
human lung section with tuberculosis : the infection destroys lung tissue causing patients to cough up bacteria , spreading it the researchers , whose study was published by the @entity90 on monday , split 95 @entity6 patients who were on standard antibiotic treatment into two groups			2
for the first eight weeks of their treatment , 44 of them were also given high dose vitamin d , while the remaining 51 got placebos			0
@entity99 from @entity62 's @entity100 measured signs of inflammation in blood samples to see what effect the vitamin d had on immune responses			1
' we found that a large number of these inflammatory markers fell further and faster in patients receiving vitamin d , ' she said			0
the researchers also found that @entity115 , the bacteria that cause @entity6 , cleared from the phlegm coughed up from deep in the lungs faster in patients on vitamin d , taking an average of 23 days to become undetectable under the microscope compared to 36 days in those on placebo			0
@entity31 said it was too early to recommend all @entity6 patients take high - dose vitamin d alongside antibiotics , as more research with a larger group of patients was needed first .			1

@entity2 appears to dampen inflammatory responses without *affecting* effect of antibiotics
drug - resistant cases of @entity6 are on the rise in the @entity62
