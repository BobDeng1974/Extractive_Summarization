spy : @entity8 during his undercover days in the mid- 1980s ( left ) and the academic and lecturer as he is now ( right )			1
he has been exposed as a police spy - master who led a network of undercover officers in political activist groups mr @entity8 became head of the unit after around a decade working undercover , reported @entity32			1
he has previously admitted working for special branch between 1980 and 2006 , but has never revealed his past as a police spy			0
ironically , mr @entity8 's secret undercover work was revealed on saturday at a @entity38 conference , at which he was a speaker			2
fellow activists at the event claimed he used the alias @entity41 while a member of @entity13 between 1984 and 1988			1
the group campaigned for environmental issues including nuclear disarmament and claims ' @entity41 ' attended numerous protests and meetings			2
it is also believed that mr @entity8 infiltrated animal rights groups			2
but he was actually a member of the @entity52 , a police unit dedicated to infiltrating political groups thought to pose a threat to public order			1
when urged to apologise at the conference for his undercover work , mr @entity8 refused to comment , the activists claim			2
undercover : mr @entity8 ( wearing a red jacket ) attends a protest during the period he infiltrated @entity13 he last week urged people to attend to ' show a united front against hatred and bigotry and celebrate the diversity of our multicultural communities '			1
in the late 1990s , mr @entity8 became head of the @entity52 and was responsible for placing police moles in political organisations			1
from 2002 to 2007 , he was in charge of @entity74 's @entity73 , tasked with preventing @entity76 extremism by way of two - way dialogue with the @entity73 community			0
since 2006 , he has lectured at @entity80 and @entity82 's @entity81 is the seventh police officer to be unmasked as a spy inside protest organisations			2
alternate life : @entity86 spent seven years undercover as an eco-activist before allegedly going ' native ' and naming another campaigner as an officer the most high - profile of these was @entity86 , who spent seven years undercover as an eco-activist before allegedly going ' native ' and naming another campaigner as an officer when he was rumbled			0
a spokesman for @entity13 today said : ' by publicly exposing this latest scandal , campaigners have demonstrated that the recent police spies outed were not " rogue officers " , but part of an unacceptable pattern of immoral infiltration of environmental groups , condoned at a high level			1
' we demand action to ensure that the full truth is revealed and that justice is done			0
' a report into @entity86 and the work of undercover police officers in protest groups is scheduled to be published on thursday			0
racked with guilt at betraying his new friends after seven years of pretence , @entity86 apparently confessed that a female officer in her 30s was also a spy			0
she lived in @entity118 and played a major part in organising a protest intended to close down the @entity122 coal - fired power station in @entity123			0
the group had already grown suspicious after she disappeared overnight in 2008 claiming she had fallen in love with a man in @entity127			0
she was never seen again			0
senior police chiefs were in january said to be worried @entity86 , who went under the name @entity130 in his alternate life , had also compromised the safety of other officers working covertly			0
telling friends who were protesters that the officer was working undercover is a serious breach of protocol which could mean other operatives have to be moved for their safety .			0

between 1984 - 88 he was a member of @entity13 and attended protests
he became head of covert police protest unit in 1990s
