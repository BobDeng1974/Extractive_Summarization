a female student who was allegedly raped by her former boyfriend has claimed her @entity3 college has accused her of ' harassment ' after she filed a complaint against him			0
the student , identified only by her first name @entity9 , says she now faces possible expulsion from @entity11 in @entity12 for repeatedly calling for punishment over the alleged sexual assault , which she says took place in march 2012 while staying at her former boyfriend 's fraternity house			1
following a complaint from @entity9 , the @entity19 @entity21 's @entity20 has reportedly informed the small college of 1,100 students that it has been placed under investigation			0
under investigation : the student says she now faces possible expulsion from @entity11 in @entity12 ( pictured ) for repeatedly calling for punishment over the alleged sexual assault two years of correspondence between @entity9 and the college reportedly showed she had been told to take her complaint of sexual assault and ongoing harassment to the police and at one point had been asked to move off campus			1
this is despite a @entity19 federal gender equality law requiring colleges to make every effort to prevent and intervene in all incidents of harassment that have been brought to their attention			0
according to the @entity43 , the episode began shortly before a week - long holiday in the autumn of 2011 , when @entity9 fell out with her then dormitory roommate and the college gave her roughly one day 's notice to leave the property			0
she claims the college subsequently failed to provide alternative accommodation , leaving her little option other than the stay with her former boyfriend and his fraternity house			0
she says it was during this period that her former boyfriend sexually assaulted her after he had been drinking heavily			0
@entity9 says it was roughly one month before she felt comfortable enough to report the sexual assault , adding that she had requested to speak to a female security officer			2
she claims , however , that a male security officer pressured her into reporting it to him instead and refused to let her leave the room until she signed a written agreement not to press criminal charges			1
a later hearing at the college found @entity9 's former boyfriend not guilty of the alleged sexual assault after he claimed not to have been in the building at the time , and concluded that the male security officer had simply been ' anxious to help '			2
a spokeswoman for @entity76 ( pictured ) insisted the college takes all reports of sexual misconduct seriously and insisted it would fully cooperate with the @entity81 's investigation over the following two years , @entity9 says her former boyfriend 's new girlfriend repeatedly harassed her as she fought to have the case against him reopened			2
the @entity20 initially worked with @entity9 and reached a mediation agreement last summer to allow her to file a claim of harassment against her alleged attacker and his new girlfriend			2
when that case was dismissed last november , the college then allowed the couple to claim that it was in fact them who were being subjected to harassment , claiming @entity9 's repeat attempts to have sexual assault charges filed against her former boyfriend breached their rights			1
the college was quoted by the @entity43 as saying that it concluded that the attempts to have alleged attacker punished ' whether through campus security , the campus conduct review process , his fraternity , the court system , or the @entity21 , do appear to be a type of harassment '			1
they reportedly added that @entity9 would face no punishment however , as the form of harassment they were accusing her of is n't covered by the school code of conduct			0
the @entity20 is now investigating whether the college failed in its duty to stop harasment against @entity9 after it had been reported , and whether or not it had permitted retaliation against a sexual assault victim when allowing the alleged attacker and his girlfriend permission to file their own harassment claim			1
a spokesman for @entity76 insisted the college takes all reports of sexual misconduct seriously and insisted it would fully cooperate with the @entity81 's investigation			0
in the meantime , 38 students have reportedly signed a letter in support of @entity9 warning they will withhold donations and discourage people from attending @entity11 until the case is resolved and the college overhauls its policies on sexual assault .			1

victim says alleged attacker was n't *adequately* punished for sexual assault
claims @entity11 pressured her into not pressing criminal charges
made repeat attempts to have alleged rape by *ex-boyfriend* taken seriously
says she then suffered two years of harassment when case was dismissed
now her ex and his new girlfriend are claiming they are being harassed
@entity12 - based college agrees , saying calls for punishment are harassment
