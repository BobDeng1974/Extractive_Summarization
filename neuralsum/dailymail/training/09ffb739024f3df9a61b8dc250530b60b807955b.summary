who should be @entity1 's next captain ? it ’s not easy retiring from @entity1			1
you do n’t just pick up the phone and tell the @entity5 you have had enough then quietly move on			2
ending an @entity1 career is big news and i know exactly how @entity9 felt on monday when he announced that he had reached the end of the line with his country			1
i made the same move in 2007 , even though i briefly returned for the @entity14 in 2010			0
our respective circumstances could not be more different			0
my decision was born of frustration			2
i was not playing for @entity20 ’s team as much as i felt i deserved ; i had just played in two @entity22 finals but could n’t dislodge @entity23 and @entity24			2
@entity9 has been mulling this over for a while , weighing up what he should do , but the closer it came to revealing his decision , the more difficult he found it			1
when we spoke , my advice to him was that international retirement would benefit him as much mentally as physically			2
he is in great condition at the minute , so i am not sure the extra games would have been a problem ; being @entity1 captain , though , comes with huge responsibility and pressure and those demands can be draining			1
now he will be able to get time to completely switch off and be refreshed for the @entity22 games that will be on @entity33 ’s agenda and recover from the little fitness niggles footballers tend to carry			2
@entity33 , certainly , will benefit from this decision			1
leader : @entity9 captained @entity1 at two @entity68 and one @entity69 @entity1 , by contrast , will miss him			1
but how will he be remembered ? i described him as a great servant			0
unfortunately for @entity9 and others , such as @entity75 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity76 , there will always be that feeling of what might have been			2
for players of that quality never to reach a major semi-final with @entity1 , let alone win an international trophy , will be considered a major disappointment and that is why @entity9 once rated his @entity1 career as ‘ six out of 10 , maybe seven ’			1
i think that is harsh			0
winning 114 caps is a phenomenal achievement to look back on when he finally hangs up his boots			0
considering the games he missed through injury when he was younger , he could have smashed @entity93 ’s record of 125 appearances			0
there were highlights , too , such as goals at two @entity14 finals , scoring in the 5 - 1 win over @entity100 and the goal that took @entity1 to @entity102			1
he was unselfish , as he played in a variety of roles in midfield and got on with his job			0
wonderstrike : gerrard scores in @entity1 's 5 - 1 win over @entity100 in 2001 glory days : @entity34 ( left ) and @entity9 celebrate winning the @entity22 in 2005 old friends : @entity24 ( second right ) with @entity9 on international duty back in 2006 @entity114 @entity33 legends salute @entity9 he did that because he loved playing for @entity1			1
i once said i never felt the same affinity for @entity1 as i did for @entity33 because i was on the outside looking in			1
with @entity120 , nothing could have been more different			0
the pride he felt leading the side , particularly under @entity124 , was there for all to see			0
having suffered such disappointment when caretaker @entity127 picked @entity128 as skipper against @entity130 in february 2012 , being made permanent captain brought him such joy			0
that ’s why he did n’t make this announcement without giving it maximum thought .			0
