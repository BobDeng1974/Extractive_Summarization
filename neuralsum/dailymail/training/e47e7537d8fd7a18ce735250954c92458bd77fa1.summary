mr @entity25 described the mp 's behaviour on the night as ' childish ' and said his version of events was inconsistent with @entity30 footage in a hearing last november			2
today the same judge rejected @entity0 's bid to reduce his overall bill after the mp tried to claim that he should only have gone against one legal team , rather than two at @entity38 's @entity37			1
the single day 's hearing today cost a staggering £ 70,000 with @entity41 ' lawyers billing for £ 49,917 and @entity43 's team £ 20,064			2
@entity0 has already paid £ 300,000 in ' interim payments ' to @entity17 and @entity45 following the trial			1
his full bill will be analysed by a specialist costs judge on a date yet to be determined			1
after losing the libel trial in november , the costs of the entire litigation were unofficially estimated at £ 3million			1

mr @entity25 described the mp 's behaviour on the night as ' childish ' and said his version of events was inconsistent with @entity30 footage ( pictured ) in a hearing last november mr @entity25 rejected arguments that @entity0 should only pay for @entity43 's costs , rather than @entity17 's as well			1
@entity80 , for @entity0 , had argued his client should not pay for lawyers representing @entity17 , as this was ' duplication ' and ' not proportionate '			1
he said : ' did litigating this issue really require two [ legal ] teams ? ' ' there should have been only one team - end of story			0
' mr @entity89 argued @entity45 ' had the whip - hand ' over @entity17 , and could have arranged to argue the case alongside @entity17 , rather than separately			2

@entity114 , a specialist costs lawyer representing @entity17 , said ' the sensible course ' was to have two separate legal teams for @entity43 and the newspaper			1

' it is mr @entity0 who has not assisted the court here ' , he said , ' he did not attempt to use the budgeting process to his advantage , so the sympathy which the court has thus far tentatively expressed [ for him ] does need to be looked at in the light of our submissions '			2

' there would have been a trial of the preliminary issue between him and @entity45 only			0
only one set of costs would have been incurred and would have been paid by him , if - as was the case - he lost			2
' he said lawyers for @entity17 ' were entitled to protect their interests in any reasonable manner which they saw fit			2
they made an offer which would have eliminated all risks of adverse costs findings , both for themselves and mr @entity0 , at the trial of the preliminary issue			1
' mr @entity25 refused to direct that @entity0 should only pay one of his opponent 's costs , saying , ' accordingly , i decline to make the expression or view i otherwise would			1

' may 2011 : the mp arrived at the main gate of @entity16 on his bicycle and told officers : ' let me in			2
i 'm a @entity187 mp and i 'm late for a meeting			0
' pc @entity189 had no idea who he was so phoned the control room at @entity194			0

' june 2011 : for a second time mr @entity0 had a confrontation with @entity201 at the @entity16 gates – but this time the officer refused to let him through due to ' security reasons '			2
when @entity206 arrived by car the officers had to open the main gate			0
they finally allowed mr @entity0 through after a polite request from mr @entity206			2

' inspector @entity246 said he found this ' rather insulting , discourteous and demeaning '			0
august 17 , 2011 : two weeks later mr @entity0 ' launched into a foul - mouthed tirade ' at members of his protection team when a trip from @entity260 to @entity261 was changed for security reasons			0
inspector @entity246 said : ' he used a tirade of language that … was just swearing for the sake of swearing			0
' mr @entity0 demanded to know how many officers had been sent to @entity260 in advance of him and allegedly accused them of treating it as a holiday			1
he allegedly said : ' @entity272 taxpayers are funding this for police officers to sit by the pool			1
