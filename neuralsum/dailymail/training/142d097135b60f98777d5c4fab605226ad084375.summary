@entity0 has been paid with taxpayers ' money to return to @entity3 an illegal immigrant and sham marriage ringleader who left prison early with a huge pay - off has used the money to set up a new business in his homeland - offering @entity11 passports			1
@entity0 , 33 , came to the @entity11 with his wife @entity13 , 34 , on student visas then faked marriages to two @entity17 people to gain residency			1
the fraudster was jailed for conspiring to breach immigration law , but was then handed £ 1,500 of taxpayers ' money - on condition of leaving @entity11 and returning to his native country - as part of a @entity28 scheme for rehabilitating foreign nationals			1
he had only served seven months of his two - year sentence			1
today , it emerged @entity0 has used the money to set up @entity33 - a company providing @entity11 passports , visas and driving licences in @entity37 , @entity3 , his home country			1
among its other services , it also bizarrely offers ' any enquiry related to the laws of cricket '			1
he is not currently under investigation by the @entity3 authorities			2
@entity47 , political director of the @entity48 , branded the payout a ' sick golden goodbye '			0
he said : ' when all of us are having to tighten our belts and watch every penny , pay - offs for fraudsters like @entity0 at @entity11 taxpayers ' expense are an utter disgrace			1
' ministers must urgently review the operation of the @entity61 to ensure that we are not being taken for a ride			0
@entity0 's shop , @entity33 , in @entity37 , @entity68 , has signs in @entity70 saying : ' @entity71 ' , ' @entity66 ' , ' @entity65 ' , ' @entity64 ' ... and , bizarrely , ' any enquiry related to the @entity72 ' ' at the same time , the @entity11 police should do all they can to assist the local authorities in @entity68 in establishing the legitimacy of @entity0 's new enterprise			1
' taxpayers will be appalled to learn that £ 1,500 of their hard - earned money was used to give a convicted prisoner this sick " golden goodbye " prior to his deportation			1
' under the @entity61 , foreign criminals in @entity11 jails are being offered £ 1,500 each in cash if they agree to go home part of the way through their sentences			1
when they leave , they receive a cash card loaded with £ 500			1
a further £ 1,000 of @entity11 taxpayers ’ cash is payable within the first three months of their arrival home			1
the card is programmed to work in atm machines around the world			0
the offer is even available to criminals who have served their entire sentence in @entity11 – at a cost of £ 45,000 a year			1
they will get a cash payment of £ 750			2
in opposition , the @entity103 said the scheme was ‘ simply outrageous ’			0
@entity106 , then conservative justice spokesman , said : ‘ the lesson is clear : under @entity110 , crime pays and the taxpayer foots the bill			0
’ now the @entity113 says the scheme will save money , because it is cheaper than forcibly removing foreign criminals or leaving them in jail			2
once the criminals return home they have to make a claim that they need cash for rent , private healthcare or help to establish a business before they can obtain the £ 1,000			2
officials have struggled for years to deport foreign convicts and more than 11,000 are currently taking up space in @entity11 ’s packed jails			2
@entity0 and @entity131 were jailed last march for their faked relationships with the two @entity17			0
the pair were arrested at their home in @entity136 , @entity137 , for conspiring to breach immigration law			0
police recovered around £ 16,300 in cash and bank receipts showing large amounts of money paid into the accounts of their fake partners , when the couple were arrested			2
@entity0 was deported last july and paid as part of the @entity149 for foreign nationals as an ' incentive for prisoners to co-operate with returning at the earliest opportunity '			0
but he used the payout to set up his new business in @entity68 , providing @entity11 passports , driving licences and national insurance cards to @entity3 nationals			1
a @entity149 spokesman said : ' the scheme saves the taxpayer the cost of keeping foreign national prisoners in prison and denies them the opportunity to re-offend			0
' it should be noted that , as part of our investigation that resulted in @entity0 's conviction , more than £ 16,000 in cash was seized from his address under the @entity174			2
this has subsequently been returned to the public purse			0
' @entity13 voluntarily departed so did not receive any money under the scheme			2
' at the @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity3 , the @entity149 subjects all applications for visas to come to the @entity11 to the same rigorous checks , which include checks against international watchlists			1
' in addition , all visa applicants are required to give their biometrics ( fingerprints )			0
' staff receive forgery and detection training and there are tough penalties for the submission of false documents and information			0
' anyone doing so will not only have their visa application refused , but also face a ban of up to ten years on future visa applications			0
' a video of the launch of @entity0 's new office , which has been removed from @entity205 , shows a poster of @entity11 driving licences , passports of various nationalities and a @entity11 national insurance number card			1
it also features an @entity213 ( @entity213 ) logo , which has been used without permission			0
@entity0 's office has signs in @entity70 saying : ' @entity71 ' , ' @entity66 ' , ' @entity222 ' , ' @entity64 ' , ' registering power of attorney ' , ' @entity219 / statements ' , ' @entity217 and @entity218 ' , ' any legal disputes ' and , bizarrely , ' @entity215 to the @entity72 '			0
having been alerted to the misuse of its logo by @entity136 on sunday newspaper , the @entity213 said in a statement : ' he does not have our permission to use either the @entity231 or @entity213 logos for commercial or business purposes and we thank @entity136 on sunday for bringing this to our attention			0
' we will investigate whether the logos are being used improperly			0

@entity237 served 7 months of two - year sentence
given taxpayers ' money to get out of jail and leave @entity11
he used cash to set up shop offering passports , visas ... and ' any enquiry related to the laws of cricket '
