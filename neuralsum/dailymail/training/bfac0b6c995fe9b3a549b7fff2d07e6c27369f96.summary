by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:50 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 17:55 est , 5 june 2013 ' very worrying case ' : re teacher @entity3 has been allowed to carry on working in schools despite being cautioned for possessing indecent images of children a teacher who downloaded child porn has been allowed to resume his career by the @entity10			1
@entity3 , 36 , was sacked , given a police caution and ordered to sign the @entity12 after admitting viewing sickening images over several years			1
but a professional conduct panel said the married @entity16 teacher could return to the classroom because of his ‘ excellent teaching ’			2
a senior official , acting on behalf of education secretary @entity19 , rubber - stamped the decision , saying there was a ‘ need to be proportionate and to act in the public interest ’			0
last night the case sparked a furious reaction from mps , schools campaigners and a children ’s charity			0
research has shown that one in six men who view child porn go on to abuse children			2
fears about the effects of child porn have been heightened after child killers @entity37 and @entity39 were found to have been heavy users of it in the run up to the murders of @entity37 , five , and @entity39 , 12			2
culture secretary @entity44 has summoned internet giants , including @entity46 , to a summit in an attempt to find ways to reduce the amount of harmful material available online			0
the @entity3 case is similar to a scandal that rocked @entity54 in 2006 and damaged then education secretary @entity56 ’s reputation			2
at the time , @entity58 - based pe teacher @entity57 was told he could continue working after receiving a caution for viewing child porn			1
@entity3 was a teacher at @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 , for ten years until he was sacked in december 2011			1
disgraced : @entity3 , 36 , was dismissed from his ten - year career at @entity65 ( above ) , in @entity62 , @entity63 , after he accepted a police caution details of his web habits were revealed in a report by the @entity70 after its professional conduct panel considered his case			1
he initially visited an internet site in 2009 and viewed ‘ six child abuse images ’			1
by the time police seized his computer in december last year he had seen 143 images – assessed to be on the lowest ‘ level one ’ scale for seriousness			1
another 46 more serious ‘ level three ’ images , including scenes of child abuse , were on the computer but had not been viewed			1
the panel said the photographs were ‘ not at the most serious end of the scale but , nevertheless , embarking on the process of downloading such images may lead to the viewing of more serious images ’			1
all - clear : education secretary @entity19 ( left ) has now supported a disciplinary panel ’s recommendation that @entity3 does not pose a risk to children and that he should be able to resume his teaching career the report said @entity3 had used the website for ‘ two to three years on and off			1
’ instead of being taken to court , he was given the option of accepting a police caution			2
the panel decided his actions amounted to ‘ conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute ’ and his behaviour amounted to ‘ unacceptable professional conduct ’			0
but it took his ‘ excellent ’ teaching history into account and said the ‘ principle of proportionality ’ had been taken into account in deciding he should be allowed to continue teaching in future			1
its conclusions were forwarded to the @entity10 where the official concluded : ‘ although the findings in the case are serious ones ... i support the recommendation of the panel that a prohibition order should not be applied in this case			0
’ @entity3 had been put on a ‘ barred list ’ by the @entity129 , which replaced the @entity130 , but his name was removed last june			2
yesterday @entity133 @entity132 said : ‘ this is a very worrying case and i suspect most parents would feel very uneasy about this man being able to continue teaching , given his past record			1
‘ i think that in such cases there should be an automatic bar on people being able to teach			0
’ @entity143 , chairman of the @entity144 , said : ‘ since this involved indecent images of children it should have been taken more seriously			1
many parents would be very concerned to know this person was teaching their children			2
’ an @entity152 spokesman added : ‘ it ’s shocking that someone who downloaded images of children should be allowed to continue to teach in a school			0
‘ and i ’m sure most parents will feel very uncomfortable knowing mr @entity3 is back in the classroom			1
’ parents connected to @entity160 were also astonished			0
mother - of - five @entity161 , whose son recently attended the school , said : ‘ i certainly would n’t want my child to be taught by anyone who has done that			0
he should n’t get a job as a lollipop man let alone in a school			0
’ a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ the secretary of state does not make these decisions himself			0
they are made by an independent panel and reviewed by a senior official			0
‘ we keep the process under review because of legal complexities and we are examining whether this case was handled correctly			0
’ @entity3 has been married to wife @entity181 for almost ten years			2
it was not clear last night if she is standing by him but a woman was seen at his home in @entity186			0
@entity3 declined to comment when approached .			0
