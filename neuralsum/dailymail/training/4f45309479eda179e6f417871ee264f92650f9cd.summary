lawyers working on behalf of @entity11 , whose conviction was highlighted in the 2003 @entity14 - nominated documentary ' capturing the @entity15 , ' want to review grand jury testimony and transcripts of witness interviews			1
' every aspect , every part , every piece of paper generated in the matter of @entity25 ' will be released to @entity11 's defense team , state supreme court judge @entity19 ordered following a brief hearing			1
the prosecutors said they intend to appeal @entity19 's order , they had opposed the release , citing concerns about victims ' privacy			0
' after more than two decades , several guilty pleas , a complete appeal process , and a full and independent re-investigation , the victims in this case deserve closure and privacy , ' said @entity62 , a spokesman for district attorney @entity63			0
' we are disappointed by the decision and will absolutely be appealing and expecting to prevail on behalf of the victims in a higher court			0

at left is @entity11 's defense attorney , @entity76 in june the @entity78 's office had issued a 155 - page report that reiterated that @entity11 's original conviction in 1988 had been proper and correct			1
@entity11 was just 19 years old when he and his father @entity37 were jailed for allegedly molesting children who attended their after school computer class in @entity85 , @entity7			1
@entity11 served 13 years in prison and was released in 2001			1
now married and living in @entity87 , @entity88 , he has been trying for more than a decade to clear his name			0
the documentary about the @entity11 ’s case – and the inconsistencies in the evidence against them – was released in 2002			1
directed by @entity68 , ‘ capturing the @entity15 ’ was nominated for the @entity95 in 2003			1
' this ruling is an attempt to correct a fraudulent report that was based upon false information that the @entity78 knew was fraudulent , ' said @entity68 following thursday 's decision by @entity19			0
the @entity11 case has drawn comparisons to the 1980s @entity104 preschool scandal involving allegations of sex abuse , but the investigators in their june report said the two cases ' were in no way similar			2
' @entity19 on thursday was particularly critical of a portion of the @entity78 's report that claimed @entity11 , while in prison in 2000 , had written " fictional " stories that described violent and disturbing sexual acts , including incest involving a father and his children , sex with a dog and child rape			1
@entity11 pictured in 1988 , when he was 19 and then in 2004 , three years after his release from prison after serving 13 years prosecutors also said he had been disciplined for possessing a photograph of 2 pre-pubescent girls - at least 1 of whom was naked - torn from the pages of a magazine in violation of the terms of his sex offender counseling program			1
defense attorney @entity76 has maintained that @entity11 was acquitted of those prison charges ; a claim that an assistant district attorney reluctantly confirmed thursday			0
' we ca n't function in the justice system in this fashion , ' the judge said in a scathing rebuke			0
' this is a country that has no feeling of credibility when it comes to our institutions			0
' since his release from prison in 2001 , @entity11 has been registered as a @entity151 sex offender which continues to prevent him from leading a normal life and prevents him from living near schools , playgrounds , day - care centers , and houses of worship			1
the nightmare for @entity11 began in november 1987 after his father @entity37 received a child pornography magazine in the mail from the @entity162			1
authorities were alerted and when they searched the @entity11 home they found a stash of 20 magazines containing child porn			0
after learning that @entity169 taught a computer class to children aged eight - to - 10 - year - old from his home , local police began to suspect him of abusing his students			0
@entity68 directed the film ' capturing the @entity15 ' and has spent the past 10 years working to help @entity11 clear his name @entity11 helped his father run the computer classes and so he too became a suspect			1
initially detectives did n't find much evidence , but after some of the children were interviewed as many as 15 times they began to speak out about alleged abuse			0
some children started to claim that @entity11 had played bizarre sex games with them during their computer classes			0
other claims strained credibility , one student would have had to have been molested an average of six times during every one of the 20 90 - minute classes they took if their allegation was true			0
however with a witch - hunt brewing , @entity37 and @entity11 were charged with hundreds of counts of sodomy , sexual abuse , and employing a minor in an obscene performance			1
initially they fought the charges , but as prosecutors added hundreds of new charges @entity37 decided he had no choice but to plead guilty since the only physical evidence in the case was his collection of child porn			1
according to the family he confessed in the hopes that his son would be spared prison time			0
@entity213 also accused @entity11 's friend @entity214 of joining the @entity15 ' molestation			1
faced with 118 charges against him , 17 - year - old @entity214 admitting that he and @entity217 had abused kids			0
in exchange for this testimony he was promised six months in jail and a cleansed record upon his release , but after testifying before the grand jury he was sentenced to two - to - six years in prison			2
family torn apart by tragedy : @entity169 ( father ) , @entity229 ( mother ) and their three boys , @entity11 ( left ) @entity0 ( middle ) , and @entity233 ( right ) at @entity235 's bar mitzvah police searched @entity169 's home and found his stash of 20 magazines containing child porn facing life in prison , @entity11 decided he had no choice but to cut his own deal			1
then aged 19 he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing 14 children in his father 's home computer class and was sentenced to 18 years in prison			2
the court never heard from a witness or saw any evidence			0
terrified of what awaited him in prison as a child molester , @entity11 undertook some misguided damage - control			2
he gave an interview to @entity257 , inventing a story of his own abuse at the hands of his father			0
once in prison , @entity11 reverted to maintaining his innocence - a position that led to being denied parole four times			2
he was eventually released from prison in 2001 after serving 13 years of his sentence , while he father committed suicide in prison in 1995 by taking a massive overdose of antidepressant			1
in 2004 , @entity11 ’s lawyers filed a motion arguing that newly available evidence warranted reopening the case			2
now married , to wife @entity278 , and living in @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity11 hopes his case will inspire other victims of injustice successive courts rejected the appeal until 2010 , when a federal appeals court took the unusual step and urged prosecutors to reopen the case , saying that @entity11 may have been wrongfully convicted			2
the decision cited ' overzealousness ' by law enforcement officials swept up in the hysteria over child molestation in the 1980s			0
the ruling noted that ' the quality of the evidence was extraordinarily suspect			0
' taken together , the court said , ' the record here suggests " a reasonable likelihood " that @entity11 was wrongfully convicted			0
' the da 's investigation took nearly three years to compile , but when it was released in june it was n't the verdict that @entity11 had been hoping for			2
the report not only affirmed @entity11 's conviction , but ' added critical context , and in some cases supplied refuting evidence ' to dis - spell theories put forward by @entity11 and his advocates			1
unperturbed by the @entity78 's report , @entity11 and his lawyers have continued to fight and will be hoping that the release 25 - year - old documents used in his prosecution all those years ago will provide hope			1
since his release from prison in 2001 , @entity11 has sought to clear his name and have his name removed from the sex offender register			2
