ministers say @entity48 residents are currently granted @entity14 numbers far too easily , usually after turning up at a gp surgery			2
on referral to hospital , no further questions about their entitlement to treatment are asked – providing ‘ health tourists ’ or those who have fallen ill while in this country with unlimited free access to the @entity14			1
the new healthcare levy will be in addition to the visa charge for anyone coming to the @entity7 for more than six months			1
currently , short - term migrants coming to the @entity7 either to study or work , with more than six months on their visas , are likely to qualify for free hospital care as soon as they enter the @entity7			1

landlords who fail to check that their tenants are not illegal immigrants face being fined up to £ 3,000 under plans unveiled today			2

all private landlords will have to carry out checks on the migration status of every tenant before renting out a room or house			0
immigration minister @entity93 , pictured , said : ‘ the government is determined to build a fairer system and to address the public 's concern about immigration			2

last night the plan was backed by @entity103 , a @entity11 shadow health minister , who said : ‘ people who are not eligible for free care must pay for the treatment they receive and be rigorously pursued for the money they owe			1
’ she stressed that the last @entity11 government had taken some action on the issue and ' any abuse must be tackled '			0
but today her colleague ms @entity16 dismissed the plan to stop money being wasted on treatment for people who not qualify			2
writing on @entity117 she said : ' what price xenophobia ? stigmatising foreigners accessing @entity14 creates a public health risk			2
' @entity11 sources stressed that ms @entity16 's view was not the official party line			0
but the extraordinary remark was condemned by the government			0
@entity127 chairman @entity126 said : ' our nhs should be a national health service , not an international health service			1
that 's fair for the hardworking people who pay for it			0
‬ ‬ ‪ ‪ ' it 's bizarre that @entity11 oppose this			0
once again it shows that @entity136 is too weak to stand up for hardworking people			0
' a @entity127 source added : ' @entity16 ’s comment shows @entity11 is n’t serious about getting fairness for the hardworking people whose taxes fund our @entity14			0
' we are taking action to ensure that people who are supposed to be paying for @entity14 care do so			2
' it ’s sad a @entity148 thinks this is xenophobic			0
' a government consultation being launched today will also explore whether migrants should be allowed to show they have private health insurance as an alternative			1
today ’s proposals will also mean foreigners visiting for less than six months will no longer be able to see a gp for free , with a charge introduced			1
split : the plans were backed by one @entity11 health spokesman but @entity160 said they risked stigmatising foreigners criticism : @entity11 's shadow health minister @entity164 used @entity117 to voice opposition to plans to charge foreigners to use the @entity14 visitors from the @entity169 would continue to access @entity14 for free but ministers say they will put in place systems for recovering the costs from their home countries			1
mr @entity4 will propose a new ‘ registration and tracking system ’ for visitors before they join a gp surgery , possibly linked to the @entity14 number			1
those with a ‘ questionable ’ residency status – meaning they should be billed for non-emergency @entity14 care – could be issued with only a temporary @entity14 number			2
this would mean that if they tried to access anything other than accident and emergency departments , they would be charged			0
treatment : currently , short - term migrants coming to the @entity7 either to study or work , with more than six months on their visas , are likely to qualify for free hospital care as soon as they enter the @entity7 ( file picture ) the health secretary will also promise better checks to enforce charges for care in both hospitals and doctors ’ surgeries			1

‘ what we do n't want to do is put people at risk ... not just the migrants but also us , ’ she told @entity228 's today			2
‘ people use the @entity14 if they 've got infections and we certainly do n't want to have people wandering around for fear of being charged at the gp surgery			0
’ she added : ‘ at the moment we are fairly accessible and i think it is important to keep it that way			0
‘ i do n't think we should be turning the @entity243 surgery into a border agency			0
' i think we should be making sure that people who do feel that they are ill can come and access us because we certainly do n't want people who have got @entity248 or @entity249 or any other infectious disease , or in fact anybody that believes themselves to be ill , to be frightened of seeing a gp for fear of being charged			0
