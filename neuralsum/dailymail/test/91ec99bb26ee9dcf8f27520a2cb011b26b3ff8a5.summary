sunday 's trip to @entity1 marks @entity3 ’s 700th game under the ownership of @entity5 , a period @entity6 says has been positive not only for the club but for @entity9 football as a whole			1
some would quibble with the second part of that statement , but @entity6 says that too will change			2
if the first 699 games under @entity15 rule has established @entity3 at the top of @entity9 and @entity18 football , @entity6 believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the @entity9 national team as they implement @entity5 ’s demand to follow @entity24 ( @entity24 ) rules			1
sunday 's trip to @entity1 marks @entity3 ’s 700th game under the ownership of @entity5 @entity5 ( right ) celebrates with @entity25 ( centre ) and @entity27 after @entity3 clinch their first @entity29 title under his ownership in 2005 the @entity15 finally got his hands on the @entity33 trophy following @entity3 's success in 2012 @entity6 also believes @entity3 ’s adherence to @entity24 — ‘ compared with other clubs and owners who did n’t want to play under the rules ’ , he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at @entity37 — positions them as standard bearers for the @entity9 game			1
there can certainly be no doubt @entity3 are in a far stronger position than when @entity5 bought the club from @entity48 for £ 140m on june 1 , 2003			1
in the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £ 842.9m on transfer fees , winning three @entity52 , four @entity53 , three @entity54 , one @entity55 and one @entity33 , but now , @entity6 says , @entity5 ’s rule will benefit @entity57 as well as @entity3			1
@entity6 , seen here with @entity5 in 2004 , has has been in charge of @entity3 for almost five of the @entity15 's 12 seasons at @entity61 the @entity62 have won three @entity52 , four @entity53 , three @entity54 , one @entity55 and one @entity33 since 2004 ‘ he has been good for @entity3 , good for @entity9 football , good for @entity18 football , ’ said @entity6 , who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons			1
‘ @entity3 after him became strong , a top club in the country and a top club in @entity71			2
i think that ’s very , very good			2
i think it ’s important and i think it ’s also important the message mr @entity5 and this club are passing now			2
‘ the decision to accept the [ @entity24 ] rules and play under the rules i think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that did n’t accept the rules and did n’t want to play under the rules			2
@entity3 are in a far stronger position than when @entity5 bought the club from @entity48 in 2003 ‘ will the next 700 games under him be good for the @entity9 national side ? i believe so			1
in the first team , we had some important players in the national team			2
' @entity27 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity25 , @entity94 , @entity95			0
we had a nucleus of four , five players that were always in the national team			0
‘ now we are going through a period where it ’s just about @entity103			0
but we have some young boys coming into the first - team			0
@entity106 [ @entity107 ] is already here			0
normally , in a few years they should be there [ in the national side ]			0
’ @entity103 ( above ) is now @entity3 's only senior @entity57 international in the current first team squad @entity6 believes the likes of @entity112 ( left ) and @entity113 will represent @entity3 and @entity57 for years to come @entity6 did not name them , but @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 are thought to be highly - rated at @entity3 , who supply many of the players in @entity57 ’s age - group teams			1
the question is whether their young @entity9 players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at @entity128 today			1
it is a game @entity3 go into mindful of decisive slips in last season ’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now , @entity6 is confident no mistakes will be made			1
@entity3 are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the @entity138 in march @entity6 has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west @entity142 club he added : ‘ do n’t make me remember the game against @entity144 because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title			1
i do n’t want to speak again about that game			0
‘ last season we were depending on others			0
we needed this team to lose a couple of points here , a couple of points there			0
‘ now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything			0
we do n’t have to be watching @entity37 against @entity159			0
we do n’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do			0
’ @entity163 celebrates scoring the winning goal during @entity144 's 2 - 1 win against @entity3 last season @entity6 believes last season 's defeat against @entity144 ' stopped ' @entity3 from fighting for the title			1
