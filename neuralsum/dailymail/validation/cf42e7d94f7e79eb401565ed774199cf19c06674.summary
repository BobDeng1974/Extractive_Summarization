in assessing his options for the traditional pre-cup final getaway , it can be safely assumed that @entity4 would have sooner set sail for @entity6 , @entity7 , than make the short hop to @entity9			2
as his side left @entity12 with three points in the bag in the middle of last month , the @entity10 thought it best to grant his players a day off to clear their minds before the small matter of @entity19 at @entity20 demanded their full focus			1
by the time the squad reassembled at @entity24 on monday morning , though , their numbers were depleted by one			2
@entity25 , a native of @entity9 , had failed to make his scheduled flight back to @entity27 after returning home for a family visit			1
@entity25 missed @entity31 's big game with @entity19 last month , but is keen to make the most of the next one whether or not @entity25 would have featured against the @entity33 was beside the point			1
his absence left @entity4 with no option but to banish him from what was left of the build - up			1
an unnecessary distraction , if ever there was one			2
for those lucky enough to witness the pulsating 3 - 3 draw that ensued , a sense of bewilderment as to why someone would jeopardise the chance to live out their boyhood dream was compounded by the fact that @entity51 and @entity52 had only recently put further pressure on the @entity55 ’s position			1
yet , if there is a sense of deep regret from the player regarding what transpired , he ’s doing a mighty fine job of hiding it			2
in his eyes , neither a private apology nor a public explanation were warranted			2
only a need to hastily draw a line under the affair			1
asked if he regretted what happened , @entity25 replied : ‘ no. look the situation has been dealt with			1
it ’s as simple as that			2
i ’ve spoken to the gaffer about it and there ’s no issue now			2
’ @entity25 has been battling for his place in the side since failing to return to @entity31 on time before the @entity19 game had he apologised to @entity4 over what had taken place ? ‘ no , ’ he repeated			1
‘ look , i said i spoke to the gaffer about everything and that ’s it – it ’s been dealt with			2
’ so what actually happened ? ‘ there ’s nothing			2
it ’s dealt with , ’ he said			2
but it must have been tough to sit such a huge game out ? ‘ it was difficult , ’ he admitted			2
‘ it ’s difficult for me to miss any game as i want to play every minute of them			2
’ try as he might to consign the matter to history , @entity25 is going to have to go some way to erase it from the minds of his manager and the supporters who pay his wages			1
@entity4 initially left him out of the squad for the subsequent game with @entity106 but 59 minutes against @entity107 and 64 minutes against @entity108 on sunday did at least suggest he ’s now edging off the naughty step			1
with @entity52 and @entity51 cup - tied for sunday ’s final , @entity25 has every chance of featuring at @entity112			1
and to his credit , he acknowledges that the instant impressions made by the recent acquisitions have raised the bar for him			2
‘ there ’s a lot of competition for places here at the minute and even after that ( missing @entity19 ) it ’s not as if i ’ve been a regular in the squad the past few weeks , ’ he stated			1
@entity25 has not made a public apology for his behaviour , but was keen to draw a line under the incident ‘ i ’ve played the last two games			1
even for myself , i would have liked to have played a little bit better because i know the situation with the boys from @entity108			2
‘ they will be straight back in contention as soon as we have these games by us			1
it ’s up to me to obviously go out and try to put my stamp down and keep myself in the team			2
‘ i have n’t been outstanding since i came back in but i have been creating and getting into positions to score but i just have n’t			1
‘ i know the goals will come			0
i have had spells like this before where things have n’t clicked			0
i just need to keep my confidence up and to have enough belief in myself that next time i get an opportunity i will put it away			0
’ there would be no finer time and place to start than sunday at @entity112			1
‘ yes , it would be , especially after the last week , ’ he reflected			0
‘ i had one or two chances but the ball just wo n’t go in the back of the net for me at the moment			1
‘ i have been working hard in training and i have scored a few goals there and that has given me confidence			0
you just need to go out on the pitch and keep doing right things			0
’ the @entity166 would n’t immediately spring to mind as an obvious backdrop for the salvation to start			1
@entity25 played in the @entity171 semi-final defeat to @entity172 in 2012 , the @entity174 loss to @entity175 the same year , as well as a semi-final reverse in the same competition to @entity178 the following season			1
but his memories of his last trip there provides a welcome analgesic to the pain that went before			0
the striker has not been in the best of form recently , but is likely to get another chance to prove himself ‘ probably , the ( @entity192 ) cup final against @entity193 ( in 2013 ) when i got man of the match , ’ he replied when asked of his favourite day on mount @entity190			1
‘ that was one of the highlights of the season for me because i had been out injured previously for five or six months			0
‘ to finish that way and on a high was massive for me because i had been out for so long			0
i did n’t know how i was going to come back			1
‘ when i first came back my ankle was still at me			1
so i was glad that was behind me and i showed i could still perform on the pitch			0
’ he did n’t score that day – a @entity207 double and @entity206 ’s goal completed the @entity208 for @entity209 – but there was much for him to savour			0
‘ yes , i had a couple of crosses for @entity52 and it was good to finish on a high , more so because of the injury because it had been a long season , ’ @entity25 recalled			1
‘ the injury had drained me a bit being out for so long and it had been the first time in my career that i had been out for more than a few weeks			0
’ assists are all very well , but a man who ’s known little more than life in the penalty box appreciates they are rarely the hard currency on which you are judged			0
‘ i would rather be in the middle scoring goals but it is difficult the way we play just now , ’ he added			0
‘ there is so much emphasis on getting back and defending and putting in the graft for the team			1
‘ i have been trying to adapt my game to that , as well			0
it has been a bit of a strange season for me			0
i actually do n’t mind playing on the left but you are never going to get the same plaudits as playing up front and scoring all the goals			1
‘ it is different because even when i played up front , i ’ve been on my own and i have always played in a two			0
i have just had to adjust			0
the main thing is the team			0
’ even if @entity25 plays and scores the goal to win the cup on sunday , it will be hard to view him as the identikit of @entity4 ’s ideal player			1
yet , notwithstanding the @entity19 episode , he believes he has now adjusted to the heightened demands of the @entity10			1
‘ the one thing about the gaffer is that our base for every game is our work rate , ’ he added			0
‘ it stems from there			0
the way we are playing is probably tactically a bit different from before			0
‘ there are n’t many spells when we keep possession for maybe 20 , 30 passes			0
it ’s always – get the ball , be direct , swarm them , break quickly			0
‘ but it seems to be working			0
it ’s something that was never just going to happen overnight			0
it just was n’t going to click			0
‘ i think there ’s been gradual progress throughout the season and i think we ’re getting there			0
‘ i just have to work hard and train as hard as i possibly can			0
i needed to give myself a lift , keep my fitness levels up and wait for an opportunity to get back in , which fortunately i have got			1
