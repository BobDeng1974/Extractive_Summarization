passengers may one day be able to hitch a ride on a plane with their thumb as carriers consider new ways to trim airport waiting times			2
despite privacy concerns and fears the data could be stolen by hackers , the parent company of @entity8 is testing a system that uses fingerprint scans to identify travellers with the goal of using it to speed up the process of getting from the check - in counter to the gate			1
if the ‘ e-thumb ’ system is implemented , the @entity22 - based airline would become the first in the @entity25 to use biometrics for things such as boarding passes , entry into airport lounges or in - flight purchases , @entity20 reported			1
@entity32 : @entity8 could become the first carrier in the @entity25 to use biometrics to identify travellers fingerprint scans could replace government - issued identification documents such as passports or driver ’s licences to reduce queues			1
@entity42 began using the technology , which uses human physical characteristics to identify a person , at a frequent flier lounge in @entity22 in august			1
the pilot project does not store images but uses an algorithm that converts reference points on a fingerprint into an encrypted code that can not reconstruct the original image , @entity20 reported			2
but the @entity54 said the technology poses significant risks for privacy and security , and could be vulnerable to hackers			1
under your thumb : fingerprint scans could be used as boarding passes or to gain access into an airport lounge the system faces a few hurdles before it can be implemented for commercial use			1
it must go through rigorous approval process and @entity42 must convince the @entity71 and other aviation authorities that the system can not be defeated and personal information will be kept safe and secure			1
@entity74 , @entity8 ’ managing director for customer research and development , told @entity20 : ‘ we ’re already in discussions of how we extend this , where we go next			0

the customer response has been that strong			0
we do n’t want to take our foot off the gas			0
’ @entity89 arrivals with biometric visas or biometric residence permits must submit to a fingerprint scan fingerprint scans are not unusual in airports			2
currently in the @entity89 , passengers with biometric visas or biometric residence permits must submit to a fingerprint scan when they arrive at passport control			0
a similar program is used in the @entity25			1
passengers who are flying between the @entity89 and @entity101 require a facial biometric image to verify their identity			0
in 2008 , the former @entity104 was forced to scrap plans to take fingerprints of passengers using @entity109 ’s @entity108 following warnings that such checks could be illegal			0
@entity104 had planned to fingerprint both domestic and international travellers transferring to domestic flights at @entity109			0
that same year , @entity114 began allowing passengers with luggage to board domestic flights with a scan of their index finger .			0

the ' e-thumb ' system could be used for boarding passes or lounge entry
@entity42 would be the first @entity25 carrier to use biometrics if it is implemented
airline says scans would speed up process from check - in counter to gate
@entity54 has concerns about safety and privacy
