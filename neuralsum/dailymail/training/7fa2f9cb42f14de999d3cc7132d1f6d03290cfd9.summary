neither are employed by the school anymore ' @entity5 is a business			1
it 's a business that sells sex			2
it 's a way to get clientele and to sexualize young people and turn them into lifelong clients , ' parent @entity39 told @entity44 in november			0
the unhappy parents then partnered with conservative legal group the @entity46 to petition for a new sex - ed curriculum			1
in the course of their fight with the school , the career histories of the @entity5 instructors were revealed and two of the teachers raised even more concerns to parents			1
one of the instructors teaches a ' pleasure ' workshop at a store called @entity62 in nearby @entity63 , which sells sex toys			2
