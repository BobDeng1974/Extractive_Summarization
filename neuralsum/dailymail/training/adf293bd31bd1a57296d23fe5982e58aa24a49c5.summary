by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 first minister @entity2 wants to hold a referendum on independence by autumn 2014 @entity3 could break away from the @entity6 within three years under plans unveiled today			1
@entity2 hopes to declare independence within 18 months of a ‘ yes ’ vote in the referendum due to be held in autumn 2014			1
a countdown to becoming a standalone nation would culminate with @entity3 @entity12 in march 2016			2
two months later an election to a new parliament would be held , with lawmakers chosen to draw up a new constitution , which could outlaw ‘ weapons of mass destruction ’ in @entity3			2
but critics said accused the ruling @entity20 of having ‘ hopelessly underestimated ’ the scale of creating a new country , renegotiating 14,000 international treaties and agreements			1
the @entity26 government launched its transition to an @entity28 today , claiming it would ensure a smooth transition to a new nation			0
deputy first minister @entity31 the paper ‘ provides the people of @entity3 with a clear road map as to how @entity3 would make the journey from a devolved system of government with the levers of power retained at @entity39 , to a nation in which the powers of our national @entity42 are complete and in which the people are sovereign ’			1
last week the @entity47 rebuffed attempts by the @entity20 to use a ‘ leading ’ question in the referendum , warning that asking voters ‘ do you agree that @entity3 should be an independent country ’ was designed to secure a yes vote			1
instead the question will be : ‘ should @entity3 be an independent country ? ’ ms @entity31 repeated her call for talks about the process of potential independence but the @entity39 has insisted there will be no pre-negotiation			2
the most recent poll put support for independence at 32 per cent , while opposition stood at 47 per cent			0
@entity3 secretary @entity63 , a @entity63 mp , accused the @entity64 of creating a distraction from substantive issues			0
mr @entity2 and deputy @entity31 , published the timetable for @entity3 becoming an independence nation but opponents accused them of underestimating the scale of the task he said : ‘ once again , they are devoting their energy to the picture - frame when they do n't have a painting to put in it			1
‘ we have n't even got a date for the referendum , let alone any detail on what independence would mean for people in areas like the economy , welfare , energy and financial services			0
‘ people in @entity3 appreciate the benefits of remaining part of the @entity6 family and that is why they remain strongly opposed to independence			2
’ @entity96 leader @entity95 added : ‘ the @entity20 have hopelessly underestimated the scale and complexity of this			1
they would have to negotiate over 14,000 international treaties , a currency , the division of assets , membership of @entity105 and the host of international organisations			0
‘ to say they will bang all this through in just 16 months is absurd			0
this will give most people in @entity3 the shivers and fuel suspicion that the @entity20 are just making it up as they go along			1
’ however , the @entity20 said the paper ‘ puts pressure ’ on the @entity118 campaign group , @entity117 , which includes the @entity63 , @entity119 and conservatives			0
@entity121 , an @entity122 on @entity26 's @entity123 , said : ‘ the no campaign so far has done nothing except say ' no ' to every positive thing that is proposed for @entity3 - that is why its support has slipped since the new year , and why we now require a swing of just over 7.5 per cent for @entity132 to move ahead in the polls			0
