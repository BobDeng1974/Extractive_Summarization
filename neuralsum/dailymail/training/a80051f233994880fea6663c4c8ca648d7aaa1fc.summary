‘ the remarks i made were supposed to be light - hearted views , and tongue - in - cheek			1
on reflection i clearly went too far			0
i regret the comments , and apologise unreservedly ’ , he said			0
mr @entity7 ’s apology , an acute embarrassment for @entity21 ’s favourite department store , came too late to prevent a furious response from the @entity4 embassy			1
and prospective customers – @entity4 is @entity1 ’s second biggest market and it is about to open a @entity4 website – took to @entity28 in their hundreds to accuse @entity1 of ‘ @entity4 bashing ’			1
but mr @entity7 was backed by @entity32 business leaders , with the head of the @entity34 describing @entity4 as ‘ living on borrowed time ’ , one economist branding @entity4 ‘ the sick man of the world ’ and a leading commentator accusing the @entity4 of being ‘ bone idle ’			1
mr @entity7 made the controversial remarks after visiting @entity42 earlier this week to pick up an international retail award			1
safely back on @entity32 soil , he told a conference in @entity46 on thursday evening that @entity4 was ‘ finished ’			1
‘ you get on the @entity48 from something i can only describe as the squalor pit of @entity10 , @entity51 , and you get off at a modern , forward - looking station [ @entity53 ] , ’ he said			1
‘ i have never been to a country more ill at ease … nothing works and worse , nobody cares about it			0
’ the 50 - year - old @entity60 graduate , who joined @entity1 from university 30 years ago , described the ‘ plastic ’ retail award given to the company in the @entity4 capital as ‘ frankly revolting ’ adding : ‘ every time i [ see it ] i shall think , “ @entity67 help @entity4 ”			1
’ he even said the food and drink in @entity46 was better than that he had been offered in @entity42			2
he described @entity51 in @entity42 as the ' squalor pit of @entity10 ' after visiting on the @entity48 @entity2 has spent his career at @entity1 , joining after graduating from @entity60 with a degree in @entity72 in 1985 - the same degree read by prime minster @entity74			1

@entity1 , which will not take any action against mr street , was forced into damage - limitation mode yesterday over fears of alienating @entity4 customers			1
one said on @entity28 : ‘ insulting your future customers ... interesting marketing strategy ’			0
the @entity4 embassy said : ‘ @entity4 is the fifth biggest economy in the world ... so obviously many foreign businesses do not seem to share mr street ’s view			1
’ @entity102 , of the @entity103 , said the attack was an example of ‘ a festering antagonism with the @entity4 and @entity4 from the @entity32			2
’ @entity108 grandee @entity107 said mr street ’s comments were ‘ very silly ’ and ‘ mindless ’			1
the high profile businessman and former lord mayor of london added : ‘ it ’s completely inappropriate for someone running a big company to do this			0
it does n’t matter whether the criticism is right or wrong			0
’ but mr street ’s comments struck a chord with some in the business community , who believe the 75 per cent tax on top earners introduced by @entity124 president @entity123 and the country ’s labour laws – including a 35 - hour week – have stunted the economy			1
the high tax regime has already sparked an exodus of business leaders and celebrities			0
@entity132 , director general of the @entity34 , said : ‘ foreign direct investment in @entity4 has fallen by more than 90 per cent since 2005			2
@entity123 ’s government has been a disaster			0
@entity4 is living on borrowed time			0
’ mr @entity132 cited the decision by @entity4 car giants @entity139 and @entity140 to expand production in @entity142 and cut jobs in @entity4 as further evidence of the country ’s malaise			2

there was also a chorus of protest from businesses and wealthy individuals who have condemned the tax - including film star @entity230 , who left the country in protest			0
mr @entity123 has made the decision to reverse pensions reform , meaning that most @entity4 people will retire at 60 , and many at an even younger age			1
the @entity4 government 's response to the economic crisis is the so - called ' @entity240 ' , a € 40bn ( £ 32bn ) package of tax breaks for business , financed with € 50bn in public spending cuts			2
but the plan has been the target of left - wing politicians for being too business - friendly and too austere at a time of economic crisis			0
