after the death of both of her parents and mr @entity7 in the space of three years while living in @entity1 , mrs @entity13 decided to return to @entity45 with her children so she would have the support of her late husband 's family			1

the @entity50 allowed mrs @entity13 to live in the @entity4 as long as her two children , who both hold @entity4 citizenship , remained in the country			2
in addition to the permit , mrs @entity13 chose to apply for a derivative residence card , which proves the holder has the right to live in the @entity4 as a primary carer and shows employers they are allowed to work here			1
she said she was desperate to be granted the derivative residence card because it would help her find employment in the @entity4			2
however , she recently got a letter from the @entity79 which said it had rejected her application and reviewed her case			0
officials said she had not proved she was the primary carer of her children and suggested that her 69 - year - old mother - in - law could care for @entity9 and @entity10 instead			1

i just do n't know what more i can do to prove it to them			0
' who on earth is going to leave without their children ? my little girl is only four , i 'm not going to leave her			0
' if i have to go i would have to take them back to @entity1 with me , but that would n't be what 's best for them			2
they 've just started settling in and making friends at school			0
' it will affect them if i have to leave			0
they 've already lost their father and now the government wants to take their mother away from them too			0

they have n't asked her or done any checks on her finances or health			0
' she works in @entity141 four days a week , she 's going to be 70 this year and she has an enlarged aorta so she has to watch her blood pressure			0
' there 's no way @entity146 would leave her children here , she 'd have to take them with her back to @entity1 , but then that 's denying their rights as @entity4 citizens			1
' the effect it would have on the children would just be devastating			0
‘ they love being over here with all the family , they just love it			0
‘ they are denying the children ’s right to a family life			2
' it should n't have to come to this and it has cost us so much money already			0

friends and family have also set up an online petition against the deportation mrs @entity13 is appealing the @entity79 decision but does n’t know when the case will be heard			2
she is appealing on the grounds that the decision fails to consider the best interests of her children and that it does n’t take into account her right to a family life under @entity189			2
she also claims the @entity79 decision fails to take into consideration the compassionate and exceptional circumstances which she has found herself in , and the fact she has been the children ’s primary carer since they were born			1
