by @entity0 @entity2 will be the best performing major economy in the developed world this year and will grow at nearly twice the pace of the @entity6 , a global financial watchdog declared last night			1
the @entity7 said it now expects output in the @entity2 to rise by 3.2 per cent in 2014 – leaving rival economies such as the @entity6 , @entity10 and @entity11 trailing in its wake			1
the @entity7 said @entity2 had delivered one of the few ‘ upside surprises ’ so far this year and warned that the global outlook has deteriorated			1
ministers said @entity2 is now ‘ in the fast lane of recovery ’ following the deepest slump in post-war history when the economy crashed by 7.2 per cent under @entity29			2
official figures published today look set to show that the @entity2 is now producing more than it was before the recession struck – bringing the longest downturn on record to an end			2
analysts expect the @entity38 to say gross domestic product increased by around 0.8 per cent between april and june – taking it past the pre-recession peak			0
@entity42 , an economist at @entity43 , said it ‘ would mark another milestone for the recovery ’			0
the latest forecasts from the @entity7 are another victory for @entity49 , who only 15 months ago was accused by its chief economist of ‘ playing with fire ’ by pressing ahead with austerity			1
the @entity7 has since admitted it was ‘ too pessimistic ’ about the @entity2 – and upgraded its forecasts for 2014 four times in the last nine months			1
it is a major boost for chancellor @entity49 who was last year warned by the @entity7 that he was ' playing with fire ' by pressing ahead with spending cuts this time last year it was predicting annual growth of only 1.5 per cent – less than half of what it now expects – and as recently as april pencilled in 2.9 per cent			1
the latest upgrade was the largest positive revision for any country in the @entity67 – which also includes the @entity6 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity70 – and the @entity72 economies of @entity73 , @entity24 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
the chancellor said : ‘ the @entity7 has upgraded their 2014 forecast for the @entity2 by more than any other major economy			1
‘ the government ’s long - term economic plan is working			0
but the job is not yet done and so we will go on making the assessment of what needs to be done to secure a brighter economic future			0
’ @entity87 said ‘ more growth means more jobs and more security for families ’			0
the @entity7 cut its global growth forecast for this year from 3.7 per cent to 3.4 per cent and warned of ‘ downside risks ’ – including in @entity24 and the @entity22			2
the @entity6 economy is expected to grow by 1.7 per cent this year , down from the 2.8 per cent expected in april , while the outlook for the eurozone was unchanged at 1.1 per cent			1
@entity29 's shadow chancellor @entity97 said it has taken two years longer than planned for the economy to return to pre-crash levels @entity7 chief economist @entity100 said : ‘ the recovery in the euro area remains weak and inflation is too low			1
’ @entity10 ’s economy is now expected to grow by 1.9 per cent this year , up from the 1.7 per cent expected in april			1
but the @entity7 cut its forecast for @entity11 from 1 per cent to 0.7 per cent			2
@entity24 ’s fragile economy is expected to all but grind to a halt this year as the crisis in @entity21 takes its toll			0
the @entity7 said the @entity24 economy will grow by only 0.2 per cent this year following expansion of 3.4 per cent in 2012 and 1.3 per cent last year			2
it also slashed its growth forecast for next year to only 1 per cent			0
@entity113 , head of economics and social policy at the @entity117 think - tank , said : ‘ the @entity7 is eating humble pie again			0
‘ @entity2 ’s economic plan to get the public finances in order has helped raise business confidence and assisted in restoring growth to the economy			2
‘ beating other major economies , these figures are a real coup for the chancellor			0
’ shadow chancellor @entity97 said that despite the recovery ‘ most people are worse off ’ and face ‘ a lost decade for living standards ’			0
@entity134 general secretary @entity133 said : ‘ pay packets are still falling behind rising prices , so most people are not yet sharing in the recovery			0
if the good news on growth is going to last , real wages must start improving too			0

@entity7 forecasts growth of 3.2 ***%*** in 2014 , *2.7* ***%*** in 2015
just a year ago the economic watchdog predicted growth of 1.5 ***%*** in 2014
puts @entity2 ahead of the @entity6 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70
figures *tomorrow* expected to show economy is back to pre-crash levels
