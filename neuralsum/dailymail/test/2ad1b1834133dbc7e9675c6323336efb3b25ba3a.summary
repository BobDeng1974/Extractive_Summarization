when rural farmer @entity1 and his wife @entity3 found a baby male kangaroo on the side of the road in 2013 , they had no idea that the little joey would quickly become part of their family			2
two years on , the curious and friendly joey they have dubbed ' @entity14 ' is now so comfortable living with the couple and their dogs @entity17 and @entity20 on their farm , near @entity23 in @entity24 , that the @entity25 's are convinced he actually thinks he is a dog too			1
@entity14 rides around the property in the back of mr @entity25 's truck along with the dogs , sleeps with them on a dog bed , eats with them , asks for scratches , and even tries to sneak dog treats when he can			1
' i loaded the dogs in and he was hanging around and looking up at the truck and so i just picked him up and put him in the back with them , ' mr @entity25 told @entity57			1
' i did n't think too much of it , we drove down and came back together , ' he said			0
' he 's been fine sitting on the back , as i do n't drive too fast because i 'd be worried about him jumping off			0
he does n't jump in , i lift him in and out			0
' while the adventure down to the dam has only happened a few times , @entity14 , who the couple often call ' @entity66 ' , has also picked up some very canine - like habits			2
' he 's either eating or sleeping			2
he 's a very placid creature , and every time you walk out the door if he 's not laying in his bed he comes up and wants a pat and a scratch , ' mr @entity25 said			1
' he even puts his arms up and wraps them around you like he 's giving you a cuddle , ' he said			0
and just like most dogs , while @entity14 gets along well with @entity17 and @entity20 , he does n't care much for the couple 's cat			1
@entity14 the kangaroo sleeps and eats with the dogs , and often tries to sneak their food as well as his own mr @entity25 said that @entity14 will hold his arms up and wrap them around like he is trying to give a cuddle ' he just likes to hang out with the dogs , probably because he thinks he 's a dog			1
he eats and sleeps with them , and will wander down to the shed with them and lay around if i 'm working there , ' mr @entity25 said			1
@entity14 also has a collar , like many dogs , as a protective measure to ensure he can be found at nighttime			0
' when he was little we used to let him out during the day and he 'd go off grazing and would n't come back at night , so we 'd have to go looking for him , ' mr @entity25 said			1
' we just could n't find him as kangaroos do n't make any noise and are very still , ' he said			0
' once we found him he would always come back with us , so we decided to wrap some reflective tape around a collar so when we shone a torch at night we could see him '			0
while mr @entity25 said that there are ' plenty of people around who look after orphaned joeys ' , their situation is a bit unusual			2
' in a rural area like this there are always kangaroos around who unfortunately get hit on the road and for various reasons orphaned joeys are found , and so we were n't sure when we took him home what would happen , ' he said			0
but by the time the couple had started to feed him , and weened him off milk , he was part of the clan			0
now , instead of milk , @entity14 eats a mixture of grains , and guinea pig / rabbit food , his favourite treats are an apple or bread			2
' although when we feed the dogs he often wants what they 're having , ' said mr @entity25			1
unsurprisingly for a joey who has convinced himself he 's one of the pups , he often tries to get some of the dog biscuits too .			0

@entity14 the kangaroo was *adopted* by the @entity25 family from @entity23
the two - year - old roo now believe 's he is one of the couple 's dogs
he rides around in the back of their truck , and sleeps and eats with them
@entity14 asks for scratches and tries to sneak dog treats when he can
mr @entity25 said that like any other dog , @entity14 is either eating or sleeping
