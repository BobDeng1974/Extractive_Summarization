by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 12:08 est , 29 october 2012 the unmanned @entity1 carrying a stash of precious medical samples from the @entity4 has parachuted into the @entity5 , completing the first official private shipment under a billion - dollar contract with @entity8			1
@entity10 - based company @entity9 successfully guided the @entity11 down from orbit to a splashdown a few hundred miles off the @entity10 coast			1
' this historic mission signifies the restoration of @entity20 's ability to deliver and return critical space station cargo , ' @entity15 , the billionaire founder and head of @entity9 , said			1
splashdown : @entity9 's dragon spacecraft returned to @entity28 from the @entity4 the @entity9 's dragon capsule is secured on a recovery boat , post-splashdown @entity8 administrator @entity31 praised the ' @entity20 ingenuity ' that made the mission possible			1
several hours earlier , astronauts aboard the @entity4 used a giant robot arm to release the commercial cargo ship 255 miles up			2
@entity9 provided updates of the journey back to @entity28 via @entity39			1
the supply ship brought back nearly 2,000lbs of science experiments and old station equipment			2
perhaps the most eagerly awaited cargo is nearly 500 frozen samples of blood and urine collected by station astronauts over the past year			2
@entity11 is the only delivery ship capable of returning items , now that @entity8 's shuttles are retired to museums			0
@entity52 made the last shuttle haul to and from the station in july 2011			0
@entity9 - more formally @entity9 - launched the capsule three weeks ago from @entity56 , full of groceries , clothes and other station supplies			1
ice cream as well as fresh apples were especially appreciated by the station residents , now back up to a full crew of six			0
it is the second dragon to return from the orbiting lab ; the first mission in may was a flight demo			0
this flight is the first of 12 deliveries under a 1.6 billion - dollar contract with @entity8			1
@entity9 's @entity72 after its release from the @entity4 ' it was nice while she was on board , ' space station commander @entity74 said as the @entity11 backed away			1
' we tamed her , took her home and , literally and figuratively , there 's a piece of us on that spacecraft going home to @entity28			0
' she added to the @entity9 flight controllers in @entity84 , @entity10 : ' @entity85 and thank you for her			2
' @entity11 was retrieved from the @entity5 and loaded on to a 100ft boat that will haul it to @entity89			0
from there , it will be transported to @entity91 , @entity92			0
the medical samples will be removed as quickly as possible , and turned over to @entity8 within 48 hours of splashdown , according to @entity9			2
everything else will wait for unloading in @entity91			0
a @entity97 supply ship , meanwhile , is set to blast off this week			0
it burns up upon descent , however , at mission 's end			0
so do the cargo vessels provided by @entity103 and @entity104			0
@entity9 is working to transform its @entity11 cargo craft into vessels that @entity20 astronauts could fly in another four or five years			2
until @entity9 or another @entity20 company is able to provide rides , @entity8 astronauts must rely on @entity97 rockets to get to and from the space station			1
