it has had repercussions for the man , including him having to be off work for four weeks and leave his own home			2
' this is a tragedy from everyone 's perspective			2
you are the author of that tragedy			0
' crown barrister @entity57 said @entity0 had a number of issues with his neighbour - all of which were found to be false			1
he said @entity0 had initially taken issue with a garden shed , first claiming it was being used to run a business , and then that it was used for breeding dogs			2
@entity68 officials became involved and advised the neighbour to contact the police			2
mr @entity0 was spoken to by a @entity71			2
a police special constable and told he was being unreasonable and appeared to understand			0
however , in the days before the stabbing mr @entity0 had appeared at his neighbour 's door and seemed ' very confrontational and wagging his finger ' saying he was going to the council about the washing machine			1
on april 11 , mr @entity0 had laid out pills in his house and written a suicide note before going to confront his neighbour			1
' the neighbour opened the door and asked him what it was about , ' said mr @entity57			0
' he appeared agitated and was asking him why the washing machine was on			1
he said it was not , and the neighbour tried to placate mr @entity0			1
' before he knew it , mr @entity0 had lunged at him - pushing him into his hall			1
he was grappling with him and trying to push him out of the house			0
' he then noticed @entity0 had a knife , which he had not seen before , as he had opened the door half asleep			1
mr @entity0 then began stabbing at him with his right hand towards his legs and stomach			1
' the neighbour described @entity0 as crazed			1
he feared for his life			0
he said he did not think he would have been able to stop mr @entity0 , if he had not put up such a struggle			2
' ( @entity0 ) kept saying : ' you are evil			2
you should not be here			0
' mr @entity57 added the pair had been grappling in the doorway when the knife blade broke during the struggle			0
a third party then intervened and pulled the pair apart			0

he now suffers flash backs and can not face living in his own home			0
@entity0 was sentenced to four - and - a - half - years for the frenzied attack when he appeared at @entity1 ( pictured ) yesterday defence barrister @entity127 said mr @entity0 was a hard working man who had been widowed and described by friends a proud gentleman who they could not believe was capable of such violence			1
he said at the time of the attack he suffered from psychosis and paraphrenia - a delusional mental health condition which can happen to elderly , widowed people who live on their own			0
mr @entity127 said the defence accepted there was never any noise from the washing machine , but it was described by a psychiatrist as an auditory hallucination			1
he said @entity0 had been married for 54 years but his wife died in 2008 and he had since lived on his own			2
sentencing judge @entity43 told @entity0 : ' there are a lot of elderly people who we all have experience of who have irrational thoughts , but what they do n't do is pick up a knife and go around to their neighbours and stabbing them in the early hours of the morning			1
' ' i have given you due weight to your psychosis and mental disorder you were suffering from at the time			0
had you been a younger man and not suffering from a mental disorder you would have been sentenced to very much longer			0
' this is a very usual and difficult case ' you are 82 years old			0
you have no previous convictions and you have led an exemplary life with responsible work and a happy marriage until your wife died in 2008			0
you now fall to be sentenced for a very serious crime which warrants a custodial sentence			0
' given your age that sentence will fall harder on you			0
you will be a vulnerable prisoner and the late - evening - of - your life will be spent in misery			0
you have ruined your own life			0
' @entity0 , who wore head phones to boost his hearing , smiled to his family in court before being led away to cells below court and a waiting prison van .			2
