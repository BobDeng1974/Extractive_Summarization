by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 13:12 est , 21 december 2012 a draconian crackdown on the public ’s right to know what the police are doing was demanded by @entity6			1
he called for a ban on the press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested			1
also , the ‘ off - the - record ’ briefing of journalists would be barred , and senior police officers would be expected to log details of any contact they have with reporters and make the details widely available			1
a string of major scandals have been uncovered over the years by unauthorised police sources who could in future be frightened to speak out			0
@entity6 said he had not found any extensive evidence of police corruption , and the scale of the problem of ‘ leaks ’ to reporters should be kept in proportion			1
he also downplayed the scale of so - called cosy relations between the police and journalists			1
just some of the stories that might never have come to light : a series of disclosures to @entity40 reporters propelled the @entity42 inquiry forward ; right , @entity43 embroiled in a race war the inquiry chairman said : ‘ no one could reasonably conclude that inappropriately lavish entertainment is or has been rife in the @entity48 or that the officers involved in what may be described as the most damaging evidence were corrupt			0
' the issue is about perception , more than integrity			0
’ but the report then went on to highlight a string of scenarios where contact between police and the @entity60 should be curtailed			1
he said it should be ‘ mandatory ’ for all officers of @entity67 rank – the most senior police – to record all of their contact with the media on a ‘ brief note ’ , explaining what the conversation was about			1
where the discussion involves a more ‘ significant ’ matter , the note must be more detailed			2
he also says senior staff must consider whether they need a press officer present			2
it also said that @entity67 guidance should ‘ more specifically spell out the dangers of consuming alcohol in a setting of casual hospitality ( without necessarily specifying a blanket ban ) ’			1
@entity6 ( left ) said it should be ' mandatory ' for all officers of @entity67 rank – the most senior police – to record all of their contact with the media on a ' brief note '			1
right , @entity48 police commissioner @entity87 the judge also wants far tighter controls on police taking journalists on operations such as raids – which provide a valuable insight to the public on how the police work – for fear of ‘ violating the private rights of individuals ’			1
the report goes on : ‘ i think that it should be made clear that save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances ( for example , where there may be an immediate risk to the public ) the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or public			1
’ the report suggested putting a 12 - month ‘ cooling off ’ period into contracts that would stop former senior police officers being employed by the press			1
last night , @entity119 of the @entity67 said it would need to consider the report ‘ carefully ’			2
he added : ‘ police should have a professional , open and transparent relationship with the public and the media			1
' the media can provide a vital role in communicating with the public , helping society to solve crime , and holding public institutions to account			1
’ mayor of london @entity130 , who is responsible for the @entity48 , rejected @entity6 ’s proposal for off - the - record briefings from the police to cease			1
‘ clearly briefings are going to remain an important part of public life , ’ he said			2
@entity6 doubtless thought he was helping to protect the innocent by calling for a ban on the identification of crime suspects who have been arrested but not charged			1
but , if the public do not know a person is being held in custody , how are they supposed to come forward with any information they hold which could clear them , such as a cast - iron alibi ? sweeping people off the streets and locking them up in secret is the hallmark of brutal totalitarian regimes , not mature democracies			2
equally chilling is the judge ’s demand that senior police must keep a log – freely available to their superiors – of any contact they have with journalists			1
@entity6 says he is acting in the interests of ‘ transparency ’			1
but , in reality , he risks creating a ‘ closed shop ’ in which police feel frightened of passing on information , even where it is of huge public interest , in case they are subject to a witch - hunt by officials who it suits to conceal inconvenient truths and restrict all communication to official channels			1
journalists will be treated , wrongly , as a potential enemy best avoided , despite the overwhelming majority of reporters being interested only in exposing wrongdoing , helping the police to bring criminals to justice and defending the public ’s right to know			2
scandal upon scandal has been exposed by unauthorised briefings to the @entity60 from police – not least the uncovering of the shocking failings in the original @entity42 investigation			0
@entity6 ’s report also suggested that journalists could in future be forced to identify whistleblowers to the police			1
currently , journalists have protection under the @entity202 from disclosing material to the police , even if it is obtained by a source acting in an unlawful way			2
but the judge says there should be a consultation on changing this rule			0
the danger is that good citizens desperate to expose wrongdoing will not come forward if they risk being named to the police and arrested			2
the computer disc which contained the details of how @entity217 had been rampantly fiddling their expenses was technically stolen by a @entity220 employee			0
how many guilty men will escape justice and how much corruption go undetected if the @entity225 plan is implemented in full ? six major stories that would never have been told by @entity227 unofficial police sources are behind some of the most important revelations of corruption and wrongdoing in modern times			2
some of the stories that might never have come to light without unauthorised briefing include : the @entity237 the inquiry into the racist murder of the black 18 - year - old lost its way it was off - the - record briefings that focused the minds of the country ’s top police officers			1
a series of disclosures to @entity40 reporters propelled the story into the public eye and led to a series of reviews and questions from the highest level of @entity255			0
almost 30 years later , perpetrators were finally convicted and @entity42 ’s family finally found justice			0
lord @entity262 the then sir @entity261 , now @entity6 , @entity260 occupied the office at the top of @entity43 , unauthorised disclosures raised serious questions about his stewardship			2
one exposed his dubious decision to secretly record telephone conversations with attorney general @entity269			0
another raised questions about a £ 3million it contract with @entity273 , a company owned by his long - term friend and skiing partner @entity274			0
when the then sir @entity261 , now @entity6 , @entity260 ( left ) occupied the office at the top of @entity43 , unauthorised disclosures raised serious questions about his stewardship			0
a foul - mouthed rant by then chief whip @entity280 ( right ) in september might never have become public had a police note of the encounter not been passed to the @entity60 , as there were no other witnesses @entity287 foul - mouthed rant by then chief whip @entity280 in september might never have become public had a police note of the encounter not been passed to the @entity60 , as there were no other witnesses			2
the ensuing scandal ultimately led to mr @entity280 ’s resignation			0
the @entity297 senior @entity295 police officer @entity294 was sent to @entity298 to head an inquiry into the shooting of @entity302 suspects by the @entity303 , he was subjected to an extraordinary smear campaign			0
he was suspended from duty , but junior officers privately briefed newspapers and the @entity308 about his treatment			0
all charges against him were dropped			0
@entity312 actions of the corrupt @entity43 commander were laid bare thanks to unauthorised leaks to the @entity40			0
information from unnamed colleagues led to intense scrutiny of his activities and eventually his conviction for perverting the course of justice			0
@entity325 four - year inquiry into corruption at the @entity327 and @entity48 forces might well have collapsed were it not for key off - the - record briefings			1
@entity332 and @entity333 officers were obstructed from the start and turned to the @entity60 to publicise their problems			0
the government responded by ordering the @entity43 to co-operate			0
legal update : in 2009 mr @entity338 complained about an article dealing with the award by the @entity48 of contracts to his former company , @entity273			0
he brought proceedings for libel and was successful			0
the @entity345 found , in december 2012 , that there were no reasonable grounds to suspect that mr @entity274 was a willing beneficiary of improper conduct and cronyism because of his friendship with sir @entity260 in respect of the award of a number of @entity48 contracts to @entity273 worth millions of pounds of public money			0
mr @entity274 was awarded £ 65,000 damages .			0
