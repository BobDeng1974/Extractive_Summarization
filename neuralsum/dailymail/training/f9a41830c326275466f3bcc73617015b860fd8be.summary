by @entity0 pilot mismanagement and confusion caused @entity4 to crash in @entity5 last year , federal accident investigators concluded today			1
the @entity6 said at a hearing in @entity8 today that there was confusion over whether one of the airliner 's key controls was maintaining speed			2
the agency also cited the complexity of the @entity19 's autothrottle and pilot training by the @entity21 - based airline as contributing to the crash , which killed three passengers and injured more than 200			1
its tail struck a seawall and was ripped off			0
the rest of plane went spinning and sliding down the runway			0
the crash was the only fatal passenger airline accident in the @entity41 in the last five years			1
before the vote , @entity42 , the @entity6 's acting chairman , said that increasingly complex automated aircraft controls designed to improve safety are instead creating new opportunities for error			2
the @entity49 flight crew ' over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand , ' he said			0
among the other issues raised by the investigation are some that long have concerned aviation officials , including hesitancy by some pilots to abort a landing when things go awry or to challenge a captain 's actions			2
the irony of the accident is that it occurred at all			2
three experienced pilots were in the cockpit on july 6 , 2013			0
@entity6 chairman @entity67 makes opening remarks during a hearing to establish the cause of the @entity4 ( pictured today ) the plane , a @entity19 , had one of the industry 's best safety records			1
and weather conditions that sunny day were near perfect			0
but the wide - bodied jetliner with 307 people on board was too low and too slow during the landing			0
it struck a seawall just short of the runway , ripping off the tail and sending the rest of the plane spinning and skidding down the runway			0
when the shattered plane came to rest , a fire erupted			0
the plane , a @entity91 777 , had one of the industry 's best safety records and weather conditions that sunny day were near perfect despite the violence of the crash , only three people were killed - @entity101 teens seated in the back who may not have been wearing their seatbelts and were thrown from the plane			1
one of the teenage girls survived the crash but was run over by two rescue vehicles in the chaos afterward			2
nearly 200 people were injured			1
in documents made public by the safety board , @entity49 acknowledged the likely cause of the accident was the crew 's failure to monitor and maintain the plane 's airspeed , and its failure to abort the landing when in trouble			1
the @entity21 - based airline said the pilot and co-pilot reasonably believed the automatic throttle would keep the plane flying fast enough to land safely , when in fact the auto throttle was effectively shut off after the pilot idled it to correct an unexplained climb earlier in the landing			1
@entity49 said the plane should have been designed so that the auto throttle would maintain the proper speed after the pilot put it in ' hold mode			2
' @entity91 had been warned about the problem by @entity41 and @entity139 aviation regulators			1
@entity49 urged the safety board to recommend that the aircraft maker be required to include an audible warning to alert pilots when the throttle changes to a setting in which it no longer is maintaining speed			0
' @entity49 has a point , ' said @entity149 , a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant , ' but this is not the first time it has happened			1
' any of these highly automated airplanes have these conditions that require special training and pilot awareness			1
according to reports the pilots of @entity4 were confused by the plane 's technology ( crash site from july 2013 pictured ) ' this is something that has been known for many years and trained for many years			1
' @entity91 told the board there was nothing wrong with the plane , and the crash was caused by the failure of the pilots to maintain speed and to abort the landing when the approach had become unstable , as required by their company 's policies			1
an unstable approach occurs when a plane 's speed or rate of descent is too fast or to slow , or the plane is n't properly aligned for landing			0
captain @entity183 , 45 , a veteran pilot who was new to the 777 , was flying the plane			0
because an airport navigational aid that helps planes land was n't working that day , @entity183 was flying a visual approach that involves lining up the jet for landing by looking through the windshield and using numerous other cues , rather than relying on a radio - based system called a glide - slope that guides aircraft to the runway			0
a training captain was sitting next to him in the right seat watching his performance			0
@entity183 told transportation accident investigators that he did not immediately move to abort the landing after it became unstable because he felt only the instructor pilot had that authority			1
cockpit culture in which the senior captain is viewed as supreme was identified as a factor in several @entity21 airliner crashes in the 1980s and ' 90s			0
afterward , procedures and hierarchies were overhauled in @entity21 and elsewhere , including the @entity41			2

complexity of the @entity19 's autothrottle and pilot training contributed to crash
three passengers were killed and more than 200 were injured
the crash was the only fatal passenger airline accident in the @entity41 in the last five years
