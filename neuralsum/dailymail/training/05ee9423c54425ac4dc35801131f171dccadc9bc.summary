by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 05:22 est , 28 october 2013 @entity2 's attorney general has asked for secret documents about the 1971 attica state prison riot to be unsealed in an attempt to reveal exactly what happened during the bloodiest prison rebellion in @entity9 history			1
@entity10 wants a court in @entity12 to open hundreds of detailed pages about the five - day riot which happened in september 1971 when inmates took control of the maximum - security prison in rural western @entity2 before state troopers and guards stormed the building and fatally shot 29 inmates and 10 hostages			1
@entity10 said it is time to bring transparency to what he referred to as one of the state government 's darkest chapters			1
riot : prison guard hostages and inmates gather in the exercise yard of cell block d inside @entity34 in @entity2 on september 9 , 1971 the sealed documents are part of a 1975 report that examined @entity2 's efforts to investigate the riot and its aftermath at @entity34			1
mr @entity10 said : ' it is important , both for families directly affected and for future generations , that these historical documents be made available so the public can have a better understanding of what happened and how we can prevent future tragedies			2
' he noted the historical significance and the fact that all related criminal and civil litigation has ended			0
after 40 years , he said , the privacy concerns can be addressed more narrowly by omitting only the names of many grand jury witnesses and some people identified in testimony			0
among those seeking the records are the @entity61 of @entity34 , a group of prison employees who survived and relatives of those who died			2
@entity66 , a lawyer representing the group , said this year : ' for families that lost their father , son , brother because they were killed in @entity72 , they yearn to know the truth of how their loved one died and why they died			1
inmates of @entity34 ( right ) negotiate with commissioner @entity77 ( lower left ) inside the jail where prisoners took control prison guards and @entity2 troopers gather outside @entity34 on september 13 , 1971 , after re-taking it from inmates who rioted for five days inmates wearing cloaks and football helmets stand behind bars in a corridor leading to d block on september 10 , 1971 , as they begin negotiations with @entity2 officials after the uprising at @entity34 ' some of that has come out , but certainly there 's a lot more that has n't come out			1
' eleven staff and 32 inmates died - all but four were shot by troopers and officers who fired hundreds of rounds in six minutes storming the prison 's @entity72 on september 13 , 1971			1
an additional 89 men were wounded			0
the inmates were demanding better conditions and amnesty for the riot itself			2
prison guards and @entity2 troopers gather outside @entity34 before they enter to re-take the maximum - security jail on september 13 , 1971 known as the @entity113 after the judge who headed the investigation , the 570 - page document was divided into volumes			1
the first with findings and recommendations was released but the others were sealed in 1981			0
published four years after the riot , the first volume said 62 inmates had been indicted for various offences , but the grand jury investigation should continue and consider all possible crimes by authorities			2
the original grand jury refused to indict in four cases brought against law enforcement personnel			0
one trooper was later indicted on a charge of reckless endangerment in 1975			0
the commission report emphasised ' important omissions ' in the evidence gathered by state police afterward and the possible conflict of interest with troopers investigating their fellow officers ' actions in retaking the prison			1
it found no intentional cover - up by prosecutors but faulted police for bad planning and failing to account for the rifles , shotguns and pistols used and bullets , slugs and buckshot fired by individual officers			1
governor @entity156 effectively ended official scrutiny of the uprising in 1976 when he pardoned seven inmates and barred disciplinary action against 20 of the troopers and prison guards among the hundreds of officers who retook the prison			1
he also reduced the murder sentence of inmate @entity165 , who was found guilty of beating guard @entity166 to death			0
the report concluded @entity166 and three inmates were killed by prisoners			0
@entity172 's request was filed late friday			0
it is n't clear when the judge will rule			0
in 2005 , the state reached a $ 12million settlement with survivors and families of prison staff caught in the uprising			1
about 150 claims were @entity182 followed a settlement for $ 8million five years earlier with 502 former inmates and families of those killed or injured , who claimed they were beaten , tortured and denied medical treatment after the prison was retaken			2
audiotapes published in 2011 showed president @entity189 offering support by phone to then governor @entity193 hours after the siege ended			0
' you did the right thing			0
it 's a tragedy that these poor fellows were shot but i just want you to know that 's my view and i 've told the troops around here that i back that right to the hilt , ' he said			0
while @entity193 initially praised the work of state police sharp shooters and called the retaking ' a beautiful operation ' a day later , he acknowledged ' a little problem ' â€” that most hostages were killed by gunfire , not by inmates as initially believed .			2
