by @entity0 published : 18:11 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 18:11 est , 2 january 2013 recovering : @entity1 , pictured on her 87th birthday , is recuperating at @entity3 when she was at the peak of her powers , the last place you would have expected to find @entity1 was in a luxury suite in a five - star hotel enjoying a well - earned rest			1
the former prime minister famously survived on only four hours sleep a night when she was in @entity12 and was deeply reluctant even to go on holiday			1
but since she was discharged from hospital last week , after minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder , @entity1 , 87 , has been quietly convalescing in a suite at @entity3 hotel in central @entity20			1
@entity21 is now increasingly frail and uncertain on her feet so there were fears she would not be able to manage the stairs at her elegant four - storey @entity27 home			1
the @entity3 has always been one of her favourite places and she has been invited to stay there for the forseeable future			1
staff have done their best to make it home from home and her two carers are taking it in turns to stay with her			2
@entity41 ’s first and only woman prime minister , who won three consecutive general elections , has been in fragile health since she suffered a series of minor strokes more than a decade ago			1
she suffers acute short - term memory loss			0
a close friend of @entity1 said : ‘ the operation was a complete success but it was physically very draining			1
it is much easier for @entity1 to recuperate and convalesce at the hotel			1
‘ @entity1 does n’t like a fuss being made of her but she is being pampered by all the staff			2
she went there straight from the hospital and no decision has been taken on how long she will stay there for			0
’ @entity1 , who was admitted to hospital five days before @entity59 , underwent ‘ minimally invasive ’ surgery			2
she had been due to spend christmas day with her niece , @entity61 , who lives in north - east @entity20			2
mrs @entity61 is the only daughter of her older sister , @entity62 , who died aged 83 in 2004			0
friends : former @entity65 spokesman sir @entity64 , left , and former @entity67 secretary @entity66 , right , will be among @entity1 's visitors the previous year she had @entity59 lunch with mrs @entity61 and her family because @entity1 ’s children , sir @entity71 and @entity72 , were both abroad			1
a small group of friends will take it in turns to visit @entity1 at the hotel			1
they include @entity81 mp @entity80 , former @entity67 secretary @entity66 , @entity82 , who was her foreign policy adviser at @entity12 , sir @entity64 who was her press secretary , and @entity83 , who was a senior editor at @entity84			0
@entity85 , nicknamed @entity86 , who was @entity1 ’s personal assistant in the @entity12 years , will also visit			2
another of her regular visitors is @entity89 , whose husband @entity90 , the former cabinet minister , was badly injured in the @entity92 bomb which killed his first wife @entity93 at the @entity94 in @entity95 in 1984			0
luxury : staff at @entity3 are ' pampering ' @entity1 sir @entity64 said : ‘ i find her better now than i have seen her in the last few years			1
‘ she always takes a lively interest in our conversation			0
she always wants to join in			0
sometimes she starts to speak and then the thought deserts her			0
but she can be very animated			0
she is one of the greats			0
’ @entity103 , who was chairman of the @entity81 , also makes a point of keeping in touch			0
shortly before @entity59 , @entity1 , accompanied by her carer @entity106 , had sunday afternoon tea with @entity103 and his wife @entity108 at their @entity110 home			1
