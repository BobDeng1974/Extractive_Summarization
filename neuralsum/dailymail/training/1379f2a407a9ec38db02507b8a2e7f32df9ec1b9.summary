by @entity0 anyone who has a fear of elevators may want to avoid the world ’s tallest building when it 's completed in four years ’ time			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity6 will feature the world ’s fastest double - decker elevator , capable of ascending and descending the mighty skyscraper at 32ft ( 10 metres ) a second			1
this lift will let visitors travel more than 2,165ft ( 660 metres ) in one go , so they can quickly climb the building that will measure an unprecedented 3,281ft ( 1km ) tall			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity6 , ( illustrated left ) will feature the world ’s fastest double - decker elevator that will ascend the mighty skyscraper at 32ft ( 10 metres ) a second when it is built			1
it will use @entity23 ( pictured right ) which is significantly lighter than conventional steel cable the shape of the tower is designed to reduce ' wind load ' which increases with height			0
its tapering wings are an aerodynamic shape to reduce structural loading due to wind			0
it is a similar shape to the @entity35 in @entity36 , which also has quite a stiff shape			0
the differing shapes at different levels mean wind loads will go around the building			2
one of the challenges is to build the tower so that it is not too rigid , but not too flexible so that it is unstable or people feel nauseous			0
another challenge for super tall buildings is the use of lifts and fire escapes , which in effect mean expensive unusable space			2
the challenge of pumping concrete so high up a single , pressurised pipe is a huge engineering undertaking			0
@entity57 , director of high - rise technology , at @entity59 , - the company that makes the lifts - told @entity62 that users should n't feel feel queasy on their speedy journey to the top of the tower			1
the most significant effect of shooting upwards or downwards at such a speed is that your ears can ' pop ' as inner and outer ear pressure levels need time to adjust			0
it is likely that some users will feel their ears readjust			0
' when travelling at speed in an elevator , the main factors to consider are vertical and lateral vibrations , noise and pressure change , ' a spokesman for @entity59 said			0
' in our latest lifts , we try and make sure that all of these elements are as balanced as possible to create a pleasurable elevator travel experience			2
' based on user research we know that 10 m / s is still at a comfortable level to travel , ' so users should not feel ill. a number of the elevators will be installed in the building			2
they will use ‘ high - tech carbon fibre cables and ‘ @entity98 ’ technology , which will one day enable elevators to travel up to 3,281ft ( 1,000m ) in one go			1
it is claimed the lightweight cable has the potential to transform skylines around the world , and by building upwards , will create living space for the world ’s burgeoning and increasingly urban population			1
the technology has been designed to match the strength of steel cables , while being much lighter			2
it is made of up to four bands of carbon fibre encased in a custom epoxy coating that increases friction and reduces slippage			1
the elevator ( illustrated in a gif ) will use high - tech carbon fibre cables			1
this so - called @entity98 technology means that lifts will one day be able to travel up to 3,281ft ( 1,000m ) in one go as buildings get taller , more steel cable has to be used to haul up the lifts – and lower them again safely			1
by uing conventional cable , architects are therefore limited at how high they can build			0
in a 1,640 feet ( 500m ) lift shaft , for example , up to three - quarters of the energy needed to move an elevator is expended on the weight on the cables themselves			1
this distance is considered the maximum that conventional cables can handle without snapping			0
weight and steel ’s limited ability to bend means the energy required to operate an elevator rises exponentially with height			2
the @entity145 company claims that its rope reduces the weight of the cabling by 90 per cent and consequently cuts energy requirements too			2
problem solving : engineers have to solve multiple problems to build the tower , from reducing the structure 's weight and making it sway the right amount , to piping concrete almost more than half a mile ( 1 km ) into the sky			0
artists ' impressions of the towering structure are pictured left and right centre piece : the skyscraper is intended to be the centre piece of the @entity168 development beside the @entity169 and will have 200 floors , 160 of which would be habitable			0
this is an image of what it might be like to look down from the structure the new cable was tested in the company ’s lab , located in a 1.90 feet ( 333m ) mine , and is designed to be resistant to wear and abrasion , reducing repair costs and the time spend out of service			0
it is one of the first details confirmed about the skyscraper			0
the construction of the world ’s tallest tower is underway and when it is completed in 2018 , it will have the world ’s fastest double - decker lifts as well as the highest elevator rise			1
the @entity7 will house offices , a hotel , apartments and a vertigo - inducing observation spot			2
in total , it will have 65 lifts and escalators , including seven double - decker lifts built by @entity59			1
the tower is the centre piece , and is the first construction phase of the @entity168 development , located along the @entity169 on the north side of @entity8			0
the cable has been designed to match the strength of steel cables while being much lighter			0
it is made of up to four bands of carbon fibre encased in a custom epoxy coating that increases friction and reduces slippage			1
it is shown in - situ on a pulley system the proposed tower is estimated to cost $ 1.23bn and would be 568ft ( 173metres ) taller than @entity36 's @entity35 tower , which is currently the world 's tallest building ( pictured )			1

the @entity7 will have the world ’s fastest double - decker elevator
visitors to the @entity6 building will travel 32ft ( 10 metres ) a second
made by a @entity145 firm , the lift will travel more than 2,165ft ( 660 metres )
it will use high - tech carbon fibre cables called @entity98 technology
lightweight cables mean lift shafts can be longer , and buildings taller
the 3,281ft ( 1km ) tall skyscraper is expected to be completed in 2018
