by @entity0 last updated at 3:55 pm on 7th february 2012 working hard and drinking hard is a reputation university students seem to thrive on - and @entity3 ’ son was no different			1
when @entity5 went up to @entity6 more than 140 years ago , his illustrious father made sure he would n’t go thirsty			1
in a letter the author posted to the 19 - year - old , he arranged for ‘ 3 @entity10 , 2 @entity11 and 3 @entity11 light claret to be sent down to you ’			1
not going thirsty : this letter from @entity3 to his son @entity15 promised the student copious amounts of alcohol , including ' 3 @entity10 , 2 @entity11 port and @entity21 light claret to be sent down to you ' a footnote added ‘ 6 bottles of brandy ’ were also on their way to complement his undergraduate lifestyle			1
while today ’s parents might show more concern about how much their children were drinking after leaving home for the first time , @entity3 did have some fatherly advice that remains universal today			0
no stranger to the shame of financial woes - his own father spent time in a debtor ’s prison - he sent a £ 250 annual allowance to his son , pointedly describing it as ‘ handsome for all your wants ’			1
he went on to warn : ‘ now , observe attentively			0
we must have no shadow of debt			0
square up everything whatsoever that it has been necessary to buy			0
helping hand : as well as the offer of alcohol and money , @entity3 offered a friend ear if problems arose , writing : ' if you ever find yourself on the verge of perplexity or difficulty , come to me ' ‘ let not a farthing be outstanding on any account , when we begin together with your allowance			2
be particular in the minutest detail			0
’ @entity3 , who had to leave school and work ten - hour days in a warehouse , was also keen to see @entity15 - the eighth of his ten children - understood the opportunity he was being given by studying at one of the world ’s greatest universities			1
‘ you know how hard i work for what i get , and i think you know that i never had money help from any human creature after i was a child , ’ he wrote in the letter , which was sent in october 1868			1
but he also offered a friendly ear if problems arose , warmly telling his son , whom he addressed as @entity84 : ‘ if you ever find yourself on the verge of perplexity or difficulty , come to me			0
‘ you will never find me hard with you while you are manly and truthful			0
’ the advice seems to have sunk in			0
after his first year @entity15 , a maths undergraduate , was awarded one of the principle scholarships at @entity90 , worth £ 50			1
years later , @entity15 described movingly how his normally reserved father had broken down in tears at the news of his award and told him : ‘ @entity95 bless you , my boy			1
’ sadly , @entity3 did n’t live to see whether his investment had paid off as he died in 1870 , aged 58			0
moving : @entity3 , left , was said to have broken down after hearing his son was given a scholarship following his first year at university , but sadly never lived to see if the investment paid off as he died in 1870 but his son did n’t let him down			2
@entity15 graduated in 1872 was later called to the bar after studying law at @entity6 as well			1
after 20 years in the @entity103 he became @entity104 , a senior judicial appointment at the @entity106 that he held until 1932			1
the anxious tone of @entity3 ’ letter is a reminder of the righteous anger the novelist felt about the grinding poverty and appalling conditions that working class people lived under - and which inspired much of his work , including @entity118 and @entity119			2
the hand - written note was given to @entity90 in the 1950s by one of @entity3 ’ great - great grandchildren and is held in the college ’s @entity123			0
it is rarely seen as it is only available to view by appointment but details were released to coincide with tomorrow 's 200th anniversary of the author ’s birth			2
dr @entity132 , an @entity133 at @entity6 , said : ' @entity3 rescued himself from a possible life of penury and crime by the tireless efforts of his own labour			2
' thanks to the brilliant productions of his prodigious genius , his own children were to enjoy a very different - and much more stable - childhood			0
