by @entity1 reporter an opera singer has claimed a military nurse carried out an unnecessary episiotomy on her during childbirth - leaving her with incontinence and flatulence so bad that she is unable to perform			1
@entity8 , 33 , alleges in a lawsuit filed against the government on monday that nurse - midwife @entity11 carried out the procedure without her consent and subsequently damaged her digestive and reproductive systems - as well as her singing career			1
the lawsuit filed by @entity8 and her husband , staff sgt. @entity17 , in @entity19 federal court seeks $ 2.5 million for negligence , as well as pain and suffering , embarrassment and loss of income			1
' she is suffering through a very embarrassing and very significant injury , and frankly , the prognosis of a fully successful repair is pretty low , ' her attorney , @entity25 , told @entity29 on wednesday			0
injuries : @entity8 was given an episiotomy without her consent while giving birth to her son in 2012			1
it left her with severe damage and incontinence that has threatened her opera career , she said the damage also means that she now suffers pain during sex , according to the lawsuit			1
as a result , her husband is also suing the government for lack of consortium			1
an episiotomy , which involves cutting the tissue between the vagina and anus , is carried out to help deliver the baby and when the skin is at danger of tearing			1
but mrs @entity8 claims that @entity11 carried out the procedure at @entity56 at @entity57 , @entity58 , in february 2012 without her consent			1
' at no time during the labor and delivery process was [ she ] informed about the possible need for or the risks and benefits of an episiotomy , ' the lawsuit says			0
' at no time was she asked to consent , nor did she consent , to the performance of an episiotomy			2
' nevertheless , birth records show that the procedure was carried out as the placement of the baby boy 's shoulder was holding back the delivery			1
the nurse then repaired the tear using sutures			0
family : mrs @entity8 and her husband @entity79 , who welcomed their first son in february 2012 , have now sued the @entity83 government for the allegedly botched procedure carried out by a military nurse an episiotomy is a surgical incision in the perineum , the area between the vagina and the anus , made just before childbirth to enlarge a woman 's vaginal opening			1
the procedure used to be routine to prevent the vagina from tearing , in the belief that this cut would help women heal easier than a spontaneous tear			1
cons research shows women with a spontaneous tear actually recover in the same or less time than women who have had an episiotomy			0
women who have had an episiotomy also tend to lose more blood during the delivery and experience more pain during their recovery			0
the tear also has a greater chance of becoming larger and research shows it increases the risk of tearing in a second birth			0
it also increases the risk of infection			0
the @entity120 and other experts now agree that the procedure should n't be done routinely			0
@entity123 but if a baby is very large or in an abnormal position and a doctor needs space for forceps , an episiotomy can be carried out			0
it can also help when the baby needs to be delivered as quickly as possible - if it is experiencing difficulties such as a drop in heart rate			0
mothers - to - be are encouraged to speak with their practitioner to find out in what conditions he or she would perform an episiotomy			1
midwives carry out the procedure much less than obstetricians			0
although @entity25 said that the placement of the boy 's shoulder probably led to the decision , he argued that they could have used other , safer ways to deliver the boy - but they did not			2
' there seemed to be an assumption that they did n’t need to involve the patient in the decision making ... and they were completely wrong , as a matter of law and social responsibility , ' @entity25 said			0
' the patient has a right to decide what ’s done with her body			0
' after @entity8 left the hospital , she ' began to experience fecal urgency and incontinence , including periodic leaking of stool and excessive flatulence , ' according to the lawsuit			1
at a follow - up hospital visit , she met with a nurse and ' complained she could feel gas coming out of her vagina and was also experiencing difficulty controlling bowel movements ' , the suit says			2
a nurse told @entity8 that the attempts to repair her incision had not worked			2
mrs @entity8 had suffered a ' complete breakdown of the episiotomy and perineum and the external sphincter is disrupted and the vagina and rectum are basically connected without any perineal body , ' the lawsuit claims			1
a colorectal surgeon at @entity191 later told @entity8 that she would need reconstructive surgery to repair the damage , but that it ' would likely not eliminate the lack of control of flatus and [ she ] may require additional surgeries in the future '			2
she was also told that once the repair was performed , she will have to undergo a c - section in any future pregnancies			2
when she told medical staff that c - sections could risk her singing career , they encouraged her not to undergo the procedure until she had finished having children , the suit says			2
mrs @entity8 agreed and has chosen to postpone the repair of the damage			1
a hospital spokesperson has not returned calls seeking comment			0
the lawsuit claims that @entity8 , a mezzo - soprano , is now unable to work as a professional opera singer			1
she has performed with the @entity216			0
' as a result of her incontinence and excessive flatulence , @entity8 has been unable to work as a professional opera singer , ' it says			1
scene : she gave birth to her son at @entity56			1
on follow - up visits , she learned that reconstructive surgery will not necessarily repair the damage , her lawsuit says it has also left her with limitations on her sexual function , as well as pain during sex , the suit states			2
online records also show that @entity8 has worked as a music instructor at @entity237 , where she received her master 's in music and vocal performance			0
her husband was a soldier at @entity57 on the @entity58 - @entity243 state line at the time but has since left the @entity29			2
under the concept of sovereign immunity , in which the government may not be sued without its permission for acts taken on behalf of it , most people have high legal hurdles to cross to bring a lawsuit			0
under @entity254 , the government has waived sovereign immunity if a tortious act of a federal employee causes damage .			0

@entity8 gave birth to her first child , a boy , in february 2012
nurse performed an episiotomy - where tissue is cut between the vagina and anus - ' without her consent and did not properly close the wound '
the procedure ' has left mrs @entity8 with severe damage to her *genitals* and flatulence and incontinence , which have left her unable to perform '
mrs @entity8 and her husband are suing the government for $ 2.5 million
