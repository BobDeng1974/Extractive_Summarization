shocking revelation : award - winning neuroscientist @entity1 , 58 , accidentally discovered that his brain bears striking similarities to those of serial killers while looking at pet scans for a study award - winning neuroscientist @entity1 was sitting in his office in october 2005 and rifling through @entity10 scans of people suffering from severe psychiatric disorders when he came across the image showing a psychopath 's brain - his own			1
@entity16 , a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at @entity19 , lived the first 58 years of his life thinking that he was a well - adjusted middle - aged man with a distinguished career in academia and a loving family			1
@entity16 had been raised by supportive parents , married his high school sweetheart , @entity25 , whom he had met at age 12 , and had three children			0
but then came that fateful afternoon in the fall of 2005 , when @entity16 learned a shocking truth about himself that would lead him to question his own identity			2
that day , @entity16 was going through thousands of brain scans as part of a research project on serial killers			1
‘ i was looking at many scans , scans of murderers mixed in with schizophrenics , depressives and other , normal brains , ’ he told @entity38 magazine			1
as chance would have it , around the same time the neuroscientist was also involved in an @entity49 ’s study as part of which he had done @entity10 scans of his own brain and the brains of his family			1
grey area : compared to a control brain ( top ) , @entity16 's brain ( bottom ) shows decreased activity in areas of the frontal lobe linked to empathy and morality - patterns that have been linked with psychopathy standout : brain imaging scans of @entity16 and his family reveal that only one ¿ the professor 's ( far right ) ¿ has large black areas indicating a low level of brain activity called orbital hypofrontality distinguished career : @entity16 is a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at @entity19 as he was reviewing the images in the @entity49 ’s project , he noticed one that was obviously pathological , showing low activity in parts of the brain responsible for empathy , morality and self - control – characteristics linked to criminal behavior			1
curious about the identity of the person whose brain was depicted in the scan , @entity16 looked up the code of the image and discovered to his astonishment that the psychopathic brain was his			2
journey of self - discovery : @entity16 wrote a new book called @entity103 seeking to explain how a happily married father of three could also be a psychopath rather than hiding the unsettling truth , professor @entity16 went public with it , delivering a @entity110 talk on the subject and sitting down to a lengthy interview with @entity113			1
the 58 - year - old neuroscientist has since penned a new book called @entity103 , in which @entity16 seeks to explain how a happily married father of three could also be a psychopath with the same genetic features that mass murders have been known to possess			1
‘ i ’ve never killed anybody , or raped anyone , ’ he said			0
‘ so the first thing i thought was that maybe my hypothesis was wrong , and that these brain areas are not reflective of psychopathy or murderous behavior			2
’ mr @entity1 then underwent a battery of genetic tests , which showed that he had an innate predisposition for aggression , violence and low empathy			1
what sets him apart from a @entity135 or a @entity136 , however , is that while he has difficulty feeling empathy for others , @entity16 does not act on his aggressive tendencies			2
in retrospect , the revelation that @entity16 had a lot in common with homicidal maniacs did not come as a complete surprise : the 58 - year - old professor happens to be a distant relative of at least seven alleged murderers			1
the scientist is related to @entity151 , who was hanged in 1673 for slaying his mother in the first case of matricide in the colonies , @entity19 's online magazine , @entity149 , reported			1
family history : the scientist is a distant cousin of @entity158 , who was acquitted in the grisly hatchet murders of her father and stepmother in 1892 mr @entity1 has an innate predisposition for aggression , violence and low empathy , but those qualities manifest themselves in him in extreme competitiveness and at times obnoxious antics @entity16 ’s other infamous kin is @entity158 , who was put on trial but acquitted in the grisly hatchet murders of her father and stepmother in 1892			1
‘ @entity173 's happy the killers are on my father 's side of the family , ’ @entity16 quipped to @entity149			2
it is hard to define exactly what makes a person a psychopath			2
in fact , psychopathy has such a wide variety of symptoms that it does not even appear in the @entity186			0
@entity16 believes that thanks in large part to his upbringing and support from his extended family , he has been able to channel and damp down his innate psychopathic leanings			0
‘ i ’m obnoxiously competitive			0
i wo n’t let my grandchildren win games			0
i ’m kind of an a * * hole , and i do jerky things that piss people off , ’ he admitted			0
‘ but while i ’m aggressive , my aggression is sublimated			0
i ’d rather beat someone in an argument than beat them up			0
’ according to @entity16 's theory , his ability not to act on his psychopathy is rooted in the unconditional love that his parents had given him			0
family matters : @entity16 had been raised by supportive parents , married his high school sweetheart , @entity25 ( pictured ) , who he had met at age 12 , and had three children secret of his success : @entity16 's theory is that his ability not to act on his psychopathy is rooted in the unconditional love that his parents had given him , steering him away from a dangerous path the 58 - year - old explained that his mother had had several miscarriages before finally welcoming him into the world , so to his parents he was a golden boy who was dotted upon			1
‘ i had a charmed childhood ; i was never abused			0
no one 's done anything bad enough to turn me into a killer , ’ he said			0
‘ it shows that your genes are not a jail sentence			0
’ around the time puberty hit , @entity16 's parents noticed that the boy was starting to show some unsettling traits , and so the family rallied around him , he told @entity113 , steering the troubled adolescent away from a perilous path that potentially could have led him to an early grave or a prison cell			0
in the wake of the stunting revelation about his genetic makeup , @entity16 has been consciously altering his behavior and making efforts to think about other people 's feelings - something that does not come naturally to him .			2

@entity19 professor @entity1 , 58 , made the discovery in 2005 while going though @entity10 scans of serial killers
areas of his brain linked to empathy , morality and self - control are *inactive* like in brains of murderers
he is distant relative of @entity158 , who was acquitted of murdering her father and stepmother with a hatchet in 1892
other relative is @entity151 who became the first person in @entity267 colonies to be hanged for killing his mother in 1672
