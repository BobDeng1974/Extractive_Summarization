@entity4 up with the morning commute on the roads of @entity3 , an internet entrepreneur has come up with a novel way of getting to the office			1
@entity7 has taken advantage of the fact that the city has more canals than @entity12 and is paddling his way to work			1
the 23 - year - old takes 40 minutes to cover the two - mile distance through the heart of the city , avoiding the busy traffic and not having to put up with public transport			1
@entity7 paddles his kayak two - miles to his office in @entity3 every day he gets some funny looks as he walks through town with his 8ft craft but people are getting used to it now each morning , mr @entity7 carries his 8ft kayak through the @entity27 to the @entity28 to work at his dating website			1
he said : ' every morning other people heading off to work have a good laugh at me as i walk down the street with my kayak under my arm			2
' but those looks quickly turn to admiration from the walkers and cyclists when they see me kayaking down the canal			0
' walking or cycling the canals simply does not compare to kayaking in terms of how enjoyable an experience it is			0
' all day i 'm usually on my phone or answering emails , but on the kayak it 's total switch - off time			2
luckily for me i have n't fallen in yet			0
' mr @entity7 explained how he originally came up with the idea to take to the water while on his way to work at @entity55			2
mr @entity7 says he likes to set himself a different challenge every month and for august he wants to kayak to work he said that kayaking the route is better than walking or cycling and it gives him time to switch off ' i live by challenging myself to do something new each and every month for 30 days , ' said mr @entity7			1
' this ranges from 30 days of mediation , to learning @entity65 for this time to eating meat - despite me being a veggie			0
' so a month ago i was looking for my latest challenge and decided that travelling to work by kayak would be the perfect new thing for me to do			0
' the @entity73 network is 100 miles long in total , while @entity12 has just 26 - miles			0
however , the number of canals in @entity3 is down from its 18th century heyday , when 174 - miles of canal were in operation during @entity81 's @entity80 .			1

two - mile journey takes @entity7 40 minutes in his kayak
