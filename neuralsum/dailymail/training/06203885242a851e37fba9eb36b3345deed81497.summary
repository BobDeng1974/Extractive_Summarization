by @entity1 reporter published : 19:59 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 19:59 est , 29 november 2012 more than 30 years after @entity4 's murder conviction was overturned he still sits in a @entity6 prison because two courts ca n't agree on what to do with him			1
a federal appeals court claims the 56 - year - old is being illegally held since his conviction was overturned in 1983 and ordered a retrial , but the state argues otherwise , leaving both unsure what to do with his case			1
this spat between the @entity18 and state attorney general 's office promises without found agreement a new series of legal proceedings potentially dragged out even longer before he could finally face trial			2
stuck : @entity4 has remained behind bars for the last three decades despite his murder conviction 's overturn in 1983 by a @entity6 court of appeals , pictured he ’s ' stuck , ' according to his federal public defender , with @entity4 arguing his constitutional right to a speedy trial have been violated with the state failing to retry him while also not setting him free			1
' it 's one of those one - in - a - million deals , ' @entity33 said of his client 's imprisonment			0
' when you see it , it 's kind of breath taking			0
' @entity4 was 21 when he was convicted in the gruesome 1976 slaying of a 55 - year - old ticket agent at a bus station in @entity44			1
@entity45 was beaten with a pickaxe and her body left in a bus station storeroom , where her 19 - year - old daughter found it			1
waiting : after @entity4 's conviction was overturned , ordering a retrial in 1980 , he 's sat in a @entity6 federal prison waiting for that date which has still not come @entity4 was convicted and sentenced to die , but in 1980 , a @entity6 appeals court ordered a new trial , saying a potential juror had been wrongly excluded from the original trial because of her reservations about imposing the death penalty			1
naming a previous case as an example of @entity4 's situation , his appeal states that the order for retrial ' only affected the sentence and not the determination of guilty			1
nonetheless , @entity6 law at that time required an entirely new trial in such circumstances			0
' eleven days later , then gov. @entity74 commuted @entity4 's death sentence to life in prison			2
at that point , both sides let the case lie for about 20 years			0
on wednesday a federal appeals court sent his case back to the @entity18 asking they define the status of its ruling overturning @entity4 ’s conviction			1
if the @entity6 appeals court accepts the federal appeals court 's request , it could set off a new series of legal proceedings that ties up the attorney general 's office and drags out the case			2
state attorneys twice requested a rehearing on the appeals court ’s decision , with the court rejecting their second request on march 4 , 1983			1
@entity4 , described in court documents as illiterate and mentally impaired with an iq of 51 , got the ball rolling again in 2006 , when he filed a handwritten writ of habeas corpus with the help of another inmate			1
the writ essentially said he should be retried or set free			0
it was rejected twice by the @entity18 before @entity4 submitted it in the federal court system			2
a judge there agreed with him			0
' @entity4 's position is as straightforward and subtle as a freight train , ' @entity113 district judge @entity112 said			2
the state had claimed that @entity4 was legally serving the life sentence ordered by @entity74			2
it said he had had one year under federal rules to file an appeal on any aspect of his case , and that year started when the retrial was ordered in 1983			2
@entity112 disagreed , saying the clock on an appeal does n't start until there 's a conviction , and none exists in this case			0
' the court 's mandate was never recalled , its decision never overturned , the conviction never reinstated ; yet @entity4 never received the ` entirely new trial ' ordered by the court , ' he wrote			1
the state 's appeal of @entity112 ' decision eventually ended up before a three - judge panel of the 5th @entity140 , which described the state 's defense of @entity4 's incarceration as ' disturbingly unprofessional ' in its wednesday decision			0
the panel had said in october that it could n't make a formal decision on @entity4 's complaint that his constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated because the issue had n't been resolved yet by his state trial court in @entity152 , about 60 miles southwest of @entity153			1
but the federal appeals judges left little doubt about their position , saying the state appeals court reversal 30 years ago meant ' there was no longer a death sentence to commute , and thus the governor 's order could not have had any effect			0
' the state 's request for a rehearing on that decision led to wednesday 's ruling			0
@entity4 , who is originally from @entity168 , @entity169 , has been moved to a @entity6 prison hospital for an undisclosed illness and was not available for an interview			0
@entity33 said he 'd discussed the court activity with @entity174 but found it useless to write him			0
' because he ca n't read it , ' he said .			0
