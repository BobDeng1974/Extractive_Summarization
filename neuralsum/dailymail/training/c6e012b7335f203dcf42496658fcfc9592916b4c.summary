by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:40 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 20:48 est , 20 november 2012 appeal : @entity4 @entity3 tried to keep his name secret during an @entity7 appeal hearing as his lawyers claimed to reveal his identity would infringe his human rights , it has been revealed @entity3 is engulfed in a privacy scandal as it emerged today he fought to keep his membership of a tax - avoidance scheme secret claiming unmasking him would ' infringe ' his human rights			1
the former radio 1 breakfast show host , who earned a £ 500,000 annual salary until he left his job in september , asked a tax tribunal to grant him anonymity in his battle with @entity7			1
mr @entity3 was a member of a ' marketed tax - avoidance scheme ' which @entity7 said did not work , but the broadcaster appealed that decision and asked that the press and public be prevented from knowing the case involved him			1
usually that appeal would be heard in public but the legal team acting for the self - appointed ' saviour of @entity32 ' argued he was ' fearful ' his career would be damaged should be be exposed as an aggressive tax - avoider			1
but the judge considering the case dismissed his plea saying there was ' obvious public interest ' in naming him adding the rich and famous should be treated like everyone else			1
' if it were to become public knowledge that he availed himself of a tax - avoidance scheme , his career might be damaged and his earning capacity reduced , ' judge @entity43 said when summarising the @entity4 's arguments			1
' he is already the focus of media interest for other reasons , much of it hostile , ' he added			0
at the heart of the @entity4 's claim to be protected was that ' adverse media comment ' would deny him the ' right to respect for his private and family life ' but judge @entity43 disagreed , adding : ' the fact that a taxpayer is rich , or that he is in the public eye , does not seem to me to dictate a different approach			1
' on the contrary , it may be that hearing the appeal of such a person in private would give rise to the suspicion that riches or fame can buy anonymity , and protection from the scrutiny which others can not avoid			0
' exit : after years on the radio 1 breakfast show @entity3 , 38 , left in september but says his career would be damaged if he was revealed to be involved in the @entity7 appeal case in spite of his ruling , at @entity80 ’s @entity79 in july , judge @entity43 made it clear that @entity7 did not claim that @entity3 had behaved unlawfully			1
the @entity82 said yesterday it established that the man referred to as ' mr a ' in the court papers was @entity3			0
the @entity86 has been widely criticised for allowing staff to be paid ' off the books ' with at least 120 stars earning more than £ 150,000 being paid in this way			2
it is not clear , however , if mr @entity3 has funnelled his @entity86 earnings via a tax avoidance scheme but the corporation confirmed he is still under contract with them			2
avoidance : it comes just months after it was revealed that @entity99 was paying as little as 1 % tax via a scheme @entity86 rules say that their staff must pay ' an appropriate amount of tax ' and a spokesman added that aggressive tax avoidance would ' very likely ' break those rules			2
in some cases this could lead to disciplinary proceedings and even get the sack			0
@entity112 has attempted to contact my @entity3 's representatives but they have not responded			0
his claim for anonymity is just another attempt for the rich and powerful to avoid open justice , @entity115 , one of @entity117 's leading privacy lawyers has said			2
he added he was astonished mr @entity3 had been advised to seek a gagging order in these circumstances			0
' he has effectively made worse a situation which was already bad			0
for the last five years the courts have provided people in the public eye with a degree of privacy , but many judges are now looking much more rigorously at whether privacy is genuinely needed , ' he told @entity82			0
' if there ’s some measure of public interest , as there would be in this case , the courts are starting to re- apply principles of open justice			0
' in june comedian @entity99 – who in the past had publicly mocked tax avoidance – was revealed as one of thousands of people using a legal off - shore scheme to pay as little as 1 per cent income tax			1
he is believed to have been the largest beneficiary of the @entity147 accountancy arrangement , said to shelter £ 168million a year from the taxman			1
he put away £ 3.3million a year via the @entity147 tax scheme , it was claimed			2
@entity147 works by transferring salaries into a @entity153 - based trust , which lends investors back the money			0
because the loan can technically be recalled , it is not subject to income tax .			0
