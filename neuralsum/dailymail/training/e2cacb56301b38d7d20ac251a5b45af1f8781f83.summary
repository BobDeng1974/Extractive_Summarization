by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 8 october 2013 after a year posing for photographs at tourist spots around the world , @entity2 the skeleton is doubtless looking forward to resting her bones			1
since owner @entity9 first came up with her plan to take pictures of the bag of bones every day for a year last @entity14 , the 42lb medical skeleton has visited the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
and while the project may now be about to draw to a close , @entity2 and @entity9 , 57 , still have @entity22 and @entity23 to tick off their list			1
@entity26 : @entity9 ( right ) and her skeleton @entity2 ( left ) pictured at the great gladiatorial arena in @entity18 @entity29 : @entity2 dresses up as the great roman emperor and is flanked by legionaries at the @entity26 queen of the @entity33 : @entity2 takes a romantic ride in one of @entity16 's famous gondolas the city that never sleeps : @entity2 appeared to be slightly overwhelmed when she arrived in bustling @entity19 @entity39 : @entity2 tucks in to a pretzel during a well - earned break on her round the world trip well earned pint : @entity2 donned traditional @entity47 dress and posed for a picture drinking a pint of lager the pair set out on their jaunt on november 1 last year - the traditional @entity54			1
@entity2 was seated in the passenger seat of @entity9 's car , a decision that was not lost on other motorists , who showed their appreciation by sounding their horns			2
as well as a trip to the @entity62 in @entity19 , @entity2 was treated to a tour of the @entity26 in @entity18 , and even had a ride on one of @entity16 's romantic gondolas			2
when the project comes to an end this month @entity9 plans to retire @entity2 to her studio as she has now become part of the family			1
strange customs : @entity2 has to fly ' over sized ' and it has proved tricky getting her through airport security park life : after the hustle and bustle of the city , @entity2 takes a stroll through @entity19 's @entity81 not shy : @entity2 persuaded this young couple to appear alongside her in one of the snaps for the album spooky plan : @entity9 ( right ) came up with the idea for the photographic project last @entity14 she hopes to get another , slightly lighter skeleton to take on future trips			1
@entity9 , from @entity92 in @entity93 , first became interested in bones 30 years ago when she worked on medical illustrations			2
she said : ' @entity2 is 42lbs and if i carry her in my arms i get bruises everywhere			0
' she flies over sized , which is hard getting through airports			0
she got held up by the @entity101 in @entity102 because they had to make she was not real bone			0
' the only day i had to take pictures when we were in @entity19 was a cold , rainy , windy day			0
carrying her across the @entity106 was no easy task			0
' most of my friends have been tremendously supportive			0
they give me and @entity2 lots of skeleton gifts and some have opened their closets and shared interesting bits of wardrobe			0
' lazy bones : @entity2 is pictured wearing sunglasses and lying on an inflatable rubber ring in a swimming pool connected to fellow tourists : @entity2 enjoyed a taste of the @entity121 , wearing a @entity123 hat and posing with other travellers road to hell : @entity2 certainly caught the attention of other motorists , who tooted their horns in appreciation ball game : @entity2 even managed to take in a baseball game when she paid a visit to the @entity134 , @entity135 the beginning : it is not known as the @entity93 for nothing , as @entity2 the skeleton 's exploits prove			2

for ' @entity2 ' the skeleton , life really began after death
medical model *accompanies* owner @entity9 wherever she goes
@entity149 photographic project began on last year 's @entity54
when *odyssey* finishes next month , @entity2 will be able to rest in peace
