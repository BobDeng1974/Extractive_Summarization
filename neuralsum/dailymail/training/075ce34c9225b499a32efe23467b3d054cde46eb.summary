last week the @entity0 – one of the culinary world 's most prestigious honours – were announced			1
the list held few surprises , with the top ten restaurants largely unchanged from last year , and once more the list featured strikingly few women			2
of the top 50 restaurants in the world , only three had a female head chef or owner and no restaurant on the list had a solo female head chef , with each of the female chefs working with a male partner – their husband , boyfriend , or father			1
@entity22 is the head chef at @entity23 in @entity24 , which was the highest - ranked restaurant in the world run by a woman the highest - ranked restaurant run by a woman is @entity22 , in @entity30 , which was named eighth best in the world , and is jointly managed by @entity22 , 44 , and her father @entity32			1
ms @entity22 said that her success comes from growing up in a society where women were encouraged to reach the highest professional echelons			2
' we are a matriarchal society where the woman has always been very strong			0
so i grew up in a society … where being a woman chef is normal , ' said ms @entity22			1
' for example my grandmother was a chef , my great - grandmother as well ... in @entity23 , 80 percent of the staff are women , ' she said			0
ms @entity22 acknowledges that these figures are unusual and says that when she worked at restaurants in @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 , she was often the only woman working in the kitchen			1
according to a study of @entity55 restaurants by @entity56 , women make up only six percent of head chef positions at restaurants			2
when that figure is expanded to include chefs as well as head cooks , the figure increased to only 19 percent , less than female ceos , of which there are 24 percent , according to the @entity66			1
@entity22 , 44 , runs the restaurant with her father , 72 - year - old @entity68			1
she began working in the @entity22 kitchen at the age of 11 the dishes that made her famous : some of @entity22 's creations : @entity73 ( left ) and @entity74 ( right ) it was this lack of female chefs in professional kitchens that led to the creation of a new award in 2011 , which is voted on by the same 900 panellists who choose the top 50 restaurants – the @entity84 's @entity83			1
' professional kitchens very much remain a male - dominated world and we think that balance should be rectified where possible , ' said @entity90 , @entity91 of the awards			1
' one of the ways of doing that is by celebrating those female chefs who have been and are successful with a view to inspiring the next generation of young women to follow them into that profession			0
' the award has come under fire for being unnecessary and patronising to women , criticism that mr @entity90 is well aware of			0
' in theory , one should n't need an award that separates out female chefs from male chefs , if we lived in a world of equality that would n't be necessary … but as it is , the vast majority of chefs are men			1
that will hopefully not be the case generations down the line , but while that is the case , we 're taking some positive action to go a small way to rectifying that			0
' the winner of the award this year was 35 - year - old @entity124 , who runs @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 , which was ranked 36th in the world , with husband @entity129			1
@entity124 runs @entity125 in @entity126 with her husband @entity129 and was awarded @entity132 's @entity131 at this year 's awards ' working in the kitchen is as hard for men as it is for women			1
the long hours , the heat of the kitchen , the cuts , the burns , the weekend shifts			0
to be in this profession you have to give up many other things , ' she said			0
however , ms @entity124 does think the @entity146 is a helpful step in rectifying the gender disparity in the industry			0
' i hope [ it ] makes the gastronomic world open its eyes to the work of more female chefs , ' she said			1
ms @entity124 , who was a model and an architect before taking up professional cooking , met her husband while they were both working at @entity161 in @entity30			2
the pair have run @entity125 together since 2006			2
having a supportive partner seems to be crucial to the success of female chefs			0
@entity22 , who won the @entity167 prize in 2012 , is married to @entity168 , an architect , with whom she has two children – @entity170 , nine , and @entity171 , seven			0
she says her husband is very involved with raising the children , who see more of their father than they do of her			0
' as long as they see you are happy , they are happy … i think it 's very important to be positive and set an example , ' said ms @entity22			2
' i do n't want to say it 's easy			0
it 's not easy ; nothing is easy in life if you want to work hard			0
' but she is hopeful that ' little by little ' things will change and awards like the @entity83 will no longer be necessary as the culinary world stops taking such notice of gender			0
' as a woman i am quite feminine ; but when i cook no one notices , ' said ms @entity22			2
