he famously played the instrument to rouse his troops after recovering from an injury he sustained in the operation , he further raised his profile by leading troops through @entity152 and then the landings in @entity154			2
it was here that , with the help of a corporal , he captured 42 @entity4 troops and a mortar crew with just the use of his @entity26			2
but on a later assignment in @entity163 in 1944 , he and his troops were struck by a @entity4 attack and he was sent to the notorious @entity166 concentration camp			0
