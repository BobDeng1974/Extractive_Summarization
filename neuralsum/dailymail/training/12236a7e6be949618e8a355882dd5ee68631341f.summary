@entity0 is already @entity1 - even though the big event is n't until may			1
the @entity4 girl , a @entity5 fan since birth , started a @entity8 campaign to have her favorite player , linebacker @entity9 , be her date for the big night , figuring she 'd ' give it a shot '			1
the 16 - year - year - old sent the @entity15 player a direct message on @entity17 , asking whether he would take her to her junior prom if she got 2,000 retweets			1
@entity9 replied within an hour			2
' i raised the bar and i said , '' if you get 10,000 , you got a deal '' , ' he later told @entity24			2
' no way ! ' an overwhelmed @entity0 , 16 , cries with shock as @entity5 linebacker @entity27 , 24 , arrives at her school in @entity29 , @entity4 , last week date night : after a social media campaign went her way , @entity0 is now going to her junior prom with @entity9 , who had a special @entity5 jersey made up for his date miss @entity0 amassed 15,000 retweets in three hours			1
' after that , i said , '' ok , i 'm going to prom and how can i make this an extremely special event for her ? '' @entity9 said			1
so last friday , 24 - year - old @entity9 traveled from the @entity40 - where attends graduate school when he 's not playing for the @entity5 - to @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity4 , where @entity0 attends			1
' i saw him and at first it did n't register all the way , ' @entity0 told @entity24			2
' then i realized it was him			0
i was shocked and overwhelmed			0
he did n't know what to say at first because i was crying , but he actually did say , '' will you go to prom with me ? '' and in case @entity0 did n't know why he was there , @entity9 was armed with a specially - made @entity5 jersey that said ' prom ' on the back			1
shock : @entity9 was just as surprised to see the student amass so many retweets in such a short time after dealing with the shock , @entity0 is now madly searching for a dress in the signature @entity5 shade of green			1
@entity9 , of course , will be in a tuxedo with a green bow tie for the may 9 prom			1
he is also trying to think of ways to make the night even more special			0
' i am trying to figure out where to buy a corsage , ' he told @entity24 , laughing			0
' i 've gotten offers from different car services but , yeah , i also play a little piano and sing			0
' we 'll see if i have a special musical performance			0
' the gesture also seems to have had as much of an affect on @entity77 as it has on @entity78			0
' saying it was humbling is so cliché , ' @entity9 said			2
' it 's a very heartwarming feeling because i never realize the impact i have on other people until that moment			0
when i saw her cry , i truly realized that i play a big impact on people 's lives			0
