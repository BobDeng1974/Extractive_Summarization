by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 06:57 est , 3 march 2014 as one of the best viola players in the world , @entity2 has performed with @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
married to famous conductor , @entity9 , and with four children privately educated at @entity11 and @entity12 , mrs @entity2 lives with her family in a £ 3million , six - bedroom house in the @entity16 countryside			1
but now the 57 - year - old classical musician has been forced by a @entity19 ruling to sell her £ 400,000 antique viola to pay off loans after a lengthy legal dispute over what was a £ 16,000 builder 's bill			1
@entity2 , 57 , has been forced to sell her rare viola to pay legal bills arising from a dispute with builders musical instrument dealer @entity29 , left , lent mrs @entity2 - who was represented in court by her conductor husband @entity9 , 68 , right , - £ 100,000 in february 2010 using her rare @entity32 as security the builder successfully sued for the money , which was owed as part of a £ 100,000 bill for works carried out on their home in 2002 , and the lawyers ' bills continued to mount up when the musical couple lost their appeal against the decision in 2007			1
to pay the legal bills totalling more than £ 185,000 , mrs @entity2 , from @entity46 , used the rare viola , made by renowned @entity49 craftsman , @entity48 in 1803 , as security for a series of cash loans			1
mrs @entity2 effectively ' mortgaged ' her instrument for six - figure loans to two antique instrument dealers , @entity29 and @entity56 , and a pawnbroking firm , @entity57 , raising £ 280,000 as a result			1
the court heard that instrument dealer mr @entity56 lent mrs @entity2 £ 50,000 in 2009 after agreeing that he would sell the viola , which she had owned for years , on her behalf			1
the loan was arranged on the understanding that the money he lent her would be repaid when he sold the viola			2
in february 2010 mr @entity29 , also a dealer in fine stringed instruments , who lives in @entity73 , @entity74 , lent mrs @entity2 £ 100,000 after she approached him following a service at his local church			2
the loan carried a monthly interest rate of 2.5 per cent			0
finally , mrs @entity2 , a former member of @entity79 in the @entity80 and a number of symphony orchestras , pledged the viola to @entity84 in return for £ 130,000			1
country house : the @entity87 put their house in @entity46 on the market for £ 3million to help pay the bills mr @entity9 , with what the judge described as ‘ conspicuous skill ’ , fought his wife ’s corner in court after she was too unwell to attend the hearing , insisting that the loans were unenforceable			1
however , mr @entity99 rejected the conductor 's bid to save the viola for his wife , and ruled that mr @entity29 and @entity104 were entitled to their money back , with interest			1
the viola was bought by mr @entity56 last month for £ 230,000 , but that was not enough to cover mrs @entity2 ’s debts			1
the money will be divided up between @entity84 and mr @entity29 , but that still leaves mrs @entity2 heavily in debt and facing a potential claim by mr @entity56 for return of the £ 50,000 he loaned her			2
good violas , like this one , can cost several thousand pounds but mrs @entity2 's could be worth up to £ 400,000 , an antiques dealer said on top of that , the couple , who were reportedly declared bankrupt last year , may face having to pay the six - figure legal costs of the three - day @entity19 hearing			1
earlier mr @entity9 argued that the viola was worth far more than the £ 230,000			2
it had been insured for £ 350,000 in 2009 and , he said , was probably worth more than that now			0
but the judge described the price mr @entity56 paid as ' the best price reasonably obtainable '			0
speaking outside court at the beginning of the case , mr @entity29 said of the contested instrument : ' it ’s a nice viola - it ’s a rarity			0
' @entity48 was the last of the great @entity49 makers			0
whoever buys it will probably sell it for about £ 400,000			0
' the @entity140 ' house was put on the market a year ago for £ 3million			0
@entity9 is a former member of the @entity142 and professor at the @entity144 and is part of a 500 - year - old musical dynasty , with a family tree linking him to six talented @entity149 brothers brought over from @entity149 by @entity150 to entertain his court			0
a trombonist who is music director at the @entity154 and conductor of the city of @entity157 , his ancestors were @entity159 musicians			0
@entity2 , also known as @entity160 , is a former member of the @entity79 in the @entity80 and a member of a number of symphony orchestras			0
originally from @entity164 , she has been playing the viola since the age of 11 and is said to be one of the world 's best			0
talented : @entity2 has performed alongside musicians including @entity6 , left , and @entity7 she was the first woman to play principal viola with the @entity171 and has performed with @entity6 and @entity172 , @entity7 and @entity8			2
she has also recorded soundtracks for the @entity174 and @entity176 films			0
the couple have four children , three boys and a girl , and the boys were educated at @entity11 ( where boarding fees cost £ 33,000 a year ) while their daughter went to @entity12 ( £ 30,000 a year )			0
they bought their brick and flint house which enjoys far - reaching views over the @entity16 countryside in 1997 for £ 350,000 , and it is now said to be worth around £ 3million .			2

@entity2 , 57 , is married to renowned conductor @entity9 , 68
the couple refused to pay £ 16,000 of a builder 's bill for work on their home
it *triggered* lengthy legal *battle* resulting in them owing more than £ 185,000
the @entity87 *borrowed* to pay the bills , using her rare viola as security
but they were forced to sell the instrument to pay back their *creditors*
they still owe money and may have to sell their house in @entity16
