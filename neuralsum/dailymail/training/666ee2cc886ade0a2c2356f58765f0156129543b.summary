the flame had been blown out by a gust of wind as the retired @entity23 - @entity22 swimmer carried it along a passageway to the @entity26 in @entity27			1
@entity1 were lightning quick to seize on the marketing opportunity by publishing the image and video shorts across the internet with the hashtag # @entity32			1
the image is still on the @entity43 page of the company 's @entity45 distributor @entity59			2
@entity61 , the global marketing director for the @entity50 - based company , told @entity64 : ' it was never meant to imply that somehow we had any relationship or sponsorship with the @entity6 committee at all			2
' it is not clear what legal steps are open to the organisers , @entity70 organising chief @entity69 told @entity64			0
torchbearer and former swimming champion @entity75 indicates that his flame has blown out fire starter : a security guard was forced to light the @entity6 flame with a lighter after it went out back in the game ! @entity69 , president of the @entity70 organising committee , said on @entity83 that the problem was due to a valve on the torch which had not been opened fully the flame was lit a week ago in @entity88 and flown to @entity27 for the @entity53 in @entity70			1
however , the glitch occurred when a torchbearer ran through a long passageway leading into the @entity26 which apparently created a wind tunnel , extinguishing the flame			2
a man standing along the route , most likely part of the presidential security service , pulled out a @entity1 lighter and re-lit the flame			0
@entity69 , president of the @entity70 organising committee , said on @entity83 that the problem was due to valve on the torch which had not been opened fully			0
it was not the first time the flame has been extinguished in @entity27			1
@entity105 president @entity104 was left red - faced on sunday when he lit the @entity6 flame in @entity107 only for it to go out			1
@entity108 , a champion swimmer for the @entity23 , once saved 20 passengers from a bus that had fallen into a reservoir			0
he used his legs to break the back window of the bus as it lay in 10 metres ( 30 feet ) of water , and pulled out 20 of the 92 passengers @entity104 holds the torch with the @entity6 flame during a ceremony in @entity27 's @entity107 the relay began in @entity27 , where hundreds of athletes and public figures including @entity122 took part			1
the flame will now make its way across @entity105 , travelling from @entity126 to the easternmost point of the country just across the @entity129 from @entity130 , before swinging back to @entity70 in time for the opening ceremony on february 7			2
for most of the 65,000 kilometre ( 39,000 - mile ) trip , the flame will travel by plane , train , car and even reindeer sleigh , safely encased inside a lantern			0
but 14,000 torch bearers also will take place in the relay at the more than 130 stops along the way			0
@entity104 holds the @entity6 torch in @entity27 's @entity107 before it will embark on its tour young @entity105 figure skaters @entity147 , right , and @entity148 carry the @entity6 torch one of the silver and red torches , unlit , will be carried into space in november for a brief visit to the @entity153 , and this same torch will be used to light the @entity6 flame in @entity70			1
@entity104 , for whom the @entity6 are a source of personal pride , said the relay will ' show the world @entity105 as she is and as we love her			2
' it will pass through many cities that showcase the historical , cultural and ethnic richness of @entity105 , while other cities on the route are more closely associated with the evils of @entity171 , the harsh treatment of dissent under @entity104 or the @entity174 insurgency simmering in the @entity175 not far from @entity70 's ski slopes			0
as the relay crosses the expanses of @entity180 , it will put the spotlight on @entity105 's immense wealth of natural resources and the rusting of its industrial towns .			0
