whatever the upshot from that @entity3 lawyer ’s bizarre appeal against his own report into allegations of @entity7 bidding corruption – and do n’t hold your breath on that one – @entity12 ’s claim to the moral high ground has been blown from under their feet			1
whether or not @entity16 ’s ethics committee have finessed – twisted even – @entity19 ’s findings with regard to @entity21 , the @entity17 are in the dock for the way they went about campaigning to host the 2018 finals instead of @entity26			1
of all people , the custodians of our national game crawled into bed with the disgraced @entity32 who @entity16 , none other , have kicked out of their vice-presidency and who has been cited for fraud by the governing body of football in the @entity38 , of which he used to be president			2
@entity32 told prince @entity40 and @entity41 and @entity42 he would vote for @entity12 - then reneged @entity12 bid team could be punished over 2018 @entity7 efforts ... but @entity21 are cleared to host 2022 event ! @entity16 investigator @entity19 to appeal against his own body 's interpretation of his report @entity26 2018 bid 's computers and emails ' destroyed ' , say @entity16 who is @entity19 ? @entity54 's lowdown on @entity16 investigator they granted lavish favours and squandered millions on this treacherous figure who did not even vote for @entity12 when it came to casting his ballot			1
in so doing the @entity17 dragged their own president , prince @entity40 , two of this country ’s prime ministers , @entity62 and @entity41 , our ultimate olympian @entity65 and even poor old unsuspecting @entity42 , among many , into the mire with them			2
it used to seem that the @entity17 were merely naïve and incompetent when it came to international football affairs			2
now , with this shabby business following their reneging on the gentleman ’s agreement not to bid against @entity79 for the 2006 @entity7 , they appear at best stupid , at worst as dodgy as those they have presumed to impugn			1
while it may seem disproportionate for @entity12 ’s dubious dealings to catch most of the back - draft from an investigation into something as serious as how over-heated @entity21 came to be awarded a @entity7 , there can be no escaping the @entity17 ’s sorry reality now			1
the @entity17 are set to come under fire for trying to woo former @entity16 vice president @entity32 ( second left ) after the humiliation of receiving only two votes for 2018 this , the mother country of the global game , is now a broken off - shoot from the world football community , bereft of even the slightest influence			1
after all the @entity12 ranting at @entity16 , long is it likely to remain so			2
as for the tin pot mps who have done nothing about bent bankers , failed to indict @entity101 for going to war under false pretences or call their own @entity104 to order for fraudulent misconduct - but have been falling over themselves to jump on the populist @entity107 bandwagon - they are left clinging to an @entity110 lawyer ’s coat - tails			0
good luck with that , since @entity19 will be perceived in many quarters abroad as trying to distance himself from the backlash on social media following @entity21 ’s absolution from wrong - doing , in case it damages his ambition of high office in @entity122			0
and as for the backlash itself – whipped up as it is here by jingoistic resentment of @entity12 not being given the 2018 @entity7 – the most popular remedies being suggested are impractical			1
resign from @entity16 , they cry			2
former @entity16 vice-president @entity32 has been kicked out of the organisation quite simply , the @entity17 can not afford to do that			1
already grappling with the financial implications of the new @entity131 and the centre of coaching excellence , they need not only big @entity12 international matches to avoid the risk of going broke but – like it or not – their share in the financial windfall from @entity139			0
and even if they did pull out , they would find themselves isolated			0
there is a notion that the @entity110 , if no - one else , would walk with us			0
that founders on their understanding that @entity16 will take the @entity7 back to @entity146 soon , perhaps in 2026 , the successor to @entity21			2
there are few echoes abroad of the uproar in this country			0
@entity16 president @entity152 is a racing certainty for re-election in may because the overwhelming majority of national federations appreciate the billions he generates for the sustenance and development of football around the planet			0
as for @entity19 ’s protest , the @entity16 appeals committee is manned mostly by representatives of the countries in most urgent need of that income			0
our hitherto invisible mp have started demanding examination of the @entity7 bidding process by governments and their police forces			0
they seem unaware that the most relevant national state , given that @entity16 is based in @entity175 , recently completed an exhaustive criminal investigation			0
their principal target was @entity152 , whom they ultimately cleared of all suspicion			0
nor did they find anything to indict in @entity16 ’s governance of football			0
the sir @entity186 statue in @entity187 not only that but the ghastly @entity32 is only one of half - a - dozen or so officials who have been rooted out by @entity16 with far greater alacrity than our government have ousted the crooks in the @entity194 and in @entity195			1
wherever the @entity21 fandango leads it wo n’t be @entity12 sign - posting the direction – or hosting a @entity7 in most of our lifetimes			2
cheers to sir @entity186 - help save this local pub the locals are revolting			1
patrons of the sir @entity186 in @entity205 are fighting to prevent the demolition of the only pub named after @entity12 ’s @entity7 - winning manager			1
they are asking football lovers around the country to help them lobby politicians in @entity213 and the editor of the local @entity216 newspaper , as well as taking to social media			0
pressure is mounting against planning application by the owner for the building to be sold , knocked down and replaced by four homes			0
there are two notable monuments to sir @entity186 , a statue in @entity187 which became his home town during his successful time there as manager and a bust of his head in the players ’ tunnel at the new @entity235			1
but the pub stands alone in preserving a priceless @entity7 memory , that of how he used to buy his players ‘ just one beer ’ at the @entity12 team hotel on the evenings before their big matches			1
@entity245 ( left ) and then @entity12 manager @entity246 unveil the bust of @entity186 in 2009 to join the campaign search ‘ save our pub ’ on @entity251 or e-mail @entity253			1

@entity12 's claim to moral high ground over @entity16 is no more
@entity17 are in the dock for way they went about trying to host 2018 @entity7
@entity17 appear stupid at best , dodgy at worst after trying to court @entity32
locals are trying to save the sir @entity186 pub in @entity205
