the 168th @entity1 derby is looming on sunday and the match has gained added importance for @entity5 ’s men			1
by their high standards , @entity6 have slipped into slumber over the last three games with two losses and a draw characterised by unimaginative , jaded displays from their most important players			2
a 2 - 0 defeat at the hands of @entity16 to send them out of the @entity18 alone would have been enough to cast a shadow over @entity5 ’s week , but it followed a lacklustre @entity21 defeat at @entity22 and a stuttering @entity24 stalemate with @entity25			1
@entity5 has plenty of issues to address if @entity6 are to recover their form this season @entity6 's players trudge off dejected after their 2 - 0 home loss to @entity16 in the @entity18 city find themselves six points behind leaders @entity35 ahead of the weekend 's @entity21 action striker @entity37 looks dejected after seeing @entity6 's defence of the @entity18 come to an early end it is fair to say the @entity41 is in the midst of the most trying week of his @entity6 career so far , with @entity6 in danger of going out of the @entity24 and at risk of repeating their doomed title defence of 2012 - 13			1
he must arrest the slide on sunday if they are to keep @entity35 in their sights			2
here are five items in @entity53 's in - tray at the moment			0
the defence is still a cause for concern @entity5 said the team had been working on its defence before the @entity16 game but there was scant evidence of that as @entity66 ’s side , largely without the world class talent of @entity6 , were allowed too much time and space to make their breakthroughs			1
@entity22 manager @entity72 fired the warning shots at the weekend when he pinpointed @entity6 new boy @entity74 as one of the weaknesses his side exploited last week			1
@entity74 was unable to stop @entity16 's @entity78 scoring their opening goal on wednesday @entity5 believes @entity74 has been a scapegoat like @entity81 ( right ) was last season city line up to defend a @entity85 free - kick during wednesday night 's match at the @entity87 the 23 - year - old , bought for £ 32m in the summer , has failed to justify his price tag so far but @entity5 suggested he was being scapegoated in the same way as @entity81 was last year			1
the city manager will hope @entity74 can emulate the @entity92 by turning his career at the @entity87 around in a similar fashion			2
injuries are in danger of derailing progress @entity5 ’s decision to field a strong starting xi in the @entity18 , the competition which gave him his first silverware in @entity101 , is laudable			1
but the sight of playmaker @entity105 limping off after eight minutes , with a derby four days away , suggested it had perhaps been ill advised			2
the @entity107 is a vital cog in the @entity6 side and a game changing talent			2
@entity6 suffered another blow when playmaker @entity105 limped off after just eight minutes @entity105 's injury presents another headache for @entity5 ahead of sunday 's clash with @entity16 @entity5 might have been better off resting him in midweek , having played against @entity22 just four days previously			1
@entity6 will receive news about @entity105 ’s knee injury on thursday and will be hoping for a positive report			1
@entity118 also exited lamely after an hour last night with a groin strain , although @entity5 said that was merely precautionary			2
city are a team struggling for confidence the current run of results - draw - loss - loss - would not be viewed as a mini crisis at most other clubs but this is is a side that has become accustomed to victory			0
they have won just six of 15 games in all competitions this season and are now on a three - match winless run for the second time in a season that is less than three months old			0
@entity5 conceded that his players were low on confidence and suffering from a ‘ lack of trust ’			0
with the defence leaking goals and attacking players not capitalising on chances , the confidence problem will only intensify if they fail to get a result against @entity16			2
@entity147 looks crest - fallen after referee @entity148 shows him a yellow card @entity150 bellows instructions to his team - mates during the @entity16 game @entity154 fails to keep out @entity156 's header in @entity6 's 2 - 1 loss at @entity6 last saturday the @entity6 defence react as @entity25 are awarded a penalty in last week 's @entity24 tie just what has happened to @entity118 ? last season he was the driving force at the @entity87 , dominating with his trademark runs down the centre of the pitch and leading by example			1
there have been glimpses of his greatness this season , too , but he has been largely ineffectual , lacking sharpness , being outmuscled by his opponents and occasionally looking disinterested			0
he has scored only one goal - an impressive strike against @entity175 and even then he was poor for the rest of the game			0
if he does n't start improving soon he 'll be lucky to get a birthday card , never mind a cake from @entity6			0
@entity118 grimaces as he leaves the field after an hour of the match with @entity16 city are growing a reputation for being a lousy cup team @entity6 have a proud and rich history in the cups , with their first @entity188 trophy dating back to 1904			1
they have had success recently , too , winning the @entity188 in 2011 , the @entity190 in 2012 and lifting the @entity18 earlier this year			0
@entity5 clearly values them , too , consistently fielding strong teams			0
but for some reason , they just ca n’t find their feet this season			0
including the @entity190 , they have one just one of six cup games and that was against @entity198 side @entity197			0
@entity5 has inspired @entity6 to reverse their form before , encouraging his side to magnificently catch and overhaul @entity201 in last season ’s title race			1
his side showed real character and focus to hunt down @entity201 and secure the title on the final day of the season , meaning he had a league - cup double to show for his first season in charge			0
@entity211 facing injury lay - off			0

@entity6 were *dumped* out of the @entity18 by @entity16
they trail @entity35 by six points in the @entity21
@entity5 's men also have work to do in the @entity24
the defence , including £ 32m *signing* @entity74 , look shaky
@entity118 is nowhere near the force he was last season
injuries are mounting up with @entity105 the latest on treatment table
