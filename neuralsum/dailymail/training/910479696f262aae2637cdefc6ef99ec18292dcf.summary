by @entity0 published : 16:57 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 17:07 est , 1 may 2012 a former @entity2 student who was found guilty of hate crimes for using a webcam to view his roommate kissing another man has asked a judge to overturn the jury 's conviction			1
in a legal filing tuesday , @entity11 's lawyers said the jury convicted him in march despite evidence that he was not guilty of invading the privacy or intimidating roommate @entity18 , who killed himself days after the webcam was used			1
and on the most disputed and serious charges — bias intimidation — the lawyers say the law was misused			0
legal filing : lawyers for @entity11 ( left ) said the jury convicted him evidence that he was not guilty of invading the privacy or intimidating roommate @entity18 ( right ) on some of those counts , the jury found that @entity34 did not mean to intimidate @entity35 or the other man , but that @entity35 reasonably believed he did			1
jurors said as much both in their findings in court and in comments afterward to journalists			0
copies of some news articles were included with the brief to support @entity34 's lawyers ' position			1
' to criminalize a defendant for a victim 's mistaken belief about the defendant 's motive would turn the bias intimidation statute into a mockery of itself , ' wrote the lawyers , @entity55 and @entity56			2
it is standard practice for lawyers to ask for a judge to overturn a conviction after a jury delivers it			1
in @entity34 's case , the request is for the judge to acquit @entity34 entirely — or at least grant him a new trial			1
filing : @entity34 's lawyers said he was convicted despite evidence he was not guilty			1
one of his defense attorney 's , @entity56 is pictured second left , as @entity34 ( centre ) is supported by his father , @entity72 ( second right ) the lawyers said that the jury was wrong on invasion of privacy charges because the snippets video that @entity34 and others saw did not show sexual acts or nudity			1
prosecutors had no immediate comment on the court filing			0
but they 're sure to have more to say in coming weeks as they file papers to recommend a sentence for @entity34			2
he could face 10 years in prison when he 's sentenced on may 21			1
and because he 's a citizen of @entity88 , where he was born , @entity34 could also be deported eventually because of the conviction			1
the case has enflamed passions			0
almost immediately after his suicide in september 2010 , @entity35 came to be seen as a symbol of the bullying young gays can face			0
president @entity96 spoke out about the case and talk - show host @entity97 made it a key cause of hers			0
potential : @entity18 was a talented violin player before he killed himself by jumping off the @entity104 bridge some have come to see @entity34 as a victim of an overzealous legal system , a man convicted not so much for what he did but what happened afterward			1
last month , former gov. @entity111 , who left office in 2004 after announcing he was gay , wrote an opinion piece in @entity116 - @entity115 newspaper arguing against a prison sentence for him			0
while there is much dispute in court and elsewhere about how the law should be applied in the case , there is little disagreement over the facts			0
jurors heard that @entity35 and @entity34 , both 18 - year - old freshmen from well - off @entity129 suburbs who were assigned at random to be roommates , did not speak much			2
a few weeks into the school year , @entity35 asked @entity34 for the room when he was planning to have over a man he 'd met online			2
jurors heard that @entity34 was nervous about the @entity136 he 'd left in their room and wondered what was going on , so he and a friend turned on his webcam and saw seconds of , as @entity34 described in a tweet , his roommate ' making out with a dude '			2
two nights later , when @entity35 asked for privacy again , @entity34 obliged			2
heartbreak : @entity147 's parents , @entity148 and @entity149 , were said to be happy with the original verdict this time , he told friends through text messages , tweets and in - person conversations how they could connect with his webcam to see what happened between @entity35 and his guest , who testified at the trial but was only identified by the initials @entity159 because he 's considered the victim of a sex crime			0
but the webcam was off that night			0
by the time of that second rendezvous , @entity35 had learned that @entity34 had watched him and he initiated a request for a room change			0
the next night , @entity35 , a violinist , made his way to the @entity104 and jumped to his death , leaving behind a final @entity170 status : ' jumping off the @entity104 bridge , sorry '			0
jurors found @entity34 guilty of all 15 counts he faced , including bias intimidation , invasion of privacy and tampering with evidence and a witness to try to cover up the other crimes .			1

his lawyers say the jury convicted him despite evidence he was not guilty of invading @entity18 's privacy
they are asking the judge to acquit @entity34 entirely or at least grant him a new trial
@entity34 faces 10 years in prison and could be deported to @entity88 , where he was born
