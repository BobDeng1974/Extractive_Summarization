instincts : couples should go with their gut feelings if they want to live happily ever after , a new study claims if you want to know whether you and your partner will have a happy marriage , you should not let your heart or your head rule , it seems			1
for the secret to predicting the chances of long - term marital bliss is down to basic gut instinct , a study claims			1
scientists have found we are better able to predict the long - term success of our relationship on a subconscious level , with lurking doubts a good indicator that trouble lies ahead			1
psychologists conducted tests on 135 newlywed couples , then checked their progress over four years			1
they found the feelings participants expressed when answering a questionnaire about their marriage had little bearing on their consequent satisfaction with their relationship			1
but their gut instincts , revealed in series of tests , accurately mirrored their future level of happiness			1
‘ although they may be largely unwilling or unable to verbalise them , people ’s automatic evaluations of their partners predict one of the most important outcomes of their lives – the trajectory of their marital satisfaction , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity37 of @entity38			1
the study , published in the journal @entity51 , looked at emotions buried under the surface and whether they affected an individual ’s responses			2
photos of volunteers ’ spouses were flashed on a computer screen for a fraction of a second , followed by a positive word such as ‘ awesome ’ or a negative one such as ‘ awful ’			2
participants had to choose whether they viewed the word as positive or negative			0
‘ people who have really positive feelings about their partners are very quick to indicate that words like awesome are positive words and very slow to indicate that words like awful are negative words , ’ said dr @entity37			2
analysis : @entity72 ' sub-conscious feelings for each other were tested the opposite was also true , the researchers said , with participants who had negative feelings about their partners taking longer to respond to positive words and less time to respond to negative ones			1
this was the case even when the individuals were not conscious of their conflicting emotions			0
the couples were questioned about their level of relationship satisfaction every six months afterwards			0
those who had revealed negative or lukewarm feelings towards their partner reported the most marital dissatisfaction four years later			2
‘ everyone wants to be in a good marriage , ’ said dr @entity37			0
‘ and in the beginning , many people are able to convince themselves of that at a conscious level			0
‘ but these automatic , gut - level responses are less influenced by what people want to think			0
‘ you ca n’t make yourself have a positive response through a lot of wishful thinking			0
‘ if they can sense that their gut is telling them that there is a problem , then they might benefit from exploring that , maybe even with a professional marriage counsellor			0

@entity72 ' sub-conscious feelings for each other were tested in a new study
the @entity38 research analysed 135 newlyweds
it found that feelings expressed in questionnaires were *fairly* *meaningless*
it *'s* sub-conscious feelings that have a bearing on future happiness
