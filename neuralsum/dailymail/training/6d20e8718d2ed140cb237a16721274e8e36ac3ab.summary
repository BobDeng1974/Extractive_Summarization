a teenager has become the first ever openly gay head boy to be given the role at one of the country 's elite group of public schools			2
@entity7 , 17 , who came out to his family three years ago , was voted in by more than 1,000 pupils and staff at @entity11 in @entity12 , one of the most successful schools of its type in @entity17 , with boarding fees starting at £ 27,000 a year			1
@entity7 , the son of a banker , said : ' i do n't think my sexuality had any impact on my being chosen , but in other periods , when people had to hide their sexuality , it could have been a different story			2
' the new head boy appointed at @entity11 is an openly gay teenager			2
it is the first time a top public school has made such an appointment headmaster @entity30 said there was a huge round of applause when the announcement was made and said teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 see sexuality as a ' so - what ' issue			1
he added : ' he was a very popular choice - the rugby players voted for him along with many others - but i bet if i wrote to the old boys and said our head boy was openly gay , some of them would think it 's very strange indeed			0
' mr @entity7 has used his new position to speak critically of schools that use policies that stopteachers from discussing homosexuality			1
gay rights campaigners have highlighted 40 schools that use sex education policies that forbid ' promoting ' homosexuality , similar to the controversial section 28 of the @entity58 implemented by @entity60 's government			0
' i do n't think my sexuality had any impact on my being chosen , but in other periods , when people had to hide their sexuality , it could have been a different story ' - @entity7 section 28 made it an offence for a local authority to ' intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality ' or to ' promote the teaching in any maintained school the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship '			1
it has since been repealed			0
the teenager 's stance is supported by mr @entity30 , who described the schools ' actions as ' outrageous '			0
mr @entity7 , speaking to @entity84 , said the root of the issue lies with the attitudes of those running the schools			1
he said : ' they grew up in a society where homosexuality was n't spoken about			0
their views need to be changed			0
