by @entity0 as half of the singing duo @entity2 , @entity1 has been described as having one of the greatest voices in pop. alongside songwriter @entity14 , his angelic tones on hits such as @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and mrs @entity13 helped to turn them into one of the most popular singing duos in the world			1
so when @entity1 suffered serious vocal chord problems four years ago , leading to the loss of his trademark sound and cancellation of the duo ’s 2010 tour , you might have expected @entity14 to have been supportive			1
@entity1 and @entity14 in happier times in 1984 performing at @entity27 in @entity28 @entity2 during a live performance on @entity30 's saturday night in 1975 in @entity31 ‘ he was n’t particularly			1
but no , i ’m not upset , ’ says @entity1 tersely			1
he pauses , then adds : ‘ but i ’m used to the fact that we ’re just different characters			1
’ the duo may have harmonised exquisitely on stage but their 60 - year relationship off it — they met at junior school and were trying to broker a record contract together by the time they were teenagers — has been stormy			1
you can ask @entity1 , 72 , about anything — his friendship with @entity47 , his love affairs , even the suicide of an ex-girlfriend — and he will answer			1
it is only when the topic of @entity14 crops up that the temperature starts to chill slightly			1
they broke up spectacularly , and very publicly , in 1970 , soon after the release of their seminal album @entity10			2
@entity14 is said to have resented his dependence on @entity1 to interpret the songs he wrote , and @entity1 resented @entity14 ’s resentment			1
there was a row over a tour			1
the duo , who had a very public falling out in the 1970s , performing at @entity66 in 1972 ‘ that was our worst - ever fight , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ after all that shouting we called it quits			2
’ they have reunited to perform and even tour together several times over the decades since , but @entity14 said recently that he will never record with @entity1 again ‘ because that would be revisiting the past ’			1
@entity1 once said that his relationship with @entity14 ‘ causes me far more pain than my relationships with anybody else i could name ’ , although now he demurs			1
‘ did i say that ? that does n’t feel right , although i guess we are deep old friends , and when there ’s depth there , there ’s going to be shade as well as light			2
’ @entity1 once said that his relationship with @entity14 ' causes me far more pain than my relationships with anybody else i could name ' when @entity1 was pursuing a successful solo career in 1979 — his single @entity90 , from the film @entity91 , was the @entity93 ’s biggest seller that year — his girlfriend , 25 - year - old actress @entity94 , committed suicide			1
the couple had been together for several years and @entity1 took the loss hard			1
during performances of @entity12 , @entity94 would often come to his mind			2
‘ especially when i sang the line remember me to one who lives there / she once was a true love of mine , ’ he says			2
‘ i do n’t feel the loss as palpably as i did years ago , but the first four or five years were life - stopping			2
i was very introverted in the @entity106			2
i stayed at home and communed with my memories and @entity94 ’s diaries , and read @entity110 and @entity111			2
‘ i went all “ high artist ” on myself and could n’t face the world			2
‘ then i started hanging out with @entity115			2
she ’s a great film director and actress who ’s just so light and funny that she helped bring me out of myself			2
we had a million laughs , the sex was good and it got me out of my introversion			2
we ’re still friends , but i ’m a married guy now — my heart is elsewhere			2
’ these days @entity1 ’s heart belongs to actress and singer @entity124 , 56 , his wife of 25 years			1
garfunkel with his wife @entity124 at the @entity127 's in @entity28 in 2008 of the 16 - year age gap between them , he says : ‘ it does n’t seem to bother us at all and , actually , i love that she ’s younger than me			1
there ’s a nice amount of differentness between us : i ’m urban and she ’s @entity137 ; i ’m much more cerebral and she ’s way sweeter than i am and free of a lot of my thorniness			2
we slip together pretty naturally			0
’ it ’s his second marriage			0
his first , to architect @entity142 , ended in the @entity143 after just three years			0
he and @entity124 have two children — @entity146 , 23 , who is also a singer ( ‘ he ’s better than me and sings higher than i do ! ’ ) and eight - year - old @entity147 , who was born via a surrogate			0
‘ we wanted a second child and i sometimes wondered if it would ever happen			0
but it finally did 15 years later , which is lovely and very unusual			0
garfunkel in the 1980 movie @entity155 alongside @entity156 ‘ at my age , it was a wonderful shot of new life and i can say to all daddies who are getting on in years , it ’s spiritually and poetically magnificent to have a child later in life			1
‘ now that i ’m older , the godliness of a child speaks powerfully to me			0
in my 20s i was chasing the charts and the fun of artistic projects , and in my 30s i was self - involved			0
it was only once i hit my mid- 40s that i realised it was n’t all about me and that life was about giving life			0
’ @entity1 ’s pursuit of artistic projects was n’t limited to music			1
after recording the soundtrack to the @entity175 film @entity174 , which included the 1968 hit mrs @entity13 , both @entity1 and @entity14 — who went on to marry actress @entity176 — began to harbour acting ambitions			1
@entity178 signed the duo to act in his 1970 movie adaptation of @entity182 ’s novel @entity181 , but @entity14 ’s minor part in it ended up on the cutting - room floor			1
that garfunkel was given fourth billing was said to be another factor in their parting			1
@entity14 has said he will never record with @entity186 again as that would be like ' revisiting the past ' in 1971 , @entity178 put @entity1 into @entity192 , co-starring with @entity47 as college room - mates			1
‘ we became buddies , ’ garfunkel says			1
‘ he ’s not the frivolous man people think he is			0
but those were fun times and fame was a big kick			0
do n’t let anyone tell you otherwise ! ’ and the best part of fame ? ‘ the girls were a big thing , ’ he says after a moment ’s reflection , ‘ because suddenly you ’re not such a loner and not so different from everyone else			0
’ growing up in @entity31 , that incredible voice initially set him apart from the other kids			0
‘ i started singing in echoing apartment block stairwells when i was five and i knew i was different from a very young age , ’ he says			0
‘ i was a loner and i was lonesome			0
‘ then i met @entity14 at school when i was 11			1
he was another guy who loved music			0
finally , i felt understood			0
’ and for all their ups and downs , it ’s that memory that remains			0
‘ forget the other stuff , ’ says @entity1 gently			1
‘ this is what @entity2 is all about			0
’ could the pair ever work together again ? ‘ well , we do n’t speak that often , but i think the world of him as a great musician and an interesting cat , ’ he says carefully			0
‘ but it takes two to tango			0
we ’ll just have to see what chance brings			0
’ @entity1 — minus @entity14 — will be touring the @entity93 in september			1
while the hair might not be the blond halo it once was , his honeyed tones are still much in evidence			0
‘ when i had vocal problems for a few years , i ’ll admit i did n’t know how to be me , ’ he says			0
‘ it ’s a real thrill to have my voice back and to shape this new show			0
‘ there are three parts to it : i ’ll sing and i ’ll be doing some of our old hits ; i ’ll read some things i ’ve been writing for the past 30 years ; then i ’ll answer questions from the audience			0
i try to be candid and it ’s nice to share all these memories			0
i mean , ai n’t i a lucky duck ? ’ * @entity1 ’s @entity93 tour starts on september 5			1
