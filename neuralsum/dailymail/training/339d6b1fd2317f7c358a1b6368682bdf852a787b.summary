by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 05:25 est , 1 may 2012 it may look like its glory days are far far behind it - but this rusting @entity3 is expected to fetch £ 15,000 at auction			1
it has been left untouched and unloved in a @entity6 barn since 1986 , but it now emerges that the car is the world ’s oldest original @entity3			1
the decrepit motor was the eighth to be made when it rolled off the production line in 1959 and despite is poor condition , the vehicle is being described as a ‘ classic ’			1
@entity15 : the grey paint work on the @entity3 is still visible in place , but the car is still far from roadworthy enthusiasts keen on the prospect of returning the dusty @entity21 to its original condition are expected to drive up its price			1
the vehicle was bought by a @entity26 in 1986 from a @entity27 of @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30			0
mr @entity26 kept the car , which originally cost £ 497 and has a 848cc engine , in a @entity6 barn until last year			1
the @entity3 has just 30,000 miles on the clock , but after rusting away for more than two decades does n’t actually work			2
@entity35 : the basic design is a far cry from modern luxuries such as air conditioning and electric windows through the rust it is possible to glimpse the original @entity44 paintwork , and it retains the original registration plate : @entity47 27			0
the interior is basic , but has all the original features including its only dashboard instrument - a speedometer			0
it was built in july 1959 at @entity53 , @entity54 , three months before the model went into full production			2
workings : the @entity3 was designed in the 1950s at a time of fuel shortages and its engine is just 848cc it was then sent to @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , where it was first sold			2
it has emerged again in need a full make - over : inside , outside and under the bonnet			0
@entity67 , from @entity68 which is selling the car , said : ' this is a wonderful opportunity to buy the car and restore it			0
it is the oldest unrestored @entity3			1
' collectors love the fact it has had very little done to it since it was built			0
it was the eight to be produced and is the fourth oldest that survives			1
glory : despite its run down condition the @entity3 retains many of the features that made it such an influential car ' the @entity3 is one of the most important cars of the 20th century			1
they have always been collectable			0
' some collectors would want to return her to new , but others would just like to get her going again and keep her in the original condition			0
' it is thought that only three @entity3 earlier than this one exist today , but they have all been restored over the years			2
one is at the @entity94 in @entity95 , and the other two are in private collections in @entity98			0
in 1999 the @entity3 was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century , behind the @entity100 its design came about because the @entity102 meant that the country was short of petrol , and smaller cars were required			1
the sale is on april 30 at the @entity107 in @entity108 .			0

the @entity3 first rolled off the production line in 1959
it was the eighth to be produced and is the fourth oldest that survives
