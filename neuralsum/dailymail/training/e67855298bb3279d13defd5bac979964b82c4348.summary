an athlete who spent a year training for a gruelling triathlon missed it - because he overslept			1
@entity4 spent months taking donations and keeping friends up to speed on his preparation for the @entity9 , which would have seen him swim 2.4miles , cycle for 112miles and then run a marathon			1
mr @entity4 set his alarm for 3am , giving him plenty of time to drive to @entity16 , @entity17 , for the start			1
but the 34 - year - old , who was due to be raising funds for @entity21 and @entity22 , after hitting snooze and not waking until 5.55am - far too late to make it in time			1
he said : ' i set the alarm on my phone for 3am			2
it went off but i hit snooze , as i normally do			2
' the only trouble was i had n't switched on the snooze facility for the new time			2
i went back to sleep , and the next thing was the alarm going off at five to six			2
' i held the phone in my hands and looked at the time for a while in disbelief			0
i knew instantly that was it			0
' i was in total shock			0
i just went downstairs and made a cup of tea and said to my fiancee @entity55 , " that 's that , i 'm not racing today "			0
' she was the one shouting and swearing , i was in shock for days			0
' it took me a good two or three days to recover emotionally to be able to even talk about it			0
' i 'm still quite upset with myself			0
i had to apologise to everyone who had supported me , who had sponsored me and donated			0
mr @entity4 was forced to admit the embarrassing situation to his friends and family who had sponsored him hundreds of pounds for the challenge , but ' i 'd prepared for a year , i 'd posted it all on @entity67 , giving updates on the training , and everyone was following it and encouraging me			1
' in fact , the last post the day before said that i felt quite relaxed about the race the next day - i was obviously a little bit too relaxed			1
' mr @entity4 , a manager at a buildings maintenance company , was forced to admit the embarrassing situation to his friends and family who had sponsored him hundreds of pounds for the challenge			1
he wrote in a post on his @entity81 page : ' i would like to apologise to everyone that has sponsored me through this page			2
this morning i failed to start in the event and have let you all down			0
if you would like me to refund your donation , please let me know			0
i 'm so sorry @entity4			1
' determined not to let his friends down , he recreated the triathlon near his home on the @entity93			1
yesterday morning , making the 6:30am start this time , mr @entity4 swam several lengths of the @entity95 , before completing a bike ride and marathon around the village of @entity99 , completing the challenge in around 14 hours			1
he said : ' there is no way i will miss this now			0
it 's actually helped raise donations - and no one said they wanted the money back			2
' focusing on this has kind of pushed that upset to one side			0
' so far mr @entity4 has raised more than £ 1,000 .			1

@entity4 raised hundreds of pounds for *charity* in lead up to the race
he *regularly* updated friends and family on how his training was going
but he put his alarm clock on snooze on the day of the race and overslept
the 34 - year - old wrote a *grovelling* apology to all of his sponsors
mr @entity4 has since ran his own triathlon near his village in @entity30
the £ 1,000 he has raised will go to @entity21 and @entity22
