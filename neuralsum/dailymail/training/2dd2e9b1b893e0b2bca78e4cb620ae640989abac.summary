@entity0 has come under fire for showing @entity3 - inspired headdresses as part of its latest collection presented in @entity7 on tuesday			2
activist @entity8 was dismayed to see models were dressed in feathered headpieces walking down the runway at the star - studded @entity12 show			1
she told @entity14 : ' i think this incident really demonstrates that regardless of a brand ’s status , cultural appropriation and misrepresentation continues to be an ongoing issue in the fashion industry			1
write caption here she said that @entity0 should have learned from previous @entity25 - inspired fashion offenses by @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28 , which should have provided the label with clear - cut lessons before staging its show			1
miss @entity8 , a 26 - year - old member of the @entity33 , and serves as the director of education for @entity35 , says that the runway show ’s portrayal of @entity3 fashion represents a gross underassessment of traditional @entity3 dress as a whole			1
‘ we have over 566 federally - recognized tribes in the @entity44 and very few of those outside of the plains really [ wear ] anything resembling a headdress			2
’ she says that headdresses are ‘ very tribal specific , ’ and that their mass association with @entity3 culture represents a ‘ stereotype			0
’ in fact , miss @entity8 , who resides in @entity53 , has labeled @entity0 ’s headdress designs as an ‘ offensive mockery			1
’ @entity57 and @entity58 : the show was inspired by the old @entity44 west she told us that ‘ there is a way of working with native communities – you can do it in a beautiful way , but when it becomes problematic is when you go off a mainstream stereotype that exists and then say your designs are “ inspired			0
” ’ futhermore , miss @entity8 says that when included in a tribe ’s traditional repertoire , headdresses are a ‘ sacred object ’ that are only used by tribe leaders in religious ceremonies			2
the fashion industry ’s cyclical trend cycle often relies on inspirations that are drawn from foreign cultures			1
miss @entity8 says that she understands this concept , but would find it more appropriate if designers would ‘ speak with the people that they are drawing inspiration from , and go to that community where the designs originate			2
’ she thinks that ‘ it ’s the responsibility of the company to go about it in an appropriate way and look at artists in those communities to find outlets for collaboration , ’ especially in many @entity3 communities , where handcrafts still provide a large source of income			0
representatives for @entity0 issued the following statement to @entity14 : ' the @entity0 - @entity102 2013/2014 collection is a celebration of the beauty of @entity105			0
native americans are an integral part of @entity105 's rich history and culture and the feather headdress , a symbol of strength and bravery , is one of the most visually stunning examples of the creativity and craftsmanship they possessed			0
' the brand ’s headdress debacle follows similar moves by lower - priced brands including @entity27 and @entity26			0
how did it happen ? activists are confused how @entity125 and @entity0 as a whole did not learn from past scandals experienced by @entity26 and @entity27 in 2011 @entity26 pulled its ‘ @entity131 ’ range of designs from store shelves after it prompted widespread outrage for its misrepresentation of @entity3 design			0
similarly , in 2012 , @entity27 faced blowback after it dressed @entity136 in a @entity25 - inspired get - up ( headdress included ) for the ‘ @entity141 ’ portion of its annual fashion show			1
both the brand , as well as miss @entity136 were forced to publicly issue apologies , and @entity27 ultimately cut the look from its televised broadcast			0
miss @entity8 says that @entity0 ’s collection represents ‘ so much more than one clothing item , it ’s even bigger than the fashion industry			1
we are talking about issues that at their core are about colonialism and over racism against indigenous people			0
