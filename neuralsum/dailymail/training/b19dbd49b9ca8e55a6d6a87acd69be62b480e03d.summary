by @entity0 published : 12:32 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 22 january 2013 an increasing number of men are buying treatments for slimming , impotence and hair loss the number of @entity9 men buying slimming , impotence and hair loss products has soared , new figures have revealed			1
a @entity9 online pharmacy says these products now account for 25 per cent of its entire sales of more than £ 15m a year			1
and , in a new trend , it says men increasingly buying treatments for all three ailments in one order			1
an analysis of 2012 sales figures by @entity25 found there was a 40 per cent rise in such orders from customers across the @entity9 , compared to the previous year			1
the most popular products include @entity32 hair loss foam for @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 slimming tablets , and @entity37 , the male sexual enhancer			0
the biggest demand was in @entity39 and the @entity40 , followed by the @entity41 , and then the @entity42			1
in fourth place were customers in @entity45 , followed by those living in the @entity47			0
part of the rise in demand may be attributed to the recession , as increased pressure both at work and at home can cause stress , affecting a man ’s sex drive , and causing weight fluctuation and even hair loss			2
last year a survey found that the @entity40 was ‘ @entity61 of @entity62 ’ experts have warned that there could be a rise in impotence due to men suffering from an increase in stress and anxiety – caused by long working hours , home pressures and the recession			1
last year , in a survey of more than 1,000 people by @entity78 , more than a quarter of couples questioned said they were having less sex than they were a year ago , with men blaming their lack of libido on money worries			2
impotence is a common condition with studies showing that up to 33 per cent of men will suffer it at some point of their life			2
however , the trend may also have been triggered by men increasingly recognising that they can get help and treatment completely anonymously online , instead of having the embarrassment of walking into their local chemist and explaining their symptoms - or even worse , the possibility of seeing someone they know			1
experts say stress can trigger hair loss , erectile dysfunction and comfort eating recent research conducted by the @entity109 and published in @entity110 , identified a link between stress and comfort eating , leading to weight gain			2
and although much of male pattern baldness is thought to be hereditary , stress can also have an impact			2
when a person feels intense stress , the body releases a large amount of adrenaline ; this transmits a signal to the hair follicles which causes them to enter the telogen ( resting ) phase early , where they stay for three months			0
during this phase there is no new hair growth			0
this results in an uneven hair growth pattern which leads to thinning hair and then hair loss			0
as hair is considered to have a non-essential body function , the body will react to stress in a way that it considers being least harmful , hence the hair growth cycle can be affected			0
chemist direct chief pharmacist @entity142 said : ' over the last year we ’ve seen a significant rise in orders from customers requesting treatments for all three conditions			1
' this is supported by anecdotal evidence , with more male customers contacting our pharmacists directly to ask about suitable treatments			0
' she added : ' these are extremely serious issues which can have a detrimental effect on a man ’s self - confidence			0
' we understand that many men feel uncomfortable talking about these problems in person , but want to seek expert help and get the right treatment			0

online chemist says men are increasingly buying treatments for all three ailments in one order , with sales up 40 per cent on the previous year
biggest demand was in @entity39 and @entity40 , followed by the @entity41
experts say stress could be to blame for all three conditions
but *privacy* of buying online is also thought to have *fuelled* demand
