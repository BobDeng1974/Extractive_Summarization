a @entity1 owner was left facing a £ 15,000 repair bill after she lent her beloved car to her friend who filled it up with the wrong fuel			1
businessman @entity7 , 64 , wanted to thank friend @entity8 , 66 , by returning her @entity9 with a full tank after borrowing it for the weekend - but he pumped petrol into the luxury off - roader unaware it actually ran on diesel			1
mrs @entity8 immediately noticed the £ 50,000 @entity17 had a problem and drove the spluttering car to her local @entity1 dealership - with mr @entity7 offering to pay for the damage			1
but they were left angry when the dealership quoted her £ 14,600 to fix the car , before another garage eventually solved the problem for just £ 1,000			1
@entity7 and @entity26 were left angry when they were given a £ 15,000 repair bill after mr @entity7 accidentally put the wrong fuel in her @entity17 mr @entity7 said : ' i wanted to take it back with a full tank			1
she drove off and i had no idea there was a problem			0
' it is a common and very easy mistake to make when especially when you get to my age , when one frequently makes mistakes			0
' we all make mistakes but i do object to being ripped - off to such a ludicrous extent by @entity1 who i have found to be unsympathetic , inefficient and unhelpful			2
' the dealership mrs @entity8 originally took the car to in @entity46 , @entity47 , said the @entity1 needed new fuel pumps , fuel lines , a fuel distributor , pressure regulator and sensor , six high pressure injectors , a fuel hose and even a replacement fuel tank - quoting her £ 14,60 for the work			2
mr @entity7 then got quotes from other official @entity1 dealers and found their prices ranging from £ 5,000 to £ 10,000			1
but he eventually found a garage who would solve the problem it for £ 1,000 - and mr @entity7 has accused @entity1 of trying to rip him off			1
mr @entity7 wanted to say thank you to ms @entity8 by returning the car with a full tank after he borrowed it for a weekend mrs @entity8 has forgiven her friend the blunder , but is angry at @entity1 for trying to charge her nearly £ 15,000 to solve a problem which eventually cost £ 1,000 to fix mr @entity7 , who drives a @entity71 , says a local @entity71 dealer told him they charge £ 450 when it happens to their cars			1
the garage he ended up using carried out the work for just over £ 1,000 - with the 4x4 not needing any of the new parts @entity1 had listed			1
they removed the fuel , fitted a new fuel filter , filled it with a fuel flush detergent to clean out the remainder of the contaminated fuel and then filled it with the diesel			0
they charged him £ 1,103 for parts , labour and vat and the @entity17 is now running as it was before the mix - up			0
mr @entity7 said : ' i 'm happy as i 'm over £ 12,000 better off than if @entity26 had had @entity95 carry out the work as per their estimate of £ 13,169.24			2
' @entity1 should invest another £ 20 on fitting a fail - safe device to their new vehicles as @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 do			2
the fuel cap cover is clearly labelled with the correct type of fuel , but mr @entity7 say @entity1 should fit the cars with a device that prevents users filling up with the wrong kind mr @entity7 is not alone in making the mistake , over 120,000 motorists fill up their car with the wrong fuel each year , prompting some manufacturers to fit safeguards ' i am pretty sure that every potential buyer of a new @entity1 diesel will be delighted to pay £ 100 for what i would regard as a must have option			1
' mr @entity7 , from @entity120 , @entity121 , said mrs @entity8 was very understanding about his fuel blunder			2
mrs @entity8 said : ' i was dumbstruck when i was told the cost , i did n't know what to say or do			0
i could n't be furious with @entity7 but i was furious with @entity1			2
i just thought " for goodness sake "			0
' now the work has been carried out , the car is running brilliantly			0
i just think @entity1 should be taken to task over this			0
' @entity1 have defended the original quote they gave , insisting other parts of the engine would have become damaged and would have needed replacing but @entity1 defended itself over the incident , saying the quote was ' representative of the work that is recommended to be undertaken in this situation '			1
a statement from the @entity141 manufacturer said : ' by not only filling the tank with petrol but also driving the vehicle with the wrong fuel , it is likely that the engine ( in particular the fuel system ) suffered considerable damage			0
' as diesel fuel acts as both a lubricant and a fuel in a diesel engine , the contrasting solvent - effect of petrol could also have caused longer - term impact on the cylinders , valves , pistons etc. in short , it is highly damaging to the engine			0
' @entity1 added its diesel vehicles are fitted with warning labels on the fuel flap and surrounding area which highlight ' very clearly ' the type of fuel the car requires			0
over 120,000 motorists fill their car with the wrong fuel each year and a number of manufacturers now having safeguards to prevent it from happening .			0
