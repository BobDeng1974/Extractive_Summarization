more bungalows should be built for older people to free up bigger homes for families , the new housing minister has declared			1
the move would allow couples still living in large properties after their children have left home to downsize without being forced into a ‘ retirement home ’ or apartment			1
and it would put more large homes on the market for couples with children who need the extra space			2

in recent years there has been a dramatic drop in the construction of bungalows – partly because builders see larger properties as being more profitable			0
mr @entity22 , the @entity39 mp for @entity40 , said his own family provided a good example of the national need for bungalow building			1
he said : ‘ my in - laws are in their 70s , pretty fit , mentally really with it ; they live in a normal house which they both struggle with			0
' they are not ready to move into what they would see as a retirement home , but where they live there is not access to bungalows			0
‘ we should be looking to love bungalows a little bit more			0
they are an important part of the mix , particularly if we do say to people like my in - laws , “ look , there is somewhere you can move to which is ideal for you without having to go into what you might see as a retirement home			1
” housing minister @entity22 , pictured , said : ' we should be looking to love bungalows a little bit more ' speaking in an interview , he added : ‘ in some areas on the outskirts of @entity27 you have tons and tons of apartments being built and not enough houses , because not everyone wants to live in an apartment			1
’ earlier this year the government amended guidelines to require council planners in @entity83 to set aside a certain number of flats or bungalows for older people			1
the move has been prompted by the demands of an ageing population			0
by 2021 the number of households is on course to increase by 2.2million			0
of that , 1.2million are expected to be households aged 65 years and over			0
currently only 2 per cent of homes in @entity83 are bungalows and in 2009 – the most recent available figures – only 300 bungalows were built			1
last year the think tank @entity101 urged reform of the planning system to encourage developers to build more bungalows which would be attractive to older people			0
it estimated there were 25million spare bedrooms among the older population and this is in part due to lack of available bungalows			2
planning rules which forced developers to build at least 30 dwellings per hectare acted as a disincentive towards new bungalows			2
the @entity101 report stated : ‘ it makes no sense to prevent construction of bungalows if we are interested in increasing the housing supply and a more efficient use of the existing housing stock			2
’ however , other property experts believe custom - built apartments have replaced the bungalow as the retirement property of choice			2
last week mr @entity22 unveiled a £ 200million fund to build thousands of new homes on brownfield sites in towns and cities			1
he said that this could protect greenfield areas from development			0
however , the threat of greenfield development remains			0
mr @entity22 said that it was important to ‘ realise just how much open space we have got , ’ although it was local councils who decided on the location of development .			1

empty - *nesters* ' should be able to downsize without being forced into flats '
housing minister @entity22 called them ' an important part of the mix '
only 2 *%* of @entity83 homes are bungalows and only 300 were built in 2009
