by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 16:27 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 16:27 est , 27 july 2012 ministers were shamed into witholding a £ 16million aid payment to @entity3 last night following mounting criticism of their support for a regime accused of serious human rights abuses			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) confirmed that the payment had been blocked indefinitely while officials investigate evidence that @entity3 has been fuelling a bloody civil war in the @entity14			2
the move is a major embarrassment for the government , which has been a staunch defender of the @entity3 government and its controversial president @entity20 , who was due in @entity21 last night for the opening ceremony of the @entity23			1
