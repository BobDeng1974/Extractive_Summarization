the dental nurse had downloaded the @entity15 film to cheer up three - year - old @entity16 who fell ill with an ear infection during the holiday two weeks ago			1
in shock : @entity6 downloaded the film ' @entity9 ' for her poorly son , @entity16 , which cost her more than £ 1,100 but she was left devastated when she discovered the short clip had cost her a whopping £ 1,118 - £ 101 more than the family holiday and the equivalent of £ 223 for every minute of the film			1
popular : @entity9 is much - loved by children all over the world and was the only thing that would calm poorly @entity16 the mother - of - one , who had saved for two years for the trip has refused to pay , blasting @entity33 's bill as ' extortionate '			1
' it 's absolutely disgusting , ' she said			0
' my three - year - old son had been crying for nearly six days because of an ear infection			1
' he is mad for @entity9 and i knew it was the only thing that might get him to calm down			2
' i turned on data roaming for about five minutes and started to download it and got about 18 per cent			0
' i started to worry it would cost me a few hundred - so i stopped the download and waited until i had wifi inside the hotel to download the rest			0
' when we landed home on monday , i got a text from @entity33 updating me on my bill			1
' i was expecting it to be bad , maybe up to £ 300 for the download but i could n't believe it when it said £ 1,118			0
' it has completely ruined the holiday - that 's more than i earn in a month			0
' the holiday cost £ 1,100 and i had been saving for it for about two years			1
' i 'm outraged and i wo n't be paying it			0
' @entity6 had gone on holiday with her partner @entity61 , 23 , and three - year - old son @entity16 earlier this month			1
hit hard : the mother - of - one admitted she knew the download , left , would cost her but she is refusing to pay the amount that she has been charged for five minutes of video @entity16 picked up an ear infection from the flight over to @entity69 , in @entity11 and was ill for six out of the seven - day break			1
contact your network operator before you leave : often they have cheaper bundles or tariffs available if you know you 're going abroad ask if your network can put a cap on the amount of internet you use , to stop your bill spiraling			2
turn off auto - updating of apps or email retrieval : again this means you wo n't use any data allowance use mobile websites instead of full desktop view : this will save data per page turn off data roaming all together : if you do n't want to use the internet when you 're away @entity6 , of @entity93 , @entity94 , forked out a further £ 10 to downloaded the film from @entity96			1
she added : ' i tried to reason with @entity33 on the phone and i offered them £ 300 but said i simply could n't afford to pay the huge bill			1
' they were so rude			0
' they told me i had been warned about it when i arrived in @entity11 with a text message			0
' i did n't dispute the text messages but for five minutes of a download to be charged that much is just extortionate			0
' i had been with them for ten years , a very loyal customer and they have just cut me off			0
' @entity33 today stood by the bill			1
a spokesman said : ' customers are automatically capped to ensure they are not charged more than £ 51 for roaming data in a given month			2
' in this instance the customer contacted @entity33 to opt out of the cap			1
' last month a @entity117 holidaymaker racked up a staggering £ 20,000 mobile phone bill after she used her internet to upload holiday snaps to @entity121			2
shocked @entity122 , 40 , was landed with the massive bill , which is 28 times the amount she paid for her holiday , when she decided to share photos of her trip to @entity11 on the social network			2
but by using her @entity33 mobile internet to upload the pictures , she ran up data roaming charges which worked out at huge £ 2,700 per day			1
@entity122 , of @entity133 , @entity134 , had planned for her trip by buying £ 6 per day ' travel saver ' mobile internet bundle from her network provider			0
