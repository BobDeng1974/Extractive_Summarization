by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 13 march 2012 updated : 10:35 est , 13 march 2012 social services and other agencies ' poorly managed ' the care of a 10 - year - old boy who hanged himself in his bedroom , a report has concluded			1
@entity7 , a cousin of @entity9 singer @entity8 , was ' a sad , lonely and extremely anxious child ' but there was no evidence his situation was ' demonstrably improved ' by the authorities			1
the youngster was discovered in his locked room at his home in @entity17 , @entity18 on september 19 2010			0
@entity7 , left , a cousin of @entity9 singer @entity8 , right , was described as ' a sad , lonely and extremely anxious child ' in the report he was a twice - removed cousin on his father ’s side of @entity23 , the frontman for the 1990s chart - toppers			1
last march an inquest heard how @entity7 was diagnosed with clinical depression and attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder and was prescribed an anti-depressant , and a psychostimulant drug			1
he had attempted self - harm and was also the victim of bullying			1
a serious case review by the @entity35 was ordered following his death			2
@entity7 , referred to as @entity37 in the review published today , was first referred to @entity39 ( @entity39 ) by his gp in 2007 having been found with a plastic bag on his head and reported to have said that he wanted to die			1
he was not seen for psychiatric assessment and instead was offered a programme of undirected play therapy , despite fears being voiced by his mother , the report said			2
the youngster was referred back to @entity50 in early 2010 having again been found with a bag over his head and having stated he wanted to end his life			1
@entity7 , pictured when he was younger , was referred to mental health authorities in early 2010 having again been found with a bag over his head and having stated he wanted to end his life he was seen by a child psychiatrist who diagnosed a major depressive disorder and at the same time was also referred to children ’s services by his school			1
he was then the subject of regular multi-agency involvement up to the point of his death			2
the independent report said : ' the panel was of the view that @entity37 ’s case was generally poorly managed by the key agencies			1
there was evidence of poor practice throughout , which included both single agency failings and generally poor inter-agency communication and collaborative working			0
' practice was considered to be largely adult rather than child - focused and there was no evidence of @entity37 ’s voice being heard or his wishes and feelings taken into account by professionals working with him and his family			0
' the report added @entity7 was ' extremely vulnerable ' and felt ' unloved and unwanted ' , caused by ' his parents ’ inability or unwillingness to recognise his needs and put them before their own '			1
@entity7 was discovered in his locked room at his home in @entity17 , @entity18 ( town centre pictured ) on september 19 2010 he was in need of therapy and protection from his parents but neither was recognised or met , despite him being known to a number of agencies			1
the report concluded : ' it was the view of the panel that no single agency was responsible for failing to protect @entity37 from the chronic emotional abuse and neglect that he suffered			0
' it felt , however , that the failure of @entity39 to identify @entity37 as a likely high risk of suicide at the second presentation in 2010 , produce an accurate formulation of risk and take the lead in developing a multi-agency risk management plan was a fundamental omission which impacted significantly on the responses of other agencies to child @entity120 ’s difficulties			1
' last year @entity18 coroner @entity121 ruled out suicide and , in a narrative verdict , said @entity7 died as a consequence of his own actions without understanding the true consequences			2
the inquest heard that it was difficult to say how the drugs affected @entity7 ’s state of mind but their influence could not be excluded			2
the levels of both drugs found in his system were above the normal therapeutic level for adults			0
mr @entity121 said he did not criticise their prescription in @entity7 ’s circumstances , nor did he argue that the drugs should not be used by children			2
but he pointed out that doctors must be ' extremely careful ' in prescribing powerful drugs to 10 - year - olds			2
addressing the subject , the serious case review found : ' the issues in relation to the use of such medication and the complexities involved in treating co-morbidities remain unresolved			0
this is clearly a national issue and central government guidance is needed to inform and direct future medical practice			0
' in a statement , @entity35 said all agencies involved ' deeply regret that this tragic event happened '			0
it continued ; ' the report makes a number of different recommendations for how we should all improve our practice			0
many of these relate to issues around how agencies assess the needs of children and in particular how they respond to evidence of self - harm or threats of suicide in children			1
' we believe the key lessons which are common to all agencies are : the child must always be at the centre of our work and should be asked directly about their care and their feelings ; we should always take threats of suicide seriously - this applies not just to agencies and professionals , but to families and communities ; multiple medications to children should be carefully prescribed and monitored			1
' full and comprehensive action plans have been produced in line with the recommendations of the review			0
@entity35 will be overseeing progress on these plans , and holding the agencies to account for completing them			0
' many of the actions have been implemented , and the remainder are well on their way to completion			0
the changes made will improve the quality of services provided to children and families in @entity18			0
