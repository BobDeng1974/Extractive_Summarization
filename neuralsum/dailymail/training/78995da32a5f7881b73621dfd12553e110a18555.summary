five s - 300 missile systems , capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles , could be supplied to @entity4 a @entity18 source said that the offer could be made when @entity0 meets @entity4 's new president @entity7 for the first time on friday the deal , revealed by a @entity18 source to @entity1 's @entity24 newspaper , would include @entity1 building a second reactor at @entity4 's only nuclear plant in @entity27			1
the source told @entity24 that @entity1 's offer would depend on @entity4 's withdrawing a $ 4billion lawsuit that it has lodged at an international court in @entity32 against @entity1 's arms export agency			1
also speaking in @entity24 , @entity0 's spokesman @entity34 said that @entity0 and @entity7 were expected to discuss ' working together in the nuclear energy sphere ' and ' questions of military technical cooperation ' at the summit in @entity39			0
the renewed deal will anger both @entity41 and @entity42 who forced @entity1 to drop it in 2010 the move will anger @entity41 and @entity42 who , in 2010 , forced @entity1 's then - president @entity46 to cancel the arms deal following heavy diplomatic pressure			2
@entity1 risks straining relations with the @entity41 having just assuaged @entity41 over the @entity51 crisis following a tense meeting at the @entity54 summit in @entity55			0
@entity4 is a staunch ally of @entity51 and president @entity57 and has taken its diplomatic lead from @entity1 during the crisis in calling for a halt to talk of military action and insisting on a diplomatic solution			0
however , @entity63 , the head of @entity4 's elite @entity64 fighting unit , has said that @entity4 would support @entity51 ' until the end ' in the face of military action			0
@entity1 will also expect international condemnation if it starts construction on a second nuclear reactor at @entity27			2
a second nuclear reactor could be built in @entity4 if the deal goes ahead @entity4 's only working nuclear facility was completed by @entity1 and began operating in 2011 after a series of setbacks and sabotages , most notably the @entity79 virus which was thought to have shut it down for several months			1
despite repeated assurances from @entity84 that the facility is only for peaceful power generation , @entity82 countries remain deeply sceptical .			0

renewed 2010 deal could see five missiles worth $ 800million sold to @entity4
*rumors* that @entity1 will also build second nuclear reactor inside country
@entity18 source called the deal ' not particularly *profitable* *...* but rather *political* . '
