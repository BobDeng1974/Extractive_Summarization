by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 03:49 est , 21 january 2013 @entity1 is launching a new file sharing website called @entity3 exactly a year after the @entity4 shut down his old site @entity6 and charged him with online piracy			1
@entity1 , who is currently on bail and faces jail if found guilty , said the new site was not revenge on @entity13 authorities who planned a raid on his Â£ 16million @entity17 mansion			1
@entity1 said his new offering , @entity3 , which will launch on sunday , complied with the law and warned that attempts to take it down would be futile			1
defiant : @entity1 is launching a new file sharing website called @entity3 exactly a year after the @entity4 shut down his old site @entity6 and charged him with online piracy ' this is not some kind of finger to the @entity13 government or to @entity28 ' @entity1 told @entity29 at his sprawling estate in the bucolic hills of @entity32 , just outside @entity33 , @entity17 , a country known more for sheep , rugby and the @entity36 than flamboyant tech tycoons			1
' legally , there 's just nothing there that could be used to shut us down			2
this site is just as legitimate and has the right to exist as @entity45 , @entity46 and other competitors , ' he said , referring to other popular cloud storage services			1
@entity1 and three colleagues are currently awaiting the result of an appeal over an extradition order from @entity17 to the @entity13			1
his lawyer , @entity53 , added that launching the site was compliant with the terms of @entity1 's bail conditions			1
@entity13 prosecutors argue that @entity1 in a statement said he had no intention of starting a new internet business until his extradition was resolved			2
@entity1 said @entity3 was a different beast to @entity6 , as the new site enables users to control exactly which users can access uploaded files , in contrast to its predecessor , which allowed users to search files , some of which contained copyrighted content , allegedly without permission			1
a sophisticated encryption system will allow users to encode their files before they upload them on to the site 's servers , which @entity1 said were located in @entity17 and overseas			1
each file will then be issued a unique , sophisticated decryption key which only the file holder will control , allowing them to share the file as they choose			2
new venture : dotcom insists his new offering , @entity3 , which will launch on sunday , complied with the law and warned that attempts to take it down would be futile tweets : dotcom announces the launch of new site mega on @entity96 as a result , the site 's operators would have no access to the files , which they say would strip them from any possible liability for knowingly enabling users to distribute copyright - infringing content , which @entity106 says is illegal			1
' even if we wanted to , we ca n't go into your file and snoop and see what you have in there , ' @entity1 added			2
@entity1 said @entity3 would comply with orders from copyright holders to remove infringing material , which will afford it the ' safe harbour ' legal provision , which minimises liability on the condition that a party acted in good faith to comply			2
but some legal experts say it may be difficult to claim the protection if they do not know what users have stored			0
the @entity127 said encrypting files alone would not protect @entity1 from liability			0
' we 'll reserve final judgment until we have a chance to analyse the new project , ' a spokesman told @entity29			0
" but given @entity1 's history , count us as sceptical			0
' the @entity136 national , who also goes by @entity1 , expects huge interest in its first month of operation , which would be a far cry from when @entity6 went live in 2005			0
' i would be surprised if we had less than one million users , ' @entity1 said			0
@entity141 , who also goes by the name @entity1 , expects huge interest in his new site @entity3 's launch starts the next chapter of the @entity1 narrative , dotted with previous cyber crime - related arrests and whose twists and turns have been scrutinised by all facets of the entertainment industry , from film studios and record labels to internet service companies and teenage gamers			1
the copyright infringement case , billed as the largest to date given that @entity6 in its heyday commanded around four percent of global online traffic , could set a precedent for internet liability laws and depending on its outcome , may force entertainment companies to rethink their distribution methods			0
a year on , the extradition hearing has been delayed until august , complicated by illegal arrest warrants and the @entity17 government 's admission that it had illegally spied on @entity1 , who has residency status in the country			1
last january , @entity17 's elite special tactics forces landed by helicopter at dawn in the grounds of @entity1 's mansion , worth roughly $ 16 million and featuring a servants ' wing , hedge maze and life - size statues of giraffes and a rhinoceros , to arrest him and his colleagues at the request of the @entity4			1
police armed with semi-automatic weapons found @entity1 cowering alone in a panic room in the attic , while outside , a convoy of police cars and vans pulled up in the driveway			0
around 70 officers took part in the raid			1
they left with computers , files and some of @entity1 's fleet of @entity201 , @entity202 and a vintage pink cadillac tricked with personalised licence plates screaming ' @entity205 ' , ' evil ' , and ' mafia '			0
' every time you hear a helicopter , you automatically think , ' oh , another raid ' , so it 's something that stays with you for a long time , " said @entity1 , who says he and his wife still panic when they hear sudden , loud noises in the house			2
@entity1 was coy about the details of the launch party as builders put the finishing touches to a festival - sized concert stage in the mansion 's grounds , while two helicopters circled overhead			2
but if the impromptu , @entity225 - styled ice cream social he threw in @entity33 earlier in the week is any indication , the party could be a more wholesome affair compared with the well - documented soirees of @entity1 's past , where nightclubs , hot tubs and scantily clad women were a common fixture			0
' i had to grow up , you know , i was a big baby , ' he said			0
' big baby with too much money usually leads to baby craziness			0
' i am going to be more of a person that wants to help to make things better and help internet innovation to take off without all these restrictions by governments			0
that is going to be my primary goal if this business is successful			0
