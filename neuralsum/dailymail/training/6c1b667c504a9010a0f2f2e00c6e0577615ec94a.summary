by @entity0 a former policeman who claimed a £ 5,000 insurance payout for whiplash injuries was filmed cage fighting days after the alleged car crash , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity7 , 31 , said he had neck injuries so severe he was unable to take care of himself or his son			2
however , after making his claim , an insurance company worker spotted a newspaper article showing @entity14 taking part in a professional heavyweight cage fight in @entity17			2
he insists the accident was genuine and he was pressured into the fight fight : mr @entity7 ' lawyers argued that the ' annals of sporting history ' were full of stories of people who fought on despite serious injuries			1
at an earlier hearing his claim for £ 5,000 compensation was thrown out the fight , which was just 13 days after the alleged crash , was broadcast on television			1
the footage shows the @entity40 bouncer , who was also a special forces soldier and policeman in @entity43 , lifting his opponent off the ground , holding him in a head lock and hitting him around the head			0
@entity48 is pursuing contempt of court proceedings over the ‘ contrived ’ accident in @entity51 , @entity52 , in may 2010			1
court : the former member of @entity56 police and special forces outside the @entity58 if convicted , @entity7 , of @entity59 , @entity60 , could face prison			1
the insurers ’ barrister , @entity62 , told the @entity58 in @entity52 yesterday there was ‘ no bona fide accident ’			0
‘ what made this particular fraud memorable was film of mr @entity7 engaging in a cage fight 13 days after the alleged accident , ’ he said			1
he also said that a @entity72 insured by @entity73 , which @entity7 said damaged his @entity74 , could not have done so			0
he added : ‘ mr @entity7 maintained as part of his claim that he suffered a neck injury in the alleged accident that restricted his ability to look after his child , engage in @entity81 , lift heavy items , or manage his personal care for a month afterwards			2
’ he also insisted his injuries ‘ prevented him from being able to go to his gym , and swim or play football for three months after the alleged accident ’			0
@entity90 ’ barrister @entity89 insisted he had suffered a genuine whiplash injury but took part in the fight as he needed the money and had contractual obligations to do so			0
‘ looking at this superficially , it might bring a smile to your face due to the irony that a man should suffer a neck injury , bring a personal injury claim , and then find himself involved in a professional fight within a few days , ’ he said			0
postponed : the @entity56 national was allowed to have today 's hearing adjourned to secure an interpreter televised : a county court judge last may was shown the footage of the cage fight in @entity17 , pictured ‘ there was a purse available , tickets had been sold and a promoter had promoted him			1
’ after yesterday ’s hearing , @entity7 , who was beaten in the cage fight within a minute and a half , said : ‘ i swear on my children ’s lives that i had that accident			1
’ in may last year , a judge at @entity123 , in east @entity52 , dismissed his compensation claim – ruling that the road shunt probably ‘ never happened ’			0
this paved the way for @entity73 to seek @entity90 ’ committal on grounds of contempt of court , and the case reached the @entity58 yesterday as the insurers ’ lawyers tried to get their case underway			2
but it was adjourned to allow @entity7 to get full legal representation , organise his case and find an interpreter			0

@entity7 , 31 , claimed £ 5,000 compensation after accident in 2010
but a judge threw out damages bid after watching fight on tv
@entity56 claimed he was under pressure from his manager not to pull out
his lawyers say sporting history is full of people fighting on through pain
@entity48 urged the judge to jail @entity14 for contempt of court
