it takes dedication to follow in the footsteps of your hero - particularly if that hero happens to be global explorer and adventurer sir @entity7			1
but after 30 years travelling thousands of miles and at an estimated cost of Â£ 100,000 , @entity8 says he has re-traced almost every journey taken by the famous @entity12			2
the 57 - year - old teacher has visited 42 countries over three decades since becoming obsessed with @entity7 as a schoolboy			1
adventure : @entity8 has spent his adult life re-tracing the journey 's of sir @entity7 all over the globe he claims to have ticked off 98 per cent of the destinations reached by @entity7 in the 16th century and has just two trips left to complete his mission - the @entity23 and @entity24 off @entity25			1
since the start of his adventures , mr @entity8 has been jailed in @entity28 , almost lost his ear to a knife attack in @entity31 , hacked through jungles and dived 170 feet off the coast of @entity34 in a bid to see @entity7 's final resting place - his lead - lined coffin			1
the supply teacher said : ' i have certainly had some experiences			2
' in february mr @entity8 visited @entity34 for the tenth time where he cut his way along a 16th - century trail to reach the ruined settlement deep in the heart of the rainforest which @entity7 raided in 1571			1
he said : ' we had to deal with mud , sweat , cuts , exhaustion , thirst , blisters , bruised toes , mosquitoes , poisonous vipers and scorpions			0
' the crowning glory was to traverse a steeply undulating ridge with no water supplies to reach the @entity61 from where @entity7 saw the @entity64 and @entity65 oceans			0
' this was a pivotal moment in @entity68 history when @entity7 was inspired to sail a ship into the @entity65 which led to him circumnavigating the world			0
' hero : mr @entity8 idolised ( right ) the adventurer as a child , and learned a different @entity7 ( left ) story every year as he grew up he continued : ' this became the most famous voyage in @entity68 history and stimulated @entity68 to beat the @entity78 of 1588 and to become the world 's most powerful navy			1
' this was the first expedition to identify this @entity7 landmark and to visit it since february 1572			0
' despite @entity7 being a famous sailor , mr @entity8 tackles most of his adventures on foot , flying into ports and islands @entity7 visited before trekking through jungles or along coastlines to stand on the very spot his hero visited 440 years ago			1
he has just two trips left to tackle , but is hoping for government help and extra funds to finally tick them off his list			2
sir @entity7 was the first @entity95 to circumnavigate the world and second - in - command of the @entity68 fleet against the @entity78 in 1588			2
it is said that prior to the battle he was playing a game of bowls on @entity103 , and when warned of the enemy 's approach declared there was plenty of time to finish the game and still beat the @entity110			0
mr @entity8 , who lives in @entity111 in @entity112 , and teaches @entity113 and @entity114 tried to visit @entity115 and @entity116 off the coast of the @entity23 in 2008 , but nobody was willing to take him out on a boat without an official letter from the @entity122 government			1
he is currently appealing to his mp for help			0

mr @entity8 , who is not married , became obsessed with the 16th century sea captain at the age of eight when he first heard about his explorations at school			1

' then i read his biographies as a teenager and when i was 24 i saw @entity7 's portrait in @entity154			0
' i was thrilled to be on the same piece of turf as him all those miles from home			0
