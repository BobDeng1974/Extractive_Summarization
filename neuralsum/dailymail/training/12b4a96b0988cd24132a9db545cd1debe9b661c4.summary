but all that could be about to change following the arrival of a fake tan which can be applied at home , but keeps skin golden for as long as three weeks			1
the @entity10 tanning mousse claims to be the first home tan which looks as good and lasts for longer than a professional salon spray			1
and it has also won a celebrity following , with actress @entity15 , model @entity24 and singer @entity16 among its customers			1
the tan contains a secret formulation of natural ingredients which works with dihydroxyacetone ( @entity32 ) , the main ingredient in fake tans which reacts with melanin in the skin to colour it , and makes the tan last longer			2
tanning : phenomenal tanning mousse is said to give the skin a golden glow for up to three weeks the mousse dries almost instantly and is odourless , so users avoid the sticky skin and sickly sweet smell of traditional fake tans			1
@entity47 , founder and chief executive of creators @entity50 , said : ‘ it took us 14 months , but the tan we have come up with is the safest , most organic tan on the market			2

’ scientists have recently clashed over the safety of @entity32 , a naturally occurring chemical found in sugar which is used in all fake tans , after a @entity71 study linked it to cancer			0
mrs @entity47 added : ‘ the studies linking fake tan to cancer are a red herring			0
there is no evidence to show @entity32 causes cancer			0
