twice as many state secondary schools are now considered to be underperforming compared with last year after a crackdown on the exams system			1
league tables , published yesterday , show 330 schools fell below the government ’s ‘ floor target ’ for gcse results in 2014 , up from 154 in 2013			1
in those schools , fewer than 40 per cent of pupils gained at least five c grades at @entity11 , including @entity12 and maths			1
pupils were also judged to have made poor progress in these two subjects			0
the increase is because of new @entity30 rules which ban schools from including results from re-sits and poor - quality vocational courses			1
they remove the incentive for schools to encourage students to re-sit exams and study easier subjects			1
the league tables are based on data provided by the @entity48 and show how every school and college in @entity12 performed at @entity11 , a-level and other academic and vocational qualifications in 2014			1
the number of pupils entering the @entity55 rose by 71 per cent compared with four years before , meaning that there are now 89,874 more youngsters taking it than in 2010			1
@entity60 's top private schools have plummeted to the bottom of the league tables because of new rules governing which qualifications count			1
around 335 schools – including @entity20 , @entity18 and @entity66 – registered 0 per cent for the proportion of pupils gaining at least five c grades at @entity11 including @entity12 and maths			2
under the shake - up , some @entity71 and some international gcses do not count in the rankings			2
many private schools favour @entity76 , saying they are more rigorous			1
the @entity77 ’ and @entity78 ’ conference , which represents 270 independent schools , said the decision to drop @entity76 means the tables ‘ have become a nonsense ’			1
a @entity48 spokesman said : ‘ we have stripped out qualifications that were of little value			2
’ more than 300 schools fell beneath the government 's minimum target to ensure that enough pupils get five good gcses following former education secretary @entity93 's reforms deputy prime minister @entity94 said some schools appear to have been ' caught out ' by the change in the way standards were measured the @entity55 is a performance measure of core academic subjects that recognises students who achieve at least a c at @entity11 in @entity12 , maths , two sciences , history or geography and a language			1
the changes to the exam criteria were criticised by the @entity110 , which said they had ‘ tripped up ’ secondary schools			2
general secretary @entity112 said : ‘ many of these changes disproportionately affected schools working with the most disadvantaged students			2
‘ it is now time for the government to stop interfering in examinations on ministerial whim and let schools focus on teaching			2
’ but @entity122 told @entity123 : ‘ what we ’ve done as a government is we ’ve been more intolerant of failure in schools , and we ’ve raised the bar			0
‘ that ’s why the figures do show some results that are disappointing , because we ’re being frank and saying look , let ’s not hide problems , let ’s identify schools that are not working properly and let ’s turn them around			1
’ education secretary @entity139 said : ‘ for too long pupils were offered courses of no value to them and schools felt pressured to enter young people for exams before they were ready			0
’ sixth - formers are now studying more a-levels in rigorous subjects favoured by leading universities			0
in what will be seen as a vindication for @entity93 , an increasing number of pupils appear to be shunning softer choices for ‘ facilitating subjects ’			0
these subjects , which are required most often by @entity158 universities , include @entity12 literature , maths , physics , biology , chemistry , geography , history and languages			0
figures from the @entity48 show that overall there were 407,600 a-level entries in these subjects in 2014 , up 20,000 compared with four years before			0
the figures also indicate a rise in the number of students – particularly girls – studying maths and the sciences			0
there were just over 79,000 entries for maths last year , up 9,000 compared with 2010			0
among girls alone , 6,423 took physics @entity180 last year , up from 5,689 in 2010 , while the percentage of teenage girls taking maths was up 7.3 per cent on 2010			0
the results come after a drive to encourage state school pupils to study more rigorous subjects , which was led by mr @entity93 when he was education secretary			0
addressing his critics while still in post , he said : ‘ academic rigour is liberating , not limiting			0
students with good passes , especially in traditional subjects , have more opportunities in life			0

league tables show 330 schools have fallen below @entity30 targets
the underperforming number is more than double last year 's figure
@entity60 's top private schools have plummeted to bottom of league tables
this was *due* to new rules governing which qualifications count
