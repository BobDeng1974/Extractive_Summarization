by @entity0 lipstick ban : flight attendants on @entity3 have been ordered not to wear red lipstick or nail polish in a move attacked as ' too religious ' female flight attendants at @entity9 ’s national airline have been banned from wearing red lipstick and nail polish , prompting renewed fears from secular @entity9 the country is becoming more @entity14			1
@entity3 , @entity15 's fourth - biggest carrier , said the ban was aimed at keeping crews ' artless and well - groomed with makeup in pastel tones ' because a natural look improved communication with passengers			1
but critics say it reflects the creeping influence of the government 's @entity14 values			0
the new rule will be imposed just one year after the airline lifted its ban on headscarves among its staff			2
‘ this new guideline is totally down to @entity3 management 's desire to shape the company to fit its own political and ideological stance , ’ @entity33 , the president of @entity3 ' worker 's union , said			2
‘ no one can deny that @entity9 has become a more conservative , religious country			1
’ @entity9 is 99 per cent @entity43 , but the @entity45 state and @entity47 candidate has a secular constitution			1
there have been concerns in recent years that an increasingly wealthy but pious middle - class is emerging in @entity9 that wants to practise its religion more freely			2
prime minister @entity54 's ruling @entity53 , which traces its roots to a banned @entity14 party , has also come under strong pressure from grassroots supporters to relax the state 's control over the expression of religion			0
such restrictions were aimed at reining in @entity64 and improving women 's rights , but effectively prevented many devout women from studying at university or taking government jobs			0
mr @entity54 , whose wife @entity69 wears a headscarf , has previously said he is committed to secularism , but does not believe it should be at the expense of those who want to express their religious beliefs			0
@entity3 cabin crew in 1974 : the company saidn the ban on red lipstick and nail polish was brought in simply because staff no longer wear red uniforms and not for any religious reason conservative control : @entity3 have been accused of imposing conservative @entity64 views on their staff by preventing them from wearing the makeup of their choice @entity3 defended its new rule , saying : ' as a consequence of our current cabin uniforms not including red , dark pink , etc. , the use of lipstick and nail polish in these colours by our cabin crew impairs visual integrity , ' it sent social networks into a frenzy , with many women posting pictures of themselves with red lips in protest			1
one wrote : ‘ why not just ban stewardesses altogether so we can all breathe a sigh of relief ? ’ some male @entity114 users were indignant over the insinuation that red lipstick would induce a sexual frenzy			1
' they are objecting to the lipstick and nail polish that we have been using for years , ' said @entity121 , 30 , a former @entity3 ' flight attendant who lost her job with more than 300 others last year during a union protest			1

prime minister @entity54 , whose wife @entity69 ( pictured ) wears a headscarf , said he is committed to secularism , but not at the expense of those who want to express their religious beliefs @entity9 's prime minister @entity54 has said he is committed to secularism @entity9 has remained a secular consitution since the modernising reforms of @entity135 , who threw religion out of public life in the 1920s and 1930s as he rebuilt @entity9 from the ruins of the @entity140			2
the powerful military views itself as the ultimate guarantor of @entity9 's secular order and has ousted four democratically elected governments in the past 50 years , most recently in 1997 when with public support it drove out a cabinet it viewed as too @entity64			1
the current government , led by @entity54 , is run by the @entity43 @entity53 which has its roots in a banned @entity14 movement			1
he is currently serving his third term as prime minister heading the conservative faith based @entity53 , also known as the @entity53			0
he founded the @entity53 in 2001 upon his release from prison where the former mayor of @entity159 , served ten months for reciting an illegal @entity64 poem during a public address in the province of @entity163			0
as he was banned from public office following the speech including the poem , he could not become prime minister when the party won the general election in 2002 , a ban which was lifted in 2003			0
however , under @entity54 ’s leadership the country has relaxed restrictions on religious expression , including lifting the ban on head scarves in courts and schools			0
@entity3 passenger @entity178 , 33 , said he did not think the new guideline was a sign of creeping islamisation but that the ban was still ‘ absurd			2
’ ‘ i 've never heard of a plane crashing because of a women 's lipstick , ’ he said before his flight			0
the company caused a stir earlier this year after mockups of a new @entity140 - style uniform were leaked online			0
the uniform for stewardesses , which featured loose - fitting ankle - length dresses and fez - style hats , were criticised for being too conservative and were branded ' a joke ' by @entity9 designers , saying they misrepresented the country			1
' the clothes look like they belong to @entity198 or @entity199			0
however , they should reflect @entity9 and @entity9 is not this , ' designer @entity200 told @entity203			2
in response to the critique , @entity3 said the design was not the final product and the conservative uniform never materialised			1
@entity14 is the main religion in @entity9 with 99 per cent of the population identifying themselves as @entity43 , including those who define themselves as secular with a @entity43 background			1
despite this , the tradition of wearing a headscarf , a practice associated with @entity14 which is followed by many @entity43 women , is banned in a majority of jobs in @entity9			1
@entity9 's constitution prohibits women working in the public sector , such as lawyers , teachers , or anyone working on state premises , from covering their head - a ban which and until 2008 also applied to university students			2
in 2007 prime minister @entity54 , head of the moderately @entity14 @entity53 , tried to lift the ban , but was stopped by @entity9 's @entity230 which ruled that removing the ban was against the founding principles of the constitution			0
however , prime minister @entity54 , who won the 2007 promising to scrap the ban , said last month he did not believe constitutional change was needed to abolish the ban on headscarves in the public sector .			0
