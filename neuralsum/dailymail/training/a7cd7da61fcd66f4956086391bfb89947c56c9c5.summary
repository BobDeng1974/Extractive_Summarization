by @entity0 , science reporter published : 11:53 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 9 may 2013 eating peppers twice a week could help reduce the risk of developing @entity4 by up to a third			1
scientists found individuals who ate foods containing an edible form of nicotine , which also includes tomatoes , potatoes and aubergines , gained a degree of protection against the condition			1
the research adds to evidence linking a reduced risk of the disease with smoking and the use of nicotine patches			2
eating peppers twice a week could help reduce the risk of developing @entity4 by up to a third but experts urged caution , saying other constituents in the produce may have played a role in the findings , while the disease itself may also influence whether people smoke or eat certain foods			1
' our study is the first to investigate dietary nicotine and risk of developing @entity4 , ' said dr @entity38 from the @entity39 in @entity40			2
' similar to the many studies that indicate tobacco use might reduce risk of @entity4 's , our findings also suggest a protective effect from nicotine , or perhaps a similar but less toxic chemical in peppers and tobacco			1
' for the new study , published in the journal @entity53 , 490 patients newly diagnosed with parkinson 's disease , were questioned about their dietary habits and tobacco use			0
a further 644 individuals not suffering from any neurological conditions also participated in the study			0
vegetable consumption in general was not found to affect @entity4 's risk			1
but the likelihood of being diagnosed with @entity4 's reduced the more people ate vegetables from the @entity65 family , which contain tiny amounts of nicotine , the addictive chemical in cigarettes			1
the trend was strongest for peppers , mainly in people with little or no previous exposure to tobacco , with participants who ate them at least twice a week found to be 30 per cent less likely to develop @entity4 's			1
stimulation of nicotine - sensitive receptor molecules in the brain prevents the kind of nerve damage seen in @entity4 's ( pictured ) although the evidence suggests nicotine to be the active ingredient , the team did not rule out another chemical shared by tobacco and its cousins being responsible for the effect			1
one possibility was anatabine , which had anti-inflammatory properties			0
previous experiments in animals , showed stimulation of nicotine - sensitive receptor molecules in the brain prevents the kind of nerve damage seen in @entity4 's			1
human population studies have also found those who smoke are less likely to develop the disease			0
even passive smoking , which involves much less exposure to nicotine , seems to be protective			0
@entity4 's is a progressive condition in which damage to brain cells eventually leads to tremors , rigidity and slow movement , and there is currently no cure			2
most people with the condition are aged 50 or over , and it affects about 127,000 people in @entity115			0
@entity116 , from the charity @entity117 , said the study was too small to draw any concrete conclusions			0
she said : ' this was a small study which involved just over 1,000 people and to produce convincing results , these types of studies really need to involve much larger numbers - tens to hundreds of thousands			0
â€˜ it also studied a relatively young group of people , the average age was mid- 60s , when @entity4 's is a condition which often develops much later in life			2
' at the moment we do n't fully understand the causes of @entity4 's and we do n't know of anything which can prevent the condition , although there are a number of factors that may slightly lower risk including smoking cigarettes , drinking coffee and exercise			1
' dietician @entity142 , from @entity143 in @entity144 , said the study provided further evidence of the benefits of a @entity149 - style diet rich in vegetables such as tomatoes and peppers			0
but she said the findings had ' insufficient robustness ' to justify promoting peppers as a protection against @entity4 's			2
nicotine content can vary in vegetables due to growing conditions , storage , and harvesting and cooking methods .			0

eating foods containing an edible form of nicotine reduces @entity4 's risk
these foods include tomatoes , potatoes , peppers and aubergines
people who smoke or who use nicotine patches are also at lower risk
stimulation of nicotine - sensitive receptor molecules in brain could prevent the nerve damage seen in @entity4 's
