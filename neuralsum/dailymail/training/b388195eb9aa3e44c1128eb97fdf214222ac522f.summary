a mother and her nine - year - old daughter are fighting for life after both being struck down with the same potentially - fatal tumour condition			1
@entity5 , 33 , contracted cavernoma - clusters of abnormal blood vessels - just three months after her daughter @entity8 was diagnosed with the condition for the second time			1
the brave schoolgirl is now fighting for survival yet again after the condition , which is extremely rare in children , left her with a tumour on her brain stem			0
@entity5 , 33 , and her daughter @entity17 , 9 , are both are suffering from the rare and potentially fatal condition cavernoma the condition , called brain stem genetic cavernoma , causes oversized blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that can lead to life - threatening strokes or seizures the mother and daughter describe their condition as a ' ticking time bomb ' because neither know what their outcome will be			1
mrs @entity5 , a horse breeder , said : ' it is an extremely rare condition , particularly in children			1
@entity8 is now in a position where she will either die or they will operate , obviously we hope it is the latter			2
' we are in a position where , when it gets bigger to about 3cm , she dies [ from a haemorrhage ]			0
at the moment it is small , but essentially , @entity8 is a ticking time bomb			2
' as for me , i know i have at least one tumour in my temple lobe which is a dangerous place to have them , and i have one growing at the back of my head			0
' the symptoms include seizures and strokes , so i know at some point i will experience that , i already quite often wake up with my left side is numb			1
' the condition is genetic , meaning that @entity8 's three siblings , @entity59 , 14 , @entity60 , seven , and @entity61 , two , will also have to undergo brain scans			1
they have a 50 per cent chance of developing the condition @entity8 was first diagnosed with the brain stem genetic cavernoma , which causes oversized blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that can lead to life - threatening strokes or seizures , at the age of five			1
cavernomas are clusters of abnormal blood vessels found mainly in the brain and spinal cord			1
they vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres across			0
every year one person in every 400,000 thousand is diagnosed with a cavernoma that is causing symptoms			0
they can run in families - every child of someone with inherited cavernomas has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting the condition			1
nine out of ten cases are not inherited			0
the average age of diagnosis is 40			0
symptoms include seizures , strokes , weakness , slurred speech , numbness , migraines and double vision			1
the main form of treatment is surgery			0
the tiny youngster collapsed and suffered such a huge stroke that doctors had to wait 10 days before carrying out an operation - which only had a two per cent chance of survival			1
but despite beating all the odds for the operation and leading two of years of ' normal ' life , her symptoms returned for a second time just before @entity118 last year			2
her desperate family are now pleading with friends and relatives to help raise money to take @entity8 to a clinic in @entity124 after her doctors said they had run out of options			2
' @entity127 is not on our side at the moment - we know how quickly this grows from when she was five , ' said mrs @entity5			1
' we need to find some solution			0
nobody will ever accept their child will die and if there is any way we can try and give @entity8 the longest future we will			2
' but as she fought for her daughter 's survival , she too was diagnosed with the deadly condition and has been told she faces an inevitable operation			2
she said : ' it has had a massive impact on my life			0
i live with constant migraines , headaches , short term memory loss , falling numb on one side of my body			1
' i need to be fit and healthy and fighting for @entity8 , so i 'm so frustrated to be fighting for myself			2
' mrs @entity5 said : ' i 'm so frustrated i have to be fighting for myself because i need to be fit and healthy and fighting for @entity8 ' in a further devastating development , the family - who are originally from @entity155 , @entity156 , but now run a g√Æte in the south of @entity159 - were told the condition is genetic			1
that means @entity8 's three siblings , @entity59 , 14 , @entity60 , seven , and @entity61 , two , will also have to undergo brain scans			1
they have been told they have a 50 per cent chance of contracting the condition			2
' when it first happened @entity8 was completely paralysed , ' said mrs @entity5 , who is married to property developer @entity169 , 33			1
' we had got to a stage before where she had the operation and was starting to go back to school , but by @entity118 she had really gone downhill again			0
' she had the symptoms of a mini stroke , she was constantly falling over and she had headaches every day			2
' the cavernoma attaches itself all around our veins , they are not cancerous so there is no radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment that can help them			0
' the gene i carry means it is a very aggressive and it does grow and bleed at an impressive rate			0
' the children understand and are aware of it , they expected to be tested but i do n't think it has truly sunk in for them			0
' once reality sets in it will be tough , we give them the best possible life outside of the hospital , we just try and keep life as normal as we possibly can			0
' the alternative is to fall apart , but that is the last thing anybody needs			0
' to donate go to @entity201 /			0
