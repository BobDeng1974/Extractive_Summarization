@entity29 , @entity40 and @entity39 services all incurred costs of more than £ 50,000 over five years			1
it is likely that the total number of calls is even higher than 2,700 , as some services have not kept records of this type of incident			1
at the request of firefighters , a new category of rescuing a ‘ bariatric ’ ( severely obese ) person was added to the @entity54 used by services in @entity35 in april this year			2
three firefighters at @entity58 and @entity59 have suffered muscle strain while trying to move an obese person , area manager @entity56 told @entity62 , which submitted the @entity23 request			2
it is one of several services which has changed its policy to respond instantly only when people need urgent medical attention			1

@entity83 , who weighed 70 stone , was involved in an eight - hour rescue when he needed to get to hospital for a hernia operation			2
he had not left home in two years and the front wall of his flat had to be knocked down and a forklift truck used to get him out			1
he told the programme that he was ‘ embarrassed ’ about what had happened			0
he said : ‘ i thought “ why are they doing it for me ? ” my esteem , the way i thought about myself , was non-existent			0
‘ my eating disorder was way out of control , my depression was severe , and i just did n’t want to get to grips with my life or sort myself out in those days			0
‘ in this country we have a policy where we treat people whatever problems they ’ve got			0
it took a situation like that for me to realise how bad i got myself			0

@entity115 , speaking on behalf of the @entity114 , told the today programme that the figures should make people think about their lifestyles			0
he said : ‘ fire and rescue service are here to help and people find themselves in need of help for a number of reasons			1
they may be medical conditions , they may indeed be lifestyle choices but we do n’t judge we just get on and help people			2
‘ while we do respond to people in need we are actively seeking to reduce demand for this kind of service by encouraging people to act differently			0
‘ prevention is not only better than cure it is very much cheaper than cure			0
in these restricted times financially it is important we drive down demand as much as we can			0
