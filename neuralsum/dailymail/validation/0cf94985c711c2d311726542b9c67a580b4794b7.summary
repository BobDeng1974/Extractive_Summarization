seven members of @entity1 including two @entity3 senators have been caught following an x-rated account on @entity5 , but those whose spokespersons responded to requests for comment say their staff made innocent mistakes			1
the account , calling itself ' @entity12 , ' went dormant in 2013 but promised ' the best orgasm , porn and sex sounds ever ! we will post sex pics too ! ' the sex - themed account uses a sexually graphic photo as its header image			1
its official @entity5 handle , however , is the innocuous - sounding ' @ jukeboxradio2			1
' lawmakers whose official social media accounts followed ' @entity12 ' include @entity28 @entity27 sen. @entity26 and @entity30 @entity29 sen. @entity29 ; @entity27 reps			1
@entity32 of @entity33 , @entity34 of @entity35 and @entity36 of @entity37 ; and @entity29 reps			2

@entity42 : seven members of @entity1 followed a @entity5 account calling itself ' @entity12 , ' and two of them were still doing it – including @entity37 democrat @entity36 – as of thursday at noon @entity46 : @entity37 @entity39 rep. @entity39 also followed the account , but his social media staff unfollowed after @entity49 asked about it rep. @entity39 's office unfollowed the account minutes after @entity49 asked for comment on thursday			1
his spokesman , @entity55 , said in an email that the account had ' tweeted on newsworthy items a couple of years ago			0
since then , they have clearly changed their focus			0
' ' any @entity5 follower can make a similar change at any time , ' @entity55 pointed out , and it is impossible for congressman @entity39 to constantly review tens of thousands of @entity5 followers for any changes they might make to their profiles			2
' ' as soon as the @entity5 handle 's addition of coarse language was brought to the office 's attention , the account was unfollowed			2
' separately , a legislative communications aide who declined to be identified said during a phone interview that a ' mortified ' boss was n't happy			2
' it 's not the kind of thing you like to find out , ' the aide said			0
' not now , not ever			0
' no comment : @entity28 @entity27 sen. @entity26 's office did n't respond to questions about why she had followed a pornographic @entity5 account @entity85 , a spokesman for @entity86 , explained that his boss was at one time in the habit of uncritically following @entity5 accounts that followed his			1
' years ago we had a follow / follow back policy for the @entity5 account , ' @entity85 said in an email , ' but have since revised that policy and have started vetting followers more closely			2
' ' we ’ve un-followed the account in question			0
' @entity99 , chief of staff to rep. @entity100 , issued a denial to a question about how it was possible that her official @entity5 account had followed a porn - oriented user			1
' no idea , and its not , ' @entity99 said in an email			0
but a report just a day ago in @entity109 includes a graphic showing @entity100 was indeed following the account			0
in a follow - up , he said he had learned that ' the person who does our social media now in the office unfollowed upon seeing the [ @entity109 ] story			0
' embarrassing : @entity35 @entity27 rep. @entity34 is still following the ' @entity5 account other lawmakers ' offices did not respond to requests for comment at all			1
by thursday at noon , only @entity34 and @entity36 were still following the salacious account			0
@entity109 reported wednesday that its initial purpose seemed to be harvesting followers for internet radio projects , and then complaining about government regulations that stood in the way of a 10 - year - old @entity130 girl , @entity129 , getting a lung transplant			1
at the time , then - @entity133 secretary @entity132 refused to grant the terminally ill cystic fibrosis patient an exemption to a policy that gave priority to children over age 12			1
ultimately a federal court intervened and @entity129 got two double - lung transplants , and according to @entity142 could breathe 12 hours per day without a ventilator			2
the ' f * * * box radio ' account owner 's temporary interest in health advocacy could explain how seven federal lawmakers were among its fewer than 200 followers .			0

seven @entity29 and @entity27 followed ' @entity12 ' on @entity5
one aide said boss was ' mortified ' and demanded immediate fix
' we give you the best orgasm , porn and sex sounds ever ! we will post sex pics too ! ' the account promised before it went dormant in 2013
@entity164 may have *attracted* lawmakers because it once advocated for a 10 - year - old girl barred by @entity133 from priority status for a lung transplant
