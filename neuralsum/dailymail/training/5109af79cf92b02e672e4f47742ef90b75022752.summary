it was a moment on @entity1 on monday that really set tongues wagging about the prospect of @entity4 moving to @entity5			1
as the @entity7 superstar clicked follow on @entity5 and @entity8 , the chatter about a possible move from the @entity11 to @entity12 on social media understandably grew louder			1
and amidst the turmoil at @entity7 with the dismissal of sporting director @entity19 and the reported fall - out between @entity4 and head coach @entity20 , all of a sudden the prospect of the @entity15 wearing a @entity5 shirt did not seem so unrealistic			1
the fact that @entity4 had just started following former @entity7 team - mate @entity23 on @entity1 was a slight surprise as the two have been good friends for a while , with their respective partners @entity29 and @entity30 also enjoying a close friendship			1

and the relationship between @entity30 and @entity29 may well be a crucial factor if @entity4 was to consider joining @entity5			1
@entity30 and @entity29 have been spotted together in @entity44 in recent months , enjoying shopping trips in @entity63 and in november they were joined by @entity8 for a lunch at a @entity44 restaurant			1
a quick look through their @entity1 pages shows just how close they are and @entity29 would surely find the prospect of living in @entity44 along with her best friend appealing			2
@entity29 ( left ) posted this picture on her @entity1 page during her time in @entity44 with @entity46 in november @entity46 ( left ) posted this picture as she and @entity75 enjoyed a night out with each other in @entity44 @entity29 ( left ) and @entity46 hang out as the close friends enjoy their time together in @entity44 @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 take a selfie as the pair enjoy each other 's company @entity4 celebrates after scoring @entity7 's third goal against @entity83 at the @entity11 on thursday @entity4 scores from the penalty spot during the @entity87 last 16 match against @entity83 if @entity4 was to make a move to @entity44 , the fact he has close friends here would help him settle after living in @entity7 since 2000			1
@entity8 publicly , though , has been careful to play down suggestions that he could be involved in a potential @entity4 move but did acknowledge that he would love to play alongside his mate again			2
the @entity5 midfielder told @entity98 radio program @entity97 on @entity99 : ' i 'm upset that they say that i could be mediating for @entity4 to come to @entity5			2
how can i be talking about contracts ... i 'm only a footballer			0
' he ( @entity4 ) will do what makes him happiest			0
personally , as his friend , colleague and footballer , if you gave me the chance to play with him again , i would welcome it			0
' @entity111 and @entity112 are the only two clubs that could sign @entity4 for an outright fee within @entity115 rules , according to a football finance expert			0
and considering that the prospect of @entity4 moving from @entity7 to their arch rivals is unlikely , then the @entity118 club may be the only realistic destination for the @entity15 if he was to leave the @entity11			0
even then , meeting the 27 - year - old 's wages without breaking @entity125 's @entity115 rules could prove a struggle			0
an offer of £ 196million would meet @entity4 's buy - out clause and oblige @entity7 to sell if it was the player 's will to leave			2
@entity130 , a football finance expert at @entity131 , told the @entity132 : ' with the revenue they generate and cash reserves , only @entity111 and @entity112 could pay the fee			0
' with salary costs probably even they could n't stay within @entity115			0
' if a club exceeds losses of more than £ 23.5m over a three - year period that includes the current campaign , they open themselves to the prospect of sanctions by @entity125			0
a staggered transfer payment could avoid any breach of rules but it is believed that @entity7 would be unlikely to accept this			0
@entity130 said : ' unless @entity4 absolutely wanted to get out of the club , why would @entity7 agree to that ? ' staggering the payments would certainly make it easier for @entity5 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 but @entity111 demanded the fee up front when they sold @entity158 and i strongly suspect it would be the same for @entity4			1

there has been mounting speculation that @entity4 could join @entity5
former @entity7 team - mates @entity4 and @entity8 are friends
their partners @entity29 and @entity30 are also close
@entity30 and @entity29 were spotted together in @entity44 last year
