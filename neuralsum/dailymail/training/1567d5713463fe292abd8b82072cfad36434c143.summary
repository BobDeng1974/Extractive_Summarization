@entity1 ’s travelling circus is still going strong			0
the away days from hell are being offered to @entity4 fans by a rabble of overpaid , under - performing clowns who are simply not prepared to do their jobs properly for the club , the supporters or their manager			1
@entity1 deserves better from these shirkers , who dress up and pretend to be footballers when they travel away from @entity14 this season			0
eleven games on the road in the @entity18 this season , and 11 defeats			1
this useless bunch of wannabes even lost at @entity23 @entity22 in the @entity24			0
@entity25 throws his arms up in the air after @entity4 's latest miserable outing away from @entity14 @entity25 , pictured in action against @entity30 , was responsible for @entity32 's third goal at the @entity33 @entity4 have let @entity1 down this season ; he deserves better why am i picking on the players and not the manager ? just take a look at the ridiculous goals they conceded at @entity32 on saturday			1
for the first @entity42 inexplicably lets the ball run across his body just outside his own box , @entity41 robs him and instantly feeds @entity46 who scores			0
nobody is near @entity46 because @entity4 players have taken up space making themselves available for the ball because they were in possession			1
for the second , @entity53 , an international footballer who played at the @entity54 , was lazy and sloppy in possession , under hit a simple pass in the opposition half , and gave the ball away cheaply			0
now @entity46 is definitely not @entity59 – quite the opposite			0
but with no fewer than four @entity4 players chasing him he still managed to find time and space to score his second			1
those four will be named and shamed : @entity66 was guilty of trotting back ; @entity67 looked like he was towing a caravan with flat tyres through a sea of treacle ; @entity53 chased like a headless chicken to atone for his error ; and @entity42 was in the vicinity but did n’t exactly bust a gut			0
@entity46 completes his hat - trick against @entity4 with a header from close range the @entity32 striker wheels away in celebration after completing his treble against a poor @entity4 side the third was a joke			1
@entity32 launched a free - kick from close to the halfway line into the box			2
@entity25 was outwitted by @entity88			0
@entity25 was n’t concentrating , @entity88 got goal - side of him , and in his desperate attempts to recover the situation after he had dozed off , @entity25 launched himself at the ball , but only succeeded in heading it across his own penalty area straight into the path of @entity46 , hungry for a hat - trick			0
while @entity25 looked stupid , @entity97 looked feeble : as @entity46 closed in on the ball , he was side by side with the @entity4 substitute			2
the @entity101 makes a limp , pathetic attempt to beat @entity46 to the ball , leaning into the @entity32 striker who probably did n’t even realise he was there			2
the @entity4 man is brushed aside like he does n’t exist			2
@entity107 tweeted that @entity4 have good players , who fight			1
he failed to mention on social media that quite a lot of them fail to do their jobs properly and fail to give their all for the cause			0
@entity30 shields the ball from @entity53 , who needs to do a better job looking after it @entity66 looks on in disappointment after @entity32 's opening goal at the @entity33 so before these @entity4 wasters even got into their luxury expensive cars and headed to training this week , i hope they implore themselves to do the following : can any of this shower look @entity1 in the eye ? a manager who took a team from the bottom three to the quarter - finals of the @entity131 in a short space of time , a manager who has won more in @entity136 football than all of these players put together			1
these are players who were not professional enough in their work on saturday , and i suspect they and some others could be accused of shirking responsibilities in all their away games this season			2
the @entity4 players are letting their extremely generous chairman down			1
they ’re letting the fans down and they ’re in danger of taking @entity4 down			1
it seems the only thing this embarrassment of players will succeed in doing is tarnishing @entity1 ’s proud managerial record .			0

@entity4 have lost all 11 of their @entity18 games on the road this term
fans are being *subjected* to *performances* from under - performing clowns
just take a look at the ridiculous goals they conceded at @entity32
@entity4 players are letting the supporters and chairman @entity107 down
