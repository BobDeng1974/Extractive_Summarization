to the lonely would - be agent preparing for a mission behind @entity5 lines , the glamorous @entity0 with the confiding manner offered the enticing prospect of some friendly female company			1
but the elegantly - dressed journalist who haunted the bars of upmarket hotels in wartime @entity11 was not all she seemed			1
‘ @entity17 ’ was an agent provocatrice employed by @entity14 spymasters to test out trainee agents before they were sent out to occupied @entity16			1
and , as her official file released today reveals , she all too often succeeded in getting them to ‘ spill the beans ’ and blow their cover stories			1
she was an agent provocatrice employed by @entity14 spymasters to test out trainee agents before they were sent out to occupied @entity16 after retiring from the service , agent @entity30 – as she was codenamed – lived quietly in the @entity31 , devoting her time to animal welfare and tending her garden			1
now nearly 70 years after the war , her existence as a spy has been confirmed			2
her file is among 3,300 intelligence and security documents from the @entity40 being made available for the first time online by the @entity42 in @entity43			2
@entity17 was not her real name , but part of an elaborate false identity created by the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) – @entity14 ’s @entity40 sabotage organisation			1
born @entity25 – the daughter of an @entity11 father and a @entity51 mother – she first came to the attention of the @entity47 in 1941 after escaping from a prison camp in @entity0 and helping a badly - injured @entity55 airman escape back to @entity11			1
spies : the @entity57 at @entity58 in the @entity59 , where the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) – @entity14 ’s @entity40 sabotage organisation - was located she was given the job of testing trainees at @entity47 ’s ‘ finishing school ’ at @entity58 to see if they were capable of maintaining their cover stories			1
a report from october 1942 noted that she was perfectly suited for targeting trainees in ‘ expensive or flashy hotels and bars ’ to see if she could get them to talk – and all too often succeeded			1
one hapless agent , codenamed @entity74 , ‘ never showed any signs of suspicion at all ’ , she reported			2
‘ throughout the conversation he does not seem to have been aware that he was being questioned methodically and maliciously , although i tried to make it as obvious as possible			2
’ @entity30 eventually began to feel sorry for those she had deceived with her ‘ obvious and primitive trap ’			2
‘ i am at times inclined to think the use of so malicious a ruse distasteful , ’ she wrote			2
but she insisted there was an ‘ absolute fairness ’ to her methods , arguing that it would help trainee spies to ‘ outwit all the @entity85 they are likely to meet in their future career ’			1
‘ compared to what is most likely to happen in the field , it is very mild and innocent			0
it would be a pity to have to give up this method , because it does give the students a good chance of using their brains ( or just their low cunning ) , ’ she wrote			0
trainees later got wise to her methods , and a report from september 1943 noted that many students ‘ resist her blandishments ’ and only open up when they realise the exercise is over			2
when mp @entity107 was given the role of heading up the @entity47 , @entity109 told him to ' set @entity16 ablaze ' after @entity0 fell to the @entity110 in 1940 , @entity109 set up the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , a new unit designed to operate with resistance movements behind enemy lines			1
the @entity47 was charged with bringing chaos and death to @entity5 armies across the continent			0
when @entity107 was appointed head of the organisation , @entity109 told him to ' set @entity16 ablaze '			0
operating out of two family properties on @entity121 , throughout late 1940 the @entity47 began recruiting new agents and purchasing properties across the @entity14 to train them in			1
while the senior staff was almost entirely made up of @entity128 graduates , the agents themselves included a chef , an electrician , and the daughter of a @entity133 motor - car dealer			0
film - makers and makeup artists were installed at @entity136 , a property in @entity138 , to work on disguises , while at @entity142 , near @entity143 , @entity141 university graduates worked on ingenious weapons			0
between them , these two teams created the single shot cigarette pistol , hollowed out tree trunks used to store radios , a camel dung roadside bomb , and carborundum - a grease designed to lock up the wheels of trains			0
by mid- 1941 , the @entity47 were operating inside @entity0 and their first real success came in june when they blew up the @entity156 power station in @entity157 , halting production at a @entity110 u-boat factory and bringing the region 's electric trains to a standstill			1
however , other security services were hostile towards the @entity47			0
the head of the @entity166 branded them ' amateur , dangerous , and bogus '			0
despite this mistrust , the @entity47 went on to prove vital to the war effort			0
in 1942 agents assassinated @entity172 's deputy , @entity171 , using a grenade			0
the same year they also destroyed the @entity175 rail bridge , cutting @entity177 's desert army off from reinforcements			0
the following year agents also destroyed the heavy water plant at @entity181 , ending the @entity5 atomic programme , and on @entity183 in 1944 they used carborundum to halt trains bringing 2nd @entity186 to the beaches			0
in total their attacks delayed the crack division by 17 days , by which time the @entity190 had gained a firm foothold in @entity0			1
after the war the @entity47 was left without a clear role			0
facing internal hostility from other security services , and with their biggest champion @entity109 voted out of office in 1945 , the unit was disbanded in 1946 .			0
