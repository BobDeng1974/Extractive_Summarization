by @entity0 published : 17:49 est , 7 may 2012 updated : 05:38 est , 8 may 2012 @entity1 continued to ask his elderly heiress - turned benefactor for millions long after his failed bid for the presidency ended , even asking for $ 3million just months before he was indicted for corruption			1
another witness , @entity1 ' former friend @entity6 , recounted a conversation that he had with him in 2008 , where he said that it would be as easy as a ' chip shot ' for @entity10 , a rich heiress , to fund a foundation for $ 50million			1
a year later , after news of his affair with @entity15 became public and his onetime aide @entity16 was planning on releasing a memoir that told of their false paternity plot , @entity1 saw mr @entity6 again and turned the tables on mr @entity16			2
@entity1 said that mr @entity16 , who is now one of the lead witnesses for the prosecution , ' crossed a line '			2
' the money given by 101 - heiress ms @entity33 is at the heart of the @entity1 corruption trial , as it has to be determined whether or not the former senator himself knew that the money was used for his campaign or whether it was understood to be a ‘ gift ’ that could be put towards the cover - up of his pregnant mistress			1
if found guilty of breaking campaign finance laws , @entity1 faces up to 30 years in prison			2
two of monday ’s witnesses focused their testimony on the heiress ’ funds , and one is thought to have given a slight advantage to @entity1 ’ defense by saying she viewed her payments as gifts from one friend to another rather than political contributions			1
' i think her primary interest was in @entity1 as a person , ’ ms @entity33 ’s money manager @entity64 told the court			1
‘ she in her later years has had few close friends			0
her husband had died , her daughter was ill. she took a liking to @entity73			0
whatever was of interest to him , she would support			0
’ benefactor : @entity76 and @entity33 seen circa 1987			0
bunny is now blind and a recluse ' good morning for the home team ' : @entity1 thought that the testimony put forth by mellon - friend @entity82 was good for his case , saying @entity33 gave the money as a friend and not as a political contributor tallying up her donations is the complicated crux of the trial , as she gave $ 2,300 to the campaign - the amount legally allowed - along with $ 6.4million to political action committees and organizations related to @entity1 , and then a further $ 725,000 to former @entity1 aide @entity16			1
mr @entity64 testified that ms @entity33 was asked for the $ 725,000 by mr @entity16 , and she gave it even though he simply said it was for a ‘ personal need ’ of @entity1 ’ and did not specify further			2
it is now clear that personal need was the effort used to hide his mistress @entity15 and her ever - growing baby bump			2
@entity1 maintains that he did not know of mr @entity16 ’s requests , and that mr @entity16 pocketed much of the money to build a mansion for his family			1
‘ she felt very strongly for @entity1 , ’ mr @entity64 told the court , explaining that her intentions were personal and ‘ she was n’t interested in becoming secretary of state ’			0
in light of mr @entity64 ’s testimony , @entity1 was overheard whispering ‘ it was a good morning for the home team ’ to his 30 - year - old daughter @entity29 , who has been present throughout the trial			1
the tougher moment for @entity1 ’ team today , however , came when ms @entity33 ’s librarian @entity120 , who works in the heiress ’ botanical library , began speaking about the letter he helped her draft when she decided to decline the former @entity126 ’s request for $ 3million to help start the next phase of his life in 2011			1
confidant : @entity130 ( right ) , an interior decorator , told the court about how ms @entity33 ' thought @entity1 should pay for his girlfriend himself '			0
@entity1 ' mistress @entity15 ( seen with their daughter @entity136 in 2009 ) has been a frequent topic of the trial though the heiress got mr @entity120 to help her draft the letter , her lawyers later stopped her from sending it because , at the time , it was well - documented that @entity1 was the subject of a grand jury investigation			1
@entity1 ’ lawyers pushed - and were successful in their bid - to have this evidence removed from the trial , arguing that it would taint the juror ’s impression of the man			2
they said that the $ 725,000 given by ms @entity33 during the actual campaign is the money in question , and not later amounts			0
other personal friends of ms @entity33 have spoken at the trial , including the most entertaining testimony of interior designer @entity130			0
family support : @entity1 ( right ) has been accompanied to court by his daughter @entity29 ( center ) , his father @entity165 ( foreground ) and mother @entity163 ( not pictured ) appearing in the @entity28 court last week , mr @entity130 said that ms @entity33 was not necesarily upset about the fact that @entity1 had a pregnant mistress			1
instead she was more bothered that it was her money being used to pay for it			0
' she thought maybe you should probably pay for your girlfriend yourself , ' he said in court , prompting an outburst of laughter - even from @entity1 himself			0
mr @entity130 was involved in the case directly , as he helped write the checks that totalled $ 725,000 and helped cover their tracks by calling them part of a fledgling ( faux ) furniture business			0
the monetary requests and transfers between the @entity1 camp and ms @entity33 have been occupying much of the trial , and one previous session revealed that the elderly heiress was ' apoplectic ' when asked to donate $ 50million for a @entity1 - intiated poverty foundation at one point			1
