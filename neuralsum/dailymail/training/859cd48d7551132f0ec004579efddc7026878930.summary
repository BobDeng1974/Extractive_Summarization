by @entity0 published : 04:00 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 15:10 est , 8 march 2013 at just 200 pages long , this thin book about @entity3 artist @entity2 should have been a quick read			0
but it took @entity7 more than half a century to return the copy after borrowing it from an @entity11 library as a schoolboy in 1962			1
having missed the return date by a staggering 51 years , the now 60 - year - old could have been charged almost £ 3,000 in late fees , but bosses at the @entity17 waived the fine as part of an amnesty on overdue books			1
lapsed library user : @entity7 with the copy of @entity2 he borrowed from @entity11 's @entity17 more than half a century ago the copy of dr @entity26 ' profile of the 18th century artist was overdue by 18,417 days when arts writer mr @entity7 sheepishly brought it back to the library , after spotting a notice about the week - long amnesty			1
under @entity34 's late fee charge of 15 pence per day , mr @entity7 's fine would have amounted to £ 2762.55			2
mr @entity7 borrowed the book using a ticket belonging to his mother @entity37 when he was 12 ' when i read about the fines amnesty i decided that i must do it , once and for all , if only to see the librarian 's face , ' said mr @entity7			1
' it feels good to have finally returned it after all these years			0
' mr @entity7 borrowed the book using his mother and former town councillor @entity48 's ticket			1
' i was only a schoolboy at the time and completely forgot to return it , ' he said			0
' it would pop up every now and again over the years but each time it would slip my mind to actually do it			0
' two years ago i even attended a showing of the play underneath the @entity55 which is about a librarian who sets out to find whoever anonymously returned a library book that is 113 years overdue , ' mr @entity7 said			2
the amnesty has seen over 4,000 overdue books returned to @entity11 libraries			1
' i 've been a keen library user all my life , they are a great resource , ' said mr @entity7			2
' as a boy i drew great inspiration from this book which features a host of @entity2 's illustrations ; although i never intended to keep it for so long			0
i 'm glad they finally have their book back - i can now sleep a little more soundly at night			0
' late : the book about @entity3 artist @entity2 , left , was due to be returned to the library in september 1962 , right at last : library bosses waived the late fees on the book - which would have amounted to almost £ 3,000 councillor @entity79 , @entity11 's culture and sport convener , said : ' this is a wonderful story and , of course , the @entity17 are very happy to have their book back after 50 years			1
' despite the lengthy delay , the copy of @entity2 is not the most overdue book to be returned to a library			0
