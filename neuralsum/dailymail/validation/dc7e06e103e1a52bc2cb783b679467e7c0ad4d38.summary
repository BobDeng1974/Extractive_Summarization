for some , just the idea of tracking steps and calories is enough to make them exercise - but many of us need much more of an incentive			0
so designers in @entity8 have created a concept app that rewards you for working out by turning your heart rate data into virtual currency			1
the @entity14 technology syncs with fitness trackers to monitor how much energy is being used and this energy is converted into @entity18			1
it was created by @entity23 , a technology studio in @entity8 , @entity24 and the designers recently demonstrated the app at this year 's @entity27 festival it was created by @entity23 , a technology studio in @entity8 , @entity24 and the designers recently demonstrated the app at this year 's @entity27			1
' this concept combines two of our specialties : looking good and making money , ' said @entity23 boss , @entity35			1
' we 're always trying to turn existing habits into new opportunities to make money - this one was an obvious fit			0
' a @entity18 is a piece of data locked in an internet - based network by a complex equation computers can break			1
each @entity18 is a piece of code that has been generated through computer processing , known as ' mining '			2
once released it can be traded and used online and can be bought with cash			0
@entity18 operates as a two - way currency which can be exchanged for dollars , and vice versa			1
the finite nature of @entity18 means it performs more like a commodity , such as gold			2
@entity18 first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009			0
it was created by a hacker whose identity is a mystery , but is known as @entity58			0
this is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it			0
users choose a virtual wallet which enables them to receive , give and trade coins from other users			0
the app only works with fitness trackers that monitor heart rate and have open source software , which includes the @entity72 and @entity73 as the wearer exercises , the fitness tracker sends the heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used			1
an algorithm then converts this energy into ' computer processing time on a @entity18 mining rig ' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins			1

in particular , each @entity18 is a piece of computer code that has been generated through computer processing , also known as ' mining '			2
during the demonstration , designer @entity95 wore a @entity98 band and ran on a treadmill for three minutes and 40 seconds			0
his heart rate raised to 115 beats per minute and this mined around five cents			1
although this is a low amount , the technology is a concept so needs some refinement			0
plus the more energy a user expends , the more money they make			1

once released it can be traded and used online and can be bought with cash users can choose a virtual wallet to receive the money and can then trade coins with other users or with retailers who accept them , such as @entity137 and @entity138			0
@entity14 gives users real - time notifications and earnings updates as well as a dashboard to track how both their body and their bank account are progressing			0
@entity23 is also hoping that the technology could lower health insurance rates			2
for example , monthly rates could drop based on the amount of activity the user does			2
or sportswear firms could offer discounts when bought using virtual currency earned through the app. users can choose a virtual wallet to receive the money and can then trade coins with other users or with retailers who accept them , such as @entity137 and @entity138			0

concept technology was created by @entity8 - based @entity23
it syncs with fitness trackers , such as the @entity72 , to monitor heart rate
app tracks length of activity to determine how much energy is being used
algorithm then converts this energy into ' *cpu* time on a @entity18 mining rig '
during a demo the designers earned five cents for four minutes activity
and the more energy a user expends , the more *digital* currency they mine
