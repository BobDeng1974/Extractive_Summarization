@entity12 said it would not be ‘ helpful ’ to let the public know what to expect when border controls are lifted in less than 11 months			2
it is feared the wall of secrecy will leave town halls , schools and hospitals unable to prepare properly			1
long wait : the visa queue at the @entity25 embassy in @entity26 , @entity5 as the immigration minister snubbed questions on how many @entity4 and @entity5 were expected to flood the country , saying he did not want to scare people @entity33 mps said it was ‘ madness ’ to throw open the @entity25 ’s borders without giving voters an idea of what to expect			1
the government has carried out a study on how many of the 29million citizens of @entity4 and @entity5 might move to the @entity25 when they get full @entity43 rights in january			1
communities secretary @entity44 – who has seen the figures , and has warned of a potential shortage of housing – previously indicated they would be made available for public debate			2
but , amid heated exchanges in the @entity51 yesterday , mr @entity12 refused to share what the government knows			2
he was asked repeatedly either to release the data or to explain what the government was doing to deter a new wave of migration from @entity59			2
migrants from @entity4 and @entity5 will receive only the minimum level of benefits when they arrive in the @entity25 , the government has said mr @entity12 replied that he was chairing a @entity65 committee to look at how to stop migrants abusing the benefits system			1
ideas include trying to make it harder for newcomers to access benefits or ask them to carry residence cards			0
he told @entity32 : ‘ speculative projections about future inflows can not be made with any degree of accuracy and are therefore not particularly helpful			1
that ’s why the government is focused on dealing with the abuse of free movement rights and also reducing the pull factors for migration			0
we want to make sure that when people look at the access to our benefits and our public services that no one thinks we are a soft touch in this country			0
’ concern : immigration minister @entity12 , left , says that the government will ensure that the @entity25 is no ' soft touch ' when it comes to @entity5 and @entity4 immigrants , but @entity95 mp @entity94 , right , says the government is ' confused ' over the matter an estimate by the @entity100 think - tank has suggested the number of arrivals will average 50,000 a year for the first five years – the equivalent of a city the size of @entity106 or @entity107			1
tensions are rising among @entity33 mps who want the government to take firm action			1
they fear @entity114 ’s promise to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ will be fatally undermined if large numbers arrive from @entity4 and @entity5 , two of the poorest countries in the @entity43			0
currently , they are subject to transitional controls which limit the number of work permits available to low - skilled workers to around 20,000 a year			0
but , from the start of 2014 , these arrangements will be abandoned , giving workers free access to the @entity25 jobs market			1
speaking at @entity130 , @entity33 @entity129 said his constituents believed it was ‘ madness to open our borders to 29million people ’			1
he called for ministers to force @entity43 nationals who wanted to live in the @entity25 for more than three months to apply for a residency card			1
immigration ministers are examining the @entity25 's current welfare rules in a debate in the @entity141 his colleague @entity142 said action must be taken to curb ‘ welfare tourism that can only add to @entity25 public spending ’			1
another @entity33 , @entity146 , asked mr @entity12 specifically to comment on the @entity100 estimate of 50,000 a year			2
but mr @entity12 repeatedly refused to provide any indication of numbers			0
he said : ‘ we want to make sure that we offer what we need to under the treaties , but no more			0
’ ministers say they do not want to create ‘ scare ’ stories – which some @entity32 have taken to mean the figure is high			2
however , an alternative scenario is that the number produced by officials is low , and would make the government a hostage to fortune			0
@entity95 has never recovered from saying a mere 13,000 people would come from @entity164 in 2004 , only for hundreds of thousands of workers to arrive			0
last night there were new demands to publish the figures			0
sir @entity169 , chairman of @entity100 , said : ‘ there is surely a need for an intelligent estimate			0
the worst option , surely , is just to muddle on			0
