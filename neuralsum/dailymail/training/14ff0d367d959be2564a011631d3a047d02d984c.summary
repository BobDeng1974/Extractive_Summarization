a bug in the processor that powers the popular @entity4 tablet could be leaving private data at risk			1
investigations carried out by security researchers and the @entity9 discovered that they could retrieve ‘ deleted ’ data from second - hand models of the device			1
experts typically advise carrying out a factory reset to remove data from any gadget , but the investigation has revealed this technique may not always work on the supermarket ’s tablet			1
investigations carried out security researchers and the @entity9 discovered that they could retrieve ‘ deleted ’ data from second - hand models of @entity4 's @entity4 tablet ( pictured )			1
using free software , a security expert obtained unlock codes , @entity27 and site passwords , and browsing history the investigations involved second - hand gadgets bought on auction sites , including @entity33 , and included 10 @entity34			1
earlier this year , researchers from @entity36 found they were able to pull tens of thousands of photos , emails , text messages and more from used phones being on @entity33 that previous owners had thought they had ' wiped ' clean			2
aside from 40,000 photos and 250 ‘ compromising ’ selfies of men , the company was even able to discover the identity of several sellers , and one person ’s completed loan application			0
only one phone had third - party security software installed , and it actually gave up the most personal information of all			0
in response to the findings , @entity55 said : ' this research looks to be based on old devices and versions ( pre-android 3.0 ) and does not reflect the security protections in @entity63 versions that are used by the vast majority of users			0
' if you sell or dispose of your device , we recommend you enable encryption on your device and apply a factory reset beforehand ; this has been available on @entity63 for over three years			2
' the @entity9 , with help from @entity74 , security expert at @entity75 , said the @entity76 was vulnerable because of a bug in its @entity80 processor ’s firmware			1
using free software , mr @entity74 discovered that the flaw in the firmware meant he could read data stored on it , as well as write to it			1
he uncovered data including unlock codes , @entity27 and site passwords and browsing history			0
@entity4 said that devices returned to the stores have personal data wiped , and advised customers to use data wiping software , as well as carrying out a factory reset , to make sure the information is removed			1
@entity100 , vice president of global marketing and client solutions at computer firm @entity103 told @entity104 : ‘ to say it 's worrying to find tablet devices are being sold with data still on them is an understatement			0
‘ this is not the first instance , we ’re constantly seeing this kind of story in the news			0
‘ it ’s not good enough to delete the personal data to only a ‘ basic standard ’ or worse still , not at all as there is an obligation to comply with data protection laws			0
