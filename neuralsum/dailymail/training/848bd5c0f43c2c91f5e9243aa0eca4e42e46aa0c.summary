by @entity0 ever wondered what would happen to your body if you suddenly died in remote @entity5 bush ? a video posted on @entity7 unravels some of the mystery by substituting a cow carcass for a human 's body and using time - lapse photography to show a range of animals ravaging the body			1
taken over six weeks in @entity17 bush area , near @entity18 in northern @entity19 , the four - minute video titled if you died in the @entity5 @entity22 shows the various stages of the cow 's decay aided by a raft of animals feasting on it			1
' if it 's a cow , horse , possum , goat , if it 's a human - it 's all the same , ' said @entity34 , 49 , who took and posted the video			1
when one of his cows died of cancer , he used the body to primarily attract dingoes to nearby buried bait because they had been killing cows and pet dogs			2
' instead of wasting it , i utilised her ( the cow ) to do something good , ' he said			2
but in order to see what other animals were living in the bush , he used a time - lapse camera to see what was out there			1
' it was to see what 's been coming around			0
if you walk around the bush you see prints but you just do n't see them ( the animals ) , ' he said			2
foxes also enjoyed eating the what was left of the cow 's flesh throughout the six weeks active during the night , the foxes returned on multiple occasions to consume what was left with the cow 's body left in bush scrub near a large tree on june 25 , as expected , the first curious animal to inspect the remains was a dingo three days later			1
the video shows brief night time footage of the dog eating parts of the animal and the following night another dingo is again seen going repeatedly to and from the cow as it takes bites while feasting throughout the night			1
@entity100 are carnivorous , often eating rabbits , rats , kangaroos and wallabies			0
mr @entity34 said he does not believe it was the same dingo returning to the cow over multiple nights			0
but as the nights progressed and more dingoes came , other animals started investigating the rotting body during both day and night			2
to the right of a frame , a native bush rat can be seen rummaging by july the cow was showing visible signs of decomposition , but this was not enough to stop more animals from getting their fair share of what was left			1
the next to be drawn to the remains was an opportunistic fox on july 17 , captured at night			0
but the fox was not alone as it inspected the body and then devoured the carcass			0
the introduced pest was joined by a bush rat on the same night , which rummaged on the rotting body			0
but on august 1 , one of the more unusual animals to forage the cow corpse was a large goanna , which normally eats small lizards , mammals and insects			2
checking out the remains over two days , the goanna even walked over what was left of the body during day light			0
a goanna , which can eat meat , was another of the animals to feed on the cow remains the large lizard spent two days at cow carcass which was little more than skin and bones with the cow severely decayed , most of what was left appeared to be black and white hide and bones by the end of july yet one of the biggest surprises was an echidna spotted by the camera at night			1
living on the farm his whole life , mr @entity34 said it was a shock			0
' @entity164 , i 've seen them , but and echidna , i have n't seen one around since i was a kid			0
it 's nice to see , ' he said			0
' you do n't get to see them any more			0
' ' it just stopped , sniffed the cow 's leg and kept going			1
' a qualified wildlife ranger , mr @entity34 said it was encouraging to see native animals were still in the area despite the threat of dingoes and introduces pests such as foxes			2
an animal mr @entity34 did not expect to see was an echidna , which he said sniffed the cow 's leg before walking off			1

a video of dead cow in northern @entity19 bush shows animals feasting on it
the animals include dingoes , foxes , bust rats and a goanna
an echidna was also spotted sniffing the cow 's leg before walking off
time - lapse photography was used to capture the photos over six weeks
