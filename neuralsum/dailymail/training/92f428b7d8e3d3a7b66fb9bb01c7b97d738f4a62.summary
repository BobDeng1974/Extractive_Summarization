mr @entity0 , who had a privileged education at @entity7 , has reportedly visited several state schools in the capital in his quest to find a suitable secondary school place for 10 - year - old @entity12			1
the prime minister is understood to have visited @entity14 , an all - girls comprehensive three - quarters of a mile from @entity16 , according to the @entity17			1

mr @entity0 and his wife also visited @entity24 – one of the first comprehensives in the @entity27 – earlier this week , according to the @entity28			1
the school is usually more associated with @entity31 grandees such as the late @entity32 and also has up to six former pupils who have either left @entity27 to become @entity35 jihadists in the @entity36 or were linked to @entity35 terrorism			1
despite being in two of the wealthiest boroughs in the capital , both schools are described as ' ethnically diverse ' and have intakes from some of @entity45 's most deprived areas			0
the @entity49 school - the local secondary school to @entity47 - has two - thirds of pupils from ' a wide range of minority ethnic backgrounds '			2
@entity12 and @entity53 attended the same primary school in @entity55 , central @entity45 and it is thought mr @entity0 has been discussing his decision with mr @entity18			1
mrs @entity57 - who was educated at @entity58 - has also reportedly told friends she is keen for @entity12 to have a ' normal education '			2
a friend told the paper : ' her children 's lives are abnormal enough			2
being in a state school is a nice antidote to that			1
' you get to meet normal children from normal houses whose fathers do n't go off and spend the weekend with @entity72			0
@entity90 's intake is described as ' diverse with two thirds of students from a wide range of minority ethnic groups , of which the largest are groups with @entity96 or black caribbean heritage '			0
it adds that ' one third of students speak a first language other than @entity102 but very few are at an early stage of learning @entity102			0
' the 12 - page admissions criteria describes how each of the 151 place for year 7 students is decided upon			0
according to the criteria , 15 of the 151 places will be awarded to girls with an aptitude for languages ; 80 to practising @entity49 families and 28 to ' churches together ' faiths			0
governors allocate 25 per cent of the places to girls of above - average ability , 50 per cent to those of average ability and 25 per cent to students of below - average ability			2
mr and mrs @entity57 are also considering @entity126 , one of the first comprehensives in the @entity27 , which has up to six former who have left @entity27 to became @entity35 jihadists in the @entity36 or were linked to @entity35 terrorism the remaining 28 places will go to children with siblings at the school , and girls living in the surrounding parishes			1
but the school has been criticised in the past for being an ' elite ' state school			1
after mr @entity18 announced his daughter would become a pupil there , research by the @entity146 found 14 per cent of children are eligible for free school meals , compared with an average of 33 per cent locally			1
it also claimed it was in the ' top 1 per cent of the least socio - economically inclusive secondary schools in @entity49 '			0
@entity18 ’s daughter @entity22 won a place at @entity153 earlier this year , making him the first conservative education secretary to send his child to a state secondary			1
@entity157 , the chancellor , removed his children from a state primary to send them to a private prep school			1
@entity161 , the universities and science minister , also caused controversy when opted for private schools @entity166 and @entity167 and @entity168 ’s			0
when @entity169 was prime minister , he attracted controversy by sending his children to the @entity171			0
critics said it selected by parental interview , which favoured the professional middle classes			0
in addition , he and his wife , @entity176 , used teachers from the independent @entity180 school to give his sons @entity183 and @entity184 extra tuition			2
the prime minister has constantly had to battle sceptics who feel his education at @entity7 makes him ill - equipped to represent ordinary voters			2
and mrs @entity57 is the daughter of sir @entity189 – a landowner descended from @entity191 she attended the fee - paying @entity58 in @entity192 , where the @entity193 was also educated			2
but her time studying fine arts at the @entity196 in @entity197 apparently convinced mrs @entity57 that her children would benefit from exposure to people of different backgrounds			0
the move would see mr @entity0 become the first @entity204 prime minister to send his child to a state school while in @entity16			1
other options are thought to include @entity208 in central @entity45 and @entity209 in @entity210 , west @entity45			0
mr @entity0 has now visited @entity24 in @entity55 - dubbed the ' @entity211 ' - twice , including at an open day this week			1
the school counts @entity214 actress @entity213 and mr @entity32 ’s children among its alumni			2
with a catchment area including some of the wealthiest homes in the capital , around 60 per cent of pupils at @entity126 come from ‘ a wide range of ethnic backgrounds ’ , according to @entity86 , and speak @entity102 as a second language			2
six former pupils of the school have travelled to @entity227 , three of whom have been killed in fighting			0
one appeared on a video in the summer appealing for more recruits from the @entity27 to join @entity233 ’s ‘ golden era of jihad ’ ; one woman was found guilty in august of fundraising for terrorism and her female co-defendant , who was in the same year as her at @entity126 , was cleared of the same offence			0
mr @entity0 has spoken openly in the past about his plans to send his children to state schools , during a question and answer session at the @entity245 in @entity197 in november 2012 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ i would like my children to go to state schools , that ’s my intention , and i think what ’s happening in the state school system is really exciting			1
‘ what we ’re seeing is something we should have seen years ago which is the flowering of more choice , more competition , more diversity and crucially higher standards			0
i want my children to be part of that and i ’m very heartened by what is happening			0
’ a @entity47 spokesman said : ' as with other parents at this time of year , the prime minister and mrs @entity57 are looking at various schools for their daughter to go to next september			0
