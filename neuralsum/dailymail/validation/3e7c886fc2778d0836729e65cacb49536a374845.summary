in - flight meals can be unappetising at the best of times so it ’s always a good idea to bring along some snacks if you are going to be in the air for a while			0
the problem is , when you ’re confined to a little seat on a fighter jet hurtling through the clouds at the speed of sound and the pilot is holding a chocolate bar , just how can you get your hands on it ? well a pilot and his navigator found the perfect way without having to take their eyes off the sky , and captured the moment on camera			2
the pilots appear to be part of the @entity28 , judging by their helmets , but little is known about the origin of the video			1
the pilot lets go of the chocolate bar to allow the gravitational pull to transport it to his navigator holding a @entity35 chocolate bar in his hand , the pilot lets go and allows the gravitational force to do the rest			1
waiting with an outstretched arm , as the chocolate bar floats behind the pilot , the navigator reaches out and after a little bit of scrabbling manages to catch it in his hands			2
throwing it back up in the air before catching it again the navigator waves the bar around in celebration and the pilot gives him the thumbs up in approval			1
floating in the air , the chocolate begins its journey towards the navigator who waits with an outstretched hand on its way : the navigator scrambles for the chocolate bar as it floats towards him and manages to catch it the fact that it was uploaded to an empty @entity63 account however has brought about speculation that the video is a commercial for @entity35			1
but it may just be a way for the two pilots to keep their identity a mystery while having some fun			0
@entity73 like this occurs when there are no external objects touching the chocolate bar and exerting a push or pull upon it			0
when in a state of free fall like the pilots , the only force acting upon the snack is gravity – a non-contact force			0
and since gravity can not be felt without any other opposing forces , there is no sensation of it present			0
success : after catching the chocolate bar the navigator celebrates and the pilot gives him the thumbs up			2

the @entity35 bar is released by the pilot and floats behind him
scrabbling in the air the navigator catches it in his hand
pilot gives him the thumbs up as a seal of approval
*believed* to be @entity28 pilots judging by their helmets
