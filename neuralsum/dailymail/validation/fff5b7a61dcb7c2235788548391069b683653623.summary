@entity0 was last night claiming victory in the battle over the election tv debates after @entity4 was forced to line up with the minnow parties on a ‘ night of the non-entities ’			1
@entity7 reacted with fury when the broadcasters announced – after weeks of wrangling – that neither @entity11 nor @entity12 would be invited to the second debate on april 16			1
only the non-governing parties will feature , meaning mr @entity4 will appear with the leaders of @entity16 , the @entity17 , the @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity11 will only appear in one full debate , hosted by @entity21 on thursday , april 2 , with the six other party leaders @entity4 will have to line up with the minnow parties on a ‘ night of the non-entities ’ because neither @entity11 nor @entity12 will be invited to the second debate on april 16 mr @entity12 ’s absence means that mr @entity4 will not be able to accuse mr @entity11 of being ‘ chicken ’ by avoiding the exchange , or force the broadcasters to ‘ empty chair ’ the prime minister			1
@entity32 has also successfully killed the idea of a direct head - to - head debate between mr @entity11 and mr @entity4			1
the two men will instead join mr @entity12 in making individual appearances in front of a studio audience for a @entity39 question time special			0
it means that mr @entity11 will only appear in one full debate , hosted by @entity21 on thursday , april 2 , with the six other party leaders			1
the announcement of the broadcasters ’ final plans represents a triumph for @entity0 strategists , who did not want the election campaign to be dominated by the debates , as it was in 2010 , on the grounds that mr @entity4 ’s stock is already so low with the public he had the least to lose			2
but the @entity53 have described the final arrangements as a ‘ farce ’			0
and @entity7 issued an angry statement accusing the broadcasters of reneging on a commitment to proceed with the head - to - head debate programme after ‘ weeks of pressure from the @entity61 ’ , insisting that the ‘ cowardice ’ of mr @entity11 had thwarted the head - to - head encounter			1
@entity7 also claimed that mr @entity12 had been excluded from the april 16 debate ‘ at the @entity61 ’s insistence ’ to provide cover for the pm ’s absence			2
@entity7 has claimed that @entity12 ( pictured ) had been excluded from the april 16 debate ‘ at the @entity61 ’s insistence ’ to provide cover for the @entity68 ’s absence @entity16 leader @entity69 areacted angrily , saying tv debates were now ' so far from the original proposals ' a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ the whole country will understand the reasons for this : the prime minister wants to minimise the scope of televised debates between himself and @entity4			1
‘ we hope that even at this late stage @entity11 will rethink his decision not to take part on april 16			2
‘ the prime minister ’s repeated attempts to dictate the abandonment of these tv programmes to independent broadcasters is deeply worrying			0
’ the spokesman added that after the @entity7 would seek to put future debate programmes on a statutory footing			0
@entity16 leader @entity69 also reacted angrily , saying : ‘ tv debates are now so far from the original proposals			2
they ’ve kow - towed to manipulation from @entity0			0
’ in a joint statement , the @entity39 , @entity21 , @entity95 and @entity96 said : ‘ we ’re delighted there will be a debate with all the party leaders during the campaign			1
the debate on april 2 will build on the success of the 2010 tv debates so valued by viewers			0
’ a @entity53 spokesman said : ‘ if it was down to us , we would be in every tv debate			0
but the politicians and broadcasters have ducked and dived on this long enough and need to get on with it			0
frankly this is all a farce ’			0
a @entity32 spokesman said : ‘ we have agreed to the broadcasters ’ proposal			0
