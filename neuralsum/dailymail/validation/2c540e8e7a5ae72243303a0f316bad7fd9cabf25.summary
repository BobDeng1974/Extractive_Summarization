workers at the @entity3 government 's @entity1 have been asked to use online tests to check whether they are secretly racist , or harboring other biases			1
the federal employees were asked to use work time to take tests , lasting some 15 minutes each , to see whether they have unconscious biases based on sexuality , nationalist , race and whether somebody is disabled			2
the practice was reported on by the @entity16 , which said the directive to take the @entity19 quizzes came from @entity21 director @entity20			1
test : employees were asked to take assessments such as the above on race , where users alternate between sorting black and white people , then good and bad qualities			0
the speed with which they do it determined underlying bias , according to the study he also reportedly asked bosses at other federal agencies to spread links to the @entity19 tests , hosted at implicit.harvard.edu			1
idea : @entity20 , pictured , sent the tests round to staff the tests are a kind of word association game , which flashes up emotions or qualities such as ' happy ' , ' agony ' and ' laughter ' , which users must sort into ' good ' and ' bad ' categories			1
these are then mixed with elements of the category being tested - for example the race test flashes up pictures of black and white faces			0
participants complete several rounds of testing , first being instructed to associate all the ' good ' words with one race , then the other			0
the more quickly and accurately they make each association - good or bad - the stronger their underlying bias is said to be			0
@entity20 asked his workers to take two tests each , and said they would be discussed in a later meeting			2
an unnamed congressional source suggested to the @entity16 that the tests are a waste of time , and the agency should focus on stopping forest fires			2
defending himself , @entity20 said : ' the unconscious bias material can help us explore diversity and inclusion in the workplace			0
' it was included in a discussion of diversity as part of a continuous series of collaborative discussions on a variety of topics we have on my staff that cover key @entity1 policies and values as a means of fostering continued awareness			0
' federal agency : @entity20 urged leaders of departments other than his slice of the @entity1 to start using the tests			1

top manager of government service told workers to take @entity19 tests
word association exercise *judges* what people 's biases could be
@entity20 , a director in federal agency , defended the practice
