the @entity0 had young children preparing for nuclear war with duck - and - cover practice drills in classrooms across the country and politicians fearing a call from the dreading a call from the red phone prompting the use of launch codes			0
now a graphic artist in @entity13 imagined what it would look like if nuclear explosions were a part of today ’s everyday landscape			1
@entity19 created a series of composite images that juxtaposed pictures of explosions next to inquisitive tourists who , in keeping with today ’s culture of participation and constant sharing , would want to see the incidents for themselves			1
a different seascape : @entity13 - based artist @entity19 created graphic designs that put pictures of tourists next to nuclear explosions as a statement on our voyeuristic society @entity36 : the artist theorized what it would look like if there were nuclear explosions happened frequently today not a sunset : he said that he predicts that people would stand a safe distance away but still watch ‘ this series recontextualizes a legacy of atomic tests in order to keep the reality of our post-atomic era fresh and omnipresent , ’ mr @entity19 wrote in an explanation about the series			1

mr @entity19 warned that it was the voyeuristic nature of this generation which prompted his series , and he fears that if we were to face a world with more frequent nuclear explosions , his created images may happen in real life			1
‘ i can only hope that mankind will never again suffer the wrath of such a destructive force , but it is clear that the world would not hesitate to watch , ’ he said .			0
