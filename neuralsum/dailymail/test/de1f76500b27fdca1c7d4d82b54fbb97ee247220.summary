@entity15 , 46 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , was working on his book of portraits , just breathe : adults with @entity2 , when he realized that he had far more female subjects than male			1

' i know what these woman go through on a daily basis ; everyday it 's a struggle living with @entity2 and , to the uninformed , it is the invisible fatal disease , ' he wrote on his website of the upcoming book , which is ' dedicated to showing how beautiful those fighting @entity2 truly are '			1
mr @entity15 explained that at the time he had seen in the news a model with @entity75 posing in a bikini with her colostomy bag , as well as @entity79 interviewing a model with vitiligo , a disease that causes the causes the loss of skin color			2
' i just thought well , it 's time for a model with @entity2 , ' he said			2
the project 's name , @entity29 , is derived from the fact that people with @entity2 have more salt in their sweat compared with those who do not have the disorder			1
life of the party : this model posed in her lace bra while holding a @entity102 beer bottle for her portrait still smiling : another woman with @entity2 wore a green two - piece to show off her chest tube ' these women are inspirational and fearless , and we want to show hope for those younger @entity110 , ' mr @entity15 noted of the women , who are roughly between the ages of 20 and 40			1
one of the models with @entity2 , who chose to remain anonymous , revealed on mr @entity15 's website that the disease has led to her having ' countless body image issues '			1
' it took a huge amount of courage for me to be able to expose my body for @entity29 , ' she explained			2
' when i look at my body , all i see are my scars			0
' she added : ' i pick out every single thing i find wrong with my body , and compare it with other women 's bodies			2

my body may be scarred due to all of the physical trauma i have had to endure with @entity2 , but , it will never define " me " as a person , ' she wrote			0
' it will define my experiences and how it has shaped my perspective on @entity164 , and everyone that is struggling [ sic ]			0
' she added : ' my scars tell a story of a triumph after every obstacle			0
my scars tell me that no matter the bs i 've had to deal with in my life - i still manage to keep the fire in my spirit burning			1
that is enough to keep me going [ sic ]			0
' mr @entity15 , who was n't diagnosed with @entity2 until he was 38 - years - old , is looking to bring hope to children and teens with the fatal disease			1

no fear : another model rolled up her muscle t - shirt to show off her scars , as well as her arm tattoos important message : this woman wore a tank top that reminds others that she is beautiful @entity197 - inspired : this @entity2 sufferer sported a furry hat and nothing else when she posed for mr @entity15 ' one of the goals of this project was for younger people with @entity2 to see the portraits and know there is future for them , ' @entity15 told @entity210			1
' yes , there are varying degrees and not all @entity110 are alike			0
but with the advances in treatment , proper nutrition and exercise , it is a far brighter future than even just 10 - 15 years ago			0
' according to the @entity221 , few children who suffered from the disease in the 1950s lived to attend elementary school , but now many people diagnosed with the condition can expect to live into their 30s , 40s or longer			0
