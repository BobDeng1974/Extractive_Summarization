a playful dog found himself in a rather tight spot after he got his head stuck in an air vent			1
eight - month - old border collie @entity5 was left with his head wedged through a wall after exploring his home in @entity10 , @entity11			1
worried owner @entity12 tried everything to free her pet - including covering him in washing - up liquid and dog shampoo in a bid to slide his neck out of the 3in gap			1
when @entity23 's head wouldnt budge , frantic @entity21 called in @entity25 officers - who in turn called out vets and fire crews in a multi-service operation to free him eight - month - old @entity5 was left with his head wedged through a wall after exploring his home in @entity10 , @entity11 worried owner @entity12 tried everything to free her pet but when @entity23 's head would n't budge , miss @entity12 called in @entity25 officers , who in turn called out vets and fire crews in a multi-service operation to free playful @entity23			1
the dog was eventually freed almost three hours after he went off exploring and found himself stuck			2
miss @entity12 said : ' i 'd let @entity5 out in the garden to play just before i went round to see my friend			2
' i called him , and thought it was strange when he did n't come straight away			2
we have only had him a few weeks , but he does n't really go far from my side			0
' i wandered a bit further down the garden and just saw his little head poking out of the wall			0
he was bright eyed , and was n't in any distress , and my first instinct was to laugh at him as he just looked so ridiculous			0
' however , when i realised he was stuck , and he could n't move his head out , i started to panic			2
i tried covering him in shampoo , in the hope we could slide his neck out , but nothing worked			0
' tight spot : firefighters rescuing @entity23 the dog after he got his head stuck in an air vent @entity25 inspector @entity63 said : ' this was certainly one of the more unusual rescues i have been called to attend ' after more than an hour of trying to free @entity23 , desperate @entity21 gave in and called an @entity25 helpline			1
but local inspectors were stumped as to how to rescue @entity23 - and called in local vets			1
miss @entity12 said : ' by this time , my little boy , @entity69 , eight , was really worried about @entity23 , and started crying			1
' then @entity5 started getting quite distressed , but the vets could n't get him out either - so it was time to call for the fire brigade			1
' all smiles now : the dog was eventually freed almost three hours after he went off exploring vet @entity77 sedated @entity23 to prevent him from injuring himself while fire crews cut away at the wall , creating a big enough gap for @entity23 to be lifted free			1
mr @entity77 said : ' @entity23 was getting distressed by his situation and was putting up a fight so he needed to be sedated to stop him injuring himself			0
' after he was sedated he was snoring ! his head was down and he was asleep which made it easier for the rescuers to work round him and i stayed to make sure he was stable			0
i can say this was one of the strangest cases i had been called out to deal with			0
' miss @entity12 added : ' @entity23 was checked over by the vet and was right as rain , and we 're just pleased he 's ok			1
' he was a bit wobbly on his feet for a few hours , but by the next day he was right as rain and you 'd never know anything had happened to him			0
' you 'd think he would have learned his lesson , but i do have to keep an eye on him - because his favourite place to go and play now is the hole in the wall left by the fire service ! ' crew manager at @entity109 , @entity110 said : ' we were called in from @entity10 and @entity112 because all other efforts to extricate the dog had failed and our specialist equipment was required			2
' we attend rescue incidents of this nature to make sure that people do not put themselves at risk by getting into dangerous situations or using inappropriate tools			0
i 'm glad to hear the dog is recovering well from its ordeal			0
' @entity25 inspector @entity63 said : ' this was certainly one of the more unusual rescues i have been called to attend			2
fortunately despite his ordeal @entity5 was fine and i just want to thank everyone who took part in the rescue			0
