@entity1 's first black prime minister will be a conservative , @entity3 will claim today			1
in a bid to woo ethnic minority voters , mr @entity3 will say the @entity6 are the party of opportunity for people from all backgrounds who want to get on			1
he will also set out targets for ethnic minority recruitment designed to persuade voters the party is on their side			1
the party of the first @entity26 prime minister			1
and i know that , one day , we ’re going to be the party of the first black or @entity19 prime minister			1
’ ‘ i want this to be an opportunity country , where no matter who you are or where you ’re from ; whether you ’re black , white , @entity19 or mixed race – whether you ’re from the inner city or rural heartlands , you can make the most of your talents			2
’ the claim will be seen as a tacit endorsement of the leadership ambitions of culture secretary @entity40 , the only current @entity19 @entity41 seen as a potential contender			2
it is designed to tackle the @entity6 ’ long - standing difficulty in attracting support from @entity1 ’s growing ethnic minority electorate			1
the claim will be seen as a tacit endorsement of the leadership ambitions of culture secretary @entity40 ( pictured ) , the only current @entity19 @entity41 seen as a potential contender a report by the @entity52 think - tank last week warned that suspicion of the @entity6 among ethnic minority voters could cost the party nine seats at next month ’s election and 50 within a decade			1
some senior @entity6 believe mr @entity3 has done too little to address the party ’s reputation among ethnic minority voters – and warn that the party could face similar problems to the @entity63 republicans unless it acts quickly			1
mr @entity3 will today pledge to ensure that , by the next election , at least 20 per cent of @entity41 candidates in seats where a @entity41 mp is standing down will be from an ethnic minority background			1
the figure this year is 18 per cent			0
at the time of the last census in 2011 , 14 per cent of the @entity1 population was identified as black or minority ethnic			2
but the prime minister will today set targets to achieve 20 per cent ethnic representation in the recruitment of police officers			1
the current figure is just 8.3 per cent			0
a 10 per cent target will also be set for the armed forces , to hit 20 per cent in the long term			2
at present the figure for recruits is 5.7 per cent			0
new targets will also be set to increase by 20 per cent the number of black and ethnic minority students going to university , being offered apprenticeships and getting jobs			1
mr @entity3 will say : ‘ our mission is to make sure that as our economy recovers , people from every community share in that prosperity			2
‘ but there are more specific things we can do to make sure we spread opportunity to every community			0
so i ’m setting some ambitious but realistic aspirations for the next five years , specifically for the black and minority ethnic communities			2
’ @entity104 has said @entity1 needs to train more crane drivers and it experts to stop migrants filling jobs			0
the mayor of @entity110 claimed the @entity1 has too many hairdressers and not enough young people learning to do the jobs the economy needs			0
he said the country ’s it industry desperately needs computer programmers , while building sites need crane operators – and both are often forced to depend on foreign labour			0
mr @entity104 said colleges had to work more closely with businesses to teach teenagers the skills they need to land well - paid jobs , which would help to reduce the reliance on migrants			0
he said he did not want to ‘ tell talented foreigners to bog off ’ , but to ensure young people growing up in the @entity1 were able to take the high - skilled jobs which have seen average wages start to rise			0
the mayor , who is the @entity41 candidate for @entity135 and @entity136 , told @entity137 : ‘ do we need more crane operators and fewer hairdressers ? i think the answer to that at the moment is yes			0
do we need more people who can do coding for it , the answer is absolutely yes			0
‘ we have a desperate shortage of those sorts of skills ... we have got to up - skill the @entity1 labour force			0
