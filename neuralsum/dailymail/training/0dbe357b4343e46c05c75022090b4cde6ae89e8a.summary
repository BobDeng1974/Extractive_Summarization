by @entity0 affair rumours swirl but were @entity2 and @entity3 doomed from the start , given they are a classic case of ' opposites attract ' ? he 's notoriously shy , lost his virginity at 22 and avoids the public eye			1
she has a fondness for first - night red carpets , a long list of lovers and @entity17 a-listers as best friends			2
@entity2 announced her separation from @entity3 today ' seek a mate whose values and background echo your own ' is standard relationship advice from people who know their stuff - like @entity27 love guru @entity26 , who 's been studying long - term couples for more than 25 years			1
@entity3 and @entity29 flew in the face of that advice and got married anyway			1
their ' conscious uncoupling ' means they 've proved the ' opposites attract but do n't last ' rule true , yet againâ € ¦ or has it ? not only are @entity3 and @entity2 managing a remarkably amicable separation , they clocked up a decade of marriage , which , quite frankly , is a lot more than most of us achieve			1
could it be opposites have a lot more in common than we think ? @entity46 very firmly plants its feet on the side of similiarity			2
@entity0 believes that parenting can keep a couple like @entity3 and @entity2 together , the pair are seen here with their daughter @entity56 shortly after her birth in 2004 studies repeatedly tell us the key to long - term happiness is choosing someone who is a lot like @entity63 your partner agrees with you on most things , those destructive , ' they 'd be perfect , if only ' thoughts are reduced			1
someone who validates your existing views and habits is far easier to live with than someone bent on trying to change you to theirs			2
it 's logical : marry someone with a similar family background , income level , aspirations , personality traits , religion and age and your chances of romantic success are bound to be higher			2
the more a couple share a similar perspective to life , the less conflict there 's going to be			2
compatibility questionnaires used in pre-marriage counselling - asking questions like ' how important is being faithful ? ' and ' how should you raise children ? ' - are highly successful in predicting what chance a couple have of surviving and how happy they 'll be with their relationships			1
@entity0 says ' opposites ' might not have the smoothest relationships , but the highs are likely to be higher but there 's one edge that opposites have over @entity105 couples : they have much better sex			1
relationships without conflict are easy and comforting			1
but if you get on so well , you never have differing views about anything , your marriage has a brother - sister dynamic			0
if you 're not quite sure of your partner and ca n't predict how they 'll think or react , the excitement level is higher			0
uneasiness might feel uncomfortable , but it keeps you on your toes			0
@entity122 likes to keep loved ones close - by , kept away from any threats like rival partners			0
lust thrives when our partners go out into the world without us because uncertainty and difference are what create a sexual spark			0
' @entity136 ' might not have the smoothest relationships , but the highs are likely to be higher , which suits some personality types			2
the trick to getting the balance just right , is ensuring your differences and similarities are in the right areas			0
you wanting to spend sundays curled up on the sofa with a book while he sets off on an eight - hour hike is a doable difference			0
one of you being deeply religious and the other an atheistâ € ¦ not so much			0
a high compatibility score on personal and moral values is way more important than interests and hobbies for obvious reasons			0
want the best of both worlds ? a perfect match would be someone who agrees with you on important stuff like sexual morals , parenting and how to show affection but is passionate about things you have n't thought to explore			0
perhaps this is the formula that kept @entity2 and @entity3 going for 10 years			1
and perhaps that 's not such a bad achievement			0
