after befriending her through his youth club , @entity2 seduced her when she was just 12 then had regular sexual liaisons with the girl - promising her marriage and even showing her holiday brochures of where he said they would go on their honeymoon			1

the girl was said to have been ' completely infatuated ' with @entity2 but their relationship fizzled out after the girl became pregnant at 15 and subsequently had an abortion after confiding to her mother			1

the court had heard @entity2 was in his late 20s , married with children and a leader at a youth club when he befriended the girl when she was 11 in 1988			1
but when they were alone together he started to stroke her hair , give her money and tell her how pretty she was			2
the girl was said to have enjoyed the attention and then subsequently had sex with @entity2 ' hundreds of times ' over the course of the next four years			1
prosecutor miss @entity75 said : ' he promised her the earth to abuse her over a number of years			1
' she allowed him to have sex with her to try and win his love because he told her that 's what people who loved each other did			2
' he would tell her things were difficult with his wife , who did n't want to do certain sexual acts with him			2
' he said he and the girl had a future , they were going to get married			2
he would show her holiday brochures of where they would go ' she listened to him and believed him and she thought he loved her			2
she loved him and was completely infatuated with him			2
' trial : @entity2 was found guilty of 21 counts of indecent assault and one count of gross indecency at @entity98 the girl 's mother found some notes she had written about @entity2 hidden on top of the wardrobe while she was cleaning - but she thought they were just the infatuated fantasies of a teenager and threw the notes away			1
the girl eventually confessed her affair with @entity2 to her mother when she became pregnant by him at 15			1
but the mother agreed to keep pregnancy secret as she feared the girl 's father would be so angry he would kill @entity2			1
she took her daughter to the doctor 's to have a termination instead			2
during the trial the mother said : ' i was thinking of her future			2
she was too young to have a baby			2
but she was terrible , right from having that termination			2
i used to hear her sobbing in the night			0
' i used to go and stroke her hair until she went to sleep			0
she was only a child			0
she just started to go downhill			0
she just gave up on everything , she was just so sad			0
she was so sad all the time			0
there was no spark there or anything			0
' the mother said from the age of 17 onwards her daughter was drinking , taking tablets and overdosing			0
she continued : ' it was just drinking and pills and having her stomach pumped			0
that went on for a few years			1
' she never , ever had boyfriends yet she was popular because she was lovely			0
but she would never go out with anybody			0
' when asked why she never confronted @entity2 about his relationship with her daughter she added : ' i have gone over this and thought " why did n't i go down ? " ' but what was the point ? he had a wife			1
he had three little children			0
i just wanted everything sorted and back to normal			0
that 's how i saw it at the time			0
it was just panic stations			0
' when the girl told @entity2 about the termination he did not appear bothered and was only interested in when sex could start again			1
the affair broke up shortly afterwards when she was 16			1
@entity2 who later broke up with his wife denied any affair saying it was a ' figment of her imagination '			1
he added : ' she may have been 12 when she started on a sexual adventure , but it was n't with me			1
' in mitigation , defence counsel @entity170 , said @entity2 had been with his current partner for 10 years and was ' dismayed ' at being convicted			1
the barrister added : ' this has completely ruined his life			0
he has lived all his life in the @entity54 area			0
' he 's well known there and was well respected			0
he involved himself in many local activities			0
all that , effectively , has now been put to an end			0
' sentencing , judge @entity182 told @entity2 : ' it an aggravating feature that you were a youth leader , and to some extent , exploited that position			1
' your conviction has been a shock to you			0
it 's been a shock to many other people who genuinely believed that you were a good man			0
in many other respects you were a good man and did good works for the community but it was a cover to what was going on of a sexual nature underneath			0
