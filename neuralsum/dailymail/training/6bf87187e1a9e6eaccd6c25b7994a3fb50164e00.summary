scientists have put together the first ever map of how the brain organises the thousands of images that come flooding in through our eyes every day			1
a team at the @entity7 , have found that the brain is wired to put in order all the categories of objects and actions that we see			1
to illustrate their findings , they have created the first map of how the brain organises these categories across the cortex			1
click here to open the interactive version of the map in a new window ( may take some time to load ) the team used @entity27 scans of patients to work out which how which regions of their brains process different categories of information ( right )			1
they were then able to show the regions on a virtual @entity36 ( left ) the result — achieved through computational models of brain imaging data collected while test subjects watched hours of video clips — is what researchers call ' a continuous semantic space '			1
the @entity7 team have mapped this data across the human cortex to show which areas of the brain deal with which categories of objects we see in the world around us			1
some relationships between categories make sense - for example , that humans and animals share the same ' semantic neighbourhood ' - while others - like the apparent link between hallways and buckets - seem less obvious			0
nevertheless , the researchers found that different people share a similar semantic layout			0
the @entity7 team used functional @entity69 ( @entity27 ) to record the brain activity of five researchers as they each watched two hours of film clips			1
researchers then analysed the readings to find correlations in data and build a model showing how each of 30,000 subdivisions in the cortex responded to the 1,700 categories of objects and actions shown			2
next , they used principal components analysis , a statistical method that can summarize large data sets , to find the ' semantic space ' that was common to all the study subjects			2
the results are presented in multicoloured , multi-dimensional maps showing the more than 1,700 visual categories and their relationships to one another			0
categories that activate the same brain areas have similar colours			2
for example , humans are green , animals are yellow , vehicles are pink and violet and buildings are blue			0
' our methods open a door that will quickly lead to a more complete and detailed understanding of how the brain is organised , ' said @entity108 , lead author of the study published yesterday in the journal @entity111			2
' already , our online brain viewer appears to provide the most detailed look ever at the visual function and organisation of a single human brain			2
' his and his colleagues findings show that the brain efficiently represents the diversity of categories in a compact space			1
instead of having a distinct brain area devoted to each category , as previous work had identified , for some but not all types of stimuli , the researchers found brain activity is organised by the relationship between categories			1
' humans can recognise thousands of categories			0
given the limited size of the human brain , it seems unreasonable to expect that every category is represented in a distinct brain area , ' said mr @entity108			2
a clearer understanding of how the brain organises visual input can help with the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders			2
the findings may also be used to create brain - machine interfaces , particularly for facial and other image recognition systems			1
' our discovery suggests that brain scans could soon be used to label an image that someone is seeing , and may also help teach computers how to better recognise images , ' said mr @entity108			0
@entity156 map of the brain : this images of subjects ' brains scanned as part of the study shows how which regions of their brains process different categories of information			1
see key below these three images are the key for the above brain scans : different categories are represented in four semantic dimensions by different colours			0
categories that activate the same brain areas have similar colours			0
for example , humans are green , animals are yellow , vehicles are pink and violet and buildings are blue he has produced a video and interactive website to explain the science of what the researchers found			1
it was long believed that each category of object or action humans see — people , animals , vehicles , household appliances and movements — is represented in a separate region of the visual cortex			0
but this new study shows that these categories are actually represented in highly organised , overlapping maps that cover as much as 20 per cent of the brain , including the somato - sensory and frontal cortices			0
' using the semantic space as a visualisation tool , we immediately saw that categories are represented in these incredibly intricate maps that cover much more of the brain than we expected , ' mr @entity108 said			0
dr @entity212 , at whose laboratory the work was carried out , said : ' discovering the feature space that the brain uses to represent information helps us to recover functional maps across the cortical surface			0
' the brain probably uses similar mechanisms to map other kinds of information across the cortical surface , so our approach should be widely applicable to other areas of cognitive neuroscience			0

@entity7 team use @entity27 to find out where semantically linked **concepts** are processed in the brain
findings are a *quantum* leap from previous research mapping **concepts** to brain regions
team create video and interactive website to present their incredible discoveries
