@entity0 of the @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , said that mankind could turn to geoengineering to solve our problems with the environment - but it could have side - effects the sky could turn from a reassuring blue to a blank white if scientists are forced to take drastic action to tackle global warming , experts have claimed			1
by injecting aerosols which scatter light into the atmosphere we could reflect more sun away from @entity22 and cool the planet			1
but the knock - on effect would be the scattering of red particles around the atmosphere that wash out the blue			1
the result would be skies that turn into a foggy or hazy white instead of the crisp colours we are used to on a summer ’s day			2
according to report in the @entity33 , such a measure would cut by a fifth the amount of sunlight that makes its way to @entity22 , though the reduction in the amount of blue in the sky could be much more pronounced			1
@entity0 of the @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , said that mankind could turn to geoengineering to solve our problems with the environment , a drastic solution once things have taken a turn for the worse			0
he said that particles ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 micrometers in diameter would need to be scattered in order to influence the amount of light in the sky			1
if only particles in the middle of this range were left then the sky would look a lot whiter			2
it would work because the only reason the sky is blue in the first place is because air molecules are scattered			0
such scattering is more pronounced among blue molecules as they have shorter wavelengths than longer red ones			2
by putting aerosol particles in the atmosphere however the red ones would be scattered the most , washing out the blue and making the sky whiter			1
@entity0 said that a whiter sky might have a daily effect on people ’s attitudes toward climate change			2
visitors to @entity75 for the @entity76 for example were disturbing by the never ending fogginess caused by rampant pollution			0
@entity0 said that people in the countryside would see the effect most severely , though it would be apparent from anywhere in the world			0
he said : ‘ all you 'd have to do to see it is to step outside			0
’ other knock - on effects would be a rise in plant and tree growth because they would be getting more indirect sunlight			0
but the solar industry would suffer as there would be less direct sunlight to power solar panels , perhaps forcing man to rely even more on fossil fuels .			0

aerosol spray into *upper* atmosphere could reflect light away from @entity22
scattering of red particles around @entity22 could ' wash ' sky white
effect visible everywhere on @entity22
most *intense* outside towns
