before the hammer fell : in a @entity11 speech , just the pictured pregnant woman famously fell , @entity0 called @entity85 's story , which she emailed to the @entity12 , ' what the @entity8 is all about ' just in time : the president turns around and catches @entity13 just as she 's about to faint , and the man standing behind her grabs her shoulders help : @entity13 is then escorted away			1
she later tweeted that she was feeling ok now and thanked mr @entity0 ms @entity13 , who represented the @entity91 , said she was honored to attend the event			1
' it was an honor to be there and i 'm rather sorry i fainted in the middle of the speech , but i was really happy to be able to be on stage at that moment , ' she told @entity70			1

' in her spare time , she says she enjoys ' people , @entity128 , rock climbing , and the pursuit of life , liberty , and happiness			0
' however , it did n't take long before skeptics started suggesting the health scare was a fake and ms @entity13 was planted there by the @entity0 administration			2
but her husband insisted the near - collapse was no fake			0
ms @entity13 became dizzy towards the end of a defiant speech during which mr @entity0 said he was mad about problems with the new health care website , but argued that the @entity8 as a whole is working as planned			1
while @entity148 ' has n't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work , ' @entity0 said during the @entity12 speech that once - uninsured @entity150 have signed up for coverage and are receiving benefits , ' the product -- the health insurance -- is good , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' the prices are good			0
it is a good deal			0
' feeling better : ms @entity13 , pictured here in 2012 , has suffered diabetes since she was 9 and is a major advocate of the @entity8 couple : her husband @entity161 , pictured with her , tweeted that he almost went to her aid on stage but thought the @entity51 might get confused facing attacks from @entity166 and other critics of @entity8 , the president said his health care team is reaching out to tech experts to help fix massive website problems that have hampered the rollout of his landmark piece of legislation			2
' nobody 's madder than me about the fact that the website is n't working as well as it should , ' mr @entity0 said , ' which means it 's going to get fixed			2
