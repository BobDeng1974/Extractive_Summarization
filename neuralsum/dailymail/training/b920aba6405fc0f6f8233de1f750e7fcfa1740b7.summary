the need for @entity2 coal aided the nation through the @entity4 and fueled the economy when it needed it most			1
however , under new restrictions enforced by @entity9 's powerful @entity8 , an import ban has been flagged for certain low - grade imported coal			2
created with the aim of reducing pollution and improving air quality , the restrictions are set to be enacted from january 1 , 2015 , leaving many wondering how the fallout will impact the @entity2 coal industry , which may be exposed to billions of dollars in lost sales due to the changes			1
the restrictions apply to coal with more than 16 per cent ash and 1 per cent sulphur , a far cry from the @entity2 coal standard			2
@entity2 coal typically contains 24 - 25 % ash , said @entity40 of @entity41 , @entity2 exports an estimated 49 million tonnes of thermal coal a year to @entity9 , and about 39 percent of this may be excluded if the proposal becomes law , said @entity47 analysts in a september 4 report			1
coal from 28 mines around @entity2 would be affected , the largest of which is located in @entity53 , @entity54 , which stands at 170 million tonnes			1
resource exporters have been left to clarify what the new regulations will actually mean for the industry			0
senior industry analyst at @entity60 , @entity61 , said that the restrictions with provide additional challenges in an area where producers are already under a lot of pressure			0
' thermal coal exports for the last financial year totaled $ 16.4 billion			1
' ' these regulations will increase production cost in certain countries such as @entity2 , making other countries much more competitive			0
' ' thermal coal is found all over the world , so @entity2 does n't have a monopoly on it			1
' @entity77 , senior resource analyst at @entity78 said that @entity9 had been discussing making the changes for several years , and that whilst the decision should n't come as a surprise to the coal industry , there would be a notable impact on @entity2 's thermal coal exports			1
' coal prices are under significant pressure anyway			0
' ' since the @entity4 there has n't been the same demand for coal			0
' the restrictions apply to coal with more than 16 per cent ash and 1 per cent sulphur , a far cry from the @entity2 coal standard			2
countries such as the @entity98 have started exporting coal , flooding the market and pushing prices down			0
' ' if @entity9 does indeed implement this ban and stick to it , i would think there would be a reasonable impact on the coal industry because there would be a large amount of coal which does n't meet the new standards			2
' ' @entity2 is one of the biggest exporters of coal to @entity9			1
companies such as @entity116 and @entity117 are currently producing coal that would n't meet the criteria			0
' ' they are probably putting a brave face on at the moment			0
' @entity123 , president of @entity41 at @entity116 said , ' we support efforts to improve environmental standards , ' ' we expect to be capable of meeting the proposed @entity8 regulations , which stipulate a range of quality limits for both domestic and imported coal , should they be finalised and implemented , and do not anticipate a material impact to our business			0
' however , mr @entity77 has raised the problem of coal produced in @entity2 which does fail to meet the standards			2
' the issue is , what will @entity2 do with coal that does nâ€™t meet the standards ? ' ' are there ways they could wash or upgrade it to minise the harmful elements ? if they can , would the cost of doing so be economically viable in the long run ? ' the highest restrictions will be placed upon coal usage in high - density areas in the north of @entity9 , such as @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , and areas around @entity155 , as well as cities in the southern @entity157 and the eastern @entity158			1
the @entity159 of @entity2 have labelled the concerns as ' misleading an unnecessarily alarmist ' however , the @entity161 has downplayed the concerns , calling the reports that the move would devastate @entity2 's multi-billion dollar exports to the @entity167 economic powerhouse ' misleading and unnecessarily alarmist ... ' ' the future for @entity2 's $ 2.7 billion annual coal trade with @entity9 remains strong			1
' @entity170 , executive director of coal at the @entity161 said that the main coal type affected was brown coal ( lignite ) , which @entity2 does not export , and low quality domestic black coal			0
' to the extent it impacts imports of black coal destined for northern cities this relates to small scale coal use , not large scale power plants or other industrial users , ' said mr @entity170			0
' there is nothing in the information which suggests that @entity2 coal exporters will be disadvantaged and we are confident that we can meet the proposed specifications , ' ' @entity2 is fortunate to have reserves of high quality black coal , which will continue to be in strong demand from established and emerging markets , including @entity9			1
' ' coal production has exceeded the demand , ' said mr @entity77 ' there is only one way coal prices will go , and that is down			0

@entity9 to implement new restrictions on coal imports to reduce pollution
experts say this could ' significantly affect the @entity2 economy '
@entity2 exports an estimated 49 million tonnes of thermal coal to @entity9
however the @entity159 of @entity2 has said the reports are ' alarmist '
