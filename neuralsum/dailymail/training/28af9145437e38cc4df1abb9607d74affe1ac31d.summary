click here to view all the stats and graphics from @entity4 's win over @entity5 using our fantastic match zone service there was a punch of the air , a handshake with @entity12 then a cursory acknowledgement of the fans in the @entity15 before @entity16 scurried down the tunnel			1
hurrying for sanctuary is something @entity16 has had to do a lot of in recent months , as @entity4 supporters aimed their venom at him , enraged by the erratic performances and confidence - sapping results of his team			1
on this occasion @entity16 should have hung around			2
as acclaim rang around @entity29 after a doughty win over @entity5 , secured by @entity31 , @entity4 ’s manager would have appreciated he is no longer public enemy no 1			1
the incident seemed to sum up another frustrating afternoon for the @entity64 striker @entity4 : @entity65 6.5 , @entity49 7.5 , @entity66 7.5 , @entity67 7 , @entity68 7 , @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 6.5 , @entity71 6 ( @entity72 27 , 6 ) , @entity32 8.5 , @entity73 6 ( @entity44 66 , 6.5 ) , @entity74 5.5 ( @entity31 46 , 7 )			1

man of the match : @entity32			1
proof of that was all around			2
in the @entity104 , some fans unfurled a banner reading ‘ backpardew.com ’ while before kick - off , a lone supporter , dressed as the @entity107 , held a placard proclaiming ‘ @entity109 ’			2
‘ it is @entity112 , ’ said @entity16 with a wry smile			2
‘ @entity113 had some dark days here , do n’t worry about that			0
if you are @entity4 manager , it is not all gin and tonics and aperitifs			1
there will be rough days			0
i kept saying that we have good spirit and good talent			0
‘ i ’m not saying i saw the wins coming but i knew there was talent			0
it will be fantastic in the town tonight			0
i might even go in myself — the first time for a while			0
that is what this city is about			0
‘ when it does not go well they let you know and when it is going well , they let you know			0
you take the good with the bad			0
’ and , at this moment , it is good			0
that goal from @entity31 ensured a week that began with a victory at @entity145 , followed by a win over @entity147 in the @entity148 , ended as it started			1
@entity4 have momentum and @entity16 knows it			1
but what of @entity5 ? their campaign of false starts shows no signs of turning and if @entity12 was looking for a jolt of confidence before tuesday ’s daunting trip to @entity159 , he was left bitterly disappointed			1
the problems he has are no closer to being solved			0
‘ i did n’t think we deserved to lose but did n’t do enough to win it , ’ he observed			2
‘ we had enough of the ball but just lacked that bit of creativity and invention in the final third			0
but we made a mistake and that has unfortunately cost us the game			2
that is the biggest disappointment			0
’ this is the highest - scoring contest in the history of the @entity41 but you would never have guessed that following a turgid opening 45 minutes			0
a spark was missing from both sides and their respective movement was , at best , pedestrian			0
@entity32 goes down in the box under a challenge from @entity86 , but referee @entity100 waved away penalty appeals @entity32 goes to ground after @entity86 's challenge , but replays showed that the tackle was a fair one and @entity100 's decision was correct @entity32 lies floored in the area as team - mate @entity71 appeals in vain in front of the baying home fans @entity50 was once again a peripheral figure , with the £ 16million man flattering to deceive on @entity193 @entity4 's @entity74 wastes a free kick in a promising position by blasting it over just before the break @entity68 ( right ) keeps a watchful distance from @entity5 's @entity85 as the tricky winger attempts to keep possession @entity36 ( right ) tussles with @entity4 's @entity73 as the @entity60 man skips down the right @entity71 ( left ) skips @entity84 's tackle , but the @entity204 reared up after appearing to suffer a hamstring injury @entity84 stands over a prostrate @entity71 after the @entity4 man suffered a freak injury on the right wing @entity71 was taken off on a stretcher in the 25th minute with his injury causing an early headache for boss @entity16 on the touchline , in their technical areas , @entity16 and @entity12 fidgeted with frustration as moves broke down following sloppy passes or lacked the wit to cause problems			1
of the two , @entity12 was more unhappy , turning to his assistant regularly to express his impatience			0
@entity12 was almost tearing his hair out in the 37th minute when @entity4 had the first big chance			1
had they scored , it would again have been down to defensive deficiencies , as goalkeeper @entity35 came for a corner and got nowhere near it , presenting a chance to @entity74			0
@entity5 had a reprieve , though , as @entity82 was in the right place to cover @entity35 and headed @entity74 ’s tame shot off the line and away from danger			2
aside from a couple of half - hearted penalty shouts , that was as good as it got for @entity4 before the break			1
@entity32 was all over the shop - click here for more stats from our @entity239 man - of - the - match @entity32 was a constant nuisance for @entity4 , patrolling the pitch with skill and guile @entity16 ( left ) and @entity12 sport similar looks on the sidelines as both bosses watch the action unfold @entity4 show their support for fans ' favourite @entity251 , who is battling testicular cancer a @entity4 fan holds a banner supporting the @entity4 boss after his side 's recent renaissance @entity4 's @entity69 ( left ) vies for the ball with @entity50 as both teams look for an early foothold in the game the visitors , perhaps , should have gone in with a lead			1
in the 40th minute , a typically precise corner from @entity88 found @entity83 but , having escaped @entity66 ’s attentions , he planted his header the wrong side of a post			0
@entity270 miles @entity4 113.4 70.5 @entity271 90 12.2 7.6 @entity70 90 11.9 7.4 @entity49 90 10.9 6.8 @entity5 107.2 66.6 @entity89 90 11.1 6.9 @entity88 90 11.1 6.9 @entity36 90 10.8 6.7 an advantage at that stage would not have been merited but , belatedly , @entity5 emerged with more intent after the restart and twice in the opening five minutes @entity50 made @entity65 work , first with a free - kick , then with a curling shot			1
once @entity50 got involved , @entity5 looked slightly more efficient but , as has been the case so often this season , they could not sustain their good play for a prolonged spell and when they began to lose direction , @entity4 sensed an opportunity			1
with the home crowd turning up the noise , @entity4 began to press and in the 71st minute , they were rewarded			1
at the heart of it was the imperious @entity32 — who , @entity12 said , should have been sent off for a foul on @entity86 — driving into @entity5 ’s penalty area , spreading panic on the way			1
@entity32 looked to free @entity44 but as @entity36 tried to stab away the danger , he succeeded only in turning the ball into @entity31 ’s path and he gleefully swept his opportunity beyond the helpless @entity35			1
one goal should have become two in the next attack as @entity4 sped forward after @entity5 lost possession			1
@entity31 and @entity44 ended up in a position where they up against @entity82 but @entity35 kept @entity5 in the game , saving with his feet when @entity44 seemed certain to score			1
his miss did not matter			0
@entity5 lacked the gumption to stage a grandstand finish and , ultimately , @entity4 saw the contest out comfortably and the celebrations were typically noisy			1
@entity16 , however , chose to enjoy the moment on his own			0
‘ i would like to think i am coming out of this a better manager , ’ said @entity16			0
‘ it has been interesting and educational			0
‘ it tests you , this football club , on a number of levels			0
but this was a great day for us			0
’ @entity83 shows his flexibility ahead of kick - off as the @entity327 defender runs through his pre-match stretches @entity4 owner @entity329 grins as he observes matters from the stands , wearing his customary matchday attire like @entity334 's facebook page .			2

@entity31 *capitalises* on some *lacklustre* defending in the box to prod home the only goal of the game
@entity4 romped to their third straight win , while @entity5 have already lost four this season
@entity50 was once again *ineffective* and endured a frustrating afternoon for the visitors
@entity4 saw a penalty appeal waved away after @entity86 tackled @entity32 in the box
