conservative mps are plotting a rebellion against prime minister @entity0 next week when the @entity11 debate will call for the @entity13 to honour its commitment to spend at least 2 % of its income on defence but mr @entity0 has refused to guarantee that the spending pledge will continue after the election , and – to the anger of many mps – @entity2 sources say it will not feature in the party ’s manifesto			1
instead , the prime minister has said only that a future @entity2 government would protect the defence equipment budget and maintain troop numbers			1
foreign secretary @entity41 was yesterday reported to have warned @entity32 there are ‘ no votes in defence ’			0
aides to mr @entity41 , a former defence secretary , said they ‘ did not recognise the comments ’ , adding that the minister is a staunch supporter of defence spending			1
but former defence minister sir @entity49 said the reported comments were symptomatic of the view of the party leadership			0
sir @entity49 , mp for @entity55 , said : ‘ there is a view at the top of the government – i do n’t think the prime minister shares it – that defence is n’t a vote winner			0
foreign secretary @entity41 ( pictured ) was reported to have warned @entity32 there are ‘ no votes in defence ’ ‘ but what they have to understand is that defence is part of the @entity71 of the @entity2			2
and that ’s true even in constituencies which do n’t have a garrison			0
‘ conservative voters instinctively believe that defence of the realm is the first priority of government			2
’ ‘ and if people around the country do not see that is the case they will ask themselves what is the @entity2 for ? ’ ‘ we are following through a @entity87 promise to spend 0.7 per cent on aid but we wo n’t commit to defence spending			1
people are asking is this the right order of priorities ? ’ @entity93 , chairman of the commons defence committee said : ‘ the fundamental point is the world is unfortunately more dangerous now than it has been in the past 20 years at least			0
‘ that means major powers like @entity13 have to spend more on defence			1
’ fellow @entity2 @entity101 said it would be a major error for @entity13 to drop its guard at a time of increased @entity105 aggression and the growing threat from @entity107			1
mr @entity101 said : ‘ the people of the @entity13 want to see strong defence of the realm , and they see the attacks carried out by @entity112 and the @entity114 bombers over @entity115 and they realise the world is an extremely dangerous place			2
and they want the government to step up and hold to the promise they made at the @entity22			0
’ conservative mps now plan to use a @entity11 debate next thursday to force a vote on the issue			1
a senior @entity2 mp last night said there was a ‘ determination ’ to force a vote , despite pressure from @entity130 to avoid a damaging split in the run - up to the election			2
although the vote will not be binding on government policy , defeat would be embarrassing for the @entity2 leadership and increase the pressure on ministers to back the spending target			2
@entity140 is to boost its military budget by 10 per cent this year to £ 94billion , making it the world ’s second - biggest spender on defence			2
last year , it spent £ 85billion , compared with @entity13 ’s £ 37.4billion – but that is still only around a third of what the @entity148 spends			0
@entity150 is seeking to assert itself as a growing power and officials say the money is to modernise the @entity155 – the world ’s largest standing military force			0
@entity140 's growing force : only the @entity148 spends more on defence the @entity148 fears that @entity140 considerably understates its actual defence spending			1
@entity150 has recently taken a more assertive stance on territorial disputes with @entity163 and other neighbours , leading to a rise in regional tensions			0
in response , @entity163 and @entity167 have increased their military budgets .			0
