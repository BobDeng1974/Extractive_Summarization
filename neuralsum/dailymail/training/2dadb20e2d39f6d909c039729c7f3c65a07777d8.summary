by @entity0 a trio of lazy lions decided that they did n't need to do the hard work in order to enjoy a nice evening meal after stealing food from a leopard			2
the leopard , who had been stalking his prey for the past 45 minutes , had successfully killed the impala and decided to hoist his meal onto a branch of a tree in @entity16			1
unfortunately for the leopard , a pack of lions were also close by , watching and waiting for the precise moment to strike			0
@entity21 : a leopard is successful in collecting its evening meal after stalking an impala in the @entity26 sand game reserve in @entity16 climb : after gathering its kill , the leopard impressively hoists the impala into a tree supper : the leopard now has his evening meal in place , however , he is not the only one around wildlife photographer @entity35 said : ' seeing the leopard stalk , chase and catch an impala is special , it is an exhilarating feeling			1
' ' we waited for about 45 minutes while the leopard stalked and eventually caught the impala , the leopard then hoisted the kill and about five minutes later the @entity43 appeared on the scene			1
' the 41 - year - old @entity16 captured this encounter at night , while leading a wildlife photographic safari through the @entity48 game reserve in @entity16			1
however , even with 14 years of experience photographing wildlife , mr @entity35 was stunned by the lions ' next move			2
the lions bounded for the tree and began fighting over the impala while trying to keep their balance on the branches , allowing for the leopard to escape unharmed			2
safe spot : the leopard hides his catch in a tree but he has now become aware that he has company in the form of three lions free food : the lions come bounding towards the tree and frantically start to climb fight : once the lions climb the tree , their attention turns to fighting each other for the impala mr @entity35 , who lives in @entity75 , @entity16 , said : ' i have never seen lions climb trees like this but i know they can do it , so i was not surprised by the behaviour but it was great to see in real life			1
' to watch the lions approach was very tense			0
we did n't want any harm to come to the leopard and we were relieved when the leopard managed to get away unharmed			0
' it actually became quite comical and funny to watch the lions climb the tree , with their big bodies trying to balance in the branches while also trying to eat and compete with each other for the food			0
' mr @entity35 has documented both lions and leopards for several years , learning the process of how they both hunt their prey			2
he added : ' i have watched both leopards and lions hunting before and i know it can be a long slow process but also exciting			0
' often the hunts are unsuccessful so when the leopard made the kill it was extra exciting and special to then watch the leopard hoist the kill into the tree			0
these animals can lift a heavy carcass almost effortlessly			0
' wildlife : the photographs were taken by wildlife photographer @entity35 , who described the lions as comical as they struggled to balance as they attempted to take the impala for themselves			1

the leopard stalked and killed an impala for an exhausting 45 minutes and *stashed* his prey in a tree for dinner
however a pride of lions saw an *opportunity* for a free meal , climbed the tree , grabbed the impala and ate it
the photos were taken by wildlife photographer @entity35 in @entity48 game reserve in @entity16
