by @entity0 last updated at 7:41 pm on 6th december 2011 @entity1 is the second - largest object in the asteroid belt - 320 miles across - and is being probed by a hi - tech robot ' surveyor ' that will then move on to its bigger ' sister ' asteroid @entity8			1
new views sent back by the probe , @entity11 , this week , reveal an object more like a planet than an asteroid - and scientists say they now consider it a ' transitional body ' between the two			1
the @entity11 spacecraft has been beaming back images since july - the latest show a rugged surface is unique compared to the solar system ’s much smaller and lightweight asteroids			2
the latest pictures from @entity24 's @entity11 show that the moon is ' more like a planet ' than an asteroid , scientists revealed on monday impact craters dot @entity1 ’s surface along with grooves , troughs and a variety of minerals			1
' @entity1 is unlike any other asteroid , ' said mission co-scientist @entity35 of the @entity36 in @entity37			2
the new findings were presented at a meeting of the @entity40 in @entity41			0
this image using color data obtained by the framing camera aboard @entity24 's @entity11 spacecraft shows @entity1 's southern hemisphere in color , centered on the @entity49 formation - the different colours reflect different minerals in the surface			1
@entity49 is an impact basin measured at about 290 miles ( 467 kilometers ) in diameter with a central mound reaching about 14 miles ( 23 kilometers ) high			0
the black hole in the middle is data that have been omitted due to the angle between the sun , @entity1 and the spacecraft			0
most asteroids resemble potatoes , but @entity1 is more like an avocado with its iron core , @entity35 said			0
@entity66 of @entity67 considers @entity1 a ' transitional body ' between rocky planets and the thousands of asteroids floating between @entity71 and @entity72 asteroids are remnants from the birth of the solar system some 4.5 billion years ago around the same time as the formation of the rocky planets including @entity79			1
studying asteroids can offer clues about how our planetary system began			0
instead of returning to the moon , @entity24 has decided to land astronauts on a yet - to - be determined asteroid as a stepping stone to @entity71			1
@entity66 of @entity67 considers @entity1 a ' transitional body ' between rocky planets and the thousands of asteroids floating between @entity71 and @entity72			1
the mission has yielded a mystery			0
before @entity11 arrived at @entity1 , scientists predicted that the surface would harbor a volcano			2
there ’s a hill on @entity1 , but researchers said there ’s no evidence of lava flow or volcanic deposits			0
@entity66 said it ’s possible the volcanic materials are buried , so the team will keep looking			0
powered by ion propulsion instead of conventional rocket fuel , @entity11 will study @entity1 for several more months before cruising to an even bigger asteroid , @entity8 , where it will arrive in 2015 .			2

now considered a ' transitional body ' between an asteroid and a planet
rugged , pitted surface is rich in minerals
@entity24 probe will *fly* on to its ' big sister ' @entity8 next
