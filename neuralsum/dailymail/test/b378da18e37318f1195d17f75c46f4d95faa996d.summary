the idea of a device that constantly keeps an eye on your home and can tell you which electrical devices are running at any one time , may sound appealing when it comes to saving energy and money			1
now there ’s a device called @entity12 that claims to make any ' ordinary home smart ’ and even tells you when you 've accidently left lights on			1
the $ 250 ( £ 168 ) device recognises the electronic signature of different devices - such as kettles and washing machines - allowing users to keep an eye on their energy consumption and even control appliances through their phone			1
it recognises the electronic signature of different devices , such as kettles and washing machines , allowing users to keep an eye on their energy consumption and even control appliances through their phone ‘ we are trying to create one sensor that can make every home smart , ’ @entity37 , co-founder of @entity12 told @entity38			1
‘ it creates that intelligence for all of the dumb products that are already in your home and that you do n't want to replace			0
’ its website says : ‘ using a @entity57 power sensor and a cloud service with some smart pattern detection algorithms , @entity12 monitors your home 's electricity to figure out what your appliances are up to - without the need to install sensors on every device			1
’ @entity12 feeds information about energy consumption of the devices it ’s recognised back to an app , where users can make decisions about how to save power and money by turning gadgets off , for instance			1
these screenshots show the home screen ( left ) , appliances recognised ( centre ) and usage for one day ( right ) the @entity30 sensor is plugged into the house ’s breaker panel , or circuit box			1
it measures both differential voltage and current signals every split second and these signals are used to calculate power and energy consumption			1
the measurements are sent to the @entity88 where algorithms identify appliances and behaviours based on unique electronic signals			0
when the algorithms detect that a device has been turned on or off , or a user returning home , they notify the @entity30 app and services such as @entity100 which allows devices to be controlled from smartphones			1
the app , which is available for @entity104 and @entity106 phones and tablets , gives users real - time feedback about their home			2
it tells them which appliances are greedily consuming energy , for example			0
the device plugs into a breaker box , or circuit box in a house where it gradually learns to recognise the electric ‘ signature ’ of different gadgets and appliances			2
users can train @entity12 to recognise a light bulb for example , by flicking a light on and off to tell the accompanying app what to detect			0
alternatively , an algorithm allows it to learn for itself based on crowdsourced information , to tell it what a microwave ’s signature looks like , for example			0
@entity12 feeds information about energy consumption of the devices it ’s recognised back to an app , where users can make decisions about how to save power and money by turning gadgets off , for instance			1
‘ it you will even gently nag you if you forget to turn off the lights before going to bed , ’ the website says			0
‘ … some customers have saved as much as 44 per cent on their energy usage			0
’ because it monitors the home around the clock , @entity12 can give owners peace of mind if they think they have left their oven switched on , for example			0
the device monitors a home around the clock so it can tell users if they have left their oven on , if their washing is finished and if the water is cold ( all illustrated )			2
when used with another app , @entity12 can be used to turn appliances and household devices on and off remotely it can also be used to keep an eye on inhabitants , by showing if relatives are eating regularly or if children are spending too long watching television , for example			2
the device can send reminders to take washing out of the machine when the cycle is complete , for example			0
and it also allows users to control home appliances remotely by using apps such as @entity100 , to start a washing machine while they are out , for example			2
@entity12 is open platform so it can work with smart devices such as the @entity193 too .			0
