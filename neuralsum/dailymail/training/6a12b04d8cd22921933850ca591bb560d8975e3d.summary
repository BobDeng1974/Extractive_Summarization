by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 10:51 est , 19 july 2013 a first time mum - to - be at 35 , @entity0 writes in a weekly column on @entity3 about fertility issues , the ups and downs of pregnancy and ultimately the joys and stress of motherhood for the career girl who may have come a bit late to the party , but is happy to be here just the same ... as i wandered , contraction - ridden through the overheated hallways of the labour ward at @entity19 , i wondered if i had made a serious mistake in choosing to give birth here			1
@entity22 woes : @entity0 did n't realise how much havoc having a baby would wreak on her body no , not because of the overcrowding , the long wait to see a doctor , the desperately hot atmosphere ( i was told that despite the warm temperatures outside , the heaters were still running and no one knew how to turn them off ) but because i was surrounded by women who appeared to have arrived straight from a photo shoot			1
there was not one mum to be bigger than a size 10 ( @entity41 size 6 ) , hair was freshly blown out , nails immaculate and they ’d perfected that whole ' i have make up on but it looks like i do n’t ' look			1
i arrived swollen , sweating and irritable , in the only item of maternity clothes that still fit me , with hair that could have used a washing and at least three sizes bigger than anyone else			1
i could n’t believe it			1
had n’t anyone else gained weight in any place other than their picture perfect tiny bumps ? i felt like a hippo who had wandered into a savanna populated only by gazelles			1
after a difficult birth which culminated in an unplanned c - section , i was over the moon delighted to bring home my beautiful , healthy baby girl			2
everything i had heard about the all consuming love you feel for this little person was true			2
it was completely life - changing ; and beyond my greatest expectations			2
it was also hugely difficult			2
i ’d anticipated challenges with breast feeding , lack of sleep , shifting hormones and recovering from the surgery , and i found them			1
however , what i was totally unprepared for is the state of my body after childbirth			2
naively , i had expected to walk out of that hospital not looking pregnant anymore			2
the reality was that in addition to still appearing to be deep into my second trimester , i actually looked heavier than ever , as my nine month sized bump had served to distract from what was going on with the rest of me , which had now aggressively re-emerged from the background			2
seeing myself for the first time out of the shower was jarring			2
i wish more women had warned me about how that might feel			2
the first time i saw myself in a mirror post baby , the angry purple stretch marks , the milk - heavy breasts , the excess , loose skin on my formerly pilates - honed abs , was truly demoralising			1
some of it was due to the baby of course , but to some degree , much of it was my own doing			2
having not thought about my weight or denied myself anything food-wise for the past nine months , i was left with the result			1
i realised that i had a mountain to climb and felt entirely unprepared			2
tough : like @entity117 's wife @entity116 , 27 , getting her pre-baby figure back has proved challenging for @entity0 gathering up my courage , i decided to tackle things head on and step on the scales			1
to my shock and horror i discovered i was 20 pounds heavier than when i had gone into the hospital ! i had delivered a nine pound baby - how could that possibly be ? as i expressed my dismay and began frantically googling , i noticed a sheepish expression flicker across my husband ’s face			1
apparently , when i ’d decided on impulse to weigh myself a week before i was due to give birth ( after having avoided the scales through most of the second and all of the third trimester ) my husband had shaved off a solid 25 pounds - being unable to see the digital read out myself over my massive belly			1
' i knew you ’d be upset , ' he said guilty , ' and you had enough to worry about , so i knocked off a few pounds when you asked me what it said			1
' the man clearly knows me too well			2
while it may have been insightful at the time , i was now left with a bitter and very unappealing truth about the state of things			2
a stone heavier than normal when i ’d conceived , i had gained another three stone during the pregnancy			1
i thought about celebrities like @entity150 who managed to shift 80 pounds of pregnancy weight in three months before heading back to work on a film			1
i was amazed at her self discipline and openly coveted her daily trainer , nannies and personal chef			2
the famously self - disciplined @entity159 told @entity160 that after the birth of her baby @entity162 , she headed straight to the gym and followed a workout regime prepared by celebrity trainer @entity165			1
' i worked out a lot			0
i did it six days a week			0
i become quite obsessive when i get into something			0
' @entity170 was back on stage within several months of giving birth @entity172 and wearing sexy catsuits that showed off a stunning post-pregnancy body			0
she said at the time , ' y’all have no idea how hard i worked			0
i had to lose 60 pounds			1
they had me on that treadmill			0
i ate lettuce ! ' comparing myself to these women just made me feel more inadequate			0
i felt completely out of my league			0
exhausted i could barely function let alone imagine working out			0
in fact , due to my surgery , i had been warned off working out for 8 - 12 weeks			0
slimline : thanks to trainer @entity188 , @entity159 swiftly got back into shape after @entity162 's birth demoralising : both @entity170 and @entity191 got their bodies back but admit it was hard work tiring : instead of seeing her next pregnancy as a holiday , @entity0 will treat it like an @entity200 challenge as i struggled with night feeds , breast feeding and taking care of my new baby , i still could n’t shake off the new and awful feeling that i no longer felt like myself			1
my life looked nothing like it had before and i was walking around in a body that just did n’t feel like my own			0
needing to heal and advised to wait until exercising , i made a few big decisions in the weeks to come			0
i stopped stepping on the scales for one			0
i knew it would take time to get back to a place where i felt good , and i did n’t want the pressure of worrying about numbers			0
i also immediately ordered some clothes in sizes that would have formerly filled me with dread - but that actually fit me at the weight i now was			1
therefore i could stop picking through my meagre and well worn selection of maternity gear			0
and lastly i made a decision to treat myself to a diet home delivery food programme			1
knowing i had no time to shop for healthy food , the energy to prepare it or the discipline to meal plan , i figured after what i ’d been through i deserved it			0
i chose soulmate foods because i ’d heard the food was good and they were able to tailor a programme for breast feeding mums like myself			0
all three decisions were good ones for me			0
it began to dawn on me that i ought to endeavour to love and care for my altered and changed body the way i loved my new baby			0
putting up with all indignities without hesitation and forgiving everything without question			0
these were the first of many steps i knew it would take to get back to a place that felt like me			0
it was going to be a long journey but ultimately i would focus on keeping my baby healthy and trying to be patient with what my body could now do			0
as a mother over 35 i was learning the hard way that it ’s especially vital to be in great physical shape when having a baby			0
after all , we are already pushing our bodies to do something it would have physically preferred to do a decade ago			0
we are asking a tremendous amount of our bodies – and maintaining optimum health and fitness before and during our pregnancies seems the least we can do in return			0
indeed , next time i get pregnant , if there is a next time , i will do things very differently			0
in her wonderful book , how to be a woman , @entity277 talks about her second pregnancy and says : ' this time around though , i ’m doing things differently			1
for starters , i have n’t spent the last two months of my pregnancy thinking , " let @entity281 last forever ! every morning can start with two mince pies , served with cream , six miniature heroes , and some @entity285 ! it ’s @entity287 - mas ! hurrah for pregnant me ! " ' as a result , i have n’t put on forty pounds , and i ’m capable of things like " walking " , " standing " , and " getting off the sofa without making an ' @entity293 "			1
' looking back , my biggest error was not viewing my pregnancy from a physical fitness perspective			1
it ’s a gruelling physical challenge requiring a great deal of preparation and constant care			1
afterwards , i felt like i had run a marathon that i ’d prepared for by walking around the block			0
indeed , beleaguered by morning sickness at points and tiredness at others , i treated my pregnancy in its entirety like it was a condition or illness ; resting , taking it easy , pampering myself – whereas i will view the next one like the @entity200 challenge it is			1
catch up with the latest installment of @entity0 's trials and tribulations next week .			1

@entity0 treated her pregnancy like an illness and piled on the pounds
found the *miracle* weight loss of celebrity mothers demoralising
has decided to treat next pregnancy like an @entity200 challenge
