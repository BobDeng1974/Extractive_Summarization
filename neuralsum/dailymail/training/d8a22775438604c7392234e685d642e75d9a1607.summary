by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 13:37 est , 24 may 2012 the controversial replacements for the harrier jump jets may cost taxpayers even more than their £ 500million asking price - because the heat from take off could melt aircraft carriers ' decks			1
the fumes from the @entity10 @entity9 are so hot that special heat - resistant paint will be required to protect the take - off strip			1
but @entity10 military experts are still developing the coating , which the @entity15 will now have to beg for as well as the new planes			0
takeoff : fumes from the f - 35 jump jet can damage ships ' decks , @entity10 tests have revealed the flaw is the latest problem to hit the ministry of defence 's 6.2billion plan for two new aircraft carriers after scrapping the @entity28 and selling off the @entity29			1
it comes just two weeks after defence secretary @entity31 was forced into an embarrassing u-turn over the purchase of the new jets			2
he scrapped plans to replace the @entity29 with conventional @entity37 planes , which take off from an runway , when the £ 2billion cost of fitting the new warships with catapult take - off systems was discovered			2
the government then had to revert to the previous @entity45 government 's plan to purchase 12 @entity47 ' jump jets ' , at a cost of up to £ 500million each			0
the turnaround cost taxpayers an estimated £ 250million			0
the new heat - resistant ' @entity51 ' coating has been developed in @entity10 after @entity10 tests showed that exhausts from the jets could melt ships ' decks			1
expense : the 170,000 square ft @entity56 will have to be covered with heat - resistant paint u-turn : the @entity59 committed to purchasing 12 £ 500m jump jets in an embarrassing turnaround this month wasted : the @entity63 's entire fleet of @entity29 was refitted at a cost of millions just before @entity66 's defence review scrapped the entire fleet and sold them to the @entity10 an @entity59 spokesman said the cost of the new paint would be ' negligible ' and were ' greatly offset ' by the savings from not fitting the £ 2billion ' cats and traps ' to the aircraft carriers			1
' work to identify a suitable deck coat is ongoing so exact costs are not yet available , ' the spokesman said			0
the new aircraft carriers , @entity56 and @entity80 , are set to be completed in 2020			1
the project has been branded an ' omnishambles ' by @entity84 spokesman @entity83			0
a spokesman for the @entity59 said : ' the @entity59 will save £ 2bn by not fitting " cats and traps " and this will greatly offset the relatively small cost of specialist deck coating which has always been factored into our plans			2
' deck coating was always part of the @entity96 variant ship specification			0
work to identify a suitable deck coating paint is ongoing with our @entity10 partners in this project			0

@entity59 must pay for heat - resistant paint on new warships
exhausts from jet takeoff can damage aircraft carriers
news comes two weeks after £ 250m u-turn on new jets
