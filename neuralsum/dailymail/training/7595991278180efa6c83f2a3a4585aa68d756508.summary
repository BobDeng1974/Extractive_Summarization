they live in the @entity1 that straddle @entity3 's southern border with @entity4 but take orders from neither government , instead living their lives under the dictates of tribal law			1
meet the ' flower men ' , a tribe of people descended from the ancient @entity14 and @entity15 groupings and whose traditions , most strikingly the garlands of herbs and blooms they wear , date back more than two millennia			1
but as photographer @entity21 discovered , they are the source of much unrest in the region , conducting cross-border battles and reacting violently should any outsider stumble into their turf - including to @entity21 himself			1
' that remained the case until the early 1990s when the @entity3 government , keen to boost tourism in the region , built cable cars to the villages and hotels for tourists to stay in			1
but with many of the flower men forced out of their homes by the development , clashes soon erupted and the area remains volatile - not least because of the turmoil in neighbouring @entity4			2
' i had planned to be in the area for a few days but quickly realised it would be very difficult , ' @entity21 revealed in an exclusive interview with @entity74			0
' i had to stop and get a local escort of policemen before i could go into the area			0
' the policemen told me some of the local people really hate foreigners , while even @entity3 people are n't welcome in some villages			1
' as a result , when @entity21 arrived in the village of @entity84 , the locals ' initial response was to hide			0
' there were a few old women about who hid from me as soon as i tried to approach them			0
' restorative : garlands made exclusively for medicinal purposes , such as the one this man is wearing , are less pretty and stuffed with herbs intricate : this garland is made from woven marigold heads , although most are made using fragrant wild jasmine and basil sweet - smelling : although cooler than the desert that dominates the rest of @entity3 , the mountains are hot and the herbs ward off bad smells excitement : the men rarely see outsiders and locals reacted excitedly when @entity21 first arrived , with this man calling his friends to tell them striking : the men , who all live in a small village called @entity15 , were initially happy to tell @entity21 about their garlands and pose for photos @entity113 : they explained that they go into the foothills of the @entity117 every morning in search of fresh herbs for their garlands looking good : they told @entity21 that they all compete with each other to make the most beautiful garlands they can ' when i arrived in the village , it was market day and a few old women were there			1
they hid themselves from me as soon as i tried to come towards them			0
' the men , however , proved more amenable with @entity21 able to photograph a group of flower - decked men who screeched up in the back of a battered old @entity135			2
he was fascinated by their garlands , most of which were made using wild basil and jasmine picked in the foothills of the @entity1			1
' they do it every day , ' he explains			0
' they all want to look better than their neighbours			0
' not every garland is worn for its beauty , however			0
' they use similar herbs as a cure for headaches , ' he explains			0
' but those garlands are n't so beautiful to look at			2
they even put herbs up their noses when they have a cold , which does n't look so romantic			0
' but their beautiful garlands conceal a penchant for violence , which @entity21 became all too aware of when he attempted to step into a local restaurant for lunch			2
recovering : not all were for beauty			0
this man is wearing herbs in the hopes of dealing with a headache			0
he would use the same for colds decisions : not all of the men wear flower garlands , however			1
some , such as the man on the right , choose simple scarves instead proud : despite their colourful garlands , the tribe are proudly independent and have fought for centuries to keep control of their land conflict : many , such as this boy , can expect a future that sees them battle with encroaching tribes coming across the @entity4 border suspicious : as a result of that and bungled government intervention			1
the men are enormously suspicious of outsiders armed : all carry a ceremonial knife and as @entity21 discovered during his visit , they are not afraid to use them in charge : the villages are led by headsmen , usually elderly men such as this man			1
he has dyed his beard red to show devotion to @entity206 inside , he was threatened with knives by the flower men			2
' those guys are serious , ' he remembers			0
' the policemen kept telling me that they do n't play games and they were right			0
' for the first time in my life , i saw policemen with guns terrified of men with knifes			2
' and they had good reason			2
according to @entity221 , a @entity222 anthropologist who visited the tribe in the 1990s , the flower men even attempted to rape him			1
luckily for @entity21 , the men soon calmed down and he and his increasingly nervous police escort decided to leave			1
' the police got nervous after an hour , ' he explains			2
' nobody had stayed so long they asked me to leave			0
i know i was lucky to meet them			0
' and despite his hair - raising experience , @entity21 has some sympathy for the men who attacked him			2
' it is all down to a lack of contact with foreigners , ' he says			0
' they have also fought for centuries with other tribes who want to take their land			1
' their villages look like fortified castles with huge towers and walls , and they surround them with rocks for an extra line of defence			1
you can see that they have had to fight hard to keep their land			0
' unchanged : the tribe live in much the same way as their ancestors did			1
they have lived in the @entity117 for more than 2,000 years colourful : the streets of @entity84 , a village visited by @entity21 , were decorated with bright graphic patterns in red , blue and green detailed : the houses in @entity84 were decorated with elaborate chequered patterns while nearly all had balconies ( right ) fortress : the people of @entity84 have been forced to fight for their land and as a result , many of the homes look more like fortified castles protected : women are kept out of sight inside the houses			1
during his visit , @entity21 was only allowed to meet the men volatile : as their tower - like homes suggest , the men remain on guard and , at one point , threatened @entity21 with their knives remote : the stunning view of the @entity1 taken from @entity84 reveals just how remote the flower men 's home is			1

the tribe live in the foothills of the @entity1 in @entity3 's southern @entity15 *province*
men wear colourful floral garlands in a bid to look good and smell nice in the intense heat
despite their love of flowers , the tribes are notoriously violent and engage in cross-border battles
so dangerous are some of the tribes , the @entity3 police *refuse* to enter some of the villages
their villages are fortified with the tribesmen so far *resisting* all attempts to develop their land
