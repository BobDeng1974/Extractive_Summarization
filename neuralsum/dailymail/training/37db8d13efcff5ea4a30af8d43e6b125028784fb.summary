by @entity0 a newly - discovered lizard - like creature that lived more than 300 million years ago is believed to be the earliest known ancestor of plant - eating mammals			0
@entity5 , which measured less than eight inches long , marked a pivotal transition from carnivores to herbivores on the land			1
scientists showed that a partial skeleton of a juvenile specimen found in @entity13 , belonged to the caseid branch of a family of early mammal - like reptiles called synapsids			1
the @entity18 released this artist 's impression of the tiny mammal ancestor eocasea in the footprint of its much larger herbivorous descendent @entity24 although a carnivore feeding on insects , its larger descendants were herbivores			1
' @entity5 is one of the oldest relatives of modern mammals and closes a gap of about 20 million years to the next youngest members of the caseid family , ' said dr @entity35 , from @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38			2
' this shows that caseid synapsids were much more ancient than previously documented in the fossil record			0
' @entity43 colleague professor @entity42 , from the @entity18 , said : ' the evolution of herbivory was revolutionary to life on land because it meant terrestrial vertebrates could directly access the vast resources provided by terrestrial plants			0
scientists at the @entity18 showed that a partial skeleton of a juvenile specimen found in @entity13 ' these herbivores in turn became a major food resource for large land predators			1
' @entity5 is the first animal to start the process that has resulted in a terrestrial ecosystem with many plant eaters supporting fewer and fewer top predators			2
' the research is published in the online journal @entity65			0
it suggests plant - eating first evolved in the distant relatives of mammals some 30 million years before the ancestors of dinosaurs , birds , and modern reptiles adopted the same behaviour .			0

@entity5 marked transition from carnivores to herbivores
scientists showed a partial skeleton of a specimen found in @entity13
it was a carnivore feeding on insects , but its descendants were herbivores
