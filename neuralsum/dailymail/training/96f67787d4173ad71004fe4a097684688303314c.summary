by @entity0 last updated at 2:30 am on 4th august 2011 it 's the sort of luxurious yacht that would attract admiring glances wherever it went			2
in the case of £ 1million pleasure cruiser @entity7 , however , the attention it received was from customs officials , who found the @entity11 ’s largest ever haul of cocaine stashed ‘ ingeniously ’ inside			1
smugglers had hidden 1.2 tonnes of the class - a drug in the bodywork of the vessel – then audaciously tried to ship the whole boat to @entity11 in a commercial cargo vessel			1
high and dry : the @entity7 in @entity19 where she was searched by officers the cocaine was exceptionally pure and officials said it could have been cut into eight tons of saleable drugs – worth £ 300million and a third of the entire @entity11 annual supply			1
on tuesday , six suspected members of a crime gang , including a 60 - year - old @entity30 man and his three sons , were arrested in @entity32			2
police also seized 100,000 euros ( £ 87,300 ) , two @entity35 motorcycles , two guns , a silencer and ecstasy			0
authorities were first alerted to the 65ft @entity41 pleasure cruiser while it was in the @entity42 in may			0
seized : the £ 1m @entity7 , a 65ft pleasure cruiser , was held at @entity19 where @entity45 and @entity46 officers found cocaine worth an estimated £ 300m undercover officials looked on as it was loaded on to a container ship alongside 30 others for its journey across the @entity53 to @entity32 via @entity54			2
investigators believe the gang intended to unload the cocaine there before distributing the majority back to @entity11 , which is the biggest market for the drug in @entity62			1
but customs officers intercepted the boat at @entity54 and specialist search teams spent six days secretly taking it apart			0
meanwhile , the boat ’s owners threatened to sue for £ 750,000 unless it was released			0
border officials stalled for time claiming the yacht had been damaged in transit and was no longer seaworthy			0
record haul : the drugs , worth £ 300m , are pictured with the head of the @entity76 for the @entity45 @entity77 hidden depths : the £ 1million yacht , @entity7 , is held by customs officials , who found the 1.2 ton cocaine haul stashed in a specially built section in the back it transpired that the excuse was based on fact , as they discovered that by removing the huge haul of drugs the vessel had become dangerously unstable			1
the cocaine had been concealed in a specially designed four cubic - metre compartment under the diving platform			1
it was 90 per cent pure , while the average purity of cocaine seized at the @entity42 border is just 63 per cent			1
officials at the @entity46 said the high purity meant it could have been cut into about seven million street deals			1
@entity77 , of the @entity45 , said the way the drugs were hidden was ‘ ingenious ’ , adding : ‘ this has been an enormous seizure of cocaine			1
this is the largest we have on record			0
’ the operation is the latest blow to international drug cartels which has forced cocaine prices in the @entity11 to record levels			1
officials said the value of a kilo of cocaine has risen from £ 30,000 in 2008 to more than £ 55,000 today			2
news of the seizure came as @entity118 scored a separate blow against the @entity42 arm of another drug network			0
@entity122 and @entity123 , the final two members of a gang responsible for trafficking a ton of cocaine and laundering £ 10million , were jailed at @entity128			2
since the drugs were found in june , the @entity45 has helped @entity30 police track members of the gang and six men were arrested during early - morning raids on tuesday - two 44 - year - olds in @entity135 , a 60 - year - old in @entity137 , two , aged 32 and 34 , in @entity138 , and a 27 - year - old in @entity140			1
immigration minister @entity141 said : ' this was a significant drugs seizure which was made possible by the co-operation of our international partners			2
' @entity45 staff have shown vigilance , dedication and determination to uncover this shipment			0
' our efforts have helped bring an international crime gang to book and the message is clear : we will investigate and prosecute anyone who tries to smuggle banned substances through @entity11 borders			1
' by keeping the border secure we play a key role in stopping drugs entering the @entity11 and in reducing the harm they do to our communities			1
find : some of the 1.2 tonnes of 93 per cent pure cocaine found hidden inside the boat which was ' destroyed ' during the search @entity45 officials called the hiding of a record drugs haul in a 44 - tonne , £ 1 million luxury yacht ' ingenious '			1
' the cocaine took up a space of about four cubic metres and was fitted neatly under the diving platform aft with access from the engine room			2
' it required some really good blanking panels to hide them and it was ingenious , ' a spokesman said			0
the hiding place was so good it took specially trained officers six days to find the haul			1
' the concealment was a professional job			0
it 's a case of being methodical to find it , ' said @entity189 , the head of maritime operations at the @entity45			1
' six days might sound like a long time but there is a lot of areas on a yacht of this size , so it 's a painstaking process using trained officers , firstly looking through the obvious places and when those have been exhausted looking at the fabric of the boat			2
' the yacht had been transported from the @entity42 on board a specially designed @entity30 - registered ship , @entity202 , owned by @entity203 along with 30 others			2
it was coming to @entity62 to be refitted			0
the transport company was completely unaware of the drugs , the spokesman said			2
now the yacht , which was owned by those arrested , is at berth in @entity54 docks and is crown property			0
' we aim to protect society from the violence and corruption that always accompanied the trade in illegal goods			0
' the @entity30 police were acting on intelligence provided by @entity46 's international network and the @entity224 @entity223			0
@entity77 said the international co-operation was a ' strong and powerful example of more to come ' , he said			0
asked about how the drugs were hidden , he added : ' it was ingenious , it was difficult to find			1
skilful people spent a number of days looking for it			0
' @entity233 , deputy director of international operations for @entity46 , said the @entity7 had been ' of interest for some time '			0
@entity236 showed the trust between international partners as the £ 1 million vessel was ' destroyed to find the load ' , he said			0
he said the high purity of the cocaine meant it would make about eight tonnes of saleable drugs once cut			1
' it 's unusual for a load like that to get to the shores of the @entity11			1
' it is undoubtedly the case that , had this vessel been allowed to get to its destination , a significant amount of this load would have been transported back to the @entity11			1
' @entity253 , deputy director for the @entity45 's crime directorate , said the drugs were destined for @entity32 , from where they would have been distributed across @entity62			1
commissioner @entity257 , of the @entity258 , said all six arrested men were @entity30 nationals			0
they included the 60 - year - old owner of the boat and his three sons , aged 27 , 32 and 34			0
a further arrest of a seventh @entity30 national is also expected , he said			0
ripped apart : officers made the search after tracking the boat from the @entity41 which was bound for @entity32			0

@entity11 's ' biggest - ever ' find of @entity270 drugs *weighing* 1.2 tonnes
haul of 93 per cent pure cocaine represents a third of annual street deals when cut and distributed
