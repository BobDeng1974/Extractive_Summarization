but a new photo series by the @entity6 reveals just how different 2,000 calories can look at @entity9 's favorite food chains			1
in fact , in some cases just a single dish is enough to meet that quota			0
at the @entity16 , for instance , the @entity14 clocks in at 2,370 calories - no drinks or sides required			1

@entity68 ? a @entity69 with cheese gets you halfway there at 1,070 calories			2
onion rings ( 410 calories ) and a vanilla milkshake ( 550 calories ) complete the feast			2
