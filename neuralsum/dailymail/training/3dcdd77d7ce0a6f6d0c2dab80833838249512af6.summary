one of @entity1 ’s biggest family house builders is moving into the retirement market to cater for the @entity1 ’s rapidly aging population			2
@entity4 - the firm that has epitomised property - owning @entity1 got the last three decades - is changing the way it designs and builds homes to try and tempt older homeowners			1
the company typically builds four - bedroom homes aimed at young families			1
it is now going to offer homes designed with a larger master suite and two more flexible bedrooms or studies			1
at the same time , one of the largest specialist builders of sheltered accomodation and retirement homes , @entity25 , is also launching a ‘ lifestyle range ’ aimed at the over- 55s - yet to retire but looking at more convenient , smaller accomodation			1
homes in @entity1 are increasingly owned by older generations			2
three - quarters of people aged 60 and over own their own home , whereas less than a third of those aged 25 to 34 do , according to the @entity38			1
and the younger group struggling to get a foot on the property ladder is forecast to grow by just 5 per cent over the next 20 years , while the number of those 60 and over in the @entity1 is expected to double to 21m			0
@entity4 is the first mainstream @entity1 house builder to move into the retirement market			1
the over- 55s housing market in @entity1 is dominated by a handful of specialist providers			1
however , these usually cater for the more elderly and infirm and there is not many alternatives for healthy people			0
a retirement flat in @entity55 , built by @entity25 - one of the largest specialist builders of sheltered accomodation and retirement homes @entity60 , @entity4 chief executive , told the @entity61 : ‘ there is a growing segment of non-mortgage - constrained affluent downsizers – people who do n’t need a mortgage in order to move house			1
‘ but if they thought for one minute you were trying to sell them retirement housing they would run a mile			0
they are not aged and infirm , they ’re likely to be fit and active			2
they are not elderly , they ’ve got full lives			0
’ the government has been trying to encourage downsizing to free up family homes but progress has been slow because of a lack of appealing alternatives for the over- 55s			1
while some homeowners are lucky enough to be mortgage free , or have plans to downsize from a larger property , many people in their 50s will still have a mortgage			2
and with mortgage rates near record lows , it could be a good time to remortgage and reduce the cost of paying off your home before retirement - and even save the extra money into a pension if you want to			1
