by @entity0 published : 14:48 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 14:48 est , 7 july 2013 breakthrough : scientists have developed a way of tracking tumours which have absorbed glucose chocolate , fizzy drinks and other sugar - laden foods could soon be used to detect cancer			1
scientists have developed a technique that identifies the disease by tracking how sugar is absorbed by the body			1
malignant tumours consume much more glucose – a simple sugar – than healthy tissues in order to feed their rapid growth			1
by adjusting an mri scanner to look for glucose uptake , researchers at @entity23 discovered tumours glowed brightly during imaging , after something sweet had been consumed			1
the breakthrough provides a safer and simpler alternative to standard radioactive techniques , and could be available in as little as 18 months			2
due to the need for radiation , the current method of scanning is not recommended for pregnant women and children , and only available at a limited number of larger hospitals and specialist centres			2
in contrast , @entity42 facilities are commonplace , meaning less travel for patients			1
and as there are no adverse effects from the technique , it can be used on a frequent basis to track whether a cancer is responding to therapy and tailor a patient ’s treatment			0
as well as being cheaper and safer , the new method also raises hopes of improved survival rates			0
senior author professor @entity58 , director of @entity23 ’s @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , said the results had been unexpected			0
he said : ‘ i certainly did n’t believe it as possible to fine tune an mri scanner to pick up glucose movement even 18 months ago			1
but our research proves it can be done			0
‘ it can be done after consuming a sweet drink , like a cola or a fruit juice , or food			0
we can detect cancer using the same sugar content found in half a standard sized chocolate bar			0
’ in the study , published in the journal @entity78 , the team tracked tumours in mice with bowel cancer			1
they found the cancerous growth was detectable by an mri scanner following glucose ingestion			1
the method has also been trialled on a handful of cancer patients with early signs of success			0
he said : ‘ it was promising			0
you could see the uptake of the glucose in the area around the tumour			1
’ unlike the current method of scanning , known as positron emission tomography ( @entity102 ) , which requires a trace amount of a radioactive substance to be injected into a patient , the new technique is needle free			0
‘ effectively you do n’t even have to give a patient an injection , as sugary food is absorbed so quickly , so it will be good news for those who do n’t like needles , ’ said professor @entity58			0
alternative : mri scans are a safer and simpler method of detecting tumours than standard radioactive techniques he added : ‘ as for @entity102 , there is always a small risk associated with anything involving radioactivity			1
so it can only be used sparingly , and is not suitable for pregnant women or children			0
‘ too much radiation can damage dna , and can either result in cell deaths or some cellular damage which can lead to secondary cancerous growths			0
‘ but with glucose scanning , there are no adverse effects , so it can be carried out much more often			1
if a doctor wants to follow up how a cancer is responding to treatment then they can scan the tumour on a weekly , or even a daily basis			2
’ lead researcher dr @entity140 , also from @entity59 , said the newly - developed technique used radio waves to magnetically label glucose in the body			2
‘ this can then be detected in tumours using conventional @entity42 techniques , ’ he said			1
‘ it could offer a cheap , safe alternative to existing methods for detecting tumours , which require the injection of radioactive material			2
’ clinical trials are now taking place , said professor @entity58 , who added : ‘ we do n’t have to refine the technique , as it stands it works			0
in a year ’s time , we will be able to see hospitals picking it up			0
’ dr @entity161 , @entity162 ’s science communications manager , said : ‘ researchers have known for many years that cancer cells produce energy and use sugar slightly differently from healthy cells			2
‘ this exciting experimental scanning technique , suggests that regular , non-radioactive glucose can be used to detect bowel tumours in mice			1
it ’s got the potential to become a safer , cheaper way of diagnosing and monitoring cancer , so the next step is to test it in patients – using controlled doses of pure glucose rather than sweets or chocolate - to see how well it works in the clinic			2

malignant tumours consume more glucose than healthy tissues
scientists can scan for glucose uptake using @entity42 to identify tumours
