things are going @entity2 ’s way			1
as if scoring two tries and claiming the man - of - match award against @entity5 was n’t enough , the @entity6 8 topped things off by being named @entity9 player of the autumn series — all just days after beating five - time world champion @entity11 at darts			1
this time last year , things were not going @entity2 ’s way			1
deeply frustrated by @entity19 ’s woeful form under ex-coach @entity20 , his @entity17 form deserted him and he slipped down the international pecking order as a result			2
@entity6 no 8 @entity2 scores opening try against @entity5 at @entity25 but the past 12 months have seen a remarkable turnaround for the former 20 - stone plumber			1
‘ it ’s been a pretty special few weeks , ’ @entity2 said on thursday , just minutes after being named @entity9 player of the series			1
‘ i definitely was n’t expecting it			2
it ’s a great accolade to have			2
‘ personally i feel worlds apart from last season			2
i was n’t in a good place mentally and 100 per cent it was getting me down			2
i lost all my confidence			2
i have to be playing and enjoying myself			2
that ’s where my confidence comes from			2
i did n’t have any of it			0
‘ but having stuck it out and come through it will really help when i face more tough times			0
we now have a new set - up at @entity19 ( with @entity47 installed as director of rugby ) with new players and new coaches , i feel really , really good			1
@entity2 with darts greats @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity11 ‘ i ’m enjoying my rugby again and i think that ’s been reflected in how i ’ve been playing in the last few games			1
i ’ve signed off the autumn happy			1
’ he is even happier following his remarkable defeat of @entity11 in front of a stunned crowd at a darts event staged at @entity62 last week			1
‘ whatever sport i play i want to win , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ i had n’t played darts for a while			0
i was nervous on the oche but i backed myself			0
you do n’t go up there to lose ! i hit a 140 and then @entity11 missed check - out on 81			2
i won with double four ! ’ @entity70 - born forward @entity2 was named @entity9 player of the autumn series happy , relaxed and enjoying his time at the top of his sport , it could all have been very different for the @entity70 - born no 8			1
four years ago when @entity2 turned down an invitation from @entity78 to play for @entity79 he thought he ’d blown his international future			1
barely three years after being made redundant as an apprentice plumber who used to gorge on entire chickens for lunch , @entity2 had moved to @entity84 , turned professional , slimmed down and was attracting attention on both sides of the @entity87			1
days before qualifying for @entity84 on residency grounds , @entity2 received a call from the former @entity91 - winning captain turned @entity6 head coach			1
‘ @entity78 left a message on my answer phone , i was absolutely awestruck , ’ said @entity2 , who had secured a £ 5,000 contract with @entity95 minnows @entity96 in 2008 before signing for the @entity97 a year later			1
‘ but that was the first i ’d heard that @entity6 were even looking at me			0
i was carrying a couple of knocks as well and i did n’t want to go up there and not be 100 per cent			0
i was a young lad , panicking that if i did n’t impress i ’d regret it for ever			0
@entity2 is happy , relaxed and enjoying his time at the top of his sport ‘ i was so nervous making that call			1
saying no to @entity78 ? who would n’t be ? i was absolutely dreading it			0
‘ he was really good about it but it was a huge call and i was worried that i ’d blown my whole future			0
’ now with 27 caps to his name , the 25 - year - old is starting to look the part at @entity119			2
barring injury or an unexpected loss of form , he looks sure to start @entity6 ’s opening @entity124 clash against @entity84 in @entity126 on february 6 ahead of @entity127			0
but it took an intervention from @entity130 after @entity78 ’s departure in 2011 to convince @entity2 he should throw his lot in with @entity6			1
‘ i ’d always wanted to play for @entity6 , i ’d never considered playing for another country growing up , ’ he said			0
‘ just talking with @entity130 about how he saw things gave me confidence i was being watched			0
it was a reassuring meeting			0
’ firmly established in @entity130 ’s squad , the work @entity2 has done in order to lose around 18 kilograms is paying dividends			1
‘ when i first started at @entity97 i weighed 132.5 kilos			0
i was a big lad			0
the first year was just about trying to get me in shape			0
‘ when i worked on the building site we would go for a greasy fry up every friday			0
i ’d go for lunch and buy a @entity148 stick , split it open and stick a chicken in it ‘ a whole chicken			0
i think about it now and think what the hell was i doing ? i know so much more about my body now and how to take care of myself			0
’ with a @entity91 pending , @entity6 ’s fans will hope things continue to go @entity2 ’s way			1
@entity2 is a @entity161 and always wears kit from the authentic brand , built to meet the demands of the professional game			1
