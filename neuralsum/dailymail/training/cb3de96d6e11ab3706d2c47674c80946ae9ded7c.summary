by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 8 february 2013 it was only in august that iconic luxury department store @entity2 opened the doors to its much - hyped gender - neutral toy department			1
the multi-million pound re-design of the 15 year - old department was the famous store 's way of entering the new era with a @entity10 being grouped by theme and not gender			1
however , @entity2 is currently at the centre of a @entity15 storm after one user uploaded a photo suggesting that the store has n't completely revoked gender marketing			1
juxtaposition : @entity21 uploaded this photo from the ' gender neutral ' section of @entity2 ' @entity10 and expressed her shock @entity25 , a tv freelance journalist and researcher from @entity27 , posted an image on @entity15 of two children 's books placed next to each other in the department store			1
on the left , a book entitled : ' how to be gorgeous : smart ways to look and feel fabulous ' features a girl on the cover and on the right a book illustrated with a young boy says : ' how to be clever : smart ways to get smarter '			0
the self - proclaimed ' opinionated feminist ' told @entity42 : ' yesterday evening i was looking in the impressive new gender - neutral section of @entity2 and two books caught my eye			1
' it was the juxtaposition of the two books on the shelf that struck me			0
' @entity25 uploaded a photo of the books with the caption : ' shocked and appalled at this in @ harrods children 's reading room			2
please rt to get these sexist books off the shelf			0

please rt to get these sexist books off the shelf ' ' thank god little girls can learn " how to look stylish in five minutes flat " whilst boys learn " incredible ways to remember things " @ harrods ' she also added : ' smart one should n't be removed - it just should n't only have a boy on the front cover '			2
@entity25 , who has worked on feminist issues in the past , immediately approached a member of the sales team who admitted she was equally ' appalled ' and put her in contact with the manager			0
' the manager was embarrassed and blamed @entity88 as the books were part of their concession there			0
' i did n't want to complain again but there were more books next to them of a similar nature			0
one for girls had tips on how to change bed sheets , which 12 - year - old girl wants to change bedsheets ? ' said @entity25			2
hours after 25 - year - old @entity25 posted her photo , more than 400 people had retweeted her request to get the books removed from shelves			1
non gender neutral : hours after 25 - year - old @entity25 posted her photo , more than 400 people had retweeted her request to get the books removed from shelves this morning , @entity2 tweeted saying : ' @entity109 ! please be advised that the children 's books that many of you have tweeted us about have been removed from our shelves ... ' they then added : ' we would like to apologise for any offence caused and assure you all that these books will no longer be sold at # @entity2			1
' @entity25 , who used to work at the department store , says she was n't surprised by the public support she gained because she believes that it is an issue that strikes a nerve with many			2
