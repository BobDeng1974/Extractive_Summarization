’ miss @entity36 said : ‘ but when you told the jury with such confidence last week on tuesday that you had never been to @entity8 until four years ago , that was a deliberate lie , was n't it ? ’ he replied : ‘ no , it was n't			1

’ the veteran told jurors : ‘ i had no idea			0
i do n't think any of us knew			0
’ miss @entity36 asked : ‘ nobody knew they were in @entity8 ? ’ @entity1 replied : ‘ none of the performers , none of the stars knew			1

miss @entity36 told @entity1 , who denies the assault : ‘ the footage shows you monkeying around pretending to be an animal – all of which fits the description [ the alleged victim ] said she saw prior to being assaulted by you			2
