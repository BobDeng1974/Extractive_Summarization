we could n't guess what the outcome was going to be at that time			0
' superintendent @entity137 said : ' it was reported by an off duty police officer and friend of the family - that negated the immediacy			1
gunman : @entity4 shot pc @entity4 while on the run in july 2010 ' for me there was no immediacy around this situation			1
this is because mrs @entity89 did not know if these threats were real and the information was incomplete			0
