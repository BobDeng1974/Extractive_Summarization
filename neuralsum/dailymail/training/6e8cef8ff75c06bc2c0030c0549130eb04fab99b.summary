designers from @entity1 to ghost have sent dresses reminiscent of nightwear down the catwalk , and some stars have even worn nighties out on the town			1
so was @entity9 presenter @entity9 , 45 , able to tell dress from nightie ? 1			1
this must be a dress — it has lining , a zip and smoothed over all my lumps and bumps			1
it was comfortable and i would happily wear it to dinner with a simple three - quarter - length jacket			1
when i found it was a nightie , i was shocked			2
i ’d feel very overdressed if i wore this in bed			2

a nightie if ever i saw one ! i would n’t be brave enough to wear it out and about , because the colour is so unforgiving			1
the cut would only work for the very brave : one twirl on the dancefloor and everyone would see every bit of my tummy			0
so imagine my surprise when i discovered it was actually a dress ! dress , £ 165 , @entity42 ; heels , £ 17.99 , newlook.co.uk ; topaz earrings , £ 98 , dowerandhall.com 3			1
i knew this was a dress from the start			1
it felt secure , comfortable and i ’d happily go out for a meal in it			0
it ’s not my usual style , but is surprisingly flattering			0
also , unlike a real nightie , which is usually lighter and gathers around all the bits you do n’t want it to , this is weighty so hangs off my curves well			0
dress , £ 195 , and earrings , £ 12 , both coast - @entity62 4			1
although i suspected this is a nightie , it ’s far too pretty to go to bed in ! i love the colour , the fit and the shawl back , and it slims in all the right places			0
i felt a little bit exposed , though , and i ’m really not sure i ’d be confident enough to wear it in public			1
it ’s elegant and looks like a dress from the back			1
with the right underwear , it could look lovely			0
@entity80 chemise , £ 95 , figleaves.com ; glitter heels , £ 195 , lucychoilondon.com 5			0
i expected to be surprised by this one , but due to the lining i decided it was almost certainly a dress — and i was right			2
it felt very soft and the material was gorgeous — it also had lots of movement , which i love			0
and , unlike the others , i would n’t need a bra , thanks to its internal boning			0
this was my second favourite : i felt dressed - up and sophisticated			2
dress , £ 225 , ghost.co.uk			2
