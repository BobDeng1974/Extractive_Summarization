by @entity0 published : 15:18 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 01:16 est , 8 october 2013 @entity2 tribes have been caught misappropriating tens of millions of taxpayer dollars , according to internal tribal audits and other documents			1
but federal authorities do little about it , due to a lack of oversight , resources or political will , causing poor tribes like the @entity13 of @entity14 to suffer			1
one @entity13 manager pocketed money meant to buy meals for tribal elders			1
another used funds from the reservation 's diabetes program to subsidize personal shopping trips			0
altogether , employees drained at least a half - million dollars from the coffers of a tribe whose members have a median household income of about $ 16,000 a year			1
federal agencies questioned millions more dollars the @entity13 government spent , but decided not to recover any of the money — and even increased funding to the tribe			1
the @entity14 tribe is hardly unique			1
an @entity0 review of summaries of audits shows that serious concerns were consistently raised about 124 of 551 tribal governments , schools or housing authorities that received at least 10 years of substantial federal funds since 1997			1
fraud and theft occur across the range of nonprofits and local governments that get federal money			1
but tribes are five times as likely as other recipients of federal funds to have ' material weaknesses ' that create an opportunity for abuses , according to the review			2
@entity13 tribal liaison @entity66 speaks with a colleague during a break of an inter-tribal meeting in @entity14 overall , one in four audits concluded that tribal governments , schools or housing authorities had a material weakness in their federally funded programs ; the rate was one in 20 for nontribal programs			1
thousands of pages of audits and dozens of reports by federal investigators , obtained by the @entity0 under the @entity83 , show evidence of embezzlement , paychecks for do - nothing jobs , and employees who over-billed hours and expenses			2
the audits , conducted by private firms , are required of tribes that spend more than $ 500,000 in federal funds annually			2
agencies often can not legally cut funding because of treaties , @entity98 decisions and acts of @entity100 , and frequently refuse to take control of failing programs			0
' it 's basically a reluctance to take on tribes			0
the @entity106 bends over backwards to be their friends , ' said @entity108 , the former inspector general at the department that houses the bureaus of @entity111 and @entity112			0
' it 's ' make nice , ' and what you do n't know , you do n't know			0
' many amounts were relatively small			0
but there are so many instances of abuses that the total was substantial			0
tribal council members in @entity122 used federal grants to pay their utility bills and mortgages			1
a @entity127 tribe spent health clinic money on horses and @entity130			1
an environmental supervisor with a @entity133 tribe received $ 16,000 for mileage and other charges he either exaggerated or never incurred			2
among grant programs with a significant track record in a government database of audits , tribes ran 16 of the 20 with the highest rates of rule - breaking			0
auditors flagged welfare grants to tribes , for example , 39 per cent of the time			2
@entity148 , a @entity13 member and diversity cooridantor at @entity150 listens during the inter-tribal meeting in @entity152 , @entity14 most prominent were programs funded by @entity106 's bureaus of @entity111 and @entity112 and the @entity155 , under the @entity156			1
many findings by auditors suggest mismanagement , not theft or fraud			0
one barrier to proper administration of tribal programs is turnover among staff and leaders — entire governments can be voted out of office every two years			2
attracting qualified administrators to often - remote reservations in the first place is another challenge			0
' so they hire maybe the chairman 's nephew who had some accounting classes , ' said @entity178 , a longtime auditor of tribal books			2
@entity148 , a @entity13 member who is diversity coordinator at @entity150 in @entity152 , said tribes generally are just finding their self - governance footing after years of being under federal control			1
he said there are four goals for a successful tribal government — ' academic preparation , professional experience , a collective consensus for the benefit of the tribe and an ethical set of guidelines			1
' @entity148 , who also teaches a class about the tribe on the reservation , said it is relatively easy to address each point individually			2
but all four must be done together , and that 's not easy , he added			0
' it 's not just our reservation ; this is commonplace with a lot of tribes			0
' this photo shows @entity208 , @entity14 , government seat of the @entity13 tribe on the @entity27 - the tribe received one of the worst possible ratings on audits there are about 10,000 enrolled members of the @entity13 , which shares a large reservation southeast of @entity217			1
for the most part , they live in trailers , lapped siding homes and farm houses scratched into the high plains at the foot of the @entity224			0
officials at the @entity226 , which governs the tribe , contended in a statement that numerous negative audits the tribe received were ' primarily a result of inadequate documentation and record - keeping			2
' the statement added that the management issues ' were many years in the making and will take time and considerable financial resources to fix			0
' the business council has ordered a ' top to bottom review of all programs , both tribal and federal , to determine if improper spending is taking place and if personnel changes are required			1
' @entity66 , a former chairman of the business council who serves as the @entity13 liaison with the state , said the tribe participates in more than 60 federal programs , a number that presents challenges for auditing and accountability			1
' there 's nothing really intentional , ' he said of any shortcomings			0
since the early 1970s , federal policy has favored letting tribes manage housing , health , welfare , law enforcement and other programs as they see fit			1
as this ' self - determination ' approach took hold , many tribes developed the financial savvy and governmental infrastructure to handle millions in federal money without major incident			1
but others , like the @entity13 , have not			1
federal officials try to coach tribes to self - correct rather than punish them , both in deference to tribal ' self - determination ' and because there are n't enough staff to closely monitor the thousands of service contracts between tribes and the government			1
even when auditors raise concerns , there is no guarantee that tribal leaders will be investigated or prosecuted			2
several auditors said their contracts were not renewed after they uncovered self - enrichment by tribal leaders			2
indeed , agencies recoup a small fraction of what they conclude tribes owe			0
since fiscal year 2008 , the @entity111 and the @entity295 have collected only $ 2.3 million of nearly $ 69 million in questionable expenditures , according to financial records			0
in several cases , the bureaus were legally barred from recouping money because they waited too long			2
since 2003 , auditors concluded that 79 tribes or @entity2 organizations could n't justify $ 33 million of @entity305 money they spent			1
@entity305 said it had recouped ' approximately $ 3 million ' since october 2007			0
@entity111 and @entity112 ca n't legally reduce funding even to corrupt governments			0
funding levels are set by federal law , regardless of how well a tribe is managed			1
@entity312 , a senior budget official at @entity111 , said reducing funding based on past practices would penalize tribal members rather than address management issues			1
the standard punishment is requiring tribes to submit invoices for reimbursement , rather than giving full funding at the start of each year			0
agencies can in theory wrest programs back from tribes , but almost never do			0
in 2012 , for example , @entity111 had taken back the programs of three of 566 federally recognized tribes			0
' they do n't want to take the program back ; ' said @entity330 , a @entity111 employee for 30 years who retired as its director			0
' they want the tribe to succeed			0
