@entity3 is a hardline @entity4 group and part of the @entity17 alliance that has been in armed conflict with @entity19 , also known as the @entity20 , and the regime of @entity22			1
' we do n't know the cause of the explosion yet , ' @entity53 , a member of @entity3 's politburo told @entity55 in an interview			1

however , a statement released by the group said the leaders had ' died through a car bomb '			1

the @entity85 , the monitoring group , said some 50 of the group 's leaders had been gathered at a house when the blast went off			1
@entity90 , who runs the @entity85 , said the blast had occurred inside the meeting			1
@entity3 , which is widely believed to have received funding from @entity94 , aims to implement @entity17 sharia law in @entity5			1
it was at one point considered the strongest insurgent group in the @entity5 civil war			2
its views are more moderate than @entity19			1
in june @entity25 condemned @entity19 in an interview with the @entity101			1
he said : ' @entity19 does not reflect @entity102 in any way			1
@entity102 is a religion of peace			0
it is not a religion of slaughter			0
@entity19 represents the worst image ever of @entity102			2
' @entity5 state tv flashed an urgent news headline reporting @entity25 's death			0
@entity5 descended into civil war after an uprising against president @entity22 's rule in 2011			2
the @entity116 recently put the death toll above 191,000 people			0
in january another senior @entity3 leader , @entity119 , was killed in a suicide attack			1
@entity119 had fought alongside @entity122 founder @entity121 and was close to its current chief @entity123			0
@entity123 recently announced that @entity122 has expanded into the @entity126 subcontinent			0
he said in a video statement that a regional group had been formed that he vowed would bring @entity17 law to the region and ' wage jihad against its enemies			0
' some analysts saw the announcement , which showed @entity123 speaking in front of a dark curtain , as an effort to revive the fortunes of @entity122 , which has been largely eclipsed , at least publicly , by the @entity20			0

@entity19 was kicked out of @entity122 in february for ignoring @entity123 ’s insistence that it restrict its activities to @entity153 ’s borders			2
the separation , however , far from diminishing the group , marked the start of its terrifying expansion			0
over the past few months it has rampaged across @entity153 and @entity5 , capturing dozens of towns and strategic positions , killing hundreds of civilians and waging a well - organised online propaganda war			0
its ranks have been bolstered by hundreds of fighters from @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity169 nations such as @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172			0
@entity122 has been side - lined as a result , jihadists seemingly far more impressed by @entity19 ’ leader @entity174 and his brutal confrontations with those people deemed to be ‘ un-islamic ’ than @entity123 , who has n’t been able to dictate events in recent years			2
however , the @entity179 ignores @entity122 at its peril			0
the terrorist organisation still has strongholds in eastern @entity166 , @entity5 and the @entity183 in @entity184 and has significant alliances with the likes of the @entity187 in @entity188 .			0
