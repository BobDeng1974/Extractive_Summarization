@entity0 today warned @entity1 to stop ' scaremongering ' that deliveries which allow letters to be sent anywhere in the country for the same price are under threat			1
the business secretary said the firm - part - owned by the taxpayer - must stop ' whinging ' about competition from rival companies ' cherry - picking ' the delivery of letters and parcels in high density areas			1
it comes after @entity17 , @entity1 's chief executive , told @entity18 that the ' precious ' universal service obligation is under threat with competitors undermining her firm 's economics			1
@entity1 profits fell from £ 353 million to £ 279 million			2
the universal service obligation ( @entity36 ) cost £ 7.2 billion a year because of the high cost of delivering post to rural and remote areas of the @entity40			1
giving evidence to the business select committee today , ms @entity17 said : ' the universal service is a precious service			1
it its essential for most people in @entity40 and it has a fixed cost			0
' it requires a number of internal subsidies in order to make the economics work			0
' so for example , the low cost urban areas are needed - and mail that 's high density and high volume mail are needed - to cross-subsidise the suburban and rural areas which are much higher cost			1
' if you allow cherry - picking in urban areas you undermine the economics			1
it siphons off very quickly a lot of revenue			0
it makes the universal service uneconomic			1
' ' unlike many universal services in the world , we do not require or rely on government subsidy			2
' she insisted the firm has made ' great strides ' in making efficiencies			0
@entity1 was part privatised last year in a controversial sell - off which critics claimed saw shares bought on the cheap			2
today mr @entity0 insisted the competition in the postal market was known at the time of the flotation and @entity1 should stop suggesting the universal service was in jeopardy			1
he told it news : ' it is scaremongering			0
there is no prospect of the universal service obligation being removed			1
' the truth of the matter is the @entity1 is operating in a very competitive market			2
' we knew that when we brought in private ownership			0
it was very clear to anybody that bought shares that they were operating in this very competitive market			0
' and we do n't want frankly people whinging about it			0
they have got to compete			0
' @entity1 needs the high volume , low cost work delivering letters in built - up areas to subsidise the cost of services in rural areas @entity1 has lost 50,000 staff in the last decade , and is shedding 2 - 3,000 jobs a year , she added			1
letter deliveries are falling by around 4 - 6 per cent a year and competitors taking business off the @entity1 in urban areas was making the @entity36 ' uneconomic ' , she said			1
officials from competitors @entity119 and @entity121 denied they were cherry picking work , or that they threatened the universal service			1
but the @entity125 union warned : ' the postal service is a bit like the @entity128 ( @entity128 )			0
we want the assurance that it is there if we need it			0
' however competitors to the @entity1 are again like the privateers in the @entity128			2
' they are happy to do the ingrowing toe nails and the tonsil removal operation but , not to do those that require high cost / low return after care or expensive drug treatments			0
' @entity142 , deputy general secretary of the @entity143 ( @entity143 ) , told the @entity18 : ' the sustainability of the @entity36 faces its greatest threat			1
' as well as competition , postal workers were delivering to more and more addresses , while the number of letters was declining , he said			0
mr @entity142 added that unions could not understand why the regulator @entity153 was still to decide if it will bring forward a review of the @entity36 from next year			0
@entity143 general secretary @entity155 said he wanted @entity1 's competitors to publish their employees ' pay and conditions so there was transparency across the industry			2
as the @entity40 's ' universal service ' provider , @entity1 is required to provide access to competitors such as @entity167 for final mile deliveries			1
postal regulator @entity153 is investigating a complaint from @entity167 over @entity1 's decision to change conditions and increase the prices it charges to deliver post collected and pre-sorted by its competitors			2
@entity178 's shadow trade minister @entity177 said : ' this stark warning from the chief executive of @entity1 will be deeply worrying for the millions of consumers and small businesses who rely on @entity1 's six - day delivery and essential services			2
' @entity178 warned that @entity187 's @entity1 fire sale would put vital services at risk , and @entity17 's evidence today has confirmed our worst fears			1
it comes after taxpayers were short changed by hundreds of millions of pounds by the botched sale			0
' ministers urgently need to clarify what action they will take to secure the future of postal services following the mess created by their botched fire sale			0

business secretary hits back at claims universal service is in jeopardy
@entity17 tells @entity18 urgent action is need to *protect* services
@entity1 relies on deliveries in urban areas to subside rural services
fears rival firms are taking the easy , profitable work in towns and cities
