the first official analysis of the government ’s shake - up two years ago warns that desirable areas have become a ‘ battleground ’ between councils and landowners			2
in a report published today , mps say the new rules are allowing housing to be ‘ imposed on some communities ’ by developers using legal loopholes to override local opposition			1
presumption in favour of development ... the first official analysis of the government ’s shake - up two years ago warns that desirable areas have become a ‘ battleground ’ between councils and landowners			2
file picture the @entity25 , introduced in march 2012 , encouraged councils to earmark suitable land to meet demand for housing over the next five years			2
most contentiously , councils were also ordered to have a ‘ presumption ’ in favour of development , to meet the demand for housing from a growing population			0
but the @entity34 warns that developers are exploiting this provision to secure prime greenfield land			1
when council planners try to veto an application , developers are able to use the guidelines as a ‘ stick with which to beat them ’ , the report says			2
it concluded : ‘ our report has identified a number of issues with the operation of the @entity25 : that it is not preventing unsustainable development ; that it is leading to communities being subject to inappropriate and unwanted housing development ; and that it is giving insufficient protection to @entity54 ’s town centres			0
’ campaigners have raised concerns about the new planning rules since they were brought in , saying they have led to a free - for - all for developers			1
former @entity59 minister @entity58 , the mp for @entity60 and the @entity61 , last year denounced the @entity62 as an ‘ environmental disaster ’			0
and earlier this year campaigners claimed that planning permission had been given on appeal for a staggering 27,000 houses on greenfield sites turned down by councils , in the last two years			0
in today ’s report ‘ @entity74 ’ , the committee which reviewed 300 pieces of written evidence and interviewed 40 witnesses , agreed there were serious concerns about the reforms			0
parish councils said they felt ‘ under siege ’ and that permission was being given for homes with no thought to the impact on ‘ local infrastructure such as schools , health care , transport and sewerage ’			0
ministers were urged to close a loophole which allows developers to build on land which the council has not included in its ‘ local plan ’ – the area the local authority has designated for new homes			1
@entity98 : earlier this year campaigners claimed that planning permission had been given on appeal for a staggering 27,000 houses on greenfield sites turned down by councils , in the last two years			0
file picture the @entity105 heard that developers would reject the sites they had been offered , and then issue new planning applications to try to secure more desirable plots on the edges of towns and villages			1
@entity114 chair @entity113 , a @entity115 mp , said : ‘ we heard developers were claiming sites were unviable in order to obtain planning permission on other , more lucrative sites against the wishes of the council and communities			0
’ the reasons they gave for the land being unviable could be ‘ unreliable ’ or in some cases the developers refused to reveal them due to ‘ commercial confidentiality ’ , mps were told			1
the report said : ‘ we are concerned that the question of viability of becoming a battleground between developers and local authorities			1
‘ there is a perception amongst councils that developers are using the @entity25 provisions as a stick with which to beat them … and getting more greenfield sites added to the land supply ’			1
mps said they had decided against ordering ministers to ‘ tear up ’ the planning guidance and start again but fundamental changes were needed to ‘ ensure it does the job it was intended to do ’			0
mr @entity113 suggested that when land for new housing is chosen ‘ the same weight needs to be given to environmental and social factors as to the economic dimension ’			0
they also called for the government to scrap the rules which make it easier to turn former shops into homes as they are ‘ making the town centre an unattractive place to visit or indeed to live ’ .			2
