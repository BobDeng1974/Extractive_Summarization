the number of eggs a woman has may not just indicate her fertility , but overall life expectancy women who go through an early menopause may be ageing faster generally , scientists have discovered			1
they say the number of eggs a woman has may not just indicate her fertility , but overall life expectancy			1
specifically , it may predict the risk of a heart attack , @entity10 reports			0
a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have and the number declines with age			0
previous research has suggested the average woman is born with 300,000 potential egg cells			0
going through the menopause anywhere between 45 and 55 is considered the norm , while experiencing it before the age of 40 is known as a premature menopause			0
a study from the @entity26 found women who go through an early menopause run twice the risk of a heart attack or stroke in later life			1
a possible explanation is the reduction in a woman 's natural supply of oestrogen at a much earlier stage of life than would normally occur at the menopause			1
the ovaries make the hormone oestrogen , the hormone that regulates a woman 's periods			1
so when the ovaries stop functioning , the level of oestrogen drops			0
however oestrogen also has a protective effect on the heart - so after the menopause , the risk of heart disease increases			1
post-menopausal women often experience weight gain , particularly around the abdomen , which can contribute to poor health			0
the new study , presented at the annual meeting of the @entity59 in @entity60 , takes this ageing concept a step further			0
the researchers investigated whether women who have early menopause are ageing faster generally			1
' perhaps women who go through menopause early are intrinsically ageing at a different rate , ' lead researcher professor @entity70 , of the @entity71 , told @entity10			2
the ovaries make the hormone oestrogen , which has a protective effect on the heart			1
levels of the hormone drop after the menopause , raising the risk of heart disease she and her team analysed blood samples of more than 1,000 women aged 25 to 45 for their level of @entity87 hormone ( @entity88 ) , which estimates the remaining egg supply			2
the number of eggs was then confirmed using an ultrasound and each woman 's biological age was estimated by assessing her telomeres			2
these are tiny structures that protect @entity98 from damage and are an indicator of health			1
scientists have discovered the reason why women find it difficult to conceive later in life - they have used up 90 per cent of their ' ovarian reserve ' by the age of 30			2
this ovarian reserve - the potential number of eggs women are born with - declines faster than many people realise , the study by the @entity110 and @entity111 , found			2
by the age of 30 there is only 12 per cent left on average and by the age of 40 just three per cent , they warned			0
found at the ends of chromosomes , they protect the @entity98 in them from damage , much like the caps on the ends of shoelaces prevent fraying			0
as we get older , our telomeres get shorter and shorter , leading to @entity98 becoming damaged and raising the odds of age - related illnesses such as @entity132 's , diabetes and heart disease			1
shorter than average telomeres are seen as a sign of ill health and premature death			0
three to five years later , a quarter of the women returned to have their risk of heart disease calculated , based on factors such as weight , blood pressure and cholesterol levels			0
the researchers found women with lower egg counts were at a higher risk of heart disease			2
however they also had shorter telomeres - meaning they were at higher risk of conditions such as @entity132 's and diabetes			1
professor @entity70 said : ' we think the ovary may be more sensitive to the processes of ageing , ' says @entity163 , making it like a canary in a coal mine for a general state of accelerated ageing .			0

was known that hormone oestrogen has a protective effect on the heart
so an early menopause puts woman at *greater* risk of heart *problems*
new study found early menopause may signal faster ageing generally
these women had shorter telomeres - tiny structures that protect *dna* from damage and an indicator of health and life expectancy
short telomeres raise the risk of conditions like @entity132 's and diabetes
