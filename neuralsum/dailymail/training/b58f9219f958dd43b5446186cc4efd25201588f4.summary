with the @entity1 standing proudly above decorative @entity3 buildings , this looks like a magnificent view of the famous @entity6 capital			1
however , not all is at it seems			0
incredibly , this @entity10 scene is actually in the middle of @entity12			0
the @entity14 development in @entity15 , @entity16 , is filled with grand @entity3 buildings and wide walkways			1
ornate fountains and statues also line the streets of the town			0
this is a view of the @entity14 development in @entity15 , @entity12			1
despite being built as a replica of @entity10 , the town has not proved popular and is virtually empty empty : the @entity14 development in @entity15 is designed to accommodate at least 10,000 people but it has instead been labelled as a ghost town fierce : a huge thunder storm streaks across the @entity1 replica replica : with @entity12 's love of all things @entity6 , the developers must have thought they were onto a winner when they built @entity14 copy - cat : the town is filled with @entity10 houses and , despite being in the middle of @entity12 , has a distinct @entity3 feel during its construction in 2007 , a replica of the @entity1 standing at 108 metres was even built			1
there is also a replica of a fountain from the @entity45 in a main square called @entity47			0
with @entity12 's love of all things @entity6 , the developers no doubt expected the town to be a huge success			1
but things have n't quite worked out as they would have hoped			0
different : despite attempting to look like the famous @entity6 city , the town is is surrounded by farmland and dirt roads quirky : almost everything about the town has a @entity3 edge , such as this fountain odd : this image perhaps best demonstrates the confusion at the heart of the town			2
a farmer tills the surrounding farmland in front of the @entity1 looking good : despite not exactly proving popular , the town does look impressive @entity70 : the @entity14 development is located in the @entity16 of @entity12			1
this picture shows a farmer 's house plush : this resident stands on the balcony of his apartment at the development , admiring the empty streets below shop : despite being nowhere near as busy as the developers hoped for , it still contains a number of businesses , including this supermarket despite being designed to accommodate at least ten thousand people , the town remains sparsely populated			2
local media have now started labelling it as a ' ghost town ' , with pictures showing the large streets remaining virtually empty			2
images from the town show how @entity12 's aspirations and its traditional culture collide			0
surrounded by farmland and wide roads , farmers can be seen working in fields with the mock @entity1 looming over them			0

@entity14 development designed to look just like the @entity6 capital
but it has been labelled a ' ghost town ' because fewer people than expected have moved in
