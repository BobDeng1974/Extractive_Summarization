' these transactions represented purchases of gym memberships , food [ and ] hotel space , ' according to the report			2
and many purchases were ' split ' among two or more transactions in order to avoid spending more than $ 3,000 at a time â€“ an amount that should trigger more extensive scrutiny			0
some of the 80 transactions the @entity19 chose to audit represented payments to vendors listed in the categories like ' dance hall , ' ' child care ' or ' theater and music , ' the report explains			1
@entity46 ! several @entity4 employees used taxpayer - funded credit cards to buy themselves -- and their families -- gym memberships @entity4 employees with government credit cards spent taxpayer dollars on gym memberships , gift cards , and even charity donations seven separate cases were identified where @entity4 employees bought untraceable gift cards with taxpayer funds			1

' @entity92 president @entity104 took it in stride			0
