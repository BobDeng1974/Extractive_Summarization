they were a race of ferocious warriors , famous for their terrifying seaborne attacks and incredible shipbuilding abilities			0
but if you thought the age of the @entity7 was past , @entity8 , 66 , king of a band of modern - day warriors from @entity11 in @entity12 , is living proof that for some , they never really went away			1
part of a community living and working in the @entity18 town @entity19 on the southern @entity12 coast , @entity8 says the life of a @entity18 is a fascinating one and adds he has no plans to return to modern life			1
@entity18 life : @entity8 ( centre ) and the other vikings live and work in the village 24 hours a day , 365 days a year ' it 's a mysterious lifestyle , ' he elaborates			1
' of course i can go into modern times as soon as i step outside the village			2
' i could just go and watch the tv but when i do come back to the village after [ venturing out ] , i realise how beautiful [ living like a @entity18 ] is			1
' for @entity8 and his band of @entity18 warriors , daily life in @entity39 includes making time to work the surrounding fields and feasting on porridge , although as king , @entity8 does n't have to work if he does n't feel like it			1
' i just declared it , ' he says of the moment he was crowned king of the @entity18 village			1
' i said ok i am king			0
' we have people visiting the village every day and i spend time communicating with them , ' he adds			2
home : @entity8 outside his traditional @entity18 home in the village of @entity39 near @entity11 peaceful : @entity8 , who unilaterally declared himself king , says he loves the relaxed lifestyle in @entity39 fiery portents , a dragon seen streaking across the @entity62 sky and whirlwinds lashing the coast could mean only one thing to the fearful @entity66 watching the heavens in 793 - doom was imminent			1
and doom duly came in the shape of the @entity7 , who between 793 and 1066 were a hazardous part of life for the @entity66			1
most came from @entity74 , although @entity76 vikings were also known to have had a taste for @entity79 gold			1
either way , following the @entity84 attack , @entity18 power and influence grew until by 849 , the year @entity80 was born , they held much of the north and east			2
although he managed to halt their advance , raids did n't cease until after the @entity89			0
and while the @entity7 may be gone from @entity79 shores , their influence does live on in the @entity94 language			1
@entity95 , which means murderous rage , comes from the @entity66 ' beserker ' or clad in bear - skin - an early term used to describe the @entity7			2
' all the other @entity7 will be out working in the fields and working on the farm but i can spend my time just looking around , or sailing or enjoying a chat or playing a game			2
' but while @entity8 ensures life in the @entity18 village is as authentic as possible , there 's one part of @entity18 life that he 's not allowed to recreate			1
' really , it depends what you mean by raids , ' he muses			0
' we have friends in [ other @entity18 communities ] in @entity118 and we visit each other and each other 's markets			2
' we swap @entity18 tools			0
we travel all over the place because there are @entity7 all over @entity118			0
' while raids on the @entity79 coast might be out of the question , there are still some other forms of entertainment available to @entity131 and his band of modern - day @entity7			1
most exciting of all are the feast days when @entity131 and his cohorts get to swap their daily fare for a meat - heavy feast			0
' everyone thinks it was meat and meat and meat , ' he explains of his @entity18 forebears			0
' but it was n't , they ate with their hands and it was berries and pork			0
' they eat porridge and bread every day along with a very light beer			0
if they kill an animal they do n't waste it , they eat it			0
' he adds : ' if a @entity18 has done well like pulling in a ship then they get a strong beer and meat as a reward - as a celebration of what they 've done			2
' @entity8 , who says his family - all of whom do normal jobs and live in modern homes - come to stay with him in the village in the summer , is also keen to rehabilitate the reputation of the @entity7			1
they were n't , he says , just ferocious warriors and they most certainly did n't live in furs and horned helmets - for some of the time at least			0
old fashioned : all cooking in @entity39 is done over open fires , while food comes from the fields or storerooms in charge : @entity8 does n't have to work so spends his days chatting to visitors or sailing his boat ' everyone thinks that @entity7 have horns , ' he complains			1
they wore clothes made from silk and linen and had a bow and a spear for killing			0
' some @entity7 had helmets to protect themselves and some might have had pieces of metal sticking out but not horns			0
' you ca n't have horns because if you think about it , if you are fighting with horns , someone could grab those horns and drag you down - it 's very dangerous			0
' happily for @entity8 , there 's not much fighting to be done when you 're a modern - day @entity18 and he says he would n't have it any other way			1
' modern day life is so rushed with all this modern technology , ' he explains			2
' here you can relax and look at the sea and see the sunset			0
' @entity8 and his @entity18 warriors appear on @entity215 with @entity216 , friday at 10pm on @entity217 .			1

@entity8 is the ruler of a band of modern - day @entity12 vikings
lives in a small village and lives exactly as a @entity18 would have done
he and other villagers live @entity18 lives 24hrs a day , 365 days a year
says he has no plans to return to modern life and loves the peace
sadly for @entity8 , @entity7 can no longer go on raids so @entity79 coast is safe
