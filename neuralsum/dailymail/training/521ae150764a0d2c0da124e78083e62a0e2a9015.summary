by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 10:22 est , 28 february 2014 @entity4 : 21:20 est , 28 february 2014 wedding guests these days go to great lengths to avoid giving the happy couple identical presents			1
so imagine the surprise of @entity10 and @entity11 when they opened their gifts to find they had been given 27 toasters			1
the models ranged from cheap £ 6 ones to £ 25 ones from big name brands			2
@entity10 and @entity11 with some of the toasters they received from wedding guests piled into their car @entity10 and @entity11 on their wedding day ( l ) and some of the toasters they received for their wedding ( r ) the couple had not sent out a wedding list before their big day because they wanted their friends and family to choose their own gifts			1
mr @entity35 , 44 , and his 37 - year - old wife were married in @entity37 in october but held a reception for 80 guests near their @entity41 home two weeks ago			1
' we deliberately did n't send out a wedding list , ' they said			1
' we did n't want presents			2
we 've lived together for seven years and have everything we need			2
' when some friends insisted , we said perhaps they could get us vouchers			0
but then we made the mistake of saying , off hand : " we do n't need anything more ... especially not a toaster " '			1
the groom , a sales manager for a photocopying firm , said : ‘ we did notice that the presents all looked similar shapes – they were all rectangular and around the same size – but we did n’t really think anything of it			0
’ guest @entity60 and his partner ( left ) and @entity62 with family ( right ) with the toaster they gave more guests who contributed to @entity10 and @entity11 's crazy toaster collection they then learned they were the victims of a prank organised by best man @entity68 , 40			1
mrs @entity69 , a nurse , said : ‘ the first we knew what was really happening was when @entity68 got up and said , “ please raise your glasses for a toaster to the happy couple ”			1
‘ we just could n’t stop laughing as we opened them all up			0
’ ' the fact that @entity68 said we should open the presents was weird in itself			0
' as we started opening them it was so funny			0
by the time we had finished the pile was from the floor to the roof			0
' they were nearly all @entity84 's and @entity85 toasters so a lot of thought had been put in it			0
' the gauntlet has been laid down now			0
i 'm already thinking of something to do for my friend 's wedding			2
' twenty of the toasters have now been returned and the remaining seven will be given to homeless charity framework .			0

@entity10 and @entity11 from @entity41 did n't send wedding list
were pranked by 27 of their 80 guests who all got them a toaster
couple realised they had been taken for a ride when their best man said : ' please raise your glasses for a toaster to the happy couple '
