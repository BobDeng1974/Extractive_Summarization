@entity5 then delivered the line : ' i really did wake up like this because my parents never comb my hair			0
' obviously immediately regretting the scripted diss , she awkwardly giggled before adding : ' @entity41 , i love you ! ' but it was n't good enough for fans , who took to @entity45 in their droves to call her out on the mean - spirited ' joke '			1
' i really did wake up like this because my parents never comb my hair ' : the two - and - a - half - year - old , who appeared on stage with her famous parents during sunday night 's @entity33 , was the butt of a mean - spirited joke delivered by @entity55 low blow : the adorable little girl looked absolutely gorgeous with her hair worn in natural curls as she hit the stage in her father 's arms to present her mom with the @entity64 twitter user @ caitlynanala wrote : ' @entity5 making fun of @entity69 's @entity33 hair is a testament to not only her irrelevance , but her desperation ! lmao			1
' ' the fact that @entity0 had @ karrueche throw a jab at blue ivy 's hair on 106 & park			1
& they wonder why they ca n't get @entity11 to perform live , ' commented @ briiitea			0
' as a human being w / a brain , it 's also a bit worrying that @ @entity84 would bully 2 - year - old @entity10 on @ @entity0			1

' rookie mistake : @entity13 's 26 - year - old girlfriend and co-host @entity32 's gag went down like a lead balloon , with the model giggling awkwardly before apologising , ' @entity101 , i love you ! ' script change : @entity5 was said to be mortified following the incident , with both she and her manager fuming that she was put in that situation , the punchline apparently having changed since earlier rehearsals a source close to @entity55 tells @entity111 she simply read the joke verbatim off the teleprompter , the script apparently having changed since rehearsals			2
she insists she did n't see the joke beforehand and was mortified afterwards , with both she and her manager going ' nuclear ' because they too felt the comment was in ' poor taste '			2
speaking to @entity111 , @entity5 admitted she actually admires the child 's hairstyle , saying : ' i love that @entity122 is able to wear her natural hair			0
' @entity0 president @entity124 also issued an apology via @entity45 , in which he revealed that he had reached out to @entity11 and @entity9 and is taking ' punitive actions ' against the producers who put the guest host in that unfortunate position			1
hitting back : @entity55 attempted to defend herself , taking to @entity45 following the show to explain that the gag was scripted and not her idea showing the love : she also made this comment as she insisted she 's a huge fan of @entity122 's famous mom , @entity11 over four messages he wrote : ' last night on @entity15 there was a stupid , unthoughtful joke made about a young child			2
