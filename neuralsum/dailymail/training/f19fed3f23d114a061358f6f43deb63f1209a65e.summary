@entity0 has a big , long weekend ahead of him			1
on friday night he is tasked with keeping @entity1 from finding the net			1
on monday , there is @entity4 to contend with			1
arguably , two of the best five attackers in the world in the space of four days			1
the @entity11 goalkeeper pulls on his @entity13 jersey to resume their qualifying campaign for @entity16 and will line - up in @entity18 to face the world most expensive player for a sixth time in his career			1
a point of interest : so far , @entity1 has yet to score			1
@entity0 has a tough weekend ahead of him , where he will face @entity25 and then @entity26 within those games , @entity0 ( right ) will face @entity1 and @entity4 - two of the best attackers around @entity29 has been beaten by @entity1 , @entity30 and @entity31 too			1
‘ hopefully we can keep it that way , ’ he says , having been previously unaware			0
‘ that would be good			0
’ they have played on opposing teams four times for @entity39 and @entity11 , dating back to april 2011 and as recently as may 2013			0
in february last year , @entity0 tweeted that @entity1 had gone into ‘ @entity40 ’ after scoring a brace , including a brilliant late winner , against @entity43 at @entity44			1
but six months prior to that @entity0 kept a clean sheet as @entity13 beat @entity25 , and @entity1 , 2 - 0 in a friendly in @entity47			1
such quirks happen in football and @entity1 has progressed his talents to a higher level since moving to @entity52 but it provides a mini-duel to note when their nations collide			1
‘ i ’ve had the joy of playing against him a few times and had a lot of fun doing it , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i think he is up there now as one of the best players in the world			2
make no mistake about it , it will be a huge test for us as a whole team to try and contain him			0
‘ @entity25 as a team have grown			2
they have factors all over the pitch and good players in each position			0
but obviously @entity1 stands out			2
he is going to be a tough player to mark			0
’ since we spoke , @entity79 and @entity80 have been forced out through injury , bringing the focus on @entity1 even greater			2
@entity1 ( left ) has been in great form for @entity52 , but he is yet to score against @entity0 in six attempts @entity1 ( left ) , pictured with @entity87 midfielder @entity86 , has been training with @entity25 this week @entity0 is speaking at a fundraiser for his self - named charity foundation , which grants money to improve sporting facilities in @entity11 and his native @entity13			1
it is clearly something he has close to heart , having fled his war - torn homeland with his family aged four			2
‘ the charity has been set up to build sporting facilities , rebuild current ones , ’ he explains			0
‘ it is mainly to do with encouraging kids to go out , enjoy sport , be active			0
it affects so many different areas of life that it can do good			0
it ’s in @entity13 and the local @entity108 area			2
’ @entity109 has been @entity111 ’s spur			0
not only is the 27 - year - old one of the most consistent goalkeepers in the @entity114 , he is also a fan of tennis , basketball , baseball , @entity118 , and hockey , name - dropping @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity123 as heroes			2
that @entity126 link comes from growing up in @entity127 , @entity128 , having moved across the @entity129 from @entity130			0
he can speak @entity13 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 ( from his time playing in @entity26 ) as a result			1
his season to date has been mixed			0
two clean sheets against @entity138 and @entity139 , but five goals conceded against @entity141 and @entity142			0
@entity11 are yet to fire like they did last season			0
@entity0 played all three of @entity13 's matches at the @entity145 , pictured conceding against @entity146 hazard will be a huge threat to @entity0 's goal on monday , when @entity13 play host to @entity26 the same goes for @entity13 , who suffered a shock loss to @entity153 to place extra importance on the @entity25 match on friday night			1
wales beat @entity157 2 - 1 thanks to a @entity1 brace in their first match , while @entity26 and @entity163 complete qualifying @entity161 ‘ of course it puts a bit more pressure on the @entity25 game , ’ says @entity0 of the 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity153			1
‘ going forward the group is going to be very competitive , it ’s very open , teams will get points off each other			0
‘ so even though we lost the first game nothing is lost in the big picture			0
hopefully if we can get a positive result in @entity18 we can push on from there and get as many points as we need to qualify for the tournament			0
‘ whether we go directly or via play - off it does n’t matter as long as we get there in the end			2
’ @entity0 played all 270 minutes of @entity13 ’s @entity145 , where they lost narrowly to @entity185 and @entity146 before beating @entity186 3 - 1 but failing to make it to the knock - out phase			1
‘ we got to play against @entity185 at the @entity189			2
it does n’t get much better than that , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ just being part of that makes you a better player , a better person			0
gives you a sense of achievement			0
‘ no matter the results we made the most of the whole experience and hopefully we can become a better team going forwards and use it as motivation to be involved in more major tournaments			0
’ congratulations to @entity206 for alienating not one , but two sets of fans over their vote to sell the @entity211 to @entity212 in a £ 20million deal			1
not only are the rugby team ’s supporters understandably angry at the prospect of having to trek an extra 82 miles to attend home games , but @entity206 ’s faithful are also wary at what it might mean for them			1
@entity212 have agreed a deal to move to the @entity211 , alienating both their fans and @entity206 only last month the football team returned to the ground , on an initial two - year basis , after an exile in @entity226 but that security is cast in doubt			1
how will the ground - share work ? will the colours change ? what about the pitch ? questions supporters would like answers to			0
the fractious relationship between the council and @entity206 owners sisu means communication was always likely to be minimal but in this game of financial brinksmanship it is the fans who suffer			1
speaking of which , @entity243 have been offered an olive branch by local rivals @entity246 as the latest chapter in their sorry ownership continues			1
@entity246 will allow hundreds of @entity250 fans to protest against the running of their club during their conference match against @entity254 on wednesday night , which is broadcast live on @entity109			1
@entity250 , famous for @entity256 ’s rocket , dropped two divisions this summer to the @entity258 because of financial irregularities and remain in deep money troubles			2
@entity264 , @entity265 vice-chairman , said : ‘ we are going to be singing a few songs , we 've got some banners			0
basically we 're going to make a noise			0
