every night , 23 - year - old graduate @entity0 dreams about the perfect life she deserves			1
we know this because she has written about it on her blog , complete with dewy pictures of herself			1
‘ i think about how i ’ll have the perfect figure , a nice house , a good job ( preferably blogging full - time ) , a successful novel in the pipeline and my boyfriend and my dog by my side , ’ she writes			1
‘ i ’ll go travelling thanks to my blog and i ’ll be able to afford holidays of my own , several times a year			2
her website is called away with @entity26			1
given the gap between reality and these frothy expectations , the name would be laughably apt were it not so tragic			2
but @entity0 is hardly alone in her impossible fantasies			1
away with the fairies could be a tag ( or perhaps hash tag ) for her entire generation			2
for it is not so much @entity37 — the name given to those born in the @entity40 and @entity41 — but @entity42 , famous and successful ? as shaky economic growth leaves many twenty - somethings stranded from the property and job markets , many still believe a life of glamour and opportunity will miraculously materialise for them			1
but @entity51 is heading for a serious fall , say experts			1
one of the world ’s leading psychiatrists warns of the dangers of elevated expectations and lofty self - esteem			1
professor @entity59 , a former president of the @entity60 , says the selfie - loving generation are unlikely to develop the tools to deal with failure because they are used to being puffed up by online ego - massaging			2
away with the fairies : @entity0 's blog details her lofty expectations of graduate life he even fears that the inevitable failure to live up to their own expectations will one day trigger spikes in violence , depression and suicide			1
‘ the difference between young people ’s expectations and the reality of their lives is wider than ever , ’ he explains			1
‘ there is a considerable amount of research which shows that the discrepancy between aspirations and what you actually achieve is an incredibly important factor in psychiatric disorders			2
one of the hypotheses posited to explain high rates of suicide in some countries is when people think they ’re capable of something and then do n’t make it			1
‘ already , rates of depression are going up			1
it stands to reason that the suicide rate might go up , too			2
’ indeed , @entity0 is already feeling depressed as she considers the vast , jolting shortfall between her dream and her actual life			1
‘ i thought i would land a job at a magazine writing about beauty but that has n’t happened , ’ she says			0
‘ i thought i ’d have my own swanky apartment and be living the high life but it has n’t worked out like that			1
two years after graduating , i ’m still living at home , with no job , and no further ahead			1
’ worse still , the endless rejections from employers are proving demotivating — the opposite of what she needs			0
‘ it makes me feel , “ what ’s the point of getting out of bed ? ” because i do n’t have anything to work for			0
i ’m at the end of my tether			0
’ after graduating in 2012 , @entity0 had a string of internships and short - term jobs , at a book distributor and as a marketing assistant , but , so far , her ideal career has failed to materialise			1
her parents , she says , are ‘ desperate ’ for her to ‘ move out and get a job anywhere ’			0
but while it would be easy to blame @entity0 and others like her for their unrealistic expectations , analysis of the problem shows they are victims of a deeper malaise			1
unrealistic expectations : aged 23 , a depressed @entity0 is unemployed and living at home with her parents for several decades now , the mantra spouted by everyone from teachers and social workers to pop stars has been that the key to achieving success is simply to visualise it			1
youngsters have been schooled to believe they can do anything and that they deserve a fantastic home , career and relationship			2
when @entity158 was booming , such aspirations were perhaps understandable			0
today , however , 20 per cent of young people are out of work and 26 per cent of 20 to 34 - year - olds live with their parents — an increase of a quarter since 1996			1
the average age of first - time buyers is now at a high of 29 , with two thirds needing help from @entity169 and @entity170 to get on the property ladder			2
inflated sense of importance : @entity0 admits that having lots of followers and posting pictures of herself on photo - sharing sites massaged her ego dovetailing these stark statistics have been two culture - defining phenomena : reality television and social media			1
the latter , says professor @entity59 , is the true culprit			0
‘ social media feeds narcissism and stokes expectations , ’ he says			2
‘ with the resulting sense of entitlement comes a feeling that one does n’t need to work hard to achieve			0
‘ when someone has 16,000 @entity195 followers , they can feel as if that in itself is an achievement			0
’ @entity0 , an avid @entity195 and @entity199 user , admits that having lots of followers and posting pictures of herself on photo - sharing sites @entity200 and @entity201 gives her an inflated sense of importance			1
‘ you get a great response and think , “ i ’m good at this ! ” she says			0
‘ but when it comes to that turning into a job , it ’s a different story			0
’ compounding the problem is the way in which twenty - somethings present their lives on social media , editing out the reality to convey an enviable lifestyle			1
‘ for five years i ’ve been reading blogs about people jetting off to @entity223 and you think , “ why ca n’t i have a piece of that ? ” ’ says @entity0			1
social media executive @entity226 , 25 , whose own aspirations of a glamorous fashion career never came true , is also affected by this highly - edited showboating — and does it herself			2
‘ it ’s like an addiction , ’ she says			0
‘ once you ’re posting pictures of yourself on @entity200 in your best dress , on a crazy night out , the pressure to keep up that pretence is scary , and i ’m guilty of it			0
‘ tonight i will be reading with my make - up off , but my @entity200 will show some beautiful shot of a glass of prosecco and a @entity245 candle to make it look fancy			2
’ @entity226 , who lives in her boyfriend ’s house in @entity249 , adds : ‘ everything in our lives goes through a filter			0
we ’re too afraid to say , “ this is how things really are			0
this is how i really look			0
” ’ it is a problem which concerns many middle - class parents			2
@entity259 , 46 , a lecturer in social work , still has her son @entity261 , 23 , living at home with her in @entity263 , @entity249			1
missing out : @entity264 , who was unable to go to university and lives at home with mum @entity259 , says being unable to move out is ' disappointing and frustrating ' he had dreamed of going to university and becoming a history teacher — precisely the sort of ambition the previous @entity269 government encouraged			2
this is the consequence of @entity274 ’s determination that half of young people should go to university , regardless of which jobs would ultimately be available			1
cult of the individual : @entity259 blames reality tv for the idea you can become rich and famous without trying ‘ a lot of @entity261 ’s friends have a fatalistic attitude , as if things will just happen for them , ’ says @entity259			0
‘ it ’s all very narcissistic			0
i ’m from a background where if you did n’t work hard you got nowhere			0
’ as well as the internet , @entity259 blames reality tv			0
‘ @entity294 fed into this idea that everyone is special and has a story and could become rich and famous without doing anything , ’ she says			0
‘ the cult of the individual has been coming for some time and is firmly here to stay			0
’ @entity261 ’s university hopes were dashed after a cycling accident left him with injuries which meant his a-level grades — two @entity306 — suffered and this combined with steep university fees made higher education all but impossible			0
five years on , he works 28 hours a week in a library			0
he says : ‘ i ’ve felt like i ’m missing out because my friends all went to university			0
i see them on @entity199 celebrating graduations and boasting of their party lifestyle			0
’ not being able to move out due to rocketing rents is also ‘ disappointing and frustrating ’ , he says			2
yet @entity261 himself , a sensible and level - headed young man , falls prey to social media			1
‘ you ca n’t help but feel a bit self - important when loads of people “ like ” a comment on @entity199 , or if you tweet someone famous and they reply , ’ he says			1
meanwhile @entity0 and her friends continue to struggle with life ’s harsh realities			1
‘ everyone is feeling like me — disheartened			0
they thought they ’d have gone a lot further			0

despite shaky economic growth , 20 - somethings still believe a life of glamour and opportunity will miraculously materialise for them
but experts says @entity51 is heading for a serious fall
@entity0 , author of blog ' away with @entity26 ' , is dreaming about her perfect life , yet is unemployed and living at home
depression rates have risen among young people due to failed expectations
