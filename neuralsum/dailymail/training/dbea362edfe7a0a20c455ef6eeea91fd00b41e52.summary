by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell those @entity2 tears were as much for conceding a 3 - 0 lead to effectively end @entity5 ’s title hopes as for the realisation that an opportunity this golden may not come again soon			1
@entity9 will urge his team - mates to ‘ go again ’ before the start of next season but that task will be made more difficult by the certainty that their rivals will ‘ come again ’			1
@entity5 had appeared like the irresistible force , possessing enough momentum from swashbuckling football and the memories of @entity20 to sweep to their first league crown in 24 years			2
it was @entity5 who had the sense of an unstoppable team building to a climax			1
but @entity54 ’s double decker halted the procession , then @entity52 ’s @entity51 chopped it to a stand - still			0
if @entity40 beat @entity57 on wednesday night , as seems certain , @entity5 will have missed a glorious chance to finally re-emerge as @entity59 ’s best			1
they may well be better next season for the experience			0
but you can be assured that so will all their title competitors			0
chopped down : @entity64 celebrates with goalscorer @entity65 following @entity28 's equaliser @entity40 will improve their defence with @entity69 centre - back @entity68 a likely arrival , while @entity37 will have a greater grasp on this league having shorn his nearly - man tag			1
@entity54 will get a top class striker , with @entity75 set to provide the spike to @entity36 ’s weapon , often so blunt this season			0
@entity43 will spend big under @entity79 , and surely be a huge improvement on this campaign			0
wanted : @entity40 are expected to improve their defence with the signing of @entity69 's @entity68 ( left ) top class : @entity85 striker @entity75 looks set to provide the spike to @entity36 's weapon at @entity54 changes : @entity43 will spend big under @entity89 and surely improve on this campaign @entity91 will once again consolidate and , should @entity92 and @entity93 be fit for the campaign , prove challengers again			2
even @entity97 , with @entity98 a year wiser , and @entity99 , under a new head coach , will spend money to improve			0
@entity5 are back among the big boys but they might well rue not picking them off this season , when they all looked that little bit smaller			2
back among the big boys : @entity5 manager @entity24 and his side will rue letting the title slip			1

@entity24 ' team conceded a 3 - 0 lead to @entity28 on monday night
draw at @entity2 effectively ended @entity5 's title *dream*
