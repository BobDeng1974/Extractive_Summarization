by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 3 september 2013 @entity1 made a spectacular return to her post as an x factor judge on saturday night as the new season of the reality show kicked off			1
the 60 - year - old 's refreshing tell - it - like - it - is attitude and warm humour has made her a firm favorite across the nation , and she has become a fashion icon for older women			1
though she has never been shy about her various cosmetic surgery procedures , fans were shocked at @entity1 's appearance on saturday night , with her slightly ' stretched ' look causing some to question whether she has gone too far			1
@entity1 's face seemed puffy and swollen at times during the first two x factor episodes of the new season @entity1 returned to the x factor judging panel , much to the delight of her fans , but her face was noticeably different than the last time she sat alongside @entity28 @entity1 attracted attention when she was pictured leaving her @entity31 hotel on august 6 this year looking swollen in 2012 , the talent show judge vowed not to undergo any further cosmetic surgery following numerous health issues , including a double mastectomy @entity1 , who appeared alongside other judges @entity36 , 61 , @entity38 , 42 and @entity39 , 35 , appeared puffy and her eyes had taken on a slightly cat - like look			1
last year , @entity1 spoke about how she had taken the decision to not have anymore cosmetic surgery after recovering from colon cancer and undergoing a double mastectomy			1
speaking on @entity47 chat show the talk in 2012 , @entity1 said : ' no more , because i have been looking at pictures of myself recently since i started to lose weight			1
' and in a lot of shots , my face looks plastic and at certain angles i was like , ' oh , dear			2
oh , i should never have done that			2
oh , that 's a bad one			0
' so i 'm like , ' no more			0
'' @entity1 with friend @entity60 at the 18th @entity62 @entity61 in 2010 @entity1 with rocker husband @entity63 and daughter @entity64 at @entity65 in 2008 for the brit awards in 2007 , a very glamorous looking @entity1 released her second book ' @entity68 ' after the success of her first autobiography ' @entity71 ' @entity1 looked youthful but fairly natural as she posed with daughter @entity64 in 2006 @entity1 2005 ( right ) and 2006 ( left ) the media personality and wife of @entity63 has previously admitted having spent an eye - watering £ 300,000 on plastic surgery , including a gastric band ( which resulted in her dropping over 100lbs ) , eye lift , facelift , tummy tuck , @entity81 , a full facelift , abdominoplasty , and breast lift			1
on her own chat show in 2006 , @entity1 introduced her plastic surgeon dr. @entity87 to talk about her various procedures , and even had @entity89 injected live in front of the studio audience			1
' i think that @entity81 is one of the best things to be created in plastic surgery , ' @entity1 gushed			1
despite admitting that she had to have all the procedures she had undergone listed off camera because they were too numerous to remember , @entity1 even booked in for another breast lift and upper arm procedure while on air			1
after surviving colon cancer in 2004 , the reality show the @entity1 's was becoming a huge success and @entity1 was winning over the hearts of women the world over for her no - nonsense attitude a less glamorous @entity1 attended the ' @entity109 ' film premiere in 2000 @entity1 and @entity63 posed in @entity60 's famous glasses in 1997 @entity1 and @entity63 in 1992 when @entity1 was managing @entity63 's solo career after he left the band @entity112 back in 1991 , @entity1 is almost unrecognisable - very different from the woman we know today @entity112 rock star @entity63 married @entity1 in @entity115 in 1982 , with @entity1 looking markedly different to how she does now the proud cosmetic surgery aficionado says : ' i 'm the only person , who goes to the cosmetic surgeons for surgery , who comes out and i do n't have a scarf over their face when the paparazzi are there			1
i 'm like " hi ! " ' as we age , our faces begin to show the effects of gravity , sun exposure and years of facial muscle movement , such as smiling , chewing and squinting			2
the underlying tissues that keep our skin looking youthful and plumped up begin to break down , often leaving laugh lines , smile lines , crow ’s feet or facial creases over the areas where this muscle movement occurs			0
soft - tissue fillers can help fill in these lines and creases , temporarily restoring a smoother , more youthful - looking appearance			2
when injected beneath the skin , these fillers plump up creased and sunken areas of the face			0
they can also be used for lip enhancement and to add fullness to the cheeks and for a chin implant			0
injectable fillers are primarily used to improve the appearance of the skin ’s texture			0
they can help fill out deep facial wrinkles , creases and furrows , “ sunken ” cheeks , skin depressions and some types of scars			0
they can also be used to add a fuller , more sensuous look to the lips and for lip enhancement			0
dr. @entity170 of the @entity171 of @entity172 while many have applauded her openness around cosmetic surgery , @entity1 's recent appearance indicated she may have gone too far			1
dr. @entity170 of the @entity171 of @entity172 said : ' i think this puffiness and slight lopsided facial expression comes from the excess use of filler to plump the face and fill out the lips			0
' the lips especially have been overfilled - something @entity1 has n't tampered with too much in the past and which - in my opinion - is a mistake here			2
' however this is a non-permanent procedure so should go down in the next few weeks			0
' filler can be highly effective when used subtly to restore some loss of volume to the face , correcting hollow sunken cheeks and restoring a more youthful radiance ; something i felt @entity1 understood and kept well balanced in the past			2
' however , fillers can also look dreadful when used in excess , needing to be administered by an expert who knows how to balance the natural contours of the face			0
' surgery , both invasive and non invasive , is an art form , and should be used only to enhance one ’s natural features			0

@entity1 has been open about her cosmetic procedures
even had @entity81 live on her own chat show
the 60 - year - old looked ' stretched ' on latest @entity214 episodes
said in 2012 she would have no more procedures after surviving cancer
