by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 11:59 est , 13 december 2013 a mother - of - five who was dismissed from her gp 's surgery with tennis elbow has now been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer			1
@entity7 , 46 , was told to ignore the pain she felt lifting her arms , described by her doctor as a minor strain			1
but last month she went into hospital after finding a bone - like lump the size of a rib near her breast - and was told she has less than eight years to live			1
distraught : @entity7 , 46 , is warning others to watch out for signs themselves after she was wrongly diagnosed with tennis elbow after already contracting cancer in her lymph nodes following biopsies , mammograms and full body scans , hospital staff found the disease has been spreading in her lymph nodes and liver for years and that there is nothing they can do to cure her			1
and they revealed the tennis elbow diagnosed two years ago was in fact a symptom of aggressive cancer in the lymph nodes - which could have been stopped			1
' it is just horrific , ' said mrs @entity7 , mother to @entity43 , 29 , @entity44 , 26 , @entity45 , 19 , @entity46 , eight , and @entity47 , three			1
' if i ’d caught it earlier there may have been a cure			2
as it stands i just have to accept my lot			2
' when i found out it was terminal i sat in the car park at the hospital for about an hour unable to let go of the wall i was holding onto			1
' nothing is the same for me now			2
' my world has completely changed - i ’ve lost me , my identity , my life as i knew it			2
' mrs @entity7 , who has four grandchildren , visited her gp in 2011 after her elbow became unbearably sore and tender			1
six weeks ago , back in hospital , she was told the cancer is now too aggressive and invasive to treat			1
trying to be positive : mrs @entity7 says she wants to focus on the good points of her life and spend time with her children , including three - year - old @entity47 ( left in right - hand picture ) and eight - year - old @entity46 ( right ) she was predicted eight years to live - but that was before the disease was found in her liver			1
she was referred to a physiotherapist several months ago after the pain in her shoulder became unbearable			1
she said : ' i was referred to a physio as i had unbearable pain in my shoulder which i was told was a trapped nerve in my neck - i could n't lift my hand			1
' this turned out to be nerve damage caused by the cancer			1
when i was diagnosed it was pretty traumatic as i was told i had secondary breast cancer			1
' one month into treatment @entity91 , from @entity93 , is grappling to come to terms with the ramifications of the shocking blunder - and stay strong for her children			1
weakened after undergoing three different kinds of chemotherapy - one of which gave her an allergic reaction - she has had to ask her mother to move in , and could not attend her daughters ' nativity			2
' it ’s a very different world now , ' she said			0
' i ’m 46 and i ’m never going to get old and the fact that i have two small children is very hard to deal with too			2
gruelling : eight weeks into treatment , mrs @entity7 has told how she could not go to see her daughters ' nativity and has had to ask her mother to move in			1
she has to be strong for her children and grandchildren ' i ’m never going to see them grow up			0
my children are going to lose their mummy			0
' my older children are obviously traumatised by my diagnosis but they are very supportive			0
' ' my mum now lives with us through the week to look after me and help take the children to school and pick them up			0
' this week @entity46 and @entity47 were performing in their nativities and i was n’t well enough to go			0
' i ’ve watched every single thing they have both done			0
' that is a very real consequence of terminal cancer			2
' last week , as the treatment intensifies , mrs @entity7 asked her mother to shave her head			1
' me and my mum just wept the whole way through , ' she said			0
' my littlest ones got especially upset when i lost my hair			0
' they told me that i looked like a daddy			2
' it ’s been very hard for them because their mummy does n’t look the same and is very ill. ' they are sad that their mummy is not like she was			0
' despite what has happened , mrs @entity7 says she does not blame doctors for misdiagnosing her but wants to warn others to check themselves more regularly so they do n't make the same mistake			1
she said : ' i do n't think the doctors could have really foreseen the cancer			1
i bear no ill - feeling towards them			0
' if i had known sooner it may not have travelled but i 'm concentrating on trying to raise awareness of cancer as it 's affected my life unbelievably			2
' i want to ensure people check themselves for lumps and bumps more regularly so families do n't have to go through what i 'm going through			0
' suffering from an aggressive form of the disease , mrs @entity7 says she wants to enjoy the time she has left and warn people to be aware of stories like hers			1
she has now set out to raise £ 10,000 for two local charities , @entity165 and @entity166 , and amassed more than 300 likes on her @entity169 page , @entity171 's @entity170			0
mrs @entity7 said : ' i want people to think about cancer , i never did			1
' i want people to make sure they check themselves for any lumps and bumps			0
' my cancer is incurable so it ’s all about maintaining my life now			2
' i ’ve had three bouts of chemotherapy already , one of which i proved to be allergic to			0
@entity171 was supposed to have another round of chemotherapy on december 20 but has postponed it so she can enjoy @entity188 with her family , including her son , @entity43 , who has moved to @entity191			0
' chemotherapy is one of the hardest things i can imagine anyone going through			0
' i wo n’t spend the rest of my life on chemotherapy i do n’t want to be sick for the time i have left			0
' there will come a cut off point for me			0

' i guess that ’s a positive thing that ’s come out of all this			0
