finding water on @entity1 might be a bit of a challenge , but if you want to find ice you need look no further than the @entity1 poles			1
here there is an abundant source of carbon dioxide ice that exists for most of the year			1
and in stunning images from @entity12 the ice can be seen forming some bizarre and familiar shapes - in this case a ' happy face ' on the surface			1
they noticed the eyes , nose and upturned mouth shapes at one of many monitoring sites at the @entity25 residual cap ( @entity26 )			0
images are taken throughout the @entity1 year to document changes in carbon dioxide ice coverage the image was captured by @entity12 ’s @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , which has been in orbit around the red planet since 10 march 2006			1
@entity34 is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus			2
it is a form of apophenia , when people see patterns in random , unconnected data			0
there have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places			0
on the red planet , one of the most famous is the ' face on @entity1 ' spotted by one of the @entity55 orbiters in 1976			2
this was later proven to just be a chance alignment of shifting sand dunes			0
researchers noticed the face - like feature at one of many monitoring sites at the @entity25 residual cap ( @entity26 ) on @entity1			2
this is a region where carbon dioxide ice can be seen shifting throughout the year as the @entity1 climate changes			1
the face appears to have a mount , nose and even an upturned mouth to denote a smile			0
in the image the face is approximately 1,640ft ( 500m ) across			2
the features highlight different levels of elevation , and also different ice densities , on the surface			0
towards the edge of the face the dark areas show steep cliffs that descent from the top of this raised area to the ground below			0
the image shows a popular spot where one of the features resembles a smiley face that is approximately 1,640ft ( 500m ) across			1
the planetary feature was captured by @entity90 , one of six instruments on @entity12 's @entity31			1
in this zoomed - out image a ' rabbit ' can also be seen to the right of the face carbon dioxide ice is common at the @entity1 poles , where temperatures are cold enough for it to exist			1
away from the poles , however , ice is harder to find on the surface as it quickly evaporates onto the atmosphere			0
‘ images are taken throughout the @entity1 year to document changes in carbon dioxide ice coverage , ’ @entity12 ’s @entity105 said in a video			1
‘ this image shows a popular spot where one of the features represents a smiley face that is approximately 500 metres across			2
‘ if you smile at @entity1 , sometimes it smiles back			0
’ the image was captured by @entity12 ’s @entity31 ( illustration shown ) , which has been in orbit around the red planet since 10 march 2006 on the red planet , one of the most famous cases of pareidolia is the ' face on @entity1 ' spotted by one of the @entity55 orbiters in 1976 ( shown left )			1
this was later proven to just be a chance alignment of shifting sand dunes ( right )			0

researchers in @entity133 have captured an image of a face on @entity1
@entity12 ’s @entity31 captured the image
the face is about 1,640ft ( 500m ) across and has several facial features
it was *created* by shifting carbon dioxide ice at the @entity1 pole
the psychological *effect* of seeing faces is called pareidolia
