by @entity1 reporter published : 03:35 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 03:35 est , 13 july 2013 schools are boosting gcse results by forcing children to sit the same exam as many as seven times , a government investigation has found			1
growing numbers of schools are entering pupils for a series of different tests in @entity13 and maths but only recording their best score so as to hike their positions in league tables			0
in many cases , children are taking exams up to two years early and then sitting them again after failing to get good scores at the first attempt			2
schools are trying to manipulate exam performance tables by making pupils sit the same exams up to seven times , a @entity23 investigation has revealed ( file picture ) but the @entity23 found some schools are going to even more extreme measures to improve their performance , including allowing children to sit the same subject with different examination boards in the same year to maximise their chances of doing well			1
it has also emerged the number of pupils sitting both gcses and @entity40 - and alternative version of the qualification designed for schools overseas - has risen 10-fold in 12 months , with 5,700 pupils taking maths in both versions in 2012 - up from 600 the previous year			1
the @entity23 warned ' continually sitting examinations ' was harmful to children 's education			2
it also emerged 400 pupils took maths exams at least seven times in 2012 , a fourfold rise in 12 months			1
the @entity23 has pledged to halt the process by reforming school league tables and moving towards end - of - course exams			1
a spokesman said in the @entity58 : ' we are increasingly concerned about this			0
education secretary @entity61 has demanded a clampdown on the practice ' the evidence shows entering exams early , and then resitting , or sitting another exam in the same subject , is not good for pupils			1
' the changes we have made to gcses and reforms to the accountability system will help address this			0
we are considering further action to discourage this practice			0
' the cross-party commons education committee published a report last year that criticised the extent to which the exams system skewed pupils ' education			2
as part of the report , mps asked the @entity23 to investigate the problem of multiple exam entry and what action was needed to limit the practice			1
this week , officials published new research into the issue			0
seven per cent of pupils sat gcses in @entity13 more than once in 2012 , down from 25 per cent a year earlier			0
in maths , the numbers were as high as 41 per cent , compared with 28 per cent the previous year			0
some 4,500 pupils sat maths exams five times in 2012 , up from 800 in 2011			2
a further 400 took exams in the subject at least seven times , a significant increase on the 100 pupils doing so a year before			2
the @entity23 report stated many cases involved children who took ' different specifications ' - test papers in the same subject drawn up by different exam boards			1
it added : ' of the 63,800 pupils who took maths three times in 2012 , 50,000 - 78 per cent - included more than one specification in their entries			0
' the use of multiple specifications in mathematics in 2012 represented a significant increase when compared to 2011 ( when it accounted for only 14 per cent )			0

fourfold rise in number of pupils taking same exam multiple times
manipulation of system ' harmful ' to children , says @entity23
it vows to clampdown on practice by moving to - end - of - course exams
