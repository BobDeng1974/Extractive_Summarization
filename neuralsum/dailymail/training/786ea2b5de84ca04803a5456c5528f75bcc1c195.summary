by @entity0 published : 03:33 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 05:59 est , 26 october 2012 the @entity1 has declared a national emergency after it found a disease which has devastated ash trees in @entity5 has spread to the @entity7 countryside			1
ash dieback has been found in the wider environment at sites in @entity11 , and there are fears it could wreak the same kind of damage as @entity18 elm disease in the @entity19			1
responding to the outbreak , the government today said it will bring in a ban on ash imports and tight restrictions on ash movements within @entity7 on monday			1
under threat : an ash tree in @entity28			2
the @entity1 today warned that a virulent disease affecting the trees has spread to the @entity31 - and there are fears it could cause as much damage as @entity18 elm disease environment secretary @entity36 told mps of the plan after @entity39 , @entity40 mp for @entity41 and @entity42 , asked in @entity44 questions what steps the department was taking to deal with the disease			1
the @entity49 fungus , which causes leaf loss and crown dieback and can lead to tree death , wiped out 90 per cent of ash trees in @entity54 in seven years			1
it had previously been identified in nurseries and recently planted sites including a car park , a college campus and a new woodland			0
the @entity1 today announced that the fungus is being treated as a quarantine pest under national emergency measures and urged members of the public to report any suspected cases			1
ash dieback is a serious disease of ash trees caused by a fungus called @entity49 ( @entity72 fraxinea )			1
the disease causes leaf loss and crown dieback in affected trees , as pictured right , and it can lead to tree death			1
@entity5 trees now believed to have been infected with this newly identified pathogen were first reported dying in large numbers in @entity80 in 1992 and it spread rapidly to other @entity5 countries			0
however , it was 2006 before the fungus ’s asexual stage , @entity86 , was first described by scientists , and 2010 before its sexual stage , @entity89 pseudo-albidus , was described			0
in february 2012 it was found in a consignment of infected trees sent from a nursery in the @entity18 to a nursery in @entity96			0
since then it has been found in a number of locations and situations in @entity101 and @entity102 , including a car park in @entity104 ; a @entity1 woodland at @entity106 , near @entity107 , west of @entity108 ; a college campus in @entity110 ; and a property in @entity112			2
all these sites had received stocks of young ash plants from nurseries within the past five ears			2
however , now that infected older trees have been found in @entity11 with no apparent connection with nursery stock , the @entity1 are also investigating the possibility that it might have entered @entity7 by natural means			1
mr @entity36 told the @entity44 : ' i ’ve very grateful to [ mr @entity39 ] for raising this because there have been reports today on the radio of the horrific danger to our 80 million ash trees			2
' we have already launched a consultation on the ground looking in real detail to see whether this disease has taken root in this country			0
' that consultation will report to me tomorrow and i will discuss it over the weekend with the head of the @entity141 and i think on the evidence we are seeing , i intend to bring in a ban on imports and tight restrictions of ash movements within @entity141 on monday			1
' @entity149 ’s mp dame @entity147 criticised the timing of the coalition ’s response to the issue , arguing mr @entity36 would ' not be forgiven for any delay '			0
she said : ' may i tell the secretary of state that he should have banned the import of ash seedlings the minute the disease was actually found in nurseries in this country			2
he will not be forgiven for any delay by the people of this country who so value the ash trees			1
' will he ensure that the @entity1 has all the resources it needs to be able to confront this terrible threat ? ' mr @entity36 replied : ' i think she is being pretty unfair			2
the minute we heard about this we launched a consultation , that will report tomorrow , so on the basis of evidence , and all her colleagues are shouting at me about evidence and science based , i will look at the evidence from tomorrow evening and if it ’s a sensible decision i will ban the import and i will make restrictions on monday			1
' the @entity181 today confirmed the fungus had been found in both mature ancient woodland and woodland creation areas on its estate at @entity186 in @entity187			0
the @entity181 is supporting a ban on importing and moving ash trees in a bid to stop the disease becoming established in the @entity31 , which the government is poised to bring in as early as next week			1
the @entity193 has also urged members to abide by a voluntary moratorium on importing ash trees for planting in this country			2
but there are concerns that if it has been found in the wider countryside , a ban on imports could be of limited value			2
infected : a tree in @entity205 , @entity206 , suffering from ash dieback			1
the disease , caused by the @entity49 fungus , causes leaf loss and crown dieback and can lead to tree death in the @entity31 , ash trees make up around 30 per cent of the wooded landscape , across woodlands , hedgerows and park			1
losing the trees would have serious implications for @entity7 's ecology , warned @entity221 , head of woodland management for the @entity181			2
@entity18 elm disease caused the deaths of more than 25million elms in the @entity31 alone , almost completely eradicating one of the @entity101 countryside 's most distinctive trees			1
although @entity18 elm disease first reached these shores in 1927 , a new , more virulent strain appeared in 1967 to which the @entity101 elm was particularly susceptible			0
caused by a fungus spread by the elm bark beetle , the @entity18 elm disease is believed to actually be native to @entity235 , from where it was accidentally spread by man			0
thirty years after the outbreak of the epidemic nearly all of @entity7 's @entity101 elm trees , which often grew 150ft high , are gone			2
the species still survives in hedgerows , as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts ( ' suckers ' ) ; but these suckers rarely reach more than 5m before the fungus attacks			0
the largest remaining concentration of mature elm trees in @entity101 is in @entity250 and @entity251 , @entity252 , where 15,000 elms still stood in 2005 , several of which were estimated at over 400 years old			0
their survival is owing to the isolation of the area and efforts of local authorities remove infected sections of trees as soon as they show symptoms			0
' this is yet another example of why the protection of our native trees , natural resources and eco-systems needs to be at the top of the agenda and we need a step change in the level of importance placed on bio-security to tackle the bigger issue , ' he said			0
' the occurrence of tree diseases in the @entity31 is becoming far too frequent and once they are established we are often powerless to act			2
' we are potentially facing the ash equivalent of @entity18 elm disease , and unless we take serious measures as a country we will continue to see problems arising from imported diseases			0
' the @entity181 called for an emergency summit or taskforce to be set up by the government to tackle tree diseases , before another species was lost for good			0
dr @entity292 , head of the @entity1 ’s plant health service , said : ' we and our colleagues in the @entity296 , the @entity289 and the @entity297 have stepped up our efforts to tackle this disease as a priority			1
' this includes redeploying @entity1 staff from their usual duties to survey woods and forests in @entity11 and throughout @entity7			1
' he added : ' it is still early days and investigations are continuing , but there is a possibility that the @entity11 outbreak is an isolated one which has been present for some time			0
' this emphasises the importance of preventing spread further afield			0
' he urged forest managers and tree professionals to use the information on the @entity1 ’s website about the disease , inspect trees again and report any suspected to be infected			1
as a precaution , the @entity1 is suspending the planting of ash trees in public forests it manages			1
infected ash trees have also be identified at @entity330 ’s @entity329 reserve , @entity331			0
the trust ’s head of nature reserves , @entity332 , said : ' this is possibly the first case of ash dieback disease in established woodland in @entity338 , although it is likely we will now see further cases			1
' we are working closely with the plant health team from @entity1 and monitoring our woodlands closely			0
' but he warned : ' tracking the disease is going to be difficult with the imminent autumnal leaf fall , so the true extent of the disease in the @entity31 may be difficult to establish until the spring			0
' the @entity1 today announced that the fungus is being treated as a quarantine pest under national emergency measures and urged members of the public to report any suspected cases			1
the @entity1 has produced a pictorial guide to how to spot the disease			0
here are some of the signs :			0

ash dieback has been discovered at countryside sites in @entity11
@entity364 trees make up 30 per cent of the @entity31 's wooded landscape
@entity1 declares national emergency quarantine
@entity289 will ban ash imports on monday and introduce tight restrictions on movements of the tree around the country
