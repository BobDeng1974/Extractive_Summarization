by @entity0 and @entity1 this is @entity3 , a polar bear living in @entity5 who has been called the ‘ world ’s saddest animal ’			1
he sits in a concrete enclosure at @entity10 in @entity11 in temperatures of up to @entity13 ( @entity14 ) and is said to have been depressed since his long - term friend @entity15 died two years ago			1
it is claimed the 29 - year - old ’s lonely life is causing him to display abnormal behaviour , including tilting his head and showing his teeth while pacing back and forth and rocking from side to side			1
now , campaigners are worried that he is suffering mental health issues			2
@entity49 singer @entity48 , 68 , said on @entity50 : ‘ do n’t cry for him , @entity11 ? no tears of mrs @entity52 for tortured polar bear @entity3			1
your hands are stained with his blood when he dies			0
’ animal rights activists now want @entity3 - whose only access to cooling water in his enclosure is said to be a pool just 20in ( 50cm ) deep - moved to another zoo that offers cooler conditions			1
@entity62 blocked an effort five months ago to move @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66 - where a new international @entity67 is located , reported the @entity68			1
the zoo did not believe the bear would survive the two - day trip , with director @entity72 saying the medical board had made a decision - and officials were keen to ‘ avoid a big mistake ’			2
still in @entity11 : @entity62 blocked an effort five months ago to move @entity64 in @entity66 not going : @entity78 had gathered 160,000 signatures in a campaign to transfer @entity3 urgently to @entity66 , which it said has weather that more closely resembles what occurs in his natural habitat heavy : at @entity10 , @entity3 is served 33lbs ( 15kg ) of meat per day , and all the fruit and vegetables he can eat			1
and if his caretakers are late , @entity3 growls to draw their attention he added at the time that the bear was in ‘ good condition ’ , explaining that the life expectancy of one of the animals is just over 20 years - but in captivity , they can often live to see the age of 30			1
mr @entity72 said : ‘ we must avoid a big mistake , like his death during the trip or upon arrival			0
one must evaluate the risks carefully			0
he is old , and this would require many hours of anaesthesia			0
’ @entity78 had gathered 160,000 signatures in a campaign to transfer @entity3 urgently to @entity66 , which it said has weather that more closely resembles what occurs in his natural habitat			1
@entity11 professor @entity110 , who teaches at @entity111 in @entity65 , has written to her government and the @entity113 in @entity114 over the issue			0
she told the @entity116 last year : ‘ you can see he is going crazy			2
he moves the way polar bears do when they are suffering a lot of stress			0
sad case : @entity41 for @entity42 - has been at the zoo for two decades , and has had no contact with his own kind since @entity15 died			1
now , campaigners are worried that he is suffering mental health issues campaign : @entity49 singer @entity48 , 68 , said on @entity50 : ' do n't cry for him , @entity11 ? no tears of mrs @entity52 for tortured polar bear @entity3			1
your hands are stained with his blood when he dies ' ‘ he has been filmed rocking back and forth in a way that signals distress			0
it breaks my heart to see it			0
i know how hot summer is			0
there is no way for him to escape the heat			2
‘ he looks so sad			0
you can imagine a polar bear in the desert with a swimming pool 50cm deep			0
it ’s difficult to watch this poor animal suffering and in pain			0
’ @entity3 , a 900lb ( 400kg ) bear born in the @entity49 in 1985 , arrived in 1993 in @entity62 , a city of 120,000 at the foot of the @entity154 , known for its wine production			1
at @entity10 , @entity3 is served 33lbs ( 15kg ) of meat per day , and all the fruit and vegetables he can eat			1
and if his caretakers are late , @entity3 growls to draw their attention			1
as the zoo ’s mascot , he has an air - conditioned 375 sq ft ( 35 sq metre ) enclosure , a 5,400 sq ft ( 500 sq metre ) beach and a swimming pool in which his guards throw blocks of ice to keep it cool			1
a spokesman for @entity62 did not immediately respond to a @entity172 request for comment			0
update : july 22 , 2014 nine days after the story was published , the @entity175 in @entity176 has issued the following statement to @entity172 on behalf of the government of @entity62			0
it said : ‘ @entity3 the bear , which has recently received international media coverage , was born in captivity in @entity184 , in the @entity49 , and belongs to the fifth generation of a polar bear family born in captivity			2
@entity3 arrived to @entity62 in 1993 , as a companion for @entity15 , a polar bear already living at @entity62 zoo which later became its partner			1
they lived together for 19 years until @entity15 died recently in old age			1
‘ even though @entity3 is already 39 , and has significantly exceeded the maximum normal life expectancy of a bear , he is in a good state of health			1
he has a good appetite , can move around well and displays normal behaviour			2
‘ a few months ago , local and international environmental and ecological organisations focused their attention on the condition of this bear living in @entity204			2
this encouraged the provincial government to convene a specialised medical committee back in february in @entity62			0
‘ one of the issues evaluated by this committee was the possibility of transferring the animal to @entity66 , as one of the @entity214 had requested			0
the medical team that gathered in @entity216 advised against moving @entity3			2
the group , comprising veterinarians and specialists from @entity11 , @entity220 and @entity66 ( the latter via videoconference ) , determined at the time that the animal was in optimum conditions both physically and in terms of its behaviour , that the premises where it lives complies with all international standards and that , given its age , an imminent transfer would put his health at risk			2
‘ from the outset , the government of @entity62 has made clear that it would be willing to move the bear should it be necessary , as long as it would not affect its health			2
but the @entity240 ( based in @entity66 ) informed the government of @entity62 that @entity66 ´ s phytosanitary controls discourage any possible importation of polar bears into that country			0
it is also important to keep in mind that the northern hemisphere has native diseases that are not found in the south and that , in order to perform the necessary tests on the bear for the journey , they would have to sedate the animal , which would endanger its life			0
‘ furthermore , by late march , @entity257 ( @entity256 ) determined , following special tests carried out over several months , that @entity3 the bear is in good health and had suffered no mistreatment whatsoever at the @entity10			1
‘ with regard to @entity3 ’s enclosure , the medical committee of veterinary surgeons that convened in february stated that it meets international standards the guidelines of the @entity49 @entity268 ( @entity268 )			1
the committee had requested some improvements to the bear ’s living space to give @entity3 a better quality of life			1
following these suggestions , works were carried out on the site that were completed in april			0
these included installing improved cooling in its habitat , as well as providing better quality water for the basin			0
once the bear adapts to these changes , the enclosure will be enlarged by an additional 12 square metres			0
‘ the improvements included the installation of three pieces of equipment : a cooling device , equipment for heat extraction from the cave , and a thermostat to regulate the temperature inside the den. this enables the temperature of @entity3 ´ s cave to be adjusted between @entity297 and @entity298 , reducing the sudden temperature changes when the bear goes outside			1
‘ the government of @entity62 has reaffirmed its intention to respect national and international standards in animal care and preservation			0
@entity3 the bear shall stay in @entity62 on account of the firm decision taken by the medical committee and also because the investigations carried out have shown that the animal has suffered no mistreatment of any kind			2
on the contrary , it is in a good health and its habitat complies with international guidelines			0

@entity3 sits in concrete enclosure at @entity10 in *sweltering* heat
said to be depressed since long - term friend @entity15 died two years ago
29 - year - old 's lonely life is causing him to display ' abnormal behaviour '
campaigners including @entity48 have called for him to be moved elsewhere
