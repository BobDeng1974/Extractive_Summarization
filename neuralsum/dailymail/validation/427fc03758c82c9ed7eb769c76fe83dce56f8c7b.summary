marijuana is much stronger than it was three decades ago , experts have warned			1
scientists found cannabis smoked today has tripled in strength since the 1980s			1
marijuana now contains increasingly high concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity8 ) , the psychoactive compound which gives the ' high '			1
but concentrations of cannabidiol ( @entity14 ) , a lesser known compound that is being investigated for its medical proponents , but does not create a ' high ' , has gone down			2
samples also contained contaminants including bacteria , fungi , butane and heavy metals , scientists found			1
presenting his preliminary findings at the 249th @entity39 of the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , he found that marijuana has tripled in strength in the last 30 years			1
he said : ' we 've seen a big increase in marijuana potency compared to where it was 20 or 30 years ago			2
' i would say the average potency of marijuana has probably increased by a factor of three			0
' the average potencies of the samples he analysed was 20 per cent @entity8 , but he saw values close to 30 per cent , which he described as'huge '			2
he explained that 30 years ago , @entity8 levels in marijuana were well below 10 per cent			1
the @entity8 content of cannabis has tripled in some strains because producers have been cross-breeding them over the years as users demand stronger drugs , he said			2
he added that an unexpected consequence of the breeding was that many of the samples his lab tested contained little to no cbd			0
researchers are currently investigating @entity14 as a treatment for schizophrenia , @entity76 's disease and alzheimer 's disease , as well as anxiety and depression			0
but unlike @entity8 , @entity14 does n't get provide the same ' high ' , which is why it could be considered in treatments for children			2
extra potent : concentrations of marijuana 's active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity8 ) ( pictured ) have increased from less than 10 per cent in samples from the 1980s to up to 30 per cent in samples tested today dr @entity29 said he was shocked by the levels of contaminants in samples of marijuana producers had voluntarily sent to the lab for testing			1
he said : ' one thing that 's been surprising is the level of microbial contamination in marijuana			0
' ' many of the samples were covered in fungi or bacterial contaminants			0
' others had @entity102 , which are used to create marijuana extracts , and others had heavy metals			1
' this is n't necessarily a cause for alarm , but it could spark discussions on what are safe levels of contaminants			0
dr @entity29 said : ' it 's a natural product			0
there 's going to be microbial growth on it no matter what you do			0
' so the questions become : what 's a safe threshold ? and which contaminants do we need to be concerned about ? '			0

cannabis has tripled in strength in the last three decades , scientists warn
they analysed levels of tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity8 ) in marijuana
found @entity8 concentrations of 30 **%** , compared to 10 **%** three decades ago
scientists also discovered bacteria , fungi , butane and heavy metals in pot
