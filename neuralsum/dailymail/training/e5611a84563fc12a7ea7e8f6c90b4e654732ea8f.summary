the ‘ bespoke ’ course has been organised for the 31 - year - old @entity15 to give him an understanding of issues affecting farms and rural communities			1

’ the cost of the study and accommodation is being met privately , a @entity41 spokesman said yesterday			0
a spokesperson for the @entity96 added that ' there is currently no plan for prince @entity3 to stay at @entity83 during his studies '			2

critics , however , have accused the prince of being ‘ workshy ’ and derided that plan as little more than an extended gap year			0
