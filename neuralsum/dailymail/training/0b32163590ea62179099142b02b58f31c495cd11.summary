a tangled web we weave : an artist has created stunning designs using spiderwebs			0
@entity5 turns the intricate webs into beautiful pieces of art by mounting them on coloured glass when he finds a delicate web he begins by spraying it with a coloured paint and then places a varnished piece of glass behind it			1
once it has stuck firmly in place he coats the back of the glass in a dark colour and waits for it to dry , before selling the works to customers all over the world			2
the pieces measure between one inch and 30 inches in diameter and sell for up to Â£ 180			1
@entity5 said : ' i discovered that a local park that i was fond of visiting as a child held a variety of spiders in abundance			1
arachnid art : a work of art from a @entity56 spiderweb frozen in time : each of his works are unique and show the differences between spider species and their webs , which can vary between triangular , circular , and hexagonal shapes ' spider webs are beautiful and i thought if i could master the catching process , it would be worthwhile			2
' i find a nice web , evict the spider , spray the web with paint , spray the glass with varnish , bring the glass to the web and allow the web to bond with the varnish			2
' i then wait for it to dry and paint over the varnish with a color that contrasts with the spray paint used on the web			0
' at first , i only managed one good catch in 10 , now i get about nine out of 10 , it is something that i am still learning			0
' intricate : once it has stuck firmly in place @entity5 coats the back of the glass in a dark colour and waits for it to dry a @entity95 spiderweb			1
@entity5 always vacates the spider before he captures the web talented @entity5 has become so used to working with spiders he can tell what specific breed has created a web simply by looking at it , and has worked with more than 30 types			1
these range from the @entity105 - which produces a triangular shaped web - to the @entity107 , which sits in a tightly coiled web			0
' webs are quite recognisable to a trained eye and i have caught over two dozen different species , ' he said			2
' all spiders weave a web that is unique to the species , some of course are very similar and could be confused with another			0
' what i like most is the amazing architecture , beautiful design , perfect irregularity , resilience and strength , and the spiders themselves are awesome looking animals			0
' some , like the triangular web of @entity105 , are so distinct they would never be confused with another , but i recognise all my webs			0
each spider produces different types of webs , which @entity5 can recognise on sight magnificent : an @entity136 spider ( left ) and a @entity137 ( right )			1

@entity5 fixes the webs onto coloured glass
he uses different breeds of spider for different patterns
some of his pieces are up to 30 inches wide
