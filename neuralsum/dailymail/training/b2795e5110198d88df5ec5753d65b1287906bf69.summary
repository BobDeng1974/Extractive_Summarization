by @entity0 and @entity1 from weepy ballads to stirring instrumentals , many pieces of music have been described as powerful or moving			0
but now there ’s a musical instrument that actually generates power when it is played - and it could provide light in poor and remote communities			0
the percussion shaker , called @entity12 , generates electricity that can charge a phone , or power a lamp after just 12 minutes of movement			1
it has a usb port so that a lighting strip can be attached ( also pictured ) when @entity12 is shaken , a magnet moves backwards and forwards through the centre of a solenoid - a coil of copper wire			2
a current is induced in the loops of wire and each time the magnet slides through , it charges up a rechargeable battery			0
because the energy is stored , @entity12 can be played in the morning and the electricity generated , used later in the dark			1
around 12 minutes of shaking generates enough power to light someone ’s home for an hour			0
it is the brainchild of @entity45 , who has been a percussionist with dance band @entity47 for 15 years			1
she hopes her innovation - which she ’s raising money to put into production on crowd funding site @entity51 – will improves the lives of people in @entity55 , where three quarters of the population have no access to electricity			1
the heart - shaped instrument is full of beads that make a noise when shaken , but play an important electricity - generating role , as well as making noise			2
the motion forces a magnet to move through a copper coil to make a current , which charges up a battery			0
more than 12 minutes of shaking can light up someone ’s home for an hour			0
‘ i 've tested the prototype with a number of different communities in @entity55 and have proven it is incredibly useful to people			1
children , teachers and village elders have all embraced it , ’ she wrote on @entity51			2
the heart - shaped instrument is full of beads that make a noise when shaken , but also play an important electricity - generating role			2
it has been trialled in @entity55 ( pictured ) and its creator hopes @entity12 will let children do homework when it is dark and charge phones to connect families and communities a usb port on the side of the @entity12 allows people to charge a mobile phone or plug in a lamp , and during tests in @entity55 , this proved to be safer than using a kerosene lamp			1
‘ during testing , the people who used @entity12 said it was useful because they had light in the evenings which they used for doing homework , household chores and for lighting their way home in the dark , ’ @entity45 continued			1
‘ @entity12 will enable children and their families to be safer by eliminating the need of kerosene for light for example , and by providing light for women and girls in areas where rape is a huge problem			0
’ the design is based on the shape of a heart , but it gets its geometric look because @entity45 was also inspired by flint stones , which are used to create a spark and ‘ give birth to a powerful new source of energy			0
' so far , just over half of the money required to ship 1,000 @entity12 to @entity55 has been raised and people can buy t - shirts , tickets to a special @entity47 concert as well as a @entity12 assembly kit , for £ 150 , which will be manufactured next year .			1

called @entity12 , the shaker was created by @entity138 musician @entity45
it has been tested in *locations* in @entity55 that do *n't* have adequate electricity
instrument is a prototype and is *due* to ship to *customers* in *october*
the @entity47 percussionist is raising funding for the *device* on @entity51
