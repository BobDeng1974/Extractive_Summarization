by @entity0 a schoolboy who was teased when he failed to light a fire on a @entity4 trip decided to build one in his garden - and sparked a £ 10,000 blaze which left him in hospital			1
@entity10 , 14 , hoped to prove himself to his friends by stacking up wood in the garden of his family home in @entity15 , @entity16 , and dousing it with petrol as his mother took his brother to school			1
armed with a camera phone to capture the moment , he put a match to the pile but watched in horror as flames leapt onto spread to his father , @entity28 ’s , shed			1
aftermath : @entity10 was treated at the specialist burns unit at the @entity31 in @entity32 after burning himself in a fire he set this picture , taken through a neighbour 's window , shows the scale of the fire the schoolboy started it contained two explosive gas canisters , and as @entity10 frantically tried to empty it , a petrol can exploded , soaking him as he stamped down the flames			1
the fire spread up from his feet , engulfing his clothes and body before blistering his hands and face			1
the schoolboy tried to put out the flames by rolling on the ground as neighbours raced to throw wet blankets over him and called emergency services			0
@entity10 was taken to hospital suffering superficial burns to his face , and is now waiting to hear if he will need a skin graft for a bad burn to his thumb			1
the fire wrecked the home - made shed where site manager mr @entity10 , 48 , kept his expensive tools and garden equipment , causing £ 10,000 damage			1
scout @entity10 , 14 , built a large fire in his parents ' garden in @entity15 , @entity16 , but ended up in hospital with severe burns @entity10 said : ' i just remember thinking , i need to put out the fire and i need to get the tools and gas out of the shed			1
' apparently i was shouting , but i could n’t feel anything , i was just panicking and did n’t realise how badly i was burnt			0
' neighbour @entity81 , 74 , said he heard @entity10 shouting ' help me , help , i ’m on fire ' and called the fire brigade			2
the schoolboy 's mother , @entity84 , 49 , a party planner , said : ' i abandoned my car and sprinted up the road , screaming for @entity10			1
' the first i saw him he was on a stretcher ready to be wheeled all the way down the road to the ambulance because it could n’t get to the house			0
' i was so frightened , i felt like i was going to collapse			0
all i could hear was @entity10 saying ‘ @entity94 , help me , please help me ’			0
' she added : ' this all came about because those @entity4 teased him when he could n’t get his fire going			1
' he just wanted to show them he could light one , bless him			2
unfortunately i think he went a bit too far			0
' the firefighters said to us the two gas canisters still in the shed were seconds off exploding from the heat and if they had , @entity10 might not be here today			2
' to be honest , @entity10 was n’t thinking about himself , he was more worried about how angry his dad would be that the outhouse he built from scratch , and all his tools , had been destroyed			2
up in smoke : the wooden shed , hand - built by @entity10 's father , contained tools worth £ 10,000 @entity10 was badly burnt as he tried to save the contents of the shed , and may need a skin graft on his thumb @entity10 's mother , @entity84 , 49 , said she sprinted to the house to see her son being carried out on a stretcher ' but at the end of the day they ’re replaceable , my son is n’t and i ’m just so happy and relieved that he is alive			1
' firefighters were delayed in tackling the blaze because double - parking in the @entity125 prevented them from getting their vehicles near enough , forcing them to lay out hoses first			0
@entity10 was taken to @entity128 , before being transferred to the specialist burns unit at the @entity31 in @entity32			2
doctors say the burns on his face are likely to heal , but he may need a skin graft on a bad burn to his thumb			1
