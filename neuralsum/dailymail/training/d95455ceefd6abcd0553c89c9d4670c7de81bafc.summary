a dog that nearly chewed her legs off after a cruel owner strung her up by her hindquarters for three days is recovering with new owners in @entity6			1
@entity7 , a collie - @entity10 @entity9 cross , was gagged , hung upside down by her back legs and left for dead by her previous owner in @entity13			1
her rear legs were so tightly bound the rope had cut through her flesh , and she had desperately gnawed her own legs to the bone in an attempt to free herself			0
after being strung up by her hind legs , @entity7 is now expected to make a full recovery from her horrific injuries how she was found : the two - year - old had been strung up with rope and left upside down for three days @entity25 , a @entity6 animal charity , heard of the two - year - old ’s plight from local contacts and sent a team to save her			1
vets told them her injuries suggested she had been left hanging by her hind legs upside down for three days before being dumped in a garden , where she was found			1
@entity7 then had three leg operations in @entity13 as well as treatment for a uterus infection			2
she was then fostered by @entity38 and @entity39 from @entity40			2
she has since been given a permanent home in @entity42 and is expected to make a full recovery			0
offshore engineer mr @entity44 , 39 , said : ' we were warned she may have been traumatised by her experiences and could have emotional issues , but nothing could be further from the truth			0
' @entity7 is living proof of the resilience and forgiving nature of dogs - her only scars are physical and those are healing very well			0
' one upsetting aspect of this is that knowing @entity7 as we do now , it is very likely that her tail was still wagging when those people were doing those terrible things to her			0
' i do n’t think she is capable of seeing the bad in people			0
' post-op : the dog was saved by @entity6 animal charity , @entity25 , and brought to start a new life in the @entity6 road to recovery : @entity7 's new owners says she is a happy , trusting dog who only sees the good in people			1
