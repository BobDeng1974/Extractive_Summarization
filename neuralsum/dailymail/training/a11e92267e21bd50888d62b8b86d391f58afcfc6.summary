killed : the family of lance corporal @entity1 , who was killed by a mob in @entity3 , said it ' beggared belief ' that @entity6 is withholding the 150 letters and calls discussing their plans to go to war in 2003 families of @entity12 troops killed in @entity3 reacted angrily to the news that the @entity6 inquiry will not publish the full exchanges between @entity16 and @entity17			1
they said the agreement to include only quotes or ' gists ' of the messages and conversations meant they would never learn the full truth about the decision to go to war			2
@entity27 , whose 20 - year - old son @entity28 @entity1 was one of six @entity29 killed by a mob in @entity3 in 2003 , said it ‘ beggared belief ’ that mr @entity16 and mr @entity17 were being allowed to ‘ get away with it ’			1
he said inquiry chairman sir @entity33 would have his hands tied by the failure to get permission to publish the classified documents in full			1
mr @entity1 , 62 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , said : ' i 'm not happy with it at all			2
i want to know the reason why my son gave his life for his country			1
' i do n’t want the “ gist ” of it			2
i want the whole truth and nothing but the truth			0
‘ this is n’t some minor bit of legislation going through @entity54 like the fox - hunting bill			0
' we need all the details that led up to the war , which was a war of option , not necessity			0
‘ @entity54 has been misled , the general public have been misled , but worst of all those troops have been misled			0
‘ we need to see the full story			0
it is very , very important as part of closure for those who have lost loved ones			0
' and there are also people who have been maimed , crippled or blinded – they may want to know why they sustained those injuries			0
‘ if there is nothing to hide , why hide it ? if @entity17 is so proud of what he did , release all the documents			1
’ secrets : the hold up in the publication of the @entity6 report is down to a disagreement over what can be published from the notes and conversations between @entity17 and @entity16 in the run up to the war @entity87 , 50 , from @entity88 , whose son @entity89 , 19 , was killed in @entity3 in 2004 , told the @entity90 the relatives of those who died were disappointed by the decision and now felt they would not get to the truth about why mr @entity16 took @entity12 to war			1
' now a lot of families think : “ what was the point ? what is going to be the outcome ? is it just going to be covered up now ? ” ' i think they should be released for the families to see them , because we ’re going to wonder for the rest of our lives what was in it			2

inquiry chairman sir @entity33 will hold back *leaders* ' 150 secret calls
families said it ' beggared belief ' that @entity17 and @entity16 can ' get away with it '
one mother whose son , 19 , was killed in @entity3 said ' let families see them '
