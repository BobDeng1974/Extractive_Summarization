by @entity0 scientists are gearing up for fierce solar storms next year by setting up a worldwide chain of monitoring stations to study the so - called ' solar maximum '			1
massive increases in the numbers of sunspots are expected to cause changes in the @entity11 's ionosphere , the shell of plasma at the top of our atmosphere			1
there are fears because the current generation of satellite navigation technology has never experience a ' solar max ' , and changes in the ionosphere could cause problems with gps and other signals from space			1
@entity28 spots are seen as the moon moves into a full eclipse position seen in the @entity31 in may : late summer will see the @entity28 reach the maximum point of its 11 - year cycle , resulting in an increase in such activity activity increasing : this graph shows how solar and geomagnetic indices are on the rise again after a lull following the last solar max. sun spot levels are shown in orange ; solar flux levels , showing total energy output , are green ; geomagnetic indices tracking magnetic storm levels around @entity11 are in blue and pink discovered by 20th - century radio pioneers who bounced long - wave radio signals off it , the ionosphere is a layer of electrically charged particles strongly influenced by the @entity28 with the coming of the @entity56 , radio signals started passing through the ionosphere to and from orbiting satellites and today everyday life is more reliant than ever on these space systems			1
during solar maximum , large numbers of sunspots appear and the sun 's irradiance output grows by about 0.1 per cent , with the increased energy output thought to affect global climate and weather patterns			2
the ionosphere becomes most turbulent as the @entity28 ’s warming thickens it , and then again in the evening as cooling leads to turbulence – including the production of ' plasma bubbles '			1
@entity28 's impact on the ionosphere : it becomes most turbulent as the @entity75 s heat thickens it , and again in the evening it cools			1
the state of the ionosphere is often measured in terms of @entity80 the effect on radio systems includes signal delay – a major problem factor for satnav , where ranging is based on timing accurate to a billionth of a second – and signal - scattering ‘ scintillations ’ rendering the signal unstable			1
to monitor the effects of the solar max on @entity11 's upper atmosphere and the consequences for satellite navigation and communications , the @entity89 is setting up a worldwide chain of monitoring stations			2
' the current monitor network is still being developed but has already been detecting mild ionospheric storms , ' said @entity100 , the scientist in charge of the project			0
monitor station based in @entity104 , @entity105 : the station 's task is to pick up gps signals more accurately than usual and take note of signal delays or scintillations to observe disturbances in the ionosphere network : the @entity89 has set up sensor stations across the planet , paying particular attention to the equator where the interference in the ionosphere is expected to be highest the solar maximum is the period of greatest solar activity in the @entity28 's 11 - year cycle			1
the @entity28 's magnetic field lines are the most distorted at this time due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles			1
this causes large numbers of sunspots appear , and the @entity28 's irradiance output grows by about 0.1 per cent			1
the increased energy output of solar maxima can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns			0
the solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next , with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle			1
large solar flares often occur during a maximum			0
for example , the @entity148 struck the @entity11 with such intensity the northern lights could be seen as far south as @entity152			0
the last solar maximum was in 2000			0
in 2006 @entity154 initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011 , and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958			0
however , more recent projections say the maximum should arrive in autumn of 2013 and be the smallest sunspot cycle since 1906			1
monitor stations work by measuring variations in gps signals with greater accuracy than existing systems			0
' we are placing sensor stations around the globe , but the vicinity of the equator is a particular focus of interest , ' added dr @entity100			0
' it exhibits much more dynamic behaviour than the mid-latitudes so we have established stations at @entity175 off @entity176 and @entity104 , @entity105 , on the other side of the continent			0
' in addition , through a deal with @entity181 space agency @entity180 , we will have access to stations hosted by existing tracking sites at @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 in the @entity190 , the latter site being where the magnetic equator diverts from the geographic equator			2
' further sensor stations under consideration are @entity195 in the @entity196 and @entity197 in @entity198			0
' stations in @entity200 and @entity201 in the @entity202 , provide high - latitude coverage			2
' at solar maximum , the @entity28 's magnetic field lines are the most distorted due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles			2
the solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next , with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle			2
large solar flares often occur during a maximum			0
for example , the @entity148 struck the @entity11 with such intensity that the northern lights could be seen as far south as @entity152 , approximately 42 ° north of the equator .			0

the @entity28 reaches the most active period of its 11 - year cycle in summer 2013
increases in the number of sunspots will cause changes in the ionosphere that could interfere with radio **transmissions** from space
@entity234 relies on **transmissions** timed to the split - second , and there are fears the interference could case serious problems with navigation
