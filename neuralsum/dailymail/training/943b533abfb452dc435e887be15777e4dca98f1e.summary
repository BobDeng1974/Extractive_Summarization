i 've worked around politics and politicians for more than 25 years			2
and i thought i 'd seen it all when it comes to political cynicism			2
look at the long view and all the parties are as bad as each other , making promises they know ca n't be delivered or pledges they 've no intention of honouring			1
but in nearly three decades of following politics , for sheer shameless , dishonourable and downright nasty cynicism , nothing i 've encountered comes close to @entity16 's promise yesterday that for anyone with suspected cancer , under a @entity20 they will be able to ' go to the @entity21 and within a week you get both the test and the result '			1
to read his interview , it was almost as if he was claiming a @entity29 would be able to cure cancer in a week : criticised : @entity31 says that in three decades of following politics , for sheer shameless , dishonourable and downright nasty cynicism , nothing he encountered comes close to @entity16 's cancer results promise ' one in three of us is going to get cancer during our lifetime – that 's incredibly scary , ' he said			1
' it 's a massive killer			2
the number of people waiting more than six weeks has doubled – we are talking about millions of people each year			2
this will make a big difference to patients			2
' except , of course , that the idea of a cancer test – any one test that can tell you ' yes ' or ' no ' – is utter nonsense			1
it 's not just a false hope that he is holding out ; it 's a shameful piece of political posturing designed solely to boost @entity20 's poll rating without any basis in medicine or reality			1
we 'll come to the specifics of his cynicism in a moment			2
but here 's my context			2
the reason the @entity74 's pledge so disgusts me is that it is personal			0
just under two years ago i was diagnosed with leukaemia			0
so , i know exactly what it means as a patient to be told that cancer is suspected , and then to have to go though the agonising waits involved			1
anyone who has cancer will tell you that it 's not just one wait , it 's several			1
and while the jaw - dropping inefficiency of the @entity89 certainly prolongs those waits , even in mr @entity16 's fantasy world where the @entity89 could do everything at the drop of a hat , waiting would be inevitable			1
because there is no one , single cancer test			1
there are many , of varying degrees of nastiness – just like cancers themselves			0
cynical : @entity16 has chosen to make the centrepiece of his campaign on the @entity89 , one of the core issues of the @entity107 , a pledge on cancer that is essentially nonsense , according to @entity31 my own diagnosis was both fortunate and farcical			1
as i have a form of arthritis , i have to have steroid injections			0
after one , my brilliant gp looked at the blood tests that were part of the procedure and sniffed that something was n't quite right			1
she sent me to a haematologist , who in turn sent me off to have a series of further blood tests			2
looking back , i now think it 's funny that she had the worst bedside manner imaginable			0
i saw her again when the results came back from the lab , and without looking up from her notes she uttered a sentence i will never forget : ' the tests show that you have either the after - effects of a virus or a form of leukaemia			1
' with hindsight , i was clearly an idiot because throughout the process to date the c - word never crossed my mind			0
i had been feeling run down and tired for years but thought it nothing other than the result of working long hours and having two toddlers			0
so when she said ' leukaemia ' i was poleaxed			0
i needed more blood tests after some time had passed to see if a diagnosis was possible			2
then , after these came through , she gave me the news : it was indeed ' a form of leukaemia ' and i needed to see a consultant			0
when i saw him , he ordered yet another round of blood tests			2
so much for mr @entity16 's idea of one test			1
when these results came through , i was told i needed to have a sample of blood and bone scraped from my spine			2
i will spare you the full details			0
suffice to say that no local anaesthetic is possible at the immediate place of incision , so the pain is , well , serious			0
the surgeon told me they only ever make two attempts to do the procedure in one session because it is so painful			0
even if there was one overall cancer test that could be delivered within a week , it would be pointless without an @entity89 able to deliver the right care they made an exception in my case – the house doctor was so incompetent that after five attempts she had still not got what was needed , before finally consenting to get the registrar			1
on his first go ( and my sixth ) he managed it perfectly			0
then , finally , after four blood tests and a bungled procedure , the consultant was able to give me a full diagnosis , a month after my gp 's initial concern			1
even if the bone test had been carried out flawlessly , the process could not have been anything other than drawn out and ambiguous			0
and for good measure , when the consultant then tried to see when my leukaemia had actually developed by looking at the records of four previous operations i 'd had over the past decade , not one of the four different hospitals – not one – could lay their hands on records they were supposed to have kept			0
so no one has any idea if i 've had leukaemia for two years or 20			0
seven days to find out if we have cancer , mr @entity16 ? what disgusting cynicism			1
it is possible , i concede , that i am doing the @entity20 leader a disservice			1
perhaps he does n't actually know that this is how cancer diagnosis really happens , and that he 's not being deliberately cynical			2
perhaps , in other words , he 's just being an idiot			0
not exactly a comforting thought about a man who could be prime minister next year , is it ? but given his track record , i 've no doubt that it 's naked cynicism			0
in july , mr @entity16 gave a little - noticed speech about political cynicism			1
according to him , what really threatens to stop @entity20 winning next year is n't the @entity233 – it 's cynicism			1
he said : ' the belief that nobody can make a difference			0
that all politics is the same … they believe we value posturing more than principle			0
good photos or soundbites more than a decent policy			0
' ignore the breathtaking hypocrisy of such a speech from a man whose most stupid mistake so far was to forget to talk about the deficit in his party conference speech – a mistake that happened because he cared so much about his image that he chose to speak without any notes			0
just think about this weekend 's announcement in that context			0
mr @entity16 has chosen to make the centrepiece of his campaign on the @entity89 , one of the core issues of the @entity107 , a pledge on cancer that is essentially nonsense – based neither on medical reality nor patient need			1
even if there was one overall cancer test that could be delivered within a week , it would be pointless without an @entity89 able to deliver the right care			1
but instead of focusing on a decent policy , as he put it in that speech , he is the one who is focused on posturing more than principle			0
@entity20 has a 12 - point lead over the @entity275 on the @entity89 – and mr @entity16 will do anything he can to keep the issue alive as one of the key battlegrounds of the @entity107			1
even if it means making cynical promises that leave this cancer patient simply nauseated .			1

@entity16 criticised for promising @entity20 would speed up cancer tests
has been *accused* of making pledges he has no intention of honouring
@entity20 leader yesterday said anyone who suspects they have cancer will be given results of tests within one week of first seeing their gp
