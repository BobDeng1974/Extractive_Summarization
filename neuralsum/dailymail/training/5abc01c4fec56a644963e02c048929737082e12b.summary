far beyond the orbit of @entity3 , trillions of comets left over from the formation of the solar system lie in wait in a region known as the @entity9 cloud			1
here they are kept in relatively stable orbits around the sun , posing little threat to @entity14 save for the occasional icy rock that ventures inwards			0
but in the blink of a cosmic eye that could all change , as stars have been found that could pass near our solar system in 240,000 years - and it they might shower us with thousands of deadly comets			1
a scientist from the @entity27 in @entity28 says a star could have a closer encounter with @entity14 ' soon ' - in cosmic terms			1
dr @entity32 says there is a 90 % chance one will come within 0.6 light - years of @entity14 in 500,000 years			1
this could send comets towards our planet ( illustrated ) according to dr @entity32 from the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity28 , there are several stars that could pose a danger to our solar system			1
as our sun performs its cosmic dance around the @entity48 , it comes closer to and further from other stars in the vicinity			0
the star of most danger is @entity53 , a star slightly smaller than our sun that has a 90 per cent chance of coming between 0.13 and 0.65 light - years of @entity14 in 240,000 to 470,000 years			1
the @entity9 cloud is a vast and mysterious region that is thought to surround our solar system			2
it contains trillions of comets left over from the birth of the universe - and possibly larger objects like dwarf planets as well			0
it begins at about 0.08 light - years from the sun - 170 times the orbit of @entity3 - and extends out to about 0.8 light - years			0
occasionally , comets from the region make their way into the solar system , known as long - period comets			1
one of the most famous this year was comet @entity74 , which brushed past @entity75 on 19 october			0
however , apart from these brief visitors , not much is known about the @entity9 cloud			0
it has never been directly observed , and it is not exactly known how large it is - although it is thought to define the gravitational influence of the sun. this may sound distant , but considering the @entity9 cloud extends to about 0.8 light - years , it is clearly too close for comfort			2
dr @entity32 says an approaching star could disturb this region and be a threat to @entity14			1
‘ stars which pass close to the sun can perturb the @entity9 cloud , injecting comets into the inner solar system where they may collide with the @entity14 , ’ he wrote in his paper			1
he used data from @entity98 ’s @entity97 spacecraft , which scanned the sky in the 1990s , to study the future of 50,000 stars			0
the possibility that an incoming star could disturb the @entity9 cloud in such a way to threaten the planets has been known for a while			0
but this is one of the most accurate estimates yet for when and where a star will actually approach the solar system			1
it should be noted that the position and motion of @entity53 may be incorrect , meaning it will not pass so close			0
but even so , there are other stars that will take its place			0
a dwarf called @entity120 , for example , has a 90 per cent chance of coming within 0.3 to 1.4 light - years in 1.3 million years			1
the @entity9 cloud ( illustrated ) is a vast and mysterious region that is thought to surround our solar system			2
it contains trillions of comets left over from the birth of the universe - and possibly larger objects like dwarf planets as well			0
long - period comets originate here , while short - period comets come from the @entity135 speaking to @entity137 , dr @entity32 said that while the star could come close in cosmic terms , it might not be obviously noticeable to our distant descendants			1
in addition , he says the process through which comets are sent into the solar system will take millions of years , and will likely increase the current rate of 10 or so comets a year to a hundred			1
‘ if there are people around at that time in the future and they look up in the night sky , they would n’t particularly notice the star , ’ he explained			0
‘ calculation of one object suggests it would be slightly brighter than @entity159 , which is pretty bright , but not as bright as the moon or sun or anything			0
’ but he says such an encounter is ‘ inevitable , ’ although the chances of a star actually entering the solar system is close to zero			1
using @entity97 data , dr @entity32 has been able to look forward and back in to the future about 20 million years			2
with data from the @entity172 spacecraft , however , he hopes to extend this to about 50 million years - which will likely reveal more stars that once encountered our solar system , or will do in the future			1
dr @entity32 used data from @entity98 ’s @entity97 spacecraft , shown left , which scanned the sky in the 1990s , to study the future of 50,000 stars			0
he plans to use data from the @entity172 spacecraft ( illustrated right ) in 2016 to create even more accurate models of future and past stellar encounters with @entity14 it 's believed that a stellar encounter in the past may have caused comets to come towards @entity14 , possibly even causing the rock that killed the dinosaurs ( illustration shown ) to hit our planet			2
dr @entity32 hopes to use data to look ' back in time ' and see if this is true it is not just a disturbance in the @entity9 cloud that would threaten life on @entity14 , but also radiation from the stars themselves			2
‘ if intense enough - and in particular if the star turned supernova during an encounter - then such ionising radiation could kill organisms outright , erode the @entity14 ’s ozone layer to expose life to harmful solar uv radiation , or induce long - term global calling through the nitrogen dioxide produced in our atmosphere , ’ wrote dr @entity32			1
he notes that there are several events throughout history that have been linked to cosmic events			0
the mass extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , for example , was almost certainly formed by some form of large impact			2
a layer of iron - 60 radioisotopes deposited at the bottom of the ocean 2.8 million years ago , meanwhile , is suspected to be the result of a nearby supernova			1
and other nearby supernova have been blamed for more mass extinctions on @entity14			0
dr @entity32 says to truly know how much danger we will be in , though , more data is needed			0
this will hopefully be returned by @entity98 ’s @entity172 spacecraft in 2016 , which is currently mapping one billion stars in the @entity48 - one per cent of its total stars			0
and he also wants to use the data to look backwards in time , and see if any craters on @entity14 could be explained by close passes of stars .			2

a scientist from the @entity27 in @entity28 says a star could have a ' close ' encounter with @entity14 in as soon as a *quarter* of a million years
dr @entity256 said the closest approaching star has a 90 % chance of coming within 0.6 light years of @entity14 in 500,000 years
other stars could also come close in 240,000 to 470,000 years
this could disturb the orbits of comets - sending them towards @entity14
radiation from a star could also kill organisms if it went supernova during the approach - although none such have been found yet
but he says the event of a star having a close encounter with our solar system - even if it does *n't* explode - is ' inevitable ' at some point
