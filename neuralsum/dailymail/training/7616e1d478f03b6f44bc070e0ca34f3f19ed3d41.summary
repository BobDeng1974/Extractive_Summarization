this is the @entity1 's song , pinging out contended chirrups into deep space			1
the haunting sounds have been captured by @entity6 's twin @entity7 ( @entity9 ) satellite , which launched on august 30 this year			2
the satellites captured the chirping and whistling radio waves emitted by @entity1 ’s magnetosphere on september 5			2
the sound is known as ' @entity1 's chorus ' and can be heard by human ears - that is , assuming you could take your helmet off while floating in space			1
@entity21 , from the @entity22 , is the principal investigator of the @entity24 and @entity23 and @entity25 ( @entity26 ) instruments on - board the satellites			2
the sounds of @entity1 : as charged solar particles hit the inner and outer radiation belts around our planet , they get caught and whipped around , emitting the sounds which you can hear below he said : ' people have known about chorus for decades			1
' radio receivers are used to pick it up , and it sounds a lot like birds chirping			0
' it was often more easily picked up in the mornings , which along with the chirping sound is why it ’s sometimes referred to as " dawn chorus "			0
' the radio waves are at frequencies which can be heard from the human ear , but sadly you might need to be in space and without a helmet - which is not medically advisable			2
you might also encounter the tricky problem of sound not travelling through the vacuum			0
the sounds are emitted by energetic particles in the upper levels of @entity1 ’s magnetosphere , before they get whipped around by the radiation belts circling the @entity1			1
the satellites trail each other around the @entity1 in elliptical orbits - sometimes as low as 375 miles about the ground , other times up to 20,000 miles above us			1
they are aiming to study the @entity73 belts that circle the @entity1 , in particular the various particles that make up the radiation belts			1
the @entity73 belts are streams of particles , which arrive in @entity1 's vicinity from the solar winds and get caught in @entity1 's magnetic field			1
@entity80 , the deputy project scientist at @entity81 , said : ' if you imagine having two buoys in the ocean , and one goes up , and comes down again , you do n't know anything about what caused that to go up and down , ' if both of them go up , then you know you 've got a very big feature that is affecting both of them at the same time			0
if you one goes up , then the other goes up , you can measure how fast that wave has traveled between them , and what direction it 's going into			0
' and if only one goes up and comes down again , then you 've got a very , very localised feature that did n't travel anywhere			0
' so in order to be able to really understand what is going on , these very fine - scale features in our radiation belts , we have two spacecraft to do that			0
' there is poetic justice - or more likely intent - in @entity111 heading up the research at the @entity22 - as that is where @entity73 first studied the belts in the 1950s .			0

@entity1 's magnetic belt - capturing solar winds particles - sends out songs into deep space
