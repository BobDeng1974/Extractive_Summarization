by @entity0 there 's a picture buried in my family photo album that makes me recoil in horror			1
it shows a dowdy woman squinting uncertainly at the camera , her matronly @entity11 floral dress and frizzy perm clearly doing nothing for either her figure or her self - confidence			1
but this picture is n’t of an elderly aunt or frumpy family friend — it ’s me , at a 21st birthday party in 1990			2
yes , at a time when i should have been looking my most youthful and radiant , i was more middle - aged than i am now — lamb dressed as mutton , if you will — and sadly i remained that way for the next 20 years			1
@entity25 dressed as mutton : on her 21st birthday @entity0 looked more middle - aged than she does now it ’s only now , aged 45 , that i am finally at ease with how i look			1
in fact , i ’m regularly mistaken for a younger woman , thanks to a wardrobe stuffed with skinny jeans and fitted jackets from fashion - forward stores such as @entity36 , @entity37 and teenager ’s favourite @entity36			2
i even have a trendy gamine haircut			0
in many ways , it seems , i ’ve actually aged backwards			2
and i ’m not alone : something dramatic has happened to older women like me who , according to a recent survey of 2,000 adults , commissioned by healthcare provider @entity47 , believe middle age begins at 53			1
armed with a disposable income and constantly bombarded with images of eternally youthful stars such as @entity53 ( muttony at 20 , foxy at 40 ) we ’ve gritted our teeth and made the best of ourselves			1
perhaps it ’s the sudden shock of the first wrinkle or , conversely , the growing confidence to take risks that sees so many of us deciding to defer growing old : a last - ditch attempt to recapture the youth that ’s slowly slipping out of our grasp			2
ageing in reverse : aged 45 @entity0 is finally at ease with how she looks , and feels younger than ever the once - frumpy , now never - badly dressed @entity69 seemed to have a style revelation at a similar age			1
when she finally left behind the cropped hair and combat pants she was once known for , and started turning up to red carpet events in slinky @entity75 in 2004 , she explained her transformation : ‘ i will be 45 years old this year and i do n’t have many more years left to be glamorous			2
’ buying online and easy returns have also eroded the middle - aged woman ’s bugbear of communal changing rooms , with their unforgiving , unflatteringly lit mirrors			1
no wonder recent figures showed 86 per cent of women aged 45 to 54 had made at least one online fashion purchase in the past six months , and more of us than ever are shopping in trendy ‘ youth ’ stores such as @entity36 and @entity88			1
@entity90 : actress @entity69 has left behind her days of cropped hair and combat pants compare that with my 20s , when my achingly earnest generation of women were so desperate to be taken seriously that we saw fashion as frivolous and deemed not making an effort to be ‘ cool ’			1
and since the generation before us — who had been born in the post-war @entity105 — had barely experienced teenage years , far less the middle youth that now keeps adults in semi-adolescence until they are almost 50 , no precedent had been set for anything other than sensible dressing from 21 onwards			1
my mum , @entity111 , was typical			0
a radiographer from @entity113 who stopped working when my older sister , @entity115 , and i were born in her early 20s , she had a pathological fear of looking like mutton dressed as lamb			1
she refused to wear ‘ denim jeans ’ after the age of 30 for the same reason , and i absorbed her values			2
so it ’s no surprise that i have another picture of me , a year after leaving @entity126 , in my first job as a reporter , wearing a russet trouser suit from @entity130 that completely drowns my 25 - year - old figure and looks at least two sizes too big			2
my day - to - day working wardrobe was usually bought at middle - aged favourites such as @entity135 , @entity136 or , if i was pushing the boat out , principles and @entity11			1
my casual style was no better : it consisted of baggy sweatshirts and shapeless jeans and my make - up regime was nothing but mascara and lipstick			1
no wonder i once suffered the indignity of having a taxi driver mistake me for my friend ’s mother , accompanying her to a university open day			0
and it ’s just as well i was focused on my studies as i doubt i was turning many heads			0
somehow , in my mid- 30s , i finally found a man willing to look past my shoulder pads and knee - length skirts			2
my husband , @entity159 , a children ’s author , 45 , professes , typically , that he did n’t notice what i was wearing unless it was short			2
getting shirty : a wardrobe stuffed with skinny jeans and fitted shirts and jackets has seen @entity0 go from frumpy to foxy shopping for a wedding dress took me inside high - end designer shops and department stores for the first time , but these sartorial stirrings were put on hold again between the ages of 35 and 39 , when i was either pregnant with my son , @entity174 , now eight , and my twins , @entity176 and @entity177 , six , or in a sleep - deprived fog			1
but then , suddenly , everything changed			0
my eldest started school and the younger two began sleeping through the night			0
i remember standing in front of the mirror , in cords and a sweatshirt , meeting my reflection ’s eyes and realising that i ’d spent my entire life on my career and nurturing others			0
two billion t - shirts are sold around the world each year i suddenly wanted to be frivolous for the first time			0
i was 42 by the time my twins started school and , faced with 20 - something mums in the playground , i was determined never to be mistaken for their granny			0
slowly , i weaned myself off @entity198 clothes , got my hair cut and dyed , and dared to reveal a figure honed by years of pushing a double buggy			0
i still remember the outfit that really ignited my passion for fashion , which i bought in upmarket @entity205 , in @entity206 : a leopard - print wrap dress from @entity208 , a fur - collared camel coat from @entity210 and a pair of nude heels from @entity213			0
when i walked down the street , i felt more youthful and sexy than i ever did in my 20s and i think i may even have detected a wolf whistle			0
suddenly , i had time to read fashion magazines and tear my eyes away from my children long enough to notice what was in shop windows			0
i ask myself if @entity222 would wear any item i pick up , and if the answer is yes , i put it back on the rack i learnt that you can never have too many coats or shoes as the first impression you give is usually outdoors , and to update classic outfits every season with on - trend accessories			0
after a few years , it finally dawned on me that you ca n’t buy cheap in your 40s and are better served for basics in higher - end @entity239 stores such as @entity240 and @entity208 , and that a new level of grooming is essential so as not to look old and unkempt			0
i even devised the ‘ @entity222 rule ’ — never mind @entity53 , who revealed last week that whenever she has a style dilemma , she wonders : ‘ what would @entity248 do ? ’ i ask myself if @entity222 [ speaker ’s wife and former @entity252 contestant ] would wear any item i pick up , and if the answer is yes , i put it back on the rack			0
all that said , i do feel wistful when i look at my children and realise that , thanks to fast , disposable fashion and the ever - increasing pressure to conform — now constantly policed by social media — the carefree days when image did n’t matter are over			1
after all , how can you make fashion mistakes and truly learn your own style if you do n’t get it wrong from time to time ? even if it is in a flowery @entity11 frock .			0

aged 21 , @entity0 dressed more middle - aged than she does now at 45
the once - frumpy @entity69 had a style revelation at the same age
disposable income has led to a dramatic change amongst older women ,
new survey results show middle age begins at 53
