by @entity1 reporter published : 11:53 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 19 january 2013 an earthquake hit @entity3 in @entity4 giving residents an early morning shock			2
the tremor measured 2.9 magnitude and was recorded by the @entity11 - based @entity10 @entity9 at 5.20am			1
the quake occurred yesterday at a depth of 13km and was said to have been felt by residents over a wide area including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
where the earthquake struck : residents in @entity3 in @entity4 got a shock movement : the tremor measured 2.9 magnitude and was recorded by the @entity11 - based @entity10 @entity9 at 5.20am yesterday one resident in @entity27 , @entity4 , told @entity17 : ‘ it lasted at least 20 seconds and some dvds fell off a shelf in my room			1
’ another caller , from @entity17 , said : ‘ it sounded like an underground train coming and everything wobbled , but nothing fell off shelves			1
’ it was a million times weaker than the 8.9 earthquake which struck off the @entity40 coast , causing a devastating tsunami in march 2011			1
on monday the old mining area of @entity43 in @entity44 was also hit by a smaller quake - its second in as many days			0
the quake measured 1.8 magnitude and struck at 10.09 am at a depth of 2km			1
@entity3 @entity50 : the area was the epicentre of the earthquake @entity10 is shaken by hundreds of earthquakes every year , but most are too small to detect			2
once a century there is a quake with a magnitude of 5.5 which is capable of badly damaging buildings			2
@entity10 ’s largest quake was in 1931 in @entity61 - it had a ­ magnitude 6.1 and killed one person			2
another damaging @entity10 earthquake was in the @entity66 area in 1884			0
some 1200 buildings needed repairs , chimneys collapsed and walls were cracked			0
the tremor was said to have been felt by several residents in @entity43			1
another earthquake hit the area at 3.59am on saturday - also at a depth of 2 km. despite its early morning timing , residents also felt that one too			1
they are the latest of a recent series of tremors to be measured by the @entity81 in the @entity10			0
there are roughly 200 - 300 quakes in @entity10 every year , but the vast majority are so small that no one notices them			0
however between 20 - 30 are over 2.0 magnitude which can be felt over a wider area			1
pronounced : a scale showing the @entity3 quake data uploaded from @entity91 @entity10 earthquakes , particularly in @entity93 , are most often attributed to glacial rebound			0
until about 10 , 500 years ago much of the north of the @entity10 was covered by a thick layer of ice - which pushed the rocks down into the underlying mantle			0
these rocks have been slowly rising back up ever since the ice melted , causing occasional earthquakes in the process			0
the @entity10 is also subject to tectonic stresses caused by the expansion of the @entity106 , which is slowly pushing the entire of @entity108 to the east , and from the northward motion of @entity111 , which is pushing into @entity112 from the south			0
in addition there are smaller spreading centres beneath the @entity117 , the @entity118 and the @entity119 , all of which exert tectonic stresses upon @entity10 .			0

tremor measured 2.9 magnitude and struck at 5.20am
felt in areas including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19
million times weaker than the 8.9 earthquake which struck off the @entity40 coast , causing a devastating tsunami in march 2011
