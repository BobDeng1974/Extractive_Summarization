a @entity1 rocket carrying the world ’s first all - electric communications satellites successfully launched this morning			1
the huge 22 - story tall booster took off from @entity6 in @entity7 at 3.50am gmt this morning ( 10.50pm est yesterday ) , the third flight in less than two months for @entity1			1
on this occasion , though , @entity1 made no attempt to land the rocket again on a floating barge , as they had done previously			1
it is seen here over the skyline of downtown @entity20 in a two minute time exposure of the launch on top of the rocket were a pair of satellites built by @entity27 and owned by @entity30 - based @entity29 communications and @entity32 - based @entity31 ( @entity31 )			1
the satellites are unique in that they are powered solely by ion propulsion , as opposed to chemical propellant that is usually favoured			1
this has the benefit of making the much lighter , as they do n’t need to carry fuel with them			0
‘ the value of electrical propulsion is that it allows the satellite operator to need much less fuel than when the satellite has chemical propulsion , ’ @entity29 chief executive @entity41 said in an interview before launch			2
without the fuel they would normally need - hydrazine - the satellites each weighed less than 5,000lbs ( 2,270kg ) , whereas normally they would have weighed more than 8,000lbs ( 3,630kg ) without an ion propulsion system			1
this also meant both satellites could be carried by @entity1 ’s medium - sized @entity1 rocket – had they been laden with fuel , only one could have been taken to orbit on this launch			1
this also brought the cost of the launch down - @entity29 and @entity31 paid around £ 20 million ( $ 30 million ) each to place their satellites on the rocket , as a single launch costs about £ 40 million ( $ 60 million )			2
however , as ion propulsion - also known as @entity68 - is much weaker than chemical propulsion , it will take them months rather than weeks to reach their desired geostationary orbit			1
‘ you can have a much lighter satellite , so that , in theory , the cost of your launch is much reduced			0
’ the lighter of the two satellites , @entity77 , will reach its destination by the end of august , while the @entity82 spacecraft will take a few weeks longer			1
in space , the two satellites were released one by one in opposite directions , so as to avoid a collision			0
once in their desired orbits , about 22,300 miles ( 35,800km ) above @entity87 , they will be able to remain operational for at least two decades			0
to get there , they will use what is called a ‘ supersynchronous transfer orbit ’ , which involves performing a large elliptical ‘ loop ’ around @entity87 to reach this relatively distant location			0
once they reach their orbits , they will remain in one position over a particular part of the world , providing coverage to certain areas			0
specifically , the @entity105 satellite will connect the @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity109			0
the @entity82 satellite , meanwhile , will provide coverage from @entity112 and @entity113 to @entity114			0
@entity29 's spacecraft will become part of a 35 - member network providing a range of mobile , internet , video and other communications services			2
the new satellite expands the company 's reach into the @entity106			0
@entity31 , which currently has six satellites , will position its new spacecraft to also serve customers in @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity109			0
the companies are partnering for a second pair of satellites that are due to launch aboard another @entity1 rocket later this year			1
@entity1 also flies cargo missions to the @entity136 for @entity137 and is working on an upgraded spaceship to fly astronauts as well			0
the next @entity1 launch , which will take a communications satellite for @entity142 into orbit , is currently scheduled for 21 march 2015			2
on top of the rocket ( shown ) were a pair of satellites built by @entity27 and owned by @entity30 - based @entity29 communications and @entity32 - based @entity31 ( @entity31 )			2
the satellites are unique in that they are powered solely by ion propulsion , as opposed to chemical propellant that is usually favoured the rocket flies through @entity154 skies in this view from @entity156 after its liftoff from @entity6			1
without chemical fuel the weight of the satellites was drastically reduced , allowing both to be launched on the same rocket rather than costly separate launches			1
in space , the two satellites were released one by one in opposite directions , so as to avoid a collision the @entity168 above shows the moment the first of the two satellites - @entity77 - was released into orbit the two satellites are seen here before launch			2
@entity77 is on the top , and the @entity82 is on the bottom of the payload			0
the latter was slightly heavier to support the weight of the former			0

a @entity1 rocket has lifted off from @entity6 in @entity7 carrying the world 's first all - electric satellites
the two spacecraft will reach their desired orbit in august of this year and will *maintain* *itusing* ion propulsion
without chemical fuel their weight was drastically reduced , allowing both to be launched on the same rocket rather than costly separate launches
