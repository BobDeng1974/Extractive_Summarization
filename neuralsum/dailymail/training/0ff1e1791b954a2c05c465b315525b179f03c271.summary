a belief that big is beautiful is causing a self - inflected obesity crisis in a @entity3 country and putting the lives of women at risk			1
in @entity8 , that lies between the @entity9 and @entity10 , women are encouraged to gain as much weight as possibly from childhood in order to be considered attractive			1
having a fat wife is desirable and is a sign of wealth and prestige in the country where food is in short supply			1
@entity40 journalist @entity39 was sent to @entity8 to investigate the problem for the @entity43 documentary series , @entity44			0
but he was n't just to observe what was happening - he had to eat the diet of the @entity48 women and take the pills they took to see what impact it had on his health			1
he found that girls are fattened up from the age of eight by their families in a practice referred to as ' gavage ' - a @entity61 word that means force feeding and is used to describe the fattening of geese to make foie gras			1
once they reach a marriageable age , girls are sent to ' fat camps ' in the desert where they are fed 15,000 calories a day			1
for breakfast , the girls have breadcrumbs soaked in olive oil washed down with camel 's milk			1
they then have frequent meals throughout the day of goat 's meat , bread , figs and couscous , all with more camel milk to drink			0
fattening up : women are encouraged top consume 15,000 calories a day if they want to find a husband @entity39 found that many refer to the over-eating as torture and parents have been known to crush their daughters ' toes with pincers if they resist			2
after trying the diet , @entity39 put on nearly a stone in two days and was left feeling bloated and unhealthy			0
' women ca n't have children because of this type of gavage			2
the big problem is this often leads to heart failure , repeated heart attacks , rare are the ones who escape ' he said : ' it feels like the food has filled my entire chest cavity and is now deflating my lungs			0
' he questioned how the women must feel having to do this over a lifetime given how terrible it made him feel after two days			2
their obesity also means the women are more likely to suffer from ill - health and develop problems like heart disease			1
@entity39 said he felt sick from the food he was having to consume , a problem often experienced by the @entity48 women			2
so they have found another way to gain weight that 's easier to stomach but just as damaging to their health - taking pills			2
bloated : at desert ' fat camps ' girls have to consume pints of camel 's milk a day one local woman told @entity39 : ' medication is the modern form of gavage			2
women use steroids and they are taking pills made from @entity142 pills are not meant to be used by humans			0
' the women said the animal growth hormones end up giving the women who take them a disproportionate body shape with a big stomach , face and breasts but thin arms and legs			1
she said : ' the person now looks more like a seal than a human being			0
' the pill taking can also have dangerous side effects from infertility to heart failure			0
she said : ' women ca n't have children because of this type of gavage			0
the big problem is this often leads to heart failure , repeated heart attacks , rare are the ones who escape			0
there are consequences - diseases , malformations and insanity			0
' in a separate study , @entity176 from @entity177 and @entity178 in the @entity40 found that almost a quarter of women in @entity8 reported being force fed as a child and 32 per cent of women and 29 per cent of men in the country approved of the practice			1
@entity176 writes that ' these practices are unlikely to be discontinued in the near future without considerable effort to change cultural norms			0

@entity22 is believed to be beautiful in the @entity3 country
obesity in a wife is a sign of wealth and prestige
girls are force - fed from age of eight to make them marriageable
women take dangerous animal growth hormones to increase *appetite*
