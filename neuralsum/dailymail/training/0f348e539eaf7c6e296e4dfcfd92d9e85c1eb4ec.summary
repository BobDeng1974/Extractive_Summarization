by @entity0 published : 17:13 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 17:50 est , 11 june 2013 an aspiring actor has undergone extensive cosmetic procedures to look like movie heartthrob @entity4			1
in nearly two hours of treatments , @entity6 , 32 , from @entity7 , was give $ 5,000 worth of @entity8 and filler injections to make his face look like his hero			1
he hopes the procedures will help him hit the big time in @entity16 - as well as improve his chances with women			2
' i 'm going for roles that demand a more rugged look in a man 's face			2
my favorite @entity4 movie is @entity34 , a role that suits that type of heroic face			2
' he adds that ' women love @entity4 ' , who he rates as a ' great actor			1
' ' he 's got a look that a lot of people in @entity44 are looking for right now , especially in my line of work , ' @entity6 says			1
' i 'm hoping i 'll get more auditions and roles if i look more like @entity4			2
that 's why i had the surgery			2
' before : @entity6 says he wanted more definition in his jaw bone to give a more rugged look ... after : a week later , with the swelling and some light bruising down , @entity6 is ' over the moon ' with the results the procedure saw @entity59 receive dozens of injectable fillers with a specific formulation of non-animal - sourced hyaluronic acid to plump out various parts of his face			1
' i 'm secretly excited how woman will react now i look a little bit more like their celebrity crush ' @entity71 surgeon dr @entity70 , who specializes in @entity16 transformations and facial remodeling , operated on @entity6 on may 7th			1
he explained : ' the patient already shares some similarities with @entity4 , but has some deficiencies , so we built those areas out to give him that squared - off jaw @entity4 made famous			2
' we filled out the temples and put a little @entity8 around the brow			1
then we injected some product along the cheek junction , to make it a little smoother , ' he said			2
a-list aspirations : @entity6 and his surgeon dr @entity70 plan how they will make his face more closely resemble that of @entity4 @entity92 changes : dr @entity70 says he addressed the hollowness in @entity6 's face , and built out the jaw ' the biggest issue i wanted to address was the hollowness in the face			1
we injected more product to blend it with the cheekbone			0
the patient 's laugh lines were also a little prominent , so we filled them in to smooth them out - this really gives the patient a youthful , well - rested appearance			0
' he was deficient in the jaw , along its border , so we basically built out the entire jaw , squaring it off just like @entity4 's			0
' that , dr @entity70 says , is the ' @entity16 ' face you 'll recognize from screen actors such as @entity4 or @entity118			0
' their faces are what we call the " aesthetic ideal "			0
' no laughing matter : dr @entity70 also addressed @entity6 's laugh lines , which ' were a little prominent , ' so filled them in to smooth them out - ' this really gives the patient a youthful , well - rested appearance , ' he says costly : the entire set of procedures took two hours , and set @entity6 back by $ 5,000 and it seems @entity6 is not the only one who aspires to that look			1
the surgeon says male patients often bring photographs of @entity4 into his surgery			0
' @entity4 is the must - have face in @entity44 , ' he says			0
' he is considered to be the sexiest man in @entity16 , and it 's not just his charming smile and blue eyes			0
' @entity4 's face is what i call an " architectural masterpiece " in terms of bone structure , including a squared - off appearance between the cheekbones and jaw bone			0
' a week later , with the swelling and some light bruising down , @entity6 is ' over the moon ' with the results			1
just like @entity6 : a series of photographs in dr @entity70 's office show @entity6 's transformation strong : the surgeon says @entity6 was deficient in the jaw , along its border , so he built out the entire jaw , ' squaring it off just like @entity4 's ' ' the first time i looked in the mirror i was shocked at how much of a change it was , i looked so much healthier too , ' he says			1
the @entity171 says the number of procedures in men has increased over 106 per cent since 1997 , and reports a sharp rise in facial rejuvenation			0
the organization says that men had almost a million cosmetic procedures in 2012 , including minimally - invasive treatments , which have become increasingly popular among those who aspire to the ' @entity16 look '			2
' it was really shocking			0
now , every morning , i have to check in the mirror to make sure it 's still there ! ' he says the similarities to the @entity16 actor are now unmistakable : ' i went to a pool party this week , like we do here in @entity27 , and this girl came up to me and she said , " you have a very @entity4 look to you			1
" i could n't believe it ! after all the stuff i had gone through , it was amazing			0
' @entity6 says the operation has not just made him look better , but feel better			1
' by getting the procedure done it 's definitely increased my confidence , ' he says			0
' i just look healthier , you know ? before i felt like my face was a little narrow and now i feel like the world is my oyster			0
' @entity6 adds that he is already picking up more work since his transformation			1
' over the moon ' : @entity59 ca n't contain his smile as dr @entity70 examines his new face more confident : @entity6 thinks he looks healthier and says he is already experiencing a career boost ' before now , my career was quite slow , but i 'm just getting started , ' he says			1
