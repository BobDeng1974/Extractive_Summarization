ever thought about switching your tampons for something a little more ... sustainable ? since the menstrual cup - a reusable silicone cup that collects menstrual fluid - is rarely advertised , most women find themselves reluctant to try it			1
writing for @entity9 , i gave the @entity10 ( or @entity11 , as it is known in the @entity12 ) a try - to work out what it is , how to use it , and what it actually feels like			1
warning : this is one graphic blog			2
if you are of the male persuasion , it ’s best you move on , because i ’m going to be talking about ( gasp ) menstruation			2
specifically , menstrual cups which collect menstrual fluid , unlike tampons and sanitary pads that absorb it			1
‘ i just feel better about having a @entity10 in my body than i do a tampon , ’ one menstrual cup devotee told me			1
menstrual cups are n’t new - they were patented in 1932 by a group of @entity12 midwives			1
but not many women use them or even know about them - perhaps due to the fact that menstrual cups are n’t widely promoted – or sold			1
conglomerates such as @entity48 are unlikely to throw big money into a product that only sells once every five years , when they can sell multiple products to one woman every month			0
mother - of - four @entity55 says she was initially sceptical about menstrual cups - but was surprised at how effective hers was with the global tampon market projected to top $ 2.6 billion in 2015 , according to market research firm @entity59 , why would they put their money anywhere else ? there are many menstrual cup brands on the market - the @entity10 , the @entity10 , the @entity65 and more			1
i tried the £ 18 ( $ 27.50 ) @entity10 , which like most menstrual cups comes in two sizes : one for women who have given birth before , and one for women who have n’t or are under 30 years of age			1
this struck one friend as slightly odd : ‘ i was 29 when i tried the @entity10 , which made me rather concerned as to what the hell was going to happen to my vagina on my 30th birthday ? ' was it going to expand that much ? ’ when i first opened the package and saw the @entity10 , i thought no freaking way am i putting that up my hoo - ha			1
and then i remembered i ’ve given birth multiple times			0
if i can push a 7lb baby out four times in a five year period , surely i can handle a squishy piece of latex that 's two inches in diameter when i first opened the package , i thought no freaking way am i putting that up my hoo - ha			2
whether or not you ’ve had a baby , it ’s dead easy - you fold the latex cup in half , then in half again			2
at that point it ’s only slightly bigger than a tampon and a whole lot more malleable			0
inserting the @entity10 was a lot easier than i thought			1
it should sit low in the vagina , with the tip of it sitting just outside your body			0
this took some getting used to as a tampon is inserted higher up in the vagina toward the cervix			0
getting it out however , was another matter			0
i ’ve heard some women reject the menstrual cup on the grounds that it ’s the new toy of vintage - shopping , tree - hugging , flat - white drinking , vegan hipster , ' says @entity129			1
this is n’t a political statement ' the @entity10 has a tendency to migrate upwards - especially if you inserted it too far up to begin with			1
if this happens , you have to do a fair bit of rooting around to pull the darn thing out			0
using what is essentially a suction cup is a much more hands - on experience than using a tampon or pad			2
a handful of women i spoke to said they found menstrual cups uncomfortable with the edges of the cup digging into their vaginal wall			2
‘ i spent the day walking like a duck			0
my friends knew when i was on as i would sit in a slightly odd manner , ’ said one			0
this , however , was n’t my experience			0
you can leave a menstrual cup in for up to eight hours - that ’s handy for overnight use			1
when it ’s time to change , you just tip the fluid into a sink and wash it out before re-inserting			2
many women i spoke to said this was one of the most fascinating aspects of a menstrual cup — you can actually see how much you bleed ( the @entity10 is marked with measurements ! ) while some women might be put off from witnessing their period up close and personal like this , i found it connected me closer to my body			1
i felt as if i was more fully experiencing an aspect of my womanhood that i had in the past treated as a nuisance			0
for some women , it ’s a matter of safeguarding their sense of what makes them a woman			0
' what draws most women to re-usable menstrual cups is that they are economical , eco-friendly and more comfortable as they do n’t cause dryness or irritation - a common bugbear of tampon users , ' says @entity129 as one friend said , ‘ after having a baby , something makes me want to protect my vagina more vigilantly , so i do n’t want to put anything up there that could be potentially hazardous to my feminine health			1
’ as a life - long user of tampons i was distrustful of the @entity10			1
but there was never a problem			0
so , does it actually work ? i was a bit fearful of leaks at first ; as a life - long user of tampons i was distrustful of the @entity10			1
but there was never a problem			0
i went swimming with it , i did dynamic yoga with it ( think splits and handstands ) , and i went to the movies with it			0
i am a convert , even as the @entity10 took a fair bit of getting used to			2
i ’ll probably supplement the @entity10 with tampons when i ’m traveling , or on a night out when i know there will be no private sink to sort out your business			2
some women i spoke to said they bring a bottle of water into a public toilet in order to clean out their menstrual cup but this strikes me as more trouble than it ’s worth			2
i ’ve heard some women reject the menstrual cup on the grounds that it ’s the new toy of vintage - shopping , tree - hugging , flat - white drinking , vegan hipsters			1
this is n’t a political statement			0
it ’s just a feminine hygiene product			0
one that works , too			0
@entity55 is a yoga teacher and journalist who lives in @entity242 with her four sons			0

the @entity10 , or @entity11 , is a reusable cup that collects menstrual fluid
the silicone *funnel* device is often thought of as the *preserve* of hippies
but *advocates* claim they are economical , eco-friendly and comfortable
*intrigued* , one sceptical mother - of - four put the device to the test
