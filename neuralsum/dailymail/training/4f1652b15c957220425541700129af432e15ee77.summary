by @entity0 an advertisement for the anti-ageing pill @entity3 , which is promoted by supermodel @entity4 , has been banned			2
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) has ruled the manufacture behind the wonder pills , @entity8 , failed to provide convincing research or evidence that they work			1
the @entity13 drugs company has invested millions in the pills and supplied a raft of research it claimed backed up marketing for the pills that they helped cure fine lines and wrinkles from within			1
model @entity4 , 45 , was hired in january this year at great expense as a model and ambassador for the @entity27 brand around the world however , the @entity5 said none of these were sufficiently robust and reliable to show the effects claimed			1
the ruling is serious blow for @entity8 , which earlier this year was at the centre of a controversial and eventually unsuccessful bid to buy the @entity37 drugs company @entity36			1
it is also embarrassing for @entity39 , 45 , who was hired in january this year at great expense as a model and ambassador for the brand around the world			1
when she took up the post , she spoke in glowing terms about the wonder pills , saying : ‘ it ’s very important for me to maintain great looking skin – not only as a model , but as a woman with lots of demands and many roles to fill each day			1
‘ caring for my skin on the inside is just as important as how i care for the outside and i can count on @entity3 to deliver deep down nourishment where it matters most			2
’ a regional press ad for the skincare tablet stated : ‘ @entity27 - beautiful skin begins within			2
award - winning skincare in a tablet			0
’ it boasted that the pill was the winner of several consumer and beauty awards and that the brand had been ‘ pioneering skincare from within since 1991 ’			2
it said the product was a : ‘ natural - based , scientifically tested skincare formulations for different ages that work from within to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles			0
’ when @entity39 took the job , she said : ' it 's very important for me to maintain great looking skin ¿ not only as a model , but as a woman ' the @entity5 asked @entity8 to provide evidence that the pills had the anti-ageing properties claimed to establish whether they were accurate and complied with @entity89 health claims rules			1
the company provided six studies which were then assessed by an independent expert to understand whether the pills really do ‘ work from within to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles ’			1
the @entity5 said the expert considered that three of the studies were not adequate substantiation , because they did not use the standard scientific procedures involving control groups where the skin of women who did not use the pills was compared against those that did			1
one of the studies consisted of only six participants , two with medical conditions that might have affected the skin or general health			2
in addition , pre and post treatment grading pictures were not assessed for two of the six participants			0
the @entity5 said the rest of the research supplied by the company was confusing and difficult to interpret			1
the watchdog said : ‘ the studies involved three , four and six - month trials with the results measured by clinical grading , self - evaluation and visual imaging techniques , but did not use methods to assess direct measures of wrinkles before or after treatment			2
’ in many cases the women involved in the trials did not see any beneficial effects			0
even tests to measure the skin thickness of the women involved did not show a clear benefit of taking the tablets			0
the @entity5 said : ‘ we considered that the reports provided were not sufficiently robust to support the claim ‘ worked from within to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles ” and concluded that the claim was misleading			1
’ the complaint was brought by the @entity143 , who is chairman of the @entity145 , which is campaigning for the honest use of figures and research			0
he welcomed the @entity5 ruling saying : ‘ this comprehensively demolishes the studies the company cited in support of its claim			1
‘ this advert sought to exploit human vanity and human credulousness			0
this case underlines how right @entity143 was to ask searching questions about @entity8 when it attempted to take over @entity36			1
’ @entity162 's advertisement has been banned by the @entity5 for being misleading a tv advert for a superfood promoted by former @entity165 rugby international @entity162 has been banned because it wrongly boasted of its nutritional values			1
in the ad for @entity168 and flax seeds @entity162 told viewers ‘ have you discovered the power of a @entity168 superfood that you can add to your diet every day ? it 's highly nutritious			0
’ the ad went on to claim by adding it to your breakfast consumers would get ‘ as much protein as a small egg : more calcium than 100ml of milk ; as much fibre as a cup of oats , and a high source of the @entity187 fatty acid			0
’ @entity162 concluded , ‘ the pure goodness of a @entity168 superfood is a great addition to a healthy diet			0
it ’s so simple , and easy to enjoy			0
@entity168 superfood : good nutrition for you			0
’ however the advertising watchdog upheld complaints that it broke @entity89 rules on what a ‘ superfood ’ actually is			0
it said : ‘ we considered the emphasis of the ad was on the comparative nutrition claims and not the specific health claims and that the ad was therefore presented in such a way that suggested it was comparative nutrition claims that supported the " superfood " general health claim , when this was not the case			2
' they ordered that the advertisement should not appear again in its current form .			0
