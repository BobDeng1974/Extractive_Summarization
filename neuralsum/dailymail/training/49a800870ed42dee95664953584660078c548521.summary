experts have discovered that @entity1 is a whole metre taller than originally thought			1
three ramblers , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 , have remeasured the @entity7 's second tallest mountain using state - of - the art gps technology and found it actually stands at 1,086m and not 1,085m as recognised by the @entity10 ( @entity10 )			1
however , the os will not be altering their maps as the natural summit of the @entity16 peak is still 1,085m , although a man - made plinth that was erected in 2009 to mark the top added an extra metre			1
mr @entity34 , 53 , said : ' our survey of @entity1 accumulated six hours of data which was later post-processed using @entity10 state of the art software , which gave a result of 1085.67m , which is rounded up to 1,086m			2
@entity3 ( right ) switches on the @entity41 to gather the first of two sets of three hours of data needed to measure the exact height of @entity1 ' this result means that the highest part of the natural summit tor which is now buried under the summit plinth is approximately 1084.8m high or 1.085m			2
' so although the natural bedrock and the @entity10 map height of 1085m will remain the same , it means that all those thousands of hill walkers who struggle up what they think is a mountain of 1085m in height are in affect climbing one extra metre and arriving at the top of @entity1 peering out on a land that is 1086m below them			1
' the early morning vigil to discover the exact height of @entity1 : ( left to right ) @entity64 , @entity4 , @entity65 , @entity3 and @entity66 an aerial view of the man - made plinth that was erected in 2009 to mark the top added an extra metre @entity73 sir @entity72 holds the @entity75 torch on the summit of @entity1 on may 29 , 2012 mr @entity3 and mr @entity4 are retired research chemists from @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity80 respectively , and mr @entity34 is a former manager at a printing firm and lives near @entity82			1
they have measured more than 150 hills in @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity16 since 2008 and have elevated two hills to mountain status , which in @entity84 and @entity16 is classed as 2,000ft			1
in 2008 they measured @entity89 in @entity90 at 2,000ft and six inches - up from 1,998ft			2
in 2013 they upgraded @entity92 in the @entity93 from 1,998ft to 2,000ft			0
there is no precise international definition of what constitutes a mountain			0
the @entity10 accepts local tradition and names			0
however , it is generally agreed that the minimum height is 2,000ft ( 610m )			0
when sir @entity102 measured @entity103 , he found it was exactly 29,000ft high but he thought that no one would believe him so he recorded it as 29,002ft			0
various subsequent measurings now have the mountain listed as 29,035ft high .			0

@entity1 is one metre taller than recognised by the @entity10 ( @entity10 )
the extra metre is caused by a man - made plinth *installed* in 2009
@entity10 will not be changing records because natural summit is still same
ramblers have measured more than 150 hills in @entity7 since 2008
they have elevated two hills up to mountain status
