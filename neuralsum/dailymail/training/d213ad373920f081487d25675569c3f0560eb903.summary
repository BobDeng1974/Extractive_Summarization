' @entity7 first decided to try veganism herself at the end of 2013 , when she and her husband @entity66 dramatically slimmed down after following the healthy eating plan			1
@entity66 posted about the plan on his @entity66 website saying : ' on december 3 , one day before my 44th birthday , i will embark on a 22 days challenge to go completely vegan , or as i prefer to call it , plant - based ! when @entity7 went vegan at the end of 2013 , she took great delight in sharing photos of the delicious food that she had been eating he continued : ' this all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a ' plant - based breakfast ' every day			1
' it was surprisingly easier on me than i thought ... @entity83 : @entity84 is also joining me			0
' @entity7 then posted a series of @entity87 pictures detailing some of their meals , which included vegan macaroni cheese			1
they were also spotted eating out at @entity91 called crossroads in @entity93			0
@entity7 @entity94 is also a fan of the plan and has previously said : ' you do feel better			2
i do recommend the vegan diet because you wake up and feel great ! '			2

now fans of the singer can emulate the diet that she undertook by signing up the the @entity16 plan @entity106 spoke to @entity108 nutritionist @entity107 , who said that a vegan diet can be good for your health			2
she said : ' a vegan diet has several health benefits , including lowering blood pressure and cholesterol , which reduces the risk of heart disease , cancer and type 2 diabetes			2
' plant - based foods are a good source of protein , whilst whole grains , vegetables and legumes are low in fat ( especially saturated fat ) , high in dietary fibre and contain no cholesterol			0
' aside from the abundance of health benefits , a vegan diet is also addressing environmental and ethical concerns which makes the vegan lifestyle even more appealing			2
' @entity7 and @entity66 both went on the diet with @entity66 saying that he found it easier than he had expected to @entity107 cautions that anyone deciding to try out veganism needs to make sure they keep their diet balanced though			1
she said : ' eliminating animal products makes it more difficult to keep a well - balanced diet , and vegans often lack essential nutrients , such as vitamins @entity84 and @entity146 , calcium and omega - 3 fatty acids			0
' although many plant - based foods contain protein , such as beans and tofu , it is often not enough ; deficiency and iron anaemia is another issue when replacing meat with other products			0
' a vegan diet lacks vitamin b - 12 , which is essential for the function of every cell in our bodies			0
@entity84 can only be found in certain types of algae			0
' embarking on a vegan meal plan is a big change for the body , and as with any diet , education and planning are vital in order to ensure you get a balanced diet of vitamins and nutrition			1
' i would also suggest consulting a nutritionist or a doctor to make sure you are suited for this diet and that it is nutritionally wholesome			0
' and keep in mind that becoming vegan does n't automatically make you healthier , and perhaps it is not necessary to make a full - fledged lifestyle change			0
