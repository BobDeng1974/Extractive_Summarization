@entity14 , on the @entity12 estate in @entity13 , has had its roof covered in traditional clay pantiles which have rendered it a bright shade of orange			1

despite the completion of the new roof , the 200 - year - old hall will not be ready for its new inhabitants for some time yet			2
much of the building , which was previously leased from the @entity46 as a private home , is still covered in scaffolding , while a skip has been left in the driveway			0
