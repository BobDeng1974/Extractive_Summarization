@entity9 , 67 , was stunned to learn that her home of 55 years in @entity11 had been snapped up by @entity12 after the church that owned the land had failed to pay taxes on it			1
@entity12 wanted to charge her $ 300 a month for the rent - which she could not afford			1
but this week , the @entity19 unanimously voted to try to buy the land from @entity21 so that @entity9 , who lost her eyesight to a degenerative disease 30 years ago , does not have to move			2
now the town is trying to buy it back from the buyer now they are hoping that he accepts their offer to pay a fair market price , which would be determined by an independent appraiser			1

but in the 1970s , @entity9 was told the land had been sold to the town			1
in fact , the church still owned the little section of land and stopped paying taxes on it			0
home : land beneath the house , pictured , was owned by a church , which failed to pay taxes on it due to these outstanding payments , the property went to a tax sale in 2009 , where it was snapped up for the minimal amount by @entity12			1
deal : the town is hopeful that the new buyer , @entity12 ( pictured ) , will take the deal ' for some reason nobody told this lady and or anybody else the land was on a tax sale , consequently the man who bought it only paid $ 43 for land , ' @entity80 , the town treasurer , said			1
if the town successfully buys it from @entity12 , they will offer @entity9 a ' life estate ' , which would allow her to live there for the rest of her life			2
