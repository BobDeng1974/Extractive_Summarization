infectious diseases , such as @entity1 and @entity3 virus , will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming			2
this is according to zoologist , professor @entity8 , who warns humans can expect to face new illnesses as climate change brings crops , livestock , and humans into contact with pathogens			1
professor @entity8 says it will be ' the death of a thousand cuts ' with society unable to keep up with the speed of disease as it spreads around the world			1
' there are going to be a lot of localised outbreaks that put a lot of pressure on our medical and veterinary health systems			0
' in his research , professor @entity8 has focused primarily on parasites in the tropics , while his colleague , professor @entity49 , has worked in @entity51 regions			1
each has observed the arrival of species that had n't previously lived in that area and the departure of others , said professor @entity8 , who is affiliated with the @entity58			1
changes in habitat from global warming could mean animals are exposed to new parasites and pathogens			1
in 1990 , the @entity66 's climate panel predicted with ‘ substantial confidence ’ that the world would warm at twice the rate that has been observed since			2
pictured are two projected outcomes of global warming from 2081 - 2100 ' over the last 30 years , the places we 've been working have been heavily impacted by climate change , ' he added			2
' though i was in the tropics and he was in the @entity51 , we could see something was happening			0
' changes in habitat from global warming could mean animals are exposed to new parasites and pathogens			1
for example , some lungworms in recent years have moved northward and shifted hosts from caribou to muskoxen in the @entity51			0
but for more than 100 years , scientists have assumed parasites do n't quickly jump from one species to another because of the way parasites and hosts co-evolve			1
professor @entity8 calls it the ' parasite paradox			1
' over time , hosts and pathogens become more tightly adapted to one another			0
according to previous theories , this should make emerging diseases rare , because they have to wait for the right random mutation to occur			0
but it turns out such jumps happen more quickly than anticipated			0
even pathogens that are highly adapted to one host are able to shift to new ones under the right circumstances			0
@entity111 is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes			0
it thrives in warm and humid conditions - which could one day include include large areas in @entity117 @entity117 holiday destinations could become hotspots for the nasty viral illness thanks to climate change , experts have warned			1
the @entity123 in @entity124 , the @entity125 @entity126 and southern @entity125 are the areas at most risk , according to research last year by the @entity130 ( @entity130 )			2
@entity111 is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes			0
symptoms include a severe flu - like illness , fever , headache , muscle ache , rash , nausea and vomiting			2
the new study was based on data collected in @entity143 , where dengue is a common problem			2
researchers looked at the occurrence of the viral illness and climate variables such as temperature , humidity and rainfall , along with other factors			0
they then combined their findings with information about @entity157 countries , to model which areas are most likely to be at risk , according to the study , published in the journal @entity162			0
' our study has shown that the risk of dengue fever is likely to increase in @entity117 under climate change , ' said lead researcher professor @entity168			2
' almost all of the excess risk will fall on the coastal areas of the @entity126 and @entity173 seas and the @entity175 part of @entity124 , particularly the @entity123			0
' professor @entity8 is calling for a ' fundamental conceptual shift ' recognising that parasites and pathogens retain genetic capabilities that allow them to quickly shift to new hosts			1
' though a parasite might have a very specialised relationship with one particular host in one particular place , there are other hosts that may be as susceptible , ' professor @entity8 said			1
in fact , the new hosts are more susceptible to infection and get sicker from it , he said , because they have n't yet developed resistance			0
though resistance can evolve fairly rapidly , this only changes the emergent pathogen from an acute disease problem to a chronic problem , @entity8 said			1
' @entity3 is a good example of this phenomenon - no longer an acute disease problem for humans or wildlife in @entity202 , it nonetheless is here to stay , ' he said			2
in addition to treating human cases of an emerging disease and developing a vaccine for it , he said , scientists can learn which non-human species carry the virus			1
' we have to admit we 're not winning the war against emerging diseases , ' professor @entity8 said			1
' we 're not anticipating them			0
we 're not paying attention to their basic biology , where they might come from and the potential for new pathogens to be introduced			0

this is according to @entity225 - based zoologist professor @entity8
warm habitats mean animals are exposed to new parasites and disease
scientists had assumed parasites do n't move rapidly between species
but new research reveals these parasites evolve faster than expected
society will not keep up with pace of change , warns professor @entity8
