former @entity1 striker @entity0 made sure @entity3 ’ reign at @entity4 started in style scoring a hat - trick in @entity8 ’s 3 - 0 win over @entity9			1
despite the best efforts of fussy referee @entity11 , @entity3 picked up his first win and it was largely thanks to the @entity14 international who scored twice in the first half and then again after the break to help @entity8 move away from the @entity18 drop zone			1
@entity0 had the ball in the net inside three minutes when @entity21 tricked his way down the right and rolled the ball into @entity26 ’ path			2
the right back crossed to @entity8 ’s leading scoring and he scored with a powerful header			0
@entity3 applauds the @entity8 fans before his first home game in charge against @entity9 on friday night @entity3 gazes towards the skies prior to the hosts game against @entity8 on friday night the former @entity36 boss looks on from the touchline as his side train prior to their home clash @entity0 punches the air after scoring his side 's opening goal in their @entity18 clash against @entity9 the 25 - year - old slots home coolly from close range after a superb solo run to make it 2 - 0 to @entity8 the former @entity1 man is all smiles as he doubles his side 's advantage just after the half hour mark at the @entity54 @entity0 looks to the skies in elation after notching his side second 's goal as the forward takes on @entity60 @entity8 : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity0 ( @entity68 , 87 ) , @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 , 71 ) , @entity72 ( @entity73 , 8 ) @entity9 : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 ( @entity80 , 45 ) , @entity81 , @entity82 ( @entity83 , 76 ) , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 ( @entity87 , 60 ) goals scored : @entity0 3 , 32 , 53 one of the things that @entity3 will need to get used to in @entity18 is the tendency for some referees to penalise the slightest physical contact			1
in recent years match officials ’ style has change and become closer to that of @entity98 referees but @entity11 is old - school and frustrated @entity3 by whistling every @entity8 challenge in the early part of the game			1
@entity3 has demanded his players be more physical but both @entity21 and @entity104 went into the book for what looked like harmless challenges			0
@entity8 ’s football was bright though with @entity21 linking well with the excellent @entity0 and shooting over as the home side went for the second goal			1
striker @entity72 pulled up with a hamstring injury and had to be replaced by @entity73 but it did nothing to knock @entity8 out of their stride and @entity0 soon had the second			2
he ran onto a perfectly weighted pass from skipper @entity69 and sprinted between @entity9 ’s two central defenders to score past @entity74			0
former @entity118 midfielder @entity67 ( left ) challenges @entity119 de @entity85 during the first half @entity9 's @entity79 ( r ) fights for the ball with @entity8 midfielder @entity21 ( @entity122 ) , as @entity3 looks on with interest during the match @entity9 threatened through their @entity126 striker @entity125 but he squandered two chances in the first 45 minutes and @entity8 goalkeeper @entity61 saved well from @entity128			1
@entity0 was on form though and he played @entity21 in with a brilliant pass only for the former @entity133 forward ’s cross to be blocked			0
@entity0 almost scored at the start of the second half but @entity74 turned his shot away for a corner			0
@entity0 has a superb record against @entity9 who came into the game never having won at @entity4 and having lost this fixture 4 - 0 last season			1
the @entity14 has the quality to lead @entity8 up the table and his third goal was the pick of the three burying a shot in the far corner through through the legs of @entity9 defender @entity150			2
@entity0 is a reminder of why @entity8 were playing @entity153 football last season and when he was hauled down by @entity154 pulled out perhaps his first justifiable card of the night			2
he is not the only jewel in the squad @entity3 has inherited			0
@entity71 came on for @entity21 in the last 20 minutes and orchestrated some of the best football of the night			0
the @entity160 under - 21 international has lost his way of late but @entity3 will be encouraged by this cameo			0
he will also be delighted with a second clean sheet from his players			0
if that and the form of @entity0 , who went off to a standing ovation four minutes from time , keeps up then @entity8 will soon be back at the right end of the table			2
@entity66 looks to put a challenge in on @entity9 's @entity171 during the second half @entity3 looks deep in thought as he issues instructions to his sociedad side against @entity9 @entity3 shows the vocal side to his management as he seeks more from his side during the opening 45 minutes			1

@entity3 secured a win in his first home game in charge of @entity8
the former @entity36 manager led his side to a *comfortable* 3 - 0 win against @entity9
former @entity1 forward @entity0 scored a superb hat - trick in just 53 minutes to give the hosts *victory*
it was only the second win in 11 league matches for the struggling @entity18 outfit
