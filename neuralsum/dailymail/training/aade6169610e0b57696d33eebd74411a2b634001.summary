by @entity0 unleashing the full might of the justice system on a @entity4 for the theft of two 10p plastic bags might , even in itself , have seemed a little heavy handed			1
but when the justice system then got into a muddle over the difference between a @entity4 and a @entity12 , the case descended into farce			1
the prosecution of @entity15 , 26 , for stealing two supermarket ‘ bags for life ’ has ended up costing taxpayers £ 5,000 – after a blunder in which the wrong translator was sent to court			1
@entity15 , 26 , was arrested after he swiped two ' bags for life ' , costing 10p each , from a @entity27 's store in @entity28 , @entity29 the @entity4 national was arrested for the theft from @entity27 ’s on wednesday last week and detained by police			1
but when he went to court the following day , a @entity12 - speaking interpreter was accidentally sent instead of a @entity4 speaker and the hearing had to be postponed			1
@entity15 then spent a second night in custody before returning to @entity37 ’ @entity38 for another hearing , after a translator who spoke the correct language had been found			1
a court source commented afterwards : ‘ it ’s like someone somewhere had just picked out a country that begins with “ l ”			0
’ by this time the estimated bill for keeping @entity49 in custody and dealing with his case had risen to around £ 3,000			0
he admitted stealing the bags from the supermarket in @entity28 , @entity29			2
but because he was in breach of a suspended sentence for a previous crime he was jailed for six weeks – of which he will serve half – adding a further £ 2,000 to the public ’s bill for holding him in prison			1
he was not ordered to pay any contribution to court costs or for the stolen 10p bags			2
the trial of @entity15 , 26 , ended up costing £ 3,000 after the wrong translator was hired for his appearance at @entity38 ( above ) the @entity72 said the jail sentence validated its decision to bring the case to court			1
@entity15 ’s previous offence , for which he was given the suspended jail term , was not revealed but is believed to be theft			2
after the case , @entity81 of the @entity82 ’ @entity80 said : ‘ criminals must always be brought to justice , but this seems a remarkable amount of taxpayers ’ money to spend on a rather minor case			0
‘ ordinary people rightly expect justice , but they do n’t expect it to cost over the odds			0
avoidable errors have only put the cost up more			0
’ after @entity15 – a @entity4 national said to have been living in @entity99 – was arrested for stealing the bags , officers summoned a @entity4 translator to make the 60 - mile trip from @entity103 to @entity28 to enable him to be questioned			1
the interpreter spent around four hours with him before returning home			0
but the same person was not available to translate for him in court the following morning , and @entity108 , the translation services firm contracted to provide interpreters for court cases , sent a @entity12 - speaking woman instead			2
due to a shortage of @entity12 speakers , this interpreter made a 160 - mile , three - hour trip from @entity117 in @entity118 , only to discover she could n’t do the job			1
magistrates realised what had happened and apologised , before advising the translator to ensure she still got paid			0
@entity15 spent another night in police custody , and when he was brought back to court on friday a @entity4 interpreter had finally been found			1
yesterday a @entity108 spokesman blamed police for the blunder : ‘ @entity130 and @entity131 supplied a @entity12 interpreter on may 29 because the police booked a @entity12 interpreter			0
‘ when the magistrates ’ court realised the error they informed us that a @entity4 interpreter was required instead			2
‘ we therefore supplied a @entity4 interpreter on may 30			0
’ a @entity143 spokesman said : ‘ we will be working with @entity108 to look into the full circumstances as to why the wrong interpreter attended court			0
’ official figures released last month show the cost to the taxpayer of hiring court interpreters under the outsourcing deal has almost doubled to £ 15.5million in just one year			0
there are around 11,000 foreign nationals in @entity155 prisons – about 13 per cent of the total population – and many require interpreters at court hearings and appeals .			0
