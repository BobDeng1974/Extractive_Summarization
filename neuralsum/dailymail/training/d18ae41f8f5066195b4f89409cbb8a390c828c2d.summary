a @entity1 woman has created an @entity3 account which allows women to share all of the weird , wacky - and sometimes downright horrifying - messages that they receive from men via dating websites and apps like @entity9			1
@entity12 created the @entity14 account as a means of allowing women to air some of their more outrageous online dating interactions , after realizing how many obscene and offensive messages she and her friends were receiving on a daily basis			1
' i realized these hostile messages were a trend that women see online , ' the operations coordinator told @entity24			1
bye @entity14 : the account encourages women to bond over their shared online dating disasters rude and ridiculous : some of the messages featured include insults about appearance , while others are aggressive and sometimes even violent ' it shows our cultural misogyny problem ' : @entity12 believes there is a pattern to the behavior of many of the men featured , with the majority lashing out as a result of being rejected ' that started a conversation about creating an @entity3 to keep all of these insane messages so we could discuss them			1
all women get some degree of creepy or weird messages when they sign up for online dating sites			2
' @entity12 hopes that the account will help women who have suffered any kind of hostile or abusive dating messages to realize that they are not alone			1
and having sifted through a seemingly - endless stream of submissions , she points out that there is a clear and obvious pattern in the behavior of almost all of the aggressive messengers			0
' it 's a standard reaction that i 've now seen over and over again with the submissions , ' she added			0
' @entity66 hits on girl , girl does n't respond , guy lashes out with insulting message			0
it really shows the entitlement these guys feel , and i think it shows our cultural misogyny problem			0
' while some of the submissions featured are too rude to repeat , others are slightly more ridiculous and include a variety of extraordinary comebacks from jaded gentlemen , irate at the thought of being turned down			0
mastermind : the account is the brainchild of @entity1 - based operations coordinator @entity12 ' i am not interested ' : a lot of the women who send in submissions to the account are very clear about their feelings early on in the conversation , however their honesty is rarely met with a reasonable response downright rude : many of the women find themselves facing a barrage of indecent questions one woman , after seemingly ignoring a man 's advances , was told : ' yeahhhh so i have come to the conclusion that you are a class a b * * * h. with toe nail fungus and you probably like to eat @entity106 while you watch reruns of @entity108			1
' another , who dared to respond to one of the numerous insults being hurled in her direction , received a message telling her to ' cut her face off with a bottle '			2
thus far the account has almost 26,000 followers , a number which is continuing to grow by the hour as word spreads to other disgruntled women			2
@entity123 is hopeful that it will have an impact on at least a few of the men who are featured - and perhaps even encourage them to change their attitude towards women and the online dating community			2
she said : ' maybe a guy will see it and put a second thought into sending a woman a mean message			0
' creeped out : many men become instantly aggressive when a woman fails to show interest over-the - top aggression : in some cases , the woman does n't			0
