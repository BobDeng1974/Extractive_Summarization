e-cigarettes designed to help people quit smoking could act as a ' gateway ' to addiction to illegal drugs , scientists in the @entity1 have today warned e-cigarettes designed to help people quit smoking could act as a ' gateway ' to addiction to illegal drugs , scientists have today warned			1
like conventional cigarettes , the devices are said to raise the risk of addiction to banned substances including cannabis and cocaine			1
scientists pointed out that while eliminating many of the toxic compounds found in tobacco , e-cigarettes delivered highly addictive ' pure nicotine '			1
in mice , nicotine was found to alter brain biochemistry and prime the animals to develop a need for cocaine			1
analysis of human data suggested it had the same effect in people , with cocaine addiction rates highest among former cigarette smokers			2
professor @entity35 , who conducted the research with his wife , dr @entity37 , said : ' our findings provided a biological basis for the sequence of drug use observed in people			1
' one drug alters the brain 's circuitry in a way that enhances the effects of a subsequent drug			2
' writing in the @entity50 , the married couple from @entity52 , @entity53 , warned : ' e-cigarettes have the same physiological effects on the brain and may pose the same risk of addiction to other drugs as regular cigarettes , especially in adolescence during a critical period of brain development			1
' we do n't yet know whether e-cigarettes will prove to be a gateway to the use of conventional cigarettes and illicit drugs , but that 's certainly a possibility			0
' @entity71 clearly acts as a gateway drug on the brain , and this effect is likely to occur whether the exposure comes from smoking cigarettes , passive tobacco smoke , or e-cigarettes			2
' the typical e-cigarette user is a long - term smoker who has been unable to quit , they said			0
but popularity of the devices was increasing at an accelerating rate among adolescents and young adults			2
' the effects we saw in adult mice are probably even stronger in adolescent animals , ' said @entity35 , who in 2000 shared the @entity91 for his research on the physiological basis of memory			1
' e-cigarettes may be a gateway to both combustible cigarettes and illicit drugs			0
' therefore , we should do all we can to protect young people from the harmful effects of nicotine and the risks of progressing to illicit drugs			2
' his wife added : ' the recent legalisation of marijuana in @entity108 and @entity109 has rekindled the debate about whether marijuana is a gateway drug			0
' yet both proponents and opponents of legalisation have overlooked the role of nicotine in leading to the use of illicit drugs and to addiction			0
' the married scientists @entity35 and @entity37 pointed out that while eliminating many of the toxic compounds found in tobacco , e-cigarettes delivered highly addictive ' pure nicotine '			1
in mice , nicotine was found to alter brain biochemistry and prime the animals to develop a need for cocaine			1
file picture professor @entity134 , chair of psychiatry at @entity136 , said : ' the emergence in our society of new recreational pharmaceuticals such as e-cigarettes and legalised marijuana , while justifiable on one level , may have adverse consequences of which we are not fully aware			0
' the @entity146 ' research on ' gateway ' drugs demonstrates such grave potential consequences			0
' more than a million people in the @entity151 are believed to get their nicotine ' fix ' from e-cigarettes , but opinion is divided about the safety of the devices			1
e-cigarettes have a surprisingly long history dating back to 1963 when @entity159 , a 40 - a - day smoker from @entity161 , @entity162 , filed a patent for a ' smokeless non-tobacco cigarette '			0
his invention worked by gently heating a nicotine solution to produce a vapour that could be inhaled , thereby ' replacing burning tobacco and paper with heated , moist , flavoured air '			0
but at a time when 70 per cent of adult males in the @entity151 alone were regular smokers , he failed to secure financial backing for the idea .			0

married scientists from @entity52 have warned e-cigarettes have same *psychological* effects on the brain as *traditional* ones
@entity35 and @entity37 said they may pose the same risk of addiction to cocaine and cannabis especially among adolescents
devices deliver highly addictive ' pure nicotine ' found to *encourage* addiction in tests on mice
