scientists are closer to finding a galactic ' skeleton ' that they believe could be lurking inside the fabric of our galaxy			1
discovering these ' bones ' could help researchers get a better picture of the @entity8 looks like from the outside			2
a @entity11 team has already discovered one of the galactic bone while studying a dust cloud nicknamed ' @entity15 '			1
scientists are closer to finding a galactic ' skeleton ' that they believe could be lurking inside the fabric of our galaxy			2
in this image , the dashed line represents the location of the physical galactic mid-plane			0
the colour circles inside the green box are sources belonging to one of the identified ' bones ' @entity15 was identified in 2013 by the light it absorbed			1
radio emissions from molecular gas show that @entity15 not a chance projection of material on the sky , but instead a real feature			2
not only is ' @entity15 ' in the galactic plane , but also it extends much longer than anyone anticipated			2
this slender bone of the @entity8 is more than 300 light - years long but only one or two light - years wide			1
it contains about 100,000 suns ' worth of material , and looks more like a cosmic snake			0
a study presented at the 225th meeting of the @entity46 shows that @entity15 is not alone			0
@entity15 was identified by the light it absorbed			1
radio emissions from molecular gas show that @entity15 not a chance projection of material on the sky , but instead a real feature our @entity8 is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel - shaped collection of stars , gas and dust			1
it has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity66 , an undergraduate physics student at the @entity67 , claims to have found six candidates for galactic bones in a new study			1
' it 's a really new field of study , ' ms @entity66 told @entity73 at the @entity46 meeting in @entity75			0
our @entity8 is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel - shaped collection of stars , gas and dust			1
it has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk			1
astronomers have identified a new structure in the @entity8 : a long tendril of dust and gas that they are calling a ' bone			1
' observations , especially at infrared wavelengths of light , have found long skinny features jutting between galaxies ' spiral arms			1
these relatively straight structures are much less massive than the curving spiral arms			2
discovering these ' bones ' could help researchers get a better picture of the @entity8 looks like from the outside			0
' what i was trying to do was basically prove that the @entity15 filament was n't some curiosity , was n't a fluke - that there are other filaments out there similar to @entity15 that can trace galactic structure			0
' other spiral galaxies also display internal bones or endoskeletons			0
observations , especially at infrared wavelengths of light , have found long skinny features jutting between galaxies ' spiral arms			1
ms @entity66 explained that there are some initial criteria for a galactic bone			0
for instance , they must lie mostly parallel to the plane of the galaxy			0
they should also to trace the spine of the @entity125 , one of the largest arms in the @entity8			0
and a bone must also be more than 50 times longer than it is wide			0
ms @entity66 's team are currently analysing something dubbed ' @entity132 , ' which lies in the @entity125 , but on the opposite side of the galaxy @entity15			2
astronomers know that the @entity8 is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel - shaped collection of stars , gas and dust			1
it has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk			2
since we view the @entity8 from the inside , its exact structure is difficult to determine			0
scientists say finding these bones could serve as a guide for creating a sketch of the @entity8 ' major structural elements			0
astronomers know that the @entity8 is a spiral galaxy - a pinwheel - shaped collection of stars , gas and @entity156 has a central bar and two major spiral arms that wrap around its disk			1
since we view the @entity8 from the inside ( pictured ) , its exact structure is difficult to determine .			0

' bones ' are tendrils of dust and gas that jut between galaxy 's spiral arms
so far one bone , nicknamed @entity15 , has been identified from its light
now the @entity67 claims to have found six strong candidates for galactic bones , which may make up the skeleton of the @entity8
