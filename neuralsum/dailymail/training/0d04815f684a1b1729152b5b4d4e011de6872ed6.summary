' @entity0 ! ' exclaims @entity1 , as he flicks the reins on our horse and carriage , and we are off , bouncing along a dirt track through olive trees			1
we 're in the heart of the @entity10 countryside in @entity11 , the heel of @entity13			1
our children @entity15 , five , and @entity16 , three , are holding on tight			0
@entity1 chuckles : ' in @entity13 we always like to look after the ladies ! ' we pass workers raking the arid earth so the olives can fall on the ground			1
@entity22 , madly deeply : the conical stone house @entity22 of @entity24 is touristy but cute a three - wheel truck is laden with crates of them , and on the wind comes the scent of a bonfire burning the fallen leaves and branches			0
@entity11 is defined by the olive			1
not only does it have the oldest tree in @entity13 - more than 2,000 years old - it produces 40 per cent of the country 's olives and is renowned for manufacturing the finest olive oil			1
back at the stables , @entity1 introduces us to his shaggy @entity42 pony , @entity41 , and the girls ride around the paddock			0

it 's touristy , but cute			2
one day we organise a cookery lesson at neighbouring @entity79 , owned by the same family			2
we meet cossimo the chef in the huge underground limestone cavern that was the 18th - century olive oil pressing room			1
we start with bowls of flour that @entity86 , my wife , and the girls take great pleasure in mixing and kneading			0
@entity16 climbs on the ball of dough			0
pasta way to do it : @entity94 and family try their hand at pasta making in an 18th - century olive oil pressing room ' have you seen that technique before ? ' i ask @entity104			1
' no , it 's a first			2
' we shape pizzas and panzerotti stuffed with tomato and mozzarella - the @entity51 version of a calzone / pastry hybrid - plus a chocolate version for the children , before trying our hand at pasta			2
we make the @entity51 classic ear - shaped orecchiette and a taglioni that @entity15 takes great pleasure in pushing through the pasta machine			2

it proves as much fun as the horses			0
first stop is a mozzarella farm			1

the cheese - maker twists up mozzarella and ricotta - stuffed burrata and we dig in at the tasting table			1
next up is @entity140 to see the old stone olive press and try its famed oil			1
from there we pedal on to the nearby fishing village of @entity145 for a late lunch at the @entity147			0
owned by four consecutive generations of local fishermen and serving only fish , the @entity147 may just be one of my all - time favourite restaurants			0
