one of the three pilots on board a helicopter @entity3 falsely claimed to have been travelling on when it was gunned down @entity5 has given his version of the three days he spent with the millionaire @entity8 news anchor			1
@entity3 , anchor and managing editor of the flagship @entity12 show , had been under fire for 11 days after being called out on the overblown story by indignant veterans of the 2003 invasion			1
bosses at the network finally suspended @entity3 without pay for six months acted after deciding his own decision to remove himself from anchoring for ' several days ' over the ' completely inappropriate ' claim was not enough			2
now @entity24 pilot and father of four @entity26 , 44 , has revealed what really happened on board the @entity30 aircraft , saying the aircraft did not come under fire at any time during the completely routine mission and that he and @entity3 passed the time complaining about their cars			1
the decision was announced by the @entity47 president of @entity48 , @entity46 , right @entity26 said he is reluctant to join those lambasting @entity3 for his version of events , but told @entity54 's @entity53 that he just wants the truth to be revealed			1
' whatever @entity3 may or may not be guilty of or what he may or may not have said , that 's a reflection on him			2
it does n't have anything to do with me ... i did my job , and part of my job was to take @entity3 and his crew on a mission , ' he told the newspaper			1
@entity3 ' story of being on board a @entity30 helicopter during the 2003 @entity5 invasion has reportedly changed over the years , but on january 30 he repeated the often - told version about the aircraft being hit by gun and rocket fire and being forced to make an emergency landing			1
the pilot , @entity3 claimed , was later given a @entity77 - a medal awarded by the @entity80 military for those injured or killed while serving			2
@entity26 says that at no point did the helicopter take fire and said he was not awarded a @entity77			1
instead he says that during the mission a call came over the radio saying a @entity30 helicopter that left the base in @entity90 30 minutes before @entity26 's aircraft had been hit by bullets and a rocket - propelled grenade , and that the pilot of that helicopter had landed the aircraft safely			1
news of that attack had forced @entity26 and another @entity30 pilot to turn their aircraft around in the middle of a sandstorm , which took between 15 minutes and half an hour , but he said nobody was hurt - even though the fear of attack and the reduced visibility made it a ' pretty big emotional event '			1
boots on the ground : @entity3 , pictured above covering @entity5 , was pulled up by veterans on an overblown story of being aboard a helicopter hit by an rpg - which it emerged he was not on at all in danger ? @entity3 also gave a contentious account of his time covering @entity120 's war with @entity121 - once claiming there was rocket fire ' just underneath ' the helicopter ( above ) he was riding in - a detail that was notably absent from his reporting at the time for the bulk of the mission , @entity26 said , @entity3 and his two @entity8 colleagues sat around the army 's desert camp chatting among themselves and with soldiers			1
' we were sitting around talking about cars and i was complaining about the poor service i got at a @entity138 dealership , ' @entity26 said			1
@entity3 commented about the poor service he got at a @entity140 dealership , ' he added			2
' i realized we 're from two different worlds			0
he 's a millionaire and i 'm just a grunt , ' @entity26 said			2
' we 're not from the same neighborhood			0
' after retelling his @entity5 story on january 30 , @entity143 was called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory - grabbing			1
@entity3 issued an on - air apology - and said he had been in a ' following ' helicopter			1
this detail too came under scrutiny , and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind , as @entity26 has now confirmed			1
stand - in : @entity157 , right , will fill the nightly news anchor 's chair while @entity3 is suspended in a note sent to @entity8 staff , @entity46 , the president of @entity8 's news division , described his puffed - up retellings of events from 2003 as ' wrong and completely inappropriate '			2
in the mean time @entity157 , who has already covered two broadcasts for @entity3 , will sit in the nightly news anchor 's chair			2
the scandal began on january 30 , when @entity3 repeated an often - told anecdote about being on board a @entity30 helicopter during the 2003 @entity5 invasion			1
he said that he was on board a chopper which got hit by a rocket - propelled grenade and was forced to land			0
in fact , he was on a completely different helicopter			0
after being called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory - grabbing , @entity3 issued an on - air apology - and said he had been in a ' following ' helicopter			1
this detail too came under scrutiny , and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind			0
dead body ? another @entity3 anecdote - of seeing a dead body float down a street in @entity194 's @entity193 during @entity195 , has now also been called into question his plight worsened after other grand , personal stories - from @entity195 , @entity120 's 2006 war with @entity121 , and even a childhood tale of being mugged - were also called into question			0
in her note , @entity46 wrote : ' we have decided today to suspend @entity3 as managing editor and @entity205 for six months			0
' the suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately			0
' ' while on @entity12 on friday , january 30 , 2015 , @entity3 misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the @entity209 in 2003			2
' it then became clear that on other occasions @entity3 had done the same while telling that story in other venues			0
this was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in @entity3 's position			0
' in addition , we have concerns about comments that occurred outside @entity48 while @entity3 was talking about his experiences in the field			2
currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in @entity5 , a number of @entity3 ' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny @entity228 , @entity229 , 1970s in a 2011 interview , @entity3 recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy			1
however in a 2005 @entity236 interview , @entity3 had claimed to save not one but two puppies			0
in the same @entity236 interview @entity3 also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling @entity242 trees in the sleepy @entity229 town in which he grew up			0
a number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ' stuck a .38 - caliber in my face '			0
@entity209 , 2003 over the years @entity3 has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army chinook helicopter during the @entity209 in 2003			2
last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire , an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present			1
@entity3 issued an on - air apology and wrote on @entity260 : ' nobody 's trying to steal anyone 's valor			0
' @entity195 , 2005 @entity3 has told several stories about his experiences reporting from @entity194			0
he has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city 's @entity193 â€“ even though the area was n't flooded			0
the accuracy of other @entity195 claims , including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ' overrun ' with gangs , have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster			0
@entity120 , 2006 in a 2007 interview with @entity282 , @entity3 recalled ' katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in ' during a trip to @entity120			1
in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire ' six miles away '			0
@entity291 , 2006 a @entity293 vet accused @entity3 of lying to skip an event honoring members of the @entity296 so that he could appear on @entity297			0
on the day of the @entity300 event the @entity48 anchor told organizers that a ' pressing engagement ' meant he would n't be able speak at the dinner , but later that evening he appeared in a walk - on role on @entity297 's @entity305 .			0

@entity307 was one of three pilots on board @entity30 aircraft with @entity3
he says aircraft did not come under fire at any point during @entity5 mission
another helicopter 30 minutes ahead was hit by bullets and grenades
that attack led @entity26 to turn helicopter around and make a rapid landing
@entity324 touched down during heavy sandstorm , although nobody was hurt
@entity3 is said to have spent rest of the trip talking to soldiers about cars
