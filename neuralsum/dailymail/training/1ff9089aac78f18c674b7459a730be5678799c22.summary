click here to find out more from our brilliant @entity2 service - including @entity5 's heat map @entity6 went out of the @entity7 with a display of heroic defiance which shook @entity10 , the new contenders for the crown , to their aristocratic roots			1
the unfancied @entity14 blazed another thrilling episode into this magnificent @entity7 even after @entity17 ’s @entity16 was sent off early in the second half			1
that decision by the @entity21 referee could not discourage @entity6 from going desperately close to overcoming a @entity23 team who have become many people ’s latest fancy to return here to the @entity28 for the final			1
a lot of hearts went out with @entity6 as their electric counter-attacks had @entity35 ’ men scrambling to keep them out			1
@entity38 goalkeeper @entity37 was almost as busy in the @entity23 goal as the flying @entity40 at the other end			2
what had begun as a rather tame affair finished with an explosion of chances in both goalmouths			2
@entity48 bore it was not			2
as close as they came : @entity50 hits the bar as @entity6 scramble to clear their lines flying in : @entity16 goes in hard , with the @entity6 captain 's studs running down @entity57 's left leg in agony : @entity57 lies injured after a nasty clash with @entity16 anxious moments : @entity10 players surround the stricken @entity57 before @entity16 sees red for a poor tackle marching orders : @entity16 is sent off by referee @entity63 after raking his studs down @entity57 's left leg @entity6 : @entity40 8 , @entity65 6.5 , @entity66 7.5 , @entity67 6 , @entity68 6 , a @entity69 4.5 , @entity70 6 , @entity71 5.5 ( @entity72 89 ) , @entity73 6 ( @entity74 63 ) , @entity75 7 ( @entity76 82 ) , @entity69 8			1

when the breathless end came , @entity10 were heading for a date with @entity114 , @entity6 for home			1
however , the concept of this @entity23 team as ready to surpass the likes of @entity119 and @entity120 was not given any added traction.beneath all the thrills there a was a back story on which the @entity23 are building their aspirations			0
the battle for @entity99 was being joined in earnest by @entity127 and @entity128 , even as @entity10 breathlessly awaited a further sign that this man is riding a magic carpet similar to that on which @entity133 bore them to @entity7 glory			1
the @entity23 regard @entity137 , the hot southern wind which comes to them from the deserts of @entity141 , as being full of mystery and @entity144 superstition was heightened when @entity133 , born in @entity145 of @entity147 parents , arose to spirit them to their first world championship in @entity152 in 1998			0
sixteen years later @entity99 , born in @entity153 to parents from a deeply spiritual corner of @entity147 , is emerging as their exotic new talisman			0
to support that belief , he went into this match against @entity6 ’s hopefuls only one behind the four - goal leaders in the race for the @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			1
not that he looked like catching them on this outing			0
still the @entity23 see it as another positive omen that on the very day they formally closed out qualification for the last 16 @entity133 has accepted his first managerial appointment , at the club which is determined to keep @entity99			2
less romantically , the recruitment of @entity99 ’s idol as coach of their second team is a piece of clever opportunism by @entity127			0
the prospect of working in the same environment as @entity133 , on a daily basis , would make it all the more of a wrench for @entity99 to up sticks and move to north @entity186			0
a persuasion perhaps as great as the hugely enriching new contract with which @entity127 are preparing to welcome him back to @entity190 from this @entity7			0
it counters the attraction to @entity99 of playing under @entity193 , the iconic @entity23 manager at the @entity194			0
@entity196 fans optimistic about knockout stage just wide : @entity5 went close with this late header flying lesson : @entity74 takes a trip under pressure from @entity57 hands on : @entity99 gets to grips with @entity67 holding on : @entity40 of @entity6 makes a save as @entity10 threaten to break the deadlock @entity205 : the significant others of @entity104 , @entity97 , @entity92 , @entity90 and @entity103 enjoy a night out at the @entity28 @entity128 are hoping also that one of their moles in the @entity23 camp , @entity96 , can excite @entity99 to the possibility of them partnering each other in the @entity212 the way they work together for @entity10			1
albeit not from the off in this game , in which @entity99 was nudged forward positionally to orthodox centre - forward and @entity96 rested			0
but these players will not be able to resist comparing two contracts , @entity96 ’s existing deal at @entity128 and the bonanza being offered for @entity99 to keep playing his club football in @entity190			0
and it has to be doubtful if @entity128 will be either willing or able to match such astronomic wages , especially if @entity99 pushes them yet higher with more goals in these finals			0
such has @entity99 ’s impact been on this shimmering tournament already that the @entity23 have as good as forgotten the grief which consumed their nation when @entity230 was taken from them by injury			0
@entity230 , after all , had been described by @entity133 as ‘ the new jewel of @entity23 football ’			0
but this team came into this tournament sparkling without him , so brilliantly in their first two games that they have begun daring to dream of winning their second @entity7			0
@entity6 have brought a little perspective to that notion			1
they entered the @entity28 expecting that if they were to join @entity10 they would have to resist being demolished the way the @entity244 were by @entity10 in game two of this group			1
@entity248 , despite that five - goal hammering , were in pole position to follow @entity10 through as they took on a demoralised @entity251			1
@entity6 gleaned hope that they might match the @entity244 result from the practice of @entity256 rotating his players from match to match			1
high riser : @entity99 shrugs off the attentions of @entity65 to go close in the first half high boot : @entity90 gets some studs on his torso during the @entity28 encounter hard in : @entity95 skips a tackle from @entity71 touching distance : @entity57 manages to escape the attentions of @entity16 holding on : @entity37 collects a loose ball to deny @entity6 a goalscoring chance @entity103 also took a turn on the bench , while @entity275 ’s contribution to this @entity7 was expanded by @entity276 being given a first @entity7 game here in place of @entity104 in midfield			1
a pity club - mates @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284 were not still here to see it			0
@entity287 announced his arrival on this lofty stage with a feisty tussle with @entity16			1
of the @entity212 contingent on view , @entity291 ’s @entity98 threatened in the early exchanges and @entity37 came out smartly to smother at the feet of @entity6 ’s other @entity69			1
he was to be even busier later			0
and while @entity297 was not playing badly , @entity296 continued to stretch the @entity23 defence , notably with a close - range header which @entity37 again did well to keep out			0
clearing his lines : @entity91 removes the danger as @entity296 advances aerial battle : @entity6 's @entity66 heads the ball to his teammates as @entity10 's @entity50 defends a cause for concern : @entity296 left the field after suffering an injury in the first half marked man : @entity312 keeps a close eye on dangerman @entity99 telescopic leg : @entity92 sticks out a limb to deny @entity296 @entity6 kept pressing into the second half , even after @entity69 ’s 55th minute sending off			1
after @entity40 brilliantly turned a close range effort from @entity319 lookalike @entity50 against a post , the head bandaged @entity71 went clear on the counter , only to scoop his shot wide of @entity37			0
a previously somewhat tepid game was now fully ignited – although the @entity23 still marginally held the upper hand - this firefight was not in their script			0
@entity37 had to pull out a huge save from substitute @entity74 to keep it goalless			2
in the end it was @entity10 who were grateful for the final whistle , @entity10 who celebrated , @entity10 who will field their best team from now			2
but it was @entity6 who the crowd rose to cheer .			2

@entity10 and @entity6 fought out an entertaining goalless draw at the @entity28
@entity16 was sent off for a *shocking* *challenge* on @entity57
but the sending off *galvanised* @entity6 , who impressed in the second half and forged several chances
@entity10 did not get out of second gear and will face @entity114 in the round of 16 after topping @entity350
