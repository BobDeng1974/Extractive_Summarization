when @entity1 quit as manager of @entity3 last summer he cited the prospect of @entity6 militant rockets flying over the club training ground as a reason to leave			1
as reasons go , it ’s as good as it gets			2
the man that succeeded him though , was undeterred			2
indeed , former @entity16 coach @entity15 has never been afraid of taking bold steps			1
at @entity20 , when trusted assistant to @entity19 , he was the man who encouraged @entity19 to move to @entity16 when the opportunity arose			1
‘ i was a @entity16 fan , ’ says @entity15			1
‘ as a boy i had seen their team in 1975 , with @entity25 and @entity26 , beat @entity27 9 - 1 and it stuck with me			2
when i heard @entity19 had the chance to go , i said he had to take it			1
’ @entity15 ( right ) alongside @entity19 during their time at @entity16 @entity15 was assistant manager under @entity19 at @entity20 and @entity16 equally , when he felt @entity19 had lost sight of what made their partnership so good , @entity15 left @entity16			1
their friendship was fractured and never repaired but @entity15 used those early principles to forge his own management career			1
when @entity3 sports director @entity39 called about moving to @entity40 , @entity15 sensed an opportunity ; not one of danger and trepidation but a challenge he could relish			1
‘ it is similar to when i was a young man in the 70s and 80s in the @entity49 country in @entity50 , ’ says @entity15			1
‘ i was living with the threat of @entity52 , the @entity49 separatists , and bombs every day			2
people would call and ask ‘ ’ are you ok there ? ’ ’ and you ’d say ‘ ’ yes i ’m off to the park ’ ’ or ‘ ’ i ’m having a cup of coffee ’ ’			2
in my mind , life was normal			2
@entity15 takes training at @entity3 ‘ @entity40 is different to the north of @entity66			1
if conflict starts it is normally on the @entity68 or @entity69 but not so much here			2
‘ it has been peaceful since the ceasefire was agreed in august			2
i can lead a normal life here			0
as normal as in @entity73 or @entity74			0
the quality of life here is amazing			0
i will take my son to play tennis later and on thursday i am going to the opera			0
’ today , @entity15 is eating lunch at a bistro on the @entity40 promenade			1
he looks trim , sharply dressed and sunglasses protect him from the glare of bright sunshine as the @entity87 laps over the busy beach			0
he has embraced @entity39 ’s challenge			0
@entity3 have won one trophy , the @entity91 , and a 2 - 1 victory over @entity93 on monday means they are still on course for a domestic treble for the first time in their 109 year history			1
it is clear the methods @entity15 practised at @entity101 and since with last club @entity102 in @entity103 are having an effect			1
‘ one thing i learned is that you have to listen to your staff , ’ @entity15 says pointedly			1
he succeeded former boss @entity1 as manager of @entity3 in @entity66 @entity15 ( third left ) was part of the @entity16 set up that helped them to @entity113 victory in 2005 ‘ you may have your own ideas and make a different decision but the people around you are there for a reason and it ’s important you account for that in your management and coaching			1
‘ expectation is high here because of the club ’s history but i ’m not afraid of that			1
you have to take responsibility			0
it ’s the evolution of a team , increasing the levels			0
i set a target of winning the treble early on and that brings pressure but that ’s a pressure i ’m happy with			2
' the @entity66 people are passionate about their football and it ’s a release in many ways from what else goes on in life here			0
’ football remains @entity66 ’s most popular sport along with basketball and swimming			0
@entity66 top their group in the @entity146 qualifiers and host @entity147 on saturday			0
@entity3 have four players in the squad , one , attacking midfielder @entity150 , has been the subject of interest from @entity153 and @entity154 while @entity155 tried to sign him in january			1
he has scored 31 goals this season already			0
@entity3 manager @entity15 giving orders to his team ‘ it ’s a gift for @entity3 to have him at the club , ’ says @entity15			1
‘ a player with the right character to take this club one step forward			2
he could certainly succeed in the @entity164			0
’ the 52 - year - old @entity15 retains a strong interest in @entity167 football where he is also drawing attention from clubs looking at foreign coaches			1
he has kept his house , a stone ’s throw away from the @entity174 in @entity175 , and is still in contact with the likes of @entity178 and @entity179			0
they met up for lunch on a recent trip back to the @entity183			0
‘ we had a glass of wine and talked about football , ’ says @entity15			1
‘ they are great characters			0
@entity178 is like a sponge for information , he soaks up everything			0
i can remember at @entity16 when he was in the treatment room and he was having a debate about who played right - back in the 1974 fa cup final			1
' he approaches everything with such passion			0
i can see him coaching one day			0
@entity179 is also so passionate about the game and the project he is taking on in @entity202			0
when i arrived at @entity16 i think they were both a little unsure ; they ’d give their opinions but they listened and had respect for what we wanted to do			1
' it made them think more about what they were doing as players and they are great students of the game			0
their personalities are strong and they helped coaches to set the standard at @entity16			1
for them the club came first			2
’ @entity15 has backed his friend and former @entity16 defender @entity178 to move into coaching the former @entity16 assistant is also still in contact with @entity223 captain @entity179 while his bond with many of the friends he made in @entity16 is intact , @entity15 admits regret that his relationship with @entity19 remains broken			1
the pair won promotion at @entity230 , two @entity50 titles with @entity20 and the @entity113 at @entity16			1
‘ it ’s sad that we have n’t spoken			0
we had a lot of very good moments and it ’s better to remember those than the bad , life is too short			0
’ @entity15 though is making confident strides as the main man			2
after @entity19 , he took time out to learn from coaches such as @entity241 and @entity242 , had a short spell as director of football at @entity27 and spent time with @entity245			1
‘ i ’ve found it a natural transition , ’ he says			0
‘ i needed my own project			0
it ’s important that clubs have a model like @entity245 where even if change in personnel comes , and sometimes frequently , the model , the belief remains			0
’ and could he see himself in @entity167 again soon ? ‘ it ’s the place i enjoy the most and my sons still consider @entity167 home			0
i would love that one day but for now my focus is @entity3 - then maybe @entity167 can be my next chapter			2

@entity15 took over from @entity1 at @entity3
