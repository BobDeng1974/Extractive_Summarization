after months of rumours , @entity0 has officially launched its @entity0 at @entity3			1
designed to be used as self - contained social network within companies , the site has begun rolling out apps to a select number of ' partner ' firms			1
facebook at @entity12 is available on the web , @entity14 and @entity15 and the @entity17 tech giant described it as ' a separate experience that gives employees the ability to connect and collaborate efficiently using @entity0 tools			1
the @entity17 tech giant described it as ' a separate experience that gives employees the ability to connect and collaborate efficiently using @entity0 tools ' reports claim that the site features a @entity35 , groups , messages and events , like the original social network			1
privacy wise , @entity0 at @entity12 will only be accessible by people within a company			1
and the tech giant said an employee ’s @entity46 information is ' safe , secure , confidential and completely separate from their personal profile			1
' @entity0 confirmed yesterday that it will start placing clickable warnings over extreme ' graphic ' content on its site			1
the warnings , which are placed over flagged images and videos , state that the content might ' shock offend and upset '			0
the move comes after the @entity17 social media site came under fire for failing to impose greater controls on disturbing images			0
the warning asks the user ' are you sure you want to see this ? '			0
content with the warning will not be seen by users under 18 and videos will also not autoplay like other newsfeed items			0
videos to come under the new measures include footage of the death of @entity74 policeman , @entity73 , who was shot in @entity75 during the @entity77 attacks			0
when the rumours first originated in november , sources said the site would likely launch without adverts			0
however , this may mean @entity0 charges companies to use the app as an alternative way to make money			2
by launching an enterprise version of the site , @entity0 is also taking aim at @entity90 , as well as @entity92 's @entity91			1
@entity0 staff were said to have been given a beta version of the ad - free @entity0 to test in december			2
a study last year found that more than 54 per cent of offices currently block @entity0 on work computers to stop it distracting users			1
in october , @entity0 reported its quarterly profit nearly doubled to £ 511 million ( $ 802 million ) , but saw its stock hit hard after outlining a plan to invest heavily in the future instead of using its short - term riches			2
' we are going to continue preparing for the future by investing aggressively , connecting everyone , understanding the world , and building the next - generation in computing platforms , ' said boss @entity113 at the time			0
' we have a long journey ahead			0
' the 10 - year - old site currently has 1.35 billion monthly active users worldwide , while @entity90 has more than 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories			1
when the rumours first originated in november , sources said the site would likely launch without adverts			0
however , this may mean @entity0 charges companies to use the app as an alternative way to make money			2
by launching an enterprise version of the site , @entity0 is taking aim at professional network @entity90 according to the professional site , users sign up to join @entity90 at a rate of more than two new members per second			1
the site lets professionals ' connect ' with each other to form networks			1
it also has its own messaging service and news feed			0
but @entity146 , global product manager , collaboration , at software firm @entity144 is n't convinced : ' we already know enough about @entity0 that we can start making conclusions as to where this will end			2
@entity0 has been looking to expand its services for year			2
recently , it unveiled an app called room that lets people chat anonymously in virtual ' rooms , ' evoking the chat services from the early days of the web			1
it is also testing a feature that lets users of the leading social network make purchases by simply pressing an on - screen ' buy ' button			1
meanwhile , @entity0 completed its multibillion - dollar deal for mobile messaging application @entity165 last year			2
and in november , it revamped its privacy policy to make it easier to understand , after years of criticism			0
it has also introduced tools to help people manage what they share on the site			2
the site 's security was heightened at the end of last year when it rolled out default encryption , too			2
' this is the same site where members share everything and anything with friends			0
' people of all ages leave privacy at the door when they sign - in to @entity0			2
' you can essentially equate @entity0 to the party guy you want to hang out with on friday night who 's funny , popular and a bit crazy - but would you want to work with him ? ' it seems @entity0 is not just looking to build another social network to compete with the likes of @entity90			1
' instead , it is planning to offer enterprise collaboration			0
' keeping the workplace it environment safe and secure is a huge priority for it departments			0
with this in mind , it 's unlikely that @entity0 will be able to stop it from feeling comfortable with the safety of their information			1
