@entity0 scored the winner as @entity2 came back twice against @entity3 to win a five - goal thriller at the @entity5 on sunday night			1
for a while it looked as if @entity9 loanee @entity8 would derail @entity2 ’s pursuit of the league leaders but , with a little help from @entity13 - who also scored - and @entity14 - who made two of @entity2 ’s three goals - @entity0 ensured the home side took all three points			1
@entity2 almost broke the deadlock on 12 minutes when @entity20 intelligently pulled the ball back for @entity14 , who shot first time from the edge of the area only for @entity25 to fingertip it away for a corner			1
@entity3 were coming into the game on a run of 18 matches unbeaten and looked determined to not lose that record at the @entity5			1
for @entity2 , midfielder @entity33 - called up for @entity48 - had started the game brightly and when @entity54 chopped him down @entity0 had the chance to test @entity25 but his free - kick was headed out for a corner			1
@entity0 then so nearly found @entity47 with a cross to the back post that the midfielder just failed to make contact with			0
@entity2 went close again and once more it was @entity14 who was denied			0
@entity20 ’ pass was laid off by @entity33 and the former @entity84 striker ’s curling shot went just past @entity25 ’s left - hand post			2
the lively @entity33 continued to pose a threat and , when he was chopped down by @entity87 , the midfielder was booked			0
@entity89 had only conceded nine goals in the league but on the half - hour mark they let in @entity93 and it was the @entity9 loanee who got it			2
@entity8 wants to go back to @entity9 at the end of the season and he did his chances no harm diverting @entity102 ’s shot past @entity41 after @entity43 ’s poor clearance had run straight to the full back			1
@entity3 , who will face @entity2 twice more in the @entity106 semi-finals in the coming weeks , increasingly looked to have the measure of their rivals			2
but just as it looked as if they would make it to half - time in front , @entity13 struck with his 21st goal of the season			1
@entity0 played in @entity33 whose shot was parried for the @entity118 to convert the rebound			1
@entity8 runs off with his arms aloft in celebration after giving @entity3 the lead after 30 minutes @entity0 looks down to the ground in frustration after @entity2 concede a 30th - minute goal against @entity3 @entity3 players runs to the corner and embrace one another after their opening goal at the @entity5 @entity14 ( left ) tries to take on @entity3 goalkeeper @entity25 during the first half at the @entity5 on sunday @entity14 ( left ) tries to kick the ball over his own head as @entity3 's @entity52 looks on the tide however had not turned completely and with @entity3 playing the same swift counter-attacking football in the second half they were soon back in front			1
@entity42 had n’t put a foot wrong all night but lost possession to @entity140 and he crossed for @entity141 to score			0
it what was now developing into the one of the games of the season - and @entity2 ’s response was almost immediate			2
@entity47 played @entity14 in behind @entity102 and he crossed for @entity0			0
when the @entity147 ’s effort was saved @entity33 converted the rebound			0
two minutes later @entity2 were ahead and again @entity14 was the provider , nudging the ball to @entity0 on the edge of the area for @entity2 ’s top scorer to sweep the home side into the lead			1
it was his 342nd goal in his last 342 games for the club			0
@entity3 still would n’t lie down and @entity54 scrambled the ball in at the back post only for a linesman ’s flag to cut short the visitors ’ joy			0
@entity2 then thought they had won a penalty as @entity25 charged into @entity13 as the @entity118 was through on goal			2
perhaps judging that he had already gone to ground as he lunged to send the ball past the keeper , the referee did not point to the spot and @entity14 just failed to head in at the back post as the attack continued with @entity13 down			0
now finally in front , @entity2 were not going to let it slip			0
with @entity176 on the horizon they have found a team spirit that has helped them beat @entity179 twice since the turn of the year and now overcome their toughest test of the season so far at the @entity5			0
and , on top of all that , @entity0 ’s looks back to his imperious best			0
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity3 's @entity8 ( right ) compete for the ball during the league match at the @entity5 @entity13 of @entity2 points to the sky in celebration of his first equaliser for @entity2 at the @entity5 on sunday @entity2 players huddle around @entity13 ( third right ) after the @entity118 scored their first equaliser on sunday @entity193 ( right ) places the ball into the net for @entity3 's second goal at @entity20 of @entity2 ( left ) looks on @entity33 ( right ) lifts the ball over the @entity3 goalkeeper to score @entity2 's second equaliser on sunday night @entity0 ( left ) is congratulated by his @entity2 team - mates after the @entity147 scored his side 's third goal @entity2 boss @entity203 gestures to his players during the first half of the encounter at the @entity5			1
