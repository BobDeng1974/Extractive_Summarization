by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 01:36 est , 2 may 2012 advice : transport secretary @entity2 the @entity3 will today urge young drivers and women motorists to have ‘ black boxes ’ fitted in their cars to reduce sky - high insurance premiums by as much as half			1
@entity2 will say that insurance costs increasingly bear ‘ little relationship to the real world ’ , revealing figures showing that young male drivers now pay an average of almost £ 3,000 a year			1
the technology , similar to the recording devices used in aircraft , can measure speed , braking , acceleration , cornering and the time of day of a motorist ’s journey			0
miss @entity2 will suggest wider use of the technology which she says allows drivers to reduce their bills by up to 50 per cent by limiting night - time driving and demonstrating safe driving behaviour			1
insurers argue that young motorists should be subjected to a strict curfew on late night driving to cut road deaths and serious injuries			1
under - 25s are more prone to accidents while driving late at night and early in the morning			2
but miss @entity2 will rule out a blanket curfew , preferring the use of black boxes which could help reduce accidents as well as insurance costs			1
ministers believe women drivers , who are statistically safer than men , could also benefit			0
high tech : black box technology is already used in planes to record complete flight details currently , they pay less than men but their bills will increase from december , thanks to an @entity54 ruling preventing gender discrimination in insurance			2
miss @entity2 said : ‘ the government has already taken tough action to ban referral fees , reform no - win no - fee rules and crack down on fraudulent whiplash claims			2
but i think we can go further			0
‘ why is it , when the overwhelming majority of @entity66 young drivers are amongst the safest in the world and we are seeing faster reductions in casualties for this age group than for all drivers as a whole , that premiums are still sky high ? @entity75 : @entity76 ‘ there is no getting away from it : the cost of car insurance is bearing increasingly little relationship to the real world			1
’ the average motor insurance bill today is £ 410 – a 17 per cent rise on last year			2
the average premiums for young drivers are £ 2,977 for a young male driver and £ 1,682 for a female			0
drivers are scored between one and five on a range of behaviours , and receive money back on their insurance if they drive safely			0
estimates suggest that young drivers should see their annual premiums fall by 20 per cent			0
an analysis of 10,000 young driver claims by the co-op suggests that those with telematics or ‘ black box ’ insurance are 20 per cent less likely to have a car crash than those with standard insurance			1
they also tend to be involved in less serious road accidents , as the cost of a typical insurance claim from a customer with the box is 30 per cent less than from a customer without			0
@entity112 , of the co-op , said : ‘ we can see that motorists with this type of insurance are genuinely driving better than those without it			0

@entity2 believes insurance costs increasingly bear ‘ little relationship to the real world ’
suggests the technology could cut bills by up to 50 per cent
could prove to insurers drivers safe behaviour and limited night - time driving
