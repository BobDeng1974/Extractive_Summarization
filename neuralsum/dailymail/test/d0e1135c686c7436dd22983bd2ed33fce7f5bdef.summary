women are undervaluing themselves and asking for less pay than they should – widening the gender pay gap , it is claimed			1
@entity4 found that women applying for jobs through recruitment agencies remain coy about asking for asking a decent wage package			0
a study found women routinely ask for £ 4,000 less for a typical job , but that this widens to up to £ 10,000 less in more senior industries such as accountancy			1
gender gap widening : a study found women routinely ask for £ 4,000 less for a typical job , but that this widens to up to £ 10,000 less in more senior industries such as accountancy on average , women ask for almost a fifth less than men , rising to nearly a third less in some financial sectors			1
not only do they ask for less than their male colleagues , but they are also asking for below what they could typically expect to earn in their industry			0
new research from @entity31 found that female applicants state their ‘ anticipated salary ’ as £ 19,900 , on average , while men asked for £ 23,800			2
expected salaries varied by industry with women asking for 29 per cent less than men in accountancy , 22 per cent less in banking , 21 per cent less in the energy sector and 18 per cent lower in education			1
a qualified male accountant expected to earn £ 47,000 in their next role compared to just £ 36,400 for women with the same experience			1
the gender gap narrowed in the manufacturing industry and the legal sector to just 9 per cent			2
and in the it and security industry , women actually asked for higher pay , albeit just 2 per cent more – reversing the trend			2
the findings were released to coincide with @entity57 today , to raise awareness of the gender pay gap			1
@entity60 and the @entity61 had the largest gender difference in expected salaries , while @entity64 had the smallest			1
@entity65 , of @entity67 jobs website @entity31 , said : ‘ our latest research shows a major difference in the pay expectations of men and women			1
‘ whatever your gender , it ’s important to never undervalue your worth at work , so if you ’re thinking about looking for a new job			2
selling themselves short : @entity60 and the @entity61 had the largest gender difference in expected salaries , while @entity64 had the smallest , according to the research from @entity31 ‘ if you ’re happy in your current job but feel you ’re not getting paid enough , then it ’s time to take on one of the tougher tasks we all face whilst in employment – negotiating a pay rise			1
’ the study also showed ‘ a stark contrast ’ between what women expect to get paid and what ’s actually on offer			0
using the website ’s ‘ average salary checker ’ tool , @entity31 found many female applicants asked for less than their industry ’s average			0
women on @entity101 ( @entity102 ) said that female workers were kept in the dark about what their male colleagues were earning , making it hard to know how much to request			0
@entity108 , of @entity102 – which campaigns for more women in the boardroom – said : ‘ i think it is unrealistic to suggest that women are expecting less when pay levels are often not transparent in organisations			0
‘ i believe it is the responsibility of the company , not the employees , to make than men and women are paid same			0
‘ research has also shown that women need to be very careful about asking for more money			0
‘ stereotypical unconscious biases are alive and kicking in the @entity67 which means that women who ask for pay rises are often negatively treated thereafter , having been viewed as aggressive			0
‘ men on the other hand are not only expected but encouraged to challenge pay and opportunities			0
