by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:40 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 14:40 est , 6 june 2013 @entity3 , the 10 - year - old girl in desperate need of a lung transplant moved closer to that goal when the national organ transplant network complied with a judge 's order to place her on the adult waiting list			1
the @entity11 added her to the list on wednesday night after @entity15 district judge @entity14 's original ruling on june 5th @entity15 @entity17 secretary @entity16 said on thursday			1
the little girl , also remains on the priority list for a lung from a pediatric donor , @entity16 said			1
however , her family , through their official spokeswoman , said @entity3 's condition had worsened through today			1
battle : ten - year - old @entity3 has been on the waiting list for a lung transplant for 18 months @entity3 's parents had challenged existing transplant policy that made children under 12 wait for pediatric lungs to become available , or be offered lungs donated by adults after adolescents and adults on the waiting list had been considered			1
' we are beyond thrilled , ' @entity37 , the girl 's mother , told @entity40 on wednesday			2
' obviously we still need a match			0
' the ruling applied only to @entity3 , who has end - stage cystic fibrosis and has been awaiting a transplant at the @entity45			1
an expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds			0
in this may 30 , 2013 file photo provided by the @entity3 family , @entity3 , center , celebrates the 100th day of her stay in @entity45 with her father , @entity53 , left , and mother , @entity54 loved : her mother @entity54 , pictured , has just learned her daughter has a chance to live - after being approved for the adult organ transplant waiting list lung transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants , and children fare worse than adults , which is one reason for the existing policy , said dr. @entity66 , a bioethicist at @entity67			1
he called it troubling , and perhaps precedent - setting , for a judge to overrule that medical judgment , and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who do n't like their place on the waiting list			1
' i 'm not sure i want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside , ' @entity66 said			0
@entity3 's family , who live @entity84 in suburban @entity85 , filed suit wednesday			2
the @entity87 say pediatric lungs are rarely donated , so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations			2
@entity14 suspended the age limit in the nation 's transplant rules for 10 days for @entity3 , who has been at the @entity85 hospital for three months			1
a june 14 hearing on the request has been scheduled for a broader injunction			0
holding on : @entity3 's mother said her eldest daughter has just three to five weeks left to live support : @entity3 , who has been living in hospital since february , is pictured with her three younger siblings nationwide , about 1,700 people are on the waiting list for a lung transplant , including 31 children under age 11 , according to the @entity11			1
@entity16 had declined to become involved in the case earlier this week , despite urgent pleas from several @entity113 congressmen			2
@entity16 said there were three other children at @entity45 alone in the same condition as @entity3			1
she has called for a review of pediatric transplant policies amid the higher death rates for pediatric patients , but the @entity87 say @entity3 does n't have time for that			2
@entity3 's doctors , one of whom testified wednesday at an emergency hearing before @entity14 , believe they can perform a successful transplant on her with adult lungs			1
' she definitely understands things have improved quite a bit , ' the girl 's aunt , @entity129 , said after the ruling			0
the @entity87 ' attorney , @entity134 , said a committee of the organization that sets transplants policy may meet next week and he hoped it would change the policy			0
' i hope that they decide to discontinue it completely for children under 12			0
i wo n't be satisfied until @entity3 receives a set of lungs , ' he said			2
' the risk of her dying until she gets those lungs is high			0
' @entity148 , spokesman for the @entity11 that operates the nation 's transplant network , said he was unaware of any previous court order that overruled a transplant policy			1
' incredibly agonizing ' : @entity15 @entity17 secretary @entity16 told a congressional panel on tuesday that she would n't overrule federal regulations to help save young @entity54 @entity156 : despite her poor prognosis , @entity3 remains upbeat about her chances of getting a transplant fears : @entity54 and @entity161 are now hopeful their daughter 's life will be saved after she was placed on the adult transplant list while many more adult lungs than children 's lungs wind up being donated , the ruling does n't guarantee @entity3 a new set of lungs			1
the matches are based on blood type , the risk of dying , the chance of surviving a transplant and other medical factors			0
the donor lungs would also have to be an appropriate size for her chest			0
@entity148 said some lungs donated from deceased adults have been offered for children 's transplants over the past two years , although he could n't give a number			0
but he said all were turned down by the children 's surgeons			0
the @entity11 system was established to avoid bias in determining who gets organs , thus ensuring that the rich or celebrities , for example , do n't have a better chance , @entity66 noted			0
he said it is transparent , with policies open to public comment and scrutiny before they 're enacted			0
' when a judge steps in and says , ' i do n't like these rules , i think they 're arbitrary , ' they better be very arbitrary or he 's undermining the authority of the whole system			2
why would n't anybody sue ? '			0

the national organ transplant network has complied with a judge 's *unusual* order and placed @entity3 , 10 , on the adult waiting list
she will die in three to five weeks unless she gets a lung transplant
@entity15 health secretary @entity16 refused on tuesday to overrule a federal regulation which states a patient has to 12 to get an adult transplant
