by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale trouble : @entity1 is thought to have riled up @entity2 by speaking to the @entity3 @entity1 , former chief executive and chef de mission of the @entity5 , caused meltdown in the @entity2 camp at the @entity7 by lunchtime on the first day			1
@entity1 , a special advisor to the board of @entity11 , had been directed along with the rest of the hierarchy not to do any media interviews unless it was part of a planned communications strategy			2
but @entity1 , so keen on publicity that he was known as the ‘ celebrity chef ’ during @entity18 , nevertheless went ahead with a @entity20 interview following @entity21 winning @entity11 ’s first gold in the women ’s triathlon			1
and @entity1 showed why he should n’t have been on air when asked who were now the big hopes for @entity2 after @entity29 ’s withdrawal			1
@entity1 , embarrassingly for his colleagues , struggled to name anyone before coming up with a couple , including swimmer @entity33 , who happens to be @entity34			2
@entity1 has since been told by angry @entity2 officials not to make any more media appearances , but may not be able to help himself			1
how long before @entity41 , the parody twitter account that poked fun at @entity1 ’s ‘ whoopwhoop ’ cheerleading during the @entity40 , resurfaces ? @entity42 , the agency that represents both @entity45 athletes @entity43 and @entity46 suspended from the @entity7 for failing drugs tests — understood to possibly be linked to supplements — claims to ‘ focus on ensuring all our talent receive the best possible advice ’			1
however , @entity42 director @entity52 would not comment on what specific advice had been given to his two tarnished runners			0
@entity55 : @entity43 has been provisionally suspended after being charged with an anti-doping violation the @entity3 monopoly of the @entity7 stretches to their legion of sports website operatives taking advantage of questions asked by newspaper reporters , who were finally given their chance to talk to @entity64 and other cyclists after @entity67 and @entity66 had finished their many questions			1
a @entity7 spokeswoman said on friday : ‘ that is not right , ’ and promised to stop the website from invading newspaper territory			2
meanwhile a temporary studio has been built to house the @entity3 breakfast show and main games programming , despite @entity76 having their state - of - the - art @entity77 nearby featuring the biggest tv recording space ever built in @entity34			2
but it does n’t offer the ‘ iconic view ’ of @entity82 that @entity83 wanted			0
the @entity85 newpaper , distributed in central @entity82 on friday , included quotes from former @entity34 @entity88 boss @entity87 — described as the current boss of @entity90 — supporting a @entity92 vote in the referendum			0
@entity87 sadly died last month			0
@entity88 probe @entity95 ’s flop @entity11 manager @entity98 ’s position may be safe after the @entity100 debacle			1
but at least @entity88 chairman @entity101 has reflected in the weeks since the retreat from @entity103 and listened to his board telling him that not everything about that failed expedition can remain unaffected			0
so a working party from the executive will look at whether the massive support network around @entity98 can be improved or offer better value for considerable costs			1
yet operationally the @entity88 could n’t have prepared better or more professionally			0
it was the manager who could n’t get the marginal gains from his chosen squad			0
probe : the @entity88 will investigate whether @entity98 's support team can be improved @entity118 ’s next @entity117 contract , described by manager @entity119 as a formality , is sure to reaffirm clauses in the last deal about the talisman captain having a guaranteed five - year ambassador role at the club when his playing career ends			1
ambassador positions are increasingly a lucrative option for big names with @entity130 ( @entity131 ) , @entity132 ( @entity133 ) and @entity134 ( @entity135 ) three well - paid examples			0
the massive publicity campaign for @entity133 ’s new @entity139 football channel is led by a @entity132 - fronted big idea tv ad that jokingly included disgarded proposals of drone cams for cricket			0
the sensitive drone mention has now gone , with @entity133 insisting the ad has ‘ evolved			0
’ ambassador : @entity118 should be at @entity117 long after his retirement , if he chooses to be			2

@entity1 riled @entity2 by speaking to the @entity3 after @entity21 win at the @entity7 on *thursday*
@entity1 struggled to think of @entity2 hopefuls after @entity29 withdrawal
@entity88 will *decide* whether @entity98 's support network can be improved
@entity118 's next contract likely to reaffirm clause for five - year ambassadorial role at @entity117 when career ends
