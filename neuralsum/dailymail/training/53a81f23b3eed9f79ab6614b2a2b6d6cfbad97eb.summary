a @entity1 company has implanted microchips in its staff which allows them to use the photocopier , open security doors and even pay for their lunch			1
it is hoped that eventually around 700 employees from the @entity12 hi tech office block in @entity13 may eventually have the chips implanted into the back of their hands			1
the chips use radio - frequency identification ( @entity19 ) and are about the same size as a grain of rice			1
@entity19 chips can already be found in contactless cards - including the @entity49 system which is used by more than 10 million people to pay for public transport in @entity52			1
they are also similar to the chips implanted in pets			2
@entity56 , the chief disruption officer at the @entity1 bio-hacking group @entity57 , which implanted the chips into the @entity12 workers , told @entity60 : ' we already interact with with technology all the time			1
' today it 's a bit messy - we need pin codes and passwords - would n't it be easy to just touch with your hand ? @entity19 chips can already be found in contactless cards including the @entity71 - which is used by more than 10 million people in @entity52 ' we want to be able to understand this technology before big corporates and big government come to us and say everyone should get chipped - the tax authority chip , the @entity78 or @entity79 chip			1
' he says we will then be able to question the way the technology is implemented from a position of much greater knowledge			0
he added that they believe they have only just started discovering all of the things having a microchip could allow us to do			0
in 1999 professor @entity89 , of @entity90 , had a chip implanted into his nervous system and was able to control a robot arm - developed by his colleague dr @entity94 - using thought power			1
it was hoped the technology could radically change the lives of amputees and victims of paralysis			0
last year @entity102 reported a @entity104 man , @entity103 , had one of the chips being use din @entity13 injected into his left hand through a syringe at a @entity111 tattoo parlour			2
it means mr @entity103 can swing his front door open , switch on his lights and store personal information with the flick of his hand			1
' the most obvious thing the chip allows me to do is store my contact information on it , so that i can just touch a phone with @entity124 and pass my information to their phone			2
that is a great party trick , ' he told @entity130			0
' but it can also trigger an action on my phone to turn the house lights off , open a secure door which is set to recognise the chip or i could - and probably will - set up my car ignition to be linked to the chip for keyless entry and start up			2
' mr @entity103 told @entity130 he made the decision to implant the microchip because he had always been interested in the future of technology			0
' i wanted to get the chip implanted to generate discussion , ' he said			2
' it intrigues me that we live in an age where this type of activity is even possible			0
' mr @entity103 said the procedure to implant the microchip was painful , but over quickly			0
' i just needed to be really careful when it was healing over the course of two weeks so that i did n't move it - otherwise it could have travelled in my hand , ' he said			0
