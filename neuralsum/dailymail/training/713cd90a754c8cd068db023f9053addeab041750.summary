@entity1 legend @entity0 ' @entity0 ' @entity0 has prompted outrage by apparently posting an @entity4 photo which mocked a man with a rare genetic condition			1
@entity7 , whose ectodermal dysplasia hinders his ability to grow teeth and hair , was dumbfounded when thousands of internet users imitated and mocked a selfie he took			1
they included @entity0 , who has now apparently deleted the @entity4 photo - which said ' @entity15 ' - and uploaded one comparing himself to the cartoon ogre @entity17			1
offensive : the photo was uploaded to the @entity4 account of @entity0 ( left ) comparing him to @entity7 ( right ) - who has the rare genetic disorder ectodermal dysplasia			1
it has since been deleted but the move was too late to stop a storm of comments from many of @entity0 's 500,000 followers on @entity4 and 8.3million on @entity29			2

' i was kinda hurt because i look up to him and i watch @entity0 play basketball so i was like , why is he making fun of me when he 's supposed to be this role model ? ' ' i ca n't let it get to me , then i get hurt and depressed , so i keep my mind positive			2
' the storm prompted the @entity75 for @entity76 to write an open letter to the @entity1 legend			1
executive director @entity79 said there were more than 180 forms of the condition and many left sufferers with missing teeth and unable to sweat			1
she wrote : ' you might want to consider making something positive come from this			0

' give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride			0
' self - mockery : the four time @entity1 champion has since uploaded a photo comparing himself to @entity17 so far @entity0 has not responded publicly to the row			1
some users rushed to the 7ft 1in four - time @entity1 champion 's support , saying people were too easily offended and @entity0 may not have known mr @entity7 had a disibility			1
anger : one @entity29 user 's response today the controversy comes after another top figure in the @entity1 , billionaire @entity35 owner @entity34 , made headlines when a tape of an alleged racist rant was leaked to @entity114			1
he is allegedly heard telling his girlfriend she can ' sleep with black people ' but not bring them to matches			0
' you can bring them in , you can do whatever you want , ' the voice on the tape says			0
' the little i ask you is not to promote it on that ... and not to bring them to my games			0
' it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you ’re associating with black people			0
do you have to ? ' i ’m just saying , in your lousy f * * * * * * * @entity133 , you do n’t have to have yourself with , walking with black people			0
' do n't put him ( @entity136 ) on an @entity4 for the world to have to see so they have to call me			0
and do n't bring him to my games			0
' in 2009 @entity34 agreed to a $ 2.76 million settlement over claims he discriminated against @entity142 and @entity143 tenants at apartments he owned			0
he did not admit any liability			0
campaign : @entity7 's anti-bullying @entity45 group @entity148 n't @entity147 has already gained 3,500 members response : one of the reactions which the @entity1 star received to the row from his 8.3million followers politics : another user highlighted the @entity1 star 's support for @entity161 ' @entity160 ' governor @entity159 abuse : some @entity29 users were more angry and one called @entity0 a ' sad pathetic excuse for a man '			1
others , however , defended him saying he may not have known @entity7 had a disability dear mr. @entity169 , all of us at the @entity75 for @entity76 ( @entity171 ) are terribly disappointed by the hurtful image that you and others recently posted on social media about a member of our family , @entity7 , who is affected by ectodermal dysplasia			1
individuals affected by these rare , genetic conditions often face a lifetime of bullying and negative remarks because of their appearance , which others may consider “ different			2
” bullying is never acceptable and we , as a nation , have had some devastating consequences as a result of bullying			0
however , to be called out on a celebrity ’s social media and made fun of is especially reprehensible			0
we applaud @entity7 for reacting to this cyberbullying by establishing a positive social media campaign called “ hug do n’t judge			1
” mr. @entity169 , we welcome this opportunity to enlighten you about the ectodermal dysplasias and how we could work together for positive change			2

of the more than 180 different syndromes , x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia ( @entity215 ) is the most common and features multiple malformed and missing teeth , the inability to perspire , sparse hair and recurring respiratory infections			1
symptoms can range from mild to severe , but in all cases present a variety of challenges			0
we invite you to attend our @entity225 , july 23 - 26 in @entity226 , @entity227 , and meet families from around the world who , like @entity7 , are affected by ectodermal dysplasias			1
you will meet some extraordinary people who are accomplishing profound acts despite the harsh social stigmas , daunting physical challenges , and financially draining dental procedures they ’re up against			0
you might want to consider making something positive come from this			0
consider giving @entity7 the gift of a smile , one that others would not make fun of			2
give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride			0
we are urging our @entity171 community to use this opportunity to raise awareness , to make positive change , and to support @entity7 ’s “ hug do n’t judge ” campaign ( # hugdontjudge )			1
we encourage you to do the same			0
let ’s raise awareness of the ectodermal dysplasias			2
