by @entity1 reporter published : 07:04 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 07:15 est , 30 november 2012 when @entity4 went from being an active toddler to one that could barely walk within the space of weeks , her mother knew that something was seriously wrong			1
@entity9 rushed her two - year - old to the doctor and after months of testing and treatment was shocked to be told her daughter had arthritis			1
usually associated with the elderly , @entity4 had developed a condition which would immediately change her life			1
@entity4 , pictured in her new school uniform left , never complains despite her chronic condition			1
she was diagnosed at the age of two ( pictured , right ) running , playing , dancing , even walking , would be impossible for the little girl unless doctors could find a treatment that would soothe the pain in her knees and hips			0
but @entity9 soon realised that @entity4 would have to spend years of her life going to and from hospitals and medical practices			2
@entity31 , 32 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , said : ' when i found out she had arthritis i was in complete shock			0
' i just started crying			0
i was worried that she ’d never be able to do the other things normal children do			0
' i thought why is it my child ? her life will revolve around going back and forth to the hospital			0
' at first @entity4 was given large quantities of liquid ibuprofen and cortisone shots to her knees and hips to help numb the pain			2
but when both only offered temporary relief , doctors realised her condition was more serious than first thought			0
they decided the best treatment would be chemotherapy drugs normally used for cancer patients			1
@entity4 was prescribed with methotrexate number of unpleasant side - effects , which include vomiting , hair - thinning , weakening of the nails , and a lowered immune system			1
for the first three hours of the day @entity4 ca n't bend her legs at all without her medication and has to be carried @entity4 swallows the medication in liquid form , but each time it causes her to be sick , upsets her stomach and leaves her mouth sore			2
because the medication lowers her immune system it also makes her susceptible to children ’s illnesses and her body weaker at fighting things like chicken pox			1
that is because @entity4 ’s juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is caused by an over-active immune system that attacks her joints , as well as protecting her from illnesses			1
around one in 10,000 children aged 16 or under suffer from chronic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , though it is much rarer among those aged two or under			1
there is no cure for the illness , but methotrexate works by stopping the immune system from attacking the joints			1
but the drawbacks of the medication lowering the immune system means children ’s illnesses like chicken pox and whooping cough could be deadly if @entity4 contracted them			1
doctors have to regularly blood - test @entity4 to make sure she does not have them and her school also has to warn her parents if any of them are going around			1
@entity9 said : ' doctors do n’t know how badly chicken pox might affect her , so she has to have blood tests			0
they ’re not nice for a child to have to go through			0
but the nurses do say she ’s very brave about it though			0
' @entity4 ( left ) enjoys dancing with her younger sister holly to @entity110 , her mother says @entity4 will soon start taking the chemotherapy drug by injection , because it makes it more effective			1
but rather than complain about the discomfort her medication causes , @entity4 is more concerned about making sure her youngster sister @entity117 , who is nearly two , is ok			2
' when you go through the things @entity4 has been through you have to grow up quickly in a lot of ways			2
but you wo n’t hear @entity4 complain			2
she ’s more worried about @entity117 and making sure she ’s ok			0
she ’s always looking out for her and they ’re always playing together , ' @entity9 said			0
other treatments @entity4 takes include large amounts of liquid ibuprofen for flare - ups of her arthritis and regular doses of folic acid			1
@entity4 also has to be carried up stairs by her mother because of the pain it causes , and needs to wrap up to avoid the cold , which worsens her condition			2
the ritual of medication - taking is a difficult one both for @entity4 and her mum , but @entity9 knows that without it her daughter would not be able to walk and do the things she loves			1
' for the first three hours of the day she ca n’t bend her legs at all without her medication and has to be carried			0
' she loves to dance			0
her and her little sister , @entity117 , love to dance to @entity110 , but without the treatment she could n’t dance at all			0
' for the next 10 years much of @entity4 ’s life will be spent travelling to and from hospital for treatment			2
it is not known whether she will suffer from the condition for the rest of her life or make a recovery , though the odds are in @entity4 ’s favour			0
there is no medical cure , but around 75 per cent of children are expected to recover from the illness before they are adults			0
@entity9 added : ' @entity4 always takes it in her stride			1
we have a few tears but she always been ever so good with it			0

@entity4 has chronic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , which affects one in 10,000 children aged 16 or under
she takes chemotherapy drugs as this stops the immune system from attacking the joints
however , they cause unpleasant side - effects including vomiting
