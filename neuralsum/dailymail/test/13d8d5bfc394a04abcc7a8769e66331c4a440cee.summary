if there 's someone who is n't scared to show her colourful side in these times of taupe and elephant breathe , it is celebrated interior designer @entity7			1
now the best - selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible , aptly named colour			1
' the ability of colour to transfrom surroundings , to excite , inspire , tantalise and calm , is second to none ! ' enthuses @entity7 , who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a ' squishy feeling of contentment ' everyday			1
@entity7 described the colours used by @entity22 in her @entity24 beachhouse as ' the most beautiful and complex i ’ve ever seen ' @entity7 says of this @entity27 home : ' inspired by a natural palette – silvery greys , driftwood taupes , watery greens and storm cloud greys – it ’s what you might call glammed - up neutrals			1
i adore ! ' the designer says : ' i assure you white hallways would n't have the same effect ! ' so her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige , stop procrastinating and be bold with colour			1
the inspirational photographs in the book , which @entity7 describes as displaying a ' virtuosic talent of colour ' , come from homes across the world			1
but if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task , in an extract from her new book , here are the designer 's top ten tips to colour confidence			1
' you do n’t have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level			1
layer on texture instead , ' says @entity7 of this look ' the soft gold kitchen cabinets in @entity70 ’s @entity69 pad ( opposite ) left me speechless			1
to master the metallic look , bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub , ' says @entity7 1			1
start by picking a colour for your biggest room – say your living room or kitchen			1
choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring , and true to what you love			0
build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home , using different combinations of those colours in each room			1
use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme			2
this could be a view from the window , a work of art or any favourite item you own			0
think about what you want from your home to communicate to the outside world			2
no one will be talking about your beige - on - beige home , so go a little crazy			2
be reckless , i say ! the more your confidence grows , the more you ’ll feel like experimenting with colour			2
be brave ! to start with , decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task			2
colour behaves differently according to where you put it			2
the effect changes again once you add lighting , pattern , texture and greenery into the mix. i think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group , as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. however , to me , this is a bit like decorating by numbers			2
too easy ! bold hues , on the other hand , make everything on display feel grander , cooler , more intense , with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight			0
you ’ll never look back ! left : ' subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo , ' says @entity7 of this black and white corner @entity7 advises , ' painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy , den - like and snug ' 5			1
remember , there are no no - nos. well almost none			0
pastels are one grouping i never want to work with			0
but then plop me in @entity27 and i ’m sure i ’d be instantly seduced ! 6			0
use colour in unexpected places behind closed doors , inside kitchen cupboards , bedroom wardrobes , the loo – all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter			0
introduce colour through cushions , vases , bowls , fruit , greenery – you name it			0
there should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on ! an inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven			0
the yellow warms up the darker hue , @entity7 says ' to avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull , adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour ' 8			1
all colour schemes are improved by accents : the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise , and bring rooms to life			0
there are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these ; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it			0
as fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow , it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger			0
patterns provide necessary punctuation ; do n’t neglect them			0
they anchor a space like nothing else i know			0
create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings			0
paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you ’ve made your space a zillion times bigger			0
promise ! ' clever finishing touches , like this whimsical wallpaper , revitalise rooms , ' she says the interior designer @entity7 ( left ) has written a new book about colourful style ethos ( right ) colour by @entity7 ( @entity235 , £ 20 )			1
