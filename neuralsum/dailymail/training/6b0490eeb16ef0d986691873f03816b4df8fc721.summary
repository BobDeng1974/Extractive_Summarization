by @entity0 homeless , abandoned and with a disabled child , this @entity2 mother saw no way out other than to wade into the river to kill herself and her baby			1
but the woman 's desperate actions were stopped when passers - by saw her walking in her clothes into the water , and formed a human chain to pull her and the baby back to shore in the city of @entity18 in central @entity2 ’s @entity20 province			1
and now , after the publicity the case attracted , mother @entity21 , 32 , has been given a place in sheltered accommodation and the promise that the local hospital will attempt once again to look at her baby daughter 's health issues			1
but after the baby was born she was told that not only was the child suffering from @entity51 's syndrome , but also that the baby had a congenital heart problem that meant it was unlikely to survive for long			1
she said : ‘ i visited many hospitals but no one could help me			0
then suddenly we found that my husband had packed his bags in the night and left without saying a word , and without any income we ended up homeless			2
’ unable to see a way out , she took the baby , not yet a year old , and carried it out into the river			2
now with the promise of a roof over their head and healthcare for her daughter , @entity21 says their future is looking much more promising			0
