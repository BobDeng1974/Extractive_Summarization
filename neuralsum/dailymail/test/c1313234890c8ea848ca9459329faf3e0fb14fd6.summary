when a man arrived at a hospital in @entity3 complaining of a stomach ache , doctors suspected it might be a run - of - the - mill case of food poisoning or an ulcer			2
however they were amazed to find the man had actually swallowed hundreds of coins and nails			2
over a three year period @entity11 , 34 , had swallowed 140 coins , 150 nails and a handful of nuts , bolts and batteries			1
he had also gulped down screws , nails and magnets			0
@entity11 , 34 , had hundreds of coins and other objects removed from his stomach after complaining of an ache			1
the image shows an x-ray with the mass of metal objects shown in white in his stomach doctors were amazed when an endoscopy ( a long thin tube with a camera attached ) revealed hundreds of foreign objects inside mr @entity11 's stomach			1
the endoscopy is pictured over a three year period , mr @entity11 had swallowed , 140 coins , 150 nails and nuts and bolts , batteries and magnets			1
some of the objects removed are pictured when doctors carried out an endoscopy – inserting a long , thin , tube with a camera attached to the end – it revealed the hundreds of foreign objects in his stomach			0
mr @entity11 , a farmer from @entity52 in @entity3 's western state of @entity54 , said his bizarre habit began after he fell into a depression , and eating metal objects brought him comfort			1
he said : ' i used to gulp down coins and metals with fruit juice or milk			0
' due to family problems i had slipped into depression and got hooked onto this weird habit			0
' doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and i would have eventually died			0
' i feel much more relaxed now			0
i am never going to do this again			0
' mr @entity11 claims he did n't realise his stomach pain was due to his habit of eating metal objects			1
doctors have carried out 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects , as well as a nine - hour operation			1
but mr @entity11 will still need another procedure to remove the rest of the metal pictured are x-rays of mr @entity11 's stomach , revealing the mass of foreign objects			1
mr @entity11 said : ' doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and i would have eventually died ' dr @entity89 ( pictured centre in blue ) led a team of five doctors who carried out the operation to remove the objects from mr @entity11 's abdomen he went to many medical centres in @entity54 complaining of a painful ache in his abdomen , but no doctors could diagnose the problem			2
finally , dr @entity103 , a gastroentologist at a local hospital , carried out an x-ray and revealed the mass of metal deep in mr @entity11 's stomach			2
he has since carried out more than 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects - yet some still remain			1
leading a team of five doctors , he also carried out a nine hour operation to remove more of the metal , yet mr @entity11 will still need another operation to remove the rest			2
dr @entity89 said : ' the patient came to us with severe stomach pain			0
when we did the endoscopy we were shocked to see so many foreign bodies , including coins and sharp objects in his stomach			2
' though we have managed to remove most of them , there are still sharp injects and coins in his stomach			0
' his body is too fragile to sustain another operation now so we plan to operate again in about seven days and remove the remaining objects			0
' mr @entity11 says he feels calmer now and will not swallow metal objects again			1
