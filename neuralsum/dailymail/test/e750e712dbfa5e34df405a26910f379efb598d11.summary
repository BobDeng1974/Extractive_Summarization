going down on one knee is always a nerve - wracking experience but popping the question in public comes with an extra helping of risk			0
and for one man , it was a risk that most certainly did n't pay off after he was very publicly turned down by his girlfriend during an appearance on the @entity11			1
in front of mr @entity31 and a tittering studio audience , a furious @entity14 then storms out , screeching : ' i 'm out of here ! ' the moment came towards the end of a stormy show in which the couple had hurled accusations at each other , with @entity13 admitting to having sex with one of @entity14 's friends while she took their pet dog for a walk			1
but following @entity14 's dramatic walkout , @entity13 , flanked by a furrow - browed mr @entity31 , insisted that it had all been a huge mistake			1
not impressed : she opens the box , takes a look at the ring and then throws it in his face heading off : @entity14 then storms off the stage , screeching : ' i 'm out of here ! ' ' it was one mistake , ' he explained			2
blaming his refusal to take the lie detector test on his ms , he continued : ' it was not my decision to not do the lie detector			0
the friend i had sex with was a one off			0
' but his pleas fell on deaf ears , with a sobbing @entity14 going on to reveal that she had also had a fling with someone else			2
' twice you went behind my back , ' shouted a furious @entity13			2
' i made one mistake			0
' having been advised to ' put up or move on ' by mr @entity31 , the couple left the show with no plans to marry in the near future			0
