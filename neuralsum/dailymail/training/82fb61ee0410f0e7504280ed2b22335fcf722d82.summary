camels are mentioned in @entity2 stories involving @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 as well as other famous characters			2
but archaeologists have found that the mammals were not domesticated in @entity9 until centuries after famous figures were said to have ridden them			2
they claim this shows that text in the @entity14 was compiled long after the events described in it and challenges the holy book as a historical document			1

an engraving from @entity14 showing @entity3 journeying into the @entity22 , by @entity23 , is pictured @entity25 37:25 ' then they sat down to eat a meal			0
and as they raised their eyes and looked , behold , a caravan of @entity30 was coming from @entity31 , with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh , on their way to bring them down to @entity38			0
' @entity25 24:10 ' then he loaded ten of @entity3 ’s camels with all kinds of expensive gifts from his master , and he traveled to distant @entity46			0
' @entity25 24:61 ' then @entity47 arose with her maids , and they mounted the camels and followed the man			0

' source : @entity53 camels were not domesticated in @entity9 until centuries after the age of the @entity57 – when @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity58 are said to have lived - between 2,000 and 1,500 bc. dr @entity59 and dr @entity60 of @entity63 's @entity62 and @entity64 used radiocarbon dating to pinpoint the moment when domesticated camels arrived in the southern @entity68			1
they found camels came in the 9th century @entity71 , not the 12th as previously thought			1
the findings , described in the journal @entity74 , draw more attention to the disagreements between @entity2 texts and verifiable history			0
‘ the introduction of the camel to our region was a very important economic and social development , ’ dr @entity59 said			0

a modern camel outside @entity96 is pictured by analysing archaeological evidence from the copper production sites of the @entity88 the archaeologists were able to estimate when the first domesticated camels arrived in the region from the @entity99 it is believed that camels were originally domesticated in the @entity99 for use as pack animals sometime towards the end of the second millennium @entity71 the oldest known domesticated camel bones were discovered in the @entity88 , in the @entity68 , which runs along the @entity9 - @entity108 border from the @entity109 to the @entity110 and come from a time when the valley was an ancient centre for copper production			1
dr @entity59 dated an @entity88 copper smelting camp where the domesticated camel bones were found in 2009 and discovered they dated to between the 11th and 9th century @entity71 he led another dig in the area in 2013 to determine exactly when domesticated camels appeared in the southern @entity68			1
together with dr @entity60 , he used radiocarbon dating and other techniques to analyse the findings of these digs as well as several others done in the valley			0
in all the digs , they found that camel bones were unearthed almost exclusively in archaeological layers dating from the last third of the 10th century @entity71 or later – centuries after the patriarchs lived and decades after the @entity135 , according to the @entity14			1
the few camel bones found in earlier archaeological layers probably belonged to wild camels , which archaeologists think were in the southern @entity68 from the @entity141 period or even earlier			1
the archaeologists claim their study shows that text in the @entity14 was compiled long after the events described in it and challenges the holy book as a historical document dr @entity59 and dr @entity60 think the @entity88 and would have been a logical entry point for domesticated camels into the southern @entity68 as it bordered the @entity99			1
they believe the first domesticated camels ever to leave the area may be buried in the @entity88			2
the arrival of domesticated camels promoted trade between @entity9 and exotic locations that were previously unreachable			2
camels can travel over much longer distances than the donkeys and mules that preceded them			0
by the seventh century @entity71 , trade routes like the @entity163 stretched all the way from @entity165 through @entity9 to @entity166			1
camels opened @entity9 up to the world beyond the vast deserts to profoundly alter its economic and social history , the researchers said .			0

archaeologists from the @entity63 , @entity9 , found that camels were not domesticated in @entity9 until the 9th century @entity71
they claim this shows that @entity2 text was compiled long after the events described in it and challenges the @entity14 as a historical document
researchers analysed the oldest known domesticated camel bones , found in the @entity88 in the southern @entity68 , to *inform* their research
