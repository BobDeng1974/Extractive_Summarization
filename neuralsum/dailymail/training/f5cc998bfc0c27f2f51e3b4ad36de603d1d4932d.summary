by @entity0 technology company @entity2 is in talks with the @entity4 system ahead of the @entity9 , it can be revealed			1
@entity2 , which already operates goal - line systems in football and video technology in australian rules football , believes it can significantly increase the speed of decision - making			1
it is also in talks with @entity18			2
the discussions come at a key time for the sport after @entity23 chief executive @entity22 labelled @entity8 ' a shambles ' following the @entity18 final - it took four minutes to award @entity27 's winning try and there were also two disallowed tries			1
controversy : the existing @entity8 system was criticised in deciding the @entity18 final the @entity4 is conducting a global trial of @entity8 which comes to an end in august			1
if @entity2 can convince the organisation that their system is worth the extra money then it would be in place for the @entity9 in @entity40			2
@entity2 , which was acquired by @entity41 two years ago , believes it can provide information for decisions within a few seconds by synchronising cameras from multiple angles			0
computer tracking will also provide information about whether the ball has crossed the line though it would still be able to video replays to judge whether the ball had been grounded			0
@entity52 , founder of @entity2 , confirmed that talks were in progress			2
he told @entity55 : ' our system is a much cleverer way of looking at incidents			0
in @entity61 rules , we have halved the average time for decisions to be made			0
' we are in conversation with @entity18 and the @entity4 and they are aware of our products			1
' we hope of course they will be there for next season and it would be great if we were there for the @entity9			0
' you can not be serious ! @entity2 has been successfully used at the @entity75 tennis championships the @entity4 would not confirm or deny whether talks with @entity2 were on - going			1
but an @entity4 spokesperson said : ' as with any global trial , the @entity8 is under a process of continual evaluation to promote clear , consistent and accurate decision - making while keeping game - time impact minimal			2
' the big issue is likely to be over cost , especially for @entity18 , as the @entity2 system would be more expensive that the current @entity8 system which just uses the existing tv feeds			1
the league is also adamant that the decisions made via the @entity8 at the final on saturday were proved to be correct			0
wait for it : the referee consults @entity8 during the @entity94 semi-final between @entity23 and @entity95 ' @entity96 became the first league in the world - at considerable cost - to introduce the @entity100 into every match , not just those that are televised live , ' said a @entity18 spokesman			1
' we are therefore committed to doing everything in our power - with other stakeholders , including the @entity4 and @entity109 ( @entity109 ) - to make sure we help the match officials get every decision right			0
' we are constantly looking at ways to improve the @entity8 process to help our match officials and although we have spoken to hawkeye we have no plans to use it at the moment .			0
