@entity63 visit site @entity65 at @entity66 visit site @entity69 & @entity68 at @entity70 visit site @entity72 at @entity73 visit site it 's only the second time the 31 - year - old has been spotted out since reports emerged that her dreams of a @entity80 television career have come crashing down			1
@entity81 of @entity83 's sister had been in talks to join @entity80 tv station @entity85 as a ' special correspondent ' , but negotiations for the £ 400,000 role disintegrated after she was deemed not to have a ' breezy ' enough manner			1
on friday the 31 - year - old stunned in ice - blue @entity92 gown at the @entity93 , her @entity95 tan and dazzling smile hiding what must be serious heartbreak at her latest career effort stalling			1
and locals in the south - west @entity13 borough seemed to be enjoying soaking up the view , too it 's only the second time the 31 - year - old has been spotted out since reports emerged that negotiations with @entity80 television network @entity85 have been cancelled the brunette chose a £ 475 tote bag by @entity17 , flat suede pumps and a leopard print scarf for her day out the @entity113 contributing editor and @entity114 magazine columnist , who was catapulted to fame following her sister 's wedding to prince @entity118 in 2011 , has long been keen to make a name for herself in the @entity80 but a source close to @entity85 says @entity0 ’s screen trial , which can be watched online , was a flop			1
in the clip the writer looked uncomfortable as she danced with an aged local in @entity125 , @entity126 , for no ascertainable reason			0
and came across as ‘ a bit grand , awkward and bored , rather than enthusiastic ’ , according to one insider			2
‘ cringe - worthy ’ said another			1
not that you would know it from her december 2014 column for the @entity134			0
excitedly describing her visit to @entity126 , @entity0 gushed about her experience of line - dancing and talked of the ' stunning ' mountain scenery			2
' @entity126 is real cowboy country , ' she continued			0
' everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big , non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards			0
' not one to claim the laurels undeserved , she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on @entity147			0
' it ’s easy to get carried away with the whole free - riding atmosphere			2
my dance partner was about 80 , and i did my best to keep up , ' she continued			0
' but it turns out i have two left feet , at least as far as moving to rhythm is concerned			0
on friday the 31 - year - old stunned in ice - blue @entity92 gown at the @entity93 , her @entity95 tan and dazzling smile hiding what must be serious heartbreak at her latest career effort stalling @entity0 even kept her glacial cool in that £ 750 @entity92 number when @entity163 laid siege to her on the red carpet , jostling for the celebrity glow of a joint photo - opportunity ultimately @entity85 , it is said , was keen not to repeat the expensive mistake it made a couple of years back with @entity170			1
they were concerned that by spending a lot of money on a famous - by - association personality with no apparent aptitude for tv presenting , they would look gullible when that person failed to produce ratings			2
friends of @entity0 say she did n’t want to move to the @entity80 anyway as it would be too far away from @entity182 , the 37 - year - old investment banker she ’s been dating since 2012 , who now lives in @entity184			1
and today she seemed to be keepng a low profile as she strolled around her favourite shopping haunt toting a £ 475 bag by @entity188 .			0
