her allegations of abuse have seen her diplomat employer arrested and triggered an international furor			1
but now , a leaked letter home , written by housekeeper @entity7 , reveals her to have given her family in @entity9 a very different account of her life in @entity12 to the one of ‘ virtual slavery ’ she has now alleged			1
the letter was posted by diplomat @entity16 ’s sister , @entity15 , on her @entity18 page as part of passionate defence of her sibling and rebuttal of the allegations leveled against @entity24 was written in december 2012 , just one month after her arrival in @entity12			1
' slave ' : @entity7 , with her husband @entity28 , who worked as a driver at the @entity30 in @entity31 , pictured in january 2010 - according to her mother in law she had always wanted to work abroad every day a smile : @entity7 's first impressions and description of her employer @entity16 , above , were positive as she embarked on her life in service in @entity12 mrs @entity16 does not say how she came to possess the text in which mrs @entity7 described the @entity16 family and dr @entity16 in particular as ‘ very nice			1
’ she wrote : ‘ this family is very nice			0
i ’m not feeling i ’m her servant			0
children call me “ @entity44 ” – that means elder brother ’s wife			0
‘ every day she has a smile			0
’ mrs @entity7 , 42 , who is originally from @entity52 , went onto claim that she received helped with her maid work allowing her ‘ spare time ’ and described the house into which the family were about to move : ‘ four bedroom , big sized and one big hall downstairs two rooms , upstairs two rooms			1
@entity16 pictured in june 2013 , just days before her housekeeper @entity7 went missing sparking a series of claims and counterclaims that would spiral out of control ‘ my room is separate			2
’ she explained that until the family moved in their new home on the @entity73 they were staying at the @entity74 and added : ‘ their window looks out at very nice buildings			0
’ she said that every day she prayed for her mother before going to sleep and promised to call and talk on @entity18 ‘ when master gives me a new sim			0
’ ' she ended the lett er , written in @entity82 , with the admission : ‘ i am trying to talk in @entity84 but i ca n’t – i forget			0
so bad : ) @entity7			2
’ attorney @entity85 , is representing @entity7 , she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row earlier her mother - in - law @entity89 , told the @entity90 , that @entity7 had ' always wanted to work abroad			1
' she said : ' i had reservations about the marriage but my son was in a hurry			0
' the couple courted for three years before marrying			0
@entity89 , claimed mrs @entity7 left the marital home after just three days - returning only when she learned she was pregnant			2
following the birth of a daughter the couple moved to @entity101 in southwest @entity31			0
mrs @entity7 has not responded directly to the letter			2
but attorney @entity85 , who is representing her though the non-profit victim assistance agency @entity103 last night spoke of her ‘ frustration and disappointment ’ that focus had slipped from ‘ crimes that were committed ’ to ‘ the criminal defendant			2
’ she pointed out that the case was about dr @entity16 allegedly lying to the federal government about the wages she was paying mrs @entity7			1
mrs @entity7 has claimed she as paid just $ 3.31 an hour , below minium wage			1
in a statement to the @entity116 mrs @entity85 said : ‘ dr @entity16 did not pay those wages , she grossly underpaid my client and required that my client work far more than she had expected			1
in the dock : an artist 's sketch of @entity16 at her arraignment in @entity121 in december protesters in the eastern @entity9 city of @entity124 , burn an effigy of @entity126 during the international fall - out of dr @entity16 's domestic dispute ‘ my client worked for her for quite a while and eventually she decided she could not tolerate the situation any longer			1
’ she refused to comment on her clients and her family ’s whereabouts			0
mrs @entity7 ’s husband @entity28 , and parents flew into @entity137 two days before police swooped on dr @entity16 and arresting her at the gates of her daughter ’s @entity73 school			1
since then the case has escalated to a state of international crisis			0
news that a female diplomat had been strip - searched and held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers before posting bail of $ 250,000 incensed the @entity9 government and public			1
@entity137 diplomats in @entity9 swiftly found many of their privileges rescinded and safety barriers removed from their embassy in @entity31			0
secretary of state @entity158 expressed his ‘ regret as well as his concern ’ over the incident in a telephone call to @entity9 national security advisor @entity164			2
he spoke of his hope that the ‘ close and vital relationship with @entity9 ’ remain unharmed			0
but nothing short of dropping the charges – one count of @entity170 one of false statement – against dr @entity16 seems likely to satisfy @entity9 authorities in the case which has now been raised in the nation ’s parliament			1
against this backdrop mrs @entity85 ’s statement continued : ‘ mrs @entity7 is not on trial here and we think that the message here has been lost in the fact that there are charges against @entity16 for violating @entity137 law and those charges relate to the underpayment of wages to a domestic worker			1
‘ that is the story that has been lost in the diplomatic row that has erupted between @entity137 and @entity9			2

@entity7 , 42 , from @entity52 was employed as housekeeper to diplomat @entity16 in *november* 2012
december 2012 letter allegedly written to her sister from @entity12 sees mrs @entity7 describe her employer as ' very nice '
says she felt ' not like a servant at all '
dr @entity16 was arrested last week on charges of visa fraud and amid claims she paid @entity206 just $ 3.31 an hour
@entity9 government outrage has escalated into an international incident
@entity206 's attorney , @entity85 , says the ' real story and crime ' has been lost in the *scandal*
