by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 22:00 est , 5 november 2012 @entity0 and her son @entity1 pictured in 1999 when i read @entity4 recently chose to have both her healthy breasts removed , it took me back to the decision i made 12 years ago to have the same operation			1
on the surface , everything in my life looked rosy			1
i was in my late 30s , working as a @entity11 in @entity12 and living with my husband , @entity13 , a printer , and raising our beloved son , @entity17 but inside i was a walking health time bomb			1
i was utterly convinced i was living on borrowed time , because my mother , grandmother and great - grandmother had all been diagnosed with cancer in their ovaries or breasts at the age of 52			1
each of them had died as a result			2
every time i looked at the little boy i had given birth to in 1995 , i shuddered to think i might not be here to see him grow up and become a father himself			1
as time passed , the advice my dear mother @entity39 had given to me soon after she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1989 began to dominate my thoughts			1
over and again , she had begged me to get my ovaries removed			2
a brave and indomitable woman , she lived for six years instead of the six months predicted by doctors at diagnosis			2
and , as she lay on her deathbed , her concern , as ever , was only for me			2
‘ @entity0 , ’ she pleaded			1
‘ please do n’t keep your ovaries			2
’ as she was the third generation to be diagnosed at exactly the age of 52 , she was convinced cancer ran in our family			1
in 1994 , two years before she died , as news about the @entity58 gene ( which gives a much increased cancer risk ) emerged , she and i went for tests with a geneticist			1
@entity62 knew any breakthroughs doctors found would not alter her own fate , but she hoped and prayed they would help me and , ultimately , save my life			2
we went to @entity67 , @entity12 , for a discussion about genetic testing			2
scientists were very close to identifying the gene but were not quite there yet			2
@entity0 pictured at home in 2002 mum gave samples of her blood to be used in the future — we all knew she would be dead by the time the gene had been pinpointed			1
ten months after her death on @entity80 , 1996 , i received a letter from the hospital saying @entity62 had tested positive for the @entity58 gene and that i could be tested if i so wished			2
they called me in april 1998 and i was tested for the first time			1
as i nervously faced the geneticist at @entity67 , he told me what i instinctively already knew — that at the age of 38 i had a 60 per cent chance of getting ovarian cancer and an 85 per cent chance of breast cancer			1
if you have the gene and the familial link , then you have an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer			1
@entity0 pictured on her web page my grandmother had breast cancer first and ovarian as a secondary			1
the latter is known as the silent killer , as it is usually too advanced before any major symptoms — such as a bloated stomach — are obvious			2
i did not have too many problems accepting that i needed to have a full hysterectomy			2
this disease had killed my mother and i was glad to get rid of the shadow of death which was hanging over me			1
the alternative of undergoing constant monitoring did not appeal to me at all			2
even though the odds on my getting breast cancer were higher , i chose to have my ovaries out in august 1998 , probably because it had killed so many women in my family			1
i felt incredibly relieved afterwards — as if i had guaranteed my future			0
but as my 40th birthday approached in march 2000 , i had to address the issue of a mastectomy			0
i ’d tried to shut my mind off from dealing with it — but i had no choice			0
even though doctors had never insisted i should have my breasts removed , the statistics spoke for themselves			0
keeping my breasts would be hugely high risk			0
it was like playing a lottery of life or death and the odds on surviving without an operation were just too slim			0
still , the prospect of having two healthy breasts amputated was utterly agonising			0
i had always taken care of my appearance , enjoying running and keeping fit			0
having my breasts removed seemed to equate with losing my femininity			0
it was hard to come to terms with the fact that while i looked so fit on the outside , i could have been carrying a killer on the inside , but i could n’t ignore the bleak statistics , my family history — or my young son then aged just five			0
i did not want him to grow up without a mum or see me suffer as i had my own mother			1
i wanted to see @entity1 grow up , and to enjoy his grandchildren			0
and i am sure @entity4 must have been thinking the same thoughts about her own family when she opted to have both her breasts removed			0
@entity0 and son @entity1 pictured in 1999 when he was aged just four i also wanted to live beyond my 50s — and owed it to my family to do it for them			1
in july 2000 , three months after my 40th birthday , i had the four - hour operation at @entity168 ’s @entity167			1
after the surgery , i immediately had implants fitted so i would n’t look too different			0
i told @entity1 that i was having the operation so that i would n’t get ill in the future			0
@entity0 pictured with her son @entity1 now @entity13 was with me as i was treated , but the whole trauma put immense pressure on our marriage and , a year to the date of my mastectomy , we split up			1
@entity13 , who is 12 years younger than me , had clearly been very scared and i do n’t think he had the maturity to deal with what was happening			0
i felt let down by @entity13 , which made it harder to recover			0
he did his best within his capabilities , but i felt rejected when he would n’t look at my new breasts			0
that was extremely difficult to deal with and knocked my confidence terribly , slowly , i began rebuilding my life and self - esteem			1
i have , over the years , had several relationships			0
one or two men were uncomfortable with my breasts , so i did n’t pursue the relationships			0
i am now totally confident showing my body because it makes me realise that i have defied death			0
as my 40s progressed , i made major changes to my life — swapping my office job to train as a hypnotherapist and inspirational speaker			0
at the age of 48 , i even started to run marathons			1
i am now 52 , the same age when my mother , grandmother and great - grandmother died or were diagnosed with cancer			1
i fleetingly think about that , but i focus on living			0
i hope by undergoing the radical surgeries , i have fulfilled my promises to my family — and it also means their deaths were not in vain			0
what a gift that is to me — and to @entity1 — who is now studying sports coaching at colleges			0
