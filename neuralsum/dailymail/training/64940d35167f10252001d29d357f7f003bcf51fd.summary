the @entity0 has given its initial approval for sweeping abortion restrictions late on friday , sending them to @entity4 governor @entity4 to sign into law after weeks of protests and rallies that drew thousands of people to the @entity9 and made the state the focus of the national abortion debate			1
republicans used their large majority in the @entity15 to pass the @entity16 nearly three weeks after a filibuster by @entity19 senator @entity18 and an outburst by abortion - rights activists in the @entity0 gallery disrupted a deadline vote on june 25			1
as protesters came to the @entity9 building in @entity31 on friday , bottles of urine and feces , and even tampons were confiscated by state troopers as they tried to prevent anything from disrupting the debate			1

the @entity0 's debate took place between a packed gallery of demonstrators , with anti-abortion activists wearing blue and abortion - rights supporters wearing orange			1
those attending the debate were searched , and any item that could potentially be thrown from the gallery , including tampons , were confiscated , according to the @entity71			1

the @entity0 's approval would send the bill to @entity4 governor @entity4 , who has said he will sign it			2
the circus - like atmosphere in the @entity126 marked the culmination of weeks of protests , the most dramatic of which came on june 25 in the final minutes of the last special legislative session , when a @entity19 filibuster and subsequent protest prevented the @entity16 from becoming law			2
@entity134 @entity16 would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals , allow abortions only in surgical centers , limit where and when women may take abortion - inducing pills , and ban abortions after 20 weeks			1

' there will be a lawsuit			2
i promise you , ' mr @entity196 said , raising his right hand as if taking an oath			2

mr @entity90 was determined to keep the vote on track			0

the debate has been simmering for months in @entity98			0
