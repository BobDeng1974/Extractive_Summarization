@entity0 was not convinced when his doctors told him that the best course of treatment for his early - stage prostate cancer was to do nothing			1
instead , the retired @entity7 engineer went to @entity8 to have the tumour destroyed by proton beam therapy , a cutting - edge intervention not available on the @entity12			1
@entity0 , 70 , a grandfather of three who lives with wife @entity14 , 67 , in @entity15 , @entity16 , was diagnosed last april			1
a routine blood test by his gp revealed his level of prostate - specific antigen ( @entity21 ) had risen			2
@entity0 , photographed at his home in @entity16 , went abroad for prostate cancer treatment @entity21 is produced by the prostate gland - raised levels can mean the gland has developed a cancerous growth			1
a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis and @entity0 was told by his hospital consultant that the cancer could be managed with ' active surveillance '			1
while this might sound like doing nothing , in fact it involves closely monitoring the tumour - usually with @entity21 tests and digital rectal examinations every three to six months , and repeat prostate biopsies every few years			2
if tests show the cancer is growing , doctors may give treatment such as surgery , radiotherapy or chemotherapy			2
' active surveillance ' is offered to men with less aggressive prostate cancer to avoid or put off unnecessary treatment that has potentially serious side - effects			2
the prostate is a chestnut - size gland that sits below the bladder and around the urethra			2
next to it are nerves and blood vessels that are essential for proper erectile and bladder function			0
pictured with his wife @entity14			0
he paid £ 16,000 for the procedure radiation can damage these nerves and blood vessels - half of prostate cancer patients given conventional radiotherapy were impotent after two years , according to a study published in the @entity70			1
about 4 per cent of men are left with serious urinary incontinence			0
surgery can also damage the nerves and blood vessels			0
@entity0 ' could not see the point of waiting for the condition to worsen ' but the alternatives did n't appeal , either			1
' they meant i faced a considerable risk of impotence and incontinence , ' he says			0
then last year he was visiting a friend in @entity8 when he saw a newspaper article about the @entity85 , which offers proton beam therapy			1
unlike conventional radiotherapy , which relies on high - intensity x-rays , this bombards tumours with protons , the hearts of atoms			0
the millimetre - accurate treatment is claimed to be less destructive to surrounding tissue and so less likely to cause side - effects			0
furthermore , the physical characteristics of protons mean they are not absorbed into the tissue they pass through , so they do n't damage it while killing the tumour			0
' the success rates were the same as conventional treatments offered in the @entity104 , ' says @entity0			1
' while there was no guarantee i 'd not suffer side - effects , the chances looked promising			0
' doctors in @entity8 said the operation would cost £ 16,000			1
had his cancer been at an advanced stage , it could have cost up to £ 29,000			1
@entity0 raided his life savings and had the procedure last june			1
after he had been given an mri and ct scan , surgeons inserted three small gold grains into his prostate to enable the beam to target the tumour safely			2
he lay in a body mould that held him absolutely straight , so his prostate did not move while the beam was targeted ; then he was wheeled into the radiation room			2
the procedure took only a minute and a half			0
' they sent the beam in from one side of my body , then the other , ' he remembers			2
' there was no pain or discomfort - i left the hospital within an hour of arriving			0
' this process was repeated four times , every second day			0
' my @entity12 consultant was initially concerned about what i 'd done , ' @entity0 says			1
' but the outcome has been brilliant			0
my @entity21 has dropped from 7 to 1.8 and i 'm living a normal life			0
' the @entity8 clinic claims it receives daily inquiries from @entity104 men about being treated for prostate cancer			1
so far , all the @entity104 patients it has treated have funded their care themselves			0
this month it was reported that @entity153 , a retired @entity104 banker who went to @entity8 for proton therapy , was planning to send his £ 17,000 bill to the @entity12 in the hope of taking advantage of a law that gives patients the right to be treated anywhere in the @entity162 ( if that treatment is considered appropriate )			1
but why is this treatment not available in the @entity104 ? all the @entity104 patients the @entity8 clinic has treated have funded their care themselves art of the problem is the cost of proton therapy technology - about £ 125 million per machine			1
but doctors here also say there is a lack of robust clinical evidence to prove its worth conclusively over conventional radiotherapy			0
last august , the government confirmed that £ 250 million would be made available to build two @entity104 proton therapy centres - one at the @entity177 in @entity178 , the other at @entity180 in @entity181			1
both are due to open in 2018			0
but @entity183 says the centres will not be treating men with prostate cancer			2
' they will be focusing their time and energy on childhood cancers and rare adult cancers , ' says @entity192 , the charity 's science information manager			0
@entity196 therapy has many benefits over conventional treatment for these cancers			2
rare adult cancers , such as those at the base of the skull or spine , can be hard to tackle without damaging surrounding nerves , and conventional radiotherapy can be particularly harmful for children , whose bodies and brains are still developing			0
the @entity12 sends 80 such patients a year abroad to have proton therapy , and treating them in the @entity104 should save money in the long term , says @entity192			1
but in prostate cancer , the evidence so far for proton therapy 's increased benefits is considered too marginal to justify the cost			1
the @entity85 claims the treatment dramatically cuts the risk of life - changing side - effects , such as impotence			0
' as far as we can tell , the incidence of impotence is about 30 per cent for people who have proton beam therapy , compared with about 60 per cent for conventional treatment , ' says @entity228 , the @entity104 representative for the centre			1
these results have not been independently verified			0
but the good news is that a @entity104 firm is developing new , cheaper proton - therapy equipment			1
@entity181 - based @entity234 is working with physicists at the @entity236 ( @entity236 ) , the scientists who developed the @entity238			0
it says its new machines will fit into one room rather than occupying a whole purpose - built facility			0
they cost around £ 26 million per machine , less than a quarter of the price of the two @entity246 is proposing to install proton beam therapy units in ten @entity104 hospitals and clinics in the next five years			1
@entity250 , professor of radiotherapy at the @entity252 and @entity253 , and a non-executive director of @entity234 , says : ' we should be cautious about the claims being made for proton therapy			1
' in the @entity259 , private care providers are making all sorts of spurious claims for it			0
' however , he is quietly hopeful			0
' any form of radiation therapy where you can be more accurate is potentially a beneficial advance			2
the @entity234 machine might enable us to get much cheaper proton treatment			2
' until then , patients such as @entity0 must choose between paying for proton therapy and having what 's available here .			1

@entity0 , 70 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , was told to do nothing about cancer
@entity279 paid £ 16,000 for proton beam therapy in @entity8 clinic
