' @entity13 hopes that her upcoming reality series will help her to change the way in which society views obesity - and enable other larger people to embrace their own body image			1
' obesity in @entity53 is such an issue that no one wants to talk about , and it ’s filled with so much shame that even my family and my friends , nobody said anything			0

' she added : ' i think that fat prejudice is one of the last socially acceptable prejudices that we have in @entity53 , and i think that ’s really a shame because if you want to pursue a life of happiness and health , you ca n’t do it when you hate yourself			0
