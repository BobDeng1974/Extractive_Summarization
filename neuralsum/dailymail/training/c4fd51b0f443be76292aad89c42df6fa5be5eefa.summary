‘ it was one of the worst performances since i came here , i did not recognise some of my players , ’ said the @entity8 , whose side responded to saturday ’s 1 - 0 defeat at home to @entity12 to stay within two points of leaders @entity15			1
‘ four days ago we played very well and lost			2
today , we played very badly and won			2

‘ if that ’s the worst they ’ve played then they must have played some pretty good stuff earlier in the season , ’ he said			0
@entity80 winger @entity25 – without a goal since october – fired what proved to be the winner on 34 minutes			1
it could have been a far more comprehensive success had @entity85 loanee @entity30 not spurned a series of opportunities which came his way			0
the first of those arrived when he ballooned over from @entity92 ’s delivery and he had the chance to make amends when @entity36 sprung him clear soon after			0
his low poke , however , was flipped over the crossbar by the instinctive arm of @entity27			0
but the @entity100 goalkeeper – making his first start for the @entity71 – was soon beaten			0
@entity38 was the inspiration with a pass which defined defence - splitting and @entity29 did the rest with a cool finish for his fourth of the season			0
@entity2 manager @entity0 labelled the win the ' worst ' display of their season thus far @entity30 , though , was left entering the break wondering just how he had n’t bagged a first - half hat - trick when he fired over from point - blank range in stoppage - time			1
the 21 - year - old did n’t fare much better after half - time and swept wide from 12 yards after good work by defender @entity118			1
@entity29 ’s earlier goal , however , ensured @entity30 ’s blushes were spared			0
man of the match @entity38 escapes the attention of two @entity28 players at the @entity124			1
