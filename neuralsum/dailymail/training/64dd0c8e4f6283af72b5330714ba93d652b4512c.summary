by @entity0 published : 18:47 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 18:47 est , 7 may 2013 scientists at @entity2 claim sunlight could lower blood pressure and help stop heart attacks and strokes @entity8 could lower blood pressure and help stop heart attacks and strokes , scientists claim			1
they argue the health benefits of the sun ’s rays outweigh the risks from skin cancer			1
@entity2 researchers found when skin is exposed to sunlight for just 20 minutes , blood vessels release an important chemical called nitric oxide			1
this acts to lower blood pressure , reducing the risk of heart attacks , strokes or blood clots			1
dr @entity28 , a senior lecturer in dermatology , pointed out that strokes and heart attacks cause many times more deaths than skin cancer			1
around 159,000 @entity34 a year die from the circulatory illnesses , while skin cancer kills 2,750			2
his team monitored the blood pressure of 24 volunteers who sat under tanning lamps for two sessions of 20 minutes each			2
in the first session volunteers were exposed to both uv rays and heat			0
but for the second session researchers blocked the uv rays , exposing them to heat alone			0
the volunteers ’ blood pressure dropped significantly after the first session , but not the second			2
this implies it is uv radiation , not heat , which is responsible for the beneficial effects			0
the researchers believe sunlight unlocks nitric oxide stored in skin and widens arteries			0
both effects lower blood pressure			2
dr @entity28 will present his findings on friday at the @entity65 conference in @entity66			0
he said : ‘ we suspect the benefits to heart health of sunlight will outweigh the risk of skin cancer			1
’ he said scientists have known for years peoples ’ blood pressure is lower in summer than winter			1
additionally , research shows populations of countries far from the equator , with less sunlight , have higher blood pressure			0
dr @entity28 said it was not a ‘ cure ’ and it was ‘ too early to say ’ if people should go in the sun more			0
while the preliminary research involved only a few people , it will fuel the debate over whether sun exposure is good or bad			0
the scientists argue the health benefits of the sun 's rays outweigh the risks from skin cancer			1

scientists argue health benefits of sun outweigh risks from skin cancer
@entity2 researchers found exposure can *cut* blood pressure
scientists point out strokes and heart attacks kill more than skin cancer
