her husband , however , begs to differ			0
the @entity7 on wednesday joked about @entity2 's hair being a ' nightmare ' during a private visit to the homeless charity @entity11			1
in light of @entity15 's comment , @entity12 takes a look back on the former miss @entity18 's ever - changing hairstyle			1
from her unkempt tresses in her university days to the sophisticated style she wears so well today , the 32 - year - old has made the transition from long - haired student to glamorous future queen with aplomb			1

through the years , however , she has adopted a much more polished look			0

speaking about the royal 's changing hairstyle , @entity56 , @entity57 of the @entity58 , said : ' @entity59 of @entity7 knows what works for her and has continued to keep her locks looking luscious and volumised over the years			1
' her look has n’t changed dramatically , however , the condition of her hair has gone strength to strength with it looking more shiny than ever , especially during her first pregnancy			2
' she has the best of both worlds whereby she can leave it down on a day - to - day basis			0
alternatively , she can opt for an up - do for the more formal parties with a thick , fuller finish to compliment her overall look			0
it would be great to see her experiment with a bit of colour , perhaps some highlights to lighten her existing shade - something new for @entity81			0
' indeed , in recent months , the royal , who has often been criticised for her unadventurous style , has been trialling new looks			2
perhaps in keeping with the current trend for up - dos , the @entity2 has been sporting sophisticated chignon hairstyles , sometimes leaving the hair sleek and sometimes curling the ends into a low bun			1
' the more formal look is a good thing with long hair as it is nice to do something different without having to cut it , especially when you have different engagements to attend as many women do this time of year , ' said @entity100 , salon manager / technical director at @entity101 , @entity102			2
new styles : @entity2 likes to leave her hair down on a day - to - day basis but has been opting for more up - dos at recent formal events signature style : @entity2 has made glossy , bouncy , curled locks her signature and no matter how breezy it is outside , her perfectly coiffed hair always survives the elements , making it one of the most envied heads of hair in the world thick and full : want hair as thick as @entity2 's ? products like @entity119 is a great product to penetrate the hair making it more manageable , free - flowing and full , say experts hair through the ages : @entity2 showed off some grey strands on an outing in november last year , left , but paid a visit to the salon to ensure her locks were back to their glossy best how does she do it ? even when she walked out of hospital straight after giving birth to @entity133 in july last year , the @entity2 of @entity7 's hair looked at its best shaking things up : @entity2 wore a natural style on royal tour in september 2012 , left , a pretty pearl embellished bun style in the same month , centre , and even tried out bangs in december that year , right even @entity2 suffers from a bad hair day : her hair survives the elements most of the times but proving that she 's just like us , even the perfectly polished @entity2 suffers the occasional windswept moment get the look : celebrity hairdresser @entity148 , who has worked with @entity2 , pictured in ( l - r ) 2012 , 2011 and 2012 , said : ' long hair is often in need of more attention			1
maintenance is key - regular trims are essential to help prevent split ends and keep it healthy			0
it ’s also important to use the right products ; nourishing shampoos , conditioners and masques will help keep long hair feeling great and looking healthy ' oh how things have changed ! in her student days back in 2005 , @entity2 's hair was a far cry from the glossy locks we know and love today so how does @entity2 keep those locks so glossy and how can mere mortals replicate the look at home ? ' the secret to caring for long hair like hers is ensuring you are using the right on your hair , explained @entity56			1
' products like @entity119 is a great product to penetrate the hair making it more manageable , free - flowing and full			2
it also thickens existing hair at the roots			2
it is also important to not expose the hair to too much heat , so letting it naturally dry and then blow - drying the ends or the roots to create volume or polishing up your natural finish			2
' celebrity hairdresser @entity148 , who has previously worked with @entity2 , added : ' long hair is often in need of more attention			1
maintenance is key to caring for it - regular trims are essential to help prevent split ends and keep it healthy			0
it ’s also important to use the right products ; nourishing shampoos , conditioners and masques will help keep long hair feeling great and looking healthier in appearance			2
' and , say experts , @entity2 may have her pregnancy to thank			1
' hormonal changes can make hair revert into one of three of its cyclical stages of hair growth ; amongst other changes , pregnancy can make hair thicken and become more abundant in density , ' explained @entity148			0
' you may find also find changes in texture , appearance and even shape			0
' however , life has n't always been so glossy for the groomed royal			0
like any woman , @entity2 has n't been without the odd bad hair day			1
@entity2 was photographed with streaks of grey in her usually immaculate tresses in november last year			2
like any woman would , she decided it was high time to invest in some serious post-pregnancy styling			0
she booked an emergency appointment at the most expensive hairdresser in the country , then spent a marathon six hours being coiffed , coloured and blow - dried to ensure she was restored to her status as yummy mummy in chief			0
according to @entity245 , @entity2 spent more than half a day at the luxurious @entity247 hair spa in central @entity102 where a haircut with @entity249 - born mr @entity247 costs £ 600			1
given the newly lustrous appearance of @entity2 ’s locks , it most certainly worked			1
iconic : @entity2 's hair is among the most envied by women across the globe - and , say , experts , it 's all about giving her hair the right foundation : the best nourishing treatments on the market ' to recreate the iconic classic duchess of @entity7 hair look i would recommend you begin with a good hair foundation and by this i mean a good shampoo and conditioner			1
i would recommend the @entity269 , it is great to quench the thirst of moisture in your hair , leaving it silky and full of body			0
a good conditioner would be @entity276 as it effectively helps to repair and strengthen hair due to its formulation			0
to create the sleek , glossy , free - flowing hair that the @entity2 is known for , i would finish the look with the @entity281 as it is enriched with a blend of three precious and luxurious oils ( @entity284 , @entity285 ) , leaving your hair up to 10 times smoother with triple the amount of @entity287 ' for a bouncy blow dry , prep is key - spritz a setting spray like @entity291 tecni.art @entity292 through damp hair for grip and hold , and a root - boosting spray like the @entity296 for weightless volume			1
medium - size heated rollers are ideal for creating body and bounce ; finish the look with a hairspray like the @entity304 for invisible , flexible hold ' , @entity148 ' it 's good to use an oil like @entity281 for a lovely healthy shine and gloss and a volumising spray directly onto the roots , like the @entity312 for extra body and bounce			0
blowdry with a large round brush also using something like a @entity318 roller to set the curls while finishing the blowdry			0
after taking out the rollers use a light brush - able humidity resistant spray such as the @entity324 which is perfect to finish with as the hair will have hold while still being able to move , ' @entity100			0
