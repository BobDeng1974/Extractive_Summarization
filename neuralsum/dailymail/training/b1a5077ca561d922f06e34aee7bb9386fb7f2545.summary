@entity0 and @entity1 are offering women employees the chance to put their dreams of motherhood on ice – by paying for them to freeze their eggs			1
the extraordinary perk is aimed at boosting the number of women staff by allowing them to focus on their careers without sacrificing the opportunity to have children later in life			0
the @entity17 giants – the first major employers to offer the procedure for non-medical reasons – are willing to pay £ 12,500 a time to cover the cost of putting the eggs on ice plus an additional £ 300 - a - year for deep freeze storage			1
according to @entity31 , @entity0 has begun paying for egg freezing and @entity1 will start in january			1
preserving eggs has been described as a key to ‘ levelling the playing field ’ in the male - dominated tech industry and a possible game - changer for women who have traditionally had to choose between their careers and starting a family at a time when their male counterparts are climbing the ladder			1
‘ having a high - powered career and children is still a very hard thing to do , ’ @entity44 , an egg - freezing advocate and founder of the patient forum @entity48 , told @entity31			1
‘ by offering this benefit , companies are investing in women and supporting them in carving out the lives they want , ’ she added			1
paying for the procedure can be seen as rewarding women employees for their commitment , said @entity60 specialist @entity59			2
women who know they want children someday ‘ can go on with their lives and know that they ’ve done everything that they can ’			0
in the past year , fertility doctors in @entity68 and @entity60 report that egg freezing cases have nearly doubled			2
in a 2013 survey published in the journal @entity70 and @entity71 , a majority of patients who had their eggs frozen reported feeling ‘ empowered			0
’ bank : the eggs will be put in deep freeze so women can continue their careers , the technology giants said the fact that two of @entity17 ’s biggest companies are introducing the initiative is no coincidence			1
tech giants are fighting for talented staff in what has become known as the ‘ perk arms race ’			0
@entity0 ’s chief operating officer @entity91 , in particular , is known for her pro-women stance			2
the social media firm gives new parents £ 3,000 in so - called ‘ baby cash ’ to spend however they like			2
both firms also offer generous wellness - orientated benefits to staff			0
critics say the move is simply a ploy to persuade women to stay with the company			0
last night an @entity1 source indicated the company had no plans to extend the policy to the firm ’s @entity109 workforce			0
an @entity1 spokesman in the @entity112 said : ‘ we want to empower women at @entity1 to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families			1
’ however @entity118 academic @entity117 , asked : ‘ would potential female associates [ staff ] welcome this option knowing that they can work hard early on and still reproduce , if they so desire , later on ? ' or would they take this as a signal that the firm thinks that working there as an associate and pregnancy are incompatible ? ’			0
