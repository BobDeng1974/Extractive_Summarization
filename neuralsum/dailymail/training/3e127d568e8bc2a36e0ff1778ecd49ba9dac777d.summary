@entity0 says her dad ' would be dead if it was n’t for the first aid he was given ' so many details surrounding golfer @entity6 ’s sudden cardiac arrest in august last year remain a mystery			1
prior to the attack , he had not suffered any symptoms or ill health			1
and , although the cause – an ‘ electrical fault ’ – has now been determined , doctors still can not be sure why his heart stopped beating that day			1
but there is one thing on which doctors do agree : @entity6 is extremely lucky to be alive			1
the 65 - year - old , who played in eight @entity20 and captained @entity21 three times in the competition , mercifully remembers nothing of the event			1
as he stood up to give a speech after dinner at the @entity30 in @entity31 , he ‘ just fell over , as if a boxer had landed a punch ’			0
at first ‘ people in the audience thought it was part of my act ’ , @entity6 has recalled since , jokingly			1
his next memory came more than a week later in intensive care , with his distraught wife @entity39 , and children @entity41 , @entity42 and television presenter @entity0 , at his bedside			1
so , yes , many unknowns			0
yet there is one certainty : were it not for the swift intervention of those in the audience who knew first aid , @entity6 would not have survived			1
while acknowledging their incredible good fortune , @entity51 star @entity0 , 38 , still finds it hard to recount the dreadful days watching over her perilously ill father			1
and so , as she opens the nominations for the fourth @entity58 awards , she has issued an impassioned plea : ‘ my dad would be dead if it was n’t for the first aid he was given			1
these are skills anyone can learn – and everyone should			0
‘ i have , as luckily @entity51 offers courses			0
in fact , i ’ve done the course twice			0
it ’s not just cardiac arrests or heart attacks but everyday things such as cuts , burns or choking			1
‘ the fact is , if you do n’t know what to do in a situation like that – whether it ’s a family member in need or a stranger in the street – you ’re helpless , and all you can do is stand by , watch and do nothing			2
imagine how you ’d feel if someone died when you could have helped save them			0
’ among the audience at the @entity30 that day was @entity87 , who by coincidence trains oil - rig workers in how to use defibrillators			0
these machines deliver a short electric shock via adhesive pads placed on the chest to restart the heart in the event of a cardiac arrest			1
a nurse – again , at the event by coincidence – performed chest compressions and mouth - to - mouth , while mr @entity87 , 44 , rushed to the hotel gym to retrieve the defibrillator , which is also known as an @entity106			0
together the pair kept his heart going for more than 20 minutes before paramedics arrived and took over			2
@entity6 ’s heart stopped three times – and each time the @entity106 brought him back to life			1
earlier this month , @entity6 was able to meet his saviour and shake him by the hand			1
‘ what do you say to the guy who saves your life ? ’ he has said			0
‘ thanks very much , for a start			0
’ ' we all feared the worst ' : @entity0 and her father @entity6 , who suffered sudden cardiac arrest in august last year in partnership with @entity126 , the @entity58 awards recognise inspirational individuals who have helped save lives through first aid			1
from today , you can nominate in a number of different categories , and the winners will be announced at a star - studded ceremony at the @entity136 hotel , hosted by @entity0 on july 1 , 2015			1
@entity58 chief executive @entity137 says : ‘ too many people die in situations where first aid could have given them a chance to live			2
@entity58 gives us a chance to recognise the people who step in when others do n’t , or ca n’t , act			2
‘ not only do they have the first aid knowledge but they have shown the courage to help someone who needs them			2
’ @entity0 remembers the awful moment she discovered her father ’s life was hanging in the balance			1
‘ my mum was in @entity156 at the time , so i was the first to get the call , ’ she explains			0
‘ it was about 11pm on a thursday , and i ’d just sat down to watch the @entity159 when my agent rang with the news that @entity162 was in intensive care			0
it was just the most horrendous moment			0
’ @entity0 , @entity41 and @entity42 booked flights to @entity31 , where their father was in hospital , and arrived there early the next morning			1
‘ i ’d called my mum straight away , and she ’d spoken to the consultants			0
they ’d told us all the usual things – that they were doing everything they could , that he was in the best place he could be – but nothing stops you thinking the worst			0
when i saw him there , my strong , fit dad , covered in tubes and surrounded by machines – nothing can prepare you for that			2
we thought we were going to lose him			0
’ it was particularly shocking for the @entity185 , who take pride in their healthy lifestyles			0
@entity0 says : ‘ @entity162 swam every day and eats really well – he was never overweight , really			1
my mum is a dietician so makes sure of that			0
in fact , before the attack he was probably fitter than he ’d ever been in his life			2
we were all brought up to respect our health and bodies			2
’ she is quick to point out the difference between a cardiac arrest and a heart attack : the latter is usually the result of blockages in the blood vessels around the heart , often the result of poor diet and lifestyle leading to fatty deposits inside them			1
the lack of blood leads to part of the heart muscle dying , sometimes causing extreme pain – hence the attack			1
a cardiac arrest , however , is when the heart simply stops beating			1
‘ it can happen to anyone , ’ @entity0 adds			1
@entity218 retired from football on medical advice , following a cardiac arrest he suffered during an @entity223 tie in march 2012 footballer @entity218 survived a cardiac arrest during a match in 2012 thanks to a similar combination of cpr and aed shocks			1
if defibrillation is delivered promptly – within two to three minutes of collapse – survival rates as high as 75 per cent have been reported			0
it was this that undoubtedly saved @entity6 , who , after a week intensive care , started to pull through			1
@entity0 says : ‘ they took him out of the induced coma that they put him in to stop his organs from shutting down , and that was the sink - or - swim moment			1
my sister and i went back to the hotel where we were staying nearby , but we did n’t sleep a wink			2
‘ at about 5am , @entity246 called to tell us @entity162 was responding			0
after all the pain , it was the first glimmer of hope we ’d had			0
i believe if he had n’t been in such good health beforehand , he ’d not have fought back like he did			1
’ @entity6 was allowed home after a fortnight in hospital , and his recovery has been relatively rapid			1
‘ he was told he ’d never play golf or swim again , but he ’s doing all those things now and he seems fine , ’ says @entity0			1
the golf star has , like @entity218 , been fitted with an implantable defibrillator – a tiny device that delivers a lifesaving electric shock to the heart if it stops again			1
and in @entity6 ’s case it has done – twice			2
‘ the first time it happened , he only told us in passing that he ’d fallen off his chair a few days before			0
of course we were furious , ’ reveals @entity0			2
‘ but thankfully he was ok			0
the second time , last november , i was at their house talking to mum when we heard this almighty crash			0
we rushed in to find him on the floor , grey and ashen but conscious			0
‘ the ambulance came straight away and he recovered well			0
they adjusted his medication , and there have n’t been any incidents since			2
’ @entity0 , recently separated from her rugby star husband @entity278 , with whom she has sons @entity280 , seven , and four - year - old @entity281 , has since joined her parents in campaigning for the £ 1,000 defibrillators to be installed at all golf clubs			1
according to a recent @entity58 survey , an astonishing nine in ten people do n’t know what an aed is			2
and of those who do , almost two - thirds do n’t feel they would know how to use one should they witness someone having a cardiac arrest			1
‘ these new digital machines are foolproof , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ you open the box and a recorded voice tells you exactly what to do			2
you ca n’t do anyone any harm with one either , as they read and analyse the heart ’s electrical system and will only give a shock if the heart has stopped			1
it ’s so important people know that			0
‘ the last thing you want to do is realise , in hindsight , that you could have helped , but did n’t			0
’ it 's time to nominate your hero do you know someone who has saved a life by using first aid ? @entity58 ’s annual @entity58 awards recognise the inspirational individuals who do just that – and nominations are now open			2
there are nine categories , recognising both individuals and organisations who support training , and the winners will be honoured at a ceremony at the @entity136 hotel on july 1 next year , hosted by @entity0			1
the shortlist for the @entity327 will be featured in these pages and @entity126 readers can vote for the winner			0
@entity137 , chief executive at @entity58 , says : ‘ we ’re on the lookout for ordinary people who have done extraordinary things by putting first aid into practice when it matters most , or by helping more people learn this vital skill			0
everyone has the ability to save a life and we want to celebrate those who are doing just that			0
‘ thanks to the first aid knowledge and heroic actions of some incredible individuals , people are alive today who otherwise would n’t be			2
we believe these achievements should be recognised			0
’ make your nomination at sja.org.uk / everydayheroes			0
closing date : february 28 , 2015 .			0
