it was a completely different organisation from what it became when @entity16 , @entity14 , and @entity15 joined , who seemed to be ashamed of it , pulling their photographs and so on			1
’ this comment appears to be a reference to attempts by the @entity5 ’s official photographers , @entity33 and @entity34 , to prevent newspapers from publishing the picture featured here			0
