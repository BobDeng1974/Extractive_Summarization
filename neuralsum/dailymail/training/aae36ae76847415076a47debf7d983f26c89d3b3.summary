by @entity0 published : 20:01 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 25 july 2013 over the years his property portfolio has grown every bit as impressively as his fortune			1
but @entity5 has not always enjoyed success with the buying and selling of his many homes			1
until now , for i learn that he and his wife @entity10 have scooped £ 170,000 on a recent sale			1
the bonanza profit — more than the @entity14 average price for a whole house — was made in just four years on a home in @entity17 they bought for their son @entity19 in 2009			1
bonanza profit : @entity5 and his wife @entity10 made £ 170,00 on the sale of a house they owned for just four years they paid £ 1.13 million to purchase the four - bedroom @entity27 townhouse for cash , and have sold it for £ 1.3 million to a former @entity32 politician and would - be @entity34 mp			1
the new owner , dr @entity35 , who has @entity14 and @entity32 citizenship , says he was selected by the conservatives as a potential parliamentary candidate			1
instead , he stood for election in @entity32			1
dr @entity35 , 59 , already owned the house next door to @entity19 , from where he runs a medical clinic			1
he says @entity10 had initially tried to buy his house from him			1
‘ i bought my house in 2009 , the same time as the @entity47 , ’ he says			1
‘ mrs @entity48 contacted me and asked if we wanted to sell our house			1
i think she wanted it for her daughter			1
but i did not want to sell			1
‘ then , a few years later , i made an offer to the @entity47 they found difficult to turn down , and we bought their house			1
’ dr @entity35 says being a neighbour of @entity19 had been an eye - opening experience for him			1
‘ it has been shocking to see children of @entity5 doing their own shopping at @entity61 , and cycling around like ordinary children			2
we would never see children of ministers in @entity32 mixing with anyone other than their own class			2
’ he adds : ‘ the @entity47 have been very good neighbours , always courteous			1
the @entity5 children were very down to earth , very polite			2
’ @entity19 , 27 , moved out last month to a larger property nearby , which the @entity72 bought for him for £ 1.35 million in cash			1
the @entity47 still maintain a portfolio of eight properties worth an estimated £ 21 million			1
their two other elder children , @entity77 , 29 , and @entity78 , 25 , also have their own houses			2

' i ca n't believe i 'm still working ' : @entity88 , 72 once the highest paid cabaret artist in the world , @entity88 lost everything in a @entity93 banking fraud — but now at the age of 72 she has become a workaholic as she battles to regain fame and fortune			2
‘ i ca n’t believe i ’m still working , but now i ’ve got two jobs , ’ @entity88 reveals at the opening night of @entity99 ! the musical , at the @entity102			2
‘ i ’m touring the country in a murder has been arranged and also rehearsing for my new one - woman show , ’ she adds			2
‘ it ’s tough going at my age — i had thought i might be retired by now			2
’ a former carry on star , convent - educated @entity88 has been married to artist @entity109 for almost 40 years			2
in 1985 , they lost millions after , she claims , a bank embezzled their savings			2
her woes were compounded by the loss of their £ 1 million @entity115 home and personal tragedy — both she and @entity109 have suffered cancer			1
‘ but being a workaholic is saving me , ’ beams @entity88			2
‘ i look on the bright side			0
’ in 2008 , @entity122 was snowboarding in the @entity123 when an avalanche swept him over the side of a mountain , dumping him on his back 200ft below			0
he was paralysed from the waist down and told , at the age of 27 , he would never walk again			0
but @entity122 has astonished doctors and now gets around , largely under his own steam , on sticks and with leg braces			0
and next month he will take on a remarkable physical challenge			0
over two weeks @entity122 , son of stockbroker and racing figure @entity138 , will swim two - and - a - half miles , cycle 112 miles , walk 26 miles and then , uniquely , climb the face of the very cliff from which he fell			1
it is called the @entity143 and has inspired a host of celebrity figures from @entity146 to sir @entity147 to back him			0
@entity122 , a member of @entity149 ’s wheelchair tennis team , tells me : ‘ i want to do a challenge for charity and going back to the scene of my accident seems very appropriate			0
’ he hopes to raise £ 350,000 for @entity155			1

‘ do n’t tell her yet but my secret plan is to ask @entity157 to marry me under the @entity174 , ’ @entity157 ’s beau , handsome gentleman farmer @entity160 , 25 , tells me			0

’ █ @entity211 ’s triumph at @entity212 has had an unexpected spin - off — equality for women			0
councillors in @entity217 have decided to give @entity211 the @entity218 of the @entity220 borough where the championships are held , but realised , to their horror , that they had n’t done the same for three other @entity14 who have won the singles — all of them women			0
so , after quite a wait , the freedom of @entity217 is also being granted to @entity228 ( who won in 1961 ) , @entity229 ( 1969 ) , and @entity230 ( 1977 )			0
@entity233 the excitement of the royal baby has not escaped prince @entity235 ’s goddaughter @entity234 in the @entity236			0
she is thrilled that @entity237 and @entity238 chose @entity239 , her grandfather @entity241 ’s name			0
