a father bidding to be a @entity2 mp has been barred from taking his children to its meetings by a judge who warned they were at risk of ‘ emotional damage ’			1
at a custody hearing held behind closed doors , she told the candidate many people do not like the party , leaving the youngsters at risk of witnessing hostility from opponents			1
the judge told the family court hearing in the @entity21 that her fears included the possibility of somebody throwing something at the youngsters			1
the father , who can not be identified , said he was asked if he would undertake not to take his children to party events			1
after he refused , he said the judge made an order to stop them being involved in any political activity			2
the father ( pictured ) , who can not be named , has been barred from taking his children to @entity2 meetings last night , the dad said he felt ‘ stigmatised ’ and claimed the judge had been ‘ blinded by prejudice ’ towards his party			1
‘ i feel deeply insulted , ’ he said			0
‘ i have been treated like a criminal			0
a parent should be allowed to bring up their child using common sense and not have that interfered with by a judge			2
‘ i was astonished during the discussion about my children ’s holidays when the judge became animated on hearing they had attended @entity2 meetings			1
‘ the judge made several remarks that i regarded as @entity52 and asked if i would undertake not to take them again			2
she claimed the children were at risk of “ emotional damage ” if they attended @entity2 events			1
‘ she went on to pass an order banning me from taking them on political activities			2
’ the candidate said the judge told him there are a lot of people with very strong feelings about @entity2 including many who are ‘ dead against ’ the party			1
‘ she told me my children could be exposed to hostile reactions that could cause emotional harm , ’ he added			1
‘ this is not based on any law , but a judge ’s politically correct view			2
all political parties have gatherings , they all do street stalls , have public events , a lot of children go on marches with protesters			2
two years ago , a couple in @entity88 had their three much - loved @entity90 foster children taken away on the grounds their membership of @entity2 meant they supported ‘ racist ’ policies ‘ there are hundreds of politicians and party members up and down the country taking children to political events all the time			1
i can not see why i have been singled out			0
’ the father said the order ‘ seems to be motivated by the judge ’s distinct prejudices against @entity2 and perceiving it as a hazard ’			1
he added : ‘ the judge seemed to think people are very angry about @entity2 as if there ’s something wrong with it			1
i find that very belittling			0
we ’re a mainstream political party			0
‘ millions of people support @entity2			1
how can she imply that these people are on an extreme fringe and that i am taking children into a dangerous situation ? it ’s absurd			1
‘ i see this as an attack on normal family life and on @entity2			1
i know i have not done anything wrong but am being treated with contempt			0
‘ it is interfering with how i bring up my children			0
parents should be left alone to bring up their family according to common sense			0
‘ we are told what to do , what to think and how to run our lives			0
’ today at an appeal hearing the father will argue that hostile behaviour and foul language are more likely to be experienced at football games than during campaigning			1
he will challenge the order on the grounds that it interferes with his right to family life by unnecessarily impeding how he chooses to bring up his children day - to - day			2
the father said his youngsters had attended party events like rallies and joined him as he took part in campaigning such as leafleting			2
but he insisted he would never take them to anything where he thought they were at any risk			0
‘ i ’m careful with my children , what they eat and where they go			0
i ’m a good parent , ’ he said			0
‘ my children are wonderful and adorable and i ’m always mindful of them			0
there has been no incident where i showed a lack of common sense			0
i would never take my children to anything hazardous or pressurised where they would feel uncomfortable			0
if you are out with your children , you are always vigilant			0
