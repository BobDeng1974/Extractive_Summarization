by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 05:57 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 01:59 est , 30 september 2013 she is the first to admit her last novel jump ! was not as racy as some of her others , because it ’s harder to write sex scenes now she is in her 70s			2
but at 76 , @entity11 , queen of the bonkbuster , has no intention of putting her pen down for good			2
her writing is not just a passion , but a necessity to pay for the round - the - clock care needed by her husband @entity19 , who was diagnosed with @entity22 ’s disease more than a decade ago and is confined to his bed			1
such is her devotion to her husband of 51 years – whom she has known since she was nine years old – that the writer would rather he be looked after at home than in residential care			1
@entity19 , 79 , was rushed into hospital on christmas eve 2011 after collapsing at home , and miss @entity11 lived in a hospital for nine weeks			1
despite often speaking of her love for the @entity33 and her awe of its hard - working doctors and nurses , she has revealed that a succession of scandals have left her - and others - unsure whether to go on supporting it			1
criticism : best - selling author @entity11 has spoken out about the erosion of trust in the @entity33 ' i think people are terrified , ' revealed @entity46			1
' one hears such scare stories			0
it 's a bit like children hearing about terrible abuse in children 's homes and being terrified of being taken away from their parent and thrust into a home			2
' there is a real blackening the name of our institutions going on at the moment			0
' now , she is determined to keep @entity19 at home in @entity65			1
‘ he ’s going to stay here , ’ she says			0
‘ it ’s sad because he has difficulty expressing himself and speaking clearly , so we have difficulty understanding what he means , which must be so frustrating for him , but he is so very brave			0
’ but her determination to care for her husband means miss @entity11 has to keep writing to pay the bills that stack up			1
‘ i ’d had a minor stroke so i could n’t do it on my own			0
i love writing anyway but i have to keep on working because i have to pay for it all			2
‘ some people say , “ gosh , we have to work until we are 70 ” , but i feel lucky that i can			1
’ tragic : @entity46 , whose husband @entity19 has @entity22 , previously championed the health service for @entity46 , the fact that she can support her husband in light of the flailing state of the @entity86 is a good thing			1
she has previously spoken warmly of the @entity33 after receiving exemplary care following a mild stroke she suffered three years ago but now says that accountability within the organisation is a growing issue			1
' some of the patients are a bit muddled and when a lady comes around with a clipboard and asks when they last saw a nurse or a doctor they say two days ago , even if it was two minutes ago and that 's what goes down on record , ' she added			1
' accident and emergency are absolutely inundated and people have so much paperwork to do			2
it 's the same with all our public services , there 's so much time wasted filling in forms			1
' as a result , and despite the challenges involved in looking after husband @entity19 , who was last seen in public at the 2005 wedding of the @entity120 and the @entity121 , @entity46 says she would never consider putting him onto a care home			1
he 's going to stay here			0
everybody loves him , he 's precious to us all			0
' it 's sad because he has difficulty expressing himself and speaking clearly , so we have difficulty understanding what he means , which must be so frustrating for him , but he is so very brave			0
' @entity11 says she is still writing , which , she adds , she needs to do to pay for the coupe 's medical bills and care			1
appearance : @entity138 was last seen in public at the nuptials of @entity120 and the @entity121 image problem : a string of recent scandals have undermined confidence in the @entity33 says @entity46 ' i 'd had a minor stroke so i could n't do it on my own			1
we have a live - in carer and extra carers coming in three times a day , who are marvellous			0
' ! t has to be paid for but the @entity33 do help with things			2
this is a big house and all the care is very expensive			0
i love writing anyway but i have to keep on working because i have to pay for it all			0
' she added : ' i think people feel guilty about growing old and needing everybody there to support them			0
' some people say , " gosh , we have to work until we are 70 , " but i feel lucky that i can			2
@entity19 's my husband and i 've got to get on with it			1
' she is currently researching her latest book on flat racing and has admitted her last novel ' jump ' was not as racy because it 's harder to write sex scenes in your 70s			2
@entity11 says her two adopted children , @entity174 , a property developer , and @entity176 , a make - up artist , have looked after her ' wonderfully '			0
it was @entity174 who noticed something was wrong when she had a minor stroke and insisted she saw a doctor - a decision which could have saved her life			0
she added : ' people do n't like old moaners			0
i 'm a great believer in laugh and the world laughs with you			0
people enjoy talking to older people because they are the key to the past and have stories to tell			0
