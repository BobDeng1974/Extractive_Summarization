thousands of women whose breast cancer has become resistant to standard treatment could benefit from a new drug combination , claim researchers			1
it is hoped the new approach will target cancer stem cells that evade conventional drugs and cause the tumour to re-grow			1
cancer that has spread and is incurable , known as secondary breast cancer , kills 1,000 women in @entity13 every month			1
researchers from @entity15 working with drug development company @entity16 , have developed a new combination of drugs which could overcome this problem			0
thousands of women whose breast cancer has become resistant to standard treatment could benefit from a new drug combination			1
it targets cancer cells that evade conventional drugs and cause tumours to re-grow they are testing the drug @entity28 in the most common type of breast cancer , affecting 70 per cent of patients			1
these ‘ oestrogen receptor ’ ( @entity34 ) cancers are currently tackled using hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen to reduce oestrogen levels or block @entity34 function			2
however , many women go on to develop resistance and the disease comes back , often because cancer stem cells which cause tumours to regrow and spread are unaffected by these treatments			1
the combination therapy , tested in mice and samples of tissue from secondary breast cancer patients , combines @entity52 with standard hormonal treatments			1
eating dinner or a snack late at night could raise a woman 's risk of breast cancer , a study has warned			2
researchers found eating meals at set times and eating dinner early reduced the risk			0
leaving a longer time between the last meal or snack of the day and breakfast lowers the chance of developing the disease , @entity65 researchers found			0
they discovered women who fasted for longer overnight had significantly better control over their blood sugar levels			0
each three hour increase in night - time fasting was associated with a four per cent lower glucose levels when tested after a meal , regardless of how much women ate , they found			0
previous research has found women with higher blood sugar levels are more likely to develop cancer , even if they do n't have diabetes			0
in the study , women reported eating five times per day and fasted overnight an average of 12 hours			0
those who reported fasting for longer also indicated they consumed fewer calories per day , ate fewer calories after 10 pm and had fewer periods of eating			0
this targets both the oestrogen - sensitive cells and the remaining cancer stem cells at the same time , says research presented at the @entity98 annual conference today			1
dr @entity99 , from the @entity15 ’s @entity100 , said : ‘ the hormonal therapies we use today are very good at treating breast cancer tumours driven by oestrogen			2
‘ however , they do n’t completely solve the problem			0
' this combination of drugs potentially allows us to target oestrogen - sensitive cells , while also mopping up the cells which cause treatment resistance			2
’ the next step will be to recruit patients for a trial in the next few months			0
dr @entity115 , head of research and development at @entity16 said : ‘ we are really excited about the data presented at the @entity98			0
' dr @entity119 and his research team have demonstrated the efficacy of @entity52			2
‘ we now intend to extend this collaboration and advance @entity52 into a clinical trial with breast cancer patients			2
’ @entity125 , at @entity126 and @entity127 , said : ‘ while it ’s important to remember that at this stage research has only been carried out in mice , this new combination of drugs shows exciting potential to overcome resistance to hormone treatments , such as tamoxifen			0
‘ combining tamoxifen with @entity52 resulted in fewer breast cancer stem cells surviving treatment compared to tamoxifen alone , lowering the likelihood of breast cancer returning or spreading to other parts of the body			1
‘ oestrogen receptor ’ cancers are currently tackled using hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen to reduce oestrogen levels or block er function			2
the new therapy targets both the oestrogen - sensitive cells and the remaining cancer stem cells ( pictured ) at the same time ‘ interestingly , dr @entity99 ’s team has also shown that this combination of drugs reduces the number of cancer stem cells in secondary breast cancer samples			1
‘ this means that the combination also has the potential to extend how long tamoxifen treatment can work for women with secondary breast cancer ( cancer that has spread ) , the incurable form of the disease			1
‘ secondary breast cancer still kills 1,000 women in the @entity13 every month so research that helps us to discover improved treatment options for women living with this form of breast cancer , or to help prevent cancer spreading , are vitally important			1
‘ we hope that planned clinical trials will follow quickly to tell us whether using tamoxifen with @entity52 is safe and can deliver similar results in humans			0

new approach targets cancer stem cells that evade conventional treatment
the cells cause tumours to re-grow , causing secondary breast cancer
treatment combines @entity52 with standard hormonal treatments
