by @entity0 buying two houses and knocking them through has long been a simple way to acquire a bigger home			1
but one tycoon is taking the concept a little further after purchasing seven houses in a row facing @entity8 in @entity9			1
@entity10 plans to knock down a few walls in the @entity13 houses to combine them into a single stuccoed ‘ super-mansion ’			1
the resulting home will be more akin to a palace , and indeed will claim the title of @entity9 's largest residence after @entity19			1
with an estimated £ 200million asking price , it will be one of the most expensive properties in @entity23			0
it will have 35 bathrooms alone , making it most unlikely there will ever be arguments about vain teenagers hogging the bathroom			1
the seven - storey pad will have 15 bedrooms including a sumptuous master suite complete with an enormous dressing room and spacious ' his and hers ' bathrooms			1
in a row : the seven @entity39 - including @entity40 and 2 @entity41 ( pictured ) and @entity42 to 10 @entity43 - are @entity44 i listed and were designed by @entity45 - the architect of @entity19 on the top floor of the house is the @entity48 - a lush private roof garden , completely invisible from street level			1
it will feature a giant sliding glass roof to allow sunbathing in hot weather , and keep out the rain during the rest of the year			0
the ' hanging gardens of @entity57 ' will be 40ft long , bigger than most ground - level gardens in the capital			0
then there is 472 - acre @entity8 itself , literally a stone 's throw away			2
as if all this were not enough , the property is also going to be extended - underground			0
with land in @entity9 like gold dust , the subterranean extension will create a leisure complex with a swimming pool , jacuzzi , pool bar and cinema			2
also involved : the resulting home - which includes @entity40 6 to 10 @entity43 ( pictured ) will be more akin to a palace , and indeed will claim the title of @entity9 's largest residence after @entity19 the property will have 50,000 sq ft of living space			1
and , in the manner of a grand stately home , it will boast a grand spiral staircase , a banqueting room , a billiards room , a library , children 's rooms and a smoking room			2
the seven @entity91 6 to 10 @entity43 and @entity40 and 2 @entity41 - are @entity44 i listed and were designed by @entity45 - the architect of @entity19			2
developer : @entity10 , 46 , has spent the past 20 years buying some of the capital 's finest homes in recent years , they have been used as cramped office space , and the local authority has granted planning permission to restore them to residential use			1
@entity101 rejected objections from local conservationists who wanted the houses to be several individual homes rather than a single dwelling , but @entity108 has backed the project			2
property mogul @entity10 paid £ 23.7million in 2007 to buy the seven houses from the @entity111			2
developer mr @entity10 , 46 , has spent the past 20 years buying some of the capital 's finest homes			1
in april , he sold three terraces nearby for £ 120million to the @entity115 royal family			0
this latest project is the biggest so far , and will take nearly three years to complete			0
experts expect the vast home to be purchased by an oligarch from @entity120 or a @entity122 royal family			0
if it is sold for £ 200million , that is 1,229 times more expensive than the @entity23 average house price of £ 162,606			0
at that asking price , the buyer will face a £ 14million bill for stamp duty			0
despite the shaky economic recovery , 2012 was a record year for sales in @entity9 worth more than £ 5million , according to research by estate agent @entity133			0
another @entity45 property , 18 @entity136 , was recently put on the market for £ 250million , making it the @entity23 's most expensive home if it reaches its asking price .			0
