by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 published : 13:13 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 04:18 est , 18 march 2013 the mother of the @entity1 rape victim has forgiven one of the boys who violated and degraded her daughter			1
the extraordinary act of grace came as @entity10 , 16 , broke down and wept for his crime as the verdict was delivered to a highly charged courtroom			2
approaching the victim ’s mother he said : ‘ i ’m so very sorry			1
’ she responded : ‘ i know you are and i forgive you			1
speaking to @entity54 outside the @entity55 , the family ’s solicitor , @entity52 , said : ‘ it ’s a very religious , spiritual family			2
they are praying for those two young men also			2
’ the family ’s priest , father @entity59 , had been in court throughout the grueling trial and described them as very active members of @entity66 ’s @entity65 in @entity67			2
but asked if the victim too had forgiven the boys who betrayed her trust , humiliated her and preyed on her when she was at her most vulnerable mr @entity52 said : ‘ i think she was prepared to do that			2
she came here wanting to forgive them but she has n’t made that decision yet			2
’ he continued : ‘ this thing might have never happened had someone approached the family sooner			2
‘ they are a very religious family			2
they would have accepted an apology at the time			2
’ the victim was not in court to hear the verdict delivered			1
@entity86 of footballer guilty of rape ( contains content some may find upsetting ) together : @entity38 , 17 , left , gets a hug from his father after @entity38 and co-defendant @entity20 , 16 , were found delinquent on rape and other chargesk @entity35 @entity25 covers his eyes and cries as his attorney @entity96 , standing , asks the court for leniency after @entity25 and co-defendant @entity38 , lower left , were found delinquent on rape and other charges today guilty : @entity20 , top , hugs his mother @entity103 , after closing arguments were made on the fourth day of the juvenile trial on saturday family members console each other as judge @entity39 ( not shown ) delivers the verdicts in the trial of @entity20 , 16 and @entity38 , 17 , in juvenile court in @entity1 , @entity2 , march 17 , 2013 crime : @entity38 and @entity25 were today found guilty of digitally penetrating a 16 - year - old @entity113 girl at a party last august according to mr @entity52 : ‘ it is a sad day			1
why should she be part of that sadness ? ’ it has , he explained , been hard enough for her to endure the days of testimony and of waiting for the moment she had long dreaded – taking the stand			0
that anxiety and nervousness was only worsened by the fact that her testimony was twice delayed in a trial with days at time running to a marathon 13 - and - a - half hours			0
mr @entity52 said : ‘ there has been a lot of hand holding and hugs and a lot of anxiousness and nerves			0
’ and though she may not have forgiven the boys who have put her through so much she has , he said , shown remarkable compassion for them			0
judge @entity39 talks from the bench to the families of @entity38 and @entity35 after he pronounced them delinquent on rape and other charges after their trial in juvenile court in @entity1 , @entity2 apologies : @entity38 , 17 , left , stands and apologizes to the victim and her family after he and co-defendant @entity20 , 16 , were found delinquent on rape and other charges he said : ‘ this was very difficult for her to go through			1
you saw her break down			0
‘ she ’s always felt bad for the boys			0
she ’s pretty strong but she ’s a 16 year old girl who did n’t want to get anybody into trouble			0
‘ these boys accused themselves			0
she actually liked one of them			0
she had a crush on him			0
’ now it is highly likely that a civil case will be brought against the defendants and though mr @entity52 would not be drawn on the timing of any such action he has confirmed that he is representing the family in the matter , adding : ‘ remorse did come late in my opinion			0
’ and in emotional scenes today both defendants @entity38 , 17 , and @entity10 , 16 , wept uncontrollably as judge @entity39 handed down his verdict , describing their actions as ‘ profane and ugly			1
’ as @entity38 and @entity25 were comforted by their attorneys and their families sobbed , prosecutor @entity176 pressed for a stern sentencing reminding the judge : ‘ they showed absolutely no regard for what happened to the victim			1
verdict : two protestors hug outside the @entity186 after hearing the verdict in the trial ‘ in the case of @entity38 once the information got out , there was a very conscious decision to turn it on her			1
‘ the lack of remorse was appalling ’ today , as both @entity199 students faced the reality of the consequences of what happened that august night last year , their remorse appeared overwhelming			2
both have been sentence to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with the maximum stay of until they are 21			0
@entity38 faced an additional charge of the use and dissemination of nude images of a minor			1
he received the same sentence for that to run consecutively			0
his minimum detention is two years			0
his actions were , according to @entity218 , ‘ more egregious ’ making it inappropriate that he should face the same sentence as @entity25			1
@entity25 ’s father , @entity221 , who has been present in court every day made his way over to his son , fell to his knees and told him that he loved him			1
‘ my life is ruined , ’ @entity10 told attorney his @entity96 , who was clearly shocked at the verdict			2
@entity230 father , @entity229 , held his head in his hands as the defendant ’s sister @entity233 and mother wept			2
both defendants took the opportunity to address the victim and her family – present for the verdict and visible to the defendants but out of view of the main court in a screened off section of seating			1
@entity38 was composed as he said : ‘ i would like to apologize to [ the victim ] and her family , my family and the community			1
no pictures should have been sent let alone ever taken			0
’ but though @entity38 apologized quite specifically for taking pictures of the victim and sending them nowhere did he mention or offer an apology for the rape			1
in every communication with the victim following the night of 11 -12 august he repeatedly denied raping her			2
in fact in an incriminating detail it is an allegation he denies before it is ever made			0
again and again his texts show him turning the blame on the victim , hectoring her , pressurizing her not to go to the police and telling her that the rape ‘ did n’t happen			1
’ small town : both defendants played football for @entity199 's team @entity199 standing in court , convicted of that crime and filled with apparent regret , the rape remained a crime for which he does not apologize			1
when it came to @entity25 ’s turn , he walked towards the victim and her family , across the courtroom , weeping ; ‘ i would like to apologize			1
i had no intention to put you guys through this			0
i do n’t know what to say			0
‘ i ruined her life			0
’ at this , he could no longer speak because he was overcome with tears , and was walked back to this seat by @entity284 , chief probation officer for @entity55			0
apologies followed from @entity286 , @entity287 – @entity25 ’s guardian who , along with his wife @entity289 have been in court every day			1
the @entity291 ’s have spoken openly about their support for @entity25 and love for him ‘ whatever happened			1
’ today in court they appeared emotionally shattered			1
@entity25 was not in their care when the events took place			1
on the map : the working class town of @entity1 , located in eastern @entity2 , has a population of around 18,000 across days of often appalling testimony the court has heard texts , tweets and emails between the defendants and their friends			1
they have heard about pictures , been reminded of vile video rants and seen the reality of what these boys did and how they behaved , who they were , when nobody else was looking			0
the case has scandalized @entity319 and scarred the small town of @entity1 , @entity2			1
@entity38 and @entity25 will begin their sentence today			1
they will be taken to an institute just northwest of @entity325 , @entity2 where they will be assessed and a decision made as to where they should spend their time in custody			0
‘ so much of what happens with their future depends upon their attitude and how they embrace their rehabilitation , ’ said judge @entity39			0
‘ there is plenty of room to demonstrate your good character			0
there is also plenty of room to make mistakes			0
’ we 're sorry but reader comments are currently unavailable .			0

mother of rape victim told @entity20 today in court that she forgives him for his crimes of @entity1 rape
