by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 striker @entity2 insists everyone at the club has overcome the heartbreak of last season			1
the @entity8 were in the hunt to end a title drought dating back to 1990 , only for a defeat at home to @entity13 and a draw at @entity15 to hand the initiative to @entity17 , who went on to pip them by two points			1
it was a devastating end to a campaign when for the majority of the last two months the feeling was that the club stood on the verge of something extra special			0
but @entity2 stressed the squad had put that behind them			1
' that is something i ca n't wait to play in and the players ca n't wait to play in			2
' it took a while ( to get over the disappointment )			0
it is not easy to get over things like that but everyone is over that now and we look forward to the future and hopefully bringing success the club			0
' while @entity3 's 2 - 1 win over @entity34 was far from impressive , they are at least off and running , but following the £ 75million departure of @entity73 to @entity74 their chances of finishing in the top four have been written off by many critics			1
it is not a concern for @entity2 , his team - mates or manager @entity80 , and the @entity83 striker said the players were not reading too much into their first performance			1
video new signings excellent - @entity31 good business : @entity2 is pleased with the new additions brought in by manager @entity80 gone : @entity73 in the colours of @entity74 after his £ 75m move away from @entity90 ' we have confidence within ourselves , we have a belief within the squad we can win every game - no matter what the opposition - with the philosophies the manager has and the individuals we have and how they work collectively , ' added the 24 - year - old			1
' getting off to a good start is fantastic for us but we understand it is only one game and there are 37 to go			0
' it is very early on in the season to be making predictions of who is going to win the league and who are going to be the top four			2
' i think we go about our business silently			0
last season we were underdogs and this season we are underdogs , i do n't think it changes			2
' the manager has made great signings and we look forward to the future and having a successful season because everyone is hungry for success			0
