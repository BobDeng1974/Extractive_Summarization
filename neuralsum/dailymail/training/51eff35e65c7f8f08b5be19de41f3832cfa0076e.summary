by @entity0 published : 07:59 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 01:50 est , 19 june 2013 for many cooks , separating an egg yolk from the white is a messy business			2
as you juggle the yolk back and forth between the halves of the egg , your fingers get stickier and stickier as the white drains away			2
then , more often than not , you have to pick stray bits of shell out of the bowl			0
now one entrepreneur has come up with a device which he believes will do away with all that			2
it costs £ 18 , plus £ 4 shipping costs , and comes in six colours			1
the @entity32 was launched as a @entity34 campaign in january and raised more than three times the target amount crack an egg gently into a bowl - multiple eggs can be cracked into the same bowl as long as they do n't split			0
hold the @entity20 above an egg yolk so it is just touching the surface - be careful not to put too much pressure on and cause the yolk to split			1
squeeze the coloured flexible plastic part of the @entity20 to such the yolk from the white			1
the yolk will sit in the plastic holder at the bottom of the gadget			1
place the @entity20 over the mixing bowl or plate where you want the yolk to go and squeeze the @entity20 again to release the yolk			1
after the egg has been cracked into a bowl the gadget , which works like a pipette , sucks up the yolk into a wide - mouthed plastic nozzle when the rubber top is squeezed			1
it then holds the yolk safely until the cook is ready to use it , when with another squeeze of the top it plops it back out in one piece			2
@entity69 , a mechanical engineer , came up with the idea last year after watching a friend painstakingly trying to split eggs – and failing			0
' after making a real mess , and having to dig egg shells out of the bowl , she said that there must be a better way of doing it , ' said mr @entity69 , 30 , from @entity80 , @entity19			0
' i did a little bit of research and came up with a very basic idea for a tool that sucks the yolk out of the white			2
' i thought if i could make something that worked well and looked good i could be on to something			0
' ten months later the device , known as the @entity91 , is about to appear on the shelves in @entity93 , costing £ 18			1
mr @entity69 added : ' the trick was getting the shape of the nozzle right so it did n't break the yolk when it was sucked up			0
' there were many , many eggs of all shapes and sizes broken in the testing stages , but we got there in the end			0
' the benefits are the cleanliness and the hygiene			0
the traditional ways of splitting eggs involve the yolks and the whites touching hands or the outsides of the shells			0
it is a lot quicker and you do n't run the risk of breaking the yolk			0
' recipes calling for yolks to be separated from whites include meringue , mousse , souffle and creme brulee			0
yolks are used to make mayonnaise , custard and sponge cakes			0
@entity69 claims the @entity20 is so easy to use he successfully tested it on his 90 - year - old grandfather			2
to suck the egg yolk from the white , hold the @entity20 above it and squeeze the coloured plastic top			1
the yolk will be sucked into the plastic case			1
squeeze the @entity20 again to release the yolk not only can the yolk be removed from the white without leaving any residue , it can also be popped back out of the device in one piece			1
yolks are used for mayonnaise and custard , among other recipes and designer @entity69 plans to release a @entity20 recipe book if his stretch target of £ 80,000 on @entity34 is met support the @entity91 project at yolkr.com or on @entity149			1

it works like a pipette by sucking the yolk cleanly into an *attached* plastic case before being squeezed out in one piece
*materials* and device have been approved by the @entity28
the @entity20 costs £ 18 and comes in six colours
