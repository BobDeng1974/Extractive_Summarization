the 2015 @entity0 is almost upon us with the festive fun set to commence at the @entity3 in @entity4 on thursday			1
@entity5 begins his defence of the title he won last year , but the likes of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are all hungry to wrestle the @entity12 away from the @entity13			1
twenty sessions of top tungsten spread over a 17 - day period over @entity17 and @entity18 will decide who is the best darts player on the planet , and here is our guide to the big tournament			0
@entity24 , @entity5 and @entity9 get ready for the 2015 @entity0 @entity9 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) are the two favourites for the title at @entity3 the @entity28 tweeted a picture showing @entity3 being set up for the tournament @entity31 : standout moments @entity9 has more world titles , but i 'll buy more houses ... the main contenders @entity5 the reigning world champion and no 1 seed for this year 's tournament , @entity25 is among the favourites to win the title again			1
having been beaten by @entity9 in the 2013 final , the @entity13 bounced back in 2014 to beat @entity24 and lift the @entity43			2
@entity25 has won the @entity44 and @entity45 this year , and begins his title defence against @entity47 on the opening night at @entity3			1
@entity25 won his first world title last year ( right ) and will be looking to retain his crown the @entity13 will play @entity47 on the opening night of the 2015 tournament at @entity3 @entity53 2013 @entity9 's preparations overshadowed by illness to his mother @entity9 what more needs to be said about the power than the fact he is a 16 - time world champion ? @entity9 has accomplished everything in the game of darts and has nothing to prove			1
@entity9 is the pre-tournament favourite at @entity3 , and he begins his quest on friday night against @entity68 @entity67			1
@entity9 has had some personal issues to deal with leading up to the tournament with his mum @entity71 suffering from a lung infection			2
it remains to be seen how much his mum 's illness affects his performance at @entity3			0
@entity9 will enter the competition on friday night when he faces @entity68 @entity67 in the first round the stage is set up at the @entity3 in north @entity4 ahead of the tournament 2014 - @entity5 2013 - @entity9 2012 - @entity10 2011 - @entity10 2010 - @entity9 2009 - @entity9 2008 - @entity81 2007 - @entity82 2006 - @entity9 2005 - @entity9 @entity10 jackpot is a two - time world champion having won the title in both 2011 and 2012			1
but on both occasions since then , @entity10 has run into a red - hot @entity25 , losing 5 - 4 in a thrilling quarter - final in 2013 and 6 - 0 in the semi-final 12 months ago			1
@entity10 enters the tournament as the no 3 seed and opens his campaign against @entity92			2
it 's a tricky section of the draw he finds himself in , though , with potential matches with @entity82 and @entity9 on the way to the final			0
@entity11 the @entity98 has enjoyed a resurgence this year , entering the @entity100 as the no 4 seed on the back of his win at the @entity105 , his first appearance in a premier event final for three years			0
@entity11 took @entity3 by storm in 2011 with his stunning scoring but came up short in the final , losing 7 - 5 to @entity10			1
but @entity11 's life turned upside down soon after that when he lost both his brother @entity113 and father @entity114 in a short space of time			2
@entity11 admitted that times were tough , but he seems to be back to his best on the oche now			0
@entity10 won back - to - back titles in 2011 and 2012 , but has been beaten by @entity25 both times since @entity11 is returning to his best form this year and is one of the favourites for the title @entity24 having never previously been past the third round at the @entity0 , @entity24 produced a remarkable run all the way to the final in 2014			1
the man known as ' @entity131 ' was eventually beaten by @entity25 in the final , but he won many admirers , not least for his extravagant hair styles and dress sense			0
@entity24 stunned everybody at @entity3 last year when he made it all the way to the final video ' snakebite ' prepares the hair @entity139 @entity139 has won all there is to win in darts , apart from the world title			1
he has never even appeared in the final at @entity3 , twice losing in the semi-finals			0
@entity139 may never get a better chance at the title than in 2012 , when he was 5 - 1 up in the semi-final against @entity10 and somehow lost 6 - 5			2
still , his experience and performances this year make it hard to exclude him from the list of contenders for the title			0
should he get past @entity156 in the first round , a potential second - round clash with @entity155 world champion @entity154 could await him			1
@entity139 has won every major trophy in the @entity28 apart from the @entity100 @entity154 the winner of the @entity155 title last year makes his debut in the @entity28 version of the world championship this year			0
he made the switch from the @entity155 to the @entity28 in january and produced solid , if not spectacular , results , including making the semi-finals of the @entity44 and the @entity68 masters			0
@entity154 is the sixth favourite for the tournament , as his lowly @entity171 seeding means he could be facing no 6 seed @entity139 in the second round			0
@entity154 will make his debut at @entity3 having won the @entity155 world title last year @entity82 it has been a long time since @entity176 produced his best at the @entity100			2
since winning the 2007 world title , the best @entity178 has managed is a final appearance in 2009 and semi-final defeats in 2010 and 2013			0
@entity176 is seeded as low as 14 , which means a potential third - round clash with @entity10 awaits him			0
but if the @entity185 champion finds his groove at the oche , he will be a tough man to beat			0
@entity82 won the @entity185 earlier this year and is looking for a sixth world title @entity9 - 7/4 @entity5 - 11/4 @entity11 - 13/2 @entity10 - 12/1 @entity139 - 16/1 @entity154 - 22/1 @entity24 - 33/1 @entity189 - 33/1 @entity82 - 50/1 @entity190 - 66/1 @entity191 - 66/1 @entity192 - 66/1 @entity193 - 66/1 @entity194 - 80/1 @entity195 - 100/1 click here to bet now with coral tournament schedule first and preliminary rounds thursday december 18 @entity81 ( 30 ) v @entity200 @entity203 v @entity201 ( p ) @entity204 ( 29 ) v @entity205 @entity5 ( 1 ) v @entity47 @entity206 ( 13 ) v @entity203 / @entity201 two - time champion of the world @entity81 will play the opening match of the tournament on thursday @entity53 moments - part v @entity212 reigning champion @entity25 is the star attraction on the opening night at @entity3 friday december 19 @entity215 ( 12 ) v @entity216 @entity219 v @entity217 ( p ) @entity24 ( 5 ) v @entity220 @entity9 ( 2 ) v @entity67 @entity221 ( 32 ) v @entity219 / @entity217 @entity215 will begin friday 's action at @entity3 before @entity9 's entrance @entity190 plays on saturday night saturday december 20 @entity224 @entity225 ( 28 ) v @entity226 @entity229 v @entity227 ( p ) @entity230 ( 17 ) v @entity231 @entity194 ( 9 ) v @entity232 @entity233 ( 24 ) v @entity229 / @entity227 evening session @entity235 ( 21 ) v @entity236 @entity239 v @entity237 ( p ) @entity195 ( 16 ) v @entity240 @entity190 ( 7 ) v @entity241 @entity11 ( 4 ) v @entity239 / @entity237 sunday december 21 @entity224 @entity242 ( 25 ) v @entity243 @entity246 v @entity244 ( p ) @entity247 ( 31 ) v @entity248 @entity249 ( 26 ) v @entity250 @entity251 ( 20 ) v @entity246 / @entity244 evening session @entity191 ( 18 ) v @entity253 @entity256 v @entity254 ( p ) @entity189 ( 8 ) v @entity257 @entity139 ( 6 ) v @entity156 @entity258 ( 15 ) v @entity256 / @entity254 @entity24 also features alongside @entity215 and @entity9 on a star - studded friday night monday december 22 @entity260 ( 19 ) v @entity261 @entity264 v @entity262 ( p ) @entity192 ( 22 ) v @entity265 @entity82 ( 14 ) v @entity267 - @entity266 @entity268 ( 11 ) v @entity264 / @entity262 tuesday december 23 @entity269 ( 23 ) v @entity270 @entity273 v @entity271 ( p ) @entity193 ( 10 ) v @entity274 @entity10 ( 3 ) v @entity92 @entity154 ( 27 ) v @entity273 / @entity271 second round - saturday 27 december - monday 29 december third round - monday 29 december - tuesday 30 december quarter - finals - thursday 1 january - friday 2 january semi-finals - saturday 3 january @entity277 - sunday 4 january			1
