an @entity1 seller last night revealed her horror at accidentally including a naked view of herself when she posted a picture of a dress for sale on the website			1
@entity10 , 21 , hung the mustard yellow skater dress by @entity12 on her wardrobe door to photograph it for listing			1
but she failed to notice her own reflection in the door mirror , camera in hand , and in just a black bra and no knickers			0
the post soon went viral and now the blunder has sparked a flurry of fake @entity1 sale ads for the yellow dress with fictional characters accidentally making an appearance			1
mirror , mirror : @entity10 , from @entity30 , did not realise she had captured herself half - naked in a mirror when she snapped the dress to sell on @entity1 bit more demure : she re-listed the item on @entity1 and this time covered up with a black coat			1
it has attracted bids of £ 153 , 911 so far one @entity1 user went to the added effort of posting several pictures featuring @entity42 in his role as mr @entity44 in the first @entity46 film modelling the yellow dress the original image and mock - ups have since been shared on @entity50 with the hash tag # ebayyellowskaterdress			1
@entity52 , from @entity30 , told @entity53 : ' it 's so embarrassing			0
it is such a dizzy , stupid thing to do and now the whole world 's seen me in the nude			0
' i put it on @entity1 last saturday morning and realised straight away so ended the sale			2
but what i did n't realise was that people could still it on the site			0
' i reported it to @entity1 and they took it down , but by then it had gone viral			2
my boyfriend @entity67 thinks the whole thing is hilarious			0
' @entity69 hit : copycat hoaxers have posted their own versions of the original @entity1 blunder - but this joke ad featuring @entity42 as mr @entity44 in the first @entity46 film only attracted a top bid of £ 9.50 a dress for all occasions : the @entity1 user also helpfully posted a selection of pics of mr @entity44 showing the dress off in a variety of locations the new listing read : ' @entity12 yellow skater dress size 10 , 2nd time round ! ! a must have ! ! ' as seen by thousands			1
' bizarrely the listing caused a stir among @entity1 users			2
originally listed at £ 15.99 , the dress has received more than 130 bids and reached more than £ 153,000			1
the picture brought mixed reaction on internet forums			0
one user commented : ' it is a shocking dress '			0
@entity52 , who has the user id sugart * t - 2 , relisted the dress with a similarly - posed picture but this time covered up in a dark @entity103 top			2
very versatile : it appears even fictional fauns can pull off the yellow skater dress with ease joker : another hoax ad featured a slightly bigger seller reflected in the mirror but it did n't manage to attract any bids			0

@entity10 posted pic of yellow dress on @entity1 , without noticing reflection
eye - catching dress fails to draw attention from her naked bottom half
she *re-posted* the item , which attracted a bid of more than £ 153,000
