by @entity0 published : 06:09 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 06:11 est , 27 september 2013 until recently , @entity1 , 47 , from @entity2 in @entity3 , was a big fan of @entity4 in more ways than one - tipping the scales at an unhealthy 20st			1
now the devoted football fan has lost half of her body weight after getting stuck in the turnstiles at @entity13 's @entity12 stadium			1
embarrassingly , two stewards then had to haul her hefty frame through the narrow entrance in front of jeering supporters			2
she slims , she scores ! the newly slimline @entity1 shows off her slender new size 12 frame fat fan slim : @entity1 , pictured with @entity4 's @entity23 , has lost a staggering 10st in two years @entity1 , who had gone to the stadium to watch the rugby challenge cup final , was so embarrassed she spent the first half crying in the toilets			1
' i did n't think i was going to be able to get through the turnstile , ' remembers @entity1 who works as a bookmaker			1
' i turned sideways on but i just got stuck and two stewards had to pull my arms and i had to get a push from behind			0
' i was absolutely devastated and i was so embarrassed			0
it was in front of all these teenage boys from the rugby team and their dads			0
' the sports fan was so upset by the incident , she decided to give up her treasured season ticket at @entity4 's @entity43 , worried she was taking up too much room			0
favourite : a tubby @entity1 ( right ) poses with @entity47 former @entity4 player , @entity46 @entity48 : @entity50 international @entity49 was another favourite player of @entity1 's heavyweight : @entity1 was so embarrassed by the @entity12 incident , she gave up her season ticket ' i gave up my @entity4 season ticket after 14 years because i did n't want to be seen out and about			2
' there were times that i would n't go out for a walk because i was scared that if i fell over i would n't be able to get back up			0
' when i was sitting on the seats at the football i was conscious that i was overhanging and sitting on somebody 's lap. ' but despite the humiliation , the incident has proven to be a blessing in disguise for @entity1 , who , determined never to repeat it , went on to lose 10st by swapping unhealthy @entity70 food for fruit and yoghurt			1
@entity1 , who is divorced , piled on the pounds as a child and got even fatter after developing a penchant for comfort eating as a teenager			2
happier : @entity1 , who won @entity3 slimmer of the year , is now on the waiting list for a new season ticket by the time she reached her late 20s , she weighed 21st and needed a walking stick to follow her team around @entity84			2
but over the last two years , @entity1 , who says her favourite players are @entity46 and @entity49 , has slimmed from a size 34 dress to a trim size 12			1
she was named @entity89 2013 and is now taking part in a national competition to be @entity92 's slimmer of the year			0
@entity1 has also started going back to see her beloved @entity4 - and is on the waiting list to become a season ticket holder once again .			0
