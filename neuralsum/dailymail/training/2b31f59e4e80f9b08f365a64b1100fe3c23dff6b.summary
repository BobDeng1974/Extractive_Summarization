neither can the suffering , the hurt or the violence of the conflict be disowned by @entity158 or any other party to the conflict			0

mr @entity214 , from @entity36 , said : ' it makes me feel ill being within 100 yards of him			2
i 'm here for a reason and that reason is that man 's murky , violent past			2
