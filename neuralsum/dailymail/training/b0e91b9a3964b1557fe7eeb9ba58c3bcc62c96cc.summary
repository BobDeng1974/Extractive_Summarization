by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 fans will be wondering whether they 'll have a team left to support when the @entity5 kicks off in the three weeks time as the summer exodus down on the south coast shows no signs of stopping			1
following @entity3 's impressive eighth - placed finish last season , it was expected certain members of the squad would move on			1
as it was , boyhood @entity14 moved to @entity17 for £ 4million and was followed to @entity18 by @entity19 who joined @entity21 ' side in a £ 23million deal			1
now , with still six weeks of the transfer window remaining , it was announced on friday that @entity48 is on the brink of joining up with @entity19 and @entity14 on @entity50			1
just as that news was sinking in , @entity3 supporters then had to hear young right - back @entity53 is all set for a £ 12m switch to @entity56			2
' when will it stop ? ' followers of the club must be thinking			0
perhaps once @entity60 - heavily linked with @entity41 - joins up with former @entity3 boss @entity38 at @entity61 ? yes , even the manager departed			1
after that , bad boy @entity63 will likely return to @entity65 with @entity66 keen on the former @entity68 striker while frontman @entity69 , interesting both @entity41 and @entity17 , has at least been offered a five - year contract to ward off any potential suitors			1
plenty to shout about : @entity3 centre - back @entity48 is on the brink of a £ 20million switch to @entity17 soon to be rivals ? @entity53 is moving to @entity56 while @entity60 is wanted by @entity41 with barely anybody left to play , the question has to be asked : why have @entity3 stood aside to see most of their playing squad jump ship ? it seems there 's been no fight , no ' hands off warnings ' , nothing			1
such is the nature of the @entity5 , any players with a smidgen of talent who perform well for an entire season will undoubtedly be hoovered up by the big boys			2
however , boasting a squad of such quality , the club could have done more in an attempt to keep much of the side together			0
where is the ambition ? often these situations turn into long - running transfer sagas with the player either switching on august 31 or staying put			0
not for @entity3 , they 've been quick to strike deals			2
@entity3 are in a strong financial position and could have easily told interested parties that the club 's best players were not for sale			1
instead , they chose to roll over and cash in at the first opportunity			0
of course , while it is wise to think about harmony among the camp and the damaging influence a player who does n't want to be there can have on the dressing room , @entity3 must also consider the fact that you need 11 players to play a football match - at this rate , that wo n't be possible			2
bad boy : @entity66 are keen on signing @entity63 who joined the @entity3 from @entity68 last summer on target : frontman @entity69 has at least been offered a new deal to ward off any potential suitors would half the team have left had former executive chairman @entity129 remained at the club ? the @entity132 , who stepped down from his role at @entity39 's over alleged ' differences ' with owner @entity136 , is adamant the squad would still be together if he was still there			1
speaking to @entity140 in may , @entity129 said : ' i knew the players themselves wanted to stick together because this vision was something they believed in , too			0
i did n’t see any reason for them to go			0
' we created those talents			0
it was key to keep them			0
you do n't produce them just to sell , otherwise you give away your ambition			0
' i did n’t have written offers , but i obviously had phone calls			0
my answer was that it was not going to happen for at least the next two seasons			0
' the other chairmen respected that			0
until the day i left , there were no offers			0
' adamant : @entity129 believes @entity3 's star men would have stayed had he remained in charge following the mass departures , it is now up to new manager @entity167 to start the rebuild job			1
the @entity169 arrived from @entity170 earlier this summer and has already raided his former club for £ 8million striker @entity25			1
@entity172 wideman @entity23 , a £ 10.3million signing from @entity173 , has also arrived but @entity167 , with just two new signings so far , has his work cut out in replacing so many vital players in just over a month			2
if @entity167 is given the majority of funds from the countless player sales , @entity3 should have nothing to worry about			2
they may even be buoyed if the money is invested in the infrastructure of the club			0
tough task : new manager @entity167 must essentially build a @entity3 first team from scratch floored : new @entity3 striker @entity25 looks on during the @entity3 ' friendly win over @entity188 however , 51 - year - old @entity167 has essentially been tasked with building a squad from scratch that is capable of finishing in the top - half of the table			1
that 's a whole load of players who will need to gel in a short space of time			0
@entity3 's recent successes have stemmed from the club 's esteemed academy but it must n't be assumed that top players will continue to come coming through and so the club have to spend			1
having seemingly stepped aside to see almost the entire first - team move on , time will tell if @entity3 have taken the right action this summer			1
making plans : @entity167 and new wideman @entity23 chat on the training field in @entity210			2

@entity3 have sold a number of the club 's star players this summer
@entity33 signed for @entity34 in a £ 30million deal
@entity19 and @entity14 both joined @entity17
@entity48 expected to join for @entity3 *duo* at @entity18
*midfielder* @entity60 could join @entity38 at @entity41
@entity69 interesting @entity222 and @entity41 while @entity63 may join @entity66
saints finished eighth in @entity5 last season
@entity167 tasked with rebuilding first - team
@entity169 so far signed @entity25 and @entity23 from @entity229
