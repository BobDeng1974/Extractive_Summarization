' last photo ' : among the images on the camera was this one showing @entity190 in the shower before his death possessive : the jury was shown a picture of @entity56 in a t - shirt @entity22 made reading ' @entity2 's ' @entity197 , an attorney for @entity56 , told jurors her client acted in self - defense after @entity22 ' lunged at @entity201 in anger ' in his suburban @entity60 home after she dropped his new camera			1
