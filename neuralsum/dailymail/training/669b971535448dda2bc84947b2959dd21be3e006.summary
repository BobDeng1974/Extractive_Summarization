by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 08:31 est , 15 august 2013 the eurozone yesterday came out of its longest recession since the single currency was launched in 1999 – but economists warned that the crisis is far from over			1
the continent is still so blighted by rampant youth unemployment and staggering levels of government debt that even the @entity11 commissioner responsible for the 17 - nation bloc warned against premature celebrations			1
economists did welcome the signs of recovery in the eurozone , which has been mired in a slump for 18 months , but said there is a long way to go before the 300 million - plus citizens of the single currency area can expect an end to their misery			1
on the up : the combined economies of the 17 eurozone countries grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2013 figures released yesterday show the eurozone ’s economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first three months , finally ending the recession that first hit the single currency area in the final three months of 2011			1
the crisis afflicting the region has thrown millions onto the dole queues and provoked a wave of violent protests on the streets as governments have tried to revive their economies and reduce their excessive borrowing through draconian austerity measures			1
it threatens to create a ‘ lost generation ’ of young people unable to find jobs			0
the youth unemployment rate is nearly 24 per cent for the euro area overall , and a crippling 58.7 per cent in @entity50 and 56.1 per cent in @entity51			1
official figures also revealed that while stronger nations are returning to growth , weaker countries are still struggling			1
@entity57 , the region ’s industrial powerhouse , grew by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and the @entity61 economy managed growth of 0.5 per cent , both better results than experts had predicted			2
@entity65 : there are 300,000 more people in work since the same time in 2012 , and two thirds of the jobs have gone to @entity71 but @entity51 and @entity72 were still in recession , and comparative figures for troubled @entity50 are not yet available			0
the growth rate of minus 4.6 per cent in @entity50 is compared with last year rather than the first three months of this			2
@entity79 ’s economic monetary affairs commissioner @entity77 said the figures suggested the @entity79 economy was gradually gaining momentum , but added that there was no room for complacency			0
‘ there are still substantial obstacles to overcome : the growth figures remain low and the tentative signs of growth are still fragile , ’ he said			2
despite the improved growth figures , weaker eurozone nations are still beset by problems including high unemployment , particularly among the young , enormous public debt burdens , crippled banking systems and poor competitiveness			2
commentators say the eurozone as a whole is also held back by rigid labour market laws			0
the overall eurozone growth rate of 0.3 per cent in the second quarter compares with 0.6 per cent in the @entity104 , 0.4 per cent in the @entity105 and 0.6 per cent in @entity106 , according to the @entity108 statistics agency @entity107			1
@entity109 , economist with independent forecaster @entity110 , said : ‘ there is an underlying impetus towards recovery but the eurozone is not out of the woods yet			0
maybe it is a little bit nearer the edge of the woods			0
’ the consulting firm @entity119 commented : ‘ although these figures are welcome , doubts about the sustainability of this recovery persist			0
these figures do not signal the all - clear for the euro crisis			1
’ members of the zone were hit by three major problems			0
first , by taking advantage of interest rates set at low levels to suit the prudent @entity57 , poorer countries were able to rack up huge debts , which they then struggled to repay			2
second , when the 2008 financial crisis hit , they had no control over either interest rates or their own currency			1
third , in return for bailouts , countries such as @entity50 and @entity142 had to sign up to tough austerity policies			0
@entity146 , chief economist at accountant @entity147 , said : ‘ recovery has to start somewhere , but the periphery countries are still in a lot of trouble			0

17 countries using single currency grows by 0.3 *%* , more than expected
@entity108 warns against *claiming* ' the crisis is over '
but growth from the euro bloc should provide a boost to @entity104 *exports*
