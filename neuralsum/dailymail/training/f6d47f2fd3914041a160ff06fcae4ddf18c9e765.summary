by @entity1 reporter published : 06:15 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 06:15 est , 17 october 2013 it 's a death defying craze favoured by daredevil ' rooftoppers ' aiming to take photography to new heights			0
but it seems that ' skywalking ' - the dangerous art of scaling tall buildings or cranes to take a picture from a vertigo inducing perspective while sometimes performing tricks and stunts in the process - is nothing new			0
these stunning images , taken from the archives at the @entity20 , show that brave souls were foolishly frolicking around at dizzying heights in the 1930s			2
death - defying : a @entity25 steeplejack performs a handstand on the head of the @entity28 during it 's restoration in 1938 brave : a @entity25 steeplejack clings on to the @entity28 's tablet while working on the iconic landmark the most striking of the images shows one @entity25 steeplejack showing a complete disregard for his own personal safety and performing a pretty risky handstand while on top of the @entity28			1
another picture shows the worker clinging on to the tablet that @entity28 clutches in her left hand seemingly completely oblivious to the dizzying drop below			0
the steeplejack , whose footprints can be seen on the statue 's crown in the picture , was working on its restoration in 1938			1
other photographs show men climbing to the very top of the @entity57 in @entity25 , and a worker carving part of @entity61 's face into the rock at @entity63			1
the photographs were taken between 1917 and 1934			0
@entity64 for heights : @entity66 working on the top of the @entity68 in @entity25 living the high life : these men pictured working high above the @entity25 skyline are one of the few in the pictures that appear to be using safety ropes historic work : a man works on a carving of former @entity79 president @entity61 at @entity63 , @entity80 tough job : @entity83 ( front ) and @entity82 fitting lights to the @entity86 in 1964 a later image , taken from 1964 shows that @entity89 men had an equally good head for heights			1
the picture shows two workers fitting lights to the @entity94 in @entity95			1
like today 's ' skywalkers ' , the men in the photographs balance hundreds of feet up in the air with little or no safety equipment			2
but unlike today 's daredevils , the men photographed in the early decades of the 20th century were n't there out of choice			0
with little attention given to health and safety regulations , the men were expected to climb to the top of some of our most recognisable buildings every day to carry out routine maintenance , cleaning or building work			0
feeling queasy ? photographer @entity116 shuns safety and simply leans over some of @entity25 's tallest skyscrapers to achieve these amazing snaps vertigo - inducing : the 31 - year - old photographer confesses that his photos have made people 's stomach churn in the past daring photographer @entity125 snaps the @entity127 skyline from the top of skyscrapers foolhardy : skywalkers from @entity132 who scale buildings around the country to get the ultimate picture			2

photographs show a steeplejack at the @entity28 performing a handstand on it 's crown high above @entity25
other images show workers on @entity25 's @entity57 building and men fitting lights to @entity89 's @entity94
