by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 are among the names in circulation at @entity8			1
they are the kind of reinforcements @entity12 will need if @entity8 are to challenge once again for the @entity14 title			1
aside from their wage demands , here are the two questions they will be asking of @entity8 ’s chief executive @entity20 : crucial duo : whether @entity8 sign anyone could depend on @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 @entity26 talent : @entity8 have been watching @entity27 midfield pair @entity4 ( left ) and @entity5 the fact that neither question can be answered by @entity12 or @entity30 is hardly a great selling point for one of the biggest clubs in world football			1
without satisfactory answers to either of those questions , it is impossible for a top player to consider signing for @entity8			2
in the last five seasons , @entity24 has scored 85 goals in 137 @entity14 appearances			1
over the same period @entity42 has 90 in 128 in the league			0
if @entity24 and @entity42 are not in the team , then @entity8 can not hope to win a competitive @entity14 , let alone the @entity45			1
let ’s be honest , @entity1 and @entity2 - who played in @entity48 ’s midfield in last season 's @entity45 final - wo n’t fancy threading balls into the path of @entity52			1
decent enough player , but @entity1 and @entity2 , who scored @entity48 ’s equaliser in the final against @entity56 , operate on a different level : inside the @entity59 they rely on @entity60			2
@entity24 and @entity42 are on the same wavelength , elite players who are capable of turning games with a twist of their hips and a finish to match			2
can @entity4 , who left @entity8 for @entity27 in controversial circumstances two years ago , or @entity5 really rely on the fading talents of @entity70 or the inconsistency of @entity72 on either wing ? probably not			1
realistically , this @entity8 team is all about @entity24 and @entity42			1
@entity24 , who earns £ 250,000 a week , is coming up 10 years as a @entity8 player			1
his future at @entity77 is far from certain			0
there is nothing scheduled to discuss terms on a revised contract that will expire in less than 18 months			0
@entity48 duo : @entity1 and @entity2 ( below ) are also on @entity12 's radar since the interest from @entity86 last summer , there has been nothing to suggest that @entity24 will commit his long - term future to @entity8			1
it is still possible that the @entity8 forward , who has been in @entity91 with his family recovering from injury , will leave in the summer			2
there is , of course , an argument that @entity8 must cash in at the end of the season to prevent him walking away on a free transfer in the june 2015			2
the practicality is that @entity8 wrote off his transfer valuation five years after he was signed from @entity104 for 2004			2
anything they get from here is a bonus			0
to meet accounting standards , the £ 28m @entity8 paid for him was amortised between 2004 , when he left @entity110 , and 2009			0
so , anything @entity8 get for @entity24 from here is good business because his transfer fee from @entity104 was effectively written off five years ago			1
left back on the agenda : @entity3 , here training with @entity118 , is a long - term @entity8 target @entity24 is one issue for incoming players and @entity42 , especially his continued absence from the @entity8 team , is another			1
we have been here before with @entity42 when he was at @entity125 , when injuries disrupted the early periods of his career in north @entity129			0
he has only played two full seasons in the @entity14 since his move to @entity132 from @entity133 in the summer of 2004			0
two years ago , when he was elevated to the role of captain at @entity125 , he played in every league game and scored 30 goals			0
@entity138 : @entity24 ( right ) has been @entity8 's best player this season but is yet to sign a new deal hold on to them ! @entity42 ( right ) and @entity24 ( centre ) celebrate the @entity143 's goal against @entity125 last season at @entity8 , when he won the title in his first season at @entity77 , he scored 26 times in 38 @entity14 appearances			1
now he is sidelined with niggling injuries and no - one , including @entity12 , knows when he will return			0
@entity42 , who is captain of the @entity151 team who will be appearing at the @entity153 in @entity154 this summer , has not played since december 10			0
his last goal was against @entity125 , the winner at @entity77 on novemer 10 after 27 minutes			0
watching brief : @entity12 ran the rule over @entity4 and @entity5 in @entity27 's weekend match at @entity159 this may be unfounded , but it does n’t feel as though he has the same appetite for the game now that he finally has a @entity14 medal			1
for someone struggling with groin and toe injuries , he has been out of the game for a long time			0
his return date is unspecified			0
@entity170 and @entity24 are the two players that can make a difference when it comes to lifting silverware at the end of a season			0
without them , @entity8 simply do n't have the same appeal .			2

@entity8 need to decide on @entity24 's future now
without him and @entity23 they wo n't be in the @entity14 race
@entity1 and @entity4 may not be interested if they leave @entity8
it could be best for the club to cash in on @entity24 as soon as possible
