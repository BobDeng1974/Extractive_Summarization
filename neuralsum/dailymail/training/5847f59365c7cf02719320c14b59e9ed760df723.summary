by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 19:02 est , 10 january 2013 for @entity1 and her boyfriend @entity6 , their trip to the @entity5 basin was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime			1
and it has been just that - but for all the wrong reasons			0
the couple , from @entity12 , are now stranded in @entity13 and are not allowed to return home after contracting a rare flesh - eating parasite			1
@entity1 and her boyfriend @entity6 are stranded in @entity13 , unable to return home due to contracting a rare flesh - eating parasite after suffering from irritated skin , they initially thought they were simply suffering from mosquito bites - a standard occurrence in that part of the world			1
but then , to their horror , both @entity27 and @entity6 started to feel something squirming under their skin and occasionally poking its head out of some of the open wounds			1
it was then they were diagnosed with the human bot fly infection , according to @entity37			2
while their wounds probably did start as mosquito bites , the theory is the insects were carrying bot fly eggs			1
these dropped into the wounds caused by the mosquito bites before the larvae then hatched under the skin			1
fly larvae had been living under their skin , feeding on their flesh			1
the maggots eventually crawl out of the host body and become large densely haired bot flies that resemble bees the couple , who live in @entity58 , are now stranded in @entity13 until they are free of the parasites			1
it 's thought that up to 50 eggs could be living in each wound			0
fly larvae had been living under their skin , feeding on their flesh			1
the maggots eventually crawl out of the host body and become large densely haired bot flies that resemble bumblebees			2
' i lifted my shirt to see the head of it crawling at the top of my skin looking like a worm or fishing bait , '' mr @entity6 told the newspaper			1
the newspaper reports that they have already pulled seven of the worm - like larvae from wounds on their stomach , back and legs			0
mr @entity6 is also said to have spent days with tape over his stomach wound , a method used to starve the larvae of air and draw them to the surface			1
during another attempt to remove the parasites his friend pulled out three of the inch - long larvae			0
he said : ' we all nearly puked			0
' the pair may also need minor surgery to remove the remaining parasites			0
the couple hope to return to @entity12 in mid to late february but must remain in @entity13 until at least next month when they expect to be fully healed			1
ordeal : the couple must remain in @entity13 until at least next month when they expect to be fully healed a female bot fly captures a mosquito and attaches its eggs to its body before releasing it			1
the mosquito then carries the eggs and when it bites an animal 's skin , will drop the eggs and they burrow under the skin 's surface			2
they stay just below the surface to breathe , and the most common treatment is to cut off their air supply with vaseline - so they will crawl out			0
untreated , they can burrow too far down and need to be cut out before they develop into flies			0
contracting the condition is highly unlikely , and the only reported cases are from tropical areas , mainly @entity132 and @entity133			0
dr @entity134 of the @entity135 of @entity136 said : ' it can occur in anyone			0
a mosquito drops the bot fly 's eggs onto the skin			2
the bot fly does n't come into contact with the person , the mosquito does it , as a third party			2
' the pupae then burrow under the skin - often the scalp , legs or groin area - and feed off it , but stay close to the surface so they can breathe			0
' flies can also lay their eggs on clothing hanging out to dry , so we recommend ironing it beforehand , if you 're staying in a tropical area			0
' they would have been growing bigger under this man 's skin , which makes it very painful			0
after a couple of weeks they develop into flies , and are moving around - which is very unpleasant			2
but luckily it can be successfully treated			0

@entity1 and boyfriend @entity6 got mosquito bites on @entity5 trip
fly larvae *penetrated* bites to live under their skin , feeding on their flesh
parasite could hatch into maggots and crawl out of their skin within weeks
@entity12 couple stranded in @entity13 until they are free of the parasite
