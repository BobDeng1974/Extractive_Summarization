more than one million immigrants will have the right to vote in the general election - despite not being @entity4 citizens			2
new arrivals from @entity7 countries - including @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 - automatically acquire voting rights on arrival in the @entity4 even if they are only staying for a short time			1
research by the @entity17 campaign group estimates that by the time of the 2015 poll , more than one million @entity7 citizens will be allowed to vote despite not having a @entity4 passport			1
political influence : more than one million immigrants will have the right to vote in the @entity2 despite not being @entity4 citizens , according to research by the think tank @entity17 even a student on a six month visa has exactly the same voting rights as long - term residents , as long as they have an address , the research shows			1
by contrast , the countries where they come from do not offer the same rights to @entity4 living there			1
sir @entity36 , the group ’s chairman , said the rules were an ‘ anachronism ’ from the days of @entity40 and should be scrapped			0
he warned they could have a significant impact on the result of the election			2
sir @entity36 said : ‘ if the next election is close , and especially if there is a coalition negotiation , the number of seats gained by each party will be critical , so the outcome could be significantly influenced by a group of people who have not yet qualified to become @entity4 citizens or have not even bothered to do so			1
' absurd ' : sir @entity36 , the chairman of @entity17 , said the rules were an ' anachronism ' from the days of @entity40 and should be scrapped ‘ one example is that a student visitor from a @entity7 country planning to study for six months would be allowed to enrol on the electoral register and vote in a parliamentary election if one was held during the duration of his or her stay			1
’ ‘ this is clearly absurd			0
the issue is one of basic fairness			0
if people want to participate in deciding the future of our country they should at least become citizens			0
’ official figures suggest that in 2011 there were 960,000 @entity7 citizens living in @entity78 and @entity79			2
they include 266,000 @entity10 nationals , 130,000 @entity11 nationals , more than 51,000 @entity82 , 60,000 @entity8 , 51,000 @entity9 and 37,000 @entity83			0
there are also tens of thousands from @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
apart from a few @entity90 states , @entity4 citizens do not have similar rights in @entity7 countries			1
if the turnout is close to the national average , this could amount to more than half a million votes from non-citizens			2
in 2007 a review by the then attorney general , @entity99 , called for the rules to be scrapped , and for the government to make a ‘ clear connection between citizenship and the right to vote ’			0
the review concluded ‘ ultimately , it is right in principle not to give the right to vote to citizens of other countries living in the @entity4 until they become @entity4 citizens			0
’ however , its conclusions were never acted upon			0
sir @entity36 said : ‘ the public will be astonished to learn that nearly a million foreign citizens from countries that do not allow @entity4 residents to vote in their countries are , nevertheless , allowed to vote in all @entity4 elections			2
‘ this is a hangover from the days of @entity40 and should not have been allowed to continue , especially given the rapid increase in immigration from @entity7 countries			1

new arrivals from the @entity7 automatically acquire voting rights
but the countries they come from do not have *reciprocal* *arrangements*
a close election could be significantly influenced by foreign voters
