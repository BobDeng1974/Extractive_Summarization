@entity0 pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining @entity5 , and not the @entity6 , at the end			1
the segment was laid out the same as the recent @entity10 spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his @entity14			1
the spot that first aired during the @entity15 and was seen as a touching look at what it is like to say goodbye for those that have family members in the service			0
in this version however , the father , played by @entity25 , dropped off his daughter , played by @entity28 , and as he tearfully said goodbye she says to him ; ' @entity10 , it 's just @entity5			1
' when the father then says to take care of his girl , one of the men yells ; ' death to @entity54			1
' then , as the commercial ended , a message appeared on screen ; ' @entity5 , we 'll take it from here , @entity10			2
' @entity28 winked at her father to assure him everything was all right in the parody some on twitter found the parody ' depraved ' others on twitter found the bit ' hysterical ' @entity28 teels her father not to worry saying , ' @entity10 , it 's just @entity5 ' this all comes on the same week three men were arrested in the @entity54 with ties to the terrorist organization and three female @entity76 teenagers left to join the group			1
the skit was met with outrage by many on @entity81 , who took the program to task for being insensitive			0
' ca n't be serious			0
@entity86 skit ? like going to college ? when so many people are being kidnapped and killed ? depraved , ' wrote @entity89			0
' apparently @entity90 and @entity0 thought it was funny to have a skit showing @entity5 driving to an airport to pick up an @entity54 girl			1
@entity94 ! , ' said @entity95			0
others however found the skit ' hilarious			0
' this also comes the same week that the identity of @entity5 member @entity99 was revealed and the group destroyed a collection of priceless statues and sculptures in @entity104 dating back thousands of years in @entity105			2
@entity99 is @entity76 citizen @entity106 , the man who is responsible for the high - profile beheadings of @entity54 @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 as well as @entity76 citizens @entity111 and @entity113 in the name of the terrorist organization			2
his identity was previously unknown as he always wears a mask			0
@entity118 this week also said that they believe four missing teenagers may have traveled to be in @entity5 .			2

@entity0 made a parody of a @entity14 commercial in which a young girl is driven to the airport by her father to head off to the army
in the *snl* version the young girl , played by host @entity28 , hops on a truck with members of @entity5 and an @entity45 flag on the side
she tells her father , ' @entity10 , it 's just @entity5 , ' as she walks away , and then as she drives off a man yells ' death to @entity54 ! '
many on *social* media were outraged , calling the show ' depraved , ' while others found it ' hilarious '
this comes the same week that three @entity76 girls and four @entity118 , all teenagers , are believed to have run off to join @entity5
