home secretary @entity0 has persuaded the countries to campaign with @entity2 for tighter restrictions on migrants ’ access to handouts and other services			1
last night , the countries sent a joint letter to the @entity37 , arguing that the free movement directive – a founding principle of the @entity10 – must not be ‘ unconditional ’			1
the letter , which calls for action at a meeting of the @entity10 ’s justice and home affairs council in june , warns that some towns and cities ‘ are under a considerable strain by certain immigrants from other member states ’			2
it adds : ‘ these immigrants avail themselves of the opportunities that freedom of movement provides , without , however , fulfilling the requirements for exercising this right			0
' this type of immigration burdens the host societies with considerable additional costs , in particular caused by the provision of schooling , health care and adequate accommodation			0
’ the four countries also want to make it harder for citizens of other member states to gain access to benefits within days or weeks of arriving in a member state			1
@entity2 has long sought changes to the rules on entitlement to welfare but its chances of success were limited while it remained a lone voice in @entity78			2
that @entity14 , in particular , has joined the campaign will place huge pressure on other member states to come to an agreement on tightening the rules			0
the letter was sent to @entity85 , president of the justice and home affairs council , and was signed by mrs may , @entity89 , @entity18 ’s federal minister of the interior ; dr @entity90 , @entity14 ’s federal minister of the interior , and @entity92 , minister for immigration in @entity19			1
the free movement directive says that all 500million citizens of the @entity10 should be free to enter any member state , with only the most minor of border controls			1
last night , the countries sent a joint letter to the @entity37 , arguing that the free movement directive must not be ' unconditional '			2
it was sent to @entity85 , president of the justice and home affairs council but the letter says that abuse of the directive is having a negative effect on some states with its burden on benefits , schools and healthcare			2
it continues : ‘ on top of this strain on vital local services , a significant number of new immigrants draw social assistance in the host countries , frequently without a genuine entitlement , burdening the host countries ’ social welfare systems			0
’ the letter added that the signatories wanted to stop migrants ‘ who have only recently arrived in a member state and have never been employed or paid taxes there to claim the same social security benefits as that of member state ’s own citizens ’			0
they also want a crackdown on migrants from outside the @entity10 who marry an @entity10 citizen in order to gain access to state handouts			1
the letter states : ‘ all necessary measures need to be taken to deal with the consequences of this type of immigration and to fight its causes			0
this includes legal as well as financial measures			0
’ last month , @entity152 said he was determined to end @entity2 ’s ‘ soft touch ’ reputation on immigration and welfare			2
from next year , arrivals from the @entity10 will be stripped of jobseekers ’ benefits after six months unless they can prove they have been actively looking for a job and stand a ‘ genuine chance ’ of finding one			1
a @entity164 frontbencher was accused of being ‘ xenophobic ’ after saying ‘ it would be nice to see a @entity2 hotel receptionist ’			0
while discussing immigration , @entity168 said many employers ‘ do not bother ’ hiring @entity2 , leaving locals in his @entity173 constituency feeling ‘ undercut ’			0
@entity175 mp @entity174 said : ‘ @entity164 have gone from an ‘ open - door ’ policy to cynically peddling xenophobic rhetoric			0
’ last night mr @entity168 said : ‘ i made no anti-immigrant comments ... the [ hospitality ] industry has failed to train and upskill local workforce			0
