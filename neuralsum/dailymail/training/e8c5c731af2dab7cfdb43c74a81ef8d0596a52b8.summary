by @entity1 reporter published : 19:17 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 21:17 est , 29 october 2012 mps warned last night that @entity4 hospitals could go bust as a result of @entity9 ’s botched @entity8 deals			1
many trusts ’ chances of breaking even were being undermined by ‘ unaffordable ’ contracts with private sector companies under the much - derided private finance initiative , the @entity10 said			1
but members also criticised the present government for having no idea how to respond if a trust does go bankrupt and is forced to close down – saying the controversial reforms imposed on the @entity4 could make things worse			1
former health secretary @entity22 put @entity23 in the failure regime - the trust was losing more than £ 1 million per week they said it appeared the @entity28 was ‘ inventing rules and processes on the hoof ’ to deal with hospital trusts which get into financial difficulties			1
it raises the possibility of communities being left without vital services because managers at their local trust have not been able to keep the organisation solvent			1
at least 22 trusts , running 60 units , are facing severe problems as a result of @entity8 burdens , and earlier this year the @entity46 had to put in £ 1.5billion to bail them out			1
but the @entity49 ’s reforms will devolve the vast majority of the @entity4 budget to @entity52 , meaning there will be less available for the central department to prop up failing trusts			1
the committee said ministers had done nothing to establish a robust protocol for action should a hospital go bust			2
chairman @entity63 said ministers were unable to provide mps with reassurance that financial problems will not damage the quality of care or access experienced by patients of troubled trusts , at a time when the service is already struggling to find £ 20billion - worth of cuts			2
although @entity4 bodies reported an overall surplus of £ 2.1billion in 2011 - 12 , the apparently healthy financial picture masked a ‘ significant minority ’ of bodies which are in difficulties , said the report			0
ten @entity4 trusts , 21 foundation trusts and three primary care trusts reported a combined deficit of £ 356million , £ 115million of which was accounted for by two @entity89 trusts , one of which was put into special administration in july			2
@entity10 chairman @entity63 said ministers were unable to provide reassurance to mps that financial problems within @entity4 trusts would not damage care quality a further 31 struggling @entity4 trusts and 11 foundation trusts may not have broken even if they had not been bailed out with cash injections worth £ 1.1billion from the department and other @entity4 organisations , said the report			1
during the committee ’s inquiry into the future financial sustainability of the @entity4 , the department was unable to explain clearly how the ‘ failure regime ’ would work under the new arrangements , or what circumstances would trigger it being applied to a struggling hospital			0
' ensuring a viable financial future for healthcare providers is vital if the public are to have confidence in the delivery of their local services , ' said the report			0
' yet we still do not have critical details of how the new system introduced by the @entity4 reforms will work so that services remain available to patients in their locality			2
' mrs @entity63 said : ' the @entity28 could not explain to us how it will deal with an @entity4 trust that goes bankrupt			2
nor could it provide reassurance that financial problems would not damage the quality of care or equality of access to all citizens , wherever they live			0
she added : ' we are particularly concerned that the financial viability of a number of trusts is being undermined by the fact that they are locked into unaffordable @entity8 contracts			1
' it is unclear how the department will continue to underwrite payments once most of the money moves to the @entity149			0
’ the @entity95 ’ warning came on the day that administrators of an @entity4 trust on the brink of bankruptcy said it should be dissolved , with the possibility that one of its hospitals will be run by a private company			1
the @entity89 @entity4 trust was losing more than £ 1million a week			0
special administrator @entity159 said a nearby @entity161 department should close down and the princess royal hospital in @entity163 , near @entity164 , should be taken over by another provider			0
former health secretary @entity22 put the trust in the failure regime after it emerged that it ran up deficits of more than £ 150million over the past three years			0
sources close to mr @entity22 said long - standing difficulties had been made worse by two @entity8 deals which are now costing £ 61million a year in interest			0
mr @entity159 said @entity8 debts accounted for ‘ around a third ’ of the trust ’s £ 65million overspend in the last financial year .			0
