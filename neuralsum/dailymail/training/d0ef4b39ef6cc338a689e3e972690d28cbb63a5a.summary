he has travelled to some of the most glamorous locations in the world and lives in a palace but prince @entity5 looked surprisingly at home as he descended into @entity8 's deepest sewer			1
wearing a hard hat and a bright orange high - viz jacket over his pinstriped grey suit , @entity5 was on inquisitive form and peppered his hosts from @entity14 with questions as he went			2
luckily for the heir to the throne , the @entity16 is brand new and wo n't be connected to the capital 's pipes until december 2015			2
futuristic : the @entity5 was 75m below the surface of @entity8 today , as he visited the @entity16 when it is , the tunnel , dubbed a ' super sewer ' by @entity8 mayor @entity25 , will have the capacity to carry up to 16 million tonnes of waste at any one time			1
@entity5 was joined for his visit by a group of engineers , all of whom were among the team that helped to construct it			0
he also met apprentices @entity37 , 19 , and @entity39 , 23 , during his tour and spent several minutes chatting to them			0
a supporter of apprenticeship schemes , the @entity5 has spoken in the past of the importance of giving young people hands - on experience and the chance of a career in engineering			2
' apprentices and young people have a key part to play in our future , ' said @entity14 ceo @entity56 after the visit			0
enjoying himself : @entity5 toured the ' super-sewer ' with apprentices @entity37 , 19 , and @entity39 , 23 impressive : the enormous tunnel is 7km long , seven metres wide and cost £ 635m to complete fascinated : the @entity5 peppered the engineers accompanying him on the tour with questions ' bringing in new talent now is crucial as we need an army of operational staff ready to take over from those who will inevitably retire in years to come			1
' the vast tunnel , which was commissioned to put an end to leakage from @entity8 's creaking @entity73 sewer system , sits 75m below ground , runs for seven kilometres and cost £ 635m to build			1
although not currently on - line , the @entity75 , which sits next to the @entity16 , is and was processing thousands of tonnes of waste as the @entity5 was shown around			1
despite the thousands of tonnes of sewage travelling through its pipes , the building was surprisingly free from bad smells , leaving @entity5 free to admire its ornate interior			0
built as part of @entity8 's original sewerage system , the building was designed by sir @entity87 and played a key role in helping to rid the capital of diseases such as cholera			1
the @entity73 system , which was opened by @entity5 ' great - great - grandfather @entity93 while he was still @entity5 , is celebrating its 150th birthday this year			1
not his usual look : @entity5 donned a hard hat , high - viz jacket and a pair of goggles during the tour overflow : currently , 39m tonnes of waste are leaking into the @entity103 from @entity8 's overworked sewers visit : @entity5 was shown around the @entity75 by @entity14 's @entity56 ( right ) still going strong : @entity75 was built in 1865 by sir @entity87 but is still in use opened in 1865 , it replaced the old habit of dumping rubbish and faeces directly into the @entity103 - behaviour that famously resulted in the @entity111 of 1858			1
so revolting was the smell emanating from the @entity103 , even @entity112 was affected , with prime minister @entity114 describing the river as ' a @entity117 pool , reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors '			0
the disgusting stench that summer did prove to have some benefits , however ; the main one being the speedy agreement of mps to sir @entity87 's sewer plans			0
part of them was @entity75 , where @entity5 , watched by @entity14 workers and staff from sanitation charity , water aid , unveiled a plaque			2
stench : the pumping station was built in the wake of the @entity111 which blighted @entity8 in 1858 all smiles : @entity5 was following in the footsteps of @entity93 who opened @entity75 in 1865 beautiful : the pumping station is famous for its beautiful architecture and ornate interior reception : at the end of the tour , @entity5 attended a reception , during which he unveiled a plaque ' we can often take our own access to safe water and sanitation for granted , ' added mr @entity56			1
' the focus on our history really reminds us that a time when we too did n’t have the basic human requirements our taps and toilets provide is n’t that long ago			0
' anyone living in @entity8 today owes sir @entity87 a great debt of gratitude			0
' prince @entity5 has been the president of water aid since 1991			0
speaking after the @entity5 's visit , @entity162 , deputy chairman of @entity163 said : ' despite our joint achievements , today - astonishingly – 748 million people still do n't have access to safe water and 2.5 million still live without access to somewhere safe and private to go to the toilet			2
' tragically , this causes the easily preventable death of a young child every single minute			0

the @entity5 toured the @entity16 , @entity8 's deepest sewer

it is part of @entity8 's original sewerage system which is now 150 years old
that was opened by then @entity5 @entity93 in 1865
