by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 wants to finish his career in @entity3 out of respect for @entity6 ’s fans after confirming that he has played his last game for them			1
although @entity1 could stay in the @entity9 , he wants to move away from @entity10 after failing to agree a new deal at @entity12			0
@entity13 , who finished eighth in @entity16 last season , are among a number of clubs interested in the former @entity10 left back , including @entity20 , who who could offer him a massive tax - free contract			1
saying goodbye : @entity1 will look for a move abroad after leaving @entity6 at the end of the season respect : the left back feels too close to the @entity6 fans to move to one of their rivals interest : @entity13 and @entity20 are two possible destinations for @entity1 @entity1 ’s £ 130,000 - a - week deal at @entity6 has come to an end and he is available on a free transfer			1
a move to @entity39 , where former @entity6 manager @entity40 is preparing for the @entity42 final , was @entity1 ’s preferred option but it appears his chances have receded after it emerged that @entity46 left back @entity47 and @entity49 defender @entity48 will stay next season			1
at 33 @entity1 wants first - team football next season and he will decide his future when he returns from his summer holiday			0
@entity54 , who are desperate for a left - sided defender , would take him and @entity58 manager @entity57 said in december he would be prepared to see @entity1 return to the club , but the former @entity10 left back , who quit international football when he was overlooked for the @entity64 squad in @entity46 , does not want to join one of @entity6 ’s rivals			1
@entity67 made in heaven : @entity1 joined @entity6 and @entity69 from @entity58 in 2006 strain : but @entity69 has n't been able to stop @entity1 from smoking , which he actively despises now a blue : @entity1 celebrates with his @entity6 team - mates after a goal against former club @entity58 @entity1 left @entity58 in 2006 to join @entity69 ’s side , but his relationship with @entity6 ’s manager has become complicated			1
@entity69 actively despises smoking and has never been able to convince the defender to quit the habit			1
@entity1 ’s standing at the club was also affected by his decision to continue with his @entity86 party the night after @entity6 ’s @entity88 defeat at @entity89			2
@entity69 called @entity6 ’s players and urged them to reconsider their plans for a central @entity93 dinner after that unexpected defeat at the @entity95			0
although most players heeded the warning and turned back , @entity1 carried on regardless and was later spotted partying with @entity58 players			2
after an appearance against @entity100 on january 26 , @entity1 then spent 18 games on the sidelines			0
when @entity6 lost at @entity103 , he told those sitting near him in the directors ’ box that he would be leaving in the summer			0
he made a brief return to the @entity6 team at the end of the season when @entity69 picked him for the @entity42 tie at @entity112			0
he remained in the team for the victory at @entity114 and was also picked to play in the @entity42 semi-final second leg defeat at @entity12 against @entity112			0
in @entity6 ’s final home game of the season , against @entity118 at @entity12 , @entity1 left the field in tears			2
it was then he realised he had played his last home game for the club , although he did play in the victory at @entity124 on the last day of the season			0
respect : the @entity6 players watch on as @entity1 claps his fans for the last time against @entity129 tearful at @entity12 : @entity1 has barely featured this season due to @entity132 's form			2

@entity1 does n't want to move to one of @entity6 's rivals
@entity58 and @entity54 interested in the left back
@entity13 and @entity20 lead @entity140 chase
@entity1 wanted @entity39 move , but they have enough cover
@entity69 actively despises smoking , which @entity1 would n't stop
