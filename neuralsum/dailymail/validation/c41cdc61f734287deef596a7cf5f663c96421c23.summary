as part of a class assignment , inmates at @entity2 's oldest prison were tasked with writing their own obituaries - and the results were as startling as they were moving			1
the idea was that of @entity9 journalism professor @entity8 , who teaches a news writing class at @entity11 , just north of @entity12			1
' i did it as a way to find out how these guys had reconciled their crimes , ' @entity8 told the @entity18			1
' were they able to take a critical look at what got them in trouble ? ' @entity24 his ending : convicted murderer @entity26 sits against a fence in the exercise yard at @entity11 in @entity2			1
he is one of several inmateswho wrote his own obituary for a class project repenting : you wrote in his obituary that , after killing someone , he would like save someone before he dies @entity36 refugee @entity26 came to @entity37 when he was five - years - old			1
as a teenager he fell into the wrong crowd , blaming cultural differences , and soon joined an @entity42 gang			1
when he was about 20 , you got into a fight outside a high school with a member of a @entity47 gang			1
reeling from the fight , you went and got a gun , and set about trying to find his rivals from the fight			2
failing that , he opened fire at a random person on the street			2
' it was just a guy who looked like a gang member , ' you told @entity57			2
' he was close enough			2
' he killed the 17 - year - old boy , and bystanders were hit by bullets as well			2
you was convicted of murder and attempted murder in 1996 and could spend the rest of his life behind bars			2
professor @entity8 told the inmates they could make up anything they wanted for their obituary and gave them free creative reign			1
most importantly they had to figure out how they would die			2
you wrote a story about a riot breaking out in @entity11 and how he saves the life of a teacher by stepping in front of a knife			1
he is stabbed to death by another inmate			2
you said , having killed someone himself , you would like to one day save someone			0
' my incarceration , the reason i 'm here , is by taking a life			0
when i leave this world , i would love to leave saving a life , ' he said			0
reflective : @entity11 inmate @entity92 , also a convicted murderer , made no mention of his crimes , instead writing that he is killed in an earthquake @entity92 is serving 31 years to life for first - degree murder , arson , burglary and grand theft			1
a charismatic and expressive @entity103 jew , @entity92 has discovered a love for acting while behind bars , and has appeared in a prison production of @entity108 's @entity107			0
his obituary makes no reference of his crimes			0
he paints a story of himself of being outdoorsy and enjoying camping and mountain climbing trips with his friend			0
@entity92 died ' as a result of a massive earthquake that struck @entity11 ' , his obituary said			1
they 're forces of nature , ' @entity92 told @entity57			0
' to take me out , it would take something like that			0
' emotional : @entity124 is serving a 70 - years - to - life sentence for armed robbery , carjacking and false imprisonment at @entity11 @entity129 , who is serving 55 years for a string of bank robberies , also did not mention his crimes			1
he skips over his death in the obituary , saying he was found dead in his cell on his 55th birthday from natural causes			0
but he goes on to reminisce about his childhood and the stages in his life that were positive - where things could have been different			0
@entity129 includes his piece ' quotes ' from a classmate about how proactive a student he was in @entity146 , including being class president			1
' he built the treasury from just a couple of dollars , to several thousand , ' the quote said			0
' his biggest accomplishment was at @entity154 , our float was the biggest one , and our @entity156 was held at a big fancy hotel			0
the seniors were somewhat jealous			0
' @entity129 later told @entity57 that he was thinking about the time when he was ' on track '			0
' once i got derailed , that was it , ' he said			0
