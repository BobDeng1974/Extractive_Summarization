it has been widely accepted @entity1 ’s rumoured 5.5 - inch @entity2 will not launch later this year - but the delay was previously blamed on manufacturing problems			1
the latest reports , however , are blaming this staggered release date on @entity1 ’s marketing strategy , and suggest the tech giant is feeling vulnerable against rivals such as @entity10 and @entity11			1
tech site @entity12 claims @entity1 will look to maximise sales of its next range of @entity16 by releasing them in stages			2
this was blamed on manufacturing problems			2
the latest reports , instead , are blaming this staggered release date on @entity1 's marketing strategy the @entity2 maker reported sales of $ 37.4 billion ( £ 21.9 billion ) in its third quarter ending june , falling short of expectations for about $ 38 billion ( £ 22.3 billion )			1
sales of @entity30 hit 13.3 million , which is a little short of analysts ' projections of more than 14 million			0
gross margin , however , was better than expected at 39.4 per cent , up from 36.9 per cent a year ago			0
despite poor @entity30 sales , the @entity2 continued to do well with 35.2 million handsets sold in the past three months – an increase of 13 per cent following strong performance in @entity39			2
@entity41 desktop computers were the most popular product by the group in terms of growth , with 4.4 million sold , providing a year - on - year increased of 18 per cent			2
overall , the company ’s quarterly profit rose 12 per cent to $ 7.75 billion ( £ 4.55 billion )			0
this is so the devices do n’t go head - to - head in the same way the @entity52 and @entity53 did last year			0
sources ‘ familiar with the matter ’ told @entity12 : ‘ the different timetables have been set as @entity1 does not want to repeat the mistake it made in 2013 when it launched the @entity52 and @entity53 simultaneously			0
’ but @entity1 expert @entity58 from @entity59 dubbed these reports as ' spurious ' : ‘ @entity1 ’s @entity2 sales numbers in no way suggest it made a ‘ mistake ’ in launching the @entity52 and @entity53 simultaneously			1
’ he continued that although there is evidence that the balance of sales between the two devices differed , in favour of the @entity52 , this may be because people preferred to buy the more expensive model			0
his claims are also bolstered by the fact @entity1 sold 35.2 million @entity2 handsets in the past three months – an increase of 13 per cent following strong performance in @entity39			2
this was despite a nine per cent slump in @entity30 sales			0
the initial reports about the delay blamed it on issues with manufacturing the glass and case needed for the larger screens			1
sources ' familiar with the matter ' said : ' the different timetables have been set as @entity1 does not want to repeat the mistake it made in 2013 when it launched the @entity52 ( pictured front ) and @entity53 ( pictured back ) simultaneously ' but @entity1 site @entity59 questioned the reports : ' @entity1 's @entity2 sales numbers in no way suggest it made a ' mistake ' in launching the @entity52 and @entity53 ( pictured ) simultaneously			2
' this is bolstered by @entity1 figures that show it sold 35.2 million @entity2 handsets in the past three months - up 13 % @entity1 has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens , and its devices typically have a 4 - inch display			1
@entity1 's larger screens are expected to use in - cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal display			0
current models have a separate touchscreen layer			0
elsewhere , the 5.5 - inch @entity2 screen is expected to be made of sapphire crystal , rather than glass			1
due to the complex nature of these screens , reports claim @entity1 could even ask component makers to prepare for 120 million displays , to account for any faults and replacements that need to be issued			1
suppliers claim @entity1 has ordered between 70 and 80 million units combined for its rumoured , upcoming 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch @entity2 6s ( leaked images pictured ) by 30 december			1
the reports come after @entity2 maker @entity121 confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the gadgets this report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger ' phablet ' sized @entity2 6 wo n't ship until 2015			0
meanwhile , a separate report claimed the tech giant is said to be so confident its upcoming @entity128 will be a success , it has ordered 80 million handsets by the end of the year			0
if true , this would be the largest initial production run of @entity16 – up from 60 million for the @entity52 and @entity53 last year			0
this suggests either @entity1 will release two handsets by the end of the year , or is expecting the 4.7 - inch model to be a third more popular than its previous handsets combined			1
suppliers claimed the @entity138 firm has asked for between 70 and 80 million units combined for the rumoured 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch @entity2 6s by 30 december .			1

reports last week suggest @entity1 will release its two models separately
the 4.7 - inch is due to debut in september , followed by the 5.5 - inch in 2015
this was blamed on problems with manufacturing the glass and case
latest reports , instead , blame it on @entity1 ’s marketing strategy

@entity1 recently *announced* it sold 32.5 million *iphones* in the last quarter
