when @entity1 and @entity2 embraced , yielding perhaps the most famous of all images of sportsmanship on a football pitch , the final whistle had already blown			0
that was in 1970 , at the end of a wonderfully hard - fought @entity9 group match between @entity10 and @entity11 , which the @entity12 won 1 - 0			0
so loudly did the football world applaud such an exhibition of mutual respect between two giants of the game that all these decades later , the applause still resounds			2
that image of them is frequently flourished as a perfect example of what the game was , and is used to compare , unfavourably , with what it has become			0
@entity26 keeper @entity25 congratulated @entity28 striker @entity27 on his goal at half - time @entity2 's famous hug with @entity1 in 1970 is often held up as the peak of sportsmanship and so the @entity34 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity25 and @entity27 are lesser stars than @entity2 and @entity1 , of course , and the @entity26 goalkeeper ’s instinctively friendly gesture towards the man who had just scored a brilliant goal past him took place with 45 minutes yet to play			1
but was it really so different to that celebrated business in @entity44 , @entity45 , for which we do n’t only continue to congratulate the @entity10 colossus and the @entity49 legend for their integrity and values , but also ourselves , somehow , for knowing and loving the game when it still had a place for common decency ? @entity57 ’s @entity56 , among many others , has lambasted @entity25 for an inappropriate show of brotherhood towards a fellow professional			1
on @entity63 , @entity62 agreed			0
the @entity65 , they say , was out of order			0
the implication is that , as he walked off the pitch at half - time , he should have been so lost in his own despair , or anger , or disappointment , or fierce resolve to get back on terms , that if he ’d noticed @entity27 at all , the only acceptable form of communication should have been a muttered oath , or at best a hard stare			1
@entity25 smiles at @entity27 shortly after the striker 's goal gave the @entity28 the lead in the @entity83 derby @entity57 's @entity56 criticised @entity25 for his half - time actions while speaking on @entity85 any form of friendliness could at the very least have waited until after the game was over , they reckon			1
meanwhile , for some of @entity25 ’s critics on social media , the fact that it was an intense local derby puts his behaviour almost beyond the pale			2
has football really become so leeched of humanity that one decent pro ca n’t turn to another and say ‘ well played ’ ? nobody thinks that @entity25 would have complimented his opponent had it been a scuffed shot through his legs from two yards			1
but it was a wondrous strike , and , derby or not , half - time or not , a game that has no room either for an acknowledgment of a great piece of technique , or for a simple , impulsive act of sportsmanship , is a game that has become entirely detached from its roots			2
@entity27 ( left ) hit a stunning volley on the cusp of half - time to give @entity28 the lead against @entity26 @entity27 celebrates his strike which helped the @entity28 to victory in the @entity83 derby others insist otherwise , saying only someone with ‘ no passion ’ for football could commend @entity25 for doing what he did			1
i am a passionate @entity131 and naturally i have asked myself how i ’d feel if , let ’s say , @entity133 congratulated @entity135 captain @entity134 in the tunnel after just being beaten by him , stupendously , from 30 yards			0
would i consider it disrespectful to shell - shocked fans ? or assume that by so publicly fraternising with the ‘ enemy ’ , @entity133 was n’t quite up for what remained of the fight ? of course not			0
on the contrary , i ’d be pleased to have a grown - up on my team			0
moreover , there is another dimension to all this			0
the sub-text in at least some of the excoriation of @entity25 ’s back - slapping is that he is one of the @entity153 ’s foreign imports , and either does n’t fully understand the ferocious tribalism that flavours the @entity155 , or being a highly - paid mercenary , chooses not to inhale it			2
@entity26 came up short against their rivals yet again , but @entity25 's gesture was not the problem @entity27 's strike was a goal worthy of winning any game , and congratulating him was the decent thing to do but that ’s rubbish , too			1
some of us might have wistfully fond memories of an age when @entity170 football was overwhelmingly populated by players from the @entity172 , but we kid ourselves if we think that the modern domestic game is divided by passports into those who give their all and those who do n’t			0
and yet , let ’s be brutally honest , would the condemnation have been quite so swift and quite so loud if the boot had been on the other foot on sunday , if it had been @entity27 walking down the tunnel at half - time slapping @entity25 on the back for denying him seconds earlier with a truly breathtaking , world - class save ? in fact , would there have been any condemnation at all ? or would it have been held up as a heart - warming example , even in the intense heat of competition , of a typically honest @entity170 footballer doing the decent thing ?			1

@entity26 goalkeeper @entity25 was seen *laughing* at half time
@entity27 had scored a stunning goal past him moments earlier
@entity57 's @entity56 criticised @entity25 for being too friendly
but the keeper was simply showing respect to an opponent
