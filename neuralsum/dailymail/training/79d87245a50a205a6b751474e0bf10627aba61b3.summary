by @entity0 one more defining moment			1
one more glorious performance by a @entity4 athlete who surpassed expectations			1
one more explosion of joyous noise that shook @entity8 to its ancient foundations			1
@entity11 , already a @entity13 champion at the age of 24 , on friday produced an astonishing performance in almost impossible circumstances to claim silver in the women ’s 800 metres			1
after spending three hours on a drip in hospital overnight , @entity11 finished second only to world champion @entity21 in a race that had another sell - out crowd roaring themselves hoarse until the final dip , when the local favourite just managed to pip 20 - year - old @entity28 rising star @entity27			1
emotional : @entity11 holds aloft a @entity4 saltire as she celebrates her silver medal in the women 's 800m arms aloft : @entity11 celebrates her silver medal at the @entity33 as @entity34 ( left ) crouches race : @entity11 ( centre ) fought from the middle of the pack and she trailed @entity39 's @entity34 ( right ) yet the home hero admitted , beset by injuries and illness in a year from hell , admitted that she had been close to withdrawing after a horrendous night			1
‘ last night i went out for dinner because i just thought it was the food in the village i was n’t enjoying , ’ she said , adding : ‘ i order a lovely 20 - quid steak – and i could n’t face it			1
‘ i got back to the village , threw up for a few hours and ( team @entity4 head coach ) @entity49 took me across the clinic			1
‘ i was there til half five this morning on a drop			2
all i ’ve eaten today is porridge and scrambled egg			2
i just came out here to leave everything on the track			1
to have one more obstacle thrown at me was just laughable – i had one shot , two minutes to give it everything			2
‘ at half two last night , i could n’t bend over to take my socks off because the cramps were so bad			2
i was wondering how the hell i could run			2
but somehow , another miracle			2
‘ i slept from half five until nine , then an hour before lunch			2
but i do n’t know how i managed that			2
i ’m just hoping i can enjoy some rubbish food now			2
i ’ve been looking forward to it for days and weeks			2
‘ two things i ’ll never forget			2
one is being on my hands and knees being sick , with the nurse holding my hair back , @entity49 holding my hair back – and four big police officers walking away at the sound of me being sick			2
preparation : @entity11 stretches on the start line before taking part in the women 's 800m final at @entity8 disbelief : @entity11 puts her hands on her head as she realises her achievement at @entity8 ‘ the other thing is being doubled over , trying to take my socks off while @entity90 was sleeping in the room			1
‘ written on my hand is : “ go out strong and commit			0
” the crowd were so intimidating			0
i do n’t mean that to sound bad but yesterday i kind of @entity96 myself on the line			0
so i needed something to take me away from the moment			0
i knew they were here for me			0
‘ it does n’t feel real			0
you all know what i ’ve been through this year – and even this morning has been a nightmare			0
this just means so much to me , given the obstacles i ’ve overcome			0
’ based on what all of the athletes here had done this season , @entity11 went into the race knowing that , depending on whether this was a lung - stretching dash or a tactical plod , her very best might – just might – get her a bronze medal			1
she would certainly have to be somewhere near her peak , though			0
supremely smooth in her first heat , @entity11 struggled woefully in thursday ’s semi-final , falling way off the pace on the back straight and needing an all - out sprint over the closing yards just to pinch fourth place – enough to see her into friday ’s final as one of the fastest losers			1
now , loser is not a term that many people would associate with the girl from @entity134			0
fighter , class act , winner – those are usually the words associated with an athlete who has overcome enormous obstacles just to be here			0
injury and then infection had put qualification in doubt until almost the very last			0
and @entity11 will admit that being almost forgotten during her lengthy absence had acted as a spur			1
at this year ’s @entity147 , she ’d railed against the live track commentators who barely gave her a passing mention – and added this slight to others made by pundits paying lavish tributes to certain rivals for overcoming much less traumatic health issues than @entity11 herself			1
then she went out and beat everyone to claim her second @entity159 title			0
there is a school of thought that says @entity11 simply likes to have someone or something to kick against			1
that she is n’t happy without being written off , under - represented or just plain dissed			1
whatever makes her run fast , right ? she ’d looked decidedly nervous ahead of her semi-final , bouncing on the line and seemingly struggling to maintain her regular focus – she ’s not a waver to fans , a gleeful saluter of well - wisher , more a steely - eyed competitor – amid the deafening cheers prompted by her introduction			1
inspiration : @entity11 started the race with the words ' get out strong ' , ' commit ' written on her hand shattered : @entity11 clutches her chest and sprawls across the track after claiming @entity33 silver on frday night , @entity11 prowled the bend of lane six before the final with a definite intent , pausing only to stretch out those hamstrings one last time			1
fine - tuning the instrument that had enable her to reach such heights			0
with @entity34 and @entity192 outside her , @entity191 rival @entity190 just one lane inside , she ’d at least know exactly what kind of pace was needed right from the off			1
the @entity197 was out quick enough in a race where the world champion clearly decided that pace , pace and more pace was her best hope			0
this would be all about hanging on the train and then timing the final surge right – while hoping to have the legs to last			0
sixth at the bell , she bided her time			0
stayed more restrained than anyone in the crowd			0
she picked her moment to perfection , charging around the final bend and hitting the home straight flying , overtaking a despairing @entity27 just on the line			1
the daughter of former sprint great @entity220 added : ‘ i think i ’d have won it if i ’d been 100 percent			0
if someone had said at half two this morning i ’d have a silver medal i ’d have said : “ yeah , whatever			1
” ‘ @entity224 came to see me in the village earlier this week and jhe gave me a signed picture of him and my dad			0
‘ they look like they ’re holding hands and he put a really nice message on it , saying to stay focused and determined			0
‘ i put it up on my wall in the village above my bed			0
to have people like him here			0
@entity241 said i could nick a medal , it means so much to me			1
‘ i met my mum and sister on the lap of honour , that ’s when i started crying			0
i was able to pick out people i ’d grown up with , peoples parents , my mum ’s friends , people i ’ grown up with			1
‘ this is above everything , the year @entity255 been through i do n’t think anything will ever top that			0
’ competition : @entity192 ( centre ) , @entity34 and @entity261 ( back centre ) race around @entity8			1

@entity11 claimed a second @entity4 silver on the track in two nights on friday
both her parents represented @entity4 at the @entity33
she lived up to her *billing* as one of the home favourites for a medal
@entity34 looked well positioned after 600m but faded in the last 200m
