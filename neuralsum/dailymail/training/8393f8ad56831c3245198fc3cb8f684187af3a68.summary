' 2008 : in an on - air prank actor @entity27 ( left ) was left stunned by the ' joke ' voicemail messages where @entity4 said that @entity3 had slept with his granddaughter @entity34 ( right ) as they were : the pair were colleagues broadcasting on @entity15 before they caused the uproar brand added : ' obviously we regretted it because it became difficult to distinguish the media phenomena from the obvious impolite act			1
' i consider myself quite a polite person right , but sometimes you get excited when you 're doing a joke			0
' i 'm doing the joke , and i think ' this is brilliant , this is brilliant ' and then you sort of realise , ' oh that 's reality with real consequences			0
' i went ' oh it 's only a joke ' - i did n't realise that we were part of the frequency of reality			0
' opening up : the pair discussed the controversial moment in broadcasting for the first time as they pre-recorded @entity4 's latest show ( pictured with other guests ) close friends : the pair caused uproar in 2008 when they took the boundaries too far on their @entity15 show now in the past : the pair had prank called actor @entity27 during the radio show , making ' obscene ' comments about his granddaughter making his entrance : @entity3 and @entity4 both left the @entity15 following the scandal and have now admitted they had lost sight of ' reality ' @entity4 told how the incident had been a bonding experience for the two of them - and had been a ' genuinely nice thing ' which had resulted from the controversy			1
' @entity3 and i went through an unusual experience together and even though we 're both embarrassed by what we did , that 's fair enough - but at the same time , the only genuinely nice thing that came out of it for me was the fact that we became very close , ' he said			1
but @entity3 then ribbed him : ' you said you 'd do it again , let 's call up other treasures of @entity176 comedy			2
let 's find the surviving @entity178 and bang on their doors and go , " oh , i touched your daughter 's leg " '			0
