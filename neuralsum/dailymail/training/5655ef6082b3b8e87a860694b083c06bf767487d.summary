heavy snow has turned @entity1 into a frozen winter wonderland , but the icicles and ice dams taking over local buildings are also a dangerous threat			0
@entity7 , @entity9 resident @entity8 had his car wrecked this weekend by falling ice that shattered the windows , dented the body and caved in the bumper			1
luckily the 28 - year - old was n't in the car at the time , since a 3 - foot - long ice chunk smashed through the windshield and landed right between the driver and passenger seats			1
he says the ice chunk was so heavy , both he and a tow truck driver struggled to move it together			0
he is now working with the building 's owner @entity37 to see if that man 's insurance will help fix the car ' i thought maybe an icicle would fall off , not a whole car - size piece of ice , ' mr @entity8 told @entity46 of his expectations parking his 2003 @entity36 outside the building on sunday			1
mr @entity8 dropped his car off in the morning , took the bus to @entity51 and then returned in the afternoon to find the startling damage			1
unfortunately , his liability insurance does n't cover the cost to fix his car and the city ca n't help either			2
' what they told me when i spoke to the police is that they ca n't really do much , because it 's an act of nature			0
but from what i saw , the size of those ice chunks , they 're a 100 - 150 - pound ice chunks , ' mr @entity8 said			1
however , he has contacted the building 's owner , @entity37 , who is looking into whether his insurance might cover the cost of repairs			1
mr @entity8 told the @entity71 that he talked to mr @entity37 on tuesday afternoon and that their conversation was friendly			2
wrecked : falling ice chunks shattered several windows on mr @entity8 's car and banged up much of the body rule breaking : it 's a violation of @entity7 city ordinance to leave dangerous icicles and ice dams on buildings ' he said he would contact his insurance and he seemed very nice about it , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' he did ask why i did nâ€™t park somewhere else			0
' on monday , the city investigated and determined that mr @entity37 had violated a city ordinance against dangerous ice and snow buildup			1
building owners are required to clean up such threatening ice , and if not , they can be fined up to $ 250			1
city officials say mr @entity37 will not face any sort of criminal charges			2
' when that ice dam is noticed , or obviously presents a hazard , they 're required to mitigate that hazard			0
' @entity98 of @entity99 and @entity100 said			0
time of need : friends have been helping drive mr @entity8 to and from his job as a bartender at a local restaurant and a @entity108 campaign has already raised over $ 3,000 for mr @entity8 's expenses however , mr @entity98 added that sometimes there are logistical challenges to keeping building owners from cleaning the dangerous ice in winter - such as the demand for workers to scrape the ice across the city			1
still , mr @entity98 says he 's never seen damage to a car as bad as what happened to mr @entity8			2
' it really was a significant chunk of ice that went through the windshield , ' mr @entity98 told @entity124			0
' i was surprised and actually glad that there was no one in the car			0
' in the meantime , friends have been driving mr @entity8 to and from his job as a bartender at @entity132 , and he has encountered even more support through a crowd - funding campaign that has already raised over $ 3,000 dollars			2
the @entity136 @entity135 has also offered to host a fundraiser for mr @entity8			0
' the amount of help that everybody has been putting forth is just unbelievable , ' mr @entity8 said .			0

@entity8 , 28 , parked his car in *downtown* @entity7 , @entity9 on sunday and returned to find it wrecked by falling ice chunks
some of the chunks that shattered the car 's windows and dented the body were as long as three feet and weighted over 100 pounds
the city says building owner @entity37 violated an ordinance to keep his building clear of ice , which carries a $ 250 fine
