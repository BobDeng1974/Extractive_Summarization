sprouts have certainly earned themselves a bad rep , falling out of favour with kids and grownups alike			2
the miniature vegetables have long been a staple on @entity8 dinner plates and also the subject of many a heated debate for their ' love them or hate them ' qualities			0
but despite their reluctant popularity on home shores they have never been a best - seller in @entity17 - until now			1
@entity8 growers have developed the kalette , a cross breed of sprouts and the popular superfood kale however , in a bid to get the cabbage - like vegetable back on the menu , cunning @entity8 growers have found a way to make it appeal to the trendy foodie			1
@entity8 experts have spent 15 years working tirelessly to perfect a tastier and more appealing version of the classic @entity32 sprout by cross-breeding it with kale			2
the leafy green superfood has become extremely trendy in recent years enjoyed by a-listers such as @entity37 and @entity38			1
growers first began developing the idea in 1995 but did n't begin selling the veg in the @entity8 until 2010 an 85g serving of @entity43 provides : @entity44 : @entity45 the new creations , called kalettes , taste milder and sweeter than @entity32 sprouts but growers had a battle on their hands to make @entity17 buyers see past the vegetable 's stuffy , old - fashioned image			1
they are the brainchild of independent @entity57 growers @entity58 , who began working on developing better - tasting @entity32 in 1995			2
as well as tasting better than the average @entity32 sprout , kalettes are also extremely hardy and produce heavy crops even through the coldest of winters			0
unlike @entity32 sprouts , which are typically boiled , kalettes can be steamed , roasted , stir - fried , grilled , microwaved or even raw			0
they hit the shelves in the @entity8 in 2010 under the name ' flower sprouts ' but have only just been launched in the @entity17			1
since hitting the @entity17 market in october the new creations have been flying off the shelves			1
they have proved such a hit that growers have had to step up production to try to meet the demand			1
kalettes have since appeared in magazines such as @entity77 and @entity78 , in papers like the @entity80 and on national news programmes such as @entity82			0
kalettes are a crossed between sprouts and kale and promise a sweeter - tasting vegetable @entity87 , from @entity58 , says that despite their recent popularity kalettes have been around for almost 20 years			1
' @entity90 came about initially from experiments we carried out in 1995 to create new vegetables by cross breeding them			0
' we found that the results of breeding @entity32 sprouts and kale were particularly good , with a great taste and a great look - milder in flavour than a @entity32 sprout with more attractive leaves			2
' @entity90 hit the @entity17 market back in october and have become so popular that growers have had to up their production in order to keep on top of the demand @entity87 said that although the initial idea was developed it took years of work before they perfected the vegetable			1
both @entity32 sprouts and kale belong to the @entity116 family of vegetables which also includes broccoli , cabbage , cauliflower , horseradish , turnip , radish and cress			2
@entity116 vegetables are renowned for their ability to be cross-bred with one another , which occurs because they are all derivatives of a wild cabbage that existed 5,000 years ago			0
the latin name for the @entity32 sprout is @entity133 while kale is @entity133 acephala			0
' but in growing it takes years and years to refine the product and get to a point where they can be mass produced and sold , ' he said			0
' we started talking to growers and supermarkets in 2005 and the feedback was positive but it takes a lot to launch a new vegetable that no - one 's ever heard of before			0
' after 15 years in the making the developers of the vegetable were thrilled when the product was met with huge success after being launched in the @entity8			0
' our creation finally hit the shelves in the @entity8 in 2010 under the name " flower sprouts " and was a real hit			0
' @entity8 people tend to view @entity32 sprouts are seen as a very old fashioned vegetable that are typically boiled			0
they 're a real @entity162 vegetable - certain people love them but a lot of people do n't			0
' we certainly felt flower sprouts would be more appealing to the modern customer			2
' when launching the vegetable overseas the marketers sought out a name to appeal to foodies			1
' historically @entity32 sprouts have been popular in western @entity173 countries but not a big seller in @entity17			1
' our marketing agency in the @entity176 cleverly ditched the name ' sprouts ' and rebranded them ' kalettes ' to capitalise on the popularity of kale as a superfood			1
' since the kalettes arrived in @entity17 the growers have been overwhelmed with their popularity			1
' we only launched kalettes in october but they have been flying off the shelves across the @entity17			1
everyone 's going crazy for them			0
' more by luck than judgement , here we are 20 years on with a hit product made from kale , the trendiest vegetable on the market today			2
' we never thought that when we began our experiments all those years ago we would have found success across the pond with the humble sprout			0
