lung cancer death rates among @entity2 women are expected to overtake those of breast cancer for the first time this year			1
the trend is largely driven by women in the @entity7 and their long history of smoking , say researchers			2
predicted lung cancer incidence for women in @entity2 is set to rise by 9 per cent between 2009 and 2015 , reaching a level of 14.24 per 100,000 of population			1
in contrast , death rates from breast cancer are due to fall by 10.2 per cent to 14.22 per 100,000			1
lung cancer death rates among @entity2 women are expected to overtake those of breast cancer this year			1
this trend is largely driven by @entity7 women 's propensity to smoke , according to new research ( file photo ) the bleakest women 's lung cancer forecasts are for the @entity7 and @entity27 , with 2015 death rates of 21 and 17 per 100,000 of population respectively			1
at the other end of the scale , just eight women per 100,000 are predicted to die from lung cancer in @entity34			2
despite lung cancer death rates statistically overtaking those of breast cancer , the total number of women dying from breast cancer is calculated to remain slightly higher			1
lung cancer is predicted to kill 87,500 @entity2 women this year and breast cancer 90,800			1
lead researcher professor @entity43 , from the @entity44 in @entity45 , said : ' @entity7 and @entity27 women , particularly @entity7 women , have long had much higher lung cancer rates than most other @entity2 countries ( except @entity49 , which is not considered separately in this study )			1
' this is due to the fact that @entity7 women started smoking during the @entity54 , while in most other @entity56 countries women started to smoke after 1968			1
it is worrying that female lung cancer rates are not decreasing in the @entity7 , but this probably reflects the fact that there was an additional rise in smoking prevalence in the @entity7 as well in the post- 1968 generation - those born after 1950			1
' the study looked at cancer rates in 28 @entity56 member states as a whole and also in the six largest countries , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity45 , @entity27 , @entity34 and the @entity7			2
as well as assessing overall cancer trends , it focused on individual cancers of the stomach , intestines , pancreas , lung , prostate , breast , and uterus / cervix , as well as leukaemia			0
it predicted a total of 1,359,100 deaths from cancer in the countries in 2015 , corresponding to an incident rate of 138.4 per 100,000 men and 83.9 per 100,000 women			0
lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer			0
over 41,000 people are diagnosed with the condition every year in the @entity7			0
there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer , but many people with the condition will eventually develop symptoms including : people with these symptoms are advised to visit their gp			0
source : @entity108 overall cancer deaths were due to fall by 7.5 per cent and 6 per cent in men and women respectively since 2009			0
in 1988 , more than a quarter of men and a fifth of women died of cancer			0
compared with that year , more than 325,000 cancer deaths are likely to be avoided in 2015			0
predicted death rates for lung , bowel and prostate cancer in men are expected to fall by 9 per cent , 5 per cent and 12 per cent respectively since 2009			2
death rates from pancreatic cancer since 2009 are forecast to rise by 4 per cent in men and 5 per cent in women			2
prof @entity43 added : ' we still have to be cautious about the lung cancer rates in women since these are predictions			2
the data for real death rates in 2015 in the @entity56 as a whole will be available in three to four years			0
' further caution is required due to the fact that the absolute numbers of deaths in 2015 remains higher for breast than for lung			0
however , the 2015 predictions confirm our projections on long - term trends made two years ago that lung cancer death rates would overtake breast cancer in women around 2015			1
' co-author professor @entity147 , from the @entity148 in @entity149 , said : ' while the downward trends in overall cancer death rates is good news , smoking still remains the greatest cause of cancer deaths in the @entity56			1
' for instance , smoking probably accounts for 15 per cent to 25 per cent of all pancreatic cancers , 85 per cent to 90 per cent of all lung cancers , and is implicated in a number of other cancers too			0
the differences in death rates between @entity2 countries remains a concern , with higher rates in the member states that joined most recently , such as the central and eastern @entity2 countries			2
' the findings appear in the journal @entity171 , whose associate editor for epidemiology professor @entity174 said : ' the decrease in overall cancer mortality rates among @entity2 men and women which started in the 1990s does not seem to slow down : this is the major favourable conclusion of the 2015 report			2
the bleakest women 's lung cancer forecasts are for the @entity7 and @entity27 , with 2015 death rates of 21 and 17 per 100,000 of population respectively			1
pictured is a chest x-ray of a smoker showing lung cancer ' on the other hand , the continuing increase in lung cancer mortality among @entity2 women represents a challenge for cancer control , and the steady increase in pancreatic cancer deserves high priority for research			1
' dr @entity199 , chief executive of the @entity200 , said : ' this latest forecast is unfortunately not surprising , and demonstrates once again just how poorly the @entity7 measures up to the rest of @entity2 in this arena			0
lung cancer rates in @entity7 women far exceed those of their @entity56 neighbours - and should be a cause of national embarrassment			1
' more than four in five cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking			0
it is essential that women - and men - quit smoking to lessen their chances of developing this condition or , better yet , never start at all			0
' if we are to reduce the death toll of this devastating cancer , we must see it given the same level of investment in research as we have seen afforded to other cancers , such as breast cancer			0
' it is also essential we see greater awareness of signs and symptoms , such as a persistent cough , to improve early diagnosis			0

lung cancer death rates are set to overtake breast cancer deaths this year
researchers blame high levels of smoking especially in @entity7 and @entity27
@entity7 women started smoking *regularly* during the @entity54
@entity2 women only took up the habit in the late 1960s
breast cancer rates are falling while lung cancer is on the increase
