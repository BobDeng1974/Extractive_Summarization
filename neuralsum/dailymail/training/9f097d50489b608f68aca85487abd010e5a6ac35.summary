by @entity0 a leading academic has warned too little is known about the side effects of the cholesterol - lowering statins giving statins to five million more patients is ‘ foolhardy ’ and ‘ unsafe ’ , according to an @entity7 academic			1
professor @entity8 warned that too little is known about the side effects of the drugs which include type 2 diabetes and muscular pain			1
tomorrow , the @entity15 watchdog @entity13 is expected to publish new guidelines urging @entity17 to offer them to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease within a decade			1
presently they are only given to those with a 20 per cent risk and around seven million @entity23 take them			1
they cost as little as 10p a day and work by lowering cholesterol in the blood , thereby preventing the arteries becoming clogged with fatty deposits			2
but leading gps , cardiologists and academics are concerned that not enough is known about side effects which include memory problems , dizziness , type 2 diabetes and muscular pain			1
they point out that very little research has been carried out into these risks and how many patients are affected			0
and it has also emerged that six of the 12 experts drawing up the guidelines have financial ties to drugs firms who make statins or similar pills			0
but @entity13 said the pills have the potential to save thousands of lives over the years at a minimum cost to the health service as they are so cheap			0
in a letter to the @entity57 , professor @entity8 , who specialises in public health epidemiology , wrote : ‘ recommending that five million more people take statins lifelong for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease without knowing enough about the side effects is foolhardy			1
he said : ‘ the data on side effects need to be public and scrutinised by qualified independent assessors			2
professor @entity8 said the only studies to look at the effectiveness of statins had been funded by manufacturers , so were therefore biased			1
they may well overstate the drug ’s effectiveness while underplaying any risks			0
professor @entity8 warned that the same tactics had been used by firms making @entity80 who had downplayed the risk of heart disease			1
similarly , manufacturers or the oral contraceptive pill had published work which had underestimated their link to blood clots			0
last week figures from the @entity90 showed prescriptions for statins had trebled in a decade with 58.1 million handed out last year			0
the rise is partly due to an incentive scheme for @entity17 , the @entity95 , whereby they earn extra money for prescribing statins for high risk patients			2
statins cost as little as 10p per day and work by lowering cholesterol in the blood , thereby preventing the arteries becoming clogged other experts say the benefits by far outweigh the risks including professor @entity107 , clinical epidemiologist at @entity108 , who claims ‘ the jury is no longer out ’			2
speaking earlier this month , he added : ‘ trials have shown unequivocally that statins reduce coronary heart disease mortality and there are very low levels of severe side effects			1
‘ we are not forcing these tablets down people ’s throats , we are giving people the evidence on which to make a decision			0
’ and @entity124 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity126 , said : ‘ the prescription of cholesterol lowering medications has been increasing steadily for many years now			0
‘ this reflects the efforts that have been made to better identify people at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease through initiatives such as the @entity136 programme			2
‘ statins are one of the most studied medicines available today			0
they have been proven to be safe and effective and are vital in helping reduce people ’s risk of heart attack and stroke			0
