@entity0 would like the @entity2 fans to buy into his patient approach to their @entity5 qualifier against @entity6 - but he knows that is unlikely to happen			1
the @entity2 boss recognises the @entity9 will turn up expecting plenty of goals - and quickly - against @entity13 's newest members			1
however , @entity0 has confidence that his players will cope with those expectations and produce a mature display against the team from the @entity19			1
@entity2 squad are put through their paces ahead of their upcoming @entity22 against @entity6 @entity2 's @entity23 ( left ) speaks with @entity24 prior to their training session @entity0 arrives at @entity2 's press conference at @entity28 ahead of the match all week he has drilled into his players the need to probe for openings rather than rush balls forward too soon - and he is optimistic the practice will pay off			1
speaking just before taking his players for a training session at a wet and windy @entity28 , @entity0 said : ' we do n't want to be panicking and rush into things			1
we will look forward and try to play forward at every occasion , but that ca n't happen all the time			0
' there are areas where we will have space to go and attack , there are areas where it might be harder			0
we will have to be patient to get the areas where we think we can work at being successful			2
' when asked whether he had a message for supporters to replicate that patience , the former @entity48 boss said : ' that would be handy if they could			0
' but fans come along to lose their inhibitions , shout and scream			2
they want to see goals			2
' if the weather was scorching hot , they would maybe be more patient but i do n't think it 's going to be like that			0
i think the fans will be wanting something to warm them up right away			0
' but we ca n't be sucked into trying to score a goal with the first touch of the ball			0
we have done a lot of work and you might at times think we are not going anywhere , but we have to be patient and try to find the weaknesses			0
' @entity74 ( centre ) focused in training in front of @entity78 ( left ) and @entity79 ( right ) @entity74 leads the @entity2 squad in training on the pitch at @entity28 on saturday @entity2 's @entity82 ( front ) gears up ahead of his side 's clash against @entity6 @entity0 has his own cautionary tale from may 1991 when @entity2 laboured away to international newcomers @entity88 in a @entity90 qualifier before the then @entity92 midfielder broke the deadlock from the spot in the 63rd minute , on their way to a 2 - 0 win			1
' it was n't an easy ride , that 's for sure , ' @entity0 said			1
' i have taken a lot of penalties in big games but that one was really pressurised because i did n't want to be remembered as the guy that missed a penalty against @entity88			0
' we had some good players playing in that team and it took a corner - kick and a penalty			0
' @entity0 's side have made a positive start to the group with a draw in @entity118 and victory over the @entity120 putting them in a decent position , although their two main rivals for second spot - assuming @entity124 will win @entity125 - previously stole a march by taking points off the world champions			1
@entity0 believes @entity6 , who pick their team from a population of about 30,000 , are a more difficult challenge than when they began their competitive international campaign			1
@entity2 's @entity135 ( left ) and @entity136 are put through their paces at training @entity2 players warm up on the @entity28 pitch ahead of the game with @entity6 on sunday @entity74 leads the players as they get accustomed to the turf at the @entity146 stadium they conceded seven goals against both @entity118 and the @entity148 but then the same amount combined in games against @entity151 and @entity124			1
they have already secured their first friendly win , against @entity154 , and also drew in @entity155 last year			0
@entity0 said : ' in the first couple of games of the championship , the excitement was so great , but you could see in the @entity124 game there was a bit of reality about it			1
the world champions only scored four goals			0
' four goals is definitely enough to win a game of football , that 's for sure , but that 's the improvement we have seen from the first couple of games			0
you get over that initial excitement of just being there and then you want to be hard to beat , and i think that 's the stage @entity6 will be at			2
' @entity178 's @entity177 was not present at training , although @entity0 said earlier that he could pick any one of his three goalkeepers and ' not lose any sleep ' .			2

@entity2 face @entity6 in @entity5 qualifier on sunday
@entity0 aware that @entity2 fans will turn up expecting goals
@entity188 *explains* that his side will be patient against their group *minnows*
