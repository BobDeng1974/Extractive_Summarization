by @entity1 reporter published : 13:17 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 15:42 est , 17 january 2013 a terminally ill nine - year - old whose last wish was to break a world record for receiving the most @entity7 cards before succumbing to his life - long battle with cystic fibrosis has died - but not before hitting his goal			1
@entity13 , who inspired hundreds of thousands around the world to help him reach his goal , amassed more than 700,000 cards in his rural @entity17 home , more than tripling the old record			1
' the cards give him something to look forward to			2
something to get excited about , ' @entity13 's mother @entity21 told @entity22 before his death			2
on saturday , the tiny boy honoured as a courageous junior deputy , junior firefighter and junior rescuer by his local police and fire department , finally lost his fight			0
big accomplishment : nine - year - old @entity13 , who suffered from cystic fibrosis , received hundreds of thousands of @entity7 cards from strangers across the world wishing him a merry @entity7 outreach : the nine - year - old , pictured with his family here , had battled cystic fibrosis his entire life before amassing more than 700,000 cards in just a few weeks multiplying : in what started out as a few several hundred cards quickly multiplied with the family soon unable to contain them all in their rural @entity17 home in a funeral service held on wednesday just a sample of the handmade and store - bought cards were seen decorating the @entity50 to @entity51 in @entity52			1
' there were lots and lots of people there , ' @entity53 who attended the service told @entity22			0
' members of the police department , and the fire department , and the sheriff			0
it felt like the whole town was here			0
' but what remains to be seen if the 9 - year - old did in fact earn his name in the record books			2
the last official @entity72 record for a @entity7 card category in 1992 was for 205,120 cards by @entity76 @entity75			1
the family 's application to the @entity79 has yet to be made according to a spokeswoman			1
@entity72 is also currently not monitoring attempts for receiving @entity7 cards			1
extras : adding one more card to his wish , along with a present from @entity87 seated before him , @entity13 opens and reads just one of his hundreds of thousands of cards plea : it originally started after a family friend posted on @entity92 asking for cards bearing warm wishes that his parents , @entity97 and @entity98 , pictured , could put up in the home - and the message went viral generosity : the youngster received more than half a million cards , which no longer fit in his family home loved : @entity106 brought him 30,000 on @entity108 alone			1
volunteers handpick ones for him to read all over : boxes and boxes of the cards were collected for the boy from all over the word , some in languages he and his family could n't read outpouring : piles and piles of letters are seen in @entity123 boxes awaiting sorting ' at this time , there has been no formal record application made with @entity79 for this particular attempt , so we are unable to speculate on whether or not it would constitute a new record , ' spokeswoman @entity124 told @entity22			1
if the application is submitted , ms @entity131 said they will consider re-opening ' a designation for his feat. ' cards seen stacked in the family 's garage and swamping the home have come from as far afield as @entity140 , the @entity141 and @entity142 in what his mother @entity97 calls ' a @entity7 miracle '			2
the first few trickled in after a family friend wrote a post on @entity92 asking for messages of support that @entity21 could place on the mantlepiece for her sick son			1
but as cards started coming in from neighbours and friends , the @entity92 message began spreading across the social network and was picked up by local media			1
with this boost came thousands more cards , including stacks hand - delivered by @entity163 and @entity164			2
show of support : a stack of the cards was hand - delivered to @entity13 by @entity163 state troopers battle : @entity13 relies on a mask to help him breathe			1
doctors said he had just days to live in october , but his mother said the cards have helped him become like he was before the illness really took hold , right on christmas eve alone , the postal service delivered 30,000 letters and 1,972 packages , some of which were crammed full with cards , @entity183 , from the @entity123 , told @entity22			2
in addition to these , services such as @entity106 and @entity185 delivered hundreds more			0
there are so many that the cards could longer fit in the family 's home and the postal service could no longer fit them all into a truck			1
instead , in another show of goodwill , a local television reporter had started filling a trailer to bring all the cards to @entity13 's grandfather 's church			2
there , dozens of volunteers were sifting through the thousands of letters , opening each one and saving special ones to take @entity13 to read himself			2
' one little girl said she wished he was her boyfriend , ' volunteer @entity206 said			0
' the big majority of the town has sent cards or is helping out			0
everyone just wants to do what we can			0
' @entity215 hands : requiring extra help to handle and sort all the letters , the youngster was soon aided by volunteers , several seen here outpouring : the number of cards he has received has easily overtaken the last record in 1992 of 205,120 the youngster had stage four cystic fibrosis , which makes it near impossible to breathe			1
he took 18 different medicines each day and wore a face mask to help him breath			0
in october , doctors gave him just two to eight days to live , @entity21 said			0
but ' he 's doing pretty good now , ' she said			0
' it 's just been the best @entity7 ever			0
he 's excited for the first time in a long time			0
he 's laughing more , he 's beginning to become how he was two years ago			0
' i think just knowing people really do care for him , that the cards let him know people love him , it has all helped			0
' there is no time limit on when @entity13 can stop receiving the cards , the @entity72 spokesperson said .			1

@entity13 , who suffered cystic fibrosis , began receiving cards from all over the world when a family friend put plea on @entity92
last record was 205,120 set in 1992 - but @entity79 said it is no longer monitoring the category
family hopes @entity72 will re-open the category to recognize his feat
