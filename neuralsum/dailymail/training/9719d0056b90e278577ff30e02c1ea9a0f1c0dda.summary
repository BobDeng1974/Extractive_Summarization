a mother who gave birth on the side of the road on the way to hospital had the amazing event recorded by her birth photographer who was luckily trailing her car			1
@entity9 , 29 , from @entity10 in @entity11 , welcomed daughter @entity12 in the front seat of the family car as her husband and three - year - old son looked on			1
but she was unaware that her friend and birth photographer @entity17 , 28 , had been driving behind the family just in case anything happened on the way to the hospital			1
after getting up and stretching six times in three hours she realised she was actually being woken by contractions			0
ms @entity9 , who is a @entity35 practitioner , felt her first contraction or ' surge ' at 5.50am but she told her husband was n't sure she was in labour because she had n't felt any other signs			1
' after i got in the shower i said " i 'm having another surge " , ' she told @entity44			0
ms @entity9 got out of the shower briefly to tend to her three - year - old son @entity46 who had just woken up and had three more surges in her bedroom while he supported her			2
but as her surges got stronger she wanted to get back into the shower and the comforting hot water			0
about 20 minutes into the 35 minute drive to the hospital her water broke and she told her husband @entity55 ( right ) they needed to pull over ms @entity9 said she was n't thinking about the fact she was in a car , and the only challenge was labouring in the car sitting upright ' i just thought i ca n't get out of the shower it 's too comfortable in here , ' ms @entity9 said			1
meanwhile her husband @entity64 , 29 , had been timing her surges and noticed they were just four minutes apart			0
he started packing the car for hospital and had contacted ms @entity9 's doula and birth photographer to let them know the labour was progressing quickly			1
' i thought i had more time , ' ms @entity9 said			1
' our doula had told my husband to get me out of the shower since i was not wanting to get out of there , she knew i needed to get to the hospital			0
' reluctantly i got out , and things really sped up , i could hardly make it from one room to the next without having to stop for a surge			0
' the family got in the car to start the 35 minute drive to the hospital , not knowing that photographer ms @entity17 had made it to their house before they left and was following them ' just in case anything happened on the way '			2
after the birth ms @entity9 heard a female voice asking her if everything was ok and was shocked to find out it was ms @entity17 , who had captured the entire event mr @entity64 was reluctant to stop the car as he thought they could make it to the hospital but ms @entity9 's water broke and she told him she could feel the baby 's head ms @entity9 was very uncomfortable sitting upright in the car , and at one point exclaimed : ' i do n't want to do this in the car , it 's too hard ! ' about 20 minutes into the drive she knew she needed to pull over			1
mr @entity64 was reluctant to stop as he thought they could make it to the hospital but ms @entity9 's water broke and she told him she could feel the baby 's head			1
' i reached down and felt a warm little head , i was excited and surprised at the same time , ' ms @entity9 said			2
' my husband then pulled over and quickly jumped out of the car , he came to the passenger side and opened my door as i lifted my bottom off the seat and only just had enough time to pull my pants down to my mid-thigh before the baby 's head completely emerged with a gush of warm amniotic fluid			2
ms @entity9 said @entity12 is healthy and ' totally in love ' with her brother @entity46 , three ms @entity9 said the pictures were more perfect than she could have hoped for ' the next surge and her body came out into her daddy 's hands and i immediately reached down to pick her up and bring her to my chest			1
' ms @entity9 said she was n't thinking about the fact she was in a car			1
' the only challenge was actually labouring in the car sitting upright , that was n't my position of choice , ' she said			2
meanwhile ms @entity17 had also pulled over and grabbed her camera to run around to the passenger door			0
' pretty much the first picture i took was baby coming out so not a second to lose , ' ms @entity17 told @entity44			0
' none of us were stressed at all we were all actually really happy and it was beautiful			0
after the birth mr @entity64 called an ambulance and the family was taken to hospital where baby @entity12 's umbilical cord was cut ' we could tell straight away that her baby was fine			1
' after the birth ms @entity9 heard a female voice asking her if everything was ok and was shocked to find out it was mr @entity160 , who had captured the entire event			2
' i was completely elated that she had captured that wondrous moment , a moment that still sounds fictional every time i say it out loud , ' she said			0
' it helped me to process the actual event as well			0
' it was so surreal that it happened in the car			0
it was n't stressful but i actually had to pinch myself afterwards that it happened like that			0
' ms @entity9 said the pictures , which have been posted onto ms @entity17 's website thebirthstory.com.au , were more perfect than she could have hoped for			1
ms @entity9 pictured on tuesday with healthy baby @entity12 who is now six weeks old ' i wanted pictures of the baby coming out but i did n't want them to be really graphic , ' she said			1
' they 're so descriptive but really tame			0
' the two women have known each other for two years , and ms @entity17 has taken ms @entity9 's @entity185 classes in the past			2
after the birth mr @entity64 called an ambulance and the family was taken to hospital where baby @entity12 's umbilical cord was cut			1
ms @entity9 and @entity12 were healthy so they were discharged six hours later			1
ms @entity9 wants other mothers to know that if they find themselves in a similar situation it 's not necessarily a cause for concern			2
' if a birth is happening that quickly it 's very rare that there 's a complication , ' she said			0
' complicated births are not quick births			0
