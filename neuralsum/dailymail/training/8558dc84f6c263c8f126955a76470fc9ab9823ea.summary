a couple whose saucy emails went viral on @entity3 have both resigned from their jobs in humiliation			1
receptionist @entity6 wrote a string of graphic emails to her partner @entity9 about their love - life - and then accidentally forwarded them to all her workmates			1

' the receptionist sent a brief message to colleagues at @entity49 to let them know the sandwich van was outside			1
that sinking feeling : @entity6 was trying to be helpful and alert everyone to the sandwich van - but revealed a lot more than she would have liked but she accidentally wrote the message on the top of her private mail and sent them the whole email trail by mistake			1
within a few hours the email had been sent to other oil firms in @entity33 and was all over social networking sites such as @entity3			2
the receptionist began emailing her fiance at 9.48am and he replied : ' @entity67 * * * * * , i fancy you xxx ' @entity9 then sent his wife - to - be another racy message , complimenting her about their love life : ' i love making love to you it 's ace			1
' she replied : ' good because i totally fancy you			0
' a short time later @entity9 states : ' i loved our s * * * * * * last night ... it was ace			1
' email perils : the receptionist emailed her colleagues - but accidentally sent them all a trail of private messages and @entity6 replied : ' as i do you handsome , sexy husband			1
' the emails were then accidentally sent to other colleagues at the harbour office			1
@entity32 said the couple were ' mortified ' and had apologised for any offence it caused			0
the couple were not available to speak yesterday and could not be tracked down			0
@entity9 is believed to have proposed to his girlfriend last year , and their email discussed how they would wed in 310 days			1
one member of staff , @entity101 , sent out an email after receiving it herself saying : ' our receptionist is having a productive morning ! @entity107 ... ' @entity6 sent saucy emails to her partner @entity9 - before accidentally forwarding them on to the rest of her colleagues and within an hour the email trail had found its way into the inboxes of other oil staff working at completely different firms and the email has become a viral sensation			1
one @entity3 user , known as @entity119 , seemed unimpressed by the content , mocking the pair for their way of expressing themselves			0
she wrote : ' # sandwichvan is pure gold			0
" i love making love to you , it 's ace " - @entity127 - rivaling the @entity132 in the language of love since 2013			0
' another @entity3 user , called @entity136 , clearly enjoyed the mistake though			0

student @entity151 was trying to forward the message to his mother so they could discuss how to handle a bill			2

but instead of replying to just him , he accidentally replied to the 4,000 employment leads @entity182 had contacted in the first place			0
the @entity185 reported that mr @entity177 was so incensed by the email , he replied by telling the prospective employee to ' f * * * off '			0
