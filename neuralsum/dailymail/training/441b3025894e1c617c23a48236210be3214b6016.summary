@entity1 ’s last major decision as chief executive of the @entity3 before he retires in september is likely to be his most far - reaching of all			1
brace yourself for the distinct possibility that at the start of next month he will announce live coverage of the @entity10 , from 2016 onwards , will be shown only on @entity11			1
even now , the natural instinct is to believe the @entity13 will pull back from the brink and @entity10 will still be live on the @entity15 , if only over the weekend			1
they could n’t take the biggest tournament in the sport away from the biggest audience , could they ? yet , few insiders in @entity21 last week believed that will prove the outcome			1
@entity24 kisses the @entity25 after his two - stroke victory at the @entity27 once upon a time the @entity15 showed more than 30 days of live golf each year but it looks as if , to all intents and purposes , they are all but done			0
if so , it ’s devastating news for the future of the game in this country			2
is it merely coincidence that participation levels have plummeted in tandem with the @entity15 ’s retreat from showing the game on our screens ? clubs are closing up and down the country			2
councils with budgets under pressure are wondering why they should continue to pour resources into municipal courses			0
true , there are plenty of other reasons for this sad state of affairs , like the game takes too long for working men and women under 50 , with young kids of their own to consider			0
but it would be naive not to believe there ’s some correlation between the lack of golf on terrestrial television and the decline in numbers taking up the game			2
let ’s say at this point , this is not a dig at @entity11			1
they do a tremendous job if you ’re a golf aficionado , with their comprehensive coverage of the @entity80 and @entity81 tours			1
you might even be pleased if they snap up @entity10 , with their superior camera production values			1
@entity86 's triumph was available for all to see on @entity15 , but that all may change with the rumoured new tv deal it ’s the casual fans we are thinking about here , and the impressionable teenage lovers of sport who watch all games and are still seeking out their favourite			1
how on earth is the game going to appeal to this latter group if it ’s never on free - to - air tv ? think of sir @entity100			2
channel - hopping late at night several decades ago , this then keen cyclist with no interest in golf came across the masters — and look how that ended up			0
the @entity13 ’s professed mandate is to grow the game but it ’s hard to see how taking live coverage from the @entity15 squares with that			2
could they not do a similar deal like the one with the masters , whereby they share live coverage at the weekend ? i understand there ’s little enthusiasm at @entity11 for such an arrangement			1
not unreasonably , if they ’re giving the @entity13 a huge pot of gold , they want exclusive live rights			0
undoubtedly , heads were turned at the @entity13 in 2013 when the @entity125 , their @entity127 equivalent , took the @entity128 away from its traditional broadcast partner and gave it to the relative newcomer , @entity131 , in a deal worth £ 800million over 12 years			2
at 13 years of age , sir @entity100 was inspired to play golf while watching the 1971 masters on television but the differences are marked			0
@entity131 is still a free - to - air television channel and , in any case , the game is shown every weekend on such television stations in @entity127			2
it does n’t need any more exposure			0
will the @entity13 break with more than a half - century of tradition ? we will find out soon enough			0
but let ’s hope that , even at this 11th hour , they move back from the precipice			0
to think , the announcement might even come at the same time as the world no 1 @entity24 is in the witness stand in a @entity152 courtroom , where some sharp lawyers will be trawling his financial affairs through the mud			0
apologies for coming over all doom - laden following the dramatic start to the season in @entity21 last week			1
but the early days of february are shaping up to be bleak indeed for the @entity3 game			0
@entity161 is favourite to be appointed @entity80 ’s @entity163 captain in mid-february not long to wait now until @entity161 is appointed @entity80 ’s @entity163 captain			1
the five - man committee that will choose @entity166 ’s successor are due to meet in mid-february , with an announcement expected the same evening			0
given @entity161 has the backing of all the leading players it is inconceivable the committee would overlook such unanimity and bestow the honour on someone else			1
as one of the great characters of the @entity80 game over the past 20 years and a formidable @entity163 player in the past , @entity161 deserves his chance , too			1
quote of the week ‘ ball - striking , i do n’t think i could have done much more			0
i exceeded my own expectations in that regard , so it all bodes well for the new season			0
’ @entity24 , after a runner - up finish in @entity21 left him with this record from his last six @entity187 starts : 1,1,1,2,2,2			1
next is the @entity188 — where he achieved his first tour win in 2009 .			0

the @entity10 could be shown on @entity11 from 2016 onwards
insiders in @entity21 believe the deal will be *confirmed* soon
@entity161 is set be appointed @entity80 ’s @entity163 captain in february
