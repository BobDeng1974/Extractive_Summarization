by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:33 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 30 september 2013 dressed in a green surgical gown and cap , @entity3 restaurateur @entity2 cradled her newborn daughter at the @entity8 clinic in northwestern @entity9 as her husband @entity10 smiled warmly , peering in through a glass door			1
‘ i ca n't believe we have our own child at last , ’ said @entity2 , 42 , gazing in wonderment at five - day - old @entity13			0
‘ we are really grateful to our surrogate mother who managed to get pregnant and kept our little daughter healthy			2
she gave nine months of her life to give us a child			0
’ delight : @entity2 , 42 ( right ) , from @entity3 , holds her week - old - baby girl , @entity21 , as she stands next to a doctor at the @entity24 centre in @entity26 town sweet dreams : @entity21 sleeps in a hotel room in @entity26 town it is the perfect promotion for @entity9 's booming surrogacy industry that sees thousands of infertile couples , many from overseas , hiring the wombs of local women to carry their embryos through to birth			1
but a debate over whether the unregulated industry exploits poor women prompted authorities to draft a law that could make it tougher for foreigners seeking babies made in @entity9			1
‘ there is a need to regulate the sector , ’ said dr. @entity45 of @entity9 , a @entity47 - based fertility bank that has produced 295 surrogate babies - 90 percent for overseas clients and 40 percent for same - sex couples - since it opened in 2007			1
proud : @entity2 holds her week - old - baby girl @entity21 , as her husband @entity54 , 39 , looks on ‘ but if the new law tightens rules as suggested by the ministry of home affairs , which disallows surrogacy for same - sex couples and single parents , then it will clearly impact the industry and put off clients coming from overseas			2
’ @entity9 opened up to commercial surrogacy in 2002			2
it is among just a handful of countries - including @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 - and a few @entity72 states where women can be paid to carry another 's genetic child through a process of in - vitro fertilisation ( @entity24 ) and embryo transfer			1
the low - cost technology , skilled doctors , scant bureaucracy and a plentiful supply of surrogates have made @entity9 a preferred destination for fertility tourism , attracting nationals from @entity3 , the @entity72 , @entity86 and @entity87 , to name a few			1
there are no official figures on how large the fertility industry is in @entity9			2
a @entity92 - backed study in july 2012 estimated the surrogacy business at more than $ 400 million a year ( £ 250 million ) , with over 3,000 fertility clinics across @entity9			1
the @entity8 clinic in @entity26 is the best - known at home and abroad , giving the small town in @entity99 state the reputation as @entity9 's ‘ surrogacy capital ’			2
‘ the surrogates in @entity26 have become empowered through giving this beautiful gift to others , ’ says @entity103 's owner , @entity24 specialist @entity102 , who shot to fame in 2004 after she helped a patient have a baby by using the woman 's mother - the child 's grandmother - as a surrogate			0
adoring : @entity2 looks at @entity21 at the @entity24 centre , which is one of about 3,000 fertility clinics in @entity9 ‘ with the money , they are able to buy a house , educate their children and even start a small business			1
these are things they could only dream of before			0
it 's a win - win situation			0
’ @entity2 , who appeared on @entity72 celebrity @entity125 's talk show in 2007 , has produced more than 500 surrogate babies - two - thirds of them for foreigners and people of @entity130 origin living in over 30 countries			1
charging couples like @entity2 and @entity10 an average of $ 25,000 to $ 30,000 , a fraction of the cost in the @entity72 , @entity2 pays her surrogates around 400,000 rupees ( £ 4,000 or $ 6,500 )			1
for 33 - year - old @entity138 , who gave birth to @entity13 , the compensation outweighs the downside			0
the wife of an auto - rickshaw driver with three daughters of her own , she had to live in a hostel for nine months with 60 other surrogates so the clinic could monitor her health			0
@entity9 's surrogacy industry is vilified by women 's rights groups like most surrogates , she kept her pregnancy a secret due to the social stigma in @entity9 's conservative society			1
‘ i was happy to do it but it was not really out of choice because we needed the money , ’ she said in a hospital bed as she recovered from the @entity158 operation for @entity13 's birth			0
@entity9 's surrogacy industry is vilified by women 's rights groups who say fertility clinics are nothing more than ‘ baby factories ’ for the rich			1
in the absence of regulation , they say many poor and uneducated women are lured by agents , hired by clinics , into signing contracts they do not fully understand			2
in may last year , surrogate mother @entity178 , 30 , died days after delivering a child for an @entity72 couple at a clinic in @entity99			2
it was recorded as an ‘ accidental death ’ by police			0
@entity2 touches surrogate mother @entity138 's ( centre ) biological daughter inside a temporary home for surrogates provided by the @entity24 centre a recent government - funded study of 100 surrogate mothers in @entity193 and @entity47 found there was ‘ no fixed rule ’ related to compensation and no insurance for post-delivery healthcare			1
it cited cases where surrogates were implanted with embryos multiple times to raise the chances of success			0
‘ in most of these cases , the surrogate mothers are being exploited , ’ said @entity206 , director of the @entity207 that conducted the study			1
moves to introduce a law - the @entity213 ( @entity214 ) - to protect surrogates , the children and the commissioning parents is long overdue , @entity206 said			0
revised visa requirements introduced in july have already resulted in foreign same - sex couples and individuals being prohibited from surrogacy in @entity9			2
the @entity214 bill , expected to come before parliament next year , will tighten things further			0
under the current draft , all fertility clinics must be registered and monitored by a regulatory authority			1
surrogates must be between 21 and 35 years old , they will be provided with insurance and notarised contracts must be signed between the women and the commissioning parents			0
‘ legislation should be there so that this wonderful procedure can be supervised and it is being done by the right people for the right people , ’ said @entity233			0
‘ but more bureaucracy will make it difficult for everyone			0
it will not only mean less commissioning parents from overseas but it will also impact surrogates , who will lose out on the only chance they have to change their lives for the better			0

only a handful of countries allow women to make money from surrogacy
surrogate mothers charge around £ 4,000 in @entity9 , a fraction of the @entity72 cost
there are 3,000 fertility clinics in @entity9 , but they *'re* vilified by *campaigners*
