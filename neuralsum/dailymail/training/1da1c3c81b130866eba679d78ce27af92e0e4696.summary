a rabbi from @entity2 , @entity0 is being sued for severing a newborn baby 's penis during a botched @entity6 ceremony			2
rabbi @entity7 , who is also a mohel , performed the ceremony at @entity9 in @entity10 earlier this year on april 28			1
the @entity11 reported that the parents have remained anonymous to protect the identity of their son			0
rabbi @entity7 is a rabbi , and a mohel who claimed to be ' trained , ' yet managed to accidentally dismember a baby 's penis the newborn baby boy had to be rushed to @entity20 where doctors performed an emergency micro-surgery to reattach the dismembered penis			1
@entity24 reported that the boy needed six blood transfusions and was hospitalized for two months			1
the delicate surgery took about eight hours long			2
@entity24 spoke with a plastic surgeon named doctor @entity29 about the process of micro surgery			1
' if your finger , your thumb was cut off and was put back on , that is pretty exciting , ' @entity29 said			0
' sometimes , it does n’t always work , ' he says			0
“ when you ’re reattaching a portion where you include nerves , sometimes the nerves do n’t heal well beyond where you reattached it			0
so there are limitations for sure			0
' the baby 's microsurgery was reported ' successful ' , but whether or not the baby will have problems later on in life is still unknown			2
despite the gruesome incident , the rabbi still practices as a mohel			1
@entity24 spoke with attorney @entity52 who handles cases pertaining to botched circumcisions by either a mohel or a doctor			1
there is no regulated method for training mohel 's that perform the bris the @entity6 was performed at @entity62 synagogue in @entity2 , @entity0 ' that is extraordinarily serious and is extraordinarily rare , ' said attorney @entity52			2
he spoke of how @entity6 services are usually unregulated			0
' there ’s virtually no regulation of this any place in the @entity68 that i know of , ' @entity52 said			0
' i think the government probably should require some sort of training if this is going to be done			0
' ' your average pediatric urologist probably spends about 20 percent of his or her time repairing children who have been circumcised , ' @entity52 told @entity24			0
according to @entity7 's website , ' @entity76 must be performed by a @entity79 person who understands , upholds , and practices the tenets of the @entity79 religion , and is specially trained to function as a mohel			1
' @entity7 claims he is well trained in circumcision and calls this case a ' tragic accident			1
' he also claims that receiving a @entity6 in a hospital may not be recognized under @entity79 law			2
mayor @entity88 has spoken out about medical circumcision following 11 herpes outbreaks in 2001 in @entity91 in an @entity93 @entity79 circumcision ritual called metzitzah b’peh — or oral suction — in which the mohel puts his mouth directly on the newborn ’s circumcised penis and sucks out the blood			1
the mohel had transmitted herpes to the children			0
@entity88 wrote an open latter to mohel 's asking them to move away from the ceremony			0
the surgery lasted for 8 hours and the baby needed 6 blood transfusions @entity7 's website claims he is ' specially trained in the medical and surgical technique of circumcision '			1

the child had to have micro-surgery , was in the hospital for two months , and required a blood transfusion
the surgery was ' successful ' but only time can tell how *bad* the *damage* is
rabbi @entity7 claims he is a ' trained ' mohel and that having a doctor perform a circumcision is *unethical*
