by @entity0 last updated at 1:10 am on 26th june 2011 dragons ’ @entity3 star @entity2 is facing more questions over his use of taxpayers ’ money at a charity he set up for young entrepreneurs			1
@entity11 ’s @entity10 has launched a new inquiry into claims of financial mismanagement at the @entity15 , revealed in @entity16 last week			2
but it can now be disclosed that four of mr @entity2 ’s companies have been paid more than £ 900,000 over the past three years to provide services to the charity , set up to teach business skills to teenagers			1
family ties : @entity2 with his long - term partner @entity27 whose father has taken over the running of the academy they include his telecoms giant @entity31 , which made a profit of nearly £ 11 million in the year to april 2010 , and his television production company @entity34			1
these firms , along with his web media agency @entity36 and phone handset distributor @entity38 , supplied the @entity15 with hardware , marketing services and it support			2
in another development , @entity16 can reveal that the academy is now being run by the father of mr @entity2 ’s girlfriend @entity27			1
@entity47 , 61 , has taken over as acting chief executive , although he appears to have little experience of managing a large educational institution			0
@entity52 records show that his only current directorship is human resources director at a swimming school run by his wife @entity57 from their home in @entity59 , @entity60			2
the school teaches at a leisure centre in the town			0
chief executive : miss @entity27 's father @entity47 on a walking holiday mr @entity47 , whose daughter @entity66 has three children with mr @entity2 , is also registered as a former consultant to a company called the @entity70 , which was dissolved in 2009			1
mr @entity2 ’s spokesman said mr @entity47 was well qualified for the @entity15 post and that his family link to the tycoon enhanced his ability to do the job			1
the allegations of financial mismanagement were made by former civil servant @entity79 , who was brought in by mr @entity2 to run the academy last year			1
mr @entity79 quit after only a week in the £ 138,000 - a - year job because he was concerned about the way up to £ 9 million of public money was being spent			0
the @entity15 ’s finance director says this figure is incorrect and that the actual amount of money involved is £ 6.5 million for a project to cover a seven - year business plan			2
in a letter to mr @entity2 – the contents of which were revealed by @entity16 last week – mr @entity79 claimed the @entity15 was failing to attract the expected number of students and was in danger of running out of money			1
the @entity97 has now learned that the @entity15 could lose an expected £ 500,000 after senior industrialists failed to reach an agreement with the @entity100 , the tycoon ’s personal charity through which funding for the @entity15 is channelled			2
the money was to have come from a body called @entity105 , which was set up in 2004 by business organisations , including the @entity107 and the @entity108 , to encourage entrepreneurship			0
scandal : how the @entity16 revealed the story last week the @entity112 pumped up to £ 10 million into it , but the funding was switched off by the @entity115 and groups were invited to bid for the remaining assets			0
mr @entity2 claimed in march that his foundation had been selected to receive the money after he made a successful pitch , but trustees of @entity122 now say no final decision has been reached and that other charities could be invited to apply for the cash as early as next month			1
in a statement after a trustees ’ meeting on friday , @entity127 director general @entity126 said : ‘ it was agreed that unless the terms and conditions of the due diligence process were agreed by the @entity100 by the end of the month , and the exercise successfully concluded			0
by @entity137 , @entity122 will seek expressions of interest from other charitable organisations engaged in enterprise promotion			0
’ an @entity15 source , however , gave a different explanation for the delay			0
he said it had been caused by the trustees ’ insistence that the @entity100 should take over full legal liability for @entity122 and all its remaining assets , while mr @entity2 wanted liability to be capped at £ 500,000			1
mr @entity2 said last night : ‘ we hope all outstanding issues will be resolved next week			1
’ whistle blower : mr @entity2 with former civil servant @entity79 , whose claims of financial mismanagement were revealed last week meanwhile , the @entity10 has launched a new inquiry into mr @entity79 ’s allegations , after initially insisting that an investigation by the @entity158 had found no evidence to substantiate his claims			1
it is understood that mr @entity79 , who was not asked to give evidence to the initial inquiry , will now be contacted by mr @entity11 ’s officials			2
a spokesman for mr @entity2 said @entity36 , @entity34 , phones @entity165 and @entity38 had provided services to the @entity15 on favourable terms during its start - up period			1
he added : ‘ the remaining companies [ in his portfolio ] have donated their time free of charge and without charging for supplies and / or overheads in support of the @entity15			0
‘ @entity47 has more than 40 years ’ experience in business , specifically in the areas of technology , human resources and recruitment			0
his contribution to the @entity15 has been extremely valuable			0
business : mr @entity2 , back right , on the hit show @entity185 with the other judges on the panel ‘ @entity47 ’s connection to @entity2 [ through his daughter ] adds an extra level of attention when it comes to supporting @entity2 ’s mission to greatly improve access to vital business skills for young people			1
’ mr @entity79 claims the @entity100 has only £ 270,000 left in the bank and is spending at an average rate of £ 230,000 a month			0
but finance director @entity199 said : ‘ the bank balance changes monthly			0
it is correct that the @entity158 contract and funding has now [ been ] completed but the @entity100 does not have cashflow issues			0
‘ it is well run and the audit of this year ’s accounts will shortly confirm that the foundation is a going concern for a minimum of 12 months			2
