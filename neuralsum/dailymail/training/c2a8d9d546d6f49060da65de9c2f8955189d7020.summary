evidence that a colony of previously unknown flying reptiles lived around a desert lake around 100 million years ago , has been uncovered by scientists			1
@entity5 remains of at least 47 pterosaurs with wingspans ranging from two to eight feet ( 65 to 235cm ) , were discovered at @entity8 do @entity9 in southern @entity10			1
but the huge number of bones could indicate that hundreds of young and adult individuals perished there			1
@entity5 remains of at least 47 pterosaurs with wingspans ranging from two to eight feet ( 65 to 235cm ) , were discovered at @entity8 do @entity9			1
@entity15 had a large bony crest on the top of its head that changed from being small when it was young , to large and steep in adults ( pictured ) it is the first time scientists have located a pterosaur ' bone bed ' containing fossils from many individuals of the same species			1
the site where they were found covers an area of less than 215 square feet ( 20 square metres )			0
the pterosaur @entity32 had a large bony crest on the top of its head that changed from being small when it was young , to large and steep in adults			1
it is thought to have been a gregarious species that learned to fly at a very young age			2
dr @entity40 , from @entity41 , said : ' based on the available information , we conclude that @entity32 lived in colonies around an inland lake situated in a desert			0
it is the first time scientists have located a pterosaur ' bone bed ' containing fossils from many individuals of the same @entity51 found the site at @entity8 do @entity9 ( marked on the map ) in @entity10 @entity32 is a type of previously - unknown pterosaur - ancient flying reptiles			1
its wingspan ranged from two to eight ft ( 56 to 235cm )			0
@entity15 had a large bony crest on the top of its head that changed from being small when it was young , to large and steep in adults			1
it is thought to have been a gregarious species that learned to fly at a very young age			2
experts think the creature lived in colonies - in this case , around a lake in the desert			0
writing in the journal @entity73 , he continued : ' the presence of three main levels of accumulation in a section of less than one metre suggests that this region was home to pterosaur populations for an extended period of time			0
â€˜ it is also plausible that @entity15 was a migratory pterosaur that visited this area from time to time , although the first possibility is favoured here			2
' the causes of death remain unknown , although similarities with dinosaur drought - related mortality are striking			0
' however , it is also possible that desert storms could have been responsible for the occasional demise of these pterosaurs			0
' the fossil record of pterosaurs , which lived alongside the dinosaurs but were unrelated to birds , is patchy			0
their bones were fragile and few of the creatures lived in places where fossils form easily , making pterosaur finds rare			2
most have consisted of incomplete skeletons of a single individual .			0

@entity5 remains of at least 47 pterosaurs with wingspans ranging from two to eight feet ( 65 to 235cm ) , were discovered at @entity8 do @entity9 , @entity10
bones indicate hundreds of young and adult individuals perished there
it *'s* the first time scientists have located a pterosaur ' bone bed '
@entity15 had a large bony crest on the top of its head
the gregarious species lived around 100 million years ago
