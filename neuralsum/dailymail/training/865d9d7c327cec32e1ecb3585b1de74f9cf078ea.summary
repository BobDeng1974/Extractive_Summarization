by @entity0 last tied for the fourth hottest year on record around the globe , it has been revealed			1
the average world temperature was 58.12 degrees ( @entity6 ) tying with 2003 for the fourth warmest since 1880 , the @entity4 said			1
at the same time , @entity8 , which calculates records in a different manner , ranked last year as the seventh warmest on record , with an average temperature of 58.3 degrees ( @entity14 )			1
it is based on differences that are in the hundredths of a degree , scientists said			0
however , both agencies agreed nine of the 10th warmest years on record have happened in the 21st century			2
the difference is related to how the two agencies calculate temperatures in the @entity20 and other remote places and is based on differences that are in the hundredths of a degree , scientists said			0
both agencies said nine of the 10th warmest years on record have happened in the 21st century			2
the hottest year was 2010 , according to @entity4			0
the reports were released as a big snowstorm was hitting the @entity41 @entity40			0
' there are times such as today when we can have snow even in a globally warmed world , ' said @entity47 , deputy director of @entity8 's @entity48 in @entity49			1
' but the long term trends are not going to disappear ... quite frankly people have a very short memory when it comes to climate and weather			0
' those longer trends show the world has seen " fairly dramatic warming " since the 1960s with " a smaller rate of warming over the last decade or so , " said @entity62 , director of @entity4 's @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 in the past 50 years , the world annual temperature has increased by nearly 1.4 degrees ( 0.8 degrees @entity14 ) , according to @entity4 data			1
unlike 2012 , much of the worst heat and biggest climate disasters last year were outside the @entity41 @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 were record warm			2
a record breaking 2013 : warm areas are shown in red in this @entity4 graph showing january Â¿ december 2013 @entity78 and @entity79 in degrees @entity14 only a few places , including the central @entity41 , were cooler than normal last year			1
temperatures that were only the 37th warmest for the nation last year			2
that followed the warmest year on record for the @entity41 last year , the world had 41 billion - dollar weather disasters , the second highest number behind only 2010 , according to insurance firm @entity89 , which tracks global disasters			1
since 2000 , the world has averaged 28 such billion dollar disasters , which are adjusted for inflation			0
@entity8 , which calculates records in a different manner , ranked last year as the seventh warmest on record , with an average temperature of 58.3 degrees ( @entity14 )			1
nearly half of last year 's biggest weather disasters were in @entity100 and the @entity101 , including @entity102 , which killed at least 6,100 people and caused $ 13 billion in damage to the @entity106 and @entity107			0
other costly weather disasters included $ 22 billion from central @entity110 flooding in june , $ 10 billion in damage from @entity112 in @entity113 and @entity114 , and a $ 10 billion drought in much of @entity113 , according to the insurance firm			0
usually the weather event called @entity118 , a warming of the @entity120 , is responsible for boosting already warm years into the world 's hottest years			1
but in 2013 , there was no @entity118			0
the fact that a year with no @entity118 ' was so hot tells me that the climate really is shifting , ' said @entity126 , a @entity127 climate scientist , who was not part of either the @entity4 or @entity8 teams			1
for many people , global warming first hit the headlines in 1988 when @entity8 climate scientist @entity133 testified before @entity134 on a hot summer day			0
that year ended up the warmest on record at the time			2
but today , it was knocked out of the 20 top hottest years by 2013 .			0

average world temperature was 58.12 degrees ( 14.52 *celsius* )
@entity8 , which calculates records in a different manner , ranked last year as the seventh warmest on record
