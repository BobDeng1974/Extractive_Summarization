@entity2 says including only a smaller circle of friends is ‘ divisive and unkind ’ to other pupils			1
a letter from the private mixed preparatory school to parents says its @entity20 ethic is about being inclusive			2
but yesterday critics said his policy would only drive up the cost of children ’s parties			2
mr @entity2 , head of @entity27 in @entity28 , wrote a letter to parents in which he asked : ‘ please could you avoid bringing any party invitations into school that do not include all children in a particular class or year group			1
this goes completely against our policy of inclusion for every single child and is divisive and unkind			1
’ parents criticised the decision , with several using @entity44 to call it ‘ ridiculous ’			2
@entity45 said : ‘ i think children should be allowed to hand out invites and the head teachers should bear in mind that not all parents can afford to invite the whole class – some classes have 20 + in each class			1
’ @entity54 said : ‘ kids should invite their friends in numbers the parents have budgeted for			1
why invite a kid who ’s been harassing you at school all term ? ’ @entity63 added : ‘ most parents do a party on a budget so can not afford to invite all in the class			1
also if you have a theme party you are sometimes limited to a certain number			0
kids have to learn that they ca n’t have everything			0
’ but several parents came to mr @entity2 ’s defence			1
@entity74 said : ‘ he ’s not forcing parents to host 30 + kids , just do n’t hand out the invites at school			0
‘ teaching kids is hard enough without extra drama in the classroom			0
’ yesterday mr @entity2 said he stood by his decision , which was designed to prevent children who are left out feeling upset			2
grand : the @entity27 building , which said that just inviting a few friends to parties in front of others was ' divisive and unkind ' ‘ we consider kindness to be one of the key values of our school , ’ he said			1
‘ what we are saying is that actually handing over party invitations to some of the group in front of people is not the way we would like it to happen			0
99.9 per cent of our parents are in total agreement with that			1
’ he said that if parents wanted to invite just a few of their child ’s friends , they should do it privately , adding : ‘ do it by email , not in a public place where you find one or two or three people are left			1
‘ if children feel like they have been left out by one of the class it can have a serious impact and it is something that does n’t need to happen			0
why choose to exclude in a public context when you do n’t need to ? ’ grand : the entrance to the prep schooll in @entity28 , @entity128 , which costs up to £ 20,000 a year at the school yesterday , parents appeared to back the headmaster ’s stance			0
one , a mother of three who requested not to be named , said : ‘ it is not nice to leave people out			0
‘ i usually invite the whole class until they have really made close friends , but when they are older you just ring the other mums			2
’ a mother of eight - year - old twins said parents understood the rule			0
‘ we just tell the children about the party outside of school			0
it would be too many to invite the whole class			2
’ the school , which costs £ 19,818 a year for boarders and up to £ 10,602 year for day pupils , was opened by @entity152 , the founder of @entity153 , in 1748 for the sons of @entity153 clergymen			0
it has 306 pupils aged three to 11 and ‘ seeks to be a caring community based upon @entity20 principles ’ .			0

in letter , headteacher @entity2 said just inviting a few friends is ' divisive and unkind '
he says that 99.9 per cent of parents are behind his inclusion policy
but some say they can not afford huge parties and *refuse* to invite class bully
