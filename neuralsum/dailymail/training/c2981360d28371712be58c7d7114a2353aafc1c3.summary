by @entity0 @entity2 's first day of training in @entity4 gave an insight into how meticulous @entity7 's preparations to cope with the heat and humidity in @entity10 have stretched			1
several portable @entity12 cool boxes lined the side of the training pitch , with each bearing the names of individual players and containing tailor - made recovery drinks to cater for their different requirements			1
the @entity21 's @entity20 , exercise scientist @entity22 , @entity24 fitness coach @entity23 and @entity26 nutritionist @entity25 have worked with experts from @entity28 to customise recovery drinks with different electrolytes depending on the amount of fluid that that players lose through sweat			1
tailor made : @entity2 staff carry out cool boxes containing personalised recovery drinks for the team @entity4 heat ! @entity2 are training in the @entity40 as part of their preparations to cope with high temperatures in @entity10 form a queue : @entity45 ( @entity46 ) helps @entity2 staff line up the cool boxes while the players train th conditions in @entity4 were hot enough to warrant the use of industrial cooling fans to help the players adapt to what is to come in @entity10			1
temperatures are expected to be in their 30s with humidity at between 80 - 100 per cent when @entity2 face @entity57 in their opening game in @entity59 on june 12 , and how @entity2 cope with those challenging conditions will be crucial to their performance			1
preparations began with warm weather training in @entity64 where players were asked to wear several layers of clothing			1
' we did sweat testing , ' said @entity7			2
' we have a t - shirt , a lightweight training tracksuit and on top of that the wet top			0
take a break : @entity76 takes in some fluids alongside @entity78 on the sidelines lotta bottle : @entity81 takes a sip from his personalised recovery drink at the @entity84 , @entity4 @entity86 work : players will need to keep rehydrated with temperatures in @entity59 expected to top @entity89 ' apparently , it is individual			1
people sweat differently and need different drinks or whatever			0
the players went through today ’s session with sweat pads on and they are being analysed and in terms of the extra heat we tried to generate			2
' because there are going to be uncomfortable moments and you ’ve got to learn to get comfortable with that			0
@entity2 captain , @entity103 , told the @entity104 that the conditions are likely to dictate how the team will play			1
‘ coming from playing every week in @entity2 to a hotter , more humid climate where you ’re sweating more is obviously going to affect the way you play , ’ he said			2
@entity111 laid plans : @entity7 has left no detail to chance in his preparations for the @entity116 no 1 fan : @entity7 and @entity118 stand in front of an industrial cooling fan beside the pitch @entity122 : while players were given individual drinks , it appears the coaches had to contend with water ‘ sprinting for long periods becomes more difficult and you need to take more breaks to breathe and get a sip of a drink to rehydrate			2
you need to place more control on the tempo of the game and ensure you do n’t burn yourself out in the first half			0
‘ each game and opponent requires a different plan , so yes , we will tailor our approach in @entity59 to fit the requirements			0
’ defender @entity143 said : ' the stuff with the sweat tests i have not experienced before			0
it is about ticking all the boxes and put us in the best place we can be , so we are prepared for everything			0
' wrap up warm : @entity2 's preparations began with waring three layers while training in @entity64 pass and move : @entity103 insists that the weather will determine how @entity2 approach different games hot stuff ! increased temperature , heart rate and dehydration are three factors that will affect @entity2 according to @entity161 , a professor of sport science at the @entity163 , three factors will play a part in @entity59 - dehydration , increased temperature and rise in heart rate			1
‘ players could sweat three litres an hour very easily in the heat of humidity of @entity59			2
within half an hour or 45 minutes , they could easily become dehydrated			0
they have to start the game properly hydrated , they have to hydrate during the game			0
‘ what happens when you sweat is you do n’t just lose fluid , you lose electrolytes – and it ’s those electrolytes , the sodium or the salt particularly within the body which help the muscles and the nerves function effectively – if you lose too many of them your performance can suffer			0
