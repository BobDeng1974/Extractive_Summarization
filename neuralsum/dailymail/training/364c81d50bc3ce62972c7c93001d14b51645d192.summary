a baffled coroner has ruled that a man who burned to death in his home died as a result of spontaneous human combustion			1
dr @entity6 , the coroner for @entity7 in @entity8 , said that although @entity10 , 76 , had been found lying on his back close to a fire in an open fireplace , that blaze had not caused his death			1
he said a detailed investigation into all other possibilities had offered no other explanation , so he was delivering such a verdict for the first time in his 25 years as a coroner			1
death : the home in @entity23 , @entity7 , where @entity10 spontaneously combusted in his sitting room it is believed to be the first case of its kind in @entity8 , although a number of unexplained cases are reported each year around the world			1
the term spontaneous human combustion ( @entity34 ) describes alleged cases of the burning of a living human body without an apparent external source of ignition			1
mr @entity10 , of @entity23 , @entity7 , died on 22 december 2010			1
the inquest was told that forensic experts were certain that a fire in the fireplace of the sitting room where the badly burnt body was found had not been the cause of the blaze that killed him			2
wife @entity49 , right , arrives at @entity50 today with assistant chief fire office @entity51 there had been no trace of an accelerant , such as petrol or alcohol , and there had been nothing to suggest foul play			2
there have been a number of documented cases where police have found corpses burned almost to ashes but no burned furniture around @entity68 of 3,000 degrees would be required to burn a human body to this extent , yet in these cases only smoke damage is reported.puzzled scientists have come up with the ‘ wick theory ’ to explain such events			2
the theory is that the human body can become an ‘ inside out ’ candle.the person ’s clothes are the wick , while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance , that keeps the blaze going			2
limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient , with the bottom half of the bodybeing cooler than the @entity88 grisly aside is that greasy stains left after such an event could be a residue for the person ’s body @entity93 combustion would not be ‘ spontaneous ’ however , because it would need an external source to start it off , such as a cigarette			2
some have postulated that static electricity could cause the needed @entity102 pathologist professor @entity101 told the @entity103 in 2005 : ‘ the way the body burns - the so - called wick effect - seems to me and to my colleagues to be the most scientifically credible hypothesis			2
’ a body would take around five hours to burn in this way to ashes			2
victims are often elderly , sick , or under the influence of alcohol , which might explain why they would not have been able to escape			0
while his body was totally destroyed by fire , it had not spread and the only minor damage in the sitting room was to the ceiling above him and the floor beneath him			1
dr @entity6 said he had consulted medical textbooks and carried out other research in an attempt to find an explanation			0
' this fire was thoroughly investigated and i 'm left with the conclusion that this fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion , for which there is no adequate explanation , ' he said			0
mr @entity10 's daughter @entity136 said her family was satisfied with the investigation and they accepted the inquest 's findings			1
however , she added : ' unfortunately , it does n't provide us with any real explanation			0
' claims about @entity34 have been made for centuries			0
the gin - drinking character @entity147 the alcoholic in the @entity150 novel @entity151 is said to spontaneously combust			1
relatives of a @entity154 woman who died in 1982 said they saw her burst into flames in her north @entity157 home but coroner dr @entity158 said there was ' no such thing ' as @entity34 and recorded an open verdict			1
the human body is mostly water and its only properties which burn readily are fat tissue and methane gas			0
temperatures of nearly @entity168 are required to reduce a body to near ashes			0
many experts believe there is no such thing as @entity34			0
retired professor of pathology @entity101 said he believed there always had to be some source of ignition , such as a lit match or cigarette			0
' there is a source of ignition somewhere , but because the body is so badly destroyed the source ca n't be found , ' he said			0
he said the circumstances in the @entity7 case were very similar to other possible cases			1
truth stranger than fiction : an illustration from @entity150 ' @entity151 of the moment @entity147 dies from spontaneous combustion - the fate which befell @entity10 in @entity7 ' this is the picture which is described time and time again , ' he said			1
mr @entity101 said he doubted explanations centred on divine intervention			0
' i think if the heavens were striking in cases of spontaneous combustion then there would be a lot more cases			0
i go for the practical , the mundane explanation , ' he said .			0
