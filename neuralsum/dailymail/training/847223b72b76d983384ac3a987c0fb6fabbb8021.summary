by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 sir @entity3 has blamed a lack of ' trust ' between him and fellow @entity8 winner @entity7 after he was dropped from this year 's race			1
the @entity8 will roll through the @entity13 gold medallist 's home @entity10 for the first time in seven years next month - but he will not be taking part			1
instead the cyclist said @entity17 is rallying round his teammate @entity7 , who won last year 's tour and who he has not raced with all year			1
the pair have not raced together all year and sir @entity3 said he was ' gutted ' criticism : the admission came a day after @entity7 said he sensed metal weakness in sir @entity3 during his 2012 triumph ( pictured )			1
he was the first @entity29 to win the @entity8 - but was followed by @entity7 last year yesterday @entity17 insisted a final decision on team selection would not be made until the end of this month - but sir @entity3 broke ranks , saying his future there could be in doubt			1
he told the @entity37 : ' the team is focused around @entity7 ... i am gutted			2
i 've worked extremely hard for this all winter and i feel i am in the form i was two years ago			0
now if i want to go to the @entity8 again , the reality is that i might have to go elsewhere			0
' however , he added : ' i also understand that cycling is a team sport and it is all about @entity17 winning and @entity7 is defending champion			1
' he said @entity7 had a strong group of riders behind him , some of whom were good enough to win the race themselves			2
‘ for the dynamic of the team , @entity7 has a say and we have n’t raced together all year , ' he said			2
' when you ’re in the heat of the moment , you need guys you can trust and who have been there for you			0
tensions can rise between two riders			0
' tension : @entity7 ( left ) and sir @entity3 ( centre ) fell out during the @entity8 , with several public spats tension : the pair together last year			1
both are among the most successful team cyclists in @entity74 history sources close to the pair say the atmosphere is ‘ dreadful ’ when they are together , with @entity7 , 29 , sometimes ‘ intimidated ’ by a colleague of 34 - year - old @entity79 ’s stature			1
the riders were involved in public spats after the @entity8 , though they said they had cleared the air and resolved their differences at a training camp last year			0
with his contract expiring this year , sir @entity3 said he is considering his future at @entity17 having ‘ spoken to a few people ’ linked to rival teams			1
‘ having missed the @entity8 again this year , i would n’t like to leave it there , ’ said sir @entity3 , who also has his sights on a return to the track for the @entity92 in @entity93			1
' i ’d love to go back at some point so there is the chance that i would go back to the @entity8 next year			0
claims : @entity7 said he sensed mental weakness in his teammate during his 2012 @entity8 win ( pictured ) skilled : sir @entity3 said @entity7 ( pictured ) had a good team around him and accepted it was a team sport he said he had spoken to the @entity105 team about joining them next season			1
the @entity8 will be in @entity74 for three days from july 5 , starting in @entity108 and whisking through @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			2
sir @entity3 's comments came a day after @entity7 claimed he had sensed ' mental weakness ' in his teammate during the @entity8			1
asked whether the comments angered him , sir @entity3 told the @entity37 : ' no , not really			2
books get written all the time in this day and age and there seems to be a different book out every week			0
it 's two years ago now			0
' but he added : ' one of the things with the @entity8 is you 're on the road for one month with a group of guys and you 're going to have different emotions , different mood swings			0
home soil : the @entity131 will kick off in @entity132 next month , where @entity7 is pictured training ' a friend of mine from the rugby world said " i could do it for 90 minutes , i could n't do it for four weeks " , and i think that summed it up for me			0
' a senior figure in cycling , who asked to remain anonymous , said : ‘ if @entity146 does n’t ride it will be a disaster for the sport in this country			0
' here was a chance to showcase the sport here in @entity151 with the last two winners of the @entity8 , who are both @entity74			2
' but because they do n’t get on , the one who ’s most popular with the fans is not going to be there			0
