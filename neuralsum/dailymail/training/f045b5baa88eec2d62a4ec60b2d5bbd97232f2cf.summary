the departure of the @entity0 caused real concern			2
the decision by his old gaffer to walk away then definitely started the alarm bells ringing			2
when former team - mate @entity8 decided he could no longer serve under the current board , @entity10 became convinced that all hope was lost			1
‘ imagine @entity14 at @entity15 saying : “ you know what ? i ’ve had enough of the club ” , ’ said the former @entity13 midfielder			1
‘ then sir @entity19 departing because something was going on — and then @entity21 leaving			2
if that happened at @entity15 , imagine how everyone would react			2
they ’d be asking : “ what is going on ? ”			2
@entity27 fans display a ' @entity29 ' banner after continuing their pre-match protests on friday @entity10 , who played for @entity27 from 1991 - 1998 , fears for the club since @entity8 departed @entity33 reportedly attempted to get security over @entity27 ' stadium and training ground ‘ at @entity27 , we ’ve had @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 walking out			1
that ’s what would worry me			0
what is going on in there ? ‘ yeah , football is a business now			0
but is there anybody in there actually doing it for the sake of the club ? ‘ or are they just in to make a few quid then disappear into the night ? over the past few years , that has been the case			0
‘ @entity40 stayed away , which for me is hard to get my head round			0
@entity38 left the board and , again , alarm bells started ringing			1
if @entity38 is walking away when you need somebody there , it must be bad			0
you know that , for him to go , he must have had his reasons			0
@entity8 , on the touchline as @entity27 manager , left the role in december after three years in charge ‘ for @entity40 not to be there means stuff must be going on that people ca n’t quite see			1
obviously , the great @entity70 passed away , unfortunately			0
and now @entity39 is away			0
so there are four great @entity27 men who have departed the club			1
’ @entity10 is , like all with @entity27 at heart , greatly saddened by the continued struggles of a club gifted tens of millions of pounds by supporters who believed in ‘ the journey ’ from a starting point at the bottom of the senior game			1
like anyone with an interest in or knowledge of football as a business , he remains suspicious of the moves and motives that have led @entity27 to the brink of insolvency			1
the @entity27 board considered mortgaging off @entity13 in return for a £ 10million loan from @entity33 ‘ @entity27 are possibly in an even worse state now than they were when they went down to the bottom tier , ’ he said			1
‘ what has gone on off the park at @entity27 for the last three years , as a supporter , player , manager or part of the coaching staff — i speak to the coaching staff — you just do n’t know what is going to happen next or who you can trust			1
‘ a new guy comes in and it ’s : “ oh yeah , great , he ’s going to put money in			0
then that falls flat and somebody else goes in , all while there is money going out of the club			0
‘ there has been a whole load of mismanagement off the park , i think that ’s plain for everyone to see			0
‘ listen , i think @entity27 going into administration and going down to the bottom tier was a boot in the b * * * s. a big setback			1
@entity133 ( right ) during the clash with @entity135 on friday , which had to be abandoned due to adverse weather @entity27 fans protest before friday 's match with @entity135 over claims that @entity13 is to be mortgaged off @entity27 fans stormed an entrance at @entity13 to voice their feelings against the board on friday night one of the supporter 's flags read : ' @entity27 supported by fans , directed by parasites ' ‘ but even then people thought : “ right , they ’ve bottomed out , they can build again , build up ”			1
and it ’s just not happened			0
‘ people could n’t believe @entity27 were getting 45,000 or whatever against @entity152 and the like			1
so the support stood by them and remained steadfast as they rolled through the bottom two divisions			0
‘ but , when you get to this stage , you have to be ready for it			0
if the club had been managed properly , they would have been able to go back into the top flight and be stronger			0
‘ it ’s just been one calamity after another			0
people coming in , then leaving			0
i think the fans put in about £ 20million — and now they need so many million just to survive			2
‘ not just @entity27 fans , any fan of football would be asking : “ how can that be so ? where has that money gone ? ”			1
those fans are now in open revolt against the current regime , with elements of friday night ’s demonstration outside @entity13 turning violent as some tried to gain access to club offices			1
@entity178 has called a general meeting to ask @entity27 shareholders to rout the entire @entity13 board on friday @entity10 said : ‘ i think the other night was just everything coming to a head			1
that ’s why there was such a big demonstration			0
‘ obviously , you do n’t condone any violence , although i do n’t think there was much of that , to be fair			0
‘ the thing that really brought it to a head was finding out the ground was going to be put up as security on a loan , the board having told everyone at the last agm that this would never happen			2
the fans have had enough			2
‘ i think the fans would come back , no doubt			2
i do n’t think there is a case of generations of fans being lost			2
police and stewards hold people back as @entity135 and @entity27 fans attempt to confront each other inside @entity13 ‘ they went to the fourth tier and still got 45,000 fans , 30,000 in the third tier			1
@entity27 have fans across the world and are a huge brand , even though people do n’t perceive that just now			1
‘ it would be a silly thing to say just now , but they still have support across the world			0
it goes hand in hand , it also needs to be done on the park			0
‘ there is no reason that @entity27 ca n’t be playing top flight next year			1
if they get there , will more money be ploughed into the club ? would more investors be interested ? ‘ i ’m sure there would be and supporters wo n’t turn their backs on @entity27			1
there are people there who will always be there			0
’ although @entity10 feels promotion is a possibility , he accepts that it will have to come via the play - offs			1
and that ’s assuming the emergency sale of @entity245 to @entity246 is the last cut - price departure during this transfer window			0
with one eye on the @entity252 semi-final to come , the former @entity250 midfielder said : ‘ no disrespect to @entity246 because they are flying in the @entity255 , but it shows how far @entity27 have slipped			1
‘ looking to the game with @entity257 , @entity27 can not afford to lose any more players before then , that is for sure			2

fans protested against the @entity13 board before and after @entity135 match
clash with @entity255 *leaders* called off due to adverse weather
supporters stormed an entrance on friday at @entity13 to voice their feelings
