@entity0 has refused to close the accounts of @entity3 rioters who used the service to spread unrest and insisted that @entity6 must ' continue to flow '			1
the @entity8 - based company said that ' freedom of expression ' was essential and that information would be ' kept flowing '			1
social networks have faced criticism for allowing rioters and looters to incite violence and public disorder across the country since riots began last saturday in @entity19			1
@entity0 and @entity20 were used by rioters and police have signaled that they will trawl people 's accounts to find offenders			1
targeted : government spooks will track to the riot ringleaders ' mobile phones to hunt down those responsible for the organising the violence but @entity0 refused to take their own action against offenders			1
a spokesman told the @entity34 that a blog post on the issue earlier this year was still relevant			2
eight people in @entity38 had been arrested on suspicion of encouraging rioting via social media			1
a 20 - year - old man from @entity42 has been charged with intentionally encouraging the commissioning of an offence and is due to appear before magistrates			2
a 13 - year - old boy from @entity47 was released on police bail pending further inquiries			1
two 22 - year - old men from @entity47 , a 23 - year - old man from @entity52 and a 24 - year - old man from @entity54 continue to be questioned			2
two other males , both from @entity47 and aged 17 and 18 , were released without charge			2
' our goal is to instantly connect people everywhere to what is most meaningful to them			2
for this to happen , freedom of expression is essential , ' it says			0
' some tweets may facilitate positive change in a repressed country , some make us laugh , some make us think , some downright anger a vast majority of users			0
we do n't always agree with the things people choose to tweet , but we keep the information flowing irrespective of any view we may have about the content			1
' the revalation came as @entity80 spies have been drafted in to track riot ringleaders who have been using encrypted instant messages on their @entity20 smartphones to avoid detection			1
experts at the @entity87 listening station in @entity88 have joined forces with @entity90 to hunt down hundreds of criminals suspected of masterminding some of the worst looting			0
they are tracking communications over the internet and mobile phones that organised the mass rioting			0
the development came as calls grew for the service to be shut down after it played a key role in helping mobilise looters involved in the riots across @entity3			0
@entity103 , a technology journalist and digital adviser to @entity105 , said it was ' unbelievable ' that the @entity20 service had not been disabled			0
looter : pictures put on @entity0 showed some of the rioters using shopping trolleys to carry away stolen items including tvs and mobile phones messages on the service , along with posts on @entity0 , helped spread the locations of riots like wildfire and brought hordes of teenagers together to attack neighbourhoods throughout the weekend			1
however , there are difficulties intercepting the instant and virtually untraceable messages sent via @entity20 , known as @entity20 , to private networks of one or more people			1
unlike social networks such as @entity132 and @entity0 , messages sent through @entity20 can not be traced back to the sender			1
they are also encrypted , adding to the handset ’s popularity among security - conscious business chiefs and criminals alike			0
mr @entity103 described the @entity20 service as ' text messaging with steroids ' , as @entity142 itself denied reports it had planned to disable the messenging service			0
mr @entity103 had tweeted last night : ' it is unbelievable that @ @entity147 is not shutting down @entity20 right now			0
' he told the @entity149 programme this morning : ' mobile phones have become weaponised in their capability of spreading information about where to target next			1
intercepted : @entity87 employs some of the most skilled experts in intercepting messages and they may be able to recover information from phones ' there is evidence that @entity20 is an encrypted , very secure , safe , fast , cheap , easy way for disaffected urban youths to spread messages for their next target			1
' it 's like text messaging with steroids - you can send messages to hundreds of people and once it 's gone from your phone it can not be traced back to you			1
' @entity87 was brought in to trace the messages after senior officials designated bringing rioters to justice a ‘ national priority ’			1
@entity179 sources said ‘ several hundred ’ ringleaders had already been identified by police intelligence staff			2
‘ many of these people are part of organised criminal gangs , ’ said an official			0
‘ we know who they are and we can see who else they are talking to			0
we are using all the resources at our disposal			0
this is a national priority			0
’ asked if @entity87 was involved , a @entity196 official added : ‘ all the usual sources are being used to make sure the police have the information they need			1
the idea is to round these people up and publicise who they are			0
we want to arrest them or spook them into staying off the streets			0
’ @entity87 employs some of the world ’s most skilled experts in intercepting and recovering electronic communications			0
police technical experts may also be able to recover incriminating information from the mobile phones – even the @entity210 – of suspects			1
this could include a record of their messages as well as photographs and internet searches			2
it is also possible undercover agents may have been able to infiltrate message networks			2
@entity220 , the firm behind the @entity20 , said it would ‘ engage with the authorities ’			0
this brought threats from hackers against the company			0
deputy assistant commissioner @entity226 , of the @entity227 , said : ‘ a lot of people who are seeing these @entity20 messages are forwarding them to the police			1
’ a @entity20 spokesman suggested that the company may help police trace those responsible for stirring up violence			2
he said : ‘ we feel for those impacted by the riots in @entity3			0
we have engaged with the authorities to assist in any way we can			0

police will trawl accounts to find offenders
@entity0 and other social networks face criticism
messages on @entity0 spread information among rioters
