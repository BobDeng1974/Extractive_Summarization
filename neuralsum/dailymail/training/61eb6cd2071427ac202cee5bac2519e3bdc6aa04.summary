by @entity1 reporter published : 06:09 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 06:54 est , 9 october 2012 a family has had an emotional reunion with their cat six years after it left the house			0
@entity7 and @entity8 had all but given up on their black and white pet , @entity11 , who was nine when he left the house in @entity12 , @entity13 , in 2006			1
however , mrs @entity14 spotted the cat when she was out walking and was able to verify that it was @entity11 thanks to a microchip that had been fitted to him			1
remarkable : @entity14 poses with her cat , @entity11 , who has been found after going missing six years ago when he first went missing the family put up ' lost ' posters and contacted nearby vets ' surgeries , but to no avail			1
but then mrs @entity14 spotted the family pet and took him to an animal shelter where she works to carry out tests on his microchip			2
the tiny electronic identification tag confirmed this was her @entity11 , who she had cared for since he was seven weeks old			1
the couple have moved more than two miles away since @entity11 vanished and mrs @entity14 was only back in @entity35 to view a property for her mother			1
she said : ' my mum , sister and i were looking at a place close to the house @entity43 and i lived in when @entity11 went missing			1
off again ? mrs @entity14 says she is scared to let @entity11 out of the house in case he runs away again ' if it was n’t for the bungalow my mum , sister and i were looking at , we would n’t have been around there			1
' when we saw this cat on a wall outside a house i was immediately 99.9 per cent sure it was @entity11			1
' he was a lot skinnier but came straight over to me and responded to his name			0
' we went and spoke to the man who lived there and he told me he had been feeding @entity11 for about two and a half years			1
' i ’m over the moon to have him back			0
we shed a few tears when the microchip test worked			0
' mrs @entity14 , a receptionist , says she ’s so happy to have @entity11 , now 16 , back that she ’s scared to let him out of the house			1
she added : ' i was shocked to start with that i had even come across him			0
' we had always been left wondering what had happened to him			0
since you 've been gone : @entity7 and @entity8 have moved house and had twins since the 16 - year - old cat went missing in 2006 ' when he went missing we did all the usual things like going out looking for him , posting leaflets and contacting vets , but there was nothing			1
' @entity11 had always been quite a friendly cat			2
when we lived in @entity35 he would often go down to the nearby stables where they would feed him			0
' so it ’s no surprise he found someone to look after him in the intervening years			0
' a lot has changed in the household since @entity11 disappeared in 2006			1
engineer mr @entity8 , 38 , and mrs @entity14 now have 13 month old twins , @entity82 and @entity83			2
they already had two other cats and two dogs , which @entity11 has been reintroduced to after being found last thursday			2
returned : @entity11 was identified when mrs @entity14 checked his microchip tag he is eating well and using his litter tray , but has n’t met their new cat and dog , mrs @entity14 said			2
she added : ' @entity11 seems quite content and is slowly getting back into life here			2
' we have n’t let him out again so far			0
we will eventually , but i do n’t know when i ’ll be brave enough			0
' he ’s got the meow of an older cat now and you can tell he ’s grown up into an older boy			0
' he ’s settling back in and does n’t seem too fazed by the children			0
