@entity7 ( @entity8 ) @entity0 completed the week of his life with victory in the @entity12 @entity11 on a day when @entity4 produced a backs - to - the - wall drive to limit the damage to his team - mate and title rival			1
from 20th on the grid at @entity20 , following a qualifying crash and five - place grid penalty for a gearbox change due to the damage sustained , 29 - year - old @entity4 was third in his mercedes behind @entity3 ' @entity2			1
@entity0 's triumph was the first for @entity1 on home soil since 1954 , with five - times champion @entity28 taking the chequered flag that day			1
all the action unfolded behind him , with the spotlight on @entity4 given his lowly grid position in the wake of a smash in the first part of qualifying following a front - right brake disc failure			1
initally 15th for the start , @entity1 announced the gearbox change and subsequent penalty on sunday morning ahead of the race , leaving him down in 20th and with a mountain to climb to even clamber onto the podium			2
but @entity4 produced a rousing performance , limiting the damage as best as possible with third , with the gap to @entity0 now 14 points			1
over the opening laps it was captivating stuff from @entity62 , the kind of situation on which he loves and thrives			0
happy : @entity0 accepts the admiration of the @entity12 fans as @entity4 rubs his eyes ( right ) in the lead : the @entity1 driver celebrates winning the @entity12 @entity11 catch me if you can : @entity0 led the way after starting in pole position in @entity20 well done : @entity0 embraces @entity76 ( right ) after winning the @entity12 @entity11 in @entity20 1			1
@entity1 - 366 pts 2			0
@entity6 - 188 pts 3			0
@entity3 - 121 pts 4			0
@entity8 - 116 pts 5			0
@entity79 - 98 pts just 10 seconds into the race he received one helping hand when , for the second consecutive race , @entity3 ' @entity83 was involved in an accident that brought his grand prix to a swift conclusion			1
unlike at the @entity93 @entity11 when @entity83 was taken out following an horrific smash involving @entity95 , on this occasion his turn into @entity91 's @entity90 resulted in his own shock moment			1
the @entity97 was flipped up and over , landing on the roll hoop on top of his car , which then somehow managed to right itself again			2
it immediately brought the safety car into play for two laps , with @entity62 17th upon its release , following which he can began the process of picking off those ahead of him			0
by the end of lap 10 @entity4 was in the points in 10th , albeit with one moment of consternation , while former friend @entity115 in his @entity116 ran into the sidepod of the @entity118 's @entity1 , but without damage			1
then on lap 13 came a breathtaking overtake on @entity95 and the @entity6 of @entity121 into the hairpin , with the @entity123 squeezed as @entity4 legally edged him out of the way			2
out : @entity83 crashed in the first curve of the @entity12 @entity126 in @entity20 @entity127 : the high - speed crash saw @entity83 's car flipped upside down with pit stops , by the end of lap 16 @entity4 was up to second and 7.7 seconds adrift of @entity0 , who had already made his first stop			1
it was another 10 laps before @entity4 finally made his run into the pits , taking on another set of soft @entity139 tyres - he was one of only three drivers to start off on the harder of the two compounds this weekend			2
that dropped @entity4 back to eighth , but from there he began another charge , although there was again contact at one point , this time with former @entity91 team - mate @entity148			2
it proved slightly more costly as @entity4 lost his left front - wing endplate , exposing his left - front tyre to degradation			2
it forced @entity1 into switching @entity4 from a planned two - stop strategy to a three , at that stage potentially scuppering his hopes of finishing runner - up to @entity0			1
relief : the @entity97 seemed to be ok after the heavy collision with @entity90 heat of the moment : @entity162 was forced out of the race as his car burst into flames trouble behind : @entity0 leads the way as @entity83 crashes at the first corner it was not long before @entity4 was back up to second as those ahead pitted prior to the @entity118 switching to the far quicker supersoft tyres on lap 42 , dropping him to fifth			1
when @entity115 spun his @entity116 on lap 50 , leaving his car on the start - finish straight , it appeared a safety car would be called			0
@entity1 , perhaps expecting as such , immediately brought in @entity62 for a longer - than - planned run on a final set of supersofts			0
speed : @entity4 drives during the @entity12 @entity11 at the @entity20 famous faces : @entity181 ( left ) chats with @entity36 winner @entity182 it was not long before he was on the tail of @entity2 , on fading soft - compound tyres , but as his own rubber in turn lost its initial pace so it became apparent he would be unable to pass , settling for third			1
behind the lead trio were two other world champions in @entity5 in his @entity6 and @entity8 's @entity7 , who endured a titanic struggle with the second @entity6 of @entity121 over the closing stages , just holding sway			0
@entity79 's @entity196 was seventh , followed by @entity91 duo @entity148 and @entity90 , with @entity197 in his @entity79 completing the top 10			1
a thrilled @entity0 said : ' it 's fantastic			1
' it 's an amazing feeling to win at home			0
it 's a very special day			0
' fan : the @entity205 striker poses for a ' selfie ' as the @entity12 @entity11 gets underway second : @entity3 driver @entity2 ( left ) celebrates with a swig of champagne on the podium as for @entity4 , he was obviously delighted after claiming only his second podium finish from outside the top 10 when he was also third in @entity97 in 2009 after starting 17th			1
' i had great fun , ' said @entity4			0
' i did as good as i could			0
' it was hard to get through the pack safely and i had a little bit of a collision with @entity148			0
' i thought he was going to open the door , which he has done a couple of times lately , but that was my bad judgement			0
' it was hard to overtake so i 'm glad to get some points today ( sunday )			0
' fright : @entity226 of @entity227 and @entity228 jumps out of his car after it caught fire all over ? @entity4 did brilliantly to finish third but did n't look too pleased on the podium			2

@entity0 wins @entity12 @entity11 to extend @entity234 lead
@entity83 collides with @entity90 on first corner to put an end to @entity97 's race
@entity4 *battled* from 20th on the grid to finish third
