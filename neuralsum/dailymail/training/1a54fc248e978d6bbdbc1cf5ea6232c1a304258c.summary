women in a small @entity2 town have been revealed as the worst learner drivers in the country			0
five female drivers in @entity6 , @entity2 - which has a population of about 17,000 people - have taken a staggering 158 practical driving tests between them			1
the unnamed women , aged between 35 and 48 , have forked out almost £ 10,000 trying to pass - placing them among the top 20 worst learner drivers in the @entity13			1
one determined woman in the town took 34 attempts to succeed , while two unnamed learners took 32 tests			2
watch out : the @entity2 town of @entity6 is home to some of the worst learners in the country ¿ all of them women the other two women struggled through 29 practical driving tests before passing on their 30th attempts , according to figures revealed by a @entity30 request to the @entity31 ( @entity31 )			1
it is believed this could be due to @entity6 's narrow , rural roads , bad surfaces and busy junctions - although local driving instructors have refused to comment			1
driving test routes in the area also feature the notorious @entity40 , deemed the most dangerous roundabout in @entity2			2
the small town has an extremely low driving pass rate of 39.8 per cent - more than seven per cent below the national average of 47.1 per cent			1
and it would appear female learners are mostly to blame - with only 35.3 per cent of women in the town passing the practical test , compared to 45.7 per cent of men			2
the practical driving test , lasting about 40 minutes , costs £ 62 to take on a weekday or £ 75 on an evening , weekend or bank holiday			2
@entity54 , head of @entity55 , said : ' it seems unusual that @entity6 has proved so troublesome for these learners , but there are many factors that can influence someone 's success at their driving test			1
' in particular , nerves can play a big part in how well someone performs , which may well be the case for those who have made serial attempts			0
' according to the data , three of the top 20 worst learner drivers in the country took their tests in @entity74 - less than eight miles from @entity6			1
and two women took a whopping 69 attempts between them in @entity77			0
failure figures : one woman in the town took 34 driving tests , and two other learners took 32 the record number of practical driving tests was held by a determined 40 - year - old , who was deemed fit to drive on his 37th attempt			1
the unnamed man , from @entity88 , forked out at least £ 2,294 trying to pass - which could have paid for a decent second - hand car			2
meanwhile , a young woman has recently set a new record for flunking the driving theory @entity94 unnamed 28 - year - old , from @entity95 , has sat the test 110 times - spending a staggering £ 3,410 trying to pass			1
the test , costing £ 31 a time , includes a 57 - minute multiple - choice exam and a hazard perception element			0
it is unknown whether the determined @entity95 managed to pass on her 110th attempt - but , either way , she still has the practical test to overcome			0
and it 's not just ordinary people who struggle to gain a driving licence			1
infamous learner @entity108 , from the @entity107 's @entity55 , passed on her seventh attempt , while @entity110 claimed to have taken 19 attempts to succeed because of his battle with the booze			0
the @entity31 says , on average , it takes about 45 hours of professional training and 22 hours of private practice to pass the practical driving test			2
a @entity31 spokesman said : ' pass rates can be influenced by various factors			0
' some people may take more lessons and be better prepared for the test			0
' statistical factors can also play a part as the number of tests conducted at different test centres varies significantly			0
' however , every driving test is conducted to the same strict requirements			0
' we train examiners to a high standard and closely monitor their work to ensure that all tests are assessed consistently across the country			0

apart from hilly roads , there is nothing *obvious* about the driving conditions in @entity6 to *explain* why so many learners struggle to pass
five *residents* are among the top 20 least successful learners in the @entity13
