a mother who said she was told to have an abortion three times has described her relief after she gave birth to a healthy girl			1
@entity6 , 28 , said a doctor told her there was only a one five five chance her baby would survive when she had her three - month scan at @entity11 , @entity12			1
they added that even if the baby did survive they would be severely disabled			1
relief : @entity17 with her daughter @entity18 who has no health problems however the distraught mother refused to give up on her unborn child and sought a second opinion			2
she then had to endure an agonising five - week wait before a second scan gave her baby the all - clear			1
@entity6 gave birth to @entity18 , who was fit and healthy and weighed 5lbs 4oz , six months ago			1
ms @entity6 said : ' if i had listened to them i would not have my beautiful baby girl			1
if i had a termination @entity18 would not be here and my six - year - old son @entity32 would not have the little sister he wanted			2
carrie with her daughter @entity18 and son @entity32			2
@entity36 said the mother 's complaint was partly upheld ' i was told three times to have an abortion			0
they said there was only a 20 per cent chance when i gave birth she would still be alive and she had a cystic hygroma , a growth on the neck			0
' if the baby had survived she was told it would have @entity53 's syndrome , @entity55 's syndrome or a chromosome deficiency			1
the mother - of - two from @entity11 said : ' they did not tell me anything			0
they gave me no help or information			0
' it was the worst five weeks of my life			1
it was like having a ticking time bomb inside me knowing her heart might just stop			0
i was crying all the time and was off work for weeks			2
' instead of following the doctor 's advice she did her own research			0
she went to see another consultant who said she should see professor @entity76			0
it was then professor @entity78 who realised his colleague had made an error			0
ms @entity6 said : ' professor @entity76 was brilliant and i can not fault him			1
he told me there was nothing wrong			0
' she complained to @entity11 and on july 11 received a letter telling her the clinician who misread the scan no longer worked there			2
@entity11 , @entity12 where a doctor misread ms @entity6 ' scan a spokesman for @entity11 said : ' we are grateful for miss @entity6 ' kind comments about professor @entity76 but are sorry she was disappointed with some aspects of her care			1
' we carried out a detailed investigation after she made a formal complaint			0
the complaint was partly , but not wholly , upheld			0
' where appropriate the trust has apologised to @entity102 and , in addition , an individual clinician has apologised to her in writing			0
' in the letter the hospital claimed it had told @entity6 there was a 50/50 chance of an abnormality and disagree with what she said she was told about the chances of a miscarriage .			1
