we 've seen some odd flavours of ice cream recently			1
there 's been olive oil from @entity5 , watercress delight from @entity7 , and even a brussel sprout offering from @entity11 restaurant @entity9			0
but @entity12 has been beaten once again in the food stakes by the @entity14			0
a few months ago @entity15 reported one @entity17 restaurant was serving a menu seasoned with fresh dirt			0
and now , @entity21 's @entity20 is serving a line of three ice creams modelled on breeds of small bird - java sparrow , parakeet and cockatiel			1
would you try some bird flavoured ice cream ? one @entity14 cafe thinks you should served at the @entity33 in the @entity34 , @entity32 sees visitors flock to be surrounded by 36 pet birds in their unique space			1
the cafe say they use all natural ingredients which cost ' a little more than normal ice cream ingredients ' to make their wacky dairy treats			1
they were using the expo as a test run to see if the ice cream would sell well enough to recoup the costs , according to @entity46			2
if successful these ice creams would be sold at their shop in @entity21 and through delivery			0
@entity32 initially announced : ' once in your mouth , the aroma of a parakeet would spread intensely			0
' if you 're wondering how exactly the cafe found out what these cute birds taste like ... read on for a run down of the three flavours			2
the java sparrow is a small chubby bird which feeds on grains and seeds			0
in that spirit , you are treated to vanilla ice cream with grains mixed in			2
as the ice cream melts in your mouth you might feel something squishy rolling around , just like a java sparrow on your tongue			2
that would be the marshmallows hidden inside			0
according to @entity74 : ' it ’s the feeling of pressing the breast of a java sparrow into your mouth			0
' perhaps you could enjoy this tasty treat with your pet bird ? the cafe has n't confirmed it fit for bird consumption parakeets are known to be more lively and active birds and as such the mellow taste of the java sparrow ice cream is jazzed up with some honey and apple			1
there are still some grains mixed in , but to a lesser extent			0
as @entity32 put it , ' it ’s like eating some vanilla ice cream in one hand and then taking a whiff of a parakeet in your other hand			1
' @entity99 ice cream remains lively with the taste of honey - apple , but rather than grains , is mixed with larger pumpkin and sunflower seeds			1
the effect is a rumbling and bouncy taste which , in the words of @entity74 , is like ' when you ’re sleeping with your mouth open and your cockatiel runs over your face and gets its leg in your mouth			2
' @entity99 ( l ) and parakeet ( r ) and two flavours offered up at the @entity33 in @entity14 java sparrow , parakeet and cockatiel are three flavours that could be sold through @entity32 's shop in @entity21			1
