she 's famous for her down - to - earth approach and as these pictures reveal , that even extends to getting her caffeine fix			2
as the @entity6 got underway , the princess royal was spotted mingling with the crowds before stopping to pick up a coffee - and a side - order of friendly chat			1
dressed in one of her trademark hats , the 64 - year - old royal looked on cheerful form as she chatted away to stall holders			2
can you make a lah - te ? princess @entity16 places her order and enjoys a chat with the stall holders later , she was seen clutching a pretty bunch of pink roses given to her by a well - wisher as she toured the equestrian event , which are being held on her @entity24 , and watched the action unfold			1
although no longer riding competitively herself , the princess royal is famous for her love of all things equestrian - a trait passed down to her @entity32 silver medal winning daughter @entity33			1
she has also spoken out about the ill - treatment of horses in the @entity36 , even , at one point , controversially calling for people to eat horse meat in a bid to ensure that the animals always have a value and are never abandoned by their owners			2
the princess , of whom the @entity45 once famously said ' if it does n’t fart or eat hay , she is n’t interested ' , also owns several horses of her own , including a rescue pony			2
watching the action : suitably fortified , princess @entity16 joined husband @entity50 to watch the action unfold thank you ! princess @entity16 wanders through the @entity54 grounds clutching a bunch of roses @entity58 the @entity57 had been badly neglected before being taken in by @entity59 four years ago and was later given a fairytale ending when she was adopted by the royal			1
now living on the @entity24 , the 15 - year - old mare spends her days roaming the property with princess @entity16 on board			1
speaking after the adoption last year , the princess royal explained : ' she 's perfect for me			0
she 's not wanting to be too ambitious and i do n't want to be very ambitious either			0
@entity16 , who is the patron of @entity59 which currently has 7,000 horses looking for homes , added : ' she fits in really well and as far as i 'm concerned i was really glad they did n't find someone else for her			1
she is just the size of horse that i could do with now			0
' living here and going across the farm i like to get off relatively easily and needed a horse that was reasonably reliable when it come to rural activities			0
' i hope @entity58 enjoys it here with me			0
we will be doing some hacking and she will be helping me herd the sheep and cattle			0
' rehoming from a charity may be the best way of finding a horse because you know so much more about the animal you are getting			0
' @entity16 , who shares the @entity24 with @entity33 and son @entity90 , has also been an enthusiastic supporter of her daughter 's eventing career			1
@entity33 , who also put in an appearance during prince @entity95 's @entity94 during a wheelchair rugby match , is one of the @entity36 's most successful eventing stars and is likely to feature in the @entity32 team at @entity99			0
what 's that ? princess @entity16 then got to grips with a scmitar as she toured an antique stall fairytale ending : @entity58 was given a new home with the princess royal at @entity108 last year neglect : prior to her new life as a royal steed , @entity58 had suffered years of neglect and had to be rescued home : princess @entity16 's 200 acre @entity115 home is the venue for numerous equestrian events			1

princess @entity16 stopped for coffee as she toured the @entity6
she was with her husband vice *admiral* *sir* @entity50 for the event
