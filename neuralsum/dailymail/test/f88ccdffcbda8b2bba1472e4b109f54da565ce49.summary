@entity1 , the club set up in protest at the @entity5 family 's takeover of @entity6 , are now two promotions away from the @entity8			1
on an emotional night in front of 3,588 noisy fans the @entity11 , soon to celebrate their 10th anniversary , sealed the fourth promotion of their short history with this nervy win over @entity17 saw them crowned @entity21 premier champions			1
hundreds of ecstatic supporters invaded the pitch at the final whistle as the breakaway outfit secured elevation to the sixth tier after the heartbreak of no less than four play - off defeats			1
and it was the @entity44 , home of neighbours @entity46 , that hosted the latest chapter in an already significant history			0
in a tense first - half winger @entity50 , a building estimator , headed against the bar as the home side struggled to break down a resolute @entity17 defence			1
and it appeared not to be their night when sub @entity57 had a volley cleared off the line			1
but on 69 minutes student and full back @entity60 rose unmarked to head home the impressive @entity50 's cross and spark joyous scenes			2
it was the perfect finish from the former @entity68 apprentice who was last week painting houses while on holiday from university			0
@entity1 came into existence in 2005 when a group of @entity6 supporters , despairing of the debt - burdening @entity76 takeover by the @entity79 - based family , decided enough was enough and created their own democratically - run club which kicked off at the bottom of the pyramid in @entity83			1
from an initial meeting of a dozen at a curry house in the @entity90 district of @entity91 they now boast more than 4,000 members , each of whom can claim to be an owners			0
many of those were in fine voice here			0
meanwhile , 30 miles down the road the @entity99 of ' 92 's @entity100 celebrated promotion from the @entity103 after title rivals @entity105 could only draw 1 - 1 at @entity106			1
that result means the club , partly owned by @entity6 legends @entity110 and @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , were crowned champions in the high - profile quintet 's first season at the helm			1
@entity1 manager @entity119 , who has been with the club since day one , believes ' anything is possible '			1
' we 've got a ground of our own , ' he said , before a fan planted a kiss on his cheek			0
' there 's no reason why the league is not possible			2
we have to provide that for these supporters because they deserve it			0
' @entity119 admits he did not know what to expect when he took over the fledgling club			2
' i did n't know what to think , ' he said			0
' i did n't have a clue			0
but it 's something i 'm immensely proud of			2
it 's something we have to hold onto			2
' fans storm the pitch as the breakaway outfit celebrates a significant moment in their short history when asked how he was going to celebrate @entity119 added : ' i 'm going to go to the @entity146 if it 's open when i get home			2
' general manager @entity148 , who has also been with fc from the beginning , echoed his manager 's comments			0
