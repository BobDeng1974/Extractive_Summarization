by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 insisted yesterday that he was ‘ perfectly happy ’ to recommend @entity4 for a knighthood and said ‘ a man is innocent until proven guilty ’			1
in an extraordinary defence of his own – and the @entity8 ’s – conduct concerning the serial sex abuser , the peer again insisted he knew nothing of @entity4 ’s vile activities			1
@entity2 claimed he was only aware of a @entity15 article in 1979 detailing how the 29 - stone monster spanked young boys ’ bare bottoms			1
claims : ex-liberal leader @entity2 ( right ) @entity2 said there ' is no question ' @entity4 ( left ) would be ' up for assault now ' , but argued that at the time corporal punishment ' went on ' he said he challenged @entity4 about the allegations – but took no further action			1
the former @entity8 leader reacted angrily to suggestions that it was negligent not to pursue ‘ gossip and tittle - tattle ’ that erupted about the @entity32 politician after the satirical magazine report			1
in a fractious @entity35 radio interview , he said : ‘ we ’re a political party , not a detective agency and idle gossip is not a basis for any inquiry at all			0
’ asked about claims by fellow @entity8 peer @entity42 that he had ‘ facetiously ’ said @entity4 ’s behaviour was no different from conduct at public schools , @entity2 said : ‘ you say it is a facetious remark			1
but it happens to be true that in those days corporal punishment was permitted			0
’ @entity52 mp @entity51 , whose book revealed the full extent of @entity4 ’s abuse of young boys , said : ‘ it is quite clear from @entity2 ’s response that there was no appetite to get to the heart of the very serious rumours that were circulating about @entity4			1
@entity2 said he confronted @entity4 over his ' unusual behavior ' at a hostel in @entity32 ‘ the general public will be very disappointed that , as the leader of a political party with just over a dozen mps at the time , he did not want to thoroughly investigate			1
‘ this was n’t about idle gossip , this was n’t about an mp who had had a few too many pints or an extra-marital affair , this was about one of his mps having sex with children			0
’ mr @entity51 , whose book @entity78 : the @entity80 of @entity4 was serialised in the @entity81 this month , added : ‘ now he can describe it as idle gossip and rumour but the wider public will be truly horrified and take it very seriously			2
’ @entity2 ’s interview comes amid growing calls for a public inquiry into the scandal over sir @entity4 ’s four decades of child abuse			1
on monday police announced a fresh probe into an alleged cover - up of @entity4 ’s activities in @entity32			2
yet senior @entity95 including @entity96 continue to claim they knew little of the true extent of @entity4 ’s abuse			2
mr @entity96 has said he sees no need for an internal inquiry			0
but mr @entity51 , whose book tells of appalling events at @entity104 residential school in @entity32 , says there is clear evidence of an establishment cover - up and an internal investigation is needed			0
@entity109 , who was 14 when he was molested by @entity4 in a @entity32 hostel in 1964 , said yesterday : ‘ @entity2 was told @entity4 had skeletons in his closet , heard about the rumours and yet he failed to conduct his own investigation			1
despite these accusations he suggests @entity4 could be innocent until proven guilty which i find insulting			2
’ deciding to speak publicly for the first time since the scandal erupted 17 days ago , @entity2 – who led the @entity118 between 1976 and 1988 – admitted he challenged @entity4 saying : ‘ what ’s all this in private eye ? ’ and he said : ‘ yes , the report is true			1
’ @entity15 went on to say the police had investigated but no further action had been taken			2
he told @entity126 at one presenter @entity127 : ‘ this was a different era , corporal punishment was permitted			0
it would be totally illegal now , there is no question he would be up for assault now but in those days it went on			0
demand : @entity2 's interview comes amid growing calls for a public inquiry into the scandal over sir @entity4 ¿ s four decades of child abuse probe : on monday police announced a fresh probe into an alleged cover - up of @entity4 's activities in @entity32 ‘ these were allegations that were ten to 15 years old			1
since then and , after the closure of one of these institutions , he had gone on to be elected mayor , he was awarded the mbe by the @entity52 for services to local government			0
i had no locus in the matter at all			0
’ he dismissed claims he should have done more to investigate , saying : ‘ why should i ? there was no allegation about his behaviour as an mp			2
there are now allegations which have come to light since his death and these are very serious but they were not known to us			0
’ he admitted he did not ask the police or the @entity8 in @entity32 about the allegations			2
‘ they were ancient allegations about his time as a local councillor , nothing to do with his life as an mp and anything that has emerged since was not known to me or to anybody else			0
’ allegations : @entity2 claimed he was only aware of a @entity15 article in 1979 detailing how the 29 - stone monster spanked young boys ' bare bottoms @entity2 defended recommending @entity4 for a knighthood , despite the rumours			1
he said : ‘ he had been the distinguished mp for the area for 15 years , he had announced he was n’t standing again , he was in poor health , his life expectancy was unknown – many mps got knighthoods at 14 and 15 years and i was perfectly happy with that			0
’ asked if @entity4 should have been prosecuted , @entity2 said : ‘ it sounds as though he should have been , yes , and certainly if these things happened today he would undoubtedly be prosecuted			1
‘ a man is innocent until proved guilty			0
i hope these current inquiries will lead to some conclusion			0
i think the victims deserve to have their questions answered			0
