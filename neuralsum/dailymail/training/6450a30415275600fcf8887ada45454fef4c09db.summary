it did n't take long			0
with the outbreak of a global health crisis on the scale of the current @entity6 epidemic , there was bound to be a flurry of conspiracy theories			1
and the internet 's finest have been hard at work			2
from the prospect of the @entity6 - based zombie horror film @entity12 becoming reality to the @entity17 government deliberately releasing the virus , there 's plenty out there for the tin foil hat brigade to sink their teeth into			1
a caption reads : ' for the first time in human history , confirmed footage is captured of a man who scientists watched die from @entity6 then only several hours later , regain life and rise from the dead '			1
it then cites @entity47 passage @entity45 26:19 - 20 : ' your dead shall live , their bodies shall rise			2
' the picture was later revealed to be nothing more than a screenshot of an actor in the movie @entity28 starring @entity29			1
the zombie hoax appears to have been inspired by several real - life reports of @entity6 victims coming back from the dead			1
one story which appeared on the @entity63 website recently told of two @entity6 patients who died of the virus in separate communities coming back to life two days later			2
one conspiracy theory , which claims the current @entity6 strain is hybrid of @entity6 and @entity71 , has drawn several comparisons with the 2002 @entity74 film @entity12 conspiracy ? many believe that the ebola virus was created in a laboratory by unscrupulous pharmaceutical companies hoping to profit from the sale of vaccines the website reported : ' the late @entity83 of @entity84 and the second victim only identified as @entity86 , said to be in her late 60s , were about to be taken for burial when they resurrected			1
' @entity86 had reportedly been in door for two nights without food and medication before her alleged death			0
' another story from @entity96 last week tells of a man thought to have died from @entity6 in the middle of a street who started waving his arms when funeral workers arrived to pick up his body			1
that has led some to suggest that the virus is man - made and has been designed either as a weapon or simply so pharmaceutical companies can profit from selling vaccines and cures			1
some users insist the current @entity6 strain is hybrid of @entity6 and @entity71 , drawing comparisons with the film @entity12 and raising the unlikely prospect that the film 's plot may become reality			2
@entity121 leader @entity120 claims @entity6 is a ' race - targeting bioweapon created by white people ' in the 2002 film directed by @entity74 , a highly contagious virus known as the rage virus is released after animal liberation activists break into a laboratory where tests are being conducted on chimpanzees			1
scientists in the movie were attempting to create an anger management drug and had decided to use the ebola virus as a delivery system			0
but @entity6 mutates the drug , causing it to have the oppposite effect and send people into fits of constant , uncontrollable rage with physical symptoms resembling rabies - leading them to attack other humans and pass on the virus at a rapidly increasing rate until only a small minority have escaped infection			1
exponents of this theory point to research conducted in 2012 by the @entity152 ( @entity153 ) which developed an @entity6 vaccine based on the established rabies virus vaccine			2
the scientists first tested the vaccine on mice before moving on to monkeys and claim the research was extremely successful			0
speculation has been further fuelled by a 2012 report of a rabies - like virus that has all the symptoms of and lethality of @entity6 and which killed two teenagers in @entity167 in 2009			1
believers of this theory warn people not to take the vaccine which will soon be rolled out			0
in the @entity17 , @entity173 leader @entity120 claims the ebola virus is a ' race - targeting bioweapon created by white people '			1
he says the @entity17 government ' has a desire for world depopulation ' and is intent on going about it by using bioweapons ' such as @entity6 and @entity183 , which are race targeting weapons			1
' he wrote : ' there is a weapon that can be put in a room where there are @entity190 people , and it will kill only the @entity191 and spare the @entity192 , because it is a genotype weapon that is designed for your genes , for your race , for your kind			0
' this means that these wise scientists of death are making pathogens , which is something that can cause a disease			0
' they are creating this as a means of depopulating our planet of undesirables , a process called culling the population			0
… so , if you are poor and ignorant ; if you are @entity191 or @entity212 , you are being selected for destruction			0
' history : the ebola virus as discovered in 1976 following major outbreaks that year in the @entity217 and @entity167 health workers say the fight against the outbreak is being hindered by claims of miracle cures such as rubbing limes and onions over your body and by unscrupulous merchants selling bogus treatments			1
the @entity229 has issued several warnings over bogus cures and precautionary measures			1
a scene from @entity235 horror film @entity12 @entity237 users have slammed @entity238 , accusing the broadcaster of uploading the @entity6 - related zombie film @entity12 to its on - demand movie service as concerns over the outbreak grow			1
@entity237 user @entity244 wrote today : ' @entity229 's going @entity6 mad and @entity238 decides to show @entity28 and 28 days later and 28 weeks later in the last 2 days			1
. bad timing or what ... ' and user ' luna ' ‏ wrote : ' sky movies have decided to upload 28 days later while the ebola virus is breaking out , thanks for terrifying me '			0
the film features in the ' recently added ' section of the @entity238 ' on demand ' service			0
the channel did not respond to requests for a comment			0
in @entity96 healers have suggested rubbing the body with limes and onions can combat the virus while across the region merchants are profiting from the panic by selling fake @entity6 vaccinations and cures			1
one rumour that has been widely circulated is that drinking saltwater can prevent or cure the disease , an entirely false claim that is believed to be responsible for the deaths of four people			0
a spokesman for @entity229 said : ' another source of public misunderstanding , especially in affected areas , comes from rumours on social media claiming that certain products or practices can prevent or cure ebola virus disease			2
' decades of scientific research have failed to find a curative or preventive agent of proven safety and effectiveness in humans , though a number of promising products are currently under development			0
' all rumours of any other effective products or practices are false			0
their use can be dangerous			0
in @entity298 , for example , at least two people have died after drinking salt water , rumoured to be protective			0
' @entity6 was discovered in 1976 following major outbreaks that year in the @entity217 and @entity167			2
in the 1990s , the disease saw a resurgence with an outbreak in @entity304 in 1994 , followed by another in @entity167 in 1995			0
the current outbreak , the worst in recorded history , began last december and has killed more than 3,800 people mainly in @entity309 and is threatening to spread across @entity310 and the @entity311			0
between 2000 - 2004 , close to 500 people died from @entity6 in @entity313 , @entity304 , the @entity314 and @entity217			1
the vast majority of those deaths have been in @entity317 , @entity96 and @entity318			0
in a similar way to how the hiv / aids outbreak was often said to be man made , some believe @entity6 has been deliberately created to decrease the world 's and in particular @entity309 's rapidly expanding population			1
others suggest it has been deliberately engineered to target black people			0
this is a variation of the man - made theory which suggests the current media attention surrounding the outbreak in @entity309 is nothing but government programming so that people are ready to line up to take the rabies - based vaccine they are preparing to roll out			2
some believe @entity6 was secretly created by the @entity337 as part of a foreign policy initiative to counter the threat of communism and black nationalism in @entity343 some deeply religious @entity344 believe @entity6 to be the wrath of god , a punishment for immoral acts			2
the @entity350 of @entity351 ( @entity352 ) has issued a statement reading : ‘ @entity96 have to pray and seek @entity349 ’s forgiveness over the corruption and immoral acts ( such as homosexuality ) that continue to penetrate our society			0
@entity360 , we must repent and seek @entity349 ’s forgiveness ’ in parts of @entity298 a rumour has been spreading that @entity6 can be cured or prevented by drinking hot salt water			2
four healthy people are believed to died from dehydration as a result of trying to protect themselves in this way we reported yesterday how some internet conspiracy theorists , claim the world famous tv series predicted the @entity6 crisis back in a 1997 episode in which @entity375 tries to coax a sick @entity376 out of bed she suggests he reads a book before producing one entitled ' @entity379 and the @entity380 ' .			1

outbreak being compared to @entity383
fake picture of ' first @entity6 zombie ' went viral over the internet last week
revealed to be a screen grab from another @entity235 movie @entity28
theories being fuelled by stories of @entity6 victims ' rising from the dead '
@entity121 leader @entity120 called it a ' race - targeting bioweapon '
