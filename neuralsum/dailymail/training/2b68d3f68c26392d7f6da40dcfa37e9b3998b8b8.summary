' persistently heavy rain and flooding earlier in the year created the perfect storm for @entity47 ’s pothole epidemic , ' said @entity83 , managing director of @entity59 said			2
' councils therefore face difficult choices in the roads they prioritise for repair this winter			0
motorists should protect themselves by keeping an eye out for potholes and keeping speeds down - particularly in wet weather when potholes may be filled by rain			0

' while recent harsh winters have exacerbated and highlighted the poor state of our roads , the seeds of our current problems were sown decades ago			0
' back in the mid 1980s local road surfaces were being repaired and replaced once every 12 years or so			0
today the rate is once every 25 years			0
' he went on : ' spending on roads has fallen by almost a quarter in real terms over the past five years			0
' the future looks equally bleak			0
road spending is not ring fenced and councils say more and more of their limited funds are being diverted to statutory obligations like providing environmental services and social care			0
' the figures have sparked a call by the @entity195 for an extra £ 1 billion a year to be spent on roads			0
the @entity195 ’s transport spokesman , @entity197 , said the floods which ravaged @entity47 between october 2013 and february this year left many stretches of road “ crumbling and warned that another cold wet winter could mark the “ tipping point ” for the local road network			0
' “ despite spiralling multi-million pound compensation costs and funding cuts , councils still fixed two million potholes last year , ” ' he said			2
“ ' but we need long - term funding to tackle the ever - growing £ 12 billion roads repair backlog facing the nation			0
' “ last year ’s floods caused widespread destruction on our roads leaving motorists to drive on crumbling highways that are increasingly unfit for the 21st century			0
“ ' our fear is that another harsh winter could be the tipping point for our roads			0
“ ' tackling this crisis must be a national priority			0
that is why we are calling for the government to inject a further £ 1 billion a year into roads maintenance by investing the equivalent of just two pence per litre of existing fuel duty			0
” ' the @entity228 said £ 168 million was made available in april this year for three million emergency pothole repairs in addition to £ 10 billion that councils will receive for local road maintenance between 2010 and 2012			1
a spokesman said : ' potholes are a menace for all road users			0
this government has taken action to improve road conditions by spending £ 1 billion more on local roads maintenance over this parliament than in 2005 - 10			2
' between 2010 and 2021 we have committed a total of £ 10 billion to making roads safer and easier to use , improvements that will make a real difference to people right across the country			0
