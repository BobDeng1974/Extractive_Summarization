a fireman paralysed from the waist down after his spinal cord was completely severed has regained the ability to walk thanks to @entity6 scientists			1
@entity7 , 40 , is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from such chronic injuries , in an achievement hailed as more impressive than putting a @entity12			1
mr @entity7 ’s spinal cord was sliced in half during a stabbing four years ago , leaving him paralysed below the waist			1
he is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from such chronic injuries amazingly , the @entity22 patient has now been able to resume an independent life – walking with a frame – thanks to a revolutionary technique pioneered at @entity27 , @entity22 , and @entity28			1
mr @entity7 suffered damage similar to that of actor @entity31 , whose spine was severed from his skull after he fell off a horse in 1995			1
while some victims of partial spinal injury have recovered , a complete break was generally assumed to be irreparable			2
however , scientists in @entity22 used cells from mr @entity7 ’s brain cavity to re-grow nerve cells which were then inserted into his spine , fixing the broken link			1
this graphic shows the steps making up the procedure , which allowed mr @entity7 to walk again			1
scientists transplanted olffactory ensheathing cells into the damaged part of the spinal chord , to grown new nerve cells it is the first time the procedure has been shown to work on a human			1
professor @entity54 of @entity28 said : ‘ we believe that this procedure is the breakthrough which , as it is further developed , will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury			1
’ he described mr @entity7 ’s recovery as ‘ more impressive than man walking on the @entity62 ’			1
the research , funded by the @entity64 and @entity6 @entity65 , will be featured in a @entity67 programme on @entity68 tonight			0
the 40 - year - old fireman from @entity22 was paralysed from the waist down after being stabbed four years ago scientists from @entity27 in @entity22 and the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) pioneered the breakthrough procedure			1
it was designed to enable @entity7 to walk again , after his spinal cord was sliced in half during a stabbing four years ago , leaving him paralysed below the waist			1
the procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or @entity80 – from the olfactory bulb in the brain cavity to the spinal cord			1
@entity84 assist the repair of damaged nerves in the nose that transmit smell messages to the brain			1
the cells were transplanted into the spinal cord , using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury			1
a small piece of nerve tissue , which was taken from the ankle , was grafted onto the ' gap ' in the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend , as guided by the @entity84			2
this enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together – something that was previously thought to be impossible			0
three months after the operation , mr @entity7 began to gain muscle in his left leg and regained sensations in it , such as hot and cold , and pins and needes			2
a year later , he is able to walk again , with the aid of parallel bars			0
the procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or @entity80 – from the olfactory bulb in the brain cavity to the spinal cord where they allowed nerve cells to regrow and bridge the ' gap ' in the severed spinal cord professor @entity54 ( pictured ) at @entity28 's @entity123 performed the pioneering procedure			1
he said : ‘ we believe that this procedure is the breakthrough which , as it is further developed , will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury ’ professor @entity54 , whose work is also published in the journal @entity134 today , said : ‘ [ mr @entity7 ] can get around with a walker and he ’s been able to resume much of his original life , including driving a car			1
' he ’s not dancing , but he ’s absolutely delighted			0
’ he continued : ‘ the number of patients who are completely paralysed is enormous			2
' there are millions of them in the world			2
if we can convince the global neurosurgeon community that this works then it will develop very rapidly indeed			0
’ dr @entity147 , of the @entity27 , said : ‘ we estimated that without this treatment , our patient ’s recovery chances were less than one per cent			1
' however , we observed a gradual recovery of both sensory and motor function that began four months after the surgery			0

two weeks later , the cells were transplanted into the spinal cord , using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury			2
a small piece of nerve tissue , which was taken from the ankle , was grafted onto the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend , as guided by the @entity84			2
this enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together across the ' gap ' – something that was previously thought to be impossible			0
three months after the operation , mr @entity7 began to gain muscle in his left leg and regain sensation in parts of his lower body			2
he felt hot and cold as well as pins and needles in the limb			0
a year after surgery - and large amounts of physiotherapy at the rehabilitation centre in @entity193 - he could walk with the aid of parallel bars and using a walker with short callipers supporting his ankles			0
professor @entity54 said : ‘ the observed wisdom is that the central nervous system can not regenerate damaged connections			0
i ’ve never believed that			0
’ he stressed that what had been achieved was a leap forward beyond ‘ plasticity ’ – the re-wiring of the remaining connections			0
he compared that method to motorists finding other routes around a closed section of motorway , adding : ‘ what we ’re doing is repairing the motorway			0
’ speaking on @entity217 's @entity216 , professor @entity54 said : ' this [ procedure ] opens the door , which i had always been knocking at - to see that our nervous system has the ability to repair itself			0
‘ this is the beginning of a repair for spinal injuries and other types of injuries - including stroke			1
‘ the idea that the nervous system can repair itself in rats and in one man - there ’s no reason to restrict this to just the spinal cord			2
it opens the door to a future which is terrifyingly large			0
‘ we ’ve climbed two mountains and we are now at the foot of the ( next ) mountain			0
we have knowledge which could be of great value , we ca n’t stop now			0
the @entity64 was founded by @entity247 @entity246 after his son @entity248 was paralysed in a swimming accident at the age of 18			0
he said : ‘ i promised @entity251 that i would not give up until a cure had been found			0
professor @entity54 and dr @entity147 ’s breakthrough marks the first step			0

@entity7 is the first person in the world to recover from chronic injuries
fireman was paralysed from the waist down after severing spinal chord
he received treatment pioneered by @entity27 in @entity22 and @entity28
cells taken from his brain cavity were injected into the spine and regrew to repair broken link , enabling him to begin walking again
