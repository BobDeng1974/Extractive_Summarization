@entity0 reached out to multiple women on a sex website in the days before launching a massacre which killed 12 people and injured 58 during a screening of @entity6 , it has emerged			1
however , at least three of the women he contacted through @entity10 rejected his advances - even though he was apparently just hoping to ' chat ' with ' nothing sexual ' on the cards			1
the news follows rumours that @entity0 may have broken up with a girlfriend shortly before the shooting in @entity19 , @entity20 , and that he was due to be evicted from his apartment after dropping out of grad school			1
gunman : @entity0 apparently contacted at least three women online days before the @entity19 shooting picture : @entity0 posted this photograph of himself with a poster of model @entity27 on his site profile the 24 - year - old gunman 's profile on @entity10 first came to light the day after he attacked a midnight screening of the @entity34 blockbuster			1
it shows pictures of @entity0 with dyed red hair posing with a poster of @entity39 model @entity27 , and features the chilling tagline , ' will you visit me in prison ? ' the phd dropout wrote on the site that he was looking for ' a fling or casual sex ' - and described himself as ' a nice guy '			1
but one of the women who was in contact with @entity0 told @entity52 she thought he was ' just looking to maybe chat ... nothing sexual '			1
he asked to meet up with her but she turned down the request , as did two other women who talked to @entity52 about their communication with him			2
profile : @entity0 said he was looking for ' a fling or casual sex ' in his posting on @entity10 @entity0 had dropped out of the @entity61 weeks before the attack and was nearing the end of his grace period for staying at the institution 's accommodation			1
@entity19 police chief @entity67 also hinted that @entity0 had recently gone through a break up and that authorities were investigating the claim			1
a former classmate from the @entity61 suggested another cause for the killings , describing @entity0 as someone who had lost touch with reality after becoming ' obsessed ' with video games			1
the classmate told the @entity78 : ' @entity0 was obsessed with computer games and was always playing role - playing games			1
inside the life of a killer : after spending hours dismantling the many booby traps set up around @entity0 ' @entity19 apartment , police investigated the area and took pictures of the evidence ' i ca n’t remember which one but it was something like @entity93 , one of those where you compete against people on the internet			1
' he did not have much of a life apart from that and doing his work			2
@entity0 seemed like he wanted to be in the game and be one of the characters			2
' it seemed that being online was more important to him than real life			0
he must have lost his sense of reality , how else can you shoot dozens of people you do n’t know ? ' it is also believed that @entity0 was due to be evicted from his flat			1
the 24 - year - old , who is now in police custody , pulled out of the university weeks before the deadly attack			1
@entity117 told @entity52 anyone living in the block had to be enrolled at the university otherwise you had 30 days to evacuate			2
it is not known exactly when @entity0 stopped going to classes but it is thought he was nearing the end of the 30 - day grace period			1
interests : glimpses into @entity0 ' apartment show that he had a poster of the video game @entity128 earlier @entity19 police chief @entity67 addressed the hunt for a motive for @entity0 's murderous actions , telling @entity134 ' @entity135 : ' i ’ve heard one morsel of information about a relationship that may or may not be true			1
' that ’s why we have all our investigators working on this			0
that ’s why we brought in the @entity146 behavioral analysts			0
they ’re going to figure all that stuff out			0
' there will be no easy or quick answers			0
and maybe there will never be any answers			0
this requires a lot of work			0
and we ’re just not in a position to give any indications of that now			0
' and again , whatever we do develop , the proper place to make sure we get proper justice for the victims is to reveal that stuff in the course of the criminal prosecution			0
' this clue came out on the same day as it was revealed that in addition to his profile on @entity10 , @entity0 also had a profile active on the dating website , @entity171			1
inspecting carefully : police and fire officials carried out the search of @entity0 ' apartment during the same interview , mr @entity67 said that they had spoken with someone who was an acquaintance of the 24 - year - old shooting suspect , leading many to initially fear that the investigation had not come to an end			1
' this was a person who had contact with the suspect , a casual acquaintance , ' mr @entity67 told @entity185			0
' we found him yesterday , we interviewed him			0
' during the talk with @entity135 's @entity188 , mr @entity67 was quick to downplay the questioning			0
' the relationship was really inconsequential and we 're happy that we spoke to him			0
that 's all that was , ' he said			0
a witness at the scene initially said that he thought he saw a second man helping @entity0 during the attack			1
the male witness who saw @entity0 launch his deadly attack says he thought he also saw someone open the doors of the movie theatre to let the shooter in			1
anti-social : @entity0 was thought to be a recluse who covered his windows with black garbage bags so that no one could see in insight : pictures have not been released of the interior of his apartment , so the only glimpses come from the outside looking in the witness , who has not been named , told @entity216 it appeared that a cinemagoer who left the screening after receiving a telephone call deliberately left the emergency exit open			2
@entity0 used the emergency exit to access the screening of the @entity34 blockbuster in @entity19 , @entity20			2
the witness said : ' as i was sitting down to get my seat , i noticed that a person came up to the front row , the front right , sat down , and as credits were going , it seemed like he got a phone call			0
' so he went out toward the emergency exit doorway , which i thought was unusual to take a phone call			0
and it seemed like he probably pried it open , or probably did not let it latch all the way			0
' as soon as the movie started , somebody came in , all black , gas mask , armour , and threw a gas can into the audience , and it went off , and then there were gunshots that took place			0
' mr @entity67 was clear to mention that while they were still trying to determine the circumstances leading up to the fatal attack - and what , if any , motive the young man had - he said that police are confident in saying that he acted alone			2
' all the evidence we have , every single indicator , is that this was all mr @entity0 ' activity			2
he was n't particularly aided by anyone else , ' mr @entity67 said during the interview			0
massacre : 12 people were left dead and 58 injured in the @entity20 shooting the first time that police began to think that there may have been an accomplice was when a local officer received a threatening electronic message saturday evening , demanding that @entity0 be released from custody or else the sender would become violent			1
the sender and the format of the message have not been released publicly , but police investigated the threat and appear confident that there was no accomplice			0
they spent hours on friday and saturday in @entity0 ' apartment , dismantling the many booby traps and explosives that the madman had set up to kill whomever entered his apartment			2
unconfirmed reports state that @entity0 had a @entity285 poster adorning one of the walls			2
police chief @entity288 would not comment on the poster , but photographers did capture a portion of a different poster while investigators were examining the shooter 's apartment			1
a poster for a video game called @entity128 is visible - and fitting considering both @entity0 ' interest in video games and his maniacal course of destruction that has torn @entity19 apart			1
witness : this man claims to have seen someone leave the emergency exit of the cinema open for @entity0 near the beginning of the film @entity310 told the @entity311 that he has known @entity312 for more than a decade and they also both attended undergraduate school at the @entity315 , @entity315 , where they saw each other once a week to watch the television series @entity317			2
they last met in december for dinner and a movie			0
mr @entity310 says at the time , @entity0 seemed fine			0
he also says academics came easily to @entity0 both at high school and at the @entity315			0
mr @entity310 says he remembers that in one college class they had together , @entity0 did n't take notes but would just sit through class and always got an @entity328 police have surmised that the grad school dropout had seemingly spent months planning the murderous assault , as he had amassed a stockpile of arms and explosives over long period of time .			2
