@entity12 quarterback @entity11 also threw a first pitch , at @entity14 in @entity15 - but did n't do himself proud , chucking the ball straight at the ground			1
the @entity19 families were joined by mayor @entity20 at a time when his relationship with the police department is again coming under scrutiny			2
they were murdered on patrol in @entity71 on december 20 by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide			2
since that crisis , which threatened to overwhelm the mayor 's agenda , @entity20 has taken pains to repair relations with the nation 's largest police force , brokering a new union contract , investing in new technology and training , and doubling down on his public praise of the department			0
on monday , he joined the tens of thousands of fans in cheering as the officers ' images were displayed on the park 's giant video screens and again when @entity31 ' two sons and @entity30 's widow threw out the pitches to @entity5 players @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
@entity63 , however , was largely booed when he was introduced to the crowd			1
a year ago , @entity20 was also booed as he threw out the first pitch ( a strike )			2
both years , he sported a @entity5 cap and jersey , which was emblazoned with his last name and the number 6 , a tribute to @entity106 , a longtime shortstop on @entity20 's favorite team , the @entity107			2
@entity106 , like @entity20 , was also of @entity109 descent and lived in @entity71			0
the tribute to the @entity19 comes as @entity20 is weighing a @entity112 proposal to hire 1,000 more police officers			0
the idea has been endorsed by union leaders who said it would reduce pressure on existing officers to keep crime low			0
but @entity20 rejected an identical council proposal a year ago , pointing to the city 's record low crime and suggesting that the money would be better spent elsewhere			0

@entity63 has not committed to hiring more officers but has been more receptive to the proposal in his public remarks than he was a year ago			0
the council 's budget office projected that hiring two new classes of officers , to total 1,000 , would cost nearly $ 69m in the upcoming fiscal year			0
but the council believes that the cost will be offset by the corresponding reduction in overtime			0
