calling the post , a ' different kind of video ' than normal , the @entity13 native launches into a harrowing attack on a @entity18 , the father she says sexually abused her from the age of four to 13			1
' my zombie eyes are in full affect , ' she half - quips mustering the effort to laugh at herself through tears before explaining the motive behind her post			1
' i just got an email from you tube saying the man that raped me for most of my life subscribed to me			2
the man that took my virginity , robbed me of innocence , has subscribed to me on @entity55 and is watching my videos			1
' ' i never got to testify in court and tell him what it feels like being tied up and chained and tortured for hours when you 're four years old by your father , ' she continues			1
trauma : the usually perfectly made - up former pageant queen and actress appears bare faced and teary as she explains that the man who repeatedly raped her recently subscribed to her popular @entity55 channel @entity71 : ms @entity7 tells him that ' now is the time ' for her to speak out about the unspeakable things he did to her as a child which she claims she never got to tell to a court according to the statement , her father not only forced himself on her but tried to kill her mother , @entity82 , ' many times '			1

' even at my age i still have nightmares that he 's coming back to kill me			0
' though ms @entity7 tells her viewers that she got away from him at 13 , how she managed to do this is unclear as she still lives in the city in which she grew up			1
a lifelong resident of @entity23 , ms @entity7 's own website exclaims proudly : ' i was born and raised in the " @entity23 " also known as " @entity104 , " @entity23 and am proud to call it home ! ' remaining in @entity23 for college , the bit - part actress attended @entity108 in the city where she graduated with a degree in @entity111 and though now she spends a significant amount of time sharing her secrets on @entity55 , according to her latest post she also teaches children			1
happier : a self - ascribed ' beauty guru ' , ms lybrand 's website hosts her advice videos and tells fans of her latest bit - parts in movies and commercials ' you wan na see what kind of person i turned out to be ? ' she challenges her father before the video cuts to a new shot and she lists her achievements as cheer - leading captain at high school and college graduate			1
her choice to become an actor is one , she explains , chillingly , that she credits to him			2
' i think i became an actor because i had to escape my reality			0
the reality of the tortures of what you did			0
i got really good at it			0
i got really good at pretending i was somewhere else			0
@entity18 , when you were raping me my mind was somewhere else			1
' i was in @entity144 , or i was on a beach			0
or on a swing listening to @entity148 musicals			0
but i was anywhere except you on top of me			0
and i have turned that into my career			0
' switching the subject , ms @entity7 then goes on to ask how he managed to get someone to marry him and calls his new wife by her name			1
how she knows this information is unclear but she refers to a lady named @entity162 and then claims her real name is @entity164			0

and finally a third , pink gun that proves is loaded by opening the barrel			0
' even though i will be forever damaged because of you , you have n't gotten the best of me ... i met a wonderful man who understands , who is there when i have to cry and when i have to be upset on father 's day when i did n't have a father			2
' the man she talks about is @entity201 who appears in a couple of wedding photographs on her @entity205 page and yet who she refers to later in the video as her fiance			1
