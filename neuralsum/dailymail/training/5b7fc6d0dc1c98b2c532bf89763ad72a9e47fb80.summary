in ' @entity5 ' , which has had nearly a million hits since it was uploaded , comedians @entity16 and @entity17 sing about not being attractive or rich enough to attract any @entity19 women , despite being nice guys			1
but in ' @entity21 of @entity19 ' female comedians and rapper 2 - k sing about men who think of themselves as nice guys but are actually raging misogynists who are only interested in hot , shallow women and think they are entitled to sex			1

' wait , i forgot , it 's more important that i 'm hot , and relying on my vagina is for sure my best shot ! ' ignorance is bliss , i 'm better off lobotomised with big fake t * * * ! ' the video also features sections with self - appointed nice guys displaying what shallow hypocrites they really are			2
the chorus of the song runs : ' we deserve to get laid			0
we are the nice guys of @entity19			2

' other portions show men blaming women for being shallow instead of blaming their own failings as human beings for their inability to get a woman			1
one desultory - looking man sings : ' whores do n't like me because i 'm short ' , followed by a pipe - smoking man reading a pretentious book who emotes : ' sluts do n't want the intellectual sort			0
' want a piece of this ? : a man tries to seduce the viewer with the promise of chick flicks - but only if they 're hot one of the ' @entity21 ' attempts to seduce a pair of beautiful women with his impressive six dollars those offended by ' @entity5 ' have praised the video in the @entity103 comments			0
