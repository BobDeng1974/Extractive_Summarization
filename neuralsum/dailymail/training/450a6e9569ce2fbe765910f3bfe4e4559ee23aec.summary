by @entity0 published : 15:16 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 15:51 est , 26 june 2013 one of the @entity3 teenagers accused of fatally stabbing 16 - year - old classmate @entity1 was like a second daughter to the victim 's parents			1
the girl had been in and out of @entity9 and @entity11 's house since age eight , but this girl they thought of as family also apparently lied to them for nearly a year about their daughter 's death			1
though her name is common knowledge in this small @entity3 town , it has n't been publicly released by authorities because of the confidentiality of juvenile court			2
one of the @entity3 teenagers accused of fatally stabbing 16 - year - old @entity1 ( seen in held photograph ) was like a second daughter to @entity9 and @entity11 ( pictured ) only if and when she is charged as an adult in the slaying of @entity1 will the suspect 's identity be publicly revealed			1
but @entity34 's parents know who she is			1
or at least they thought they did			2
' she walked in the door when she came here			2
she did n't even knock			2
she was like our daughter , ' @entity38 said			2
' and not to know someone is more scary than knowing them , because now you know what they 're capable of			2
' authorities say the unidentified juvenile and a second girl , 16 - year - old @entity1 , plotted to lure @entity34 out of her family 's apartment and kill her last july 6			1
most likely , @entity34 's mother says , the @entity52 honors student just thought she was going for a joyride			2
' one after another , just lie , lie , lie , ' @entity11 said this week in her first extensive interview since the slaying			1
' did the same thing to the police			1
that 's how the police got onto them , because they would forget what they told them at one point and tell them another , totally different story			1
' gone : @entity1 disappeared in july 2012 and was initially thought to be a runaway but her parents soon suspected she had been abducted investigators say @entity74 and the other girl drove @entity34 to a remote spot on a gravel road where the lush woods become @entity79 , @entity80 , just across a bridge and over the railroad tracks from the unincorporated @entity3 community of @entity84			1
the girls chatted for a while , according to testimony at @entity74 's plea hearing on a second - degree murder charge			1
then , at an agreed - upon moment , they stabbed her			1
' what was going through my baby 's head ? ' @entity38 wonders			0
' i ca n't imagine what she was thinking the night this happened			0
why ? you know ? same thing everybody else is asking			0
why ? why would you kill me ? ' this is a girl that 's 16 years old , that loves her friends to death			1
would do anything in the world for them , ' he said			0
' and they turn on her and count down — 3 , 2 , 1 — and stab her ? i mean , what kind of sickness is that ? ' @entity74 's identity was revealed may 1 when prosecutors transferred her case to adult court and accepted her guilty plea			1
authorities have said nothing about @entity74 or her unidentified co-defendant since			0
friends : @entity1 ( on the right in both pictures ) has confessed to stabbing @entity1 ( left ) to death last summer tragic : police chased numerous leads in trying to find @entity11 with no luck			1
until @entity74 came forward the @entity131 , however , say they expect her name to be made public soon , possibly after @entity74 's as - yet unscheduled sentencing hearing			1
@entity74 told police the girls tried to bury the body , but hid it under some tree limbs when they could n't			1
and there it lay for seven months			0
when the @entity142 could n't find their daughter the morning of july 7 , they did n't worry			1
they called the unidentified suspect			0
no , she told them			0
have n't seen her in a few days			0
in hindsight , it was odd			0
they 'd been friends half their lives but became even tighter when the suspect moved from her home in the country to a closer one in town , @entity11 said			1
' they were inseparable at that point			0
either she was at our house or @entity34 was at her house , ' @entity11 said			1
charged : @entity1 , of @entity158 , pleaded guilty to the second - degree murder of @entity1 and she awaits sentencing in a juvenile detention center they started hanging around with @entity74 , and @entity34 's other friends quietly dropped out of the picture			1
then the trouble began , her mother said , ' one mess after another			0
' their antics were fairly typical teenage behavior , she said — skipping class , joyriding with boys , breaking @entity176 's 11 p.m. curfew — until they got hauled home by police at 2 a.m. after breaking the speed limit			2
' luckily , there was no alcohol , no drugs , nothing like that , ' @entity11 said			1
' they were just riding around			0
but still , you 're not supposed to do that			0
' later , the @entity188 discovered @entity34 had been slipping out her first - floor bedroom window and dropping a few feet to the ground			2
' we thought they had learned their lesson , ' @entity11 said			1
' she was like , ' i understand , @entity195			0
' she was in tears — not for herself but for the other girls being in trouble			2
so we thought they had learned their lesson			0
which we found out after			2
' it took until 4 p.m. on the day after the killing for panic to set in			0
that 's when the @entity206 's where @entity34 worked called to say she had n't shown up for a shift			0
the next day , the longtime friend came to the apartment			0
she went door to door with @entity11 , asking if people had seen @entity34			1
@entity11 had no reason to think she was anything but concerned			1
mystery : people in the small @entity3 town had wondered for months about @entity1			0
she vanished after slipping out the bedroom of her @entity176 home in july 2012 for months , police chased down tips that led nowhere			1
even they did n't initially suspect the girls			2
they might know more than they were saying , police told the @entity188			2
maybe they 're protecting someone			0
then the stories started to conflict			0
@entity11 defended the girls ' countless times ' as police tried to tell her what they suspected			1
' i kept saying , ' no. you guys , they are having as hard a time with this as we are , '' she said			0
the transcript from @entity74 's hearing shows the break came jan. 3 , when she finally told investigators the truth — and where to find the body			0
what they still do n't know is why			0
@entity74 told police the girls just did n't want to be friends with @entity34 anymore			1
@entity9 and @entity11 just shake their heads			1
they know there 's more to it than that			0
@entity11 wants to look @entity74 in the eye and ask			1
with the other girl , she says , there 's no point			0
but @entity74 is now awaiting sentencing at a detention center in @entity262			0
prosecutors have indicated they 'll recommend a 20 - year prison sentence , though the victim 's parents hope the judge will disregard he plea agreement and impose the 40 years allowed by law			1
either way , they may never know why their daughter died			0
what they do know is they want to share their story			0
they are working with two local writers on a book to ' get parents to open their eyes , just like we should have done , ' @entity11 said			1
the couple tried to trust their daughter			0
go out with your friends , they said			2
let us know where you are			0
be home at a reasonable hour			0
' i tried to give her her freedom , so we were n't on top of her all the time , ' @entity11 said			1
' now in hindsight , those parents who do that ? more power to them			2
' tribute : a @entity304 image created by @entity1 's friends as they all prayed she would show up			2
