an exam board apologised yesterday for a ' confusing ' chemistry @entity2 question that students complain was impossible to answer			1
the @entity5 admitted that guidance given in an @entity2 paper sat by just under 16,000 teenagers was ' unhelpful '			0
it has insisted that examiners will take into account ' the potential for confusion ' when marking the question and ensure that students are not penalised			1
frustration : students argue that a question was ' impossible to answer using the data provided ' in a chemistry exam on tuesday ( file pic ) students have set up a @entity23 page , @entity22 , which is ' liked ' by over 2,000 people , in protest over the @entity5 chemistry exam which was sat on tuesday			1
they argue that one question was ' impossible to answer using the data provided ' while some claim there was n't enough time to complete the difficult paper			1
the contested question - worth five marks out of a potential 100 for the whole paper - asked students to make a calculation using a ratio they should have come up with in part one			1
to help students who could not calculate the original ratio , the paper gave them another ratio to use to answer part two			2
however , it also told them in bold print that this was ' not the correct ratio '			0
one student said : ' a question regarding the percentage of a certain compound required us to use a ratio from the previous question			2
however if one did not get that ratio , there was a ' wrong ' ratio given for use to at least get method marks			2
' however , the result using this ratio was more than 100 per cent which is chemically , mathematically and theoretically impossible			2
' another said : ' i know that a lot of students spent a long time trying to work out a rational answer and so ran out of time to answer other questions			0
i feel sorry for a lot of people who are now worried that they wo n't get into university because of this exam			0
' baffling : the contested question was worth five marks out of a potential 100 for the whole paper a spokeswoman for @entity5 said : ' we expect that the majority of students will have answered part one of the question correctly , used the ratio that they have calculated and will therefore have had no problems			1
' however , the alternative ratio given in @entity86 ( d ) ( ii ) leads to an answer that is different to what students would normally expect to see			0
' although the question can still be answered , we recognise the alternative ratio given was unhelpful and it has clearly caused confusion for some students			1
' we apologise to these students and accept it would have been better to use a different ratio			0
' she added : ' we would like to reassure students that we have established procedures in place to deal with issues like this			0
' our examiners will take into account the potential for confusion when they mark the papers and will ensure the results of those students who used the alternative ratio are not affected			0

anger over chemistry on tuesday
more than 2,000 students have so far complained about exam on @entity23 page
