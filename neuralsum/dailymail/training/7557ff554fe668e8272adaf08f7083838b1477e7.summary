by @entity0 published : 17:50 est , 13 november 2013 @entity2 : 17:50 est , 13 november 2013 a handsome @entity3 is running his fingers through my hair , whispering in an accent as fruity and seductive as champagne			2
i am melting , nearly purring with pleasure and anticipation , as his fingers , which know me so well , seem to caress my very soul			0
this man instinctively knows when i ’m having a bad day , and how to turn it into a good one			2
he can tease a smile out of me where all else has failed			0
he even knows how - and when - i like my coffee , without even asking			0
special bond : @entity0 has become best of friends with her hairdresser @entity18 but this is not my lover , nor even my husband of 33 years			1
this is my hairdresser , @entity18			1
we have a relationship like no other			2
nothing could have surprised me less than the discovery that it 's not unusual these days for a woman to have a longer relationship with her hairdresser than she does with her husband			1
a survey this week revealed that a woman spends an average of 12 years with her hair stylist and a mere 11 with her partner			1
and , for me , leaving @entity18 would feel like a betrayal or bereavement			1
i honestly see us growing old together			0
a friend recommended him to me when @entity41 , my hairdresser for the previous five years , went through a disastrous divorce and disappeared			1
@entity18 was in his mid- 30s when we met and i was in my late 40s			1
i do n't know whether it was his natural @entity44 charm or if hairdressers , gay or straight ( he 's straight by the way ) , just know how to make a woman feel marvellous			1
but this handsome , casually dressed , dark stunner and i got off on exactly the right foot			0
' every six weeks , i go along for a colour and cut and engaging conversation			0
we 've learned a lot about each other during the hours we have spent together ' he sat me down , ran his fingers expertly through my hair , declared it thick and beautiful ( exactly the right thing to say ) , discussed what kind of style i wanted and what he thought would suit me , and our relationship began			1
at the end of that first visit , in a tiny basement in the middle of @entity67 , decorated in a slightly baroque style - a kind of @entity69 - i knew i had found someone i could trust implicitly with my hair and , as time went on , with worries and concerns that i knew would never be passed on			2
so , every six weeks , i go along for a colour and cut and engaging conversation			0
we 've learned a lot about each other during the hours we have spent together			2
we shared concerns about our ageing parents - mine across the @entity82 , his on the outskirts of @entity85			0
we talked about politics in our respective countries , discussed interesting documentaries we ’d seen or books we 'd read			0
his favourite author is @entity92 and he 's way ahead of me on that one			2
it 's the kind of ever - fresh discussion you 'd hope for on a wonderful date - but without the stress and wretchedness of adultery			1
set for life : it 's not unusual these days for a woman to have a longer relationship with her hairdresser than she does with her husband ( posed by models ) he 's even worked his magic on my son @entity110 when i took him for a haircut as a teenager			1
a francophile like me , when he chose to study @entity114 at @entity115 and then @entity116 , @entity18 became invaluable for oral practice			1
@entity110 now lives in @entity118 , but still takes time to journey north when he needs a cut			0
i ’ve no idea what language they converse in - i hope it 's @entity114			2
i do like to give @entity18 a taste of home with a bit of the old @entity114			1
i greet him with a ' bonjour ! ' and he me with a ' @entity129 ' and a hug			1
he ’s even been known to peck me on both cheeks - very @entity114			0
there are n't many guys who would dare , let alone get away with it			2
it makes me swoon every time			0
he now calls me @entity137 and was quite unaccountably proud when i was awarded the honour two years ago			2
we have never discussed holidays - supposedly the classic hairdresser / client conversation - except when , two years ago , i took my family to @entity143 for the @entity144 and , even then , only after my return			1
' when life got really tough seven or eight years ago , it became clear what we had was a friendship , not just a business arrangement ' it 's true , i think , that no matter how long you 've lived in a foreign country , it 's still your homeland you support			1
@entity18 was so disappointed that @entity3 lost in the final and i was too ashamed to discuss @entity157 's parlous performance			1
over the years , it 's become a less flirtatious relationship , although he still makes the effort to make me feel special every time i walk through the door			1
when life got really tough seven or eight years ago , it became clear what we had was a friendship , not just a business arrangement			2
it was one of the worst times of my life : my parents died , i had breast cancer , chemotherapy and lost my hair			1
@entity18 could not have been more supportive			1
he still managed to make me feel like an appreciated and attractive woman despite the opposite being obviously the case			2
and he was able to flatter and pamper when everyone else to whom i 'm close was too terrified by the possible impact of the disease to think of anything apart from my survival			0
as the hair began to suffer from the chemo , he cut it shorter and shorter , trying to keep some element of style , until it got so bad i called and said i would n't be coming for a while , as i 'd had it all shaved off at home			1
he reassured me it would grow back thicker and bouncier than ever and he 'd be waiting to make me look wonderful again			2
i missed my regular trips to the salon and the relaxing pampering i always get there			0
then , as the hair began to recover , the first question i asked my oncologist was : ' how soon can i get this horrible iron grey dyed ? ' i had n't seen my natural colour for a good 20 years and hated it as it grew back			1
the other man : @entity129 felt guilty when she went to see hairdresser @entity204 ' just get your hairdresser to give it a test in case you 've become sensitive to the dye , ' he said , to my relief			1
' it should be ok now			0
' what a pleasure it was to go back to @entity18			1
walking into the salon felt like an enormous step in my recovery			0
now i could begin to look like myself again and we could get back to our regular routine of colour , cut and conversation			0
slowly , over the years , as we 've both grown older , we 've shared our troubles			1
he does n't have quite as much hair as he used to and his back has caused him endless difficulties - no joke when you 're on your feet all day			1
but still he manages to smile and touch my hair with a sensuous stroke that 's all too rare when you 're not as young as you were			1
so now we ’re not discussing the aches and pains of ageing parents any more , but sympathising with each other ’s			0
there has , though , in recent weeks been a bit of a hiccup			0
the course of true love never did run smooth and i fear i have been unfaithful - cheating on @entity18 with another stylist			1
you may remember the article i wrote about going grey			0
i was sent to the @entity118 hairdresser , @entity204 , to get the colour done			0
top of the crops women aged 75 and over visit hairdressers more often than any other age group while i was sitting in the chair , waiting for a blow dry , a familiar voice cried from across the enormous room - it was @entity41 - the disappeared divorcee			0
she 's still cutting , but in the @entity204 salon			0
it was a glorious reunion , and we spent ages catching up and exchanging news			0
she could n't resist getting out her scissors and giving me a quick , impromptu trim			0
as she snipped away , i had an awful sense of infidelity and i dreaded her making any comment about @entity18 's cut - she did n’t			1
so , i 've agonised over my divided loyalties			0
guiltily , i have been back to @entity41 for a cut , and felt dreadful when @entity18 's partner @entity271 called recently to ask when i 'd next be in			1
i 've made an appointment for the weekend after next			0
i called @entity18 to discuss the colour question			1
i 've been grey for some time now , but would i want the old brunette with highlights ? i explained i 'd become quite attached to the grey , on account of everybody saying it was totally on trend , but would like it to be an elegant silver			0
' ah , oui , ' he said , ' like @entity283 ! so @entity114 ! ' he will , i know , get my hair just right and there was so much relief on both sides in our conversation when i confessed my betrayal			0
' i am so glad you ' ave called , ' he said			0
' @entity271 has been shouting at me			0
where is @entity129 ? what ' ave you done to upset ' er ? now i can explain everysing to ' er. ' i 'm so glad i called , too			2
when it comes to hairdressing , when you get a good ' un , you do n’t let him go ! that 's generally what they say about husbands , but it applies equally to a good hairdresser , the one person who , no matter how awful you feel when you meet , will always make you feel better			2
so , there 's just two weeks to go until my reconciliation with the true love of my life - my hairdresser			2
and i think i 'll love him all the more for accepting me back after such treachery .			0

@entity129 has a wonderful relationship with her hairdresser @entity18
they 've become friends and he 's supported her through some bad times
she was n't surprised to hear a woman spends an average of 12 years with her hair stylist and a mere 11 with her partner
she felt guilty when she recently got her hair done by another hairdresser
