by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the aggressive @entity3 chairman of a @entity5 investigative committee demanded monday that @entity7 commissioner @entity6 explain – in person – how 28 months of emails to and from embattled former official @entity10 were ' lost ' to a computer crash			1
@entity13 rep. @entity12 , who chairs the @entity14 , wrote to @entity6 in reaction to his agency 's claim friday that the @entity7 no longer has copies of emails between @entity10 and anyone outside the @entity7 from january 2009 through april 2011			1
@entity10 is at the center of a scandal involving years of intrusive screening of conservative groups that sought tax - exempt status beginning in 2009			1
hundreds of them saw their applications delayed or denied while politically liberal organizations skated by and quickly received approval			0
@entity12 demanded in his letter on monday that @entity6 appear in a rare evening hearing on june 23 , a half - day before he 's scheduled to testify before the @entity33			2
' i will not tolerate your continued obstruction and game - playing in response to the @entity33 ’s investigation of the @entity7 targeting , ' he wrote			0
' @entity10 officially retired , with a full pension , in late 2013			0
@entity5 @entity3 passed a contempt of @entity58 resolution against her along party lines this year , after she twice refused to testify in open committee hearings			1
legal analysts disagreed about whether she had waived her @entity64 privilege against self - incrimination by giving a lengthy statement during one hearing , in which she claimed she ' broke no laws ' and ' did nothing wrong			0
' it was @entity33 chairman @entity71 , a @entity72 @entity3 congressman , who whipped up a dust storm after the @entity7 first claimed the records were ' lost			1
' the @entity7 informed the committee on friday that many records were not backed up on servers , tapes or external drives			2
its own guidelines require that ' @entity7 officies will not store the official recordkeeping copy of e-mail messages that are federal records only on the electronic mail system			2
' it also requires its offices to back up email messages to ' a separate electronic recordkeeping system			0
' @entity71 and rep. @entity89 , a @entity90 @entity3 who chairs the @entity33 oversight subcommittee , said monday that ' we are simply not going to accept the @entity7 claim that these documents are not recoverable			1
we will demand the president live up to his promise to work " hand in hand " with @entity58 to get the facts			0
' the two lawmakers wrote to president @entity99 on monday , asking for its records of emails between @entity10 and employees the @entity5 , the @entity104 , the @entity105 , the @entity106 , the @entity107 and the @entity108			1
that move came hours after committee staff interviewed government employees charged with running the @entity7 's internal computer networks			1
a committee aide told @entity114 that those @entity7 workers confirmed that budget and space limitations forced the agency to limit officials ' access to networks that would ordinarily store email archives			2
they also said , according to the aide , that other executive branch agencies have their own independent archives of the records now lost at the @entity7			2
@entity71 and @entity89 asked @entity99 to order ' an exhaustive search for all @entity10 emails ' throughout the executive branch			2
@entity3 hope to establish whether or not @entity10 colluded with @entity99 administration officials to play political favorites and single out right - wing groups for special scrutiny			1
but the @entity5 is likely under no obligation to cooperate			0
president @entity99 has already referred to the @entity7 matter as one of several ' phony scandals ' that he believes are politically motivated			0
yet in may 2013 when the scandal first erupted , @entity99 pledged that his administration would ' make sure that we are working hand in hand with @entity58 to get this thing fixed			0
' subpoena : rep. @entity12 is demanding @entity6 show up for an evening interrogation on june 23 the @entity146 threw that phrase back in the president 's face on monday			1
' in order to ensure accountability and “ get this thing fixed , ” please provide ... all communications between @entity10 and any persons within the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) for the period between january 1 , 2009 and may 1 , 2011 , ' they wrote			0
' also , please indicate in writing when the @entity153 [ executive office of the president ] was informed , and by whom , that the @entity7 had lost critical @entity10 documents			1
' in the @entity14 , @entity12 hammered @entity6 for promising in a march 26 hearing that he would deliver every email @entity58 sought			2
at the time , however , he insisted that it would take ' years ' for lawyers to sift through them all and excise private taxpayer information that the @entity7 is n't permitted to share – not even with other arms of government			2
and simply searching through @entity10 's individual email storage , @entity6 said then , would n't produce an exhaustive record			1
' they ’re stored somewhere , ' he explained to @entity171 rep. @entity170 during the hearing			0
' they get taken off and stored in servers and you ’ve got 90 - thousand employees , ' he insisted , but ' we can find , and we are in fact searching – we can find @entity10 ’s emails			1
' at the time , he did n't mention the computer crash which became an overnight butt of jokes among conservatives			0
the @entity187 has the original files , ' @entity186 speechwriter @entity185 tweeted			0
' wonder what the # @entity7 would say if we told them we could n’t submit tax documents because of a computer crash ? ' replied her boss , @entity194 @entity3 sen. @entity3			1
' @entity196 ' game show host @entity197 , who has begun wearing his conservatism on his sleeve in recent years , tweeted : ' weird			0
hundreds of emails to & from someone named @entity10 just showed up in my spam			0

next week will see *brutal* hearings before two @entity5 committees investigating how the @entity7 targeted tea party groups with special scrutiny
one chairman subpoenaed @entity7 commissioner @entity6 on monday
@entity6 testified in march that former official @entity10 's emails were accessible but would take ' years ' in some cases to gather
on friday he told another @entity220 that more than two years ' worth of her emails to and from *people* outside the @entity7 were lost when her computer crashed
but @entity6 has already testified that messages are stored ' on a server ' and not on individual employees ' *pcs*
@entity3 hope to find out if @entity10 colluded with the @entity5 , the @entity105 , the @entity104 or other agencies to play political favorites with the tax code
they are demanding that those *departments* search their own backups to see who @entity10 was communicating with
