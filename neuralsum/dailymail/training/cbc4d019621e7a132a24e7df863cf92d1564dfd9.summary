a group of @entity2 killed and ate their fellow ancient humans , including young children , scientists have found			1
using modern forensics techniques , including dna analysis , the researchers found that 12 @entity2 , all from the same family , had been eaten by their peers			1
in research presented to the @entity11 in @entity12 , biologist @entity13 , said that the bones of the victims had been cracked open to extract the marrow , while the skulls were opened so brains and tongues could be eaten			0
butchered : scientists have found that a family of @entity2 were killed and eaten by their fellow ancient humans ( file picture ) remains , discovered at the @entity27 cave system , near @entity28 , in north western @entity29 , included the bones of three female and three male adults , three teenage boys and three children aged between two and nine - years - old			1
' all had been butchered , ' mr @entity35 told the @entity11 on thursday , according to the @entity36			0
' it must have been a big feast			0
we think @entity2 groups were about 10 - 12 strong so this may have been a complete family group , although someone may have got away			1
' discovery : the @entity2 remains were discovered accidentally at @entity27 in northern @entity29 in 1994 researchers had considered whether the cannibalised neanderthals had been killed by modern humans , although this was ruled out when dating techniques revealed that the remains pre-dated homo - sapiens in @entity29 by thousands of years			1
by analysing the stone tools used by the killers the scientists found that they had probably come from a few miles away , leading them to conclude that the culprits were probably neanderthals from a neighbouring group			1
revealed : scientists used the most recent scientific advances , including dna sequencing , to find out details such as the hair colour of the @entity2			1
pictured is a model of a neanderthal man ' i would guess they were killed in winter when food was short			0
there is no evidence of any fire so they were eaten raw immediately and every bit of meat was consumed			0
they even cut around the mandibles of the jaw to extract the tongues , ' said mr @entity35			0
he said that as @entity2 lived in smaller groups this may have made them liable to eat each other when no other food sources could be found , rather than modern humans who lived in larger groups and worked together in tougher times			2
the remains were accidentally discovered by cave explorers in 1994 , with systematic excavations starting in 2000			2
in total 13 individuals have been retrieved in a painstaking operation designed to prevent contamination of the remains with modern human dna			0
due to the cold temperatures in the cave , which is 60ft underground , and its remote location , the neanderthals @entity94 was preserved for centuries , and had not come into contact with the dna of other neanderthals , animals , or humans			0
. the bones were found mixed up with gravel and mud in a small cave gallery , some 700ft from the entrance			0
mr @entity35 , of the @entity109 in @entity110 , said he believed the victims had been slaughtered in a rock shelter situated above where the remains were found , their flesh stripped from the bones , which were then dumped			1
he said that a powerful storm had then washed the bones , stone tools and sediments down a gap in the rock and into the cave where they were eventually discovered			2
mr @entity35 was able to use the most recent scientific advances , including dna sequencing , to see reconstruct the @entity2 ' genes , leading to information being uncovered about their hair colour and blood group .			2

scientists used modern forensic techniques to analyse ancient remains
bones were discovered in a deep cave , and had been stripped of meat
@entity2 family , including a child of two , were killed and eaten
killers believed to be from a neighbouring tribe
