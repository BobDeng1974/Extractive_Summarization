controversial letters sent to @entity4 fugitives granting them an amnesty from prosecution may have been illegal , a damning @entity1 report has found			1
a commons select committee said the so - called ‘ comfort letters ’ , which assured 187 @entity10 terror suspects they were no longer being hunted by the police , should never have been written			1
in a highly - critical report , it said the ‘ one - sided secretive scheme ’ – which victims said effectively handed paramilitary fighters ' get out of jail free ' cards – had damaged the integrity of the @entity17 criminal justice system			1
at least 95 recipients were linked to almost 300 murders			1
but the letters – sent to the so - called ‘ on the runs ’ after pressure from @entity41 – only came to light during the trial of @entity45 , the man accused of the @entity47 bombing in 1982			1
the trial collapsed in february last year when it emerged the 63 - year - old had been told he would not face prosecution for the blast that killed four soldiers and seven horses in @entity54			0
a review by @entity56 concluded in july that the letter scheme , established as part of the peace process , was not unlawful but that there were ' significant failures ' in how it operated			0
@entity17 's then prime minister @entity28 ( @entity63 ) meets @entity41 leader @entity64 ( r ) , and chief negotiator @entity65 in 2005 - the letters were sent to so - called ‘ on the runs ’ after pressure from @entity41 but today the @entity69 ’ @entity68 published a blistering report raising serious questions about the legality of the highly - divisive scheme			1
the report said : ‘ it is questionable whether the ' on - the - runs ' ( @entity77 ) scheme was lawful or not , but we believe its existence distorted the legal process			2
‘ we accept that there was a difficult peace process going on at the time , but believe that there still has to be transparency and accountability in government and in the legal process			0
’ it found that ‘ damage has undoubtedly been done to public confidence in the criminal justice system ’			1
the committee , which took evidence from 55 witnesses , including ex-prime minister mr @entity28 , also blasted the decision not to appeal the @entity45 ruling this had placed ‘ preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system over the public interest involved in continuing the trial of someone accused of carrying out multiple murders , ’ it said			1
@entity4 terror suspect @entity45 ( pictured ) was wrongly sent an immunity letter causing his trial for for the 1982 @entity47 bombing to collapse the report also said the people of @entity68 had been ‘ kept in the dark to the greatest possible extent ’ by the government			2
the report said that during the peace process , @entity41 had pushed for ‘ comfort letters ’ to be issued and had received promises from mr @entity28			1
but while working hard to ensure those pledges were kept , mr @entity28 did so without telling other @entity68 party leaders about the exact nature of the scheme , the report said			2
committee chairman @entity123 said the victims of the @entity36 and their families had been ‘ let down ’			0
he said : ‘ our priority is to serve the victims and their relatives , whom we believe to have been let down by @entity129 by the way in which this scheme has operated			0
‘ if any scheme had been put in place at all , which is questionable , it should have been properly introduced and correctly administered			0
it also should have been open and transparent			0
this scheme was none of those things			0
‘ regardless of the intentions , this scheme has caused further hurt to people who have suffered far too much already , and has led to further suspicions being raised			0
’ the report branded ‘ wholly unacceptable ’ the government 's failure to identify those @entity4 members who had been charged or convicted who obtained @entity149 during the peace process			2
@entity68 secretary @entity151 has reiterated that the government was no longer standing by the ‘ on the run ’ letters and that those who had received them could no longer rely on them as a defence			2
it comes after six @entity4 terror suspects thought to be behind some of the worst atrocities committed on mainland @entity17 are facing major new police investigations despite receiving letters granting them immunity			1
a @entity167 spokesman said : ‘ the letters were only ever a statement of the facts as they were understood at the time , as to whether or not an individual was wanted for questioning by the police			0
‘ they were not intended to preclude investigation or prosecution based on new evidence emerging , or on the basis of a fresh assessment of the existing evidence			0
the government is today repeating its statement that recipients of the letters should cease to place any reliance on them			2

letters sent to @entity4 fugitives granting them amnesty may have been illegal
