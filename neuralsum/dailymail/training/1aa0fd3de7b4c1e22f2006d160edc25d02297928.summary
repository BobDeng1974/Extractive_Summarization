by @entity0 published : 21:02 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 06:50 est , 10 january 2014 she 's brilliant in her latest film ... apparently : @entity4 next month , all eyes will turn to the @entity6 in @entity8 ’s @entity7 for the glittering annual @entity10 film awards ceremony			1
on february 16 , the great and the good of the film world will walk the ( usually somewhat soggy ) red carpet , and prizes will be handed out for best actor and actress , @entity17 and , the biggie , the @entity19 of 2013			1
a bafta is one of the most prestigious prizes in the business , and winning one represents the pinnacle of most people ’s careers			1
even being nominated can catapult you into the major league			1
and so you would imagine that the 6,500 - strong voting membership of the @entity10 has a thoughtful , fair and well - considered procedure for choosing the five nominees in each category ( announced last wednesday ) and then for picking the ultimate winner			1
as a @entity10 voter for many years i can reveal that the voting process is based less on artistic merit than on a combination of coercion , trend - following and pot luck			1
here ’s how it works			2
maybe 100 films released over the past 12 months have a realistic chance of winning a @entity10 , and probably 70 to 80 of those are released in the last two months of the year			1
distributors seem to think @entity10 voters have short memories and , given the average age of the @entity10 voter — there are a lot of retired film people in the @entity10 — they might be right			1
so , around november , you start getting invited to screenings and q&a sessions with cast and crew			2
gone are the days of the lavish dinners and all - expenses - paid jollies — but you are certainly looked after			1
a complimentary glass of champagne			2
not an inducement , of course			2
but we hope you enjoyed the film			2
these events are expensive to put on			2
so already the field of competitors is being narrowed down to the @entity76 studios with their big marketing budgets			2
they will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars putting adverts in the trade press , targeting voters with what are known as ‘ @entity84 ’ ads — inviting academy members to consider voting for their films and their stars			1
how can a low - budget independent film compete against that ? and while everyone wants to see films on the big screen , that ’s not always possible			1
not everyone lives in @entity8 , for one thing			2
so , as the year draws to a close , you start receiving ‘ screeners ’			2
these dvds are one of the great perks of being a @entity10 member , and mean you can watch the main awards contenders in the comfort of your own home			1
previous winners : @entity108 and dame @entity109 who have both won @entity10 but still , you now have 50 or 60 films to get through			1
in less than a month			2
with @entity112 in the middle			2
and a deadline of january 3 to vote for your five nominations in each category			2
it ’s just not possible to watch them all			2
so which ones rise to the top of the pile ? the ones you ’ve already heard about			2
and the ones that have already started winning			2
from late november onwards , reviewers and film critic groups start to publish their ‘ @entity127 ’ lists			2
the @entity128 is an early big one at the start of december , followed by the @entity130 a few days later , and the @entity132 nominations a week after that			0
( can you see a pattern emerging ? the @entity136 are already setting the pace			0
) this year , films such as @entity138 got a lot of early momentum			0
other much - hyped films such as @entity143 or august : @entity144 started to fall away			1
@entity146 from 12 years a slave was hailed early on as a shoo - in for @entity147 , and now looks set to claim the @entity10			1
old favourite @entity148 was hailed the comeback king for his best actor role in the little - seen @entity152 , and sure enough he has bagged a @entity10 nomination			1
so , very quickly , the front - runners are anointed			1
and they ride that wave all the way to the @entity10 and beyond			1
and we follow the sheep in front of us			0
and the little guys fall by the wayside			0
but the days are still ticking by , and you still have all these films to watch , and you ’ve been meaning to get to them but you ca n’t , and there are all these obvious front - runners			1
and so you do it			0
you vote for a film you have n’t seen			0
bafta voting guidelines state explicitly that you must only vote for films you have seen			1
but i ’ve done it			0
and i bet everyone else has , too			0
you vote for the ones you think are going to win			0
it ’s why the same old names appear year after year			0
on february 16 , the great and the good of the film world will walk the red carpet , before @entity185 are handed out @entity109 could blow her nose and she ’d get nominated ( she famously won a @entity10 for her eight minutes of screen time as @entity188 in @entity189 )			1
@entity194 , hmm , she was n’t in a movie this year , can i vote for her anyway ? are these really the crowning performances of their careers ? no , but they ’ll get nominated anyway			0
and because we ’re @entity203 we ’ll throw a few bones to @entity203 films such as @entity206 ( about a woman ’s search for her long - lost son ) or the motor - racing drama @entity211 — both wonderful movies , as it happens , but a little national pride goes a long way at the @entity10			1
@entity216 is done online now , and it takes five minutes			0
click , click , click			0
i voted for @entity4 because apparently she ’s amazing in @entity220 ’s @entity219			0
and it ’ll be great if she turns up to the awards			0
and having @entity220 films on the shortlist makes @entity10 look smarter			1
@entity4 ’s practically @entity203 anyway			0
and i ’m sure i ’ll get round to seeing it one day			0
i have n’t seen @entity227 but everyone knows @entity226 is a film - making genius and i have no doubt that his latest is up to his usual breathtakingly high standard			1
click , click , send			0
you back winners , and winners are the ones with momentum , and momentum is generated by marketing muscle , pure and simple			1
hang on , you say			0
how does @entity242 , a @entity243 black - and - white film with no dialogue , win the @entity10 for @entity245 in 2012 ? exactly the same way , with momentum			1
the king of the ‘ @entity249 ’ is @entity136 mogul @entity250 , who , along with his brother @entity251 , has helped his films win 75 @entity253 in the past 20 years			0
he saw the artist , bought it , and ran a textbook campaign , pitching it as ‘ the @entity257 ’			0
boy , could it ever			0
there are two problems at play here			0
the first is this insistence on pushing out every quality movie in the last two months of the year			0
it overloads us , and leaves cinemas empty of decent material the rest of the time			0
the @entity273 , the @entity274 , the @entity271 for art can all take a year ’s worth of work and examine it in a more considered fashion , and with an element of perspective			0
ca n’t the film industry do the same ? but the second is more worrying			0
@entity10 is still happy — desperate even — to be seen as the @entity253 ’ younger brother , the penultimate awards ceremony in a months - long bandwagon leading up to the big daddy			1
so @entity76 stars turn up to a ceremony they might otherwise avoid , and tv ratings boom			0
it ’s why we work to these crazy timelines , why we still vote for so many @entity136 movies in the @entity293 , and why relatively few home - grown films get recognised			1
surely we are a big enough country to define for ourselves what is worthy of praise , rather than following the lead of the @entity136 ? but maybe the system does work , after all			1
i voted for 12 years a slave in several categories and i confidently predict it will win big at both the @entity10 and the @entity253			1
as it should — considering it ’s the best film of the year			0
at least , so i ’m told .			0

the @entity10 will take place on february 16
the winners are picked by 6,500 - strong voting membership
*whistleblower* says the system is based on trend - following and pot luck
