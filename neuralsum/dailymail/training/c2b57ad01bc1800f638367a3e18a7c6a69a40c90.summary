by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 13:47 est , 3 september 2013 from @entity2 and @entity3 to @entity5 cakes and even butter - it seems there is n't a food that avant garde chefs have n't tried to coat in batter and deep fry to create a less - than - healthy snack			0
but fast food chain @entity14 has taken gastronomical experimentation to the next level - by deep frying soup			2
the chicken chain is set to introduce its unusual version of a popular soup dish to its menu in @entity21			2
experimental : @entity14 @entity21 is releasing a deep - fried version of corn potage , a type of popular soup the company is looking to cash in on the nation 's latest culinary obsession - a creamy soup known as corn potage			1
but instead of serving it in bowls with a spoon , the chain will somehow cover it in its usual secret recipe batter and fry it			0
the snack will go on sale on thursday and will be available for a limited time only , say @entity14 @entity21 bosses			1
a @entity14 source told @entity44 : ' we bread the corn potage and cook it to a crisp			1
' though the batter turns solid , the inside of the fritter stays soft and creamy			0
corn potage is a little thicker than normal soup which is how chefs were able to fry it in the first place without creating a gunky mess			1
new snack : @entity14 will be selling the fritter for a limited period after it goes on sale in @entity21 from thursday the dish has become a common fixture in @entity21 cafes and it has proved so popular that a popsicle company has expanded its line - up to include a corn potage flavour			1
the product went on to become such a hit with consumers that stores could n't keep up with demand			0
corn potage is not the first unusual food stuff to be deep fried			1
in 2010 , a takeaway in @entity5 , @entity76 , created an 800 calorie snack by battering the town 's most famous export - the @entity5 cake			0
a @entity83 couple 's restaurant specialising in deep frying a range of already high calorie @entity87 foods also took @entity89 by storm in the same year			0
it seems that nothing was safe from the deep fat fryer in @entity94 and @entity97 's restaurant - deep fried hamburger , pretzels and even cheesecake were on the menu .			2

deep fried corn potage will go on sale for a limited period from thursday
the creamy soup is covered in batter and ' fried to a crisp ' , says @entity14
the soup is so popular in @entity21 it has even been made into a popsicle
