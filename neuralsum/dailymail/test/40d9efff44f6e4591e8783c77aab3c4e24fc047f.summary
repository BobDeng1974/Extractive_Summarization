two more games ; that ’s all it will take			2
two more games and @entity4 will have confirmed his mastery of the @entity6 with a third title in five attempts at the trophy and @entity10 will be crowned champions			1
the clue that this was the decisive game was in the manic nature of the second half			2
not on the pitch , but on the touchline			0
@entity4 and his assistant @entity17 were up and down with unusual intensity , even for them , waving players back with the most extravagant gestures when they lost the ball			1
hold on to this lead , was the implicit message , and a huge step will have been taken to the ultimate goal			1
in fact , as @entity28 played at the end of the game and the players congregated in the centre circle , there was a sense that the celebrations were already in swing			0
@entity10 forward @entity37 ( second from left ) slots the ball past @entity40 goalkeeper @entity39 to open the scoring hazard 's low shot squirms past @entity44 as defenders @entity46 ( left ) and @entity47 watch on helplessly hazard wheels away to celebrate his 13th @entity6 goal of the season as @entity44 slowly rises to his feet after conceding a tv camera gets a close - up of the goalscorer as @entity43 celebrates with @entity55 in front of a section of home fans at @entity59 @entity10 : @entity60 6 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 7 , @entity63 6.5 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 5.5 , @entity66 7 , @entity67 8 ( @entity68 6 , 67 ) , @entity69 6 ( @entity70 92 ) , @entity43 8.5 ( @entity71 94 ) , @entity55 5 subs not used : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 goal : hazard booked : @entity61 , @entity55 , @entity67 manager : @entity4 7 @entity40 : @entity80 6.5 , @entity81 6 , @entity46 6.5 , @entity47 6.5 , @entity82 7 ( @entity83 80 ) , @entity84 6 , @entity85 5 ( @entity86 5 , 70 ) , @entity87 7.5 , @entity88 6.5 , @entity89 ( @entity90 6 , 70 ) , @entity91 4 subs not used : @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 booked : @entity87 manager : @entity98 6 @entity99 : hazard referee : @entity102 6 attendance : 41,442 * @entity105 ratings by @entity106 at @entity59 @entity37 opened the scoring for @entity10 - click here for more in our @entity109 two more games of course have to be won and that includes a visit to @entity115 next week			1
but there can be little doubt as to the destination of the title after this result			2
the hard work of the winter has been done			0
@entity4 was haveing none of it of course , rightly so , insisting they need eight points			1
they need nine , actually , to be sure , but beat @entity115 next week and then they will need just three more			0
‘ if the celebration is because we beat one the biggest clubs in the world , i understand that , ’ he said			0
‘ if the celebration is because the players gave everything to win that game and they feel the result of the work they did this week , then i also understand that			1
‘ but if they are celebrating something more than that – not at all			0
every point we get is one step in the title direction but no more than that			0
’ yet though @entity10 were on the back foot for much of the game , though @entity40 did play well , the champions elect were worth their win not least in the fact that they were more or less in control of their destiny and they had the outstanding player on the pitch in @entity37			1
when he nut - megged @entity39 for the opening goal , it was as though the race to be player of the season – they are both shortlisted for the award - had become a personal feud			1
the finish was both ruthless and decisive , an indication of how far he has grown			0
but he was not alone			0
the team approached their task with the cold , quite professionalism required of champions ; not all titles are won at a canter with a spring in the step			0
sometimes getting across the line is enough hand			0
@entity40 midfielder @entity87 is sent flying by a tackle from @entity10 star @entity67 on saturday evening @entity10 striker @entity55 ( left ) attempts to steal the ball from @entity40 's in - form wing back @entity89 @entity40 midfielder @entity88 ( left ) tussles with @entity10 defender @entity61 during the first half @entity40 captain @entity84 finds himself surrounded by @entity66 , @entity69 and @entity43 hazard gets up close and personal with some @entity10 fans after missing an opportunity to give his side a two - goal lead @entity198 striker @entity55 bursts past @entity40 defender @entity46 as @entity10 continue their pursuit of the @entity6 title @entity98 felt his team , shorn of @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 , deserved more			1
‘ i ’m very proud of my team , ’ he said			0
‘ we played the best match this season but in football you can lose in spite of you being the better team			0
‘ it 's amazing how we have played here			2
when you have seen the statistics , it 's unbelievable that the result is 1 - 0			1
we count it that we have made a big step forward in our process			2
but for the fans , they have lost			0
‘ we were always in our opponent 's half			2
in spite of the difference and despite @entity10 's defensive organisation , we have created more chances			1
that 's an unbelievable performance – but , read the score			1
’ @entity4 had the perfect riposte to that			1
‘ the game was exactly what we wanted			0
when we manage to play the game we want to play , it 's fantastic			2
the game was exactly what we were working for the game to be			0
’ the truth was somewhere inbetween those two analyses			0
@entity4 would not have wanted the challenge @entity63 made in the final moments of added time , in which @entity244 trailed his leg into the clumsy tackle and fell			1
@entity87 received a yellow card for diving – and @entity4 made much play of how his players might have been accused had they done the same – but another referee might easily have given a penalty			1
@entity40 midfielder @entity87 knocks the ball past @entity10 defender @entity63 inside the home side 's box @entity87 sticks out his right leg to make contact with @entity63 before falling to the ground and appealing for a penalty in the 95th minute @entity63 and @entity87 go head - to - head after the @entity40 man was penalised for diving late on at @entity59 @entity10 boss @entity4 gestures on the @entity59 touchline as he watches his side take on @entity40 @entity40 striker @entity91 ( left ) controls the ball as @entity10 's makeshift midfielder @entity65 keeps a close eye on him referee @entity102 is surrounded by @entity40 players as the visitors complain about a decision going against them hazard almost made it 2 - 0 with an acrobatic , close - range shot but his effort hit the bar after surging run forward from @entity55 former @entity40 boss sir @entity278 watches his old club lose 1 - 0 to @entity10 from the stands at @entity59 likewise when @entity82 , a constant worry to @entity282 , played in @entity91 and he smashed the ball against the post on 76 minutes , that would not have been in the @entity4 game plan			1
nor the moment when @entity82 found @entity84 in the fourth minute and the captain curled the ball wide when he really should have scored			2
that said , though @entity40 dominated midfield with @entity87 and @entity84 , @entity10 had the better chances			1
having conceded much of the possession , @entity62 muscled @entity91 off the ball – a foul according to @entity98 – and found @entity67 on 37 minutes , whose impudent back heel saw @entity43 set off like with an intent that would not be denied			1
his touch and finish was that of a man wholly sure of himself			0
@entity87 then blotted his copy book , with a wayward pass on 53 minutes , seized on by @entity55 , sprinting goal - wards			1
@entity46 made enough of a nuisance of himself to ensure that shot was deflected over @entity39			2
hazard was on hand , tearing in at far post , but , unable to break his stride for a simple finish , he instead flicked the ball and hit the post			2
nevertheless , you were left marvelling at the @entity314			0
he reminds you of @entity315 when @entity115 were closing in on the title in 2002			0
it is n’t just that his speed terrorises or that his skill is above that of almost every player on the pitch			2
it is his state of mind that is so dangerous , that intuitive confidence great players possess ; the knowledge that they have the capacity to change the game at any point			0
