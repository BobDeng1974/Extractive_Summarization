the lead singer of the @entity2 band @entity3 has always managed to retain her size eight figure @entity6 has never had to watch her weight			1
the lead singer of the @entity2 band @entity3 has always been the envy of her friends because she managed to retain her size eight figure without much effort			1
but when she was 53 , all that changed and the 5ft 4in singer of the hits @entity14 and @entity15 put on 2st in a year , taking her from 7½ st to 9½ st. and no matter what she tried , she could n't shift it			1
' cutting back on carbs and spending more time in the gym just were n't working , ' she says			2
' i was two years into my menopause , so i thought : " this is it - you hit your 50s , you kiss goodbye to your waistline and turn into a sphere			1
" ' but that was n't the only change she 'd noticed			2
' i started to feel uncommonly tired all the time , ' says @entity6 , now 57			1
' after concerts i 'd be shattered and i did n't want to do anything except go to sleep			2
at home , by 3pm i was done for the day			2
' my children were 12 and eight and i needed my energy for them			2
i found i needed to sleep eight to ten hours a day , but i never got that because of my busy life and school - age kids			1
' initially , she blamed this on the menopause , too			1
but after a year without any improvement , her husband , @entity43 , 50 , encouraged her to seek medical advice			1
her doctor agreed that the tiredness could be due to the menopause , but also gave her a blood test for anaemia			1
@entity6 had been anaemic during her pregnancies			2
' the breathlessness and general lethargy were similar , ' she says			2
however , the test came back clear			1
still feeling exhausted , she asked for more tests - and a simple blood test finally pinpointed not just the cause of her tiredness , but her weight gain , too : @entity6 has a severely underactive thyroid gland			1
it 's a common problem and @entity6 's not the only one to confuse the symptoms with the menopause			1
about one in 50 women and one in 1,000 men have an underactive thyroid gland , also known as hypothyroidism			1
but @entity70 , chief executive of the charity @entity72 , says the figures could be far higher , as many people are n't going to their gp , often putting their symptoms down to the time of life or 21st - century fatigue			2
hypothyroidism stems from a problem with the thyroid gland in the neck , reducing the amount of the hormone thyroxine it produces			1
' the thyroid gland regulates your metabolism , so if it becomes underactive , lots of things in the body slow down or do n't work very well , ' says @entity92 , a surgeon at the @entity93			1
' as a result , people feel much more tired than usual			1
they also put on weight and often feel cold			1
their gut slows down so they become constipated and they may become prone to dry skin , thinning hair and muscle or joint pain			0
' some people also have a vague brain fog or feel depressed			0
' hypothyroidism can occur at any stage in life - babies can be born with it - but it most commonly occurs in women between the ages of 40 and 50			0
at this age , some presume their symptoms are just a part of the menopause or getting older			1
but when she was 53 , she went from from 7½ st to 9½ st in a year , and began feeling tired all the time ' the chief difference is that hypothyroidism does not cause hot flushes as the menopause does , ' says mr @entity92			1
' normally , the hypothyroidism symptoms will become more extreme : they may develop a puffy face , a deepening of their voice or even goitre ( a swelling in the neck )			0
' any woman who has unremitting unexplained fatigue should seek a blood test to rule out a thyroid issue			1
' early diagnosis is preferable because if left untreated hypothyroidism can increase the risk of heart disease			0
this is because it encourages an increase in levels of bad ldl cholesterol , which can block arteries			0
quite why the thyroid gland should suddenly struggle to produce enough thyroxine during middle age , or at any point in life , is unclear			1
' it may be genetics , as it does tend to run in families , and it may also be hormonal as it does tend to affect women more			0
or it could be that the thyroid gland just winds down with age , ' says mr @entity92			1
' the most likely reason is a combination of all these things			0
' however , there are some acknowledged causes			0
often it can be caused by an autoimmune attack , which means that the body 's immune system produces antibodies that attack the thyroid gland			1
some medications , such as the heart rhythm drug amiodarone and some steroids , can suppress the action of the thyroid gland			1
pregnancy , which puts pressure on the thyroid to produce more thyroxine , can also temporarily induce hypothyroidism			1
the condition can be picked up by a blood test that checks for levels of @entity183 , thyroid stimulating hormone			1
high levels suggest the thyroid may not be working effectively , as it is having to be driven hard by the @entity183 to push out adequate amounts of thyroxine			2
sometimes a blood test may also be given to check for levels of thyroxine , also called @entity192			1
' some people have what we call subclinical hypothyroidism , which means their @entity183 is high , but their @entity192 is normal , and some people have symptoms , even though their tsh and @entity192 levels are fine , ' says mr @entity92			0
' it is not a clear cut area and different doctors have different attitudes to this			0
i normally treat these people with @entity206 ( a synthetic form of the thyroxine hormone ) and see if the symptoms improve			0
' levothyroxine is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism			0
@entity6 has been on levothyroxine since her diagnosis in 2011 , though she was initially reluctant to take tablets			0
' i do n't like taking medicine if i can avoid it , ' says @entity6 , who lives with her family in @entity217			0
' i told my doctor : " i know you 're going to prescribe thyroxine , but i 've been on the internet and i 'm concerned about the potential side - effects			0
" ' these include headaches , diarrhoea , chest pain , feeling restless , temporary hair loss , muscle cramps , an itchy rash and trouble sleeping			2
' when i asked my doctor what would happen if i did n't take the medication , she replied : " your heartbeat will get slower and slower over the years until one day it will stop and you will die			0
" ' @entity6 has been on levothyroxine ( a synthetic form of the thyroxine hormone ) since her diagnosis in 2011 despite her fears , @entity6 concedes she felt better within a week of starting the treatment			0
' i 've not felt any side - effects			0
in fact , i 've only felt better			0
getting my energy back was paramount			0
before it was a struggle just going about my day and making it through to the evening			0
i began to dread performing as i could barely stay awake or summon up the energy or enthusiasm to do it			2
but since being on thyroxine , i 've not had such problems and feel like i did before the symptoms started			0
i feel and look more like my old self			0
i 'm 9st , and i 'd like to get under that so i can wear my lovely old clothes again			0
' just why she developed hypothyroidism is unclear , but there may be a genetic link			0
@entity6 's mother , @entity260 , who died from renal failure in 2014 aged 78 , also developed an underactive thyroid in her 60s			1
the diagnosis has n't altered my lifestyle or habits , but if i feel tired i get a bit paranoid as to why and then i remind myself everyone gets tired , ' she says			2
@entity6 is moving a bit slower than normal - but only because she is using crutches and an air boot , having fractured her right ankle after falling while rehearsing			0
' it was a serious injury : apparently , i 've been lucky not to lose blood supply and have the bone die			2
the biggest tragedy is having to go on - stage in flats			0
' i ca n't move too much in case i wrench my ankle , so i jig about from the hips up			0
i never drink before a show but , because my ankle is weak , i 'll suddenly totter off to the right and i 'm sure the audience is thinking " hello ? ! " ' as far as her condition is concerned , she says : ' as long as my thyroid behaves itself , i should be fine			2
at my age , you get more out of life if you 're sensible			0
