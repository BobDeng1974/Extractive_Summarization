by @entity0 welcome to @entity2 's first ' luxury ' ski resort - which actually looks a little more like a prison camp than the slopes @entity5			1
the @entity7 ski resort , near @entity8 , opened for business earlier this year			1
previously , it was home to a clear mountainside covered in lime trees			0
now it is a sprawling 1,400 - hectare resort - complete with several expansive eating areas , uncomfortable - looking ski lifts and , of course , screens showing pro-government propaganda			1
the @entity7 resort is set over a sprawling 1,400 - hectare site and includes 70 miles ( 110km ) of multi-level slopes a group of nervous looking visitors squeeze on to a basic - looking ski lift at the ' luxury ' resort hundreds of empty ski lifts service the abandoned slopes which were visited by @entity33 in december two happy ski - ers wave and smile at the camera as they make their way up to the top of the slopes a ski-less @entity33 surveys the snowy surroundings during his visit at the end of last year hundreds of snow canons are used to keep the resort 's 110 kilometres ( 70 miles ) of multi-level slopes looking their best			1
those visiting may wish to stay in the resort 's elaborate hotel - which has a large swimming pool and a much more modest bar			2
in pictures taken by @entity54 newspaper @entity53 's @entity55 , ski - iers appear to be having a wonderful time on the @entity58 slopes - and wave and laugh at at camera			2
the @entity2 leader @entity33 visited the @entity7 resort in december - testing out the lifts while surveying his surroundings			1
he , however , appeared to forget one rather vital item - and was pictured with his ski - free legs dangling below as he made his way up the mountains			0
@entity70 dressed ski - ers slalom in perfect unity towards the resort 's hotel ( pictured top centre ) a outbuilding at the resort - which features a hotel with swimming pool and bar as well as several industrial - looking eating areas a line of piste workers holsing snow shovels and wearing their dark uniforms on their way to work snow canons , used to keep the resort operating at its very best , line one of the empty slopes one of several screen dotted around the slopes which play propaganda to visitors another screen playing a propaganda film - which is rather ominously protected by tens of snow cannons at the time , the leader was said to note ' with great satisfaction ' that everything was ' impeccable '			1
he also gave instructions to serve visitors to the site well - and ensure visitors may ' keenly feel the loving care of the party ' , local media reported			0
the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) described the slopes as a ' great monumental structure in the era of @entity115 ' , referring to the nation 's ' military first ' policy			0
the military also played a leading role in the project			0
@entity33 was accompanied by top military leaders and , @entity122 , a top sports official known to be associated with @entity33 's uncle who was executed last year			0
a sign detailing how high each slope is stands in front of an empty ski lift a orange - clad visitor skis down the mountainous slopes - which until a year ago were just home to lime trees the imposing @entity7 resort hotel			1
the accommodation features a swimming pool and a modest bar visitors gather and eat at an improvised apres - ski barbecue area two holidaymakers walk through the lobby of the hotel and towards the reception the expansive lobby is finished in a garish manner - with plenty of harsh lighting and imposing columns @entity148 , @entity33 's powerful political mentor , was put to death in a shock purge on charges including corruption and plotting to overthrow the state			1
the purge was the biggest political upheaval since @entity33 , aged around 30 , took power after the death of his father and longtime ruler , @entity160 , in december 2011			0
the resort made headlines in august when @entity163 blocked a $ 7.6 million sale of ski lifts to @entity166 , calling it a ' propaganda project ' for the impoverished @entity169 regime			2
the young leader has shown a fondness for expensive , high - profile leisure projects in and around the showpiece capital @entity166 including a massive new water park , an amusement park and a luxury horseback riding club			2
a waitress waits to greet visitors wishing to enjoy a drink at the resort 's modest bar the brown and beige - and empty - indoor dining room located in the hotel the empty swimming pool of the hotel where guests may wish to relax after their hard day on the slopes a resort worker patiently waits for customers to collect their ski boots , ready for a day on the slopes a group make a visit to the ski rental area of the hotel the @entity198 in @entity166 opened in october to much fanfare , with the 109,000 - square metre venue sporting dozens of indoor and outdoor pools , water slides and saunas			1
@entity33 in september also watched films at a new ' 4d ' movie theatre built in the newly - renovated @entity208 's amusement park , state media reported earlier			0
he was photographed riding a roller coaster in the @entity211 amusement park in @entity166 when it reopened in july 2012 after renovations ordered by @entity33			0
@entity33 inspecting his ' pet project ' , near @entity8 in @entity2 with top officials back in december			0
