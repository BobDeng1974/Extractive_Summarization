@entity0 will head into tomorrow 's @entity1 holding a giant psychological edge over @entity3 after sending his team - mate , and biggest rival for the title , into a spin on saturday - quite literally			1
@entity0 was in electric form throughout saturday 's qualifying session topping the timesheets in @entity11 , @entity12 , and crucially when it mattered , in @entity14			2
and his dominance in the damp conditions seemingly got under the skin of @entity3 who was ragged throughout			0
in a spin : @entity3 will start from the second row after a number of mistakes during qualifying in @entity24 difficult day at the office : @entity3 will start only on the second row after rival @entity0 secured pole the @entity28 , who still leads @entity0 in the championship by 11 points , ran wide on his very first out - lap which set the tone for the remainder of qualifying			1
after seeing @entity0 go one second clear following their respective first runs in @entity14 , @entity3 made a complete hash of his next attempt at pole , running deep at turn 14 – he had been fastest in the first two sectors – before spinning on the exit of the final corner on the following lap. @entity3 later claimed he took a ' big risk ' on his final timed lap after his steering wheel informed him he was two tenths down on his personal best when he was actually half - a - second quicker			1
as a result he will start from the second row and behind both @entity51 tomorrow , and faces an uphill challenge to prevent @entity0 winning once more			2
on track : @entity0 excelled in the tricky conditions to secure his third pole of the campaign so far @entity0 can now lay claim to being the greatest qualifier ever to emerge from these shores			2
the 29 - year - old surpassed @entity64 's record with his 34th career pole in @entity66 , with now only @entity67 ( 45 ) , @entity68 ( 65 ) and @entity69 ( 68 ) ahead of him on the all - time list			1
the impressive achievement was somewhat lost on the @entity72 afterwards , however			0
when informed of his new record , @entity0 claimed : ' oh , really ? i did n't know that			2
' a dose of short - term memory loss from @entity78 perhaps , considering he talked in such glowing terms of matching @entity64 's record in @entity82 three weeks ago			1
' when they mentioned it , i could n't believe it , ' said @entity0 after securing pole - position in @entity87			2
' i 'd never have dreamed i would have the amount of poles i have			0
' centre of attention : @entity0 will start on pole ahead of @entity93 ( left ) and @entity67 @entity93 maintained his impressive start to his @entity96 career after out - qualifying team - mate @entity67 for the third time in just four races			1
incredibly , it means the young @entity99 has now got the better of @entity67 more times this season than @entity102 managed throughout the entirety of 2013			2
we perhaps should n't be surprised by @entity93 's one - lap pace – he often impressed at @entity106 , too , only to flatter to deceive on race day – while we must acknowledge too that @entity67 suffered with car issues in both @entity99 and in @entity109			1
nevertheless , this remains a strong season for the @entity99 , indeed he would have been third in the championship without his disqualification from the campaign opener in @entity115			0
life in the fast lane : @entity93 has been hugely impressive in his debut season for @entity96 the hugely anticipated @entity119 vs @entity121 duel at @entity122 has been somewhat of a damp squib so far			0
@entity121 has only seven points to his name – compared to the 26 scored by @entity119 – while the @entity126 failed to progress from @entity14 ; he will start only 11th on sunday with @entity119 six places further up the grid			0
@entity119 is now 3 - 1 up on his team - mate in qualifying , and has finished each of opening three races ahead of @entity121 , too			0
indeed , the surly @entity126 has spent just eight racing laps in front of @entity119 this term			0
the @entity122 team is built around @entity119 , and it 's evident that @entity121 is finding it difficult to muscle his way in			0
it appeared an odd decision to re-hire @entity121 after effectively sacking him in 2009 , and while it is the early days of his second career at @entity143 , foreseeing an equally disappointing end is n't such a far - fetched theory			0
getting the job done : @entity119 , who will start fifth , is winning the intra-team battle against @entity121 spinning while taking his eyes off the road , crashing in the pit - lane , and failing to get out of the garage for qualifying ; it 's about as close to a nightmare weekend as you can get for pastor @entity156			1
the @entity157 will start plum last in tomorrow 's race after suffering an oil leak on his @entity161			1
there was some joy for @entity156 however , whose five - place grid penalty for sending @entity166 into a jaw - dropping 360 degree flip in @entity109 effectively becoming irrelevant			0
bad day at the office : pastor @entity156 has endured a nightmare weekend - he crashed in the pits on friday			1

@entity3 says he spun after *wrong* information from steering wheel
@entity0 surpasses @entity64 's record with 34th career pole
@entity93 out - qualifies @entity67 for third time this season
pastor @entity156 will start tomorrow 's @entity1 from last
