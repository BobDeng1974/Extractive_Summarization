by @entity0 men with wide faces have been getting a bad reputation lately			1
scientists had previously suggested large faces were prone to being more aggressive , untrustworthy and deceitful			0
but now there may be good news for the likes of @entity9 and @entity10			2
researchers in the @entity12 claim people with wide faces are more likely to get a bonus compared with their thin - faced rivals			1
there may be good news for the likes of @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right )			2
researchers in the @entity12 claim people with wide faces are more likely to get a bonus compared with thin - faced rivals @entity20 faced workers earn £ 1,300 more than those with narrow faces when asking for a bonus , the study found			1
however , researchers said this comes with a compromise			0
wide faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations			1
and men who are more attractive are better collaborators compared to less attractive men , they said			1
previous research based on the ' facial width - to - height ratio ' found individuals behave more selfishly when interacting with men with wider faces			1
on average , fuller faced workers such as @entity39 on the left earn £ 1,300 more than those with narrow faces ( such as that of @entity44 on the right ) when asking for a bonus , the study found this research claims that while men with wider faces are more likely to lie and cheat , they tend to lead more financially successful firms			1
it is an established fact that someone with a long face is probably feeling a bit sorry for themselves - but scientists say people with wide faces are untrustworthy			1
research has shed new light on the motives of ' wide boys ' who are more likely to lie and cheat than their thinner faced contemporaries			2
but the study also showed that those with larger faces , such as former prime minister @entity65 and disgraced former @entity12 president @entity66 , were more cut - throat and therefore more likely to be successful , particularly in business or in politics			1
psychologists from @entity71 gave 150 men an exercise to complete where they had to roll virtual dice on a screen and then manually write down their score			0
they were told that the number they recorded would correspond to the number of tickets they received in a lottery			0
the researcher then left the room while they completed the task			0
but software secretly recorded the real total allowing the psychologists to compare it with what the respondent had entered			0
about 20 per cent - or one in five - of the men who took part cheated , all of whom had wide face			2
' we negotiate everyday whether we think about it or not , ' said @entity101 's professor @entity100			0
' it ’s not just the big things , like a car or a home			0
it ’s what time your kid is going to go to bed or what you or your spouse are going to have for dinner			0
' these studies show that being a man with a wider face can be both a blessing and a curse and awareness of this may be important for future business success			2
' the study by @entity101 ’s @entity123 ’s @entity122 set up four experiments to reach their conclusion			0
the first involved bonus negotiations while the second found men with wider faces selling a chemical plant negotiated a higher sale price than men with a more narrow face			1
when those same wide - faced men were in the buyer role they negotiated a lower price than the narrow - faced men			1
in the third negotiating scenario , in which a creative solution was needed to bridge a gap on a property deal wider - faced men were less successful in the negotiation			2
in the final scenario the more attractive men were more successful in the negotiation in the property deal			0
the study was published online in the journal ' @entity152			0

men with wider faces , such as @entity10 , are more likely to get a bonus
but wide faced people fare less well when it comes to business negotiations
men who are more attractive are also better collaborators , the study found
