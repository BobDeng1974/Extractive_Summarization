@entity0 continues to review the candidates for @entity2 's @entity4 award for 2014			0
here @entity5 looks at the autobiography of former @entity7 and @entity9 star @entity8 , who is one of the most high - profile sports stars to make public that he is gay			1
author : @entity8 and @entity12 publisher : @entity14 rating : 4.5/5 ‘ my suicide would be measured , civilised			1
i would gradually become incapable , and slip gently into the water ... so much for the fantasy fatality ... i could n’t follow it through			0
’ when an autobiography opens up with a chapter about one of the numerous times a @entity25 rugby icon tried to kill himself due to a burning secret he felt he could n’t reveal to society , you know that you are in for a hard - hitting read			1
yet somehow , despite learning of the struggles @entity8 has been through in his personal and professional life , you do not find yourself downhearted			1
instead , @entity31 is captivating , revealing and simply brilliant to read			1
it is also about so much more than a person ’s sexuality , because that is not the only thing which defines them			0
@entity8 has written his autobiography , giving insight into his rugby career and personal battles @entity8 racked up a breathtaking 40 tries in 100 caps for @entity7 ’s rugby union side , including more than 50 as captain			1
he represented the @entity9 in three tests , captaining them in two of those			0
he played for @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 during a stellar professional career before converting to rugby league and representing the @entity57 and his home nation of @entity7 on four occasions			1
he is a deep and fascinating person , one who gives a unique insight into what it is like to captain one of the world ’s finest sides			0
the dark moments of @entity8 ’s life reveal so much about a complicated character			1
he is not your archetypal sportsman who lives his very public persona – @entity8 admits in his book in fact that , until he came out in 2009 , he lived a dual life			1
publicly , @entity8 was ‘ @entity8 ’ – a man ’s man , who ‘ loved the craic			2
he drank to excess , picked fights in pubs , and played to the gallery by rampaging around town in a range of fancy - dress masks			0
’ but privately , he was holding back a secret , one he felt he could not reveal to the world			0
the @entity25 rugby captain was gay , but did not believe he could be accepted in the hyper - masculine world of professional sport as such			1
it was that secret which led @entity8 to try and drown himself in his swimming pool at his home in @entity53 , where he played between 2004 and 2007			2
it was that secret which compelled @entity8 to stand on a cliff edge in south @entity25 , to remove all his clothes and come within an inch of jumping to his death			2
however , when it comes to rugby , @entity8 gives a unique insight that only a man who has played in such high - profile games as he could			1
explaining that when he captained @entity7 he was ‘ nothing without the team , ’ he goes through his leadership style and reveals how to skipper a side to @entity110 glory			2
it is fascinating and something all rugby fans should endeavour to read			0
@entity31 is up there with the most honest books i have ever picked up			2
@entity8 regularly admits to self - loathing throughout his life ; to cheating on his wife while on trips to the gay scene in @entity122 to ‘ satisfy ’ his urges and keep his secret hidden ; to turning to drink to hide his inner - battle with himself ; and to being a ‘ dreadful ’ husband			1
what ’s more , this is not an account for which @entity8 wants pity – he is just being brutally honest			2
he knows the mistakes he has made , but he is also aware of the pressures and expectations put upon the captain of a rugby - mad nation			2
@entity8 and @entity136 lift the @entity138 trophy at the @entity139 in march 2005 @entity8 scores a try against @entity141 during the @entity9 tour of @entity143 in 2005 the @entity7 captain celebrations a victory over @entity146 at the @entity146 in 2005 admitting that the brutal reaction of @entity149 rugby league fans to his homosexuality in march 2010 was the ‘ manifestation of the worst nightmare imaginable ’ , @entity8 in some ways proves he was vindicated in keeping his sexuality secret			1
the world has moved on an awful lot since homosexuality was deemed unacceptable , but unfortunately there are still some out there who can not accept people for what they are			0
@entity8 consistently states that he is no ‘ hero ’ for ' coming out ' – but he is most certainly a trailblazer at the very least			1
the first few professional sportspeople to do so will always be the bravest individuals and will always face the most difficult task , and it is for that reason that @entity31 can be an inspiration to all homosexual athletes			2
the @entity170 has been to hell and back because of his previously hidden sexuality , but he reveals a sense of an inner peace now that his secret is so public			0
it was extremely difficult , excruciatingly painful and took him many years to find – yet @entity8 is now at one with himself			0
he knows who he is , and he is proud of that , something which comes across eloquently on every single page			0
this book is as inspiring as it is moving and depressing			0
a must read and , as brilliant as i imagine the other nominees must be , i would be gobsmacked if this did not pick up the @entity186 award			0
look out for reviews of the other books in the running for the award thoughout this week .			0
