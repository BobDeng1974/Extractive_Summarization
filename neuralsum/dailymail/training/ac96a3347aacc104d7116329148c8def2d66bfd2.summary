' he was just a very @entity18 - gifted kid , ' @entity6 told @entity19 of his son			1
' i think he slept with a smile on his face			0
' mr @entity6 expressed his anger at @entity9 , saying only he knows the truth of what happened on the track at the @entity28 on saturday night			1
they were at the race where he died but did not see him get hit ' the one person that knows what happened that night is possibly facing 10 years in prison			2
is he going to say what he done ? ' mr @entity6 said			1
he was at the @entity28 with his wife @entity42 when their son got into a crash on lap 14 of a 25 - lap @entity47 race			1
a video of the incident apparently shows @entity9 's car apparently making contact with @entity6 's car before the younger driver 's vehicle spins out and comes to a stop near a wall			1
@entity6 can then be seen getting out of his crashed car and walking towards other cars on the track before pointing a finger , apparently at @entity9			1
a car swerves to avoid him , but when @entity9 's car passes close to @entity6 , his right rear tire apparently hits him , and @entity6 was pulled beneath the car and thrown in the air			1
mr @entity6 said it was the first time his son had ever climbed out of his car during a race , and believes he reacted that way is because of ' who put him into the wall '			1
questions : mr @entity6 said that all the other drivers managed to see his son walking on the track on saturday night but for some reason , @entity10 star @entity9 ( pictured ) failed to see him proud : the devastated parents said they do not want their son to be remembered for his death ' @entity9 was the best damn driver by far on the track that night , ' he said			1
' why he had to go up as high as he did and hog my son , there 's no reason for it			0
' he said that all the other drivers on the track saw the young man walking - but @entity9 still hit him			1
@entity87 ' apparently , @entity9 was the only one driving out there who did n't see him , ' he said			2
but mr @entity6 did not see his son get hit because he was riding a four - wheeler over to where the car had crashed			1
as he headed over there , someone told him @entity6 had been hit			2
the couple watched for 45 minutes as emergency workers performed cpr and traveled with their son to the hospital			2
there , they received the call from their daughter			0
@entity3 will be remembered at a funeral service on thursday			0
@entity104 sheriff 's deputies , who have met twice with the @entity6 family , are still investigating the crash and are looking at another video of the incident			2
confrontation : @entity3 was hit after he was nudged off the course and walked on the track , pointing his finger angrily at @entity9			1
@entity9 's car then fatally hit him when it came around the track sheriff @entity114 has said that his initial findings have turned up nothing that would indicate criminal intent in the crash - but legal experts agree that does not mean @entity9 is in the clear			1
he could be charged with second - degree manslaughter under @entity123 law if prosecutors believe he ' recklessly caused the death of another person , ' with negligent homicide another possibility , criminal law professor @entity129 of the @entity130 told the @entity1			0
' the question over whether someone was reckless is a factual one , and one a prosecutor might let a jury decide , ' said @entity129 , who also posts at the @entity137 blog			0
@entity9 would not expect to be charged for the car - on - car bump that sent @entity6 spinning into the wall			1
but if , for example , he were to tell police he saw @entity32 on the track and tried to shower him with dirt or send him a message , a first - degree manslaughter charge could be a possibility , @entity129 said			0
in a 1949 case that @entity129 uses in his class , midget car racer @entity148 was found guilty of manslaughter after he tried to squeeze a four foot - wide vehicle through a two - foot opening at 40 mph , crashing into another car and sending it into the one driven by @entity157			0
@entity157 's car flipped three times and he was killed			0
missed : a makeshift memorial can be seen for @entity161 at @entity162 in @entity123 , where he was fatally hit on august 9			0
@entity3 will be remembered at a funeral on thursday @entity148 's conviction was upheld on appeal by the @entity166			0
noting that a violent or aggressive act on a football field or in a boxing ring is not necessarily a crime , justice @entity167 wrote : ' in the present case physical contact was not an essential part of the racing of automobiles			0
' @entity114 would not say how @entity9 described the accident , but he said he has reviewed two videos and spoken to @entity178			0
there is no video or audio from @entity9 's vehicle			0
' the worst thing that could happen for @entity9 is if his story does n't seem to match other evidence , ' @entity129 said			2
' because then it might call into question his own story			0
' after the investigation is completed , @entity114 said , the evidence will be turned over to the district attorney			0
even if he is cleared by prosecutors , though , @entity9 could face a civil suit .			2
