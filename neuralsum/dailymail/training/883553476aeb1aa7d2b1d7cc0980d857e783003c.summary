by @entity0 published : 17:05 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 17:05 est , 17 may 2013 @entity1 fell for a smooth - talking serial conman who went on to swindle her out of 200,000 pounds despite spending a year in jail for duping four women out of their savings , @entity3 had not changed his ways			1
within months of his release he was trawling bars and nightclubs for more lonely , vulnerable women to fleece			1
so when he met @entity1 , a divorcee who was about to receive a £ 245,000 settlement for her broken marriage , she made the perfect target			1
pretending to be a successful businessman , the jobless gambling addict wormed his way into mrs @entity1 ’s affections , and soon the couple were living together			1
thinking of him as her ‘ rock ’ , she told @entity3 all about her lucrative divorce settlement following the sale of the six - bedroom marital home she used to share with her company director ex-husband			1
@entity3 , 45 , persuaded her to let him set up an online bank account for her , and help handle her bills			0
in reality , the only person he helped was himself – to her cash			0
he swindled her out of £ 200,000 in two months , including £ 70,000 in one particularly lucrative week , blowing much of it in betting shops			1
mrs @entity1 , 50 , a housewife throughout her marriage who had limited computer skills , said : ‘ i wish i had looked him up on the internet before i started a relationship with him , but it ’s not something you think to do straight away			1
‘ i was n’t that good on a computer at the start , i could just about write emails – nowadays i have much more knowledge			1
‘ even when he set up my online banking i was reluctant because i did n’t know how to use it , which is why he organised the bills and had access to my accounts			1
’ she could have discovered the fraudster ’s past online in seconds , as his previous crimes had been widely reported			0
a web search would have shown that @entity3 was sentenced to three years in march 2008 for a string of similar scams dating back six years , including conning three women out of tens of thousands of pounds – and that he had even tricked a fourth woman by pretending to be a barrister while awaiting trial			2
he was released after 12 months			0
mother of two mrs @entity1 only discovered the fraud when she tried to buy a new home and was told by her bank that she had no money left			1
every morning she had watched as @entity3 walked out the door in a smart suit , thinking he was heading to business meetings			0
in fact , he had spent his days blowing her money in betting shops			0
days after they split up , @entity3 ( pictured ) emailed her a photo of himself stood against a new car , apparently bought with her money the conman was jailed again for two years this week at @entity82			0
yesterday mrs @entity1 , of @entity83 , @entity84 , branded him ‘ completely heartless and disgusting with no conscience ’			1
‘ you read about this sort of thing happening to other people and your first reaction is to think “ what a stupid person ” , and “ what a fool to believe all that ” , ’ she said			2
‘ he was a calculating , professional conman and i do n’t believe i had a chance			2
he has fooled people cleverer than me and lived in a fantasy life full of compulsive lies			0
’ mrs @entity1 met @entity3 in a bar , where they bonded over their appreciation of soul music			1
she had separated from her husband @entity105 amicably after 20 years in 2010			0
she moved out of the former marital home in june 2011 , and shortly afterwards @entity3 moved in with her			0
‘ he would leave the house suited and booted , telling me he was interviewing or having meetings			2
i had no reason to disbelieve him , ’ she said			0
‘ i had no idea about the gambling			2
in fact , when i wanted to put a bet on the @entity113 he told me he had never put a bet on anything			0
’ when she confronted him after discovering her account had been drained , @entity3 kept lying , claiming he used the money to pay for work - related bills – and that he would reimburse her with a loan			0
when that never materialised , she contacted police			0
@entity3 had spent @entity1 's money in betting shops ( stock picture ) when she believed him to be at work @entity3 was charged with six counts of fraud			1
earlier this month he admitted one count relating to unauthorised bank transfers			0
the others , which involved credit cards , were left on file			0
@entity3 , of @entity136 , @entity84 , admitted swindling mrs @entity1 out of £ 150,000 , but he is thought to have benefited from more than £ 200,000 including loans she gave him that were never repaid			1
mrs @entity1 , who has had to take a job as a sales manager , said : ‘ some days i have no idea how i managed to stand up , let alone work full time and care for my family			1
‘ i loved and trusted this man and to think i allowed him to not only be in my life , but my daughters ’ lives too , it makes me feel sick			2
‘ i am determined to make sure that no other woman falls into his trap			2
he has no right to destroy people ’s lives and he has to be stopped once and for all			0
‘ i found the strength to come forward with the support of my family and friends and i hope other people who may have been affected by him will go to the police			2
’ mrs @entity1 has complained to her bank over the irregular transactions , and the matter has since been referred to the financial ombudsman .			1

@entity1 was a divorcee who was about to receive £ 245,000
she fell for the charms of @entity169 who had been previously *convicted*
he had conned four other women out of their savings
she said : ‘ i wish i had looked him up on the internet before i started a relationship with him '
