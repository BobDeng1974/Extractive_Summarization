by @entity0 published : 06:19 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 06:46 est , 26 april 2013 research into a new hiv vaccine has been halted after experts found it to be of no use			1
the @entity7 government stopped trials of the experimental hiv vaccine after an independent review found it did not prevent @entity9 infection or reduce the amount of @entity9 in the blood			1
the research , started in 2009 , it is just the latest in a series of failed attempts to develop a vaccine for the virus			1
the study , called @entity21 , had enrolled 2,504 volunteers in 19 @entity7 cities			1
scientists are trying to develop a vaccine for the hiv virus but progress is slow ‘ this trial has provided a clear , swift answer about a specific vaccine strategy , ' @entity28 , executive director of the nonprofit group @entity29 , told @entity33			2
it 's not the answer we hoped for , but the search does n't end here			0
‘ researchers need to unpack the data from this trial to understand more about why this strategy did n't prevent infection			1
’ the review board has recommended that no further vaccinations be given			0
the @entity44 , which sponsored the study , said it would continue to follow study participants to further evaluate the trial data			0
the @entity21 trial tested a two - part vaccine strategy designed to first prime the immune system and then provide a vaccine ' boost '			2
the vaccine itself was based on a common cold virus that was used to sneak @entity9 genes into the body and grab the attention of the immune system			0
so far , there are no vaccines approved to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus or @entity9 , the virus that causes @entity64			1
several @entity9 trials are still underway or in planning stages , including a follow - up to a @entity69 trial which in 2009 showed a vaccine combination cut hiv infections by 31.2 percent			0
killer : the hiv virus attacks the body 's immune system although the finding was not strong enough to approve the vaccine , it offered the first glimpse that a vaccine could work			0
both of these vaccines - the one in the @entity69 study and the @entity21 study - are largely designed to train immune system cells known as t - cells to recognize and kill cells already infected with @entity9			1
researchers are studying other approaches , including vaccines that activate powerful antibodies to prevent @entity9 from infecting cells in the first place			0
@entity93 , a vaccine advocate for @entity29 who participated in the @entity21 study , said he remains hopeful in the search for a vaccine			2
' these results do not change the fundamental view that an aids vaccine remains critical to any long - term strategy to end the @entity64 epidemic , ' he said .			0

study called @entity21 was found not to prevent infection or reduce levels of virus in blood
research is just one of many failed attempts to develop a vaccination for *disease*
