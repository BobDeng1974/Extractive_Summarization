by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 05:55 est , 10 july 2013 grief : @entity10 and @entity11 after the inquest into the death of their son @entity6 outside the @entity8 in @entity9 where he was a pupil the father of a public schoolboy has criticised his school for announcing his death to other parents before he had been told			1
@entity17 , 13 , died after being knocked down by a 4x4 outside his school as he crossed a road to play in a rugby match			1
his father , @entity20 , said @entity8 , near @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity9 , sent out an email to parents after @entity6 had been and injured			1
then around half an hour later another email without his knowledge was sent to parents announcing @entity6 ’s death - while mr @entity17 was still unaware on a train from @entity30 , he said			1
as he was on the train , mr @entity17 said he started receiving messages of condolence via text from people who had received the school ’s email			1
@entity6 ’s mother , @entity11 , had already arrived at the hospital but she was advised not to break the news of her death to her husband until he was there too			1
following an inquest into his death today , mr @entity17 condemned the school , saying it had acted ' appallingly ' and that its actions had caused ' incredible pain '			1
they are suing the school , where @entity6 excelled at cricket , rugby and football , after claiming he should have been supervised by an adult across the road			1
the roman catholic school , which also posted a statement on its website about @entity6 ’s death , has previously said it published the information in ' good faith ' but its initial belief that both his parents had been told about the tragedy turned out to be ' incorrect '			1
today , following the two - day inquest at @entity67 , @entity9 assistant deputy coroner @entity65 recorded a verdict of accidental death			0
tragedy : @entity71 died as he crossed a road outside his school on the way to play rugby no mention was made by her in her closing remarks about the way in which the school disclosed @entity6 ’s death before his father had been told			1
ms @entity65 had said the inquest ’s focus was on three matters - the events of the day of the crash , the school ’s road crossing policy and what changes have been made since @entity6 ’s death			1
the coroner ruled out submissions by the family ’s solicitor that @entity6 died as a result of neglect but she did say school rules had not been ' adhered to '			1
outside the hearing , mr @entity17 , from @entity97 , @entity98 , said : ' i think the school behaved inappropriately			1
they decided to announce to the school parents by email that @entity6 had died			1
' distraught : @entity20 ( pictured with @entity6 ) started receiving messages of condolence before he had been informed of his son 's death ' it caused incredible pain			1
i think if a child dies in the school ’s custody there should be reconciliation and we feel the school behaved appallingly to @entity11 and me in that reconciliation			2
he added : ' when i was collected by the police at 4.30pm , i was getting text messages to say that @entity6 had died and clearly i had no knowledge of whether this was true or incorrect			0
' it was only at 5.30pm when i got to the hospital to be met by my wife that my worst fears were confirmed			0
' the inquest heard that @entity6 was crossing a road with a friend as they headed to play in a school rugby match when he was hit by a @entity135			1
the driver of the 4x4 , @entity138 , said he was travelling at around 40mph in a 60mph zone with his grand - daughter at the time of the incident			0
mr @entity138 told the inquest : ' i got to a short distance of the crossing and through the side window i just saw someone on the side of the road			1
i only saw one ( person )			0
the teenager died after being knocked down by a 4x4 outside @entity8 , near @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity9 , as he crossed a road to play in a rugby match ' and then the young lad just arrived in front of the @entity135			2
just as the boy hit the @entity135 i did an emergency stop			0
i had little time to react			0
' when i stopped , i got out of the @entity135 and looked to see the boy , and got straight on to the mobile phone			0
' mr @entity138 will not face criminal charges over the crash , which happened on a road he said he travelled on up to 15 times a day , the inquest heard			2
@entity6 , a sporty teenager who played golf at county level , was pronounced dead from multiple injuries at @entity169 in @entity170 , @entity171 , on november 30 2011			2
@entity6 , a sporty teenager who played golf at county level , was pronounced dead from multiple injuries at @entity169 the boy who was with @entity6 when he was struck described in a statement to police how he ' froze ' and how the crash had left him in ' disbelief '			2
moments before the crash , he explained how he mentioned to @entity178 that his sock was down			0
he told police : ' i was looking at my shoe and then after two seconds , i looked up at @entity182			0
he was on the pavement			0
' i saw him running and stop , and ( @entity182 ) said , " @entity186 " , and then the whole thing happened			0
' he added : ' i did n’t see the car before it all happened			0
' the boy said he had crossed the road before without adult supervision and that he had not been made to wait for a teacher to help him across			2
@entity192 , a teacher at @entity8 who had overall responsibility for the games department , faced questions about the school ’s policy on safe road crossing for pupils			1
under the school ’s rules , he said students in years 7 and 8 had to have adult supervision when crossing the road			1
@entity6 was in year 8			0
questioned by the @entity206 ’ solicitor , mr @entity192 said the policies did not state what should happen if a student is late			0
he added : ' i would ’ve expected ( pupils ) to go to games staff or a member of the house			0
' mr @entity192 said the policy was communicated to pupils via the bursar who would give them a health and safety talk at the start of the year			0
he added that staff would be expected to read policies			0
@entity8 headmaster @entity222 agreed that the road where @entity6 was killed , @entity224 , was regarded as one of the top 10 risks at the school			1
he told the inquest the school insisted at the time on pupils from years 7 and 8 being accompanied across the road by an adult , with enforcement of the policy delegated to the head of department			1
however , the inquest heard statements from some pupils who were unaware of the school 's policy that they should be aided by an adult to cross the road			1
tribute : a message appeared on the website announcing the 13 - year - olds death mr @entity222 said pupils were informed of the policy by the bursar who acts on health and safety issues , and they were reminded half - termly by housemasters and in assemblies			2
mr @entity222 said : ' i believe that the policies we had at the time were adequate for what we had to do			0
' they were reviewed annually , there were no reports coming through at any level to suggest that the policies were inadequate and not being followed appropriately			0
' he said that pupils running late for games , as @entity6 was , should turn back to seek adult help if they find no one at the road to assist them			2
since his death , no pupils are allowed to cross the road without adult help and the school has put in place a chaperone			1
the school has pressed the local authority for a reduction in speed on the road from 60mph to 40mph , and there is lobbying for a further cut to 30mph , he added			1
upset : @entity6 's mother @entity11 ( pictured ) and his father are suing the school for failure in its duty of care to their son planning permission has been granted for a footbridge which should be built by september , enabling pupils and staff to cross to the field without using the road			1
in the meantime , a temporary road crossing has been installed which will be removed once the footbridge has been built , the inquest was told			1
@entity304 , of @entity305 , said there were four recorded crashes on @entity224 in 10 years but none involved pedestrians			0
recording her verdict , ms @entity65 said : ' i do n't find in this case there is sufficient evidence to find a gross failure of basic case to someone in obvious need where the school did have a policy and did take steps even though in some respects the accommodation of that policy was n't successful			2
' she said the speed of the driver was ' appropriate ' and the driver braked before impact			0
ms @entity65 added : ' it appears to me , for whatever reason , @entity6 was inattentive when he crossed the road			2
there was an ability to see an oncoming vehicle			0
' outside the hearing , mrs @entity17 said : ' we feel very strongly that we put a huge amount of trust in the school and unfortunately those expectations were not met			2
' we are going to continue our civil litigation case with the school in conjunction with our solicitors			2
' @entity8 later apologised for its failure to ensure pupils from years 7 and 8 were accompanied across the road by an adult			2
in a statement following the inquest , it said : ' the school respects and accepts the coroner 's verdict of accident			0
' her findings reflect the school 's admission that the rule that @entity361 and 8 pupils should be escorted across the @entity224 was not enforced or adhered to			0
' for this failure the school apologises			0
in the aftermath of the tragic accident which befell @entity6 , the school has secured with the council a reduction in the speed limit along the road			1
' furthermore , a bridge is under construction to ensure that the grief suffered by @entity375 and mrs @entity17 should not be endured by any other parents			0
mr and mrs @entity17 continue to be in the prayers of the whole school			0

@entity71 was just 13 when he was killed crossing the road
his school sent out an email to parents with the *sad* news
but father @entity20 found out his son was dead from texts
