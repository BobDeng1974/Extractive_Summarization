the curry , which is filled with 20 @entity16 - the second hottest on the planet - is so dangerous to make it has to be prepared by chefs wearing goggles and a face mask			1
but dr @entity8 became the first out of 300 people to successfully tackle the curry at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , on thursday evening - and said completing the challenge was harder than when he climbed @entity30 last year			1
despite walking out of the restaurant half - way through after suffering hallucinations , he returned a short time later when his wife found him wandering along the high street			2
and fighting back tears for another hour , dr @entity8 finally managed to swallow the last mouthful to defeat the dish			1
' i like hot curries and have at least one a week , but this was off the scale , ' he said			0
' it took me about an hour to eat it and i had to stop half way through and go out for a walk and some fresh air			2

' i trained as a doctor in @entity90 and later as a radiologist in @entity92 , so as a student i got used to eating curries as they were cheap , ' he said			2
' this curry got hotter and hotter as i went on and it was a struggle to finish , but i was determined to succeed			2
' the owner offered me a glass of milk to help with the hotness , but i decided to stick with beer and i think that helped			0
' i had to take a short break and go for a walk as i felt really sweaty and the owner said i was hallucinating , but i think it was just the endorphins from all the chillis			0
' his daughter @entity108 , 23 , said they all tried the curry but could only manage half a teaspoon			0
' i knew it was hot when dad admitted it was rather hot as he never does that , ' she said			0
' but he seemed to manage it without many problems			0
we were all clutching our stomachs after just half a teaspoon , it blew my head off			0
' @entity75 , managing director and executive chef at the restaurant said : ' it took mr @entity8 just over an hour to eat @entity10 - but that included a 10 minute walk down @entity128 when he started hallucinating			1
' more than 300 people have tackled @entity10 before - including about 10 women - but no one has ever been able to finish one			1
' most manage about seven mouthfuls before they give up			0
' we 've had people sweating , crying , shaking and vomiting			1
' we even had to ring an ambulance once			0
' @entity137 : dr @entity8 took on the challenge at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 fiery dish : the dish contained 20 @entity142 chillies , which is the second hottest chilli in the world at over six million @entity145 after the @entity146 mr @entity75 said dr @entity8 , who is a regular curry eater from @entity148 , excelled at the culinary challenge			1
