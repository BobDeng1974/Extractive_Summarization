banking giants must be broken up to drive down the cost of mortgages and loans for customers , a leading think tank said today			1
separating high street banking from high - risk investment arms would increase competition and make it easier for people to get a better deal , the @entity12			1
the do n't bank on it report warned customers are paying huge fees and charges because a handful of big name banks dominate and impose charges on customers to maximise pay and bonuses			1
call for change : the report by the @entity12 argued competition in banking should be increased by making it easier for new players to enter the market global banks have become too ‘ detached ’ , focussing on maximising salaries and bonuses even if it meant ripping off customers , the report said			1
in future banking bosses could be personally fined if things go wrong			2
senior management should suffer the internal equivalent of bankruptcy ’ , which would mean they lose their jobs and any deferred bonuses and pension rights			0
ministers are also accused of being ‘ too timid ’ in taking on the @entity44 to split retail and investment banking			1
it is argued that if the risky investment banking was hived off , no bank would be ‘ too big to fail ’ and the taxpayer would not be forced to step in to rescue an institution which got into trouble			1
competition in banking should be increased by making it easier for new players to enter the market , the report argued			0
‘ given the culture of the financial sector is unlikely to change without external influence , retail and investment banking activities should be split into separate institutions			1
’ retail banks would offer a ‘ relatively simple process ’ with policymakers would be to ‘ facilitate a high degree of competition ’ to get the best deal for customers , both savers and those looking for a loan			2
‘ investment banking would be far more complex in nature and would require much stricter regulation designed to control risk - taking and minimise the risk of another financial crisis			1
this could include making senior managers and directors financially responsible when things go wrong			0
’ the @entity12 warned that ‘ detachment from customers ’ was to blame for several banking scandals			2
‘ multiple evidence of mis - selling , the libor scandal and the anecdotal evidence that large investment banks such as @entity86 exist primarily to maximise the salaries , bonuses and share options of their staff rather than to deliver the best possible service to their customers are all signs that the culture of finance has changed for the worse			1
’ @entity99 , chief economist at @entity12 , said : ‘ the government is making some progress on tackling the implicit subsidies the rest of the economy provides for the financial sector and on reducing future liabilities for @entity108 taxpayers in the event of a financial crisis			2
‘ it has also taken steps to better protect stakeholders , such as depositors , borrowers , investors and shareholders			0
but more action is needed in both areas			0
’ the report also suggested that policymakers might have to look at putting greater curbs on mortgage lending to lessen the chances of any return to potentially risky lending			0
this could involve setting maximum loan - to - value and loan - to - income ratios on mortgages , the left - of - centre think - tank said			0
the report said the @entity133 should be particularly concerned about any institution that records a sharp increase in its share of the mortgage market			0
last month , the @entity138 , set up in the wake of the libor - rigging scandal , said that plans included in the @entity143 ‘ fall well short of what is required ’			0
the commission 's report warned the ring - fence to separate risky operations from savers ' deposits needed ‘ electrification ’ .			0

@entity12 says banking giants became too detached from customers and took risks to maximise pay and bonuses
ministers accused of being ' too timid ' in *reforming* the @entity44
separating retail and high - risk investment banking would mean no bank is too big to fail or need a taxpayer bail - out
