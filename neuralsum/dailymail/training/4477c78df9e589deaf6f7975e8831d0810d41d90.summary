by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 09:41 est , 4 march 2013 @entity2 president @entity1 has launched an astonishing attack on @entity4 , accusing the ' arsonist ' government of being ' naive , confused and unrealistic ' in its approach to the ongoing conflict in his country			1
he went on to warn of ' grave ' consequences if the @entity13 armed its rebels			1
@entity1 said that @entity4 has been unconstructive in its attempts to militarise the rebels in an interview with the @entity19 he said @entity4 was sacrificing peace talks to push for an end to an @entity23 arms embargo , which would allow rebels to be armed			1
warning this would accelerate the road to war , he rejected the possibility of help from @entity4 to end the conflict , saying : ' we do not expect an arsonist to be a firefighter			1
he attacked the ' arsonist ' @entity4 government and issued a dire warning against arming rebels he added : ' how can we expect to ask @entity4 to play a role when it is determined to militarise the problem ? ' how can you ask them to play a role in making the situation better , more stable ? ' how can we expect them to make the violence less while they want to send military supply to the terrorists and do n't try to ease the dialogue between the @entity2 ( s )			1
' to be frank , @entity4 has played famously in our region ( an ) unconstructive role in different issues , for decades , some say for centuries			1
' this government is acting in a naïve , confused , and unrealistic manner			2
if they want to play a role they have to change this , they have to act in a more reasonable and responsible way			2
' @entity1 warned that if the @entity13 made moves that ended up with rebels being armed , there would grave consequences			1
' @entity2 lies at the fault line geographically , politically , socially and ideologically			0
so playing with this fault line will have serious repercussions all over the @entity73 ' any intervention will not make these things better			0
it will only make them worse			0
@entity78 and the @entity79 and others are going to pay the price sooner or later with the instability in this region			0
they do not foresee it			0
' foreign secretary @entity86 branded @entity1 ' delusional ' on the @entity87 after the @entity2 president spoke out against @entity4 's actions to push for an end to an @entity23 arms embargo today , foreign secretary @entity86 dismissed @entity1 's criticism of @entity4 as ' delusional ' and said @entity4 could not afford just to ' sit on the sidelines ' and watch the slaughter continue in @entity2			1
speaking on @entity95 's the @entity87 , @entity86 refused to rule out the prospect that @entity4 could arm the @entity2 rebels , despite @entity1 's warning			1
' the longer this goes on the greater the danger that extremism takes hold , the greater the danger of destabilising neighbouring countries , and the greater the extreme humanitarian distress involved			0
so we can not just sit on the sidelines and watch this			0
' we will be doing more and we will have to steadily do more if there is no diplomatic or political breakthrough			0
' the situation in @entity2 now is too dangerous to the peace and security of that entire region and thereby to the world to ignore it			0
' @entity86 , who is set to announce further non-lethal assistance to the rebels later this week , said that the @entity4 would continue to step up support for the opposition as long as there was no diplomatic or political breakthrough in the two - year long conflict			1
' i do n't rule anything out for the future , ' he said			0
' if this is going to go on for months or years and more tens of thousands of people are going to die and countries like @entity130 and @entity131 and @entity132 are going to be destabilised it is not something we can ignore			0
' these are the reasons why we ca n't just sit it out in @entity2			0
' members of the @entity138 inspect the wreckage of a helicopter , belonging to forces loyal to @entity2 president @entity1 , near @entity143 military airport members of the @entity146 battalion head to the front line in their conflict with forces loyal to the @entity2 president , in @entity152 's @entity151 district the conflict in @entity2 has killed an estimated 70,000 people since it started two years ago , while thousands of refugees have fled the country			1

' the @entity166 denied any offers of peace talks from @entity1 's government			1
the @entity4 has said that they will not provide rebels with arms despite supporting the opposition			1
but , foreign secretary @entity86 has not ruled out possible intervention in the future and is expected to detail an aid programme in parliament next week			2

' this comes as newly appointed @entity79 secretary of state @entity185 spoke on his first overseas tour in the role			0
he said : ' the opposition needs more help			0
we think it 's very important that more of our assistance gets to areas that have been liberated from the regime			2
