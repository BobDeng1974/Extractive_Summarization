@entity0 begins @entity2 defence against @entity3 @entity4 criticised @entity0 's appointment of @entity6 @entity0 will play first on @entity7 , at 1pm by @entity8 follow @ @ @entity9 @entity0 was forced to defend the decision to appoint @entity6 as his coach after negative comments from fellow @entity13 @entity2 champion @entity4			1
on the eve of beginning his title defence , @entity0 extolled the virtues of @entity18 ’s replacement , dismissing @entity4 ’s observations that he was ‘ messing with everyone ’ in making the appointment and that @entity6 was ‘ mentally fragile ’			1
asked if he was disappointed with another @entity13 tennis icon offering such criticism he replied : ‘ no , she ’s done it a few times before with me			2
it does n’t surprise me			2
’ no problem : @entity27 who hit the @entity29 practice courts on sunday , has defended his appointment of @entity6 hitting out : @entity2 legend @entity4 has been critical of @entity0 's decision to hire @entity6 @entity4 has expressed disapproval of @entity0 ’s on - court demeanour in the past			1
as for her opinion of @entity6 , she was probably expressing a view that others share but have been afraid to voice			1
the bottom line is that only @entity0 can judge if the @entity40 former world no 1 is the right person to work with him , and he emphasised that the initial phase of their relationship had gone well			1
‘ she struggled with nerves and conquered them later in her career , ’ he said			0
‘ someone like that can help more than someone who has n’t had those issues			0
you can talk about her accomplishments — she was no 1 in the world , she won multiple @entity56 , she had a creative game style			0
she ’s very easy to communicate with and she ’s firm			0
those are the reasons i wanted to give it a shot			0
’ happy days : @entity13 no 1 @entity0 was looking in relaxed spirits ahead of his @entity2 title defence up and away : @entity0 puts in some practice on his serve during his session on sunday keeping up appearances : @entity0 impressed with some keepy uppies during his practice session on the ball : @entity6 looks on as @entity0 returns during his practice session @entity0 said he did not know how he would feel stepping on court to face @entity73 ’s world no 104 @entity3 as he tries to avoid the fate of @entity75 , who in 2003 was the last men ’s defending champion to go out in the first round			1
‘ i have n’t spoken to @entity75 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the only person i ’ve spoken to about it is @entity6 , but i ’m aware that when i walk on court there ’s going to be pressure			1
that ’s why when i woke up there were butterflies , but that ’s a good thing			0
’ the traditional champion ’s sunday press conference was not a particularly straight - forward affair , and @entity0 studiously avoided being drawn by the now - customary attempt to goad him into saying something controversial about the @entity93 football team			1
such associated pressures aside , it is potentially a very awkward match as @entity3 is better than his ranking suggests			2
he has a decent game for grass and can lift his game against better @entity101 23 - year - old @entity73 was in confident mood as he contemplated inflicting more misery on our sporting nation			0
high hopes : @entity73 's @entity3 is hoping to provide an early upset when he takes on @entity108 on @entity7 ‘ i saw @entity93 is out of the @entity109 , i saw that @entity93 lost to @entity110 at rugby — so maybe in tennis it will be the same , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s the first time i ’ve played on @entity7 and it will be an honour to open the tournament			2
i played against @entity115 at @entity116 last year and played @entity117 there			0
i ’ve played @entity119 at the @entity120			0
‘ usually , i use the pressure and the emotion to play a good match and hope it will be the same against @entity0			1
’ @entity3 also sees an omen in what was achieved 12 months ago by fellow @entity128 resident @entity127 , who beat @entity129 in the first round			2
all begins again : @entity0 will be bedding to successfully defend the @entity2 title he memorably won last year against @entity115 ‘ he had that small chance and he took it			1
maybe i can do the same this year against @entity0 , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ @entity133 and @entity127 speak a lot although we have n’t spoken about my draw yet			0
we ’ll do that tonight			0
‘ what he did gives me encouragement			0
if he can do it then why ca n’t i ? if i have a small opportunity and @entity0 is a little bit tight you never know			2
i have nothing to lose			0
i have been at 42 in the world ; my goal is to get back in the top 50 this year			0
’ the women ’s champion , @entity145 , was also back at @entity2 — a year after @entity6 helped coach her to the title			1
‘ everyone brings a little one or two per cent to the table , ’ said @entity145			0
‘ @entity6 gave me the extra confidence boost that i really needed			2
’ @entity145 , who admitted that a legacy of her tennis career is that she now struggles to lift her right arm due to shoulder damage , explained : ‘ sometimes just knowing i could win was what i was lacking			0
@entity6 makes you feel very comfortable in a difficult situation			2
’ if @entity0 gets off to a slow start against @entity3 , that is exactly the place where he may find himself .			1
