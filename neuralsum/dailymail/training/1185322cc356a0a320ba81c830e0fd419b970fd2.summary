lager tops and @entity1 brought @entity2 back to reality even before the departing tv trucks signalled the end of another @entity7 fairytale at @entity8 on saturday night			2
captain @entity9 might have hoped for a bigger celebration after netting the two first - half goals which put the @entity13 side on the brink of round four before a quick - fire second - half response from @entity17 gave the visitors a 3 - 2 win			1
instead , just hours after starring on @entity20 , @entity9 was back at his job as a bar man at the @entity24 's pub in @entity25 on sunday morning , while @entity2 boss @entity26 was already planning for tuesday 's looming league trip to @entity1			1
@entity9 salutes the @entity2 fans after he got the side on their way to a giant killing on saturday @entity32 celebrates as @entity2 lost their two - goal cushion and @entity34 went 3 - 2 up in the @entity7 for lifelong @entity37 the inevitable disappointment of coming so close to a famous victory was quickly eased by his continuing focus on a job which he reluctantly accepted two years ago when the club were in dire straits			1
@entity26 said : ' we 've got @entity1 on tuesday night , but if we show the same resilience and character that we showed here today then we will be okay			2
' hopefully there will be a big crowd down there to support us again because we proved today just how much this team has got to give and the future is bright			0
@entity9 applauds fans after @entity51 were knocked out of the @entity7 despite their courageous effort @entity2 players are gutted after letting their two - goal lead slip in the @entity7 to eventually fall against @entity34 ' i 'm very proud of what we have achieved and the fact we scored two goals and dominated against a championship side is a huge compliment to us			1
we have now got to get back to the league and hope to come again next year			0
' @entity9 sent @entity8 wild with two well - taken finishes towards the end of the first half , which stirred memories of @entity2 's most famous @entity7 run in 1978 when - watched by @entity26 - they eventually lost a fifth - round replay to @entity69			1
but @entity71 - born @entity70 narrowed the deficit before two quick goals from @entity32 ensured @entity75 's @entity17 side wriggled out of another potential giant - killing			0
@entity2 manager @entity26 ( right ) was proud of his team 's performance despite losing 3 - 2 to @entity34 @entity79 scores his side 's first in the 35th minute to take a surprise lead against @entity34 @entity9 might have found his face plastered across sunday morning 's newspapers , but he was opening up at the @entity24 's having failed to convince his bosses that he deserved a day off following his @entity7 exploits			1
' it 's back to reality on sunday morning then away to @entity1 on tuesday , ' said @entity9			2
' we can be proud of what we have done as a team because we have been close to going out a few times , but we managed to get to this point			0
' at half - time we thought the shock was on and the aim was to keep it tight for 10 or 15 minutes , but it did n't work out			0
