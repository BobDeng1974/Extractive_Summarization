justice @entity0 pledged that an act of @entity2 would be used to ' clarify ' the existing legal right to use reasonable force against intruders householders were yesterday given licence to kill burglars with knives or pokers without fear of prosecution			1
justice secretary @entity13 suggested people would be judged to have acted within the law as long as they did not shoot intruders in the back as they were running away down the road			2
and he pledged that an act of @entity2 would be used to ‘ clarify ’ the existing legal right to use reasonable force against intruders			2
prime minister @entity20 last week promised that the government would ‘ put beyond doubt that homeowners and small shopkeepers who use reasonable force to defend themselves or their properties will not be prosecuted ’			2
the move follows public outrage at cases like that of @entity30 , the @entity32 farmer who shot dead a burglar , and @entity34 , who chased and beat a man who had held his family at knifepoint in their home			0
‘ if an old lady finds she has got an 18 - year - old burgling her house and she picks up a kitchen knife and sticks it in him , she has not committed a criminal offence and we will make that clear , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
‘ there is no doubt that you or i or anybody else is entitled to use reasonable force to defend ourselves and to protect ourselves or our homes or both			0
‘ we will make it quite clear you can hit the burglar with the poker if he is in the house and you have a perfect defence if you do so			0
’ mr @entity0 accepted that the defence of reasonable force already exists , but said : ‘ given that doubts are expressed , we are going to clarify that			1
‘ it is quite obvious that people are entitled to use whatever force is necessary to protect themselves and their homes			0
what they are not entitled to do is go running down the road chasing them or shooting them in the back when they are running away or to get their friends together and go and beat them up			0
‘ nobody should prosecute and nobody should ever convict anybody who takes these steps			0
’ an official spokesman for @entity20 said that the prime minister was ' very pleased ' with mr @entity0 's remarks , but @entity85 's justice spokesman @entity84 , right , said the @entity86 is in ' total shambles ' it is not clear whether a clause will be added to the government ’s @entity90 later in the year , or guidelines to police , prosecutors and courts will be strengthened			1
@entity20 ’s official spokesman said that the prime minister was ‘ very pleased ’ with mr @entity0 ’s remarks , which follow months of controversy over ‘ soft justice ’			1
but @entity85 ’s justice spokesman @entity84 accused the government of using ‘ spin and smokescreens of new laws in an attempt to distract from what is a @entity90 in total shambles ’ .			1

homeowners will be able to stab burglars without fear of prosecution , says mr @entity0
@entity85 say justice @entity90 is ' total shambles '
