within the next 30 years , the global population is set to increase by almost 3 billion up to 10 billion , and this rise is set to put a heavy burden on the healthcare industry			2
@entity5 @entity4 has predicted how he believes the world will cope with this extra demand , and which technologies are set to revolutionise medical treatment over the next 25 years			1
his forecasts include lighting that helps people recover from illness , virtual surgeries and wearables that detect cancer molecules			1
it also addressed how traditional job roles will evolve			1
the claims were made in @entity4 ’s ( pictutred ) @entity25 report @entity4 believes that technology is easing people away from ‘ mass medicine and treatment ’ into a more focused world of personalised medicine targeted at the individual , whether that be at home or in public hospitals			1
sensors will soon be able to relief pain , as well as detect cancer and other chemical inbalances in the body			1
material , food , water and energy waste will be reduced thanks to the so - called @entity50 , where everything is tracked , has sensors , and can communicate with each other			2
and within 25 years , mr @entity4 said jobs such as bankers , receptionists , call centre and warehouse operatives , will become redundant , with occupations such as ' cyborg engineers ' and ' crime predictors ' becoming common			1
‘ [ population figures ] sound bleak , but the reality is that technology has satisfied all our desires and needs and we ’ve never been in a better position than we are today , ’ said mr @entity4			1
‘ i ’ve looked at how human needs will impact on innovation , both now and in the future			0
’ mr @entity4 explained that all the complex technology of medical care is currently concentrated in hospitals , but it is gradually heading to the doctor ’s office			1
this will then head to bathroom cabinets , and in the future , people are increasingly going to be looking after their own health , using apps or virtual surgeries			1
the @entity85 website , for example , already offers virtual appointments with doctors , so patients can discuss conditions or problems , ask queries about an odd - looking rash or seek advice when they ca n’t get an appointment with their gp			2
dr @entity96 , a gp at the @entity97 in @entity98 , similarly uses @entity99 to consult with his patients and said they have ‘ revolutionised ’ his practice by cutting waiting times			0
according to the report , these advancements prove that technology is moving away from mass medical treatment into a more ‘ focused , personalised approach targeted at the individual			1
’ ‘ @entity110 at home , or in public hospitals many of the big expensive machines and laboratory facilities associated with hospitals are being miniaturised , simplified and migrated to the doctors ’ surgery and in turn will soon be seen in our bathroom cabinets , ’ continued the report			2
it also explained that a new range of sensors could one day promise everything from non-invasive scanning , to pheromone analysis capable of detecting the early onset of some cancers and other diseases			2
these in theory could be placed inside wearable devices such as a wristband			0
there are already a number of skin cancer apps available , too , that claim to be able to analyse and assess moles based on size and shape , including @entity140 and @entity141			2
elsewhere , @entity142 has been working with devices including @entity144 - a gadget that tracks an individual ’s pain , and monitors how it affects their life			0
the @entity25 report , by futurologist @entity4 looks at how medical trends will revolutionise healthcare by 2040 , his predictions include the rise of blue leds , virtual surgeries and appointments ( pictured ) , and sensors that detect cancer molecules while blue led light technology , which recently won the @entity162 , is used in products such as @entity164 , a wearable blue led light pain patch			1
@entity166 uses blue led lights to stimulate the body ’s natural production of nitric oxide			2
mr @entity4 also believes that in the near future , we will be able to @entity174 body parts this boosts circulation and increases the spread of oxygen and nutrients through the body to treat mild to moderate pains			1
the report went on to say that our homes and hospitals will look different in the future meaning our environments will help with recovery , in addition to medical technologies			1
lighting and sound , for example , is being experimented with to see how changes in hues , or noise , can help a patient heal or recover quicker			0
and these rooms can ‘ adapt ’ to respond to any changes			0
another such innovation in offices , hotels and public buildings is carpets that provide information and directions through the combination of led lighting and light - transmissive materials			0
lighting is also being used to boost food production			0
for example , an indoor farm in @entity210 uses 17,500 led lights spread over 18 cultivation racks , and these lights are used to mimic day and night			0
by monitoring the photosynthesis process carefully , the system grows lettuce two - and - a - half times faster than an outdoor farm			0
it also cuts waste product by 40 per cent and productivity per square foot is up 100-fold			0
purple lighting is used to mimic night , for example , while the white lights are adjusted slowly throughout the day to mimic a sun moving through the sky			0
and home lighting , including examples such as @entity230 and @entity231 , can now alert users if there is someone at the door , flash when a favourite team scores a goal , or change colour when a text message is received			0
@entity142 , for example , has been working with devices including @entity164 ( pictured )			0
it uses blue led lights , which recently won the @entity162 , to detect and relieve back pain			0
it uses the lights to stimulate the body ’s natural production of nitric oxide to boost circulation and the spread of oxygen around the body technology , and in particular smart lighting , is similarly being used to tackle food shortages and waste			0
for example , an indoor farm in @entity210 uses 17,500 led lights ( pictured ) to mimic day and night			0
by monitoring photosynthesis process carefully , the system grows lettuce two - and - a - half times faster than an outdoor farm they can also be remotely controlled to protect houses when homeowners are on holiday , for example			0
finally , the report looked at how jobs will change and evolve thanks to advances in technology			1
in the next 25 years , jobs such as bankers , receptionists , call centre and warehouse operatives , stock traders , train drivers , pilots and even journalists are expected to change , said mr @entity4 , as innovations develop to respond to human needs			1
and home lighting , including examples such as @entity230 ( pictured left ) and @entity231 ( pictured right ) , can now alert users if there is someone at the door , flash when a favourite team scores a goal , or change colour when a text message is received to make our lives easier finally , the report looked at how jobs will change and evolve thanks to advances in technology			1
in the next 25 years , mr @entity4 believes new jobs will be created , such as ‘ cyborg engineers ’ , ‘ crime predictors ’ - similar to those seen in film @entity306 ( @entity308 pictured ) - and ‘ information caretakers ’ mr @entity4 believes this will result in the creation of as yet unheard of jobs such as ‘ cyborg engineers ’ , ‘ crime predictors ’ – similar to those seen in film @entity306 - and ‘ information caretakers			1
’ @entity317 and @entity318 is often praised for increasing awareness , and boosting so - called ' citizen journalism ' , but mr @entity4 said that this also increases the spread of misinformation			2
he predicts that this will additionally lead to the rise of ' truth engines ' , that act like search engines but only show verified information			1
‘ when confronted by any new technology we should ask one vital question - what benefit will it bring to my life ? and the answer should guide our decision to embrace or avoid , ’ concluded mr @entity4 .			2

report was written by futurologist @entity4 and @entity26
it looks at medical trends that will revolutionise healthcare by 2040
blue leds , virtual surgeries and cancer sensors are among the innovations
@entity25 report also predicts how job roles will change
it claims ' cyborg engineers ' and ' truth engines ' will become common place
