after a 2 - 1 north @entity3 derby day victory against @entity4 on saturday , @entity1 fans are understandably starting to imagine their team finishing inside the @entity7 's top four			1
with a @entity7 clash against @entity10 to come on tuesday night , those same fans will be hoping that @entity1 can lay down a marker at @entity12 that suggests their team are serious contenders for fourth spot			2
however , @entity1 's next opponents have become somewhat of a bogey team , with @entity10 winning the last three @entity7 meetings and racking up an 12 - 0 aggregate scoreline			1
@entity18 ( left ) celebrates scoring @entity1 's second goal against @entity4 on saturday @entity10 have become a bogey team for @entity21 and beat them 3 - 0 at @entity22 last summer the biggest aggregate scorelines between current @entity7 teams after their last three meetings ... @entity26 vs @entity1 : 15 - 2 @entity10 vs @entity1 : 12 - 0 @entity27 vs @entity28 : 10 - 1 @entity4 vs @entity29 : 10 - 1 @entity27 vs @entity30 : 11 - 3 ( though 2 have been draws ) @entity31 vs @entity32 : 10 - 2 @entity34 ' side have enjoyed 5 - 0 , 4 - 0 , and 3 - 0 victories against the north @entity3 club in the last 16 months , but @entity1 boss @entity37 will no doubt believe his side have a chance to overturn those fortunes with his side and star striker @entity18 looking in brilliant form			1
@entity1 's first of three heavy beatings against the @entity46 came in december , 2013 and saw @entity47 begin the rout before goals from @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 completed a memorable day for @entity10 at @entity22			0
@entity10 , who were on the hunt for a first @entity7 title in over 20 years , moved to the top of the table after the 4 - 0 drubbing of @entity1 in march as an early own goal from @entity60 sparked another strike from the rampant @entity47 leaving @entity62 and @entity50 to do the rest			1
@entity64 celebrates his goal during @entity10 's victory at @entity22 in august , 2014 @entity34 ( left ) and @entity37 patrol the @entity22 touchline last season @entity1 then suffered their first loss under @entity37 with a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity22 as @entity52 , @entity64 and @entity71 compounded the home side 's misery in august , 2014			1
tuesday night , however , finds @entity1 in better form and a better mood coming off the back of @entity18 's double against @entity4 on saturday which put the @entity78 into fifth place in the @entity7 , just one point behind @entity81			0
@entity18 , who now has 22 goals to his name this season , is expected to lead the line once again as his side look to end their modern day hoodoo against the @entity90 outfit			0
although @entity1 wo n't be particularly proud of their recent record against @entity10 , it is not their worst in the current top flight			0
@entity47 smiles after putting @entity10 into a two - goal lead against @entity1 last year the @entity1 players stand dejected during @entity10 's 4 - 0 win at @entity12 in february , 2014 @entity37 's side also have a poor record against @entity7 champions @entity26 , with the former scoring just twice and conceding 15 goals in their last three meetings			1
other undesirable records includ @entity28 's 10 - 1 aggregate scoreline against @entity27 while @entity4 's recent 5 - 0 win against @entity29 also gives @entity106 's side a 10 - 1 deficit when adding together the last three games			2
after a run of fixtures that has seen @entity1 collect nine points from their last three @entity7 games and @entity10 winning three of their last four before being haulted by @entity114 , tuesday night 's game looks finely balanced			0
@entity1 will be hoping that by ending their recent hoodoo against @entity10 , they will also be announcing themselves as major contenders for a top four spot come the end of the season			0
@entity47 enjoys scoring in @entity10 's biggest win against @entity1 in recent years - a 5 - 0 victory in december , 2013			2

@entity1 have suffered heavy defeats in last three @entity7 clashes against @entity10
@entity10 have racked up 12 - 0 aggregate scored with 5 - 0 , 4 - 0 and 3 - 0 wins
spurs will be out to proved they are serious contenders for a top four spot
