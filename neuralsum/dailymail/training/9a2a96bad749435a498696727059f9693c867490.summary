a furious @entity0 blew his top over criticism of @entity4 ’s uninspiring performance in their 1 - 0 victory over @entity6 at @entity7			1
clearly irritated when asked to comment on the fact his side had only two shots on target , @entity0 snapped back : ‘ i ’m not going to judge it because someone is going to tell me , “ well , you only had two shots at goal ” because that is absolute f * * * * * * b * * * * * * * , i ’m sorry			1
’ the @entity4 coach was also prickly when pressed about the poor turnout at @entity7 and admitted it could take years before @entity4 get the best out of his @entity25			1
rant : @entity4 boss @entity0 has hit back at critics of his side following their win against @entity6 relief : @entity32 's penalty earned @entity4 a slender win at @entity7 spot on : @entity32 's below - par display didn ; t stop his burying the penalty kick the heat is on @entity0 as he prepares for monday ’s opening @entity39 qualifier against @entity40 in @entity41			1
he is coming under increasing pressure after fans turned their backs on an @entity4 team that returned from the @entity46 with one point from three games			2
a paltry 40,181 turned up on wednesday — the lowest crowd since the new stadium opened in 2007			0
on the @entity7 crowd , he said : ‘ now we have 40,000 to see us play against a much more difficult opponent than @entity54 ( who @entity4 played in may )			1
’ referring to the abject campaign in @entity57 , he added : ‘ i ca n’t put that right because i ca n’t turn back the clock , but what i can do is analyse what i have seen and judge that through my own eyes			0
’ bright spark : the performance of @entity66 against the @entity67 was one of few positives @entity4 ’s head coach pleaded for patience , saying it could take years before we see the best from @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity66			1
he said : ‘ i say , and will continue to say , that as long as they continue to give performances like they did against @entity6 , some of these are top , top players in the making			0
but you ca n’t play five games for @entity4 and be a regular in the @entity87 team for six or seven months and be @entity88			2
‘ you ca n’t come in , like @entity76 , after all the injuries at the moment , nail down a place in @entity94 ’s central defence and become @entity95			0
‘ you ca n’t be @entity75 , who has lost all that football through injury and then all of a sudden be @entity98			0
let ’s be fair about these things			0
that is all i am asking			0
more to come : @entity0 says fans must be patient with the likes of @entity75 talking tactics : @entity0 addresses his players during the friendly ‘ but also , allow me to be excited by what they can do and allow me also to stand in front of an assembled press conference when they play well and say , “ i think they did well ” even though there might be some cynicism out there			2
‘ i am talking to people here who have followed @entity4 for many years , and follow @entity118 football every week and there is no chance of pulling wool over the eyes of people who have seen top - class players and know what top - class players look like			1
’ @entity0 appeared ruffled when he walked into the media auditorium at @entity7 on wednesday and said : ‘ come on then , get on with it , i have n’t got a lot of time , ’ before a question had even been asked			1
one for the future : @entity0 will look to build his team around the likes of @entity135 he later claimed it was because his family and friends were waiting upstairs in a corporate lounge , but it emerged that he was furious about the quoting of negative statistics from @entity4 ’s performance			1
bizarrely , the @entity4 coach countered the question about @entity4 having had only two shots on targets by quoting another statistic : that @entity4 had more possession than their opponents			1
@entity0 has always insisted that he has no interest in statistical analysis or data , which is a massive departure from the new - school approach of modern managers			2
after regaining his composure , @entity4 ’s head coach later spoke in a separate briefing designed to be a more considered reaction to the performance of the team against @entity6			2
he added : ‘ the bottom line is this			0
before the @entity46 and the euphoria , we were getting 75,000 to watch us play @entity54 who , with respect , were nowhere near as difficult an opponent as we played tonight			0
‘ we ca n’t get rid of the baggage , we ca n’t change the fact we had a bad @entity46			0
if we had played badly against @entity6 , if a lot of players performed really badly , if the quality of our passing and movement was nothing like what i wanted to see , i would be the first to say so			0
’ @entity175 looks to spearhead @entity4 revival			2

@entity32 's goal earned @entity4 1 - 0 win at @entity7 on *thursday*
@entity4 registered just two shots on target over the entire 90 minutes
@entity0 aimed foul - mouthed blast at *reporters* who criticised his side
