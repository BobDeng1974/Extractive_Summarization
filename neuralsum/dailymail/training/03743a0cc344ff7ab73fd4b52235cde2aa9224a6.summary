she falls under both categories , ' he told @entity45			0
' my client has been the victim of bullying in the past and she is currently being bullied by the system			0

' in response to that @entity1 said : ' i really do n't care what sheriff @entity16 has to say			1
i do n't need publicity			2
this case is smaller than other cases i 've handled before			2
' ' what i plan on doing in this case is move away from shifting the blame and actually help people learn from this experience , ' he said			0

' we decided that we ca n't leave her out there			0
who else is she going to torment , who else is she going to harass ? ' he said			0
but sheriff @entity16 also announced last week that the bullying may have only been one part of @entity11 's decision to commit suicide			1
@entity16 said that @entity11 was also having problems at home and these may have contributed to the state of her mind on the day of her death			1
he told @entity45 she slept on a recliner instead of a bed and her sister slept on the couch , while the girls ' clothes were kept in ' grocery sacks ' in the living room			0
