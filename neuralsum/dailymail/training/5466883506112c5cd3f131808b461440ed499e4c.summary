@entity2 , the top @entity3 at the @entity4 , has ‘ gone native ’ and now gets on ‘ famously well ’ with the @entity5 , an aide to chancellor @entity1 has claimed			1
@entity6 was forced to defend his close colleague , insisting his ‘ heart is exactly where it should be			2
’ but privately many @entity12 dems fear that mr @entity2 has grown rather too comfortable with the conservatives			1
@entity3 @entity2 ( left ) faces accusations that he has got too close to @entity5 chancellor @entity1 while working at the @entity4 @entity5 mp @entity16 , a backbench aide to mr @entity1 , made the claim about mr @entity2 at an event for conservatives in @entity20 yesterday			1
according to @entity21 , mr @entity16 said : ‘ the treasury team gets on famously well			1
the relationship between @entity1 and @entity2 is very , very good			1
‘ i think @entity6 complains quite often that @entity2 has gone native in the @entity4			1
i think there is some truth in the fact he has gone native in the @entity4			0
the relationship is very good within the treasury team			2
’ however , the comments will provoke alarm in @entity3 ranks at a time when the party is desperate to differentiate themselves from their @entity5 coalition partners			2
in the @entity39 today , mr @entity6 was forced to defend his closest ally from claims of being a closet @entity5 taken hostage by mr @entity1			1
the deputy prime minister dismissed the reports , telling the @entity39 that mr @entity16 was as good a ‘ wing man ’ as the @entity47 legend @entity46 , who famously fell in to the sea when the wax in his wings melted in the sun. deputy prime minister @entity6 insisted mr @entity2 's heart is in the right place and he insisted that mr @entity2 's resistance to cutting the top rate of tax for the wealthiest earners showed he was a true @entity3 , at a time when @entity5 want it reduced from 45p to 40p			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ i have just see these quotes from mr @entity16			2
he claims he is extremely close to the chancellor , that he knows his mind , that he is the chancellor 's wing man			2
well , he is as good a wing man as @entity46 was in flying off on his own to judge by his comments			0
‘ the chief secretary to the treasury is doing an outstanding job on behalf of the government and on behalf of the @entity3			0
‘ only last week he was saying that further cuts for the very wealthiest in society will happen over “ his dead body ”			0
that , and so many other examples , show his @entity3 heart is exactly where it should be			0
’ mr @entity6 's comments followed a question from @entity81 mp @entity80 who asked : ‘ i know you will be aware of the concept of @entity85 , where captives increasingly empathise with their captors			2
what are you going to do to de-programme the @entity4 one ? ’ a coalition row erupted last week when mr @entity2 insisted that the top rate of tax for highest earners would be cut to 40p ‘ over my dead body ’			1
the chief secretary to the treasury said he would never allow it to happen ahead of the 2015 election			0
but @entity5 @entity98 mayor @entity97 said the current 45p rate was not reasonable , and warned the @entity3 about make bold threats because the last thing he wanted to see was ‘ the dead body of @entity2 ’			1
the future of the tax rate paid by people earning more than £ 150,000 has become a major political battleground			0
the treasury team gets on ' famously well ' , according to @entity5 mp @entity16 , a backbench aide to mr @entity1 in the last weeks of the @entity81 government then - chancellor @entity108 increased it from 40p to 50p			1
mr @entity1 then cut it to 45p in 2012 , claiming the measure had raised ‘ next to nothing ’ for the @entity4			0
@entity114 has vowed to return it to 50p if @entity81 wins the next election , but @entity5 are pushing for it to be reduced further to 40p			0
however mr @entity2 , the second most senior @entity3 in the government , refused to yield to the @entity119 demands			1
‘ i think it is right at 45 per cent			0
i would n't go to cutting below 45 per cent , ’ he told the @entity120			0
‘ i would say that would happen over my dead body			0

@entity5 aide to @entity1 claims treasury team ' gets on famously '
claims risks alarming @entity3 who fear mr @entity2 is too right wing
@entity6 insists @entity2 's heart is in the right place
