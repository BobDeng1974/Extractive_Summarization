by @entity0 , chief political correspondent published : 12:46 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 03:35 est , 22 august 2013 @entity1 was told to look in the mirror and ask whether the ' electorate ever assent to me being prime minister ? ' @entity1 should consider resigning for the sake of the @entity7 , a senior blairite warned yesterday			1
@entity8 , who served as energy minister under @entity10 , said the @entity7 leader had a duty to ' look in the mirror and honestly answer the question : ' will the electorate ever assent to me being prime minister ? ' mr @entity8 , who held a number of other senior roles , said opinion poll findings on mr @entity1 's personal popularity were ' somewhere between dire and disappointing '			1
he said @entity7 could not afford to follow mr @entity1 ' lemming like ' to defeat , as it had with @entity24 and @entity25			1
in a further blow , mr @entity1 came under fire from one of his own frontbench team over his failure to ' do more ' to make the positive case for immigration			1
shadow public health minister @entity33 suggested mr @entity1 privately supported immigration and had his ' heart in the right place '			1
but she said he was too swayed by opinion polls on the issue showing that the open door approach of the last @entity7 government was now deeply unpopular			2
she said ' what weighs with him is the polling which shows what the @entity43 are doing on immigration is popular and it certainly weighs on other members of the shadow cabinet			0
' mr @entity8 joins a chorus of despair from senior @entity7 figures about mr @entity1 's performance as party leader			1
writing in the @entity52 , he said there was no shame in leaders accepting they were not up to the job			0
he pointed out that both @entity57 and @entity58 had gone on to high office after putting in dismal performances as party leaders			0
bad day : @entity1 found himself under attack from former energy secretary @entity8 who described his personal popularity as ' somewhere between dire and disappointing ' no more : mr @entity8 claims the party can not afford to follow ' lemming like ' behind another failing leader who will lose the election as they did with @entity25 and @entity24 , right ' giving leadership a decent shot and then getting out does not necessarily mean the end of a political career - a consideration that should make it easier for future doomed leaders to consider their options , ' he said			1
' he must look in the mirror and honestly answer the question : will the electorate ever assent to me being prime minister ? ' ex-energy minister @entity8 yesterday he backed growing calls for mr @entity1 to bring back heavyweight figures such as former chancellor @entity83 and former home secretary @entity84			1
he added : ' of course , there is a risk in that for @entity1 because it is possible that he would not shine as leaders should in the company of their colleagues			2
but there is a bigger risk in ploughing on as before with a lightweight team that appears to hop from one opportunist issue to the next , has failed to develop a strong , appealing narrative and is hanging on to a poll lead that could be blown away by the first whiff of electoral grapeshot			0
' mr @entity8 said mr @entity1 was ' not yet ' at the point reached by @entity24 where defeat is inevitable			1
but he suggested @entity7 should be more ruthless than in the past if his performance continues to disappoint and he refuses to stand aside			2
he added : ' @entity7 has a dismal record of indecisiveness even when all common sense suggests that its leader is not going to make it past the winning post			1
partly , this is due to the unwieldiness of its internal machinery while kindness and loyalty are also significant factors , though the true kindness would sometimes be to act rather than acquiesce			0
' mr @entity8 also criticised mr @entity1 for his failure to defend the record of the last @entity7 government , adding : ' @entity1 and his unattractive shadow chancellor , @entity121 , have spent far too much of the past two years apologising for the record rather than defending it , which is the prerequisite for offering a credible alternative			1
' the criticism comes as a senior member of the shadow cabinet admits that a u-turn over the universal credit reforms may feature on their election manifesto			0
former leader hopeful @entity33 also challenged @entity1 today saying that he is too swayed by opinion polls when forming his policies in a speech in @entity135 today , shadow work and pensions secretary @entity133 launched stinging attacks at @entity58 for not implementing the plans better , claiming there ' seems to be something very wrong in the mind ' of the the @entity142			1
but having vehemently opposed the changes to the benefits system he says his party now wants to work with the government to turn around the universal credit reforms and ' hopes ' to run at the next general election pledging to keep the new system			0
he said he would be writing to mr @entity58 urging him to convene cross party talks with civil servants to save the flagship universal credit reforms from becoming a ' sinking ship			0
' but despite his criticism when asked if he now wanted the policy to succeed he agreed , saying : ' i hope so , i sincerely hope so , but right now we have had so much dissembling we do n’t know what is going on			0
' if we ’re going to get things straight , the first step is to put the cards on the table , tell us what is going wrong and perhaps we can work together			0
' but mr @entity133 added that despite his criticism his own party , should they win the next election , would also implement a scheme of benefit reform			0
in a speech to the mentoring charity @entity172 he described his rival reforms as ' tackling the long - term drivers of spending ' , insisting @entity7 ’s plans would be based on the twin principles of the ' care ethic ' and the ' work ethic			2
' @entity7 's shadow secretary of state for work and pensions @entity133 claims that if the party won the next election he would launch their own version of the much condemned benefits change but his claims were dismissed by the opposition with mr @entity58 ’s spokeswoman said mr @entity133 ’s figures were ' nonsense			1
' she said : ' this is a last - ditch attempt by @entity133 to keep his job in the shadow cabinet.nothing more			0
' his talk of wasted money is frankly laughable when you consider @entity7 have voted against £ 83 billion - worth of savings to the welfare budget			2
' @entity7 is panicking - after a summer of discontent , here is yet another disastrous speech , void of any ideas			2
' same old @entity7 is in the wrong place on welfare			2
' they want people on benefits to make more money than the average hard - working family earns			0
' they want unlimited amounts of benefits to be a basic human right			0
' @entity7 have even gone as far as to ban the word ‘ welfare ’ in the hopes we all forget they are the @entity217			2
' the taxpayer supports what we ’re doing on welfare and @entity1 has got it wrong yet @entity223 credit is intended to roll six current benefits - including jobseeker ’s allowance , working tax credits and housing benefit - into a single monthly payment and is currently being piloted			0
labour sources yesterday dismissed mr @entity8 's criticism and said mr @entity1 was focusing on getting the party 's message across at next month 's party conference .			1

@entity8 says @entity7 leader needs to look at himself ' honestly '
calls his personal popularity ' somewhere between dire and disappointing '
claims that under @entity1 the part has ' a dismal record of indecisiveness '
and the he and ' *unnattractive* ' @entity121 have spent too much time apologising for the previous governments and not enough defending it
