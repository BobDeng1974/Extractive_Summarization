with his lively eyebrows , winkled cheeks and eyes that follow you around the room - this state - of - the - art robotic head is menacingly lifelike			2
the humanoid , known as @entity8 , has been drawing in crowds with his incredible range of facial expressions at an electronics event in @entity14 this week			1
the head , designed by @entity17 robotics designer @entity16 , is able to answer basic questions and can also be used in the simulation of medical scenarios			1
the head is created with malleable material called @entity35 using soft - bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology			1
it contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across ( there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre )			0
using specialised software the machine can recognise and respond to a number of human facial expressions in a natural way			1
according to @entity16 's website , the humanoids can actually see your face , make eye contact with you , and understand speech to ' engage you in witty dialogue '			0
such reactions are a major feat of engineering , according to chief designer @entity16 , the founder and and president of @entity16			0
reactive : the robot smiles using multiple motors - which whir into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes state - of - the - art : the head is created with malleable material using soft - bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology			1
it contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across ( there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre ) it is not the first human - looking robot that his firm has created either			2
an earlier version of @entity8 drew headlines as it was sculpted to look like @entity79 , complete with a bushy moustache and a shock of white hair			0
the @entity79 humanoid made facial expressions by using multiple motors - which whir into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes			2
mr @entity16 sees robotics as his calling and works on many fronts , from sculpting features to developing artificial intelligence			0
to advance to the next step of producing robots for everyday applications in entertainment , health care and education , he decided to move to @entity14 with his family - his wife @entity103 and their son @entity104			0
the city has a booming robotics community with a high amount of expertise and design infrastructure and new technology can be developed at a lower cost than in the @entity17			0
leading designer : mr @entity16 sees robotics as his calling and works on many fronts , from sculpting features to developing artificial intelligence on show : @entity8 is currently on exhibit at the @entity26 spring electronics show at @entity27 - the largest event of its kind in the world previous model : the @entity79 robot , which made its public debut at the @entity128 conference in the @entity17 in 2009 , was developed at the @entity129 ( @entity129 )			1
