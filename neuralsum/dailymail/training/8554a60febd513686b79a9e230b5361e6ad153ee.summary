by @entity0 published : 22:55 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 02:56 est , 28 march 2013 care : mothers who devote their time to raising their children at the expense of their career must not be penlaised , says the @entity7 of @entity8 stay - at - home mothers are being unfairly penalised for their ‘ principled decision ’ not to go out to work , a bishop said last night			1
the @entity7 added to growing criticism of the government ’s failure to support mothers who sacrifice their professional lives to look after their children			1
describing stay - at - home mothers as ‘ the glue which enables us to be a healthy society ’ , the @entity19 @entity18 said his views were shared by a number of bishops			1
the bishop , who sits in the @entity27 , told the @entity28 the biggest impact of the government ’s policies is on traditional families in ‘ middle @entity33 ’			0
he said : ‘ the concern for me is for those who have made a principled decision to stay at home and taken the financial hit			1
it is actually unfair and against the government ’s own rhetoric			0
‘ where one parent makes a conscious decision to stay at home for the children … they should n’t be penalised			1
‘ the evidence is that what the parent is doing is investing in a child ’s development which can save the state significant amounts of money at a later stage			0
‘ it helps children to develop into adults who are more likely to fulfil their potential and make a net contribution to society			1
’ the government has received marked criticism after the removing child benefit from wealthier families with one breadwinner , restricting financial help to those mothers returning to work , and repeatedly delaying tax breaks for married couples			2
the bishop , a father - of - three with four grandchildren , said he remained ‘ eternally grateful ’ to his own parents for the fact that he always found one of them at home when he came back from school			1
‘ we hear a great deal of talk about ‘ @entity84 ’ and here we have families making a deliberate choice to make their contribution to the glue which enables us to be a healthy society , ’ he said			2
‘ there ’s a lot of research which shows getting parenting right in those early years has a positive impact on health , on education and on social behaviour , ’ the bishop added			0
the bishop says the government must do more to support mothers who dedicate themselves entirely to family ‘ we hear a lot from the government about support for this and yet that rhetoric does not seem to be translated into public policy			2
‘ i have a general concern that we ’ve had a lot of rhetoric about the support for family life and good parenting			0
if the rhetoric had substance i would expect that to be reflected in public policy decisions			0
’ the bishop also defended parents who feel they have no choice but to stay home because of their belief in family life			2
he said child benefit tax changes had been based on an assumption that families had chosen the one - earner option ‘ as a luxury , ’ adding : ‘ in many cases , it does n’t feel like that			0
' it feels like something you have to do if you are truly committed to that network of relationships that help to make for a healthy society			0

@entity19 @entity18 says policy punishes mothers without *jobs*
