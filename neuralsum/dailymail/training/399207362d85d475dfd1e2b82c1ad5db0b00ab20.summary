by @entity0 last updated at 12:43 pm on 15th january 2012 shame : @entity2 murdered her son @entity3 and concealed his death			1
she has been jailed for a minimum of 15 years a woman who murdered her toddler son and left his body in a cot for so long it ' mummified ' was today jailed for a minimum of 15 years			1
@entity2 , 37 , was found guilty by a majority verdict last month of murdering her son @entity3 at a flat in @entity14 , @entity15			1
his decomposing body was found in a cot in march 2010 - eight months after he was last seen			1
@entity2 was also convicted of failing to report @entity3 ’s death to police or other authorities and of concealing his body at the flat			1
at the @entity23 in @entity24 , she was handed a life sentence and told she will spend a minimum of 15 years behind bars			1
@entity2 was also sentenced to seven years for attempting to defeat the ends of justice , which will run concurrently with the 15 years			2
the court heard that the child ’s body was partially ' mummified ' when it was found on march 30 , when he would have been 23 months old			2
he was last seen alive in august 2009 and experts estimated he had been dead for up to eight months			1
sentencing @entity2 , lord @entity36 said : ' @entity3 ’s first birthday took place in april 2009 , he appeared to have all his life in front of him			1
' he was surrounded by a loving family and people thought you were a loving mother			0
a few months later he was dead			2
' lord @entity36 said : ' you were @entity3 's carer			2
you did not allow others to get close to him			0
instead you isolated him from your family , your neighbours , your friends and from the welfare services			0
' none of them thought that @entity3 's life was at risk			1
' the jury convicted you of willfully ill - treating and neglecting @entity3 , of failing to provide him with adequate nourishment and fluids , of leaving him alone unattended for excessive periods of time , and of failing to seek and provide medical aid and care for him			1
' in addition , you took significant steps to cover up what happened			0
i take all these matters into account in assessing the seriousness of the crime			0
' he added : ' you embarked on a systematic and elaborate course of conduct to prevent people knowing , or suspecting , that @entity3 was dead			1
' it was a lengthy course of deceit that prevented proper inquiries being made			0
' he said that @entity3 's death had a ' devastating effect ' on the family			1
in mitigation , he acknowledged that @entity2 had had difficulty with drink and drugs and that her son 's death was a ' huge tragedy ' for her , as she said she loved the boy ' more than anything in the world '			1
@entity2 's defence counsel @entity92 said his client , a former heroin addict , denied killing the child			1
he said : ' as far as miss @entity2 is concerned , she is still adamant that she had no involvement in the death of her child			1
' her position is that she found @entity3 dead in the morning , as she stated in her evidence , and her actions afterwards in relation to the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice were as a consequence of that			1
' that position is one that she has held at consultation from the outset			0
she held it during evidence and it is one she will continue to hold after the sentence			2
' rubbish strewn cot : the bed where @entity118 was left dead for up to eight months is filled with waste including empty bottles of @entity121 , 3 @entity123 cider , @entity124 , vodka and crisp packets			1
on the table are strewn cans of @entity130 lager and more snack packaging , with more rubbish on the floor the cause of @entity3 ’s death is not known			1
@entity2 pretended the child was being cared for by family members or that he was at nursery , leading people to believe he was still alive			1
following the trial the @entity140 yesterday released photographs of rooms inside @entity2 's flat piled with rubbish			2
one shows what appears to be a travel cot or playpen filled with empty plastic bottles and debris while others show apparently mouldy milk bottles			0
filthy : a dirty kitchen counter in the flat in @entity14 , @entity15 , covered in unwashed dishes , empty containers including @entity158 margarine , @entity160 butter , a host of microwave meals , hamburger packaging and a bottle of pills squalid : a table in the living room is covered in dirty plates , cans of beer , @entity121 , shampoo bottles , a @entity168 container stuffed with cigarette butts , a curry house menu and even @entity177 cards @entity178 is considering whether a @entity179 ( @entity180 ) should be held into his death			0
a report on the case was commissioned by @entity185 , the independent chairman of the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) , on behalf of @entity187 and the @entity24 and @entity189 health board			0
the @entity186 oversees the services and agencies which look after vulnerable children in the area and will consider the report later this month before it goes to the appropriate council policy board			0
shocking : bottles of rotten milk in various states of decay line up along the top of a radiator near @entity3 's cot a number of changes recommended in the report have already been implemented in @entity15			1
@entity206 leader @entity205 has called for an inquiry into the death and said she was seeking a meeting with the first minister to explore how best to address the ' scandal ' of child abuse			0
a @entity215 spokesman said : ' the death of @entity118 was an appalling tragedy and these shocking images simply underline the dreadful suffering he was forced to endure			0
' the first minister will consider any request for a meeting and a decision on holding a @entity179 is a matter for the law officers			0
' the @entity215 is ensuring protection is in place for all children at risk of neglect , and in 2010 launched new @entity231 guidance clearly outlining expectations for local risk assessment procedures - including where children are in potential danger from substance misuse issues			0
' barely room to walk : photos taken by investigators also show several empty vodka bottles , dorito packets , clothes alongside a bag of nappies appalling : a remote control on a reclining sofa is swamped by a dirty duvet , beer cans , lighters , cigarette papers , tobacco , ashes , crisp packets and a half - eaten microwave meal evidence of a young life : @entity3 's bedroom with a wardrobe filled with a few of his tiny outfits with toys on top			1
right , his barely used push chair surrounded by rubbish pitiful : despite the squalor elsewhere , @entity3 's socks and slippers are arranged neatly beside toys and a fabric book on a shelf @entity272 detective inspector @entity271 said : ' i take no personal satisfaction from the sentence delivered to @entity2 today , although i am satisfied that justice has been served			1
' this has been a very traumatic time for @entity3 's family and i sincerely hope that they can now try and move on with their life			2
' @entity118 's death was a harrowing and tragic case			0
' i doubt that anyone involved in the investigation or who has followed any of the media coverage of the case will have encountered anything quite as distressing			0
' a team of highly - experienced detective and uniform officers worked on this inquiry			0
they were supported by some of the best forensic experts in the country			0
' i would like to thank those officers for their commitment and professionalism whilst working on this harrowing investigation			0
wretched : @entity3 's bedroom with the floor covered in clothes and toys , including the box of a @entity307 grime : an empty milk bottle sits alongside several packets of @entity310 and a bottle of @entity312 beside the tv set ' we will never know the extent of @entity3 's suffering , nor will we ever understand how a mother could behave in this way towards an innocent and defenceless child , her own child			2
' there was one person and one person alone who was responsible for @entity3 's death , and that was his mother @entity2			1
' she deceived everyone who was close to her			0
she went out of her way to conceal what she did from her friends , her family and also from the various agencies who only wanted to help her			0
' @entity334 , district procurator fiscal for @entity14 , said : ' @entity118 was born a healthy child			0
' however , he was later neglected and murdered by his mother , @entity2			2
she then concealed @entity3 's body and embarked upon a course of deception in which she led others to believe that he was still alive			2
' this was a tragic and distressing case and today @entity2 has been rightly punished by the court for her actions			2
' health hazard : the filthy and stained toilet in the flat with dirty clothes strewn around it			0
