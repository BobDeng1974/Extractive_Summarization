' as in anything , i think so much of the fear is the unknown , ' @entity9 said			0

' dr. @entity62 , an associate professor of medicine at the @entity64 and co-director of the @entity66 said even though there are no other confirmed cases of @entity3 on other @entity15 teams that he does n't feel players and staff in @entity1 are at any higher risk of coming in contact with @entity3			1

@entity24 has filed a complaint with the players union when the team listed him on the non-football injury list			0

we will reach out to the @entity104 player representatives today and provide them with our best medical guidance and regular updates from the outside experts			0

the team hired a company to sanitize @entity1 , the team 's headquarters and training facility , on two separate occasions in an effort to minimize the prospect of other cases			1
not related : health officials say that @entity7 ( above ) and @entity24 infections are not related , and that neither contracted it from the other			2
they are trying to determine now how the third player contracted the infection famous : @entity24 ( 9 ) twice kicked the @entity137 to the @entity138 with @entity139 - winning overtime field goals the @entity1 said at the time they did not know where @entity7 and @entity24 were exposed to @entity3			1
@entity62 did not plan to recommend a third cleaning of the facility , but that he was working with the team on things players can do themselves to minimize the risk of getting @entity3			2

the expert said the cases involving @entity7 and @entity24 do not appear to be related , explaining there are different strains of @entity3			1

' but we can actually definitely say that the first two cases were not related to each other			0
' usually contracted by people in hospitals or other medical facilities resistant to most antibiotic treatments can lead to deadly flesh - eating bacteria can remain in the body for years while being treated the superbug killed more people than @entity171 in 2011 and , the doctor said @entity7 and @entity24 did not get the infection from one another			1
