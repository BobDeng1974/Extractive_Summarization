@entity1 @entity0 has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in a trial which could cost the taxpayer £ 10,000 a jury trial to find out whether a @entity1 put his hand on a @entity10 woman ’s bare leg will cost at least £ 10,000			1
a judge yesterday questioned whether such an outlay is needed over an apparently drunken incident outside a nightclub			0
lasting three to four days , the trial will require both a @entity1 interpreter for the defendant and at least one @entity10 interpreter for the victim and witnesses			1
if it does last four days , it will cost at least £ 8,600 , according to @entity23 figures			1
with interpreters costing £ 615 each – plus their expenses – the trial could result in a five - figure bill for taxpayers			1
@entity0 , 25 , has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , last april , two months after he moved from @entity1 to the @entity31			1
the carpenter and joiner , who is believed to work for @entity34 , has also denied assaulting the woman ’s fiance			2
judge @entity37 asked prosecutor @entity38 if it was correct that the allegation is that @entity0 drunkenly touched the woman ’s pelvis area over her clothing			1
mr @entity38 said : ‘ it was her bare leg and an attempt was made to touch between her legs			0
she was wearing a short skirt			0
’ the judge then told @entity48 : ‘ so we are having a three to four day trial to determine whether or not this defendant touched a lady ’s leg when he was drunk outside a nightclub ? ’ he questioned why @entity0 , who says he is in a relationship on his @entity57 profile , had not been offered a police caution , as would usually happen in such cases			1
administered by police , a caution is an alternative to prosecution used to resolve minor cases where a full – and costly – prosecution is not deemed necessary			2
mr @entity38 said the decision to proceed with the charges against @entity0 was partly because there was an independent witness , a security guard , who claims to have seen the sexual assault in @entity48			2
@entity72 of the @entity73 ’ @entity71 said : ‘ the judge ’s word is final , but taxpayers will wonder whether this case could have avoided court			0
‘ there ’s an argument that the police should make better use of the caution in situations where it is merited so that taxpayers are n’t on the hook for unnecessary court cases			2
‘ right across the justice system , the wheels must move a little quicker			0
’ the cost to the taxpayer of hiring court interpreters has almost doubled to £ 15.5million in just one year , according to official figures released last year			0
the bill for translators brought in to assist non-english speakers appearing at magistrates or crown courts for criminal cases soared from £ 7.9million in 2012			0
the three to four - day trial at @entity48 could will involve paying interpreters £ 615 each , plus expensses , according to @entity23 figures the figures , uncovered in @entity107 responses from the @entity23 , appear to show the rise occurred since services were outsourced to under - fire firm @entity110 and @entity111			1
they were revealed after the handling of court foreign language services to just one company was branded ‘ shambolic ’ by mps amid concerns the change had caused trials to collapse or be delayed			0
farcical episodes that have emerged since privatisation include the case of a man who was charged with perverting the course of justice was instead accused of being a ‘ pervert ’			0
and in a burglary case at @entity128 in east @entity129 , a retrial was ordered when it emerged that the @entity1 interpreter had muddled the words ‘ beaten ’ and ‘ bitten ’			1
earlier this month it was revealed that taxpayers are spending at total of £ 100million every year on interpreters to help immigrants who can not speak @entity138			0
police , town halls , hospitals and courts are all spending huge sums on translating documents and providing professional interpreters to assist people with poor @entity138			0
the most common nationalities to require interpreters in @entity31 are @entity10 , @entity149 and @entity1			1
@entity0 has been bailed and will appear at @entity48 for trial on june 22			2

four - day trial will need one @entity1 and at least one @entity10 interpreter
each interpreter costs £ 615 plus expenses , according to @entity23
