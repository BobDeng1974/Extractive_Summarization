it 's game over for @entity2 's iconic @entity1			1
where once @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and so many more created magic memories for the city 's sports fans in spite of it 's famously blustery winds , heavy machinery is now taking the stadium apart piece by piece			2
there is no room for sentiment for the demolition crew brought in after a successful public petition against more direct methods , such as dynamite and wrecking balls , extended the wait for the site 's next incarnation as a $ 200million ( £ 130m ) urban outlet mall			0
the mall will open some time in 2017 , but the rich history of where it will stand is undeniable			2
not just a previous home for the @entity36 's @entity35 and briefly the @entity37 , along with baseball 's @entity38 after their move from @entity41 , it hosted what would be @entity44 ' last full live concert			1
developer @entity70 , along with partner and mall - owner @entity68 , have plans in place for a 500,000 - square - foot mall on a site that will also include 6,225 homes , 635,000 square feet of shops and 220 hotel rooms			1
crew at the stadium wear orange but it 's no homage to the @entity38 , just safety vests			1
the @entity85 earthquake measuring 7.1 on the @entity86 on october 17 , 1989 , minutes before game three of the @entity83 was supposed to start , could n't fell @entity1			0
the stadium was credited with saving lives that day , with no one inside injured			0
but massive excavators are making short work of it			0
unimaginative but lasting catch phrases are a lasting legacy of ' @entity54 ' , named after its @entity95 location in the @entity97 area on the west shore of @entity99 it 's home to ' @entity101 ' , the 1982 heroics of @entity103 , who clutched @entity5 's match - winning touchdown pass against the @entity105 to lead the 49ers to their first @entity107			2
it was the first of eight @entity110 games there			0
the seats that were n't sold to collectors for $ 649 a pair are ruthlessly ripped up during the demolition of @entity1 an orange pile of chairs ready for recycling is crushed by machinery as the site is prepared for a $ 200m urban outlet mall @entity1 was first opened in 1960 to be the home of @entity38 baseball team after they moved from @entity41 two more great plays are remembered as @entity128 - @entity127 ' receipt of a @entity129 pass in the 1998 wild card round for a touchdown with eight seconds on the clock to beat the @entity133 and @entity135 ' grab from @entity136 with nine seconds left for the win over the @entity138 in the 2011 @entity139			1
originally opened in 1960 , @entity54 was built to be the home of @entity141 's @entity38 and was the first ' modern ' baseball stadium given it was built entirely from concrete			1
with then @entity146 vice president @entity145 throwing out the first pitch on opening day , it was home to two @entity149 in 1961 and 1984 and the 1962 and 1989 @entity83			0
the stands are being torn down piece by piece after a community petition fought against the potential impact of dust from more direct methods a worker wears the orange colour of the @entity38 but it 's no homage to the team , just a high - visibility safety vest a pile of stadium seats sits in an empty section inside @entity1 on february 4 as the destruction of the stadium continues a @entity146 flag flops on a pile of broken pallets and trash outside the stadium broken stadium seats are bound for recycling after being torn from the venue of @entity44 ' final live concert the tunnel that visiting @entity36 team 's once entered the arena from is now framed by bald stands after the distinctive seats were removed while sporting battles were won and lost at the venue , @entity1 has never looked as much like a war zone as this the former playing field of @entity1 is also being ripped up as the foundations for the urban outlet mall and apartments are prepared the @entity38 stayed until their move to @entity189 ( now @entity189 ) in 2000 , perhaps facing the also former @entity41 - based side the @entity191 in the final baseball game there , leaving the 49ers as @entity54 's sole occupants			1
the 49ers ' time there stretched from 1971 to 2013 , before they went to @entity199 in @entity200 , with their final match there their 36th for @entity202 - the most of any ground			2
the 34 – 24 win over the @entity205 was dubbed @entity206 by pundits			0
it 's not been confirmed whether there will be any remnants of @entity54 once the development is complete , in the vein of @entity214 's former home at @entity215 where the facade was retained at the front of apartments , but the memories will live on			0
legendary @entity2 49ers quarterback @entity5 runs with the ball during the 1984 @entity110 at @entity1 @entity5 ( right ) takes a knee to speak with @entity35 head coach @entity222 in the match against the @entity224 , which they won 23 - 0 superstar outfielder @entity3 moved with the @entity38 from @entity41 to @entity2 as they took up residence at @entity54 the scoreboard displays the message ' tell it goodbye to @entity1 ' after the @entity38 final match at the stadium against the @entity191			1

@entity1 was opened in 1960 as the home for @entity141 's @entity38
the @entity35 were based at the famously windy ground from 1971 to their departure in 2013
developers @entity70 are *replacing* the stadium with a 500,000 - square - foot mall which should open in 2017
