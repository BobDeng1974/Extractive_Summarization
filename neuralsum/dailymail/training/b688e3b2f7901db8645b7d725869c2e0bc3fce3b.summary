@entity0 , who attracts more controversy away from football than any other mainstream pundit , appears at @entity5 magistrates court on thursday morning charged with four driving offences			1
@entity0 , @entity7 ’s lead football expert , drove his @entity8 at around 10mph in excess of the various speed limits			2
he already has three points on his driving license according to court documents and risks a long driving ban			1
it is expected @entity0 will follow the example of @entity28 , who escaped a driving ban last august by claiming it would seriously hamper his charity work			1
the footballer - turned - pundit already has three points on his driving license and risks a long ban the latest of almost daily revelations emanating from @entity36 is that former club owners @entity38 claim to have sworn witness statements by bank compliance officers that the former @entity36 managing director @entity42 deposited around 100 false invoices for over £ 4m into four accounts held in @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
a spokesman for @entity42 , who has spent 136 days in prison in @entity46 , said : ‘ @entity42 continues to maintain his complete innocence			0
’ former @entity53 captain @entity52 summed up the game ’s low opinion of the @entity57 ’s decision to charge @entity59 captain @entity58 with racist abuse			0
in his speech at the @entity62 , @entity52 ( right ) parodied what @entity58 said to @entity64 , saying : ‘ if there are any @entity67 in the room , can you f * * * off back to your own country			0
’ @entity59 captain @entity58 was charged with racist abuse towards @entity64 by the @entity57 lt is hard to fathom why the @entity71 have given @entity73 manager @entity72 and his coaching staff extended six - year contracts until after the @entity76 when everything depends on how they do in the tournament on home soil in 2015			1
fears that they may be poached or a desire at @entity83 for long - term continuity will be irrelevant if @entity73 fail to get out of their difficult @entity76 group			0
and the @entity71 will not reveal whether the contracts have get - out clauses			1
chief executive @entity87 , who made the contract recommendations that the board approved , said : ‘ we are not going into the details			0
there is ongoing assessment about the team ’s performance , but we have absolute faith in @entity72 and his team			2
’ @entity73 head coach @entity72 has signed as new contract until after the @entity76 royal @entity99 look certain to follow the example of the @entity102 , who have voted to admit female members for the first time			1
the sandwich - based club , who hosted the @entity108 in 2011 , when former minister for sport @entity109 led the chorus of disapproval of their male - only membership , have already canvassed members ’ views ahead of an official ballot at the start of next year			2
it is understood the vast majority agreed when consulted that women should finally be allowed in after 127 years			0
club secretary @entity122 said : ‘ i imagine that to be the case , but we need to hold a proper ballot and consider all the ramifications			0
’ @entity127 won the 2011 @entity108 held at the @entity99 held in @entity128 , @entity53 the opinions of @entity130 have been given extra credence since the @entity132 revealed they may put him forward next year as the @entity135 candidate for the vacant @entity137 vice-presidency on the @entity139 executive			1
and @entity130 neatly summed up the main obstacle to @entity135 success at international level in the @entity144 - launched excerpt from his new book # 2sides			1
@entity146 writes : ‘ the @entity147 is completely detached from the ideas and vision of the @entity132 and vice versa			2
the barrier has to be broken down			0
the big clubs have very little interest in the national team			0
all they care about is what benefits them and they think mainly in terms of money			0
the @entity132 is not strong enough to decide a policy and dictate from the centre			2
