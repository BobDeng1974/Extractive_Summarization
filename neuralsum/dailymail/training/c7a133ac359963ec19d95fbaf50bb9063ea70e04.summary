@entity0 yesterday dismissed claims he delayed the inquiry into the @entity3 ' again and again ' by voting against it being set up			1
@entity5 said the report would have been published ' years ago ' had it not been for @entity7 blocking the plans – with mr @entity0 himself voting against an inquiry on four occasions			1
the @entity12 leader hit back saying he wanted the report published as soon as possible – and claiming his anti-war stance was ' well known '			2
but that is not how his brother @entity16 and the shadow chancellor @entity17 remember it			2
former foreign secretary @entity5 told his brother he could not credibly claim to be against the @entity21 war because he never made his views known at the time			2
mr @entity17 went even further – dismissing the claim that the @entity12 leader was against the war as ' ridiculous '			1
former foreign secretary @entity16 ( left ) told his brother @entity26 ( right ) he could not credibly claim to be against the @entity21 war because he never made his views known at the time the allegations were made during a heated @entity12 leadership hustings in 2010 , when mr @entity0 was trashing @entity12 's foreign policy record to distance himself from his brother in the race to succeed @entity31			1
in a two - hour debate hosted on @entity33 , mr @entity17 said : ' i do not think @entity26 or any of the rest of us can claim with any credibility that in 2003 we thought the war was wrong but we just forgot to tell anyone , because that would make us look ridiculous			1
' mr @entity0 insisted he opposed the war at the time of the invasion in 2003 but was living in the @entity44 , so his views were not known in the @entity46			1
but @entity16 said : ' @entity47 is the only candidate that can say she was against the war at the time , and if that is the sole criterion , she is in a different position to every other candidate			0
she did not just think she was against it , she said she was against it , and she marched against it			0
' @entity0 insisted on his opposition : ' i did tell people at the time that asked me that i was against the war			0
' but mr @entity17 said under his breath ' you did not tell people ' and pointed out that in 2005 , when the @entity66 newspaper asked @entity12 figures whether they would have voted for the war , @entity26 did not answer the question			2
@entity16 ( right ) , @entity0 ( second right ) and @entity17 ( left ) went up against each other to win the @entity12 leadership @entity0 yesterday insisted that his views on the @entity3 were ' well known ' - but mr @entity17 has previously insisted that was not the case the remarks undermine mr @entity0 's claim during yesterday 's prime minister 's questions that he opposed the @entity3 from the beginning			1
despite the row dominating news bulletins all day , mr @entity0 skated over the issue at @entity78 's questions – dismissing it in two sentences			0
the @entity12 leader did not even ask mr @entity5 about the issue , saying only that he agreed the report should be ' published as soon as possible '			2
@entity7 opposed a series of proposals for an inquiry in the @entity91 until one was ordered by @entity31			0
mr @entity0 personally voted against starting an inquiry on four occasions as an mp , first in october 2006 , then in june 2007 , once more in march 2008 and again in march 2009			1
several former senior @entity12 figures , including mr @entity0 's brother @entity5 , will come under scrutiny when the report is finally published			1
at the start of prime minister 's questions , mr @entity0 said : ' let me start by saying , on the @entity21 inquiry , that it was set up six years ago and i agree with the prime minister that it should be published as soon as possible			1
' he then moved swiftly on to the economy			0
the pm countered , saying the report would have been published ' years ago ' had @entity7 voted in favour of setting up the inquiry earlier			0
' so perhaps he could start by recognising his own regret at voting against the establishment of the inquiry , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 was at a business reception at @entity114 in @entity114 , @entity115 today @entity5 was in @entity116 today - his first visit to @entity118 today since the independence referendum last september mr @entity0 replied : ' the inquiry was established six years ago , after our combat operations had ended , and frankly , my views on the @entity21 war are well known and i want this inquiry to be published			1
' unlike his brother , @entity0 was not an mp in 2003 in the run - up to the war			0
at the time he was at @entity130 in the @entity44			0
during his campaign for the @entity12 leadership he said the invasion was a ' profound mistake ' and claimed to have opposed it in private			0
but according to reports , his brother dismissed this claim , saying that the only candidate for the leadership who could say they were against the war at the time was @entity47 .			0

@entity0 yesterday dismissed claims he delayed the @entity3 inquiry
the pm said mr @entity0 voted against it being set up ' again and again '
mr @entity0 said he wanted it published and his anti-war views ' well known '
but his record has been *rubbished* by his brother @entity5 and @entity17
in @entity12 leadership race @entity17 dismissed anti-war claim as ' ridiculous '
@entity16 meanwhile said the claim lacked any credibility
