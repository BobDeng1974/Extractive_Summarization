by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 18:57 est , 27 july 2012 up to a million people are expected to line the route of the men ’s cycle road race today , hoping to roar @entity5 to @entity7 ’s first gold medal			1
just six days after @entity9 ’s astonishing victory in the @entity10 , @entity5 is hot favourite to win the 156 - mile @entity13 race			1
it goes from central @entity15 to @entity16 , where riders will do nine laps of hilly terrain , and back to the capital again			1
@entity43 , known as the @entity5 , is expected to be cheered on by his girlfriend , former page 3 model @entity26 , 25 – mother of his four - month - old daughter – and a tv audience of millions			2
last weekend in @entity47 , 27 , was one of the @entity50 cyclists who helped @entity51 emerge victorious			0
today roles will be reversed as @entity51 and other @entity7 cyclists try to ensure @entity5 takes gold			2
should he triumph near @entity56 at around 3.40pm , it will be the perfect start for @entity7 ’s hopes for a record haul of medals			0
there is also a growing expectation that @entity41 ’s @entity62 , 23 , will gain a medal in tomorrow ’s 87 - mile women ’s cycling race , which has the same route but involves two – as opposed to nine – circuits of @entity68			2
@entity13 organisers believe a @entity5 victory will fuel the feelgood factor in the country and inspire other @entity41 competitors			2
the men ’s and women ’s road races are two of the most eagerly awaited events of the @entity78			1
viewing is largely free and the races come at a time of unprecedented interest in top - level cycling			0
today ’s race , which starts at 10am , takes riders from the heart of @entity15 , through @entity87 and into the @entity16 countryside where they will make nine ascents of @entity68 , and back to the @entity31			1
thousands of police and security officers will be on duty amid fears that a publicity - seeking protest group might try to pull off a stunt that could damage @entity5 ’s chances			2

but few will care about the disruption if @entity5 , who is renowned for his blistering speed on the home straight , is victorious			2
he says he feels no additional pressure despite potentially being the first home champion of @entity135			0
he said : ‘ an @entity13 medal , regardless if it ’s the first or last on offer , it ’s an @entity13 medal for your team			0

@entity7 officials will hope there is no repeat of the @entity180 spat between some of the wags during the @entity10 after @entity115 was ordered to slow down to allow @entity51 to catch up during the 11th stage			0
in a thinly - veiled jibe @entity115 ’s girlfriend , @entity185 sports photographer @entity184 , tweeted : ‘ @entity187 is also about giving the people around you , that support you , a chance to shine in their own right			0
