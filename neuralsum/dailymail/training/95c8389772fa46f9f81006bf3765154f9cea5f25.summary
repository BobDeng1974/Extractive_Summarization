when @entity1 first saw @entity2 playing for @entity3 , he knew the 17 - year - old was something special			1
immediately he instructed his former employers at the @entity7 to sign the youngster who will , under the watch of @entity1 , captain the @entity11 for the 100th time on saturday			1
in doing so , @entity2 will further cement his name into @entity11 folklore			1
it is fitting that his milestone will be reached in @entity17 , where the iconic @entity18 played his first game as captain back in 2004			2
@entity2 trains ahead of becoming the first player to captain his country in 100 tests @entity2 has been rated as ' probably our greatest rugby player ever ' by @entity11 coach @entity27 @entity2 will lead out @entity11 against @entity28 at the @entity29 on saturday @entity27 ( right ) and @entity2 share a smile ahead of the @entity11 previous test against @entity32 @entity2 ( second left ) made his @entity11 debut during the @entity35 series in @entity17 , 2004 span 2001 - 2014 matches 136 starts 130 substitute 6 @entity38 125 tries 25 won 120 lost 14 drawn 2 win % 88.97 the 33 - year - old may be reaching the closing stages of his career , but his appetite to win is no less than in his first test in 2001			1
that , according to @entity1 , is what makes his former academy graduate ‘ probably our greatest rugby player ever ’			1
‘ even now , after 136 tests , he still wants to be better , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ he ’s still knocking on the door asking , “ how can i be better ? ” @entity2 ’s game has continually evolved over time			2
’ the evolution started over dinner with his uncle at a @entity55 ’s in @entity3 , @entity11			2
@entity2 was preparing for his first age - group trial and his uncle mapped out the journey to become an @entity11 on the back of a napkin			1
he told @entity61 to sign the napkin with the words ‘ @entity64 ’ , but @entity2 felt uncomfortable and instead went under the pseudonym ‘ @entity65 ’			2
@entity67 runs with the ball during training as @entity11 look to continue their winning streak @entity11 team - mates check out performance analysis data on a coach 's laptop @entity77 clears the ball from the lineout during a training session at @entity81 in @entity17 @entity82 makes a pass as @entity11 crank up the intensity of their training session the first major step of his career was to move north and join up with @entity1 at the @entity7 academy			1
his work - rate meant he left school with top grades , but his reaction to scoring 99.4 per cent in his maths exam was : ‘ i missed one bloody mark			0
’ that competitive nature carried through and @entity1 recalls the hunger he showed at one of his first senior training sessions			2
‘ @entity104 ( @entity105 ) , @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , @entity101 ( @entity100 ) and @entity106 came up to me at one point and said , “ listen , if he comes into another ruck and pinches another ball , then we ’re going to @entity112 ( slap ) him ”			0
@entity115 ( left ) has not been named in the squad to face @entity28 after returning from injury @entity118 has been selected to start at fly - half at the @entity29 @entity120 ( centre ) passes the ball during training following @entity11 ' wins against @entity125 and @entity32 @entity115 ( right ) is tackled by @entity67 as @entity11 seek to make it 26 @entity126 unbeaten against @entity28 ‘ i said , “ if you snot him , then i ’ll be snotting the lot of you			1
leave him alone , he ’s only a baby			0
just look after him and get there quicker than he is ”			0
he started setting standards at training because he made it real			0
he did n’t know any different			0
i had to tell him , “ just let them win a couple , will you , you ’re starting to p * * * them off ! ”			0
‘ he was n’t a natural athlete ; he had four feet and could n’t catch a cold			0
what he had was a massive capacity to learn and he always wanted to be better			0
’ captain @entity2 is tackled by teammates during the training session on thursday @entity11 players take part in the traditional haka ahead of their 24 - 16 victory over @entity32 @entity67 ( centre ) powers through @entity125 's defence during a 24 - 21 victory at @entity154 now @entity2 is the pillar of experience among the new generation of @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity118 ; a youthful trio who will all be central figures in @entity17 tomorrow night			1
@entity28 lit the touch - paper with comments that @entity11 are ‘ there to be taken ’ , but @entity1 does not think they believe their own words			1
‘ they probably feel like they have to say it , ’ he said			0
‘ sometimes we find our inner belief by talking			0
history gives you self - belief but success gives you more			0
’ that self - belief runs through the veins of @entity11 , especially those of their @entity64 .			2

@entity11 take on @entity28 in their *autumn* *international* test on saturday
@entity2 will become first player to captain his country in 100 tests
all @entity11 coach @entity1 says @entity2 is ' probably our greatest rugby player ever '
