interns usually spend their time making tea and running errands - but not the interns at @entity5			2
with the excitement of @entity10 's ' picture perfect ' test flight out of the way , the space agency 's work experience team seem to have found themselves at a loose end			1
' hey , they 're working so hard , do n't you love these @entity5 guys ? / they will take us so far the first time that @entity10 flies / you know we travelling ' to deep destinations ' fore too long , ' they lyrics say			2
@entity10 captured the world 's attention when it orbited the @entity43 twice , in an effort to test systems that could one day take humans to @entity47			1
but excitement around the @entity5 launch has since faded			2
to rekindle interest , the @entity29 tasked its interns with creating a viral video dubbed all about that @entity53			2
the resulting video is a mix of pop - style dance moves cringe - worthy lyrics and shots of the @entity29 in @entity30 , which launched the @entity10 spacecraft a week ago last week , for the first time in nearly half a century , @entity5 launched a spaceship designed to carry astronauts far beyond @entity43			1
riding atop a fountain of fire , the 24 - story - tall @entity10 spacecraft soared above the @entity66 on the 5th of december , punching through partly cloudy skies			0
the unmanned craft was then catapulted around the @entity43 twice in a 4.5 - hour journey , before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,000 km / h )			0
in the future , @entity5 hopes to use the spacecraft to send astronauts to an asteroid in the 2020s and ultimately take them to @entity47 in the 2030s			1
the lyrics , written by @entity78 , talk about how the space agency is attempting to complete project like the @entity82 mission that took humans to the @entity84 in 1969			1
' i 'm bringing rockets back / go ahead and tell the whole world that / we 're doing exploration			0
come on , board it stat / we 're ready for liftoff , ' the interns sing			0
@entity17 's single , all about that @entity19 was one of the fastest selling singles of the year , and held the number one spot longer than any other song in 2014			1
this is n't the first time @entity5 - fans have turned to music to convey their enthusiasm for space			0
in 2012 , a parody clip on @entity108 's party anthem @entity105 , space enthusiasts talked about celebrated the @entity111 mission			0
with lyrics like ' we 're better than @entity115 and we ai n't afraid to show it , ' the video became an instant hit			0
the @entity118 even tweeted : ' this fan - made video is awesome ( and i know it ) , ' adding the mission hashtag @entity123 and # wigglewigglewiggle			0
the lyrics , written by @entity78 , talk about how the space agency is attempting to complete project like the @entity82 mission which took humans to the @entity84 in 1969			1

interns parody @entity17 's number one single @entity133
it is set in @entity29 in @entity30 , which helped launch @entity10
the lyrics , written by @entity78 , talk about how @entity5 's future plans
the space agency is planning to send humans to @entity47 using @entity10 craft
