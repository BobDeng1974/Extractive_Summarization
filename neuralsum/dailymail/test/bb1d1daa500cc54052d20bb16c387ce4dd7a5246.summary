when @entity2 's wife said she wanted to get a fourth cat , it is unlikely that this is quite the addition to the household she imagined			2
because , since monday , the family have been sharing their home with arguably @entity10 ' most famous mountain lion , @entity9			1
the cougar , the other name for the species , has made his home in the crawlspace under the house in the hilly @entity20 neighborhood - and has so far resisted all attempts to get him to move out			1
ten hours later - despite animal welfare officers using a prod , and even firing tennis balls and bean bags at it - he was still refusing to move			1
' i do n't think he 's going to come out , ' @entity2 told @entity43			2
' he 's probably been living here for a while			2
' he thinks this is his den. ' but then , this level of determination will probably come as no surprise to those who know the tale of p - 22			2
it is thought the lion crossed the 405 and 101 freeways more than three years ago , as he travelled from his home in the @entity57			1
he has been living in nearby @entity58 ever since - where scientists managed to catch and tag him			1
but his fame reached new heights after @entity63 photographer @entity62 managed to capture him walking in front of the @entity66 sign in 2013			1
then , last year , the big cat survived mange and a meal of rat poison to become apparently healthy again			0
fame : @entity72 is best - known for being pictured in front of the @entity66 sign in 2013 hiding : it is thought the lion crossed two freeways to get to his home in @entity58 , but it is not known how long he has been living in the crawl space in the @entity20 hills beanbags : the animal rescue workers have even resorted to using beanbags to move the lion however , all this is nothing to the furore surrounding his latest move			1
the @entity89 reports a scene worthy of any film star - with news vans filling the street , helicopters flying overhead and even a live news feed on a local channel reporting the latest			0
however , they were not rewarded for their patience , and state wildlife officials cleared most media and gawkers away from the area as night fell			0
they continued with their attempts to dislodge @entity72 , starting with poking him gently with a long prod , but that did little â€” other than temporarily lose the pricey @entity109 camera they 'd attached to the end of it that fell off			1
they then attempted to fire a tennis ball cannon into the crawl space with hopes that at least the noise and commotion would scare him out , a tactic that often works with coyotes			0
next , they fired small bean bags , the same kind police sometimes use for human crowd control , toward the cat			0
live feed : the incident has created quite a furore - with people watching it unfold live on television ( pictured ) all of the tactics , shown live on streaming video , drew mild reactions from p - 22 , but none came close to drawing him out or even getting him to significantly move			0
wildlife officials said late monday night that their next move would be to just wait			0
' we 're going to let him settle , we 're going to let everything calm down , we 're going to be really still and give him time to get out of there , ' said @entity144 of the @entity145			0
@entity2 said he and his wife have three ordinary house cats and had thought about adding to their numbers			2
' my wife wanted a fourth one , ' he said , ' but not this way			0
