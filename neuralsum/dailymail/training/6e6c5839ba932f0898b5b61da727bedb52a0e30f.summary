@entity10 was dragged away from the river and into the jungle where she was robbed			1
the 28 - year - old accountant was then abandoned in the middle of a remote nature reserve – teeming with alligators and anacondas – when her panicked kidnappers realised the military was closing in on them			1
they were said to be in ‘ good condition ’ last night despite their terrifying ordeal in the steamingly hot rainforest			1
their nightmare began on friday afternoon as they travelled towards @entity49 ’s @entity48 with three other foreign tourists and two local guides			2
the nature reserve – made up of rivers , lagoons and forest covering 2,000 square miles – is home to more than 500 different species of birds , pink freshwater dolphins , 250 species of fish , including piranha , and alligators			2

the kidnappers – whom locals say have links to a notorious @entity36 drug - running gang – robbed the tourists of their cameras and phones before taking miss @entity10 , from @entity84 in @entity85 , and @entity86 miss @entity34 , 32 , at gunpoint and escaping into the forest			1
the women were abandoned later that evening after their kidnappers realised they were being tracked			2
the traumatised pair were then forced to spent the night alone before their cries for help were heard by a passing farmer			2
a source said that the women were also being tracked by the military after one kidnapper used a mobile phone , allowing his whereabouts to be traced			2

it is because of the social problems and the poverty			0
