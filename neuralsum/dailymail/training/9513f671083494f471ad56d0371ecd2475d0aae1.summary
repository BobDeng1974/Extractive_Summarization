it was the ninth @entity86 mountaineering expedition to attempt the first ascent of @entity4 , and the first confirmed to succeed			0
the @entity86 felt under particular pressure , as the @entity183 had received permission to mount an expedition in 1954 , and the @entity186 another in 1955 , meaning the @entity86 would not have another chance at @entity4 until 1956 or later			0

he added that having @entity130 and @entity131 at the occasion was particularly special			0

' dr @entity149 said he was proud to have worked on the book with mr @entity146 , adding : ' a book is a book , it 's not climbing @entity4 but it was massively emotional			0
