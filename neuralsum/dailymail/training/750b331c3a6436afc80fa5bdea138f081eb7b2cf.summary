policing minister @entity0 said drug driving was a ' deadly menace ' drugged - up drivers face a major police crack down after ministers signed off the first mobile - testing kit for use by officers			1
the device known as @entity10 is the first portable tester that can detect the presence of cannabis and cocaine - two of the most common substances used by drug drivers - by analysing a small quantity of saliva			1
results are indicated by the appearance of lines on the device - similar to a pregnancy test - within eight minutes			1
policing minister @entity0 , who announced the device 's approval at a road policing conference , said : ‘ drug drivers are a deadly menace and must be stopped			1
‘ it has long been my ambition as @entity30 and now as minister for policing to take further action on drug driving			0
‘ those who get behind the wheel while under the influence of drugs not only put their own lives at risk , but also those of innocent pedestrians , motorists and their passengers			0
’ following a positive reading , the police will take the individual to the police station for a blood sample , which will be used in any subsequent prosecution			0
it is estimated as many as 200 people a year are killed by drivers impaired by drugs			2
@entity53 will be used to enforce the existing offence of driving whilst impaired as well as a new drug driving offence set to come into force in march			0
the penalty under the new offence will be 12 months disqualification , a fine up to £ 5,000 and up to six months in prison or both			0
the new law sets limits for eight illegal drugs - cannabis , cocaine , ecstasy and ketamine , heroin , lysergic acid diethylamide , methylamphetamine and @entity75 - at very low levels			1
the police will be able to test drivers for drug use in the same way they can catch boozed - up motorists with police issue breathalysers @entity84 president @entity83 said : ‘ we have known for a long time that drug - driving kills around 200 people every year on @entity90 roads			2
‘ to tackle this needless waste of life , the police need to be able to test drivers accurately for drugs and we need tough legislation in place to prosecute those who are found to be drug - driving			1
‘ the approval of drug - testing devices is certainly a move to be welcomed			0
' any driver who has taken the risk of drug - driving in the past should take this as their final warning that drug - drivers will not be tolerated on our roads			2

cannabis and cocaine are among the top *narcotics* used by drug drivers
new ' @entity10 ' device can detect the drugs through a driver 's saliva
results are indicated by lines on the device within eight minutes
