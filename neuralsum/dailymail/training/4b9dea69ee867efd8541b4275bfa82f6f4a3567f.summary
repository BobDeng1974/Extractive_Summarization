by @entity0 published : 20:13 est , 15 december 2013 updated : 04:44 est , 16 december 2013 distinguished judge : @entity2 has warned of the peril of legalising assisted suicide one of the country ’s most distinguished judges has warned of the peril of legalising assisted suicide			1
allowing the terminally ill to be killed would cross ‘ a line in the sand ’ towards euthanasia , according to @entity2			1
‘ the law rests on the principle that we do not involve ourselves in deliberately bringing about the deaths of others , ’ she said yesterday			2
‘ once we start making exceptions based on arbitrary criteria like terminal illness , that frontier becomes just a line in the sand , easily crossed and hard to defend			0
’ @entity2 , an appeal judge who headed the family court system until her retirement , intervened in the euthanasia argument on the eve of a landmark @entity25 case			1
nine judges will sit in a test case , which decides whether the assisted suicide law should be changed			1
the @entity25 hearing , which will consider appeals on behalf of two men who want doctors to be able to help them die , coincides with a new attempt by right - to - die campaigner @entity35 to persuade peers to vote for a law to allow doctors to help terminally ill patients to die			1
@entity2 , 80 , said : ‘ we are seeing a predictable upsurge in the activities of the assisted dying lobby in the run - up to the @entity25 ’s hearing next week			1
‘ assisting suicide is against the criminal law , and with good reason			1
the prohibition is there to protect vulnerable people			0
yet some are suggesting that this process should be put into reverse for terminally ill people and that doctors should be licensed to facilitate their suicide			2
’ case : the @entity25 will hear appeals on behalf of the late @entity60 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) @entity2 , who is the former president of the @entity62 , accused right - to - die campaigners of bending debate on the issue by twisting the language			1
‘ campaigners throw up their hands at the word suicide , ’ she said			2
‘ giving lethal drugs to someone who is terminally ill is n’t assisting suicide , they say , but assisting dying			0
‘ similarly , @entity35 ’s @entity77 , now before the @entity76 , describes the lethal drugs that it wants doctors to be able to supply to terminally ill patients as “ medicines ”			0
such euphemisms may make the idea of changing the law more palatable , but they obstruct reasoned debate			2
’ she said an assisted suicide licensing system with ‘ doubtful safeguards ’ would suit a few people determined to end their own lives			1
however , she added : ‘ @entity85 has to make laws to protect all of us , especially the most vulnerable			0
‘ it is hard to imagine any group of people more vulnerable than those who are dying			0
they need our support and protection , not our help to commit suicide			0
’ ' assisting suicide is against the criminal law , and with good reason			2
the prohibition is there to protect vulnerable people ' @entity2 once assisted suicide was legalised , she said , the practice would spread beyond the set limits			1
‘ anyone who doubts this should read the report of @entity35 ’s self - styled “ commission on assisted dying ” , and its conclusion that legalising assisted suicide for people with severe physical impairments was not acceptable “ at this point in time ” , ’ @entity2 wrote in the @entity103			1
under the @entity114 , anyone who helps a suicide is guilty of a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail			0
the @entity25 will hear appeals on behalf of @entity60 and @entity61			2
mr @entity60 , who had locked - in syndrome following a stroke , died in august 2012 after losing his @entity62 case for the right to be helped to die			0
his widow @entity125 has been allowed to pursue the case			0
mr @entity61 , a former builder and a father - of - two , has been almost totally paralysed since a car crash in 1990			0
he wants a doctor to be allowed to help him die .			0
