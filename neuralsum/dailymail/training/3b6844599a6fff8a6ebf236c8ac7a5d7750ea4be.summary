by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 13:38 est , 7 january 2014 @entity2 described his career and retirement from @entity5 by video link as testimony began on tuesday in a hearing into whether he can get back the retirement benefits he lost after being convicted of child molestation			1
the proceeding at the headquarters of the @entity13 in @entity14 involves the pension he earned while working for decades as a @entity5 assistant football coach			1
from a prison in southwestern @entity18 , @entity2 began by describing his career at @entity5 and talks with school administrators about a possible continuing role with the university around the time of his 1999 retirement			1
@entity2 said he decided to retire in 1999 because of an early retirement incentive that would boost his pension			2
' it was an opportunity financially to be in a more secure position by retiring at that time , ' @entity2 testified			0
he lost a $ 4,900 - a - month pension in october 2012 , the day he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for 45 counts of child sexual abuse			1
the decision also precluded @entity46 from collecting benefits			0
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) ruled that his convictions for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent assault fell under @entity18 's @entity52			2
@entity2 had opted to participate in the state - sponsored retirement system while at @entity5 , which is a ' state - related ' university , but he was not a state employee			1
at the heart of the dispute is whether @entity2 's ties to the university after his retirement , including some payments , made him a ' de facto ' @entity5 employee while committing the crimes in question			1
his lawyer has argued he was not and that his employment contract was not renewed after the forfeiture law took effect in 1978 so its terms do not apply to him			0
@entity2 attorney @entity71 has said @entity5 made only six payments to @entity2 between 2000 and 2008 , and three of them involved travel costs			2
the other three were speaking fees of $ 100 , $ 300 and $ 1,500			0
former @entity5 assistant football coach @entity2 , walks with his wife @entity34 into court in 2012			1
she attended the hearing over his pension benefits today in a december 9 filing , @entity71 also argued that @entity2 did not fit the definition of ' school employee ' under the forfeiture law			2
' @entity82 reported case in the history of @entity18 jurisprudence has ever applied a '' de facto '' employee analysis to deny someone his retirement earnings , and @entity13 should not bow to political pressure and ' mob rule ' to deny claimant his retirement earnings , ' @entity71 wrote			0
in recent weeks , there was a dispute over the @entity13 witness list , which included two former @entity5 administrators facing allegations of a criminal cover - up about @entity2 , former athletic director @entity99 and former vice president @entity100			1
a @entity13 lawyer said at the start of the hearing that both men asserted their fifth amendment rights not to testify			0
there is currently no trial date set for @entity99 and @entity108 , who are being prosecuted in the @entity110 , about two blocks from the @entity13 headquarters			0
it likely will be several months before the hearing examiner , @entity114 , produces his written recommendation to the retirement system board			0
if the board rules against @entity2 , he may appeal to @entity118 .			0
