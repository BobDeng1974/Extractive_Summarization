by @entity0 if you have ever travelled with @entity3 chances are that you have had a cause to grumble			2
but while most disgruntled passengers only daydream about the ways they might grab the attention of the airline 's customer service team , or its notorious boss @entity10 , one rather angry , and very funny , newlywed from @entity11 is using social media to wreak his revenge			1
this week a brilliantly angry complaint went viral after customer @entity16 posted an open letter to the budget airline via his @entity20 page			1
is all @entity22 good pr ? a complaint to @entity3 posted on customer @entity16 's @entity20 page has received more than 60,000 shares @entity16 and his new wife had been on their way to a second wedding reception in @entity30 when motorway traffic and ' incompetent ' @entity3 staff conspired to thwart their travel plans			1
as @entity16 explains in his several hundred word post : ' we went straight to the @entity3 assistant and explained our plight			1
she said we were still within the time and all would be fine but we had to make the attendant at check in aware and he would assist from there			0
' we approached the attendant as instructed and explained			0
unfortunately , in the main part , due to him being a child , and forgetting to bring his mother to work , he heard only half of the words before his brain fell apart like a wet cake			0
@entity3 chief executive @entity10 recently promised that the airline had ' reinvented ' itself to become more customer - focused ' he led us to the line for closing gates , advised we should wait and all would be ok			1
we stood patiently in the line for 20 minutes			0
' we got to the front of the line and the lady , who we shall from this point refer to a @entity58 , explained that she had literally just that second closed the flight and we had missed it			0
' we complained that we had done as instructed and she said it was the child ’s fault because he should have advised her that we were trying to board a closing flight and that because he had n’t told her it was therefore our fault we had missed the plane			0
' in a series of withering put - downs the groom introduces '' @entity58 's ' other colleagues as ' @entity70 ' and ' @entity71 ' and goes on to explain in detail how all four characters spectacularly failed to live up to the new improved customer service levels that @entity3 have recently claimed to implement			1
@entity16 continues : ' @entity71 had clearly listened hard at @entity76 school as he managed to take two perfectly calm and sane adults and in a matter of seconds reduce them to angry people considering violence			1
tweet revenge : some of the thousands of @entity83 messages in support of @entity16 's complaint " check in opens 3 hours before the flight " he barked repeatedly as if it was the answer to every question in life			2
we tried to ask @entity71 direct questions about why it was necessary for us to miss the flight because the @entity94 had forgotten to do his job , and @entity58 had forgotten to do hers			2
‘ why is this our fault , and why should we miss the flight because @entity3 staff have admitted they made errors ?			1
‘ check in opens three hours before the flight ’ ‘ do you acknowledge we have just cause for complaint as we tried to do the right thing and the only reason we are not on the plane is because of communication failures with @entity108 ? ’ ‘ check in opens three hours before the flight ’ ‘ what colour are my trousers ? ’ ‘ check in opens three hours before the flight ’ ‘ do you think economic sanctions on @entity115 will diffuse the escalating situation in @entity117 ? ’ ‘ check in opens three hours before the flight ’ ‘ were @entity119 right to fire @entity120 ? ’ ‘ check in opens three hours before the flight ’ ‘ my tinkle is hurting , could you take a look if i promise not to tell anyone ? ’ ‘ check in opens three hours before the flight			0
" ' under fire : the complaint about the budget airline has gone viral on @entity20 the open letter was posted on @entity20 on april 24 and within days had garnered thousands of ' shares ' on the social networking site			1
on april 26 @entity16 posted a @entity20 status update saying : ' staggered , over 6000 shares now for my @entity3 story			1
@entity139 , flattered and really pleased i have made some people laugh			0
thank you for all the emails and messages to show support and to say it made you laugh , really appreciate it			0
' one week on and the post has been shared over 60,000 times and is a hot topic on @entity83 as @entity16 awaits a response from the airline			1
@entity16 estimates that the experience has cost him £ 220 for new flights , £ 79 for a hotel , £ 50 for taxis to and from the airport and £ 35 for ' the world 's most expensive sandwich ' plus stress , inconvenience and an angry wife			0
he summarised his customer services experience by saying : ' so , thank you @entity3 for a comfortable and enjoyable experience			2
i have watched a program called the news so i fully expect this to land on the desk of the customer services team underneath the empty bottles and sandwich wrappers that you also file there			0
' you treated us badly , you cost us money and made us miss our wedding reception through a display of incompetence i have not seen since @entity179 was allowed to have money and a cheque book			0
' @entity182 , @entity183 at @entity3 told @entity184 : ' we are aware of mr @entity16 ’s complaint and have contacted him directly to address these issues			2
' read the full complaint on @entity16 's @entity20 here .			2
