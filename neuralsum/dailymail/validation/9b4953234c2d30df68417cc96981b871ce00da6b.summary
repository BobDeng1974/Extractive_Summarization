pictured with a fish in its mouth , this bear was seen thrashing around in an effort to keep the catch under control wildlife photographer , @entity10 , 52 , spent days photographing the bears hunting at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity2 @entity19 customer : the cub wrestles with the huge fish as a parent stands in the river nearby amusingly , the bear 's sibling was also seen looking on in awe as the cub wrestled its meal into submission			1
but although the feisty fish was nearly equal in size to the little cub , the youngster managed to win the battle to bag himself a hearty lunch			2
after finding a secluded spot near the river , the cub then tried to tuck into its supper in peace but it was n't long before its brother wondered over to see the impressive catch for himself			2

amusingly , the bear 's sibling was also seen looking on in awe as the cub wrestled its meal into submission trying to fin - ish the job : the tiny bear grapples with the fish , which puts up a brave fight as it stands in the shallow water @entity10 said ' the lakes and rivers here are full of salmon and that 's why the bears look so well , they do n't even sleep in the winter until late january because they have plenty to eat ' fight on a grand scale : the bear cub just ca n't seem to get a grip on its prey and looks up anxiously for support ' i was not really far from them , probably no more than 50 metres and after a few days they get used to your presence and pay you little attention			1
' the lakes and rivers here are full of salmon and that 's why the bears look so well , they do n't even sleep in the winter until late january because they have plenty to eat			2
' but considering the fact that the lake is full of fish , i have never seen such a small bear tackle such a big fish			0
it was pretty hilarious to watch him trying to cope with a fish as big as this one			0
' i even remember laughing out loud when i saw this through my viewfinder			0
' but the bear is a strong animal , even the cubs , and it finally managed to win the fight			0
' looking at the pictures you can see it was n't just me that thought the fish was too much handle , it looks like his sibling had the same idea			0
