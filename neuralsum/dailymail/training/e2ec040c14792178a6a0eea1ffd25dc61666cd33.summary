@entity1 's long - awaited emergence as a contributing member of the @entity4 squad was confirmed by the @entity6 's goal in the @entity7 at @entity8 on monday night			1
@entity1 's increasing importance to @entity4 , however , perhaps says as much about the learning curve being experienced by his manager @entity11 in @entity13 football than it does about his own improvement			1
@entity15 arrived at @entity4 last summer intent on playing a certain style of football			1
almost immediately he instructed @entity4 chief executive @entity19 to try to sell @entity1 , saying privately that he was ' not a @entity4 player '			1
@entity1 celebrates scoring their second goal for @entity4 against @entity8 the @entity6 midfielder scored from close range after his initial header was saved @entity1 came off the bench to rescue @entity4 as they booked their place in the quarter final had a foot injury not got in the way of a subsequent loan move to @entity32 last august , @entity1 would no longer be at @entity33			1
@entity15 , however , has realised in recent weeks just how useful the @entity6 can be when he needs to change his team 's style of play			2
at @entity39 in the @entity40 recently , @entity1 's introduction as a substitute earned @entity4 a goal and a point			1
on monday in @entity43 , @entity1 's switch to the focal point of a hastily restructured 4 - 4 - 2 formation earned him what was effectively the winning goal			2
' i have used @entity1 a lot of times already - more than ever and he scores more than ever , ' @entity15 said			2
' he ( @entity1 ) is a player that when we can not beat the pressure with quality , we can always beat the pressure [ another way ]			2
' now i have played him for the first time in his [ preferred ] position			0
' those who remember @entity1 at his best – for @entity60 and for @entity6 – will recall him using his height and physical presence high up the field			2
he was , during his time under @entity65 at @entity66 , a talented and effective attacking outlet			2
@entity1 looked to be on his way out of @entity33 in the summer when @entity11 came in a foot injury in the summer prevented @entity1 from moving to @entity32 on loan @entity65 once described @entity1 as having the best chest trap in world football			1
it was a peculiar statement and sounded almost as though the 27 – year - old was being damned with faint praise			0
more interestingly , it was a talent that @entity65 seemed to negate after he brought @entity1 to @entity4 by trying to turn him in to a holding midfield player			1
it was a plan that did n't work and it is from positions in the final third of the field that @entity1 is now beginning to exert an influence once again			0
' the manager is the boss but of course i like that , ' said @entity1 yesterday when asked about a role up front			0
' i can score goals from there so i am happy			0
@entity92 started the game against @entity8 - but was taken off in the second half ' we changed the game when the manager switched things and i went forward			0
' @entity15 certainly did n't envisage finding a place for @entity1 in the forward line when he replaced @entity65 last year			1
the @entity103 coach understandably felt that @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity92 would provide him with enough options in those positions			0
@entity15 did n't think there was room in his midfield for @entity1 either but , as time has passed , the @entity4 manager has realised that @entity13 football – and particularly the @entity40 – asks so many different questions and requires so many different answers that players like @entity1 can become useful			1
@entity15 will talk all day about his love of attractive football but he is , above all , a pragmatist and always has been			0
@entity65 signed @entity1 from @entity60 and described the player as having the best chest trap in football this is the man who shunted the great @entity128 striker @entity127 out to the wing during his years at @entity130 , the man who used @entity132 is five different positions in one game – including right - back and centre forward – during a @entity138 knockout game last summer			1
currently the @entity4 manager has players like @entity92 and @entity140 who are – by their own standards – failing to do their jobs			0
@entity92 was wretched against @entity8 and , with @entity140 expected to be fit for the game at @entity144 this weekend , one wonders when we will see the @entity146 in the starting line - up again			0
it is , therefore , at times like this that players like @entity1 start to become rather useful indeed			0
for reasons that are not entirely his fault , @entity4 's big @entity6 will forever be associated with @entity65 ' troubled tenure at @entity33			1
he will be known as the big money signing who bombed			0
footballers are allowed more than one life at a club , though , more than one chance			0
@entity1 will never be an iconic @entity4 footballer but his contributions are becoming frequent enough to have already proved a few people wrong , including his own manager .			2

@entity11 was keen to sell @entity1 in the summer
@entity1 came off the bench against @entity8 to help @entity4 win
the midfielder has become an important member of @entity15 's squad
@entity1 : i felt like a *scapegoat* last *season* under @entity65
