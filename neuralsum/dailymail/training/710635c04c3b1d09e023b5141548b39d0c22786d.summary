by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 09:08 est , 20 april 2012 with a name like @entity1 and a song called @entity5 , you might already have guessed they think highly of themselves			2
but two wannabe pop princesses could well find themselves propelled into a storm of @entity10 proportions after releasing a music video bemoaning all the downsides of being beautiful			1
in it , the teenagers , aka @entity14 and @entity15 , gesture flirtatiously in the back of a limousine while recounting all the obstacles they encounter with men and other girls because of their looks			2
scroll down for the music video ' we 're hot ! ' : pop duo @entity1 in their music video hot problems in which they lament the negatives of being pretty controversial : the girls giggle and gesture flirtatiously at the camera			1
the song has attracted more than 60,000 ' dislikes ' on @entity33 in just five days lamenting ( out of tune ) over a rather dodgy electro - pop backing track , they proclaim : ' hot girls we have problems , too			1
we 're just like you , except we 're hot			2
' other lines include : ' please do n't get me wrong			2
i know i 'm hot , but textbook perfection really takes a lot			0
' @entity46 guys calls my phone and girls call names ... but i ca n't be tamed			0
' the song is at serious risk of splitting opinion as ferociously as mrs @entity10 did when she claimed in a @entity54 article earlier this month that women loathed her for being too attractive			0
she said : ' there are downsides to being pretty â€” the main one being that other women hate me for no other reason than my lovely looks			0
' ' downsides to being pretty ' : @entity1 risk splitting opinion as journalist @entity10 ( above ) did when she wrote how women hated her because of her ' lovely looks ' her initial story attracted 1.6million hits - and thousands of vitriolic insults - on @entity71 , rising to 2.7million when you include her follow - up article defending her stance			1
in a similar brewing storm , the ' @entity5 ' video has been watched more than a million times on @entity33 , but has received more than 60,000 ' dislikes ' compared to just 4,800 ' likes '			1
one poster pleaded : ' please shoot my ears off			0
' as if anticipating the resultant backlash , the production company , @entity83 , made sure to distance itself from the video			1
' @entity83 did not create any of the audio or lyrics for this video , ' it stated in the description			1
' we produced the video as a favor			1
' from an ' artistic ' point of view , many are also making derogatory comparisons to @entity98 's widely slated flop friday which was dubbed possibly the ' worst video of all time ' last year			1
worst - ever ? @entity1 's video is already attracting derogatory comparisons to @entity98 's friday ( above ) which was heavily slammed last year it is not entirely clear whether the high school pair , who have not revealed their surnames , are merely being tongue in cheek , but they have said they created the video ' just for fun '			2
' it was just have something we could share with our friends , ' @entity14 said in an interview with @entity119			0
' we enjoy writing funny lyrics and songs and we decided that we really liked this one			0
i think that hopefully there could be a future with it			0
' @entity15 added : ' i do n't think we 're going to be the next @entity127 , but we do really like writing songs and coming up with lyrics			0
who knows ? maybe we 'll get into that			0

@entity134 ' video gets a million @entity33 hits
but gets 60,000 ' dislikes ' and only *5,000* ' likes '
