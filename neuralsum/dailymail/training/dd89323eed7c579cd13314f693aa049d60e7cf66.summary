by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:26 est , 10 february 2014 @entity3 : 10:59 est , 10 february 2014 wearing a pork pie hat and riding in a pushchair along the tarmac of a @entity10 airport , @entity4 , the ' miracle survivor of the @entity5 ' began the long journey home today			1
and while his flight home was to take more than 24 hours , it is considerably shorter than the almost 14 months he spent drifting across the world 's largest ocean			2
accompanied by a burly @entity18 diplomat , 37 - year - old @entity4 was given a window seat at the very front of the economy section , where he slumped down in a deliberate attempt to be photographed by other passengers who learned of his fame			2
precious cargo : @entity4 is wheeled onto the @entity28 flight home in the early hours of this morning real life castaway @entity29 has crossed the @entity5 again - but this time in a plane			1
he is pictured in the airport lounge , ready to leave for home the fisherman washed ashore late last month in the @entity10 after spending more than a year drifting across the ocean living on what he could catch mr @entity4 's arrival time at @entity40 's @entity39 had been kept secret			1
at the last moment , however , the republic 's president @entity41 chose to give a brief photo opportunity in the airport 's vip lounge for the evening meal on the four and a half hour flight from the @entity10 to @entity48 he was given a choice of grilled chicken and vegetables or lasagne and vegetables			1
he chose lasagne - possibly because it was the closest to his favourite tortilla , the central @entity56 meal that he cried out for when he first struck land nearly two weeks ago			2
that was followed by fruit salad , cookies from the island nation of @entity62 , and accompanied by a soft drink and water			2
as the @entity28 jet soared across the @entity5 , @entity4 did not bother looking out of the window at the ocean he had so painfully crossed in his open boat - because it was dark there was nothing to see			2
so he dozed most of the way and airline staff ensured he was not bothered by passengers curious to learn more about his extraordinary adventure			0
but he told a passenger as the flight landed that he had enjoyed his first ' ride ' in an aeroplane			0
his immediate plans on landing in @entity48 were not known but he has told his minders in the @entity10 that he is looking forward to once again greeting the family he has not seen for 15 years since he fled @entity84 after a brutal bar - room dispute			1
but now the 37 - year - old @entity18 , who looks remarkably healthier than the bloated and bedraggled figure who hit headlines two weeks ago , is heading back to his family , who have not seen him for 15 years after he fled to @entity91 following a brutal bar - room brawl it was claimed that before moving to @entity91 , mr @entity4 belonged to a guerrilla army in his native @entity84 , where he was trained in jungle warfare doctors in the @entity10 said before he left for the flight that he had been given the all clear to fly , although he was still having trouble walking , which was why he required a wheel chair to be taken to the aircraft at @entity39			1
the fisherman washed ashore late last month in the @entity10 after spending more than a year drifting across the ocean living on what he could catch			1
he reportedly asked the @entity91 deputy head of mission in @entity40 , the @entity10 capital : ' what do i do when i get on the plane ? what happens ? ' he was told : ' you do n't do anything but sit there and people come along and bring you food and drink			1
' ' that sounds good , ' he said with a grin			0
mr @entity4 's arrival time at @entity40 's @entity39 had been kept secret			0
at the last moment , however , the republic 's president @entity41 chose to give a brief photo opportunity in the airport 's vip lounge			0
he said : ' @entity4 is welcome back here any time			1
we are very proud that we were able to help him			0
" ' when asked if the he believes @entity4 's story , president @entity41 said : ' i would like to give him the benefit of the doubt , but i have not seen him , but also i have no reason to doubt him			0
' this is a mind - boggling story of surviving for 13 months			0
' initially mr @entity4 was to fly out on friday , but eventually he left on monday evening , headed for @entity48			0
his flights home will see him fly from @entity48 to either @entity132 or @entity133 and from whichever one to @entity134 , capital of @entity84			0
new look : looking clean shaven @entity4 spoke briefly in a low voice at a press conference last week , thanking the government and his friends for their help boat : willing @entity143 also released a photo of police checking the 7 - meter fishing boat of @entity29 after it was pulled onto the shore following his rescue , on @entity10 weak : @entity29 sits on a couch in @entity40 in the @entity10 last monday , after he was rescued from being washed ashore on the tiny atoll of @entity151 in the @entity5 having told doctors that he had kept himself alive as he drifted across the @entity5 for 14 months by eating raw fish , the flesh of sea birds and turtles and drinking their blood and his own urine , there was concern about his kidneys and liver			1
while he looked in remarkably good health and overall condition when seen on the atoll of @entity151 after coming ashore for the first time since he had set out on an ill - fated fishing expedition , his health deteriorated when he was brought to @entity40			2
father : a family picture of castaway @entity29 holding his daughter @entity171 such was the concern of doctors that a day after he was released from hospital and taken to a lagoon - side hotel to relax he was returned to hospital and placed on a rehydration drip			1
then he was taken back to the hotel as arrangements were made to fly him home to his family for what will be a tearful reunion			1
a police guard was placed outside his room to prevent journalists talking to him and every step was taken to ensure that details of his return journey did not leak out			0
an @entity18 diplomat who flew from @entity190 brought with him a special passport - making kit , allowing him to prepare an emergency passport for @entity4 so he could pass through @entity56 airports on the way home			0
he also needed the document to enter his country of birth .			0

@entity29 washed ashore last month in @entity10
he is now heading back to family in @entity91 who he has not seen for 15 years
@entity204 has never been on a plane before and is believed to be *nervous*
