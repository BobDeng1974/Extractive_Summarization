a clever child from a loving middle class home , @entity0 was the most unlikely perpetrator of a crime that would shock @entity5			1
as the 16 - year - old was sentenced to life in prison after becoming the first pupil to kill a teacher in a @entity5 classroom , friends said they were stunned by his senseless stabbing of his teacher @entity14			1
to the teacher in charge of his year he was ‘ a delightful pupil who always gave his best ’			1
fellow pupils at @entity20 said he was a just a ‘ typical lad ’ who rarely misbehaved			2
‘ but he was really quiet and kept himself to himself			2
he had his friends , but he was n’t with them all the time			2
‘ you can look at someone and say “ i do n’t think they could do anything like that ”			2
i did n’t think that in a school like @entity20 such a thing could happen			2
’ another unnamed student said : ‘ he was like any other lad my age ; he was n’t a naughty kid			2
he was a typical , nice lad			2
it seems surreal how it ’s changed			2
’ @entity0 was no youth from a sink estate left to his own devices by a dysfunctional family			1
his mother @entity46 , 48 , is a human resources manager , who was said to be devoted to the teenager and his 19 - year - old brother @entity48 , who is in a rock band			1
stable life : far from being having an unhappy upbringing , @entity0 , depicted in a court sketch , comes from a middleclass background and his parents have been described as loving and supportive their father @entity55 is a 50 - year - old council executive who lives with his partner and their young child in an upmarket village near @entity26			1
although his parents divorced a decade ago , @entity0 seemed to enjoy a happy home life			1
the life sentence handed down to the schoolboy who murdered a teacher was today condemned as too harsh by youth justice campaigners			1
former magistrate @entity66 , who chairs the @entity67 for @entity69 umbrella group of charities and campaign groups , said the sentence was too long			2
she told the @entity74 4 today programme : ‘ we are out of line with the whole of western @entity78			2
there are no other countries within @entity78 which give children - and this boy is seen as a child under the @entity84 and is in the youth justice system - who would give children a life sentence			1
’ ms @entity66 accepted that the sentence had to serve as a punishment , but said there was ‘ no evidence ’ for the 20 - year minimum tariff			1
‘ punishment is also incredibly important , particularly for the victims and families , but the fact is , how many years do we need for punishment ? we have given him a sentence which is more than his own lifetime , ’ she said			0
‘ he was 15 when he did this crime and we would say that you do n't need that long to punish			0
what is crucial is that when he is released he is assessed as no longer being of danger to himself and others and thus we would all be safer			0
' but there is no evidence that that takes 20 years and we 've looked and we think that this is the longest sentence given to a child in at least 10 years			0
i 'm not going to tell you exactly what the right sentence would have been , but 20 years and a life sentence is too long			1
’ @entity118 , prosecuting , said there was nothing to indicate to the boy ’s parents or teachers that he was capable of homicidal violence			2
he added that @entity125 and mrs @entity126 are ‘ decent and responsible parents ’ who have co- operated fully with the police			2
mr @entity131 said @entity125 and mrs @entity126 were ‘ responsible and caring parents and his family life was marked by love and support ’			1
@entity0 had never been in any trouble with the police and was one of the brightest students at @entity139 , passing five gcse exams a year early			1
he was regarded as ‘ amicable , enthusiastic and conscientious ’ at school , with a 100 per cent attendance record			0
in the four years before the killing , five incidents of misbehaviour were recorded – two minor			0
significantly , the final three took place two months before the murder and concerned his hatred of mrs @entity14 and dislike of @entity153 lessons			1
but closer inspection of @entity0 ’s internet use revealed a different side to his apparently respectable image			1
as one pupil said : ‘ the @entity159 was the first thing you saw on his [ @entity163 ] page			0
‘ that corrected everyone ’s opinion			0
[ i thought ] what the hell has happened , something has definitely gone wrong			0
’ friends had begun to regard him as a ‘ loner and weirdo ’ and ‘ disturbing ’ aspects of his personality became apparent			0
he spoke openly about murdering his teacher , messaging a friend on @entity163 about brutally killing her and spending the rest of his life in jail			1
he had numerous images of knives on his mobile phone			0
he also had a keen interest in ultra-violent video games , including @entity185 , in which players hack zombies to pieces			0
players devour the souls of their fallen enemies to the sound of cries of agony			0
disturbing images include a character made up of hundreds of human corpses			0
it was voted one of the ten @entity200 of 2014			0
one pupil recalled @entity0 saying disgusting things at a party			1
he said : ‘ he was saying twisted stuff like “ imagine jumping on a pregnant woman and seeing the baby come out ” , and saying horrible stuff about cancer and stuff like that			0
loss : @entity14 's family , husband @entity210 and daughters @entity212 and @entity213 , stand outside @entity214 as a statement is read after the sentencing ‘ he was just saying it in conversation			1
he thought it was normal but it ’s not			0
he was n’t normal in the head			0
’ but for a long time @entity0 had been able to hide his ‘ anger ’ from others by maintaining an appearance of normality			1
from game to real life : @entity229 's @entity163 photograph shows him wearing a gamer tshirt the teenager later confessed to a psychiatrist that the killing had been on his mind for three years , and one expert said he had engaged in a ‘ considerable amount of fantasy ’ about killing mrs @entity14			1
psychiatrists decided he suffered from a personality disorder with psychopathic tendencies			0
it was of course too late , but the danger this previously anonymous teenager poses has now been revealed to all			0
@entity247 , a forensic psychiatrist , said @entity0 ‘ presents a risk of serious harm to the public and that this risk is present for the foreseeable future ’			1
mr @entity118 told @entity214 : ‘ one of the most disturbing aspects of an extremely disturbing case is that [ @entity0 ] not only lacks remorse but is proud of what he did in killing mrs @entity14			1
’ the @entity260 said @entity0 told a psychiatrist : ‘ i was n’t in shock , i was happy			1
i had a sense of pride			0
’ he added that @entity0 ’s parents were ‘ at a loss ’ to understand how their son could have committed such a crime			1
@entity267 of any blame by both police and the judge , @entity125 and mrs @entity126 sat behind their son in the court room dock as details of his chilling lack of remorse were revealed			0
@entity275 , who worked with mrs @entity126 at a catalogue publisher , said : ‘ it is awful for the family of the woman who has been killed but it is also traumatic for the family of the boy			0
mothers blame themselves but she ca n’t … it is just terrible			0
but really she is a nice person and a very caring mother			0
