@entity1 , 31 , exploited the trust of the vulnerable pensioners she cared for as she repeatedly helped herself to their cash - because she found it ' easy ' to rob them			1
during her thieving spree , @entity1 tried to gain the sympathy of her elderly clients by inventing a daughter and saying she was saving up money to visit her			1
but she was unmasked as a fraud after police found out used the stolen money to purchase a luxury holiday in @entity9 with a luxury stopover in @entity24 , @entity25 where it is believed she saw @entity28			1

she now faces a @entity64 hearing			0
after the case detective constable @entity65 of @entity45 said : ' this was a particularly difficult investigation as @entity1 deliberately targeted her victims by choosing the most vulnerable in our society , knowing that her victims would be unaware , too afraid , or too confused to report when money went missing			2
' she was a callous , heartless individual who has shown no remorse at all and only admitted to the thefts when faced with irrefutable evidence			0
' when later interviewed by police and asked why she had chosen to steal from this particularly vulnerable patient , @entity1 said ‘ because it was easy '			1
' she manipulated and deceived her employers and colleagues as well as those she was paid to care for			0
' she began a web of lies to gain the sympathy and trust of her elderly clients , telling them she was saving to fly back to @entity9 to see her young daughter - the investigation proved that this daughter does not exist			1
' all of the elderly victims we identified live with very few luxuries and do not have the means to replace the stolen money			1
' as @entity1 has undermined their ability to manage their own finances , she has taken from them the little independence they had left			2
' police , along with partner agencies , are dedicated to protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities			0
' we will do everything we can to keep them safe and will pursue those who target them to bring them before the courts			0
' it is important that we safeguard the people in our neighbourhoods who need it most so if you have suspicions that they are being targeted by criminals , please come forward and contact police			0
