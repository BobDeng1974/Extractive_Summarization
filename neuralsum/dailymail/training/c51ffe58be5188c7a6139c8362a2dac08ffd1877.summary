by @entity0 parts of the primordial soup in which life arose have been maintained in our cells today according to scientists at the @entity7 ( @entity7 )			1
research published in the @entity9 reveals how cells in plants , yeast and very likely also in animals still perform ancient reactions			2
these were thought to have been responsible for the origin of life some 4 billion years ago			1
scientists at the @entity7 say our cells have an ancient ability to perform reactions similar to the origin of life 4 billion years ago ( illustrated )			1
the primordial soup theory suggests life began in a pond or ocean			1
@entity26 ( illustrated ) continue to perform similar actions today every living thing on @entity29 depends on a mysterious tangle of molecules called ribosomes			1
these are the cell ’s protein factories , translating the genetic information in @entity36 into an amino acid sequence to create proteins			0
scientists believe that the ribosome - whose history is difficult to track - holds clues to how the first molecules of life came together around four billion years ago			1
now researchers are a step closer to uncovering these clues after modelling the evolution of these biological factories in unprecedented detail			0
the core of the ribosome is essentially the same in all living systems , while the outer regions expand and become complicated as species gain complexity			0
by digitally peeling back the layers of modern ribosomes , scientists at @entity58 in @entity59 were able to model the structures of the very first of these biological factories			0
' the history of the ribosome tells us about the origin of life , ' said @entity69 , a professor in the @entity70 at the @entity58			2
the study compared three - dimensional structures of ribosomes from a variety of species of varying biological complexity , including humans , yeast , bacteria and archaea			0
the researchers found distinct fingerprints in the ribosomes where new structures were added to the ribosomal surface without altering the core			0
the research team then worked the process backwards in time to generate models of simple , primordial ribosomes			2
the primordial soup theory suggests that life began in a pond or ocean as a result of the combination of metals , gases from the atmosphere and some form of energy , such as a lightning strike , to make the building blocks of proteins which would then evolve into all species			1
the new research shows how small pockets of a cell - known as mitochondria - continue to perform similar reactions in our bodies today			1
these reactions involve iron , sulfur and electro - chemistry and are still important for functions such as respiration in animals and photosynthesis in plants			0
' cells confine certain bits of dangerous chemistry to specific compartments of the cell , ' said lead researcher dr @entity124 , from the @entity7 ’s school of @entity126 and the @entity127 ( @entity127 )			2
' for example small pockets of a cell called mitochondria deal with electrochemistry and also with toxic sulfur metabolism			0
' these are very ancient reactions thought to have been important for the origin of life			2
' our research has shown that a toxic sulfur compound is being exported by a mitochondrial transport protein to other parts of the cell			0
' we need sulfur for making iron - sulfur catalysts , again a very ancient chemical process			0
' the work shows that parts of the primordial soup in which life arose has been maintained in our cells today , and is in fact harnessed to maintain important biological reactions			1
' the research was carried out at @entity7 and @entity127 in collaboration with dr @entity156 at the @entity157			2
it was funded by the @entity159 ( @entity159 ) and published in the @entity9			0
this image from the researchers shows a normal plant ( left ) and a plant that can not export sulfur from the mitochondria anymore ( right , looking very small and yellow ) , while at the same time an ancient enzyme required to detoxify sulfur inside mitochondria is also inactivated , suggesting the cells retain an ancient ability			1

scientists at the @entity7 say our cells have ancient ability
cells perform reactions from the origin of life 4 billion years ago
primordial soup theory suggests life began in a pond or ocean
energy such as lightning made the buildings blocks evolve into species
research shows mitochondria continue to perform similar actions today
