by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:25 pm on 11th february 2012 they were once united in common cause - and their mutual appreciation saw @entity5 invite @entity6 to join him and @entity7 to be the first to tee off at his new multimillion pound golf course			0
but several years later , the feel - good era between the @entity11 property tycoon and @entity13 's political leaders seems to have come to a dramatic end			1
@entity5 has launched a blistering attack on @entity13 's first minister over plans to build a ' horrendous ' wind farm off the coast of his luxury @entity13 golf resort			1
in happier times : @entity6 , left , poses with @entity5 at a fashion show in @entity11 in 2006 in an open letter , @entity5 accuses @entity6 of being ' hell bent on destroying @entity13 's coast line and therefore @entity13 itself '			1
the bitter words are a far cry from the love - in the two men enjoyed four years ago when @entity6 backed @entity5 's Â£ 750 million golf development 12 miles north of @entity31 , despite protests from environmentalists and locals about damage to rare sand dunes			0
back then , @entity5 invited @entity6 to join him and actor @entity7 to be the first to tee off on what the businessman described as ' the world 's greatest golf course '			0
@entity5 also heaped praise on @entity6 's administration after it overruled local councillors who rejected the planned golf resort			1
the @entity13 leader backed the golf course by claiming it would create hundreds of tourism jobs around the @entity50 area			2
locals and environmentalists campaigned in vain to save the sand dunes which were home to numerous species of wading birds and wildlife , but the dunes were bulldozed to make way for the fairways in 2009 and 2010			0
the course is due to open in july			0
the development 's website said the development would span around 500 hectares of land , with a championship links golf course , a second 18 - hole links golf course , a hotel surrounded by luxury holiday homes , and a residential village within the @entity74			2
visit : @entity5 on the @entity74 , the site of his controversial luxury golf resort @entity6 's support for the wind farm is consistent with the @entity13 government 's plan to position itself as a leader in the provision and technology of renewable energy			1
the wind farm 's turbines will be visible from the beach and the golf course			1
aides to @entity6 told the @entity90 that any suggestion @entity5 's intervention would influence mr @entity6 's commitment to renewables would be ' laughable '			0
and @entity95 , chief executive of @entity96 , which represents the wind farm industry , reacted with anger to the intervention			1
' who is @entity5 to tell @entity13 what is good for our economy or environment ? ' @entity95 said in a statement			2
' he completely over-blows the impact of the proposed wind farm and to be honest there are so many mistakes in this " trumped up " nonsense that it 's difficult to know where to begin			1
' @entity5 tells @entity6 in the ill - tempered letter : ' with the reckless installation of these monsters , you will single - handedly have done more damage to @entity13 than any event in @entity13 history ! ' natural beauty : @entity74 country park in @entity50			2
@entity5 said : ' when i saw this piece of land i was overwhelmed by the imposing dunes and rugged @entity50 coastline ' he adds : ' i will never be " on board " , as you have stated i would be , with this insanity			0
' the tycoon warns @entity6 that he will be using his wealth to fight his government 's renewables policy			0
' i have just authorized my staff to allocate a substantial amount of money to launch an international campaign to fight your plan to surround @entity13 's coast with many thousands of wind turbines - it will be like looking through the bars of a prison and @entity13 citizens will be like prisoners ! ' he ridicules the @entity148 's renewable energy policies , claiming the economic benefit is going to @entity150 and other countries , not @entity13			1
' @entity152 will not be created in @entity13 because these ugly monstrosities known as turbines are manufactured in other countries such as @entity150			0
' these countries , who so benefit from your billions of pounds of payments , are laughing at you ! ' @entity5 said			0
@entity5 concludes the attack by referring to his mother , who was raised in @entity13			2
he adds : ' i 'm doing this to save @entity13 and honor my mother ... '			1

tycoon says his *opposition* to wind farm off the coast of his luxury @entity13 golf resort is ' to save @entity13 and honor my mother ... '
