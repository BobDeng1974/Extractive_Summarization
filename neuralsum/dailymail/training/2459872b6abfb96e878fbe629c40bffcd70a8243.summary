it 's been nearly six months since @entity1 lost the love of her life			2
what happened to him ? where did he go ? is he dead ? or could he possibly be alive ? these are just some of the questions which remain unanswered not just for @entity10 ' wife but also their two little boys @entity12 , 4 , and @entity13 , 1			1
how can life go on when all a grieving family has to go by are the conspiracy theories about how a plane somehow disappeared off the face of the earth			1
in an interview with @entity23 , for @entity24 , the @entity21 mother - of - two spoke of her continual disbelief and utter despair ever since @entity27 mysteriously vanished on march 8			1
all she 's left with are the memories and his final parting gift - his wedding ring			2
she waited for days , weeks and months - still , nothing			2
@entity10 is among the 239 lost souls on the @entity27 aircraft , which still remains missing the 40 - year - old says her life stopped the moment she was informed that her 39 - year - old husband was among the 239 lost souls when @entity47 @entity46 crashed into a remote area of the southern @entity49			1
this was n't part of their grand plan - of moving to @entity21 , leading a simple family life and most importantly growing old together			0
the couple first met 14 years ago at @entity56 in @entity57			0
from then on , romance was born and they pair lived together in @entity61 for a couple of years until they relocated to @entity64 in @entity67 - mr weeks ' hometown			2
but following the earthquakes , they decided to make the move to @entity21 in 2011 where they wanted to settle down and raise their two kids			0
on march 8 , mr @entity10 boarded @entity27 so he could make his way to @entity76 to start his new fly - in - fly - out job as a mechanical engineer			1
his precious final moments are ingrained in mrs weeks ' memories , as she revealed that her husband gave her his watch and wedding ring amid concerns that something may happen to him at the mining site			1
he requested the wedding ring was to go to the first son who gets married and the watch to the second			0
but for now , mrs weeks keeps the ring close to her heart by wearing it around her neck			1
' every night now i go home and it 's lonely , it â€™s very lonely			0
when you 've had someone there for 14 years , how do you keep going when they 're gone ? ' the mother - of - two with her boys @entity12 , 4 , and @entity13 , 1 at their @entity21 home yet the grieving mother tries to keep it together , for the sake of her children			0
and while mrs weeks herself is n't able to put piece the puzzle together herself , she was left with the harrowing task of explaining to her two sons what happened to their father			1
for eldest son @entity12 , who 's understood that his daddy has gone to work forever , he 's left anxious that the same will happen to his mother			0
witnessing how the tragedy has affected her child , mrs weeks is determined more than ever to bring closure to all suffering families			1
' that 's why i wo n't rest until i find out what happened to @entity126			2
that 's why i wo n't let [ @entity47 ] treat him like a seat number			1
i have to keep him alive			0
and i wo n't rest until we find out what happened to him and to everyone else on that plane , ' she said			1
as for the second devastating @entity47 disaster , where a plane flying over the @entity144 - @entity143 conflict was shot down on july 17 and claimed 298 lives , the pain of loss and bewilderment hit too close to home for mrs week			1
' just feel so heart broken , all over again , for all the families of @entity150 , ' she wrote on her @entity151			0
the 39 - year - old mechanical engineer , from @entity67 , was a dedicated father to his two sons on board the missing @entity47 @entity46 were 12 crew members and 227 passengers meanwhile , the search continues for the doomed @entity46 as air crash investigators hope to further narrow down the planned search area to find the aircraft within the next year			1
the plane vanished with 12 crew members and 227 passengers on board after it departed @entity164 in @entity165 to @entity166 in @entity167			1
upon several failed aerial searches to spot any wreckage from the airliner , experts have studied radar and satellite data in a bid to close in on the crash site			0
@entity176 of the @entity177 is leading the search and feels confident that he will be able to announce a smaller search area shortly based on satellite data and the use of flight simulators			0
he said new seabed surveys have also produced some interesting findings including hard objects that seem inconsistent with their surroundings , although there is no guarantee that this is the aircraft			0
for @entity150 , operation ' bring them home ' as seen the first bodies of @entity194 victims arrive back from @entity195 to @entity196			0
