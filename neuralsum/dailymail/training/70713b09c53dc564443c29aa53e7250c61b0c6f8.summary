by @entity1 reporter a handful of history buffs and curious onlookers watched today as a bulldozer tore through the walls of a dilapidated apartment building where @entity8 lived a few months before the assassination of president @entity10			1
the uninhabited 10 - unit , two - story apartment complex built in 1925 was one of several remaining places tied to @entity10 's nov. 22 , 1963 , assassination , which remains perhaps the most infamous moment in @entity18 history			1
@entity8 lived at the building at 600 @entity20 with his wife , @entity22 , and young daughter from november 1962 to march 1963			1
the residence is mentioned in the @entity26 report that investigated @entity10 's death and concluded @entity8 acted alone			1
it 's history : the @entity18 apartment building where @entity8 lived shortly before president @entity10 was assassinated is demolished today			1
the bulldozer ramming through the walls started with the side where @entity8 lived			1
police blocked off @entity35 and the sidewalk in front , but let onlookers grab bricks from the side of the building			2
last seconds : bulldozer is set to smash into @entity8 's former @entity18 home @entity44 , a local resident and musician , put five bricks in a backpack as souvenirs and possibly sale items later			1
@entity44 said the building was included on tours he once gave to groups interested in the many alternate theories about @entity10 's death			1
" people sell this crap for money , " @entity44 said			0
" i 'm doing it out of a weird , kitschy interest			0
" collector 's item : @entity44 gathers bricks @entity63 said he was fascinated by the history of two presidential assassins — @entity8 and @entity66 , who killed @entity67			1
@entity63 had heard about the upcoming demolition on the news and eventually purchased an apartment window for $ 125 online			0
his goal , he said , was to build a " traveling wall " around the window so it could be displayed to others			0
" he still lived here , and in my opinion , he 's a part of @entity18 history , " @entity63 said			1
" maybe for the wrong reason , but he 's still a part of history			0
" @entity10 's assassination still generates plenty of controversy , particularly as theories still circulate about whether @entity8 acted alone			1
president @entity10 's nephew , @entity85 , said over the weekend that he believes a second gunman was involved and that his father , @entity85 , who was attorney general at the time , was privately dismissive of the @entity26			1
that report says @entity8 shot @entity10 from the sixth floor of the @entity92 building — now a museum dedicated to @entity10 and the assassination			1
the @entity26 also concluded that @entity8 killed @entity18 police officer @entity95 45 minutes after @entity10 was shot			1
@entity8 was arrested in the hours after the assassination , but was killed two days later by nightclub owner @entity97			2
@entity98 , curator of the @entity99 , said @entity8 ordered the revolver that killed @entity95 in january 1963 , when @entity8 was living at the @entity35 apartment			1
but , he added , " the most important parts of the @entity8 story are what he did , not where he did them			0
" @entity107 bought the apartment building in 2007 but was never able to realize plans to renovate it			0
the city got a court order last may to have it razed and took over demolition when @entity114 failed to act quickly enough			0
the city estimated demolition and asbestos abatement would run about $ 52,000 and said it may put a lien on the property to recover its costs			0
preparation : construction crews readied the house for demolition keep away : a city worker cuts a chain link fence surrounding the apartment complex prior to demolition @entity114 was emotional about seeing the building being demolished			0
she previously told the @entity130 that she had n't known that the process had begun until she was informed by a reporter			0
' the city of @entity18 told me if i was making progress on the building , they would stop it , ' @entity114 said			2
' they agreed to give me more time			0
' the owner had been trying to salvage the valuable and historic parts of the building that was built in 1925			2
she believed she had around two weeks left			0
@entity114 has already sold the toilet and bathtub from @entity8 's old apartment but wanted to remove the old pine and white oak from the property			2
crumbling : the disheveled apartment was uninhabited and had a number of building code violations			0
she told the @entity130 that she was trying to contact her lawyer to file a restraining order to stop the demolition , and that police on monday had refused to let her into the building			0
' we 're not just losing a piece of fundamental history to @entity18 related to the assassination , we 're also losing a piece of fundamental architecture to this area , ' said @entity114			2
abandoned : no one has lived in the run - down home for several years @entity166 lived here : @entity8 resided in apartment number 2			1
the building 's owner has sold off a number of things from his home , including the toilet @entity175 , executive director of @entity176 , noted that there are more important buildings associated with @entity8 than the @entity35 apartment , including the boarding house where he was staying the day of the assassination and the @entity182 , where @entity8 was arrested			1
after leaving the @entity35 apartment , @entity8 moved a few blocks away , to @entity184 - where the famous pictures were taken of him posing in the backyard holding the rifle used in the assassination			2
he was living at a boarding house in the same area but on @entity191 when @entity10 was assassinated			0
swept away : a police officer and a worker prepare to tear down the historic building gone : the owner said that by demolishing the apartment , they are losing a piece of history @entity114 did n't know of the site 's link to history until the year after she bought it			2
after a local television station did a piece the building she had dreams of renovating , people got in contact to let her know of the @entity8 connection			2
she notes that the building has been a point of interest , adding that she 'd had tourists from overseas come by the complex on @entity220			0
face of an assassin : the @entity224 mugshot of @entity8 from 1963			0
