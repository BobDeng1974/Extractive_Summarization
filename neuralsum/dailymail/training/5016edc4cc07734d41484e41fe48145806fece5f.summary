he had two bottles with him , which may have been petrol - drinking one and covering himself in the other the man was seen calmly sitting on a small mat on top of @entity5 's @entity4 railway station bridge , dressed in a suit and next to two bottles of gasoline , before he set himself on fire firefighters pulled the man down onto the pedestrian bridge , using hoses and a fire extinguisher before he was taken away the man was soon engulfed by a huge ball of fire as hundreds of people watched on in horror witnesses said the man spoke through a megaphone to protest the government 's moves to change @entity56 's defence policy to allow it to play a more assertive role in international security witnesses were quoted as saying the man spoke through a megaphone to protest the government 's moves to change @entity56 's defence policy			1
