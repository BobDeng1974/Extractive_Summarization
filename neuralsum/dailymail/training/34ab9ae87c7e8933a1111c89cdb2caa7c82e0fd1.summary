a sharp rise in the number of hospitals missing cancer waiting time targets is putting lives ‘ at risk ’ , a charity warned last night			1
damning figures emerged yesterday which show that the number of @entity11 trusts missing the main cancer waiting target has tripled in just a year			1
the @entity11 recommends that no one should wait longer than 62 days after being referred urgently by their gp for suspected cancer			1
@entity11 recommends that no one should wait longer than 62 days after being referred urgently by their gp for suspected cancer ( file photo ) a government target requires that 85 per cent of patients are seen within this time			1
but between january and march this year , no fewer than 27 @entity11 trusts missed the target – up from eight over the same period the year before			2
it means that thousands of cancer patients are waiting far too long for potentially life - saving treatment , thanks to a shortage of consultants and mri scanners			2
separate figures show that the amount of money spent on @entity11 cancer care has fallen by almost £ 800million in real terms since the election			1
the revelation comes on the day that health secretary @entity37 addresses the @entity39 conference in @entity40			0
the @entity41 says the rise is down to the fact that more people are being treated			0
separate figures show that the amount of money spent on @entity11 cancer care has fallen by almost £ 800million in real terms since the @entity47 revelation comes on the day that health secretary @entity37 addresses the @entity39 conference in @entity40 but @entity48 , @entity49 ’s health spokesman , said : ‘ @entity37 should stand up before the @entity39 conference today and order an immediate halt to these disgraceful cuts to cancer care			1
‘ on his watch , people are waiting longer for treatment and tests and now we know why			0
‘ this is why people ca n’t trust him and @entity60 with the @entity11			2
he should apologise and produce a plan to bring cancer services back up to the national standard			0
’ the figures on the number of trusts failing to meet the target were contained in a report published by health regulator monitor two weeks ago			0
@entity48 , @entity49 ’s health spokesman , said : ‘ @entity37 should stand up before the @entity39 conference today and order an immediate halt to these disgraceful cuts to cancer care ' it found that : ‘ performance against cancer waiting time targets has steadily deteriorated over the past year			1
‘ the number of trusts failing the target rose to 27 at @entity80 compared with 8 at @entity81			0
’ the report said the high level of referrals from @entity85 had led to the decline in performance , but added : ‘ when combined with rising emergency demand and elective referrals , a further increase in cancer referrals creates pressure on diagnostic , surgical and inpatient bed capacity			0
‘ in addition , foundation trusts have also cited late referrals , consultant shortage ( especially in urology ) , complex diagnostic pathways , and inter-trust referral protocols as some of the reasons for breaches			0
’ other reasons include ‘ inadequate outpatient and diagnostic capacity ’			0
figures released following a parliamentary question show that @entity11 expenditure on cancer services has fallen in real terms from £ 5.91billion in 2009/10 , the year before the election , to £ 5.68billion in 2012/13			1
it means that in three years since the election , £ 790million less has been spent on cancer than otherwise would have been spent had pre-election levels been maintained			1
last night @entity116 , head of policy at @entity118 , said : ‘ it is deeply concerning that the number of @entity11 foundation trusts missing the cancer treatment target have more than trebled in just a year			1
‘ delays mean that thousands of cancer patients must put their lives on hold while waiting for vital treatment - causing anxiety , distress and putting their lives at serious risk			2
‘ these delays are yet another clear warning sign that the system is n’t working and the @entity11 is under huge strain			2
‘ everyone should have the best possible chance to survive cancer but lives are being put at risk and this ca n’t continue			0
we already have some of the poorest survival rates for cancer in @entity145			0
@entity146 is calling on all the political parties to ensure that cancer remains a top priority ahead of the next general election			2

amount of money spent on @entity11 cancer care has fallen by almost £ 800million in real terms since election
@entity11 recommends no one should wait more than 62 days after referral
