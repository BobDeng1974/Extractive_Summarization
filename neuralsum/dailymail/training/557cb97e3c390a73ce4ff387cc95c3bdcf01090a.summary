by @entity0 published : 03:26 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 18:27 est , 25 june 2013 over $ 1 million in $ 100 bills was stolen from a shipping container on a @entity4 air passenger flight on its way to @entity6 and investigators still do n't know who 's to blame			1
the shipment on flight 17 left @entity11 saturday , but by the time it reached its destination at the @entity14 , $ 1.2 million of the $ 92 million aboard was gone			1
‘ when it got here , the money was missing , ’ @entity16 spokesman @entity15 said			1
heist : police are investigating after $ 1.2million in cash was found to be missing from a @entity23 jet when it arrived at @entity24 , pictured , in @entity6 yesterday the theft was discovered at the official count of the cash at the @entity14 offices in @entity29			1
however , it remains unclear if the money was stolen in @entity4 or somewhere en route			0
according to @entity34 , a forklift operator ' opened the sealed crate and noticed damage to one of the crates in the form of a puncture from a forklift			0
it was a hole large enough to put your arm in			0
' however , the operator failed to report the hole because such damage commonly occurs to the crates after years of use			0
' we do not have any indication of a robbery of a @entity4 aircraft , ' a @entity23 representative told @entity34			0
officials have not disclosed who the money was meant for or why it was being sent			0
a spokesman for the @entity16 in @entity6 @entity15 confirmed that the theft was being investigated but would not elaborate on the details			1
no comment : @entity15 , spokesman for the @entity16 in @entity6 , confirmed the incident but declined to provide further information investigators are now looking in to how many mechanics , crew members and airport personnel had access to the jet and whether any of them could feasibly have emptied the box and escaped unnoticed			2
according to the @entity71 , $ 1 million in $ 100 bills is estimated to weigh just 22 pounds , meaning a thief could easily cart around the cash			1
the largest cash heist in @entity24 history happened on december 11 , 1978 , when an estimated $ 5 million was stolen at the @entity77 terminal			2
at the time it was also the largest cash theft to have been carried out on @entity80 soil and went on to be portrayed in the movie ' @entity81 '			0
it is not unusual for airlines to transport large sums of money - with a single flight sometimes carrying more than $ 1 billion			2
