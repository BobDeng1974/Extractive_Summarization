no campaigners last night lit up three of @entity2 's most famous tourist attractions with a clear message about which way the electorate should vote today			1
a large no was projected onto @entity7 , @entity8 and the @entity9 in @entity10 in an audacious last - minute public relations stroke			1
the 50 foot high message was shone on the rocky outcrop below @entity7 castle around 10pm as the people of @entity2 deliberate the future of the @entity17			1
labour leader @entity34 posted an image of the @entity7 display on his @entity38 feed which was retweeted more than 500 times within three hours of his message			1
one source said : ' i do n't want to say too much about it			0
i ca n't tell you who was behind the show as they do not want that information getting out			0
' the concept is called @entity49 where a powerful light beam - sometimes featuring lasers is broadcast on an iconic building or structure			0
it can also be used in guerrilla advertising campaigns although the legality of the stunts has been questioned			0
in october 2010 @entity58 threatened legal action against @entity60 who beamed a message on the side of @entity64 taunting the @entity66 cricket team			2
in 1999 @entity64 was targeted with a naked image of television presenter @entity68 beamed across it			0
later @entity71 campaigners attempted to recreate the earlier stunt although the images were not as impressive			2

no campaigners projected a clear message on the side of three *landmarks*
@entity7 , @entity8 and the @entity9 were lit up last night
labour leader @entity34 retweeted the pictures *shortly* after 10pm
an *un-named* *group* was behind the audacious ' projection *bombing* ' stunt
