click here to read the full match report from @entity2 little more than 24 hours after claiming to take a more cerebral approach to football management than his contemporaries , @entity3 suddenly developed a previously undetected degree of modesty			1
it revealed itself after he was asked , in the wake of the win over @entity12 , if he had a clear vision of what was required to rebuild @entity15 — a task he said on friday could take him three years			1
‘ when i say i have a clear vision i ’m considered arrogant , ’ he said			2
‘ but when you see what i have done in my career you have to know that i have a vision and that i ’m very confident			2
i do n’t think that is arrogant			2
it is self - confidence			1
it ’s a big challenge but i knew that in advance			2
otherwise i could have chosen another club			2
’ right now the challenge seems a daunting one , particularly when he has to keep tinkering with his team to carve out the results that are just about keeping them in contention for the @entity35 places			0
if he had an idea of how @entity15 would play at the start of the season , circumstances have forced @entity50 to adapt			1
on saturday he unveiled the third formation in only 12 games in charge , with @entity54 in central midfield alongside @entity56 in a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 line - up that had @entity58 deployed in front of a makeshift back four			1
on a day when @entity63 and @entity64 were partnered in central defence , the extra protection provided by a five - man midfield ensured a first clean sheet in six games			1
but it numbed @entity15 ’s potency in attack and that was something even @entity50 acknowledged after @entity74 ’s deflected , 67th - minute goal had secured a stuttering victory			1
@entity54 was handed a midfield role on his return as @entity50 changed formation again @entity79 was substituted after an ineffectual performance where he was denied space to dribble @entity15 ’s @entity56 was clearly held round the neck by @entity12 defender @entity83 as he jumped for a header in the area			1
‘ it ’s too much i think , i agree , ’ he said of yet another formation change			0
‘ but i ’m looking for the balance and when you see the last four matches , we have had more balance because we have n’t conceded many goals			1
but we do n’t score so much			0
with the other system we scored a lot of goals			0
‘ i said at half - time to @entity54 and @entity56 that you have to play higher up in support of @entity102			2
i had to correct them			0
’ he might have corrected them but @entity79 , so brilliant when he first arrived from @entity105 , remained a subdued figure			0
@entity50 hooked him , as he did the equally ineffective @entity107			0
the @entity108 insisted it was a consequence of negative @entity12 tactics			1
@entity63 ( @entity111 ) lined up in the centre of defence after playing most of his games in midfield @entity58 ( r ) was given a holding role that helped @entity15 earn a rare clean sheet ‘ @entity79 has played in a very small space , ’ he said			1
‘ he is a dribbler but sometimes you can not dribble			0
you have to make it a passing game and @entity79 is not a player who wants to give a pass every time he gets the ball			0
’ a lack of balance will remain an issue until @entity50 can add quality to his defence			1
but he takes some encouragement from the fact that his side are only two points adrift of the @entity35 places despite a difficult start and despite the fact they have taken only 16 points from 11 games			0
@entity15 had 22 points at the same stage last season under @entity145			1
‘ of course we need to raise our level , ’ he said			0
‘ but it ’s also a matter of getting over a lot of injuries			0
i ’ve never had so many injuries in my career			0
it ’s crazy but it ’s what i have to deal with			0
’ video fourth place still in our hands - @entity50			2

@entity15 defeated @entity12 1 - 0 in the @entity158
@entity160 boss @entity3 again *experimented* with his formations
the @entity108 is trying to find a ' balance ' between attack and defence
