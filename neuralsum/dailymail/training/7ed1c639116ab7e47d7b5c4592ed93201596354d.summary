by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:52 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 03:42 est , 5 june 2013 @entity2 is to study @entity4 ’s rise from political outrider to prime minister , in a move seen as research for his own political ambitions			1
the @entity11 mayor has announced he is writing a book on the wartime pm , fuelling suspicions in @entity15 that he is biding his time before bidding for the top job himself			2
doing little to play down speculation about his hopes of succeeding @entity21 as @entity23 leader , mr @entity2 said he wanted to show how ‘ one man can make all the difference ’			2
@entity26 : @entity2 is to write a biography of sir @entity4 , because @entity28 wants to show how ' one man can make a difference ' some might argue that as mayor of one of the world ’s great capital cities , mr @entity2 has enough work to do without writing a biography on one of @entity38 ’s greatest leaders			1
he already receives a reported £ 250,000 - a - year to write a weekly newspaper column on top of the £ 144,000 as mayor of @entity11			0
but friends of mr @entity2 insist he is a workaholic , and is determined to press ahead with the book on sir @entity4 for publication in autumn 2014			1
publishers @entity47 said the @entity26 would focus on the ‘ character , life , legacy and meaning today ’ of the former prime minister , adding to the sense that this is not entirely an historical work			1
the more mischievous will no doubt look for references in the finished work to mr @entity2 ’s own hopes to swap @entity58 for @entity59			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ i am interested in the memory of @entity4 , and how it has been distorted			1
' i want to shine a light on some aspects of @entity4 ’s character and to explain how @entity4 made a difference to events or to society – and explore his meaning and his message today			1
‘ he is the resounding human rebuttal to all @entity73 historians who think history is the story of vast and impersonal economic forces			0
‘ the point of the ‘ ‘ @entity26 ’ ’ is that one man can make all the difference			0
’ ambitions : @entity2 has said he would love to ' have a crack ' at being prime minister if @entity21 was forced out it is not hard to see how this remark could refer to the impact that a 21st century @entity23 mayor can have , just as much as reflections on sir @entity4 ’s leadership during @entity89			1
earlier this year mr @entity2 finally admitted he would like to have a ‘ crack ’ at being prime minister			2
‘ i think it 's a very tough job being prime minister , ’ he said in a @entity92 documentary			0
‘ obviously , if the ball came loose from the back of a scrum - which it wo n't - it would be a great , great thing to have a crack at			0
’ however , @entity99 questioned whether such a senior politician should be spending his time writing books			0
@entity103 , @entity99 's shadow minister for @entity11 , told @entity104 : ‘ being mayor is a full time job			0
there is wide respect for @entity4 but @entity109 at this difficult time want someone focused 100 per cent on improving their city , not distracted by flights of fancy			0

@entity2 says he wants to *highlight* the ' meaning today ' of one of @entity38 's greatest *premiers*
he *claims* @entity4 's memory has been ' distorted ' by history
book *due* to be published in autumn 2014 , *months* before *general* *election*
*critics* say he should be concentrating on the day job
