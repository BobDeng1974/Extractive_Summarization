@entity0 were wearing bling around 4,000 years before today ’s flashy pop stars and footballers , reveals new research			2
a study proved our ancestors adorned themselves with necklaces featuring mollusc shells			2
scientists analysed amino acids to identify the raw materials used to make beads in a 4,000 year old necklace unearthed during an archaeological dig in @entity16			1
beads in a 4,000 year old necklace ( pictured ) were found to be made of @entity20 whelks and tusk shells			1
the @entity22 began in @entity23 about 2,000 bc when new bronze tools and weapons were brought over from continental @entity26			2
the skulls recovered from burial sites from the @entity22 are different in shape from @entity31 skulls , suggesting new ideas and new blood were arriving			1
@entity34 and bronze can be used together , subject to the availability of both materials			2
true bronze is a combination of 10 per cent tin and 90 per cent copper			0
both materials were readily available in @entity23 at this time			0
before its entry into @entity23 , the @entity22 was in full swing in @entity26			2
the island of @entity46 was centre for the expansion of the bronze trade to @entity26			0
the @entity49 created the finest bronze weapons			0
they came from southern @entity52 at around 2,000 @entity53 , and settled in the lowlands of @entity55			0
there they began to trade with the @entity58			0
they built a large navy , and began to attack nearby lands			0
@entity63 craftsmen used species such as dog whelk and tusk shells , both of which were likely to have been sourced and worked locally , to fashion the tiny disc - shaped balls , according to the findings published in the journal @entity72			1
the necklace was found by archaeologists at an @entity22 burial site at @entity76 , near @entity77 , and researchers wanted to know where the items came from			1
the @entity83 thorny oyster , for instance , is a shell of long - standing symbolic and cultural significance which is known to have been used on the continent around the time when the necklace was made			1
but powerful microscopes found this not to be the case , and an alternative possibility has now been suggested			0
dr @entity93 , of the @entity94 , said : ‘ @entity20 whelks and tusk shells were likely to be available locally so these people did not have to travel far to get hold of the raw materials for their beads			1
dr @entity93 , of the @entity94 , said : ' @entity95 and tusk shells were likely to be available locally so these people did not have to travel far to get hold of the raw materials for their beads '			1
@entity102 left and right are microscopic images of the beads , which are pictured top left and right ‘ there is evidence , from elsewhere in @entity23 and further afield , for the use of tusk shells at various times in the past			1
this may well be because they are relatively easy to work and their hollow shape is very distinctive			0
’ study co-author dr @entity114 added : ‘ the statistical analysis used pattern recognition algorithms for taxonomic identification , comparing the composition of the beads with a large database of shell amino acid compositions			0
‘ although we can not know the origin of the beads for certain , our multi-disciplinary approach provides additional evidence for the identifications			0
’ the necklace was found by archaeologists at an @entity22 burial site at @entity76 , near @entity77			1

the 4,000 - year - old necklace was found in an archaeological dig in @entity16
scientists analysed amino acids to identify its raw materials
this revealed the necklace was made using dog whelk and tusk shells
these materials would have been sourced locally by @entity22 craftsmen
necklace was found at an @entity22 burial site at @entity76
