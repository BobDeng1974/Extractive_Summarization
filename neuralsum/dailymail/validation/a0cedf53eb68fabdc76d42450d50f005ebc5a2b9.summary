environmentalists involved in prince @entity4 's @entity3 tour warned @entity6 diplomats not to let him visit a park where elephants perform circus tricks two months ago , @entity0 has learnt			1
but the advice – given to officials at @entity6 's @entity16 consulate as the @entity4 's itinerary was drafted in january – was brushed aside , one of the ecologists said yesterday			1
the @entity4 's tour – on which he was accompanied by four press officers – ended in a pr disaster when he visited a rescue centre at @entity22 , only a few yards from an arena where elephants play football , dance and do tricks for tourists			1
in the spotlight : prince @entity4 surrounded by his support team in @entity3 during his royal tour the degrading performances at @entity22 that happen just yards from the rescue centre visited by @entity4 last month @entity0 revealed the @entity4 would be visiting the park and informed the @entity35 of the cruel conditions , but @entity38 sources claimed prince @entity4 wanted to visit regardless so he could ' shine a spotlight ' on the issue			1
however when the @entity4 was at the park , and was asked by @entity42 if he knew elephants were performing nearby , he seemed wrong - footed , hurrying away in silence as journalist @entity45 called after him : ' the @entity3 are using elephants to play football , your @entity48			1
' ecologist @entity50 , an associate professor based at @entity51 , said : ' when the @entity6 consulate told us ' we might take prince @entity4 to @entity22 ' , we all said unanimously , ' do n't take him there			2
it 's basically a circus			0
' we warned the @entity6 consulate off but i think some of them are very , very naïve			1
' she added : ' i do n't believe our concerns were filtered through to any higher levels			0
if prince @entity4 had known what was going on there , i do n't think there is any possibility he would have gone			0
i think he must have been assured they really were doing conservation work			0
' both @entity35 and the @entity66 declined to say if the concerns had been passed on to the @entity4			0
but yesterday one of his aides insisted : ' prince @entity4 absolutely knew what was happening			0
' another aide said : ' our view is , this was n't embarrassing			0
it was an essential thing for the @entity75 to do and one of the key reasons he went is to encourage conservation efforts and that comes in complex packaging			2
' both @entity35 and the @entity66 declined to say if the concerns had been passed on to the @entity4 , pictured during his visit a @entity84 spokesman added : ' it goes without saying the @entity75 does not condone the performances , but he recognises the incredible work @entity22 has done to protect the elephant population			1
' but @entity89 , from the @entity90 and @entity91 , said : ' tourists will flock to @entity22 now			2
prince @entity4 is indirectly supporting cruelty to elephants forced to take part in these circus performances			0
