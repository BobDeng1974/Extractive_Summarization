by @entity0 last updated at 2:38 pm on 28th january 2012 ' inappropriate ' : @entity3 chairman sir @entity2 has turned down a £ 1.4million bonus payout , it emerged today @entity3 chief - executive @entity5 is under further pressure to turn down his near £ 1million bonus today after his own chairman rejected a payout			1
sir @entity2 was in line to receive 5.17million shares - worth £ 1.4million - from the bank which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer			1
but he turned the payment down as he thinks it is ' inappropriate ' to accept the windfall that he was to receive later this year			2
an @entity3 spokesman said : ' sir @entity2 will not receive the 5.17 million shares he was awarded in 2009 when he joined @entity3			1
' mr @entity5 will now come under further pressure to follow suit and waive his payout			2
his £ 963,000 payout has caused national outrage as the state - owned bank has missed lending targets , laid off 3,500 staff and seen its share price plunge 40 per cent			2
@entity27 said today that it was for mr @entity5 to decide whether he should accept the payment			1
sir @entity2 is believed to have taken his decision to reject the payment some time ago			1
he was in line to receive the shares as part of a deal negotiated by @entity36 , a @entity38 peer , who was in line to take the job			0
when @entity36 turned the post down , sir @entity2 was given the post on the same package			1
@entity27 warned today installing a new top team at failed bank @entity3 could be even ' more expensive ' than it is now as the furore of @entity5 's bonus continued			1
pressure : sir @entity5 is in line to receive almost £ 1million as a bonus and faces further pressure to turn it down but the prime minister insisted it was up to the chief executive to decide whether to give up his £ 1 million bonus			1
' it 's a matter for him , ' he said			0
' it 's obviously his decision			0
my decision is to make sure the team at @entity3 get on with the job of turning the bank round and we made our views very clear on the bonus and that 's why it was cut in half compared to last year			2
' a man wearing a ' fat cat ' suit stands outside @entity3 in @entity73 earlier this week mr @entity27 was speaking at @entity74 as news emerged that @entity3 chairman sir @entity2 had decided to waive his £ 1.4m shares bonus			1
mr @entity27 added : ' i think we need to get the facts straight			0
' the fact is @entity5 was brought in by the last government , a contract signed by the last government to turn round @entity3 - a bank that had got itself into a complete mess			2
' the government has made its views known and that is why his bonus was cut in half compared to last year			0
' but we do have to bear in mind that the alternatives to what 's happening now could be even more expensive if you had a whole new team coming into @entity3			0
' @entity97 sources said mr @entity5 , who is on a basic salary of £ 1.2million , should hand back the ' immoral ' bonus as a gesture of good faith			1
mr @entity5 may gain a further £ 400,000 if - as analysts expect - the 3.6million @entity3 shares that form his bonus rise in value			1
by close of trading last night , they were worth £ 998,000 - a rise of £ 35,000 in one day			0
@entity109 said he shared the public 's dismay and urged mr @entity112 to copy @entity113 , of @entity114 , the other state - owned bank , in forgoing his bonus			1
under pressure : the prime minister said today it is for sir @entity5 to deceide whether he accepts a near £ 1m shares payout from @entity3 @entity121 has accused @entity27 of a ' disgraceful failure of leadership ' for failing to block mr @entity5 's payment			1
' he 's been promising for months action against excessive bonuses , executive pay , and now he 's nodded through a million - pound bonus , ' said the @entity38 leader			2
' he must now explain , not least to the @entity131 people , why he has allowed this to happen			0
' rattled by the public outcry , @entity134 and the @entity135 sought to shift the blame to the @entity3 board , saying it was being managed at ' arm 's length ' by @entity139 , the agency in charge of public banking assets			0
asked if mr @entity27 was ' relaxed ' about the bonus payment a @entity134 spokesman replied : ' no. ' a senior government official told the @entity145 : ' of course we 'd like to see him to give it up as a gesture of good faith but we have done what we can			0
' we ca n't tell him to do that			0
he has done a good job and put the bank back on track but that means those shares are likely to climb again in future			0
if the share price bounces back ... i hate to think of the stink that will cause			0
' @entity3 has been criticised for failing to hit targets for lending to hard - pressed businesses .			0

sir @entity2 rejects £ 1.4million payout - or 5.17million shares - he was *due* to receive this year
@entity27 : ' it 's for sir @entity5 to decide whether he takes his bonus '
@entity114 boss @entity113 has already turned down his bonus
