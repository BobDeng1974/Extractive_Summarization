@entity0 is a fan of the rotation policy judging by his start to life as @entity5 manager			2
the @entity6 has spent north of £ 150million buying stars from across the globe but does not seem so sure how he is going to fit them all in , using 33 players in just five matches this season			1
and 14 years after @entity12 , the original ' @entity13 ' , was appointed as @entity16 boss on september 18 , 2000 , it seems fitting that a new @entity18 manager is willing to experiment			1
@entity0 has become the new ' @entity13 ' after fielding 33 different players in five matches this year @entity20 is one of @entity22 's new recruits to @entity5 this summer , leading to his large squad rotation @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) also arrived to @entity26 during a £ 150m spending spree @entity5 captain @entity28 is one of six different forwards used by @entity22 this season @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 ( right ) both featured for @entity22 before departing @entity5 @entity12 ( pictured ) , who was appointed @entity16 boss exactly 14 years ago , was branded as the original ' @entity13 ' due to a perceived over-rotation of his squad during his tenure at @entity36 @entity5 have used 33 players so far this season in just five matches			1
@entity0 has used one goalkeeper , nine defenders , six forwards and an incredible 17 different midfielders in four @entity18 fixtures and one league cup match			1
goalkeepers ( 1 ) : @entity45			0
defenders ( 9 ) : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55			0
midfielders ( 17 ) : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity25 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( now on loan at @entity65 ) , @entity66 , @entity30 ( now on loan at @entity68 ) , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ( now at @entity73 ) , @entity74 ( now on loan at @entity76 ) , @entity24 , @entity77			0
forwards ( 6 ) : @entity28 , @entity79 , @entity31 ( now at @entity80 ) , @entity81 ( now on loan at @entity83 ) , @entity84 , @entity20			0
@entity5 have had four matches in the @entity18 and one in the @entity86 and have used five more players than any other top - flight side			2
@entity89 are second having used 28 players in five matches , with @entity93 third on 27 ( although they have played eight games this season )			1
@entity96 have played the fewest matches ( four ) and have rotated their squad the least - with just 17 different @entity96 have taken to the field - while @entity16 and @entity100 have used just 18 players in five matches each , indicating that @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 are all happy with their squads			1
@entity22 has fielded 26 different players in the @entity18 alone , three greater than the next most - rotated sides @entity93 and @entity108			2
with seven new faces at @entity26 this summer - including @entity20 , @entity24 and @entity109 has arguably become the new ' @entity13 ' after changing his side drastically for each match so far this season			2
@entity69 is one of an astonishing 17 different midfielders that @entity5 have used this season youngsters such as @entity84 ( left ) have also been used by @entity22 as he looks for his best side @entity89 have fielded the second highest number of players this year , having used 28 in five matches @entity93 boss @entity119 has fielded 27 players this season but they have played a total of eight matches @entity12 was the original ' @entity13 ' during his time at @entity16 , where he spent four years as boss @entity96 have fielded the fewest players this year ( four ) but have also played the fewest matches ( four ) 1 ) @entity5 - 33 players ( five games in all competitions ) 2 ) @entity89 - 28 ( five games ) 3 ) @entity93 - 27 ( eight games ) 4 ) @entity108 - 25 ( five games ) = 4 ) @entity134 - 25 ( five games ) 6 ) @entity136 - 24 ( six games ) = 6 ) @entity138 - 24 ( five games ) = 6 ) @entity140 - 24 ( five games ) 9 ) @entity142 - 22 ( five games ) = 9 ) @entity80 - 22 ( eight games ) 11 ) @entity145 - 21 ( five games ) = 11 ) @entity148 - 21 ( five games ) = 11 ) @entity150 - 21 ( five games ) 14 ) @entity151 - 20 ( five games ) = 14 ) @entity154 - 20 ( five games ) = 14 ) @entity156 - 20 ( five games ) 17 ) @entity68 - 19 ( five games ) 18 ) @entity16 - 18 ( five games ) = 18 ) @entity100 - 18 ( five games ) 20 ) @entity96 - 17 ( four games ) * stats provided by @entity162 @entity12 was famously given that moniker for what was perceived as his over-rotation of his @entity16 squad during his four years at @entity36 ( 2000 - 04 ) , but it seems that @entity22 has taken on the mantle			1
in the @entity6 's defence , @entity5 have been ravaged by injuries , and @entity22 has also tried to give youngsters their opportunity in the first team			0
yet he also gave game - time to players such as @entity63 , @entity31 , @entity30 and @entity72 before discarding them and allowing them to leave the club			0
he has also had a look at relatively unknown players @entity51 , @entity70 and @entity52			0
interestingly , the one position @entity22 has not rotated is his goalkeeper - with @entity45 having featured in all five of @entity5 's fixtures in both league and cup			0
in total , @entity5 have used nine defenders , six forwards and a staggering 17 midfielders , as well as @entity189 , in just five matches so far this season			1
and , with @entity22 's history of fielding academy players , it is not beyond the realms of possibility that he will continue to blood an even greater number of youngsters as the season progresses			0
amazingly , @entity199 is yet to make his debut and @entity201 has been injured all season , so @entity22 is almost guaranteed to field at least 35 different players this campaign			2
and who knows how many more there will be if @entity5 repeat the summer spending spree in the next transfer window			0
@entity199 ( left ) and @entity201 ( right ) are yet to play for @entity5 this season so @entity22 could realistically use more than 35 players during his first season in charge at @entity26 @entity79 is one of six different forwards used by @entity0 at @entity5 this season @entity53 is one of nine defenders deployed at @entity5 as @entity22 rotates his squad to find his best team @entity216 defender @entity54 is another expensive new signing at @entity5 @entity218 praises @entity54 @entity45 is the only goalkeeper @entity22 has used , despite having fielded 33 different players			1

@entity5 have used 33 players in just five matches this season
@entity0 has fielded five more players than @entity89 in second
@entity89 have used *second-most* players with 28 in five games
@entity93 third with 27 players used but have played three more matches
@entity96 fielded just 17 in four games , @entity16 and @entity100 18 in five
@entity12 , the original ' @entity13 ' , appointed on september 18 , 2000
@entity0 has used one goalkeeper , six forwards and nine defenders
he has used 26 in @entity18 alone , three more than any other side
the @entity6 has also played an incredible 17 different midfielders
@entity199 and @entity201 yet to play this season so it could reach 35
