by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 07:23 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 12:06 est , 28 march 2013 thousands of people with kidney cancer that has spread are to be denied a new pill that could prolong their lives , claim doctors			1
axitinib extends the lives of advanced kidney cancer sufferers by two months on average , according to trials			1
but the drug is the latest to face an @entity16 ban by the rationing watchdog , the @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
it has already axed another drug that could be used after treatment stops working and the cancer starts growing again			2
banned : axitinib extends the lives of advanced kidney cancer sufferers by two months on average , according to trials professor @entity26 , consultant oncologist at @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ‘ this is very bad news for the thousands of patients across @entity31 and wales who could benefit from treatment with axitinib			1
‘ what will it take for @entity17 to approve a treatment in this setting ? ’ professor @entity26 said it was one of a new generation of drugs that cut off the blood supply to tumours which promise to extend life far more than trial data suggests			1
he said : ‘ in the seven years since i started working in kidney cancer , average life expectancy has more than doubled from 12 months to 30 months because we can treat continuously with different drugs			2
‘ but restricting the drugs we can offer , particularly after first - line treatment has failed , means we are losing the benefits			0
indeed it may mean we are wasting money on drugs at an earlier stage because we ca n’t provide maintenance therapy that gives patients a longer life and better quality of life			0
’ @entity22 , also known as @entity22 , targets molecules on tumour cells that help stimulate blood vessel growth			0
with their supply of oxygen and nutrients cut off , tumours eventually starve and die			0
altogether 9,000 people are diagnosed with kidney cancer each year , including one - third which has spread because of lack of symptoms in the early stages			2
the average age is 55 years			0
almost two in three might be eligible for the new drug when first - line treatments stop working			0
broadcaster @entity79 , chairman of the @entity80 and a kidney cancer survivor , says the decision is unacceptable however , a draft decision by @entity17 says axitinib is not a ‘ cost effective use of limited @entity16 resources ’ at around £ 3,000 a month			1
it previously banned everolimus for the same stage of the disease			0
broadcaster @entity79 , chairman of the @entity80 and a kidney cancer survivor , said : ‘ the @entity80 considers as unacceptable the decision by @entity17 not to approve axitinib as a second - line treatment for patients with advanced kidney cancer			1
’ dr @entity98 , medical director of the drug manufacturer @entity99 , said : ‘ @entity99 is extremely disappointed and saddened by today ’s decision			0
@entity99 has worked closely with @entity17 and done everything in its power to demonstrate the value axitinib brings to patients and address the questions about cost effectiveness raised by @entity17			2
‘ we remain deeply committed to the field of kidney cancer and believe that @entity22 is an important treatment advance that represents good value to the @entity16			1
we will continue to challenge this decision in the interests of patients			0

@entity17 says that the @entity16 should not provide axitinib
the drug can extend the lives of people with advanced kidney cancer but has been deemed not ' cost effective '
it works by cutting off the blood supply to the tumour
