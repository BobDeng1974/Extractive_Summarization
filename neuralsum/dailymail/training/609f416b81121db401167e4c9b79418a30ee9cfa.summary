@entity0 is living , breathing proof , of the benefits of @entity3 , the ' wonder drug ' which is giving real hope to @entity7 sufferers			1
more than a million people in @entity9 carry the @entity7 gene and a child is born with the disease every four days			1
it is the most common , life - shortening genetic illness			0
when he began the trial at the @entity18 in @entity20 's west , @entity0 , 12 , was in serious physical trouble - his lung function had dropped in the 40 per cent range			1
@entity0 performs a lung function test at the @entity18			1
his mother @entity25 insists he has improved dramatically in just two months on the revolutionary drug @entity3 ( @entity27 ) @entity0 ' lung function is nearing 90 per cent now , after just two months on the trial at the @entity32 , almost double what it was a few weeks ago regular visits to the @entity7 clinic in hospital are required to keep @entity0 and other @entity7 patients well enough to do the simple things like attend school the @entity0 family on an all - too - regular visit to hospital			1
both @entity44 ( front ) and older brother @entity42 have @entity7 as luck would have it , the only reason the @entity47 student in northern @entity48 was able to take part was when one of the 20 participants dropped out			0
' i was horrified to think why someone had to drop out , ' said his mum @entity25			0
but the dramatic improvement after just two months in the trial has provided the @entity60 with great hope for the future because their daughter @entity44 , 8 , also has @entity7 ' it 's been a long and amazing few weeks and tuesday marked two months of @entity3 ( treatment ) for @entity0 , ' she said			1
' it 's a miracle , it 's the closest thing we will get to a cure for @entity7 i think , a real breakthrough			2
' his health was really bad , i had a little boy who was pale and tiny and he 'd miss weeks at a time from school , since he 's been taking it he has n't missed a single day through sickness			2
' ' his health was really bad , i had a little boy who was pale and tiny and he 'd miss weeks at a time from school , since he 's been taking it he has n't missed a single day through sickness ' said @entity0 ' mum @entity81 infections caused by bacteria in the lungs can lead to lengthy hospital stays for @entity7 patients like @entity0 the range of medications and pieces of medial equipment @entity0 needs to use to treat his cf researchers say that @entity3 is able to treat the underlying cause of @entity7 by helping ' unlock that gate ' and restore the function of the @entity96 protein			1
other cf treatments have focused on symptoms only @entity3 ( or @entity3 ) is a pill taken twice a day for the treatment of @entity7 in people ages 6 and older with the @entity103 mutation			1

there are more than 1000 known mutations of the @entity7 gene			1
this helps improve lung function and lower sweat chloride levels and helps patients gain weight , all indicators that the drug is working			1
the defective gene in @entity7 leads to a build - up of thick mucus in the lungs , pancreas and other organs			2
when the lungs become clogged , it makes it very difficult to breathe but also traps bacteria in the airways			0
this can lead to infections and inflammation often causing severe lung damage , and eventually , respiratory failure			0
pancreatic problems are ever - present also , with the mucus preventing the release of digestive enzymes that help the body break down food and absorb important nutrients			0
@entity7 is considered just as deadly as heart disease and cancer but there are no outwardly visible signs someone is suffering the condition			2
researchers say that the @entity3 drug is able to treat the underlying cause of @entity7 by helping ' unlock that gate ' and restore the function of the @entity96 protein			1
this allows for a proper flow of salt and fluids on the surface of the lungs			0
this helps to thin the thick , sticky mucus caused by @entity7 ready for another check - up			2
@entity0 puts on a brave face as he gets set to undertake more treatment for @entity7 @entity25 looks back at the birth of her second child , @entity44 , eight years ago and admits what she and husband @entity167 were told , broke their hearts			1
' they told us to take her home and love her and that we 'd probably not have her for long			0
' within a few weeks the couple would learn both their children had @entity7			2
i already knew how serious a condition it is , i had a friend who had @entity7 , we grew up together and she passed away at a young age , ' she said			2
' but i ca n't believe how much our lives have changed in two months			0
' @entity0 lung function is now at 87 per cent - that is the highest it has been in his life			1
' just a few months ago , @entity0 was doing it tough , his lung function had fallen to 47 per cent			1
but things have turned markedly			0
his weight gain is also significant			0
' it 's astronomical - his last weight on tuesday ( at hospital ) showed he has put four kilos in just two months , ' his mum added			2
' that is huge for @entity42			0
he has so much energy and for the first time ever is looking for food in the middle of the night			0
' his chest x-ray is the best it has ever been			0
he is a different little boy and we can not be happier and more excited for his future			0
' a few weeks ago some of the mums got together for a game of netball in 35 degree heat and @entity0 was playing with us			2

' ' let 's do this ! ' @entity0 has been part of a trial of the @entity215 and his improvement since taking the little blue pill has stunned his family the @entity218 recently approved the drug for listing on the @entity220 ( @entity220 ) , helping at least 250 @entity9 affected by the @entity103 gene mutation			1
' the @entity220 subsidy of this medicine , which would otherwise cost approximately $ 300,000 a year per patient , will bring great relief to the patients and the families of people affected by this life threatening condition , ' said health minister @entity230			0
' with this new treatment many patients can experience an improved quality of life with reductions in respiratory and gastrointestinal complications , improved lung function and fewer hospitalisations			2
' sister and brother @entity44 and @entity0 both have @entity7 but the advent of @entity3 treatment in @entity9 has given them and their family real hope for the future @entity0 leaves hospital after more treatment for his @entity7			1
by taking @entity3 twice daily he has dramatically improved his lung function which was seriously low just two months ago @entity3 is also being used in a phase 2 clinical trial targeting the most common @entity252 mutation , in combination with another oral medication , @entity255			1
