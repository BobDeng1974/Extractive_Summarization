@entity0 is currently lighting up the @entity1 with his skills , flair and dribbling ability			1
he is arguably the favourite for the @entity7 award			1
and it also turns out that the in - form @entity10 winger is the most fouled player in the league this season , with opposing players being penalised 74 times			1
that works out at roughly three times a game ; hazard 's twisting and turning is obviously too much for defenders at times			2
but who else makes the list ? @entity0 has been fouled 74 times so far this season - the most in the @entity1 hazard holds his neck during @entity10 's clash with @entity27 at @entity28 on wednesday night in stats provided by @entity32 , @entity30 starlet @entity29 is second after drawing 60 fouls so far this season			1
hazard and @entity29 's game provokes challenges from defenders , and are often too quick with their low centre of gravity , so their status at the top is unsurprising			2
@entity45 's player of the season so far @entity46 is also up there , but he is beaten to no 3 spot by @entity49			0
the @entity51 forward has drawn 52 goals this season to @entity46 's 47 , despite playing one less game than the former @entity55 man			0
@entity56 is also in the top 13 , as is @entity58 winger @entity57 with both being fouled 41 times			2
@entity60 ( 56 ) , @entity61 ( 45 ) , @entity62 ( 45 ) , @entity63 ( 44 ) , @entity64 ( 44 ) , @entity65 ( 41 ) and @entity66 make up the list , but hazard is the clear winner			0
the @entity70 has scored nine times this season and has added consistency to his game as @entity10 have opened a seven - point lead over @entity75 at the top of the table			1
opposing defenders have been penalised 60 times for fouling @entity30 starlet @entity29 this season @entity27 forward @entity49 ( pictured tussling with @entity30 's @entity81 ) is third on the list @entity83 picked up a yellow card for this foul on @entity45 's @entity46 , who has drawn 47 fouls he has been praised by manager @entity87 , who has also bemoaned the frequency of fouls on @entity0 on several occasions			1
' the first free - kick of every game is somebody kicking him , ' the @entity92 boss said last month			0
' he has fouls and fouls and fouls			0
i do n't see many yellow cards			0
sometimes a yellow card is a consequence of violent conduct , but i also think that accumulation of small fouls is also violent conduct			0
' the kid is suffering the consequences of that , but playing amazingly well			0
' @entity110 has praised @entity0 for his performances this season but says defenders target him in games			1

@entity0 has been fouled 74 times in the @entity1 this season
@entity10 boss @entity110 says defenders target him early in games
hazard is a *candidate* for the @entity7 award
@entity29 is second on the 13 - man list from the *2014/15* season
