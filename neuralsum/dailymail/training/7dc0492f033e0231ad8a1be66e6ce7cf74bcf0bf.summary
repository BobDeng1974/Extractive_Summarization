by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 4 november 2013 @entity2 : 08:40 est , 4 november 2013 scientists have revealed the optical trickery behind an ' invisibility cloak ' that has been shown to make a kitten and goldfish mysteriously disappear			2
in a video demonstrating the team of @entity12 and @entity13 researchers ' work , a kitten and goldfish are hidden from view using the ' cloak ' - which is not like the flowing material version worn by @entity18 but carefully arranged thin panels of glass			1
the cloak works by bending light around an object in the centre of a specially - designed glass construction to make it invisible to a viewer			1
the video begins by showing a kitten seemingly disappearing behind a cloak or tubular screen and then a goldfish swimming until it disappears inside a similar cloak so that only its wriggling tail remains visible to the viewer			0
researchers from the @entity51 , @entity12 and @entity52 in @entity13 have found a way to use light refraction to render objects invisible using their cloak , which is actually a cleverly - designed hexagonal array of panels of glass			1
a diagram to explain how the illusion was created			0
the scientists used light refraction to render the kitten invisible - which sits in the middle of an array of carefully - angled pieces of glass - designed to bend the light around the animal the goldfish in the video appears to disappear behind the invisibility cloak , leaving just its wiggling tail visible @entity73 , a researcher at @entity51 , told @entity74 that the light humans see bounces off an object before it reaches our eyes			1
' we found that if we could control the path of the light , we could make the object invisible			1
' he said this means that they have worked to make the light bypass the object they want to hide , but still enable the light to reach a human 's eyes			2
here the mystery of how the goldfish disappears is revealed			0
light enters the hexagonal ' cloak ' and when the goldfish enters , it bends around the object taken out of the goldfish tank , it is possible to see the composition of the invisibility device and its clever construction , which consists of carefully - placed plates of glass dr @entity73 said : ' when light goes through this device it disperses sideways and follows a certain path to reach the same point as if it did n't encounter any objects , so visually it seems that the object inside has disappeared			2
researchers from the @entity51 , @entity12 and @entity52 in @entity13 , made the ' cloak ' from glass as it is transparent , and does not need to be impregnated with expensive nanotechnology , as human eyes are not sensitive to light 's minute delay , @entity107 reported			1
@entity115 , team leader of the research at the university , said the invisibility effect is currently only apparent if one looks at the object from a certain direction			0
a diagram showing how the device works			0
when light goes through the device it disperses sideways and follows a certain path to reach the same point as if it did n't encounter any objects , so visually it seems that the object inside it ( the light blue hexagonal space at the centre of the structure , which is hollow ) has disappeared here , it is possible to see the beam of light bending around the hexagonal structure			2
it is this optical effect , which means the object at the hexagon 's centre ( such as a goldfish ) is hidden from view ' there are six angles from which objects can be cloaked , ' he said			0
the scientists said that they plan on working on the device to make it more effective and add more useable angles as well as making the ' cloak ' lighter			0
however , the device is more sophisticated than previous attempts that only work with polarised light or microwaves , which humans can not see			0
the team hopes that one day the technology can be developed to ensure that objects can not be seen from any angle and they claim it could have important security , entertainment , and surveillance applications			1
it might be some time until we can wear flexible invisibility cloaks - as seen modelled by @entity168 in @entity169			0
but the scientists hope their glass invention will have important security , surveillance and entertainment functions in the future the device , pictured here making part of a pencil invisible , is more sophisticated than previous attempts that only work with polarised light or microwaves , which humans can not see			1

researchers from the @entity51 , @entity12 and @entity52 , @entity13 use light refraction in a novel way
' @entity186 ' made of glass works by bending light around an object at its centre to make it invisible to a viewer *standing* in a certain place
the scientists hope that one day the technology could have security , entertainment , and surveillance applications
