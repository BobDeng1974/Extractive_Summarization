by @entity0 published : 14:06 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 5 june 2013 a new cancer drug for patients with the same faulty gene as actress @entity5 has shown ' impressive responses ' in a clinical trial , researchers have said			1
the potential drug , called @entity9 , targets dna repair in cancer cells and is designed to attack tumours that have been left vulnerable by genetic mutations			1
@entity15 genes were brought into the public consciousness last month after @entity5 , 37 , revealed she underwent a double mastectomy when doctors told her that her faulty gene - @entity15 - meant she had an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer and a 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer			1
faulty gene : @entity5 arriving for the world premiere of @entity25 , at the @entity27 @entity26 , @entity28			1
last month she revealed she underwent a double mastectomy scientists studying @entity9 found the drug was ' well tolerated ' by patients and showed ' excellent anti-tumour activity ' , the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) and the @entity31 said			1
the results of the trial - which was funded by @entity39 firm @entity38 and involved the @entity40 and several @entity39 institutions - were presented at the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) meeting in @entity43 yesterday			0
some 70 patients with a range of cancers , including ovarian or peritoneal , and breast , were monitored , and patients with cancers linked to @entity15 mutations saw the most substantial improvement			0
the researchers used different measures of the drug ’s effect on tumour instability and breakdown			0
one was a clinical score called @entity61 , which included a range of measures such as whether visible lesions , or cracks , appear in the walls of tumours after treatment			0
some 70 patients with a range of cancers , including ovarian or peritoneal , and breast , were monitored as part of the trial some 11 of 25 evaluable ovarian cancer patients with @entity15 mutations had a @entity61 - positive response to treatment , as did seven of 18 breast cancer patients with @entity15 mutations			1
signs of some clinical benefit were seen in several more patients , the experts said			0
brca mutations reduce cells ’ ability to repair their dna , and when inherited substantially increase the risk of developing a range of cancers , including breast , ovarian and prostate			2
no targeted treatments have yet been approved specifically for use in patients who have inherited brca mutations			0
@entity9 673 - which is yet to be given a trade name - is one of a handful of a family of molecules called @entity105 inhibitors which are under development for the treatment of cancer			2
@entity9 is one of the most promising @entity105 inhibitors being tested in clinical trials			0
professor @entity112 , from the @entity30 , said : ' patients with germline @entity15 - associated tumours have no targeted treatment options , and there is a real need for these to be developed			2
' our promising study showed that @entity9 , a potent member of a family of potential drugs called @entity105 inhibitors , had excellent anti-tumour activity			0
it ’s one of a range of new - style cancer therapies that target specific molecular defects in tumours and offer the potential of more personalised treatments to patients , including those with @entity15 mutations			1
