@entity0 is facing a major backlash from his own party – with one mp warning his opposition to strikes in @entity6 could play into @entity8 ’s hands			1
the @entity10 leader said he would back limited military action against @entity12 in @entity13 , but insisted conditions would need to be met for him to support raids in @entity6 – including a @entity17 resolution , which @entity18 has pledged to veto			1
@entity10 ’s education spokesman @entity19 resigned , saying she could not support air strikes			1
mr @entity0 said that it would be ‘ better ’ to have @entity17 backing , and his aides suggested @entity32 and @entity33 should plead with mr @entity8 to drop his opposition			1

but a string of former ministers lined up to warn it makes no sense to support attacks in @entity13 but not @entity6			2
former cabinet minister @entity67 said : ‘ allowing @entity68 to retreat across an invisible border , to them , which they control , into @entity6 and regroup is simply no answer			0
’ mp @entity74 said : ‘ are we saying we will take action against terrorists responsible for beheading a @entity79 citizen on one side of the border , but would not target them if they scuttle a few yards across into @entity6 ? ’ he said the ‘ genocidal ’ actions of @entity84 meant there was no need to seek the approval of @entity6 ’s @entity88 or his ally @entity8			1
he said : ‘ it is really important we do not give any impression that @entity8			0
has got a veto of any sort			0
’ @entity94 , another former minister , said : ‘ if the government ’s position is it is illegal or wrong to act in this way in @entity6 , then why is it not illegal or wrong for the @entity99 ? ’ former foreign office minister @entity100 said she was ‘ deeply troubled ’ by @entity79 standing on the sidelines			2
@entity10 said mr @entity0 was not ‘ blocking ’ action on @entity6			1
but with the prime minister wary of acting without @entity10 , many fear he is effectively wielding a veto by setting these conditions			2
former @entity10 defence secretary @entity107 urged both men to consider sending in combat troops			0
he said : ‘ i hope it does n’t come to that			0
but i think it would be a very great mistake to signal to our enemy in advance the limits we are prepared to place now on the sort of support we might be prepared to give			0

born in @entity138 , her family moved to the @entity139 when she was seven and she grew up in @entity140			0
the 39 - year - old worked as a researcher for former @entity144 mp @entity143 from 1997 - 99 , before joining the @entity146 think tank			0
in a letter to mr @entity0 ahead of the vote on @entity13 , ms @entity19 said : ' i understand the case that has been made and will not be voting against the motion			1
' but i am unable in conscience to support the motion and i will make a deliberate abstention			0
