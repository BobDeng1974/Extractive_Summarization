@entity0 has revealed how the @entity2 lap of honour after tuesday ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity5 was the emptiest moment of his career			1
@entity0 could not hide his pain as he spoke about the traumas of a season that reduced @entity12 ’s most successful club to an object of fun			1
‘ it ’s been a real difficult season , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ a club that should be challenging for league titles to finish seventh is obviously not good enough			0
and to see a man who , for the last eight years , has put so much confidence in me — to see him lose his job was probably one of the toughest days i ’ve had in football			0
difficult : @entity0 described the lap of honour after beating @entity5 as the emptiest moment of his career gone : @entity0 was heavily involved in the disastrous campaign under @entity30 boss @entity29 ‘ walking around the pitch after the @entity5 game was probably the emptiest i ’ve ever felt on a football field			1
i took the job expecting to be walking around the last home game of the season either challenging for a league title or parading a league title			2
that ’s what this club demands and we ’ve got to make sure next season we are doing that			0
’ it has been the fall of @entity29 that has particularly stung @entity0			1
‘ he has taken the majority of criticism from outside the club , but if you speak to anyone inside then we ’ve all got to take collective responsibility — from players , the staff , the coaching staff , everybody , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it was really disappointing when @entity29 lost his job because @entity59 him as a friend			1
as a player , i ’ve never experienced anything like that with a manager — maybe once with @entity64 at @entity12 , when he lost his job			0
‘ the thing we ’ve all collectively failed on is definitely that we have lost eight games ( in all competitions ) at @entity2 this season			0
not good enough : @entity0 , who has been helping interim manager @entity72 , blasted @entity73 ' unacceptable ' it 's a new dawn : @entity75 netted twice for @entity73 as they beat @entity5 at @entity2 on tuesday night ‘ if we played all our games away , then we ’d be champions			1
but we ’ve lost games at @entity2 against teams that we should be beating			0
that has been the biggest single failing			0
’ @entity0 ’s future , and that of the rest of the class of ’ 92 — @entity72 , @entity86 and @entity87 — is uncertain pending @entity89 ’s arrival after sunday ’s final game of the season against @entity92 but @entity0 is keen to stay on			1
‘ i do n’t know what ’s around the corner for me in terms of my own personal job , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but the season as a whole has just not been good enough			0
we ’ve got to make sure next season , whoever is in charge and whoever is coaching , that we get back challenging for league titles			2
‘ i want to be part of @entity73 ’s future , i ’m a @entity73 person , i love the club			2
‘ results aside , it ’s been an incredible learning experience at a club that i love			0
i want to be here for the rest of my life , being involved with @entity73			2
so that ’s my hope			0
