@entity0 has been told he must step up as captain when he leads @entity2 into the autumn tests and next year ’s @entity4			1
@entity0 will equal @entity5 as the second longest - serving @entity2 skipper when he wears the armband for the 28th time , against @entity9 on november 8			1
only @entity10 ( 33 ) has done the job more times			2
yet despite having emerged as the face of a brave new side that reached the semi-finals of the @entity4 three years ago , he must also now be its voice			0
@entity0 has been told to raise his voice as @entity2 skipper and take the next step as a leader @entity2 coach @entity22 ( background ) wants @entity0 's words to match his actions on the pitch @entity0 admits the role has not come naturally and he has gone about his job with the same methodical calmness as childhood hero @entity30			1
he has led by actions rather than words but @entity2 coach @entity22 , who has worked with legendary leaders @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , believes the next 12 months present a significant test of @entity0 ’s calibre			1
he said : ‘ for @entity0 , the challenge now is taking the next step as a captain			2
he has had that experience from 2011 and done it for the @entity43			0
he has established himself in that role for us in his own quiet way			0
cool , calm and collected , @entity0 admits the captaincy role has not come naturally to him ‘ but players and captains go through stages and we are looking for him to be more vocal and demanding within the squad			2
he has some great leaders around him , in guys like @entity55 , who did a fantastic job for us in @entity58 when @entity0 was injured			2
‘ but it is important for those leaders to be vocal and have an input for the squad to work effectively			0
it has been a criticism that we have been too quiet and senior players have not voiced enough of themselves			0
’ @entity0 will equal @entity5 as the second longest - serving @entity2 skipper when they play @entity9 wales face @entity69 , @entity9 and @entity58 next month and @entity22 estimates that they have ‘ thrown away ’ six wins over the @entity72 nations in the last four years alone			1
most recently , @entity2 let slip a 12 - point lead in the final nine minutes against the @entity58 in june and @entity22 said : ‘ those are the moments when you need your senior players to speak up			1
' we have made poor decisions in the last few minutes of games we should have won			0
so we will spend time watching the videos , recreating those scenarios and making sure we make better decisions under pressure			0

the match sees @entity0 equal @entity5 as the second longest - serving @entity92 skipper behind only @entity10
