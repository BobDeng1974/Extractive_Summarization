by @entity0 published : 04:50 est , 12 february 2014 @entity2 : 04:51 est , 12 february 2014 a new pest - resistant maize will be approved for commercial planting by the @entity6 in the coming months eurocrats are due to rubber - stamp the cultivation of the first genetically modified crop in nearly two decades , despite the opposition of 19 countries			1
a new pest - resistant maize will be approved for commercial planting by the @entity6 in the coming months			0
it will be the first @entity17 crop to be given the go - ahead since 1998 , and only the second to be commercially grown in @entity20			1
critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ‘ frankenstein foods ’ could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health			1
yesterday the representatives of 19 governments tried to block the development in the @entity30			0
but because of complex voting rules , it was not enough to stop the approval			0
now the application for commercial planting will go to the unelected @entity6 , which is legally obliged to approve it			0
@entity37 , @entity39 ’s @entity38 , voted in favour of the application - one of just five country representatives to do so			2
under @entity30 rules each nation is given voting points depending on their population sizes			0
to block the application the representatives of roughly 75 per cent of @entity20 population needed to vote against - but only 52 per cent did so			0
the @entity39 government is fiercely in favour of @entity17 food , despite strong consumer concerns			1
environment secretary @entity56 said last month that @entity20 risked ‘ becoming the museum of world farming ’ if it continued to oppose @entity17 technology			1
critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ¿ frankenstein foods ¿ could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health			1
here , activists against @entity17 crops tear up plants at a test site in @entity70 of the maize proposal , he said : ‘ if approval is granted , as it should be based on the scientific evidence , then it will be the first @entity17 food crop authorised for planting by the @entity30 for 15 years			1
‘ delays and blockages have been politically - motivated rather than based on evidence			0
’ the new crop - called @entity79 and developed by @entity81 and @entity82 - is unlikely to be grown in @entity39 because the insects it has been bred to resist do not live in the country			1
@entity87 commissioner @entity86 said extensive research had shown the crop , whose developers first applied for authorisation in 2001 , was safe			0
@entity92 said in a statement that the @entity30 had ‘ a legal obligation to itself , to its farmers and scientists and to its trade partners ’ to support the approval of safe new agricultural products			2
@entity30 authorities have only ever approved two other @entity17 crops for commercial cultivation - a different maize and a potato			1
the potato was later blocked by a court			0
campaigners last night said the @entity6 should not approve the development - despite rules which oblige it to do so because not enough countries had voted to block it			0
eurocrats are due to rubber - stamp the cultivation of the first genetically modified crop - maize called @entity79 1507 - in nearly two decades , despite the opposition of 19 countries			1
the new crop was developed by @entity81 and @entity82 but is unlikely to be grown in @entity39			2
a stock image of @entity120 corn is pictured @entity122 agriculture policy director @entity121 said : ‘ the @entity6 can not ignore the scientific , political and legal concerns voiced by a large majority of countries , by two thirds of the @entity127 and supported by most @entity30 citizens			2
‘ the @entity129 would very likely overturn an authorisation of this @entity17 maize in a legal challenge , as it did with the latest @entity6 approval of the @entity17 potato			2
‘ the @entity6 must learn from its mistakes and stop breaching the rules that help ensure the safety of what is grown in @entity20			2
’ @entity139 , head of policy at organic campaign group the @entity141 , said : ‘ recent research by the @entity30 ’s own safety authority has shown that the @entity17 maize poses a risk to certain species of butterflies and moths			1
‘ @entity17 crops do not benefit farmers , consumers or the environment ; only a handful of seed and chemical companies			0
’ @entity155 , director of @entity156 , said : ‘ @entity158 maize is unnecessary and unwelcome			0
despite 13 years in the application process , there are still too many unanswered questions about its impact on the natural environment and potential harm to human health			0
‘ now that 19 @entity20 nations have given a clear signal that they do not want @entity79 grown on their doorstep , we sincerely hope that the @entity6 upholds that view by rejecting @entity81 ’s application			1

if approval granted the maize will be the first @entity17 food crop authorised for planting by the @entity30 for 15 years and only the second to be grown in @entity20
the @entity39 government is fiercely in favour of @entity17 food , despite strong consumer concerns about the impact of ' frankenstein foods '
but the new crop called @entity79 is unlikely to be grown in @entity39
