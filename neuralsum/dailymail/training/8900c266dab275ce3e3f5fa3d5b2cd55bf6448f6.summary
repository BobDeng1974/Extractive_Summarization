from sister by @entity10 's oddball knits to @entity12 's loo roll holder headgear and @entity15 's condom shaped hat , there has been no shortage of bizarre looks appearing on the catwalk			1
but although some of the @entity20 and off - schedule designers have produced typically outlandish garb , other new talents , @entity24 for example , appear to have raised their game			2
the packed out show had a glittering front row that included the saturday 's @entity49 , actress @entity50 and presenter , @entity52			1
also impressing the critics was the collection from @entity55 , which wowed with its sand - blasted prints in delicate blush and blood red			0
meanwhile hotly tipped young designer @entity60 , showed a characteristically sporty collection made - unusually - from @entity62			2
more commonly found coating the bottom of non-stick saucepans , the designer nevertheless managed to use the material to produce neat two - piece skirt suits , along with several versions of his trademark parka			0
delicate : @entity55 's pretty sand - blasted silk print dresses also impressed the critics feeling blue : @entity60 's collection was dominated by cobalt @entity77 's a / @entity76 collection was a riff on sports luxe eco chic : @entity60 's @entity62 two pieces were a hit elsewhere , up - and - coming talent , @entity84 , referenced @entity39 's outlandish side by sending models down the catwalk in outfits accessorised with bizarre flower - filled headscarves			1
the unwieldy headpieces lent a folksy vibe to delicately pretty dresses , wearable chunky knit jumpers and neat wide - leg slacks			0
@entity84 later revealed that the inspiration for the collection had been @entity99 's epic film adaptation of @entity101 novel , dr @entity102			2
' @entity103 , who played @entity104 in the film , was my muse , ' said @entity84 , ' mixed with @entity101 folk costume , art and culture			0
' flower power : @entity84 's flower and fur filled headdresses certainly made an impression folk : @entity84 's collection was inspired by @entity101 art elegant : a jacquard dress at @entity84 practical : @entity84 's chunky knit jumper big seller ? these two odd looking coats by @entity12 are unlikely to have many takers and that is ... ? does anyone know what this bizarre contraption is supposed to be ? answers on a postcard ... @entity132 knits ! a truly bizarre condom shaped hat by @entity135 at the ones to watch show and some very odd knitwear from sister by sibling more bizarre headwear from @entity141 's @entity135 a strange cowboy / bobble hat hybrid by @entity135 is that a christmas tree ? more bizarre fashion from @entity135 baggy trousers ! designs from the @entity150 catwalk show			1
