the man who owns a quarter of @entity1 is talking at length about his plans for a comedy tour with @entity5 , why he turned down the @entity7 ’s request to appear on @entity9 ’ @entity8 and the technicoloured poncho he wears while sitting with fans at matches			1
he is responding to the suggestion that he may be something of a maverick			2
‘ it was actually the original working name of my book , ’ says @entity17 businessman @entity16			1
top - flight time ? @entity1 investor @entity16 owns a quarter of the club ‘ the whole thought of being a maverick is trying to do things differently from the way they were done before			1
’ that extends to his dress code , which is usually on the casual side			2
‘ early on at @entity1 , on one trip to @entity33 , the pressure was put on me to smarten up so we went into a store near the stadium to buy a tie			1
since then i ’ve been a little less concerned			2
i throw on the jumper and have some fun			2
’ @entity16 ( the @entity41 stands for @entity42 ) is a well - known figure in his homeland for his television appearances and charity work and he may be about to earn fame in @entity48 , with @entity1 one win away from the @entity50			1
he will be at @entity51 on saturday and is promising to bring the pink - blue - red hoodie as he divides 90 minutes or more between fellow owners in the directors ’ box and friends and fans in the stands			2
‘ i come over to one or two matches a year and i ’ve always worn that sweater , ’ he says			2
‘ i bought it for $ 22 in a market in rural @entity63 when i was backpacking a few years ago with my daughter			1
’ in charge : @entity16 ( left ) in his lucky poncho with chairman @entity68 that was his attire while sitting next to a 92 - year - old supporter during the 4 - 1 victory over @entity73 which booked a play - off final place for @entity76 ’s side			1
‘ he had been coming since he was eight , ’ says @entity16 , 56			1
‘ it ’s staggering we would have that kind of fan			2
he was sharp and lucid and gave me very specific advice			2
’ @entity16 , said by @entity84 to be worth $ 1.5billion , is one of a clutch of investors from @entity88 who bought @entity1 for around £ 50million in january 2008			1
his shareholding stands at 25 per cent , a similar level to @entity91 , who also owns the @entity92 , and slightly more than @entity93 , a @entity94 founder with shares in the @entity96			2
together they leave the running of the club to chief executive @entity100			0
@entity16 , who made his fortune in investment banking , remembers when the group took over with @entity104 at the helm and the team ‘ getting kicked unceremoniously out of the @entity50 with the worst record ever ’			1
he admits to making mistakes as the club struggled in the @entity109 — leading to supporters staging a protest over a perceived lack of investment			0

‘ we ended up writing cheques that were triple our original investment to keep the team floating			0
over the years we did nothing but buy high and sell low with the players			0
‘ the number of mistakes we made was almost universal			0
sometimes people have thrown mud at the wall , accusing the @entity132 owners of not caring			0
i smile and say , “ i ’m @entity17 ”			1
’ @entity135 ’s sacking led to @entity76 ’s arrival last september and his impact has @entity1 entering a match worth more than £ 120m in television money alone			1
‘ it was n’t until a few days ago that i saw the numbers and went , “ what ? ” ’ admits @entity16			1
‘ i had no idea			0
it was double what i was expecting			0
it ’s probably the richest game in sport in the world			0
it certainly does n’t happen in the @entity150 , the @entity151 , the @entity152			0
there is never so much on one game			0
’ @entity155 provide the opposition			0
@entity1 ’s £ 7.1m losses are within the league ’s @entity159 regulations but @entity155 face a fine of around £ 50m if they gain promotion after losing £ 65.4m last season			1
on the training pitch : @entity1 manager @entity76 prepares his side for the play - off final at @entity51 ‘ we ’re out - walleted in payroll but the @entity169 has proven that money does n’t necessarily buy you wins , ’ says @entity16			1
‘ we think @entity159 is right for the league , the fans , the players , we think it ’s good long - term , so we adhere to it			0
others that have n’t should be willing to pay the price			0
’ his colourful character as much as his business acumen led to a three - season stint on @entity17 ’s version of @entity9 ’ @entity8 and he was offered a job by the @entity7			1
‘ but they wanted me to spend four or five days in @entity185 at a week ’s notice			0
my life is so booked up , dropping everything did n’t work			0
’ there was , however , a filmed date with @entity17 tv personality @entity191 , from @entity192 of @entity193 — ‘ we built a wonderful friendship ’ — and time as an ice hockey referee at university			1

‘ i was presenting an award at an industry event and we met back stage			0
he and i have talked about the possibility of doing television together			0
‘ it involved going out on the road and doing stand - up comedy			2
i would introduce him for 15 minutes and he would do an hour - and - a - half			0
