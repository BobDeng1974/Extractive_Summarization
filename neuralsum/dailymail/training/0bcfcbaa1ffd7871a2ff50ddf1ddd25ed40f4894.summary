there 's just a few hours to go until @entity1 and @entity3 's reindeer in @entity4 are getting ready for their biggest job of the year			2
but much further south in @entity10 , the @entity8 's only free - roaming herd of reindeer do n't seem to have a care in the world as they wander across the snow - capped hills of the east @entity15			1
rather than calling @entity4 their home , the 150 - strong @entity16 can be found in two locations north of the border - and are now quite an attraction			1
forget @entity4 ... these reindeer are @entity10 : the @entity16 is @entity8 's only herd of reindeer , found free ranging in the @entity24 mountains in @entity10 @entity10 home : the herd rages on 2,500 hectares of hill ground between 450 and 1,309 meters and stay above the tree line all year round regardless of the weather hard - going : @entity30 , a @entity31 of the @entity32 , feeds the reindeer this morning battling heavy snowfall as she goes almost ready for christmas eve : reindeer were introduced to @entity10 in 1952 by @entity38 reindeer herder , @entity39 which has now grown in number around 50 animals can be found ranging the @entity24 while the remainder stay the @entity43 - some 30 miles away			1
this morning , @entity30 was pictured battling the elements to herd the beautiful animals as snow swept across the landscape			0
the reindeer were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by a @entity51 reindeer herder , @entity39			1
he started with just a few reindeer , but the herd has grown over the years			2
@entity54 : every reindeer regardless of sex or age grows a new set of antlers every year and they have thick winter coats for arctic life weather conditions : they have extra wide , splayed hooves so they can spread weight on soft snow to prevent them sinking tasty snacks : reindeer enjoy nibbling on edible mushrooms , lichens and @entity74 vegetation - not just carrots - and their calves are born in the spring it is currently held at between 130 and 150 by controlled breeding , with most deer being born in the summer months			2
an account of the introduction written by mr @entity39 is featured on the official website for the animals			2
in it , he says : ' looking across @entity85 to the @entity24 from the railway bridge at @entity87 on a cold morning in april 1947 , i was instantly reminded of reindeer pastures in @entity4			0
friendly : reindeer can be very friendly and enjoy following people about , however during the rutting season bulls can be threatening herding : in @entity4 dogs help with the herding of reindeer but at @entity98 in @entity10 they are controlled by voice and titbits ' in 1952 , i brought some of my @entity51 mountain reindeer to @entity10 as an experiment , to show that they could live and breed in these surroundings			1
' official difficulties which had caused delay were overcome mainly through the interest shown by the press and the influence of the @entity110 of the @entity8			0
' the animals are tame and are often drafted in to pull sleighs during the months of november and december			0
uses : reindeer are bred for meat and clothes can be made from the skin or hide			0
reindeer hair is often used for weaving into expensive dress materials @entity3 's little helper : the hard - working animals are all tame and regularly appear at festive gatherings throughout the winter months in winter , a daily visits to the herd departs from the @entity125 in @entity98 - with guides taking visitors to the animals			1
some of the friendlier reindeer have been known to search through rucksacks and follow visitors around on their tour			0
in the winter months , teams of reindeer are rounded up to visit @entity1 parades around the country - hopefully getting everyone in the festive spirit			0
the hard - working creatures also appear at certain promotional events and even work in film studios			0
running free : the herd - which have also featured in numerous films and television shows - is kept at around 150 by controlled breeding			1

the 150 - strong @entity16 are the @entity8 's only free - roaming herd based in the east @entity15
the reindeer were re-introduced into the area in 1952 by a @entity51 reindeer herder @entity39
