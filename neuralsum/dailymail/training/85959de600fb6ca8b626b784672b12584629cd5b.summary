thousands of @entity1 passengers are stranded again for a second day after a power outage was claimed to have brought the @entity3 to a halt			1
travellers were hoping to take journeys they abandoned yesterday after the route was shut by a lorry fire , causing chaos and triggering compensation bills running into the millions			1
but just as services were back up and running , 11 more @entity1 trains with room for up to 8,000 people were cancelled			1
@entity1 appeared to blame operator @entity15 - which issued a heated denial			1
cancelled : another 11 @entity1 trains have been cancelled after the firm claimed there was a problem with the overhead power supply inside the @entity3 which led to it being shut for two hours dispute : @entity1 appeared to blame @entity15 , which operates the route - but @entity15 denied it had experienced any power problems when called by @entity26			1
' no , we have n't , ' said a spokesman trains were already only running through one of the twin tunnels today , while firefighters inspected possible damage to the other from yesterday 's lorry fire			1
that meant trains were having to run close together in batches in one direction before the line was cleared for a batch running in the opposite direction			2
@entity1 said the only available tunnel had to be closed for two hours this morning after ' @entity15 experienced new power supply problems '			1
but a @entity15 spokesman told @entity26 : ' no , we have n't			2
we 've been running single - line services throughout the day as we said we would			1
' [ for @entity1 ] there were issues with having to manage the timetable			2
as far as our business is concerned we said we would run single - line services throughout the day			2
we have done that and we continue to do that			0
' the media are trying to create another event , another disruption , to services in the @entity3			0
' @entity1 , however , stuck to its version of events - saying it believed the problem involved overhead power lines inside the tunnel itself			1
queues : more than 100 stranded @entity1 passengers queued from 6am at @entity67 's @entity66 today as they tried to rebook onto a train today			1
many services were full as priority was given to previous bookings waiting around : thousands of passengers were again left stranded in the @entity66 terminal today @entity15 operates the tunnel itself and runs @entity75 , a car and freight service , through it			1
it is true that the firm 's timetable has not been disrupted today , because it was not running to a published timetable in the first place			2
instead passengers were told to turn up at their pre-booked time , to be put on the first available train			0
at one point there was a five - hour wait , according to @entity15 's website , up from a predicted 90 minutes this morning			2
by 5pm @entity15 passengers still faced a three - and - a - half hour wait for a train in @entity94 and a five - and - a - half hour wait in @entity96			1
six @entity1 trains from @entity67 , two from @entity98 and three from @entity99 were cancelled today			1
the cancelled departures from @entity66 were the 2.04pm , 3.31pm , 5.04pm , 6.04pm , 6.31pm and 8.04pm			0
the firm admitted some stranded passengers could face a second night away from home - with official advice being to avoid @entity67 's @entity66 altogether and book for another day			1
a spokesman said : ' @entity15 experienced new power supply problems this morning which meant that both tunnels were again closed for two hours			1
' this closure was a separate incident , unrelated to the problems experienced yesterday			0
' @entity113 couple @entity112 and @entity114 - whose train was cancelled yesterday - rebooked onto the today 's 5.04pm only to find it , too , had been wiped from the schedule			1
' we made five phone calls yesterday to get places , but now we are told we have to start the process again because our train has been cancelled , ' said mr @entity114 , 35			2
' i have never experienced anything like this			0
spending one more night here was okay , it was the weekend , luckily we could afford another night			0
' now we have come from the hotel with all of our luggage and baby things expecting to get on a train and they just say there is absolutely no way we are getting on another train			0
' now we have to spend money on a hotel			0
flights would cost us hundreds of euros and we would have to wait until @entity1 decides to refund us			2
they should pay for our bills			0
' i do not believe that they ca n't just put more trains on into the night			0
they say the service stops at 8pm - that is ridiculous			0
how are all these people ever going to get home ? ' calm after the storm : the scene at 8.30am beyond the check - in terminals as those stranded headed home @entity1 strongly advised passengers to come in person only if they were booked on a specific seat , with all trains delayed by up to an hour as one of the twin tunnels remained shut			1
more than 100 people defied advice to queue up at @entity67 's @entity66 from 6am to exchange yesterday 's tickets , only to be told the next train was full			0
but later the terminal at @entity66 was quiet as others appeared to have heeded advice not to turn up without a new booking			0
staff insisted more services would be running tomorrow , with engineering works planned to take place overnight to make more sections of the tunnel functioning again			1
' @entity1 plans to run a full service and passengers are advised to check - in as normal			1
' as @entity15 will not be completely operational @entity1 services may be subject to delays of up to about 30 minutes. , ' a spokesman said			1
but the company is facing a compensation bill running into the millions for the widespread disruption over the past two days			2
aside from the cost of refunding tickets and laying on an extra service at 8am today , it was offering passengers £ 250 - £ 50 for meals , £ 50 for taxis and £ 150 for a @entity67 hotel			1
one passenger , photographer and musician @entity194 , said : ' i arrived at @entity66 at 6:20am			0
there were around 150 people waiting to exchange tickets , but the service opened at 7am			0
chaos : thousands of @entity1 passengers faced queues yesterday for refunds and compensation which @entity1 trains are cancelled today ? @entity67 to @entity99 14:04 train 9136 @entity67 to @entity98 15:31 train 9036 @entity67 to @entity99 17:04 train 9148 @entity67 to @entity99 18:04 train 9152 @entity67 to @entity98 18:31 train 9048 @entity67 to @entity99 20:04 train 9162 @entity99 to @entity67 15:56 train 9145 @entity98 to @entity67 16:43 train 9045 @entity99 to @entity67 17:56 train 9153 @entity98 to @entity67 18:43 train 9053 @entity99 to @entity67 18:56 train 9157 will other trains run ? yes			1

if still stranded they should turn up today to exchange their ticket			0
' at 7.30am they told us that the first train from @entity66 to @entity98 was full , so they added a new train with 800 seats for all passengers that could n't leave @entity67 yesterday			0
' they were saying the train would leave at 9.05am			0
' services resumed on @entity15 at 2.45am @entity249 time from @entity249 and 4.30am @entity113 time from @entity113			1
empty trains were sent through the tunnel to ensure it was clear and customers were being offered transfers to ferries until the service restarted			0
previous delays on the car and lorry shuttle have forced @entity261 to implement @entity262 , lining up thousands of vehicles along the @entity264 as they wait for a departure			0
a spokesman said : ' it 's always in place ready to go but we are not expecting to have to do it today			0
' one witness claimed passengers were given gas masks yesterday after two of the north tunnel 's carbon dioxide alarms sounded at the @entity113 end just before noon			2
a ' smouldering load ' was found on board a truck which was being carried in one of the vehicle shuttles , and although the fire was not serious the tunnel is still being checked for damage			0
huge queues built up at @entity66 as services were cancelled and similar scenes were reported in @entity98 , with many holidaymakers forced to look for alternative transport or hotels			0

' all passengers who are booked to travel today ( sunday 18 january ) should check - in as normal half an hour before departure			2
