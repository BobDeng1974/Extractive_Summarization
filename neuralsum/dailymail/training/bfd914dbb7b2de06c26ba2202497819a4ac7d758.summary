new emails released in the @entity2 hack seem to illustrate the very big role the husband of studio head @entity5 played in her decision making on the job			1
there was much speculation as to why @entity2 fired their head of communications , @entity12 , this november , just 15 months after he started on the job , and now an email exchange between @entity15 and @entity16 , her husband , sheds some possible light on the situation			1
it seems that after @entity15 was not invited to attend an executive roundtable hosted by @entity22 , @entity16 told her to get rid of @entity12			1
' he then adds , ' or at least tell him you â€™re not going to deal with him anymore			0
' @entity15 was the only head of a major studio not on hand for the event			2
shockingly , @entity15 then forwarded the email to @entity51 , the head of human resources at @entity2 , who responds by saying ; ' he 's right			1
' six days later , @entity12 was out of a job			0
making matters worse , the executive roundtable , which is held every year , is usually meant to be a discussion of the films from each studio that could possibly be contenders during awards season , and @entity2 has numerous films expected to garner nominations in major categories at this year 's @entity65			1
the studio just received eight @entity67 nominations between @entity2 and @entity68 , and will likely have one major @entity65 contender across the board in the @entity72 drama @entity73			2
@entity75 's @entity74 , @entity77 's @entity76 , @entity79 ' @entity78 , @entity81 's @entity80 , @entity83 ' @entity82 and @entity85 ' @entity84 were invited to the event			0
cool kids : @entity81 's @entity80 , @entity79 ' @entity78 , @entity75 's @entity74 , @entity85 ' @entity84 , @entity83 ' @entity82 and @entity77 's @entity76 attended the executive roundtable @entity15 commented on this recent leak by saying the roundtable incident had nothing to do with the decision to terminate @entity12			2
others who have been slighted by @entity15 in leaked emails this week include president @entity95 , who was the subject of a racist exchange between her and producer @entity98 , and writer @entity99 , who she called ' broke ' before alleging he only wanted to adapt a book because he was sleeping with the writer			0
@entity105 spokesperson @entity104 said on friday that he felt an apology from @entity15 and @entity2 was ' appropriate			0
' @entity12 and @entity16 have yet to comment on these most recent emails .			0

@entity16 , the husband of @entity2 chair @entity5 , suggested his wife fire the *company* 's head of communications , @entity12
this after @entity15 was not invited to be a guest at @entity22 's annual roundtable of executives
most executives at the roundtable have films expected to *factor* in the @entity65 race that year , and @entity2 has a major contender in @entity73
@entity15 forwarded her husband 's email to the head of human resources at @entity2 , and six days later @entity12 was fired
@entity15 has denied the roundtable incident had anything to do with the firing of @entity12
