volcanic eruptions may be behind the slowdown in global warming over the past 15 years , a study claims			1
@entity5 scientists believe small volcanoes are spewing sulphur aerosols into the upper atmosphere that reflect sunlight away from the @entity10			1
researchers have long known that volcanoes can protect against global warming , but they did not think that minor eruptions did much to the atmosphere			1
new research shows that eruptions of this size may contribute more to the recent lull in global temperature increases than previously thought the latest findings , by researchers at @entity24 , show that small volcanic eruptions have deflected almost twice the amount of solar radiation previously estimated			2
' by knocking incoming solar energy back out into space , sulphuric acid particles from these recent eruptions could be responsible for decreasing global temperatures by 0.05 to @entity33 ( 0.09 to 0.22 ° f ) since 2000 , ' said the study			1
' these new data could help to explain why increases in global temperatures have slowed over the past 15 years , a period dubbed the " global warming hiatus "			1
' the warmest year on record was in 1998 , and although recent years have been warmer than the 20th century average , the steep climb seen in the 1990s has levelled off			0
in april , the @entity43 said it is ' 95 per cent ' certain that climate change is man made , but still could not explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years			1
now researchers claim its due to volcanic eruptions			0
pictured is the change in average sea surface temperatures from 1901 - 2012 a number of theories exist on why the globe is experiencing a warming hiatus , including changes in the way heat is absorbed by the ocean or a period of weak solar activity			1
instead of eruptions , some scientists claim one of the causes of the ‘ plateau ’ in sea - surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water			0
they believe this exchange is occurring between warm , surface waters and cold , deep waters below 2,300ft ( 700 metres ) – as if the warming is ‘ hiding ’ underwater			0
@entity77 trade winds of the @entity78 have increased significantly over the past two decades and as a result are blowing higher volumes of warm surface sea water to deeper depths			0
stronger trade winds blowing from @entity85 to @entity86 have had the net effect of cooling surface temperatures by a global average of between 0.1 ° c and 0.2 ° c , this would be enough to account for the apparent hiatus in global average temperatures over the past 15 years			1
the warm water wo n’t hide below the surface forever : scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators , such as sea level or ocean circulation			0
but most climate projections do not factor in volcanic eruptions because they are so hard to predict			0
however , large ones like the 1991 @entity103 eruption in the @entity104 , which emitted some 44 billion lbs ( 20 million metric tons ) of sulphur , are believed to have impacted global climate			2
@entity107 , an atmospheric scientist at @entity24 in @entity108 , felt that a piece of the climate puzzle was missing			0
according to the study , he located it in the intersection of the stratosphere and the troposphere - the bottom layer of the atmosphere - where all weather takes place			1
the two layers meet between six to nine miles ( 10 and 15km ) above the @entity10 , and are below the reach of most satellites			2
' the satellite data does a great job of monitoring the particles above nine miles ( 15km ) , which is fine in the tropics , ' professor @entity107 said			0
' however , towards the poles we are missing more and more of the particles residing in the lower stratosphere that can reach down to six miles ( 10km )			2
' the study combined observations from ground , air and space - based instruments to better observe aerosols in the lower portion of the stratosphere , and found that there are more aerosols that previously thought			1
experts say future climate models need to incorporate better aerosol data , which can only be obtained with a more robust monitoring system for stratospheric aerosols			2
the latest findings , by researchers at @entity24 , show that small volcanic eruptions have deflected almost twice the amount of solar radiation previously estimated			0

small volcanoes are spewing sulphur aerosols into upper atmosphere
these aerosols reflect huge amounts of sunlight away from the @entity10
this may be responsible for decreasing temperatures by 0.05 to 0.12 ° c
data could explain why global warming has slowed over past 15 years
