in a moving interview , the 60 - year - old revealed that she has no independence at her @entity11 nursing home , where none of her fellow residents come near her			1
' unfortunately , there 's not a whole lot i can do , ' she told the @entity17			2
' i 've lost so much independence ... i could change my own truck tire , and now i canâ € ™ t even feed myself			1
' @entity21 's life forever changed in 2009 when she was attacked by a friend 's chimp , @entity23 , in @entity25 , @entity26			1
she remembers none of the attack that claimed her eyes , nose , lips and hands			1
in 2011 , she underwent a full face transplant at @entity34 and @entity37 - the hospital 's third - and was fitted with glass eyes			1
a hand transplant was unsuccessful			2
she has now spoken out about how she struggles with her loss of independence most recently , she was fitted with teeth that allow her to chew tougher foods , such as chicken			1
when she spoke with the @entity17 , her speech was intentional and clear			0
' itâ € ™ 's very hard to live			2
not even live - half - live , ' @entity21 said			2
' sometimes you want to cry , you want out , you want some kind of home			0
i do n't know what my future is , that 's the scary part			0
' now her days consist of listening to audio books and walking the hallways of the nursing facility			1
she also practices facial expressions and is slowly getting used to her new teeth			0
' they just made some bottom teeth for me recently , ' she said			0
' i 'm not used to them yet			0
it 's still a little bit of work eating			0
saved : she underwent a face transplant in 2011 and was fitted with glass eyes			1
she recently got a new set of bottom teeth , which she says she is still getting used to injuries : she was left with a thumb on one hand and lost the other hand between her wrist and elbow ' i ca n't chew steak			2
i can chew chicken , it 's a little softer			0
the crust is hard , but the pizza is ok			0
i 'm starting to get back into eating salads again			0
that was my favorite , salads			0
' she hopes that one day she will be able to live at home instead of a facility			2
in the nursing home , she says that the staff and residents keep their distance , perhaps out of fear			1
she said that it 's tough that the staff and residents are n't making the situation easier for her , but that she 's determined to get on without their encouragement			1
' i 've never been a quitter , ' said @entity21 , who bought up her daughter , @entity102 , on her own			0
violent : @entity21 , pictured before the attack ( right ) , was attacked by her friend 's chimp @entity23 ( left ) in 2009 life changing : an illustration , left , shows how @entity21 's face was damaged in the attack - she lost her eyes , nose and lips			1
but the transplant , right , gave her back these features intense : a team of more than 30 physicians , nurses , residents and other clinical staff are pictured at work during the 20 hour procedure at @entity34 in @entity123 she also hopes to use her story so that others do n't have to face a similar ordeal , and is working with advocates on a video to encourage stronger laws restricting exotic animals			1
she said she never felt at ease with @entity23 being locked up in her friend 's home			1
the friend , @entity135 , died of an aneurism in 2010			0
' i remember looking at him in his cage and feeling sorry for him , ' she said			0
' my thoughts were always , " how is she allowed this animal in her house ? what if he gets loose someday and somebody gets hurt ? " i know the animals are cute - but they 're just not pets			0
' after the attack , her family sought permission to sue @entity26 for $ 150 million for failing to seize the animal before the attack			2
but the state claims commissioner died permission , saying that state law did not prohibit the private ownership of chimpanzees at the time of the attack			0
after the transplant : she underwent a face transplant in 2011 , pictured , and was given glass eyes new life : @entity21 is pictured at the @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity26 in 2012 see below for video			1

but she struggles with her loss of independence at a @entity11 nursing home - where the staff and residents keep their distance
she spends her days listening to audio books , walking the hallways and hoping that one day she will be able to return to a home
