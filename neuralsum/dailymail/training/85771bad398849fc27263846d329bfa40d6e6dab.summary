the first wednesday of august is known as ' black wednesday ' because it is the day that new junior doctors start work , and others move to different departments it is thought that people who are admitted to hospital as an emergency on ‘ @entity7 ’ are six per cent more likely to die than they would have been if they were admitted the previous wednesday , @entity15 reports			1
