by @entity0 a homeowner is preparing to do battle with his residents ' association after it fined him $ 200 for flying the @entity6 flag outside his house			1
@entity8 annoyed neighbours in @entity10 , @entity11 , when he hoisted the revolutionary - era standard with its 13 stars and stripes outside his townhouse in the run up to @entity17			1
slapping him with the fine , the @entity18 told mr @entity8 the only acceptable @entity21 flag is the current incarnation , which has 50 stars and 13 stripes			1
do n't tread on me : @entity8 outside his home in @entity10 , @entity11 , with the @entity6 flag still flying in the background despite his having been fined $ 200 by his homeowners ' association now mr @entity8 is planning to consult an attorney , who he thinks will back up his opinion that the association is acting contrary to the @entity34 to display the @entity35			1
it 's just the latest volley in a long - running dispute between mr @entity8 and his homeowners ' association			1
but he told @entity41 reporter @entity40 he does n't really want a fight over his flags			0
' i just want to honour our history , ' he said			0
the @entity21 flag has been redesigned 26 times since it was officially adopted on june 14 , 1777			0
one of its first incarnations , the so - called ' @entity6 ' flag that got @entity8 in trouble with his neighbours , had 13 stars and 13 stripes to represent the 13 colonies in the original @entity57			1
while its origins are not well documented , a popularly accepted legend is that @entity6 , the wife of a militiaman , sewed it from a sketch handed to her by @entity64			2
however at the time the design was by no means universally used , and a number of flags loosely based on the prescribed design were used in the early years of @entity21 independence			0
over the years more stars have been gradually added to the @entity21 flag to reflect the addition of new states to the union			2
the current flag has been in use since 1960 , when @entity77 was made a state			0
in april mr @entity8 , a flag enthusiast who owns 13 flags , was warned by the @entity82 for flying the @entity83 , the yellow , pre-revolutionary flag which proclaims ' do n't tread on me '			1
attempting to mollify neighbours , he took down the @entity83 - a favourite of @entity90 conservatives - and hoisted his @entity11 flag instead			0
in may , the @entity82 fined him $ 100 in response and he took down the flag , replacing it with the @entity6 , an early version of the current @entity95 that was first adopted in 1777			1
it is distinctive for the circular arrangement of its 13 stars - representing the 13 colonies that originally declared independence from the @entity102			2
but in june that drew another fine , this time for $ 200			0
this time , however , mr @entity8 says he wo n't back down , despite a letter threating further action from the homeowners ' association			2
mr @entity8 says he is growing disillusioned with the benefits offered by the association			0
' what are we gaining ? what are we losing ? ' he asked @entity41			0
' are we losing our freedom for a nice manicured lawn ? i really hope we are not			0
' the @entity6 @entity21 flag : while its origins are not well documented , a popularly accepted legend is that @entity6 , the wife of a militiaman , sewed it from a sketch handed to her by @entity64			1

@entity8 was told the only acceptable flag has 50 stars and 13 stripes
but he believes he has a right to fly the @entity6 under a 2005 law
he plans to consult a lawyer and will *continue* to fly the flag until *resolved*
