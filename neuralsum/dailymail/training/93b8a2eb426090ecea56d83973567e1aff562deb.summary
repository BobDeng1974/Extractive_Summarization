for more than 200 summers , the sound of leather on willow has echoed around @entity4			1
the club , one of the oldest in @entity8 , has had to suspend play following an unprecedented pitch invasion – by a colony of badgers			1
the animals have ripped up the pristine turf , turning 50 square metres of it into a mudbath			1
the usually - manicured grass at @entity4 has been destroyed by local badgers it means the @entity21 club , founded in 1787 , can not start the season			1
it has had to suspend play indefinitely because badgers are a protected species , so members can do little to get rid of them			1
they can only watch helplessly as the animals rip up the historic ground			2
in 1882 it hosted the @entity31 team that nine days later beat @entity8 at the @entity32 , the defeat which gave rise to the @entity35			0
chairman @entity36 said : ‘ i ’ve been at the club for 25 years and never seen anything like this before			2
we estimate that around 50 square metres of the pitch has been damaged by the badgers and because they are protected by law we are totally helpless to stop them			1
‘ the pitch looks more like the @entity47 as it is covered in huge holes and mounds of earth			0
it looks like someone has turned up with a mortar and tried to trash it			0
’ @entity55 , sett and match to the badgers : club officials believe a colony of the protected mammals is to blame happier times : this photograph shows how it used to look before the badgers staged their pitch invasion it 's just not cricket : @entity4 secretary @entity68 shows the damage that 's been done the badgers are believed to have been attracted to the turf by crane flies , which lay their larvae in the grass			1
usually the club sprays the ground to clear the insects , but it was too cold to do so this year			2
the treatment only works at temperatures of @entity81 to @entity82 ( 46f to @entity83 )			0
under the @entity85 1992 it is illegal to kill , injure or disturb badgers or to destroy their setts			0
mr @entity36 said : ‘ apparently the badgers really like the larvae and they have been tearing up large swabs of the ground in search of them			0
@entity4 played against the @entity8 team in 1882 on its pitch - and won this team photograph dating back to 1938 shows how the pitch has always been kept in perfect condition ‘ we have bought some sonic alarms to try to frighten them away , but they are proving totally inadequate and we are powerless to do anything else			1
‘ in the whole history of the club a game has never been cancelled due to badgers before			2
the badgers have churned up so much grass that it looks like we will have to re-turf the whole pitch , which will be really expensive			1
‘ at the moment we do n’t know when we will ever be able to play on the pitch again			2
’ the 226 - year - old club moved to its present ground , @entity114 , halfway through the 19th century			0
founded in 1787 - the same year as the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) - @entity4 may date back even further than that , as there are records of games held at the club as far back as 1760			1
initially based at the south end of the town , the cricket club moved first to @entity124 , now the grounds of the @entity126 , and then to its present site at @entity114 in the middle of the 19th century			0
the club owns a well - preserved score book covering the years 1881 - 1883 , and it includes details of the celebrated game between the host side and the @entity8 team which @entity135 won just days before the @entity31 beat @entity8 at the @entity32 in the game that gave birth to the @entity35			0
the following year , the @entity31 returned and defeated @entity135 by nine wickets .			0

manicured grass of @entity4 has been totally *shredded*
club officials are powerless to stop the animals which are protected by law
they say they ca **n't** *afford* to re-turf it so do **n't** know when they *'ll* play again
