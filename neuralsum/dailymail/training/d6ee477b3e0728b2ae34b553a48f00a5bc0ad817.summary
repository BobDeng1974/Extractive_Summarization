there is one vote of immense significance going on in @entity3 on thursday where nearly all of us can surely agree it would be best to hear a ‘ yes ’ verdict			0
here ’s one area where @entity9 and the politicians based in @entity11 are in total agreement			0
the @entity13 has been holding its autumn meeting on september 18 since 1783 but there might never have been a gathering as momentous as this			0
at this meeting , the result of the ballot on whether to allow women members will be declared			1
@entity21 speaks during her induction ceremony as the @entity24 honoree prior to the @entity25 at @entity26 @entity21 of @entity27 tees off on the 18th hole during the pro-am prior to the 2007 @entity30 held on the @entity31 at @entity32 since the alternative is worldwide ridicule — and the 2,400 men who make up the @entity38 membership are hardly fools — it is expected they will vote in large numbers for women to be allowed to join the club			1
thereafter , expect 15 or so women holding prominent positions within the golfing community to be sounded out and fast - tracked			1
in addition to high - ranking officials , let us hope the list includes popular ex-players such as former world no 1 @entity21			2
@entity51 , chief executive of the @entity38 , has spoken about a ‘ direction of travel ’ on this subject and it finally looks like the organisation has swapped a glacier as the preferred mode of transport for a speedboat			1
if the vote goes as expected , the next thing will be for other courses on the @entity30 rota with men - only membership to note that times have changed and act accordingly			2
@entity51 , chief executive of the @entity38 , has spoken about a ‘ direction of travel ’ on the subject for the @entity38 , the manner in which @entity70 at men - only @entity26 last year was overshadowed by the issue and the uneasiness felt all week by influential sponsors such as @entity75 appears to have been the tipping point			1
there is only one more open scheduled for a men - only club — @entity81 in 2016 — and it is hard to envisage the privilege being granted again unless the clubs in question change			2
royal @entity86 ’s is the other men - only club on the rota and the noises emanating from all three over the past six months indicate they are ready to follow the lead of the governing body			2
it took long enough , it ’s true , but thankfully it truly looks as if this great stain that has blighted the game for so long is about to be finally washed away			0
the @entity100 play - offs are horribly contrived and dreadfully unfair on the men who play well all season long			1
but , like the @entity103 play - off game in football that decides the final promotion spot to the @entity107 , there is no denying the format ensures an exciting end to the @entity112 season			1
the outcome was in doubt almost to the end at @entity115 on sunday before @entity116 got to the 16th and closed out the @entity103 with the greatest putt for par he will ever hole to deny the likes of @entity120 and @entity121 and claim his $ 11.44million payday			0
the $ 10m @entity124 bonus he received , in addition to the $ 1.44m first prize for the @entity103 , is the headline figure but the rest did n’t exactly go home empty - handed			0
@entity120 pocketed $ 2m for finishing third in the @entity124 standings			0
@entity131 earned $ 300,000 for being placed 11th			0
@entity133 was busy winning the @entity134 in @entity135 on sunday , but was still shipped another $ 75,000 by the sponsor for finishing 95th , after his participation in the first two play - off events			1
a wonderful life when you get to that level in golf , is n’t it ? @entity144 poses with both trophies after winning the @entity103 and the @entity100 quote of the week ‘ i ’m about ready to cry right now because , honestly , @entity148 is a hero			1
i ca n’t really explain how good it feels to beat his record			0
’ will @entity151 prove to be the next great @entity153 golfer ? the 19 - year - old has been making a name for himself in the @entity157 college scene and , at the @entity158 in @entity159 last week , broke a 72 - hole individual scoring record set by the @entity148 that had stood for 54 years			1
no wonder he was so emotional			0
the event itself was won by the @entity157			0
new parent @entity164 and enigmatic @entity166 @entity165 might have had a late change of heart but the @entity168 this week will still boast its strongest line - up since @entity170 hosted the @entity171 in 2010			1
true , there will be no one remotely as famous and powerful as the avid golfing leftie who showed up at @entity170 earlier this month			1
but , while @entity157 president @entity180 has moved on , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 , plus @entity179 captain @entity178 , have all decided the best way of tuning up for the @entity171 at @entity182 is by revisiting the scene of the last home triumph			2
it ’s a welcome change of fortune for an event that has been neglected for too long by too many			0
new parent @entity164 had a late change of heart about the @entity168			2

the result of the ballot on whether to allow women members at the @entity38 will be declared this week
the @entity100 play - off format ensures exciting end to @entity112 season
@entity168 this week will still boast its strongest line - up since @entity170 hosted the @entity171 in 2010
