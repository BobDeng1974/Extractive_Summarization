by @entity0 an ancient wine cellar , believed to be the oldest discovered so far , has been uncovered by a team of @entity4 and @entity5 archaeologists			1
the cellar , found among the ruins of a palace in @entity9 , @entity5 , dates back almost 4,000 years			1
it contains 40 amphorae - like jars , which each held 50 litres of sweet wine - and the residue left inside hints at the recipe enjoyed at the time			1
these 3,700 - year - old jars were discovered in an ancient palatial wine cellar unearthed by researchers at @entity9			1
the team worked in day and night shifts to excavate a total of 40 intact vessels during its six week dig the team of international experts believe the 2,000 litres of fine wine was made by ancient canaanites in 1,700 b.c. who flavoured the wine with cinnamon , mint , honey and psychotropic resins			1
professor @entity35 , chair of the department of classical and near eastern languages and civilisations at the university , said the team first came across a three foot long jug , which they named ‘ @entity42 ’			0
‘ we dug and dug , and all of a sudden , @entity42 ’s friends started appearing - five , 10 , 15 , ultimately 40 jars packed in a 15 - by - 25 - foot storage room , ’ he said			2
‘ this is a hugely significant discovery - it ’s a wine cellar that , to our knowledge , is largely unmatched in age and size			2
’ the group made the discovery at the 75 - acre @entity9 site in @entity5 - the ruins of a northern @entity56 city - and said the cellar held the equivalent of 3,000 of today ’s bottles of red and white wine			1
the cellar , found among the ruins of a palace in @entity9 , @entity5 , dates back almost 4,000 years			1
it contains 40 amphorae - like jars , which each held 50 litres of sweet wine , although only residue remains the wine ( residue ) discovered was made by ancient canaanites in 1,700 b.c. it was flavoured with cinnamon , mint , honey and psychotropic resins , which can act on the central nervous system to affect brain function			1
psychoactive ingredients have been used throughout history to alter one 's consciousness , for ritual spiritual purposes and as anesthetics			0
a scientist also found traces of tartaric and syringic acid , which are both key components in wine			2
the recipe was similar to medicinal wines used in ancient @entity89 for two thousand years			0
dr @entity90 , assistant professor of classical studies at @entity92 , near @entity93 , analysed the residue found inside the jars to identify what they were originally used for			2
he found traces of tartaric and syringic acid , which are both key components in wine			0
dr @entity90 also discovered compounds suggesting ingredients popular in ancient wine - making , including honey , mint , cinnamon bark , juniper berries and resins			1
the recipe is similar to medicinal wines used in ancient @entity89 for two thousand years			0
he said : ‘ this was n’t moonshine that someone was brewing in their basement , eyeballing the measurements			0
‘ this wine ’s recipe was strictly followed in each and every jar			0
’ the team of international experts believe the 2,000 litres of fine wine , was made by ancient canaanites in 1,700 b.c. who flavoured the wine with cinnamon ( pictured left ) , mint , ( right ) honey and psychotropic resins			1
they are analysing wine residues in a bid to recreate the recipe researchers will continue to analyse the composition of each solution and hope to recreate the flavour of the ancient wine			2
dr @entity139 , chair of the department of maritime civilisations at the @entity142 , said the wine would have been drunk by important guests			0
‘ the wine cellar was located near a hall where banquets took place , a place where the @entity9 elite and possibly foreign guests consumed goat meat and wine , ’ he said			2
‘ the wine cellar and the banquet hall were destroyed during the same violent event , perhaps an earthquake , which covered them with thick debris of mud bricks and plaster			0
’ the team also discovered two doors leading out of the cellar to the south and the west that may lead to additional storage rooms			0
they will present their findings so far at the annual meeting of the @entity171 .			0

a team of @entity4 and @entity5 archaeologists discovered 40 jars in a ruined palace in @entity9 , @entity5 , which date back almost 4,000 years .
each jar held 50 litres of sweet wine , which was *precisely* made by ancient canaanites in 1,700 b.c.
by analysing the residue left in the jars , a @entity4 scientist found popular ingredients used in ancient wine - making , included honey , mint and cinnamon
