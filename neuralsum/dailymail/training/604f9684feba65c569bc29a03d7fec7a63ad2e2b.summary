by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's trusted lieutenant @entity2 is believed to have considered his future with the deposed @entity6 champion in the wake of wednesday 's @entity6 quarter final letdown			1
with @entity10 having departed back to @entity11 there was still no official word from the @entity3 camp about how their discussions of friday had concluded , with issues still apparently to be resolved			1
@entity29 's influence in the recent career of @entity3 and his major successes tends to have been underrated as he has worked largely in the shadow of high profile figures like @entity34 and , for the past few weeks , @entity10			1
while he has got on well with the @entity11 former player , as @entity3 has done , a point of contention to said to have been the manner of her appointment			2
while @entity29 was kept in the loop throughout the process of @entity34 being brought in , he and other members of the backroom staff are said to have been taken by surprise that talks with @entity10 were as far as advanced as they were in @entity45			2
that has added to a growing sense of being under - appreciated , which may have been exacerbated by what happened on wednesday			0
while year - round @entity3 watchers will know that outbursts at his box are nothing new , the focus is much magnified at @entity6			0
fallout : @entity3 's quarter - final exit at @entity6 has led to him having to re-assess his team call : fitness coach @entity56 ( second right ) wants a clear structure in backroom team @entity34 would go out of his way to praise @entity2 's role in a team that is clearly under general evaluation by @entity3 as he plots how to get back towards the top after his ranking slides to number ten on monday			1
during the @entity67 's increasingly long absences towards the end of the partnership @entity2 , who last night denied he was about to jump ship , was the ever - present			2
his role remains vital as it is clear that , even if @entity10 continues , she does not want to travel full - time on the tour			0
for instance @entity3 is now keen to restart training soon in @entity78 and he would be expected to supervise that while she takes a holiday			0
he is said to want assurances about his role and stature within the team			0
other members , such as the influential @entity87 - based fitness trainer @entity56 , are also believed to be demanding that a clear structure is established going forward if @entity10 is going to be in for the long haul			1
@entity2 , a mild - mannered and genial former top @entity90 college player who is very well - liked on the tour , knows @entity3 better than anyone			1
as well as having a good tennis brain he understands the 27 year - old @entity95 's moods and rage for perfection and if he ever left it would be a major blow .			0
