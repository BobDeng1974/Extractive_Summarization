by @entity0 published : 13:26 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 13:43 est , 1 march 2013 @entity1 , mr @entity2 's mp , told the @entity3 he needs @entity4 to stay alive as the drug dilates his arteries to carry blood to his muscles a father - of - three faces an early death unless he is prescribed the erectile dysfunction drug @entity4 to treat his lung disease , a @entity13 mp claimed today			1
@entity1 told the @entity3 her constituent @entity14 needs the stimulant as he suffers from lung and cardiac disease			1
the 61 - year - old ’s doctors insist he faces an early death unless he is prescribed the drug , which is usually used to treat erectile dysfunction			1
mr @entity14 ’s arteries are currently too narrow and the drug dilates them so that they can carry more oxygen to his muscles			1
but @entity26 and @entity27 are threatening to withdraw treatment from mr @entity14 as it will cost £ 5,000 and the drug should not necessarily be prescribed , according to national guidelines			1
it is up to the discretion of individual @entity32 if they prescribe the drug			1
speaking in the @entity3 , @entity34 and @entity37 mp ms @entity35 said her repeated calls for meetings with the trust have not been answered			0
she said the cost of his inevitable hospital treatment without the drug would cost the @entity45 more money than the @entity4 itself			2
she said : ' here is a man who could die without this drug and the bosses at @entity26 and @entity27 can not even deign to talk to his mp			2
' mr @entity14 is a good man			1
he has an extraordinary medical history			0
he is a testament to our nhs but he needs a tablet that most people , if they are honest , think is a bit of a joke drug			2
it ’s not for recreational purposes , it is to stay alive and my local @entity45 would rather let him suffer than let him have the only drug that works on him			1
@entity4 helps by elevating the levels of the chemical that causes the tissues in the body to relax			0
the effects on erectile function were discovered accidentally - it was originally developed to improve blood supply to the heart in angina sufferers			1
it is prescribed for patients such as mr @entity14 , who have restricted blood flow , because it 's artery - widening properties mean blood can get to the muscles that need it			1
however its effect on the arteries can also have negative effects : patients who take the drug may suffer from flushed skin			1
it can also cause headaches and nausea			0
' it would cost thousands of pounds a day to look after him in hospital but they wo n’t spend £ 5,000 to keep him out			0
my local @entity45 has behaved appallingly to him and have treated me and my office with a basic lack of respect			0
' we all know the @entity45 is facing pressures that it has n’t had to face before , but in this case @entity4 is not a sex tablet , it is a life - saver			0
' speaking outside the @entity3 , mr @entity14 , a retired engineer from @entity26 , said he was angry at the decision to potentially withdraw the drug			1
his battle with the @entity45 started two years ago when he was prescribed viagra			0
it worked successfully , but then the @entity32 said it should be withheld			1
he managed to successfully overturn the decision and get a prescription for half the original amount			0
but the @entity32 is now threatening to withdraw it again			2
mr @entity14 said : ' i can not believe it			2
i feel angry because i have been working for 30 years and paid my @entity114 and income tax and now i can not get the medicine that i need			0
' my family is also very stressed as we are getting letters saying now i can have it , now i ca n’t			0
they are not sure what will happen			0
' you have to wonder what is the point of having professional doctors if you are not going to listen to them			0
they are educated people and are prescribing the medicine for a reason , they are not doing it for a joke or for fun			0
' public health minister @entity131 said it was the @entity32 's discretion whether he received the treatment health minister @entity131 said she would be happy to attend a meeting between the @entity32 , mr @entity14 and his mp , ms @entity35 , who represents @entity34 and @entity37			1
the minister said the government ’s health reforms to abolish @entity32 will mean gps have the final say when it comes to prescribing drugs to patients			2
but she said guidance from the @entity148 ( @entity148 ) , which stated @entity4 should not be handed out automatically for mr @entity14 ’s condition , meant that it was at the discretion of the @entity32 whether he received the treatment			1
ms @entity131 said : ' i have to say , looking at what i have been told by the @entity32 , ( mr @entity14 ) has been through all the sorts of processes that you would expect			1
' i have to hope and pray that in the course of all of that , and the various effective appeals he has made to the @entity32 , everything has been properly considered			2
' but it just strikes me that the most obvious thing that should have been done , has n’t been done			0
' nobody seems to have sat mr @entity14 down and explained things to him			2
' if there is a good reason , then he should be told that and if it is just the money , then again we know exactly what the problem is			0
' therefore what i am going to suggest is that those who might be listening , whether it be in this building or whether they are at the other end of a television camera , should sit down with this man and discuss the way forward for his treatment			0

his arteries are currently too narrow and the drug dilates them so that they can carry more oxygen to his muscles that need them
his local @entity32 decides whether to fund the drug and is now *refusing* to
