by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is thoroughly enjoying himself at the @entity3 , not just on the court but also with all the speculation surrounding who he might employ as coach in succession to @entity9			1
the @entity11 champion eased through to the third round with a comprehensive 6 - 3 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 victory over @entity15 ’s @entity14 in a manner that suggests he can go well into the second week			1
after the one hour and 56 minute victory he addressed what is the biggest sub-plot of his career right now and admitted that he has spoken to at least one woman about coaching him in the future			1
vacancy : @entity2 walks past empty seats in his box during his @entity3 second - round victory the day after @entity28 claimed , a tad disingenuously , that she spent three hours watching him play a @entity29 in the first round purely as research for @entity33 tv , @entity2 asserted he would not be afraid to go against convention and be coached by a woman			1
he changes his tune regularly about the whole matter but said on thursday : ' i ’ve spoken to a few people , male and female			2
for me i do n’t care			2
i do n’t really care whether some of the other male players like it or not			0
' i was coached by my @entity45 for a long time			0
there have been ex players around who have said ‘ oh your @entity45 should n’t be around or she should n’t come and support you or come to watch			0
everyone is entitled to have the team around them that they want			0
' some men might not work with a female , some men might work well with a female coach			2
it is just whatever your preference is and whatever your needs are			0
“ a lot of people have been talked about , and they are all very good , i like all of the people that have been mentioned			0
when the time is right i will make an announcement			0
' hovering : @entity69 ( back 2nd right ) watched @entity2 's @entity3 opener on tuesday far from ‘ having to put up with it ’ as he insisted , @entity2 is clearly liking the speculation			1
he could shut it down by declining to discuss it – like he does the topic of @entity78 independence for example – but obviously does not find it too much of a distraction			0
his mother @entity82 wants to see more women coaching in the professional game , and back in @entity85 on thursday talked of what it is like to be in a ‘ male - dominated world ’			0
' i think i came in for a load of rubbish talked about me because i was the mother of sons , ' she said at an event for the @entity94 with @entity95			0
' if i was the mother of daughters i do n’t think anyone would really have noticed me , or if i ’d been the father of sons			0
women in decision - making positions will make more things happen			0
' we are family : @entity2 poses for the cameras with his mother @entity82 after winning @entity11 last year her son ’s next opponent will be the @entity110 @entity109 , the world number 24 from @entity110 who will be quite different to the entertaining @entity15 affectionately known as " @entity113 "			1
@entity2 faced the dog on the @entity116 - shaped @entity115 , known as the @entity117			2
it is due to be pulled down as part of the redevelopment of @entity3 , which is a shame , as something the @entity3 has over @entity11 is the character of its outside courts in relation to those of the @entity127 , which are functional and soulless by comparison			1
the 27 year - old @entity129 said he will miss court one when it is gone , with the crowd tight in on the players and able to hear their every exhalation and , in this case , expletive , of which there were quite a few from the @entity15			2
happy man : @entity2 waves to the crowd after booking his place in the third round of the @entity3 as @entity2 pointed out : ' everyone picks up on the players who speak @entity144 but some of the stuff in other languages is a lot worse			1
' @entity109 is likely to employ better tactics than @entity14 , who could hit explosively but did not always use his brain			1
time and again , for example , he kept directing his second serve to the lethal @entity2 backhand and time and again it got drilled back past him			2
it was an assured display from @entity2 with quick starts to each set and some strong serves when they were needed , but the test of how he will really cope at a @entity162 without a senior coach in his box is about to come			1
eye on the ball : @entity110 's @entity109 is @entity2 's next opponent on saturday			1

@entity2 admitted he has spoken to a least one woman about becoming his new coach
former @entity11 champion @entity69 watched @entity2 in action in his @entity3 opener on tuesday
the @entity174 no 1 beat @entity15 @entity14 in the second round
@entity2 faces @entity110 's @entity109 in the last *32* on saturday
