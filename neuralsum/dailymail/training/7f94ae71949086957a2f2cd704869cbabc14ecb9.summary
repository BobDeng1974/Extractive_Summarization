this time last year , all was well at @entity2			1
@entity3 were a point ahead of @entity5 at the top of the @entity7 and @entity8 was looking good for the manager of the year award			2
@entity10 was on his game , feeding @entity12 and @entity13 with those measured passes through midfield			1
but the landscape has changed drastically as @entity3 prepare to face @entity17 at home on sunday			1
‘ everyone knows if we perform the way we have done of late against @entity17 we ’ll get beaten , ’ admitted @entity10			1
‘ when you have a strikeforce of @entity13 and @entity12 , they are capable of killing teams in 20 minutes			1
it ’s different this year and everyone knows that			0
’ @entity10 has said @entity3 must improve if they want to get anything from this season @entity10 congratulates @entity29 after the midfielder scores the opening goal against @entity32 @entity3 lie in 11th place , 18 points behind leaders @entity37 , who they have been drawn to face in the @entity39 semi-final			1
even in the moments after @entity3 reached the last four with a 3 - 1 win at @entity32 on wednesday night , captain @entity10 was on hand for a rather brutal reality check			1
last season they blew @entity17 away at @entity2 , scoring four times in the opening 20 minutes and eventually winning 5 - 1			1
this is a different @entity3 team , still adapting to life without @entity12 and the injured @entity13 , who has been forced to go to @entity50 for treatment on his troublesome thigh injury			1
‘ i think they were 60 - 70 per cent of our goals those two			0
you take them out of any team in the world and it ’s going to be tough and it has been , ’ said @entity10			1
‘ but i think this is where you find out what kind of players you ’ve got in the dressing room			2
it ’s time to roll your sleeves up and fight for the club and try to put it right as soon as possible and that ’s what we ’re trying to do			0
@entity10 lamented the loss of forwards @entity12 to @entity77 and @entity13 to injury @entity3 are currently 11th in the @entity7 , five points behind sunday 's opponents @entity17 @entity3 slumped to a 3 - 0 defeat against @entity82 in their last @entity7 outing ‘ we made mistakes against @entity82 at @entity86 on sunday and we got punished by world - class players , ’ he added			1
‘ the first half against @entity32 was probably as close as we ’ve come to last season ’s standards			2
‘ it ’s been tough to perform of late because we have n’t played well as a team , but if we keep giving everything we ’ve got then i ’m sure the good days are not too far away			2
‘ if we can get a big result against @entity17 and build on this , then i think we can turn it around			2
’ @entity10 does not agree that they have turned the corner after beating a @entity100 team			2
the pressure is still on and so it should be after seven league defeats and an unnecessary exit in the group stage of the @entity106			0
the scrutiny has been intense and @entity10 accused people of ‘ killing ’ the club during a wretched run			1
he made it clear that the criticism of his own performances hurts him , but accepts that is the life as a player or manager at one of the world ’s biggest clubs			0
@entity10 said it was important that players did n't hide on the pitch , saying they needed ' men out there ' @entity3 's captain claimed a win against @entity17 on sunday could help turn their season around @entity8 has to accept criticism will come his way as manager of @entity3 , says @entity10 ‘ it comes with the territory , ’ he said			1
‘ there was a stage when a couple of my performances were under par and i got a bit of stick			0
i ’ve got to accept it being captain of the club and @entity8 ’s got to accept it being the manager of @entity3			2
‘ if results do n’t go well , questions are going to be asked , criticism is going to fly , you take it on the chin and try to improve things			0
that ’s the only way			0
i know when i do n’t play well			0
i think every individual does , but collectively it has been tough			0
‘ for me i ’ve experienced it a few times during my career at @entity3 when it gets tough under certain managers and from the outside people are trying to kill you			1
we ’re at a big club , we ’ve got to take that responsibility			0
we ca n’t have players hiding , we need men out there			0
’ @entity164 has lost his place in the @entity3 side following a number of high - profile mistakes @entity3 's win against @entity32 was their first victory since they beat @entity171 on december 2 gerrard with manager @entity8 , who has been heavily criticised of late for his team 's performances in many ways this was @entity10 at his best , rallying the team and reminding them publicly of their responsibilities to the club			1
but with @entity3 seven points behind @entity182 in fourth place , @entity106 qualification appears a tall order for this team			1
@entity10 said : ‘ it ’s a tough question and it ’s going to be tough to do it			2
we knew it was going to be tough the moment we lost @entity12 and the injuries we ’ve had to @entity13 of late			1
everyone in the country knows the job to get in the top four becomes that awful lot harder			0
but we ’ll keep fighting until the end and if people are going to write us off , we ca n’t control it			0
‘ i tell players individually and i tell them in the dressing room			0
but if you ’re sitting in that dressing room and you do n’t know that the performance levels have n’t been good enough of late , you ’re at the wrong place			0
‘ all i can control is what goes on in the dressing room and try to help other players to perform well			0
but certainly , on the performance against @entity32 , there ’s still a chance			0

@entity3 face @entity17 at @entity2 on sunday
@entity10 says they will lose to the @entity212 if they do n't improve
he also said the tough run will show what kind of players @entity3 have
@entity10 lamented the loss of forwards @entity13 and @entity12
but @entity10 has not given up on *sealing* fourth place this season
