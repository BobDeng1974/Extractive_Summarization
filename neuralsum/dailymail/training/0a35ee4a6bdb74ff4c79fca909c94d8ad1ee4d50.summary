by @entity1 reporter @entity3 's alleged ' enthusiastic pot use ' in college and her husband 's mistresses are ' open secrets ' in political circles , according to the author of an explosive new book on the @entity11			1
' it ’s sort of surprising how much is out in the open , and yet how little is written , ' @entity13 journalist @entity12 , author of ' @entity14 ' , told @entity16			1
' it ’s not as though @entity13 reporters are n’t aware of @entity20 and his mistresses , it ’s that they do n’t cover it			2
it ’s not surprising that @entity3 smoked pot , but that nobody would call her out on it			0
the @entity11 are pictured at the @entity32 @entity31 100 @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity32 on january 4 , 2008 in his book , @entity12 quotes @entity3 's former law classmate who claims his friend was a keen marijuana smoker			1

explosive : @entity29 editor @entity12 has authored this book on the lives and careers of @entity20 and @entity3 @entity12 has told radar that while some of these allegations were open secrets in @entity13 , reporters ' go easy ' on the @entity11 in order to advance their careers			1
' as a reporter you know that if you do n’t have access it ’s much harder to do your job , so a lot of people fear for their access and do n’t write these things , ' he told @entity67			0
' they ’re worried they ’ll get shunned			0
especially in considering she might be the next president , why would you pick her off , and her people off right now ? it would n’t be good			0
' while @entity3 remains coy on her presidential ambitions , speculation is rife that she is likely to throw her hat in the ring			0
however @entity12 claims in his book that the public have the wrong idea about the @entity11 , which may hurt the former secretary of state 's presidential chances			1
' i think on the one hand @entity3 's often portrayed as cold and calculating while @entity20 was sort of a motive and this bubba - like figure			2
i found that the opposite is closer to being the case , ' @entity12 told @entity105 's @entity104			2
' so , @entity106 tends to be more cold and more calculating while @entity3 tends to have long - time friends and have actual relationships and is sort of a more complicated figure			0
' @entity12 told @entity67 that he still has more @entity20 secrets to spill which could derail @entity3 's 2016 presidential run : i ’m just gon na leave it at that			1
