by @entity0 an estimated 161 @entity2 soldiers have committed suicide so far this year			1
suicides among active - duty military have increased somewhat so far this year compared with the same period last year , but @entity7 officials say they are encouraged that more service members are seeking help through hotlines and other aid programs			1
@entity7 documents show there were 161 confirmed or suspected suicides as of july 14 , compared with 154 during the same time frame in 2013			1
the uptick was among the @entity17 and @entity18 , while soldiers and @entity21 suicides went down			1
the documents were obtained by @entity0			2
tragic : @entity7 documents show there were 161 confirmed or suspected suicides as of july 14 while the 2014 numbers are likely to change over time as each death is investigated , the slight increase this year is a reversal in the sharp decline in active - duty suicides last year , compared with 2012			1
according to the final report released tuesday , active - duty suicides dropped by nearly 19 percent in 2013 , compared with the previous year , going from 319 to 259			1
suicides among @entity32 and @entity34 members increased by about 8 percent , going from 203 to 220			1
the @entity0 reported preliminary 2013 numbers in april			0
@entity36 , director of the @entity7 's suicide prevention office , said in an interview tuesday that while there is always a concern when officials see the number start to go up again , it 's still too early to tell because things could change			2
she also noted that while often military suicides spike in the summer months , this year the number has gone down in the last month or so			2
alarmed by the steady increase in suicides over the past decade , military officials in recent years beefed up the number of programs and behavioral health specialists available for troops			0
@entity54 has n't found a definitive link between suicides and service members who deploy to warzones , and officials say that more often the deaths are tied to familiar , societal problems such as financial or job stress and marriage and relationship issues			2
@entity65 said service members are increasingly using the help programs			0
for example , she said there has been a 25 percent increase in the calls to the military crisis line			0
and a website for troops — www.vets4warriors.com — saw a 500 percent increase in visitors after a suicide prevention program linked to it was publicized in late may			0
' whenever we see people reaching out for help , ' said @entity65 , ' that 's a win			0
' she added , ' we 're happy when we see one person getting help			0
we 're happy to see that one person who needed us , found us and we were there for them			0
' according to the 2014 data , there have been 70 confirmed and suspected suicides by @entity91 soldiers ; 34 by airmen , 21 by @entity21 and 36 by sailors @entity65 and other military leaders said that increasingly they have found that programs are more successful at the unit level , and when service members can reach out — even anonymously — to their peers for help			1
according to the 2014 data , there have been 70 confirmed and suspected suicides by @entity91 soldiers ; 34 by airmen , 21 by @entity21 and 36 by sailors			1
in the same time frame last year , there were 81 suicides by soldiers , 24 by airmen , 25 by @entity21 and 24 by sailors			1
the total number for 2014 so far — 161 — is still sharply lower than the 200 reported by this time in 2012			2
military officials struggle to explain the increase in suicides among @entity114			0
but officials have noted that the citizen soldiers are generally scattered across the @entity2 , often in small or remote rural communities			0
many members of the @entity32 and @entity34 report for training about one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer			1
they also often do n't have quick access to military medical or mental health services that may be on bases far from their homes			0
that means the outreach effort by the armed services to address the increase in suicides may not always get to reservists in need — particularly those who do n't actively seek help .			0
