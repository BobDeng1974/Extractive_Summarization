@entity1 grandee @entity0 today insisted broadcasters could not empty chair @entity4 if he refused to take part in tv debates			1
the former cabinet minister said the @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 were not entitled to ‘ impose what they want on the political parties ’ and the prime minister was within his rights to ignore them			1
the former @entity8 chair @entity17 accused the broadcasters of using ' bullying ' tactics to force the prime minister into the debates and said they were in danger of breaching strict rules on impartiality			1
@entity1 grandee @entity0 today insisted broadcasters could not empty chair @entity4 if he refused to take part in tv debates @entity0 , speaking at a business conference organised by the trade magazine @entity30 , suggested that the broadcasters were acting as if they had more power than they did			1
but he said @entity1 leader @entity33 was also perfectly entitled to score political points over mr @entity4 ’s refusal to take part in the debates			1
the @entity1 peer asked if he would advise mr @entity4 not to show up for the tv debates			1
he said : ‘ i would n’t tell him to do that			0
i would say that there ’s an expectation that you will debate properly with others			0
voters feel they are entitled to have that sort of debate and comparison directly in front of them			2
' however , @entity0 added : ‘ i think @entity4 is entitled not to do that debate in the particular way that the broadcasters have described and the @entity1 is entitled to make him look and appear completely frit and chicken and force him to take a hit for not doing the debates			1
‘ what i do n’t think is that the broadcasters are entitled to impose what they want on the political parties and empty chair party leaders			1
‘ i do n’t think the broadcasters have that entitlement			0
they are at the end of the day broadcasters – they are not the @entity68			0
who elected them ? ’ @entity71 peer @entity17 accused the broadcasters of using ' bullying ' tactics to force the prime minister into the debates and said they were in danger of breaching strict rules on impartiality the @entity1 peer 's remarks come after @entity82 , who served as chairman of the @entity8 board of governors between 2004 and 2006 , defended mr @entity4 for refusing to take part in any debates during the election campaign			1
mr @entity4 has agreed to take part in one debate with six other party leaders – but has insisted it takes place before the official start of the election campaign on march 30			1
the broadcasters however have insisted the debates must take place in april – just weeks before the election – and insisted they would go ahead with or without mr @entity4			2
but the threat to empty chair the prime minister in the proposed head - to - head against mr @entity33 on 30 april – a week before polling day – was attacked by @entity82			2
the @entity71 peer told @entity106 's today programme it was right that the broadcasters should organise debates – but insisted it was up to political leaders if they wanted to take part			1
he said : ' the idea that broadcasters can threaten politicians with empty chairs , real or imaginary , is completely unacceptable and against the statutory requirement for impartiality			2
' it is not for the broadcasters to threaten the prime minister and risk breaching their duty of impartiality			2
' the @entity8 should stand up today and say that they are not going to empty - chair anybody or to threaten anybody			2
' these debates are fun to have , maybe nice to have			0
the benefits or the dis - benefits you can argue it either way			0
but there is no requirement that they should be done			0
and there is a requirement on the broadcasters for impartiality			0
' the conservatives believe mr @entity4 's election chances suffered by his decision to take part in tv election debates @entity82 , who left the @entity8 to become executive chairman of @entity9 , was scathing about the broadcasters ' handling of the debate negotiations			1
he said : ' i do n't think the broadcasters have covered themselves in glory in the way that they have campaigned for these debates , the way they have gone public early on , the way they have messed it up by missing out various parties			0
the thing is a shambles			0
it is embarrassing , frankly			0
' in an article in the @entity163 , @entity82 accused the broadcasters of trying to bully the prime minister by threatening to signal his absence from the debates with an empty chair			2
he wrote : ' it is bullying , a case of the broadcast media getting way ahead of itself			0
' @entity82 added : ' who do the broadcasters think they are ? their behaviour over the election debates leads me to believe they suddenly have grossly inflated and misguided ideas of their own importance			0

@entity183 said @entity4 was entitled not to show up to debates
he said the broadcasters could not ' empty chair ' the *pm* if he did not
but the ex cabinet minister said @entity1 could score political points over it
comes after former @entity8 chief @entity17 slams tv ' bullying ' tactics
