by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 would have been made at @entity3			1
his dad , @entity4 , was a @entity3 favourite in the mid nineties			1
he and @entity6 would have been @entity8 ’s sole flag - bearers in @entity9 and there was also the lure of a wage packet bursting with @entity13			2
but @entity14 decided against following in his father ’s stud marks and instead joined up with one of his old man ’s former @entity19 team - mates , @entity21 , in a decidedly less romantic location – @entity23			1
nevermind that : @entity2 insists he is ' over the moon ' at @entity23 despite the earlier interest from @entity3 earlier days : @entity2 played for @entity27 , before joining @entity28 on loan , and is now with @entity23 it 's not too late to play @entity31 ... there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest - scoring manager ! the 22 - year - old , however , is thrilled with his new surrounds , rejecting the @entity37 giants to swap the west coast of @entity27 for the east of @entity40			1
‘ i am over the moon , ’ said @entity2 , who signed a two - year deal at the @entity42 in july			1
‘ i have found my home			1
with the manager , when someone helps you out like that , not only on the pitch but off the pitch , you are happy			1
‘ when you are happy off the pitch the performances come on it			1
i know what i want to do , i ’ve got ambitions in myself			0
but first of all it is to try and do well for @entity23			0
’ and what of turning down the offer from @entity3 ? ‘ i ’ve said to many people , it ’s easy to just reach for the stars and go for the top and think “ yeah , i ’m doing this , i ’m doing that ”			1
but you have to think football , ’ said the @entity65 forward			0
‘ there are not many 20 , 21 , 22 - year - olds that are playing week in , week out in the @entity66 now			1
‘ i am with a great bunch of lads and there are a lot of games coming up , hopefully in the @entity74 and in the cup runs as well , there is plenty of football to be played			0
’ @entity23 will have to overcome a 1 - 0 deficit to @entity80 this week if they are to extend their stay in the @entity74			0
@entity2 was a second - half substitute on thursday as the @entity82 nicked victory following a gift from goalkeeper @entity85			2
and he reflected : ‘ it ’s a learning curve			0
this is our first ever time in this tournament			0
these @entity91 teams , you have to learn , you have to adjust to it			0
‘ throughout the game we looked the better side , we kept the ball			0
we had a 10 - minute spell where we were a little bit shaky but we soon got back under control and started creating chances			0
there are lots of positives to take into next week and we will be ready to take them on at the @entity104			0
’ @entity3 are one possible opponent should @entity23 progress to the group stage			2
the @entity108 , then , could yet await @entity2 this season			2
liking it : @entity2 says ‘ i am with a great bunch of lads and there are a lot of games coming up ' at @entity23			2

@entity2 does not *regret* following in dad @entity4 's *footsteps* at @entity3
the 22 - year - old says : ‘ i am over the moon . i have found my home '
@entity14 adds : ' with the manager , when someone helps you out like that , not only on the pitch but off the pitch , you are happy '
