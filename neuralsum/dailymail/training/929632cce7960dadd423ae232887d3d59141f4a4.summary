military chiefs have drawn up plans for a ' show of force ' to warn @entity3 against hostile action over the @entity5			1
there are fears of @entity9 - sanctioned aggression after march 's referendum if islanders as expected , vote in favour of retaining links with @entity15			1
in response , extra troops , another warship and an additional @entity20 fighter jet could be deployed or high - profile military exercises carried out in the @entity22 as a deterrent			2
show of force : additional military support could be sent to the @entity5 to support @entity27 ( pictured ) , which is currently patrolling the @entity28 , as tensions over the islands ' future rise ahead of the march referendum ours : a @entity15 flag is planted at a farm in the @entity5			1
residents will vote in a referendum on march 11 about whether they want to remain part of the @entity15 this could also involve the deployment of the @entity42 ’s @entity41 , a flotilla comprising destroyers , a frigate , a submarine and commandos			1
defence chiefs could also dispatch elements of the @entity51 ’s @entity50 — the airborne task force which includes members of the @entity53 — which has just completed a series of demanding exercises in @entity56 preparing for ' general war '			1
@entity58 will vote on march 11 on whether they wish to remain an overseas territory of the @entity15			1
it is expected there will be a 100 per cent ' yes ' vote , which intelligence officials have warned the prime minister could lead to an aggressive ' stunt ' by @entity3 , such as planting the country 's flag on the island			1
warning : @entity70 says he would be prepared to use military force again should tensions over the @entity5 escalate further other possibilities include the harassment by the @entity75 of the @entity5 ’ fishing fleet and the disruption of @entity15 oil and gas exploration			1
it is feared such a move would escalate tensions quickly if the @entity42 was ordered to intervene			2
a senior defence source told the paper : ' @entity15 needs to be in a situation to respond very quickly to a whole series of threats - that is why we have contingency plans			1
our posture has not changed but neither are we complacent			2
' there are a number of contingencies to deal with any threat to the @entity5 and they are currently being reviewed			2
no orders have been given to any military unit at this stage but prudent planning within all units who could be deployed in the event of a crisis is taking place			2
' that is quite normal			0
commanders like to be two steps ahead rather than two steps behind			0
' it is understood elements of force — such as a 150 - strong company group — can be flown to the @entity5 via @entity113 , in a matter of hours if needed			0
members of @entity116 recently returned from the islands as part of a routine deployment and would be perfectly placed to brief additional troops deploying at short notice			0
about 1,500 troops are permanently based on the islands , together with four @entity20 jets and anti-aircraft and artillery batteries			0
prince @entity126 recently served with the @entity20 ’s search and rescue helicopter unit based at @entity128			0
a @entity42 destroyer , currently @entity27 , is always on duty in the @entity22 , working alongside the patrol ship @entity132 , the fleet tanker @entity134 and the ice patrol ship @entity136			0
one of the @entity42 ’s nuclear powered submarines is always on notice to move to the region if the diplomatic situation deteriorates			0
last year @entity141 , a type 45 destroyer and one of the @entity42 ’s most capable vessels was dispatched to the @entity22 during the 30th commemoration of the war			0
despite hostile rhetoric from @entity3 president @entity148 , the @entity15 government believes that @entity9 currently lacks both the political will and military capability to recapture the islands			1
but the prime minister has told his cabinet and senior defence chiefs that @entity15 should not be complacent and must be fully prepared for every eventuality			1
soldiers prepare to advance on @entity128 during the @entity22 in 1982 : ( @entity157 ) pte @entity158 ( rip ) , lcpl @entity159 , pte @entity161 just last week the mr @entity70 insisted that @entity15 would not shirk from defending the islands if @entity3 attempted another invasion			1
referring to a recent briefing on the @entity5 at a @entity167 meeting , the prime minister said : ' i get regular reports on this entire issue because i want to know that our defences are strong , our resolve is extremely strong			0
' we have strong defences in place on the @entity5 , that is absolutely key , that we have fast jets stationed there , we have troops stationed on the @entity5			0
' a spokesman for the @entity181 , said : ' our overall military posture on the @entity5 remains unchanged and they remain well - defended			2
' the @entity181 has always had contingency plans in place to increase the military footprint in the @entity22 if required			0

' @entity15 needs to be able to respond quickly to series of threats '
islanders vote on march 11 if they wish to remain an overseas territory of @entity15
' yes ' vote is expected which could lead to aggressive stunt from @entity3
