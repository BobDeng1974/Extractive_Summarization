by @entity0 published : 17:38 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 9 september 2013 organic evangelist : lady @entity2 has spent over a year and £ 1million to open @entity3 down in the lush pastures of @entity6 , where every tomato is heritage and the beetroots are shaved , not pickled , trouble is a-brewing			1
@entity2 , @entity10 ’s pioneering champion of luxury eco-chic and all things organic , has uncovered a problem			1
married to the fabulously wealthy @entity15 magnate sir @entity14 , who has just been elevated to the @entity16 , @entity17 faces a teensy glitch in her bid to live a life untainted by chemicals , synthetics or the merest whiff of bad taste			1
brace yourselves , people : there is no such thing as organic condensed milk			1
that ’s a bit like saying there is no such thing as an organic deep - fried @entity35 bar , but one can sympathise with her plight			1
in her new @entity6 cook book , a @entity40 , subtitled @entity39 , we learn that @entity2 loves purple sprouting broccoli , coffee jelly ( ‘ it gives you a lift at the end of a meal ’ ) , clam linguine with butter and lots of salads of crunchy chopped vegetables , but only if the vegetables are chopped small			1
we also discover that choosing to live organically is not always a free - range picnic , not even for the most evangelical devotee			2
for when developing a recipe for chocolate , almond and espresso fudge in line with the @entity6 organic - only edicts , one of @entity66 ’s cooks was stumped when it came to making it without the condensed milk — surely that ’s against the fudge law ? so she fudged it with double cream			1
and another step forward for @entity66 ’s relentless , 36 - year organic crusade which encompasses farms , cheeses , a herd of rare breed @entity83 cows , her famous and much - copied farm shops , a bunch of cafes , a spa , bath products , a range of clothes made from natural fibres plus her recipe book — and now a pub. nestled in the @entity99 village of @entity100 , the pub welcomes locals with two topiary rabbits at the front door for @entity17 , 67 , has spent more than a year and £ 1 million overseeing the renovation of the former @entity106 pub in the idyllic @entity99 village of @entity100			1
now called @entity3 , the pub is just down the road from the @entity6 epicentre itself and boasts two giant topiary rabbits guarding the front door			1
inside , it is ravishing , with all the stripped back , rustic chic many have come to associate with the farm shop motherships			1
there is mellow , exposed brickwork , weathered oak and vases artfully drooping with cowslips and hedgerow berries			2
not one but three log fires crackle as customers sip blackberry bellinis or nurse beers served in the most elegant pint glasses i ’ve ever seen			2
at one table , a glamorous woman in a bubble skirt is enjoying a date night away from the kids			2
no wonder she looks familiar ; it is @entity133 and her husband @entity134			0
the previous evening , former labour cabinet minister @entity135 and her husband @entity136 also dined in the handsome restaurant , where @entity139 hams hang from the ceiling , bottles of @entity66 ’s own brand prosecco are on ice and even things as humdrum as chips are given the superstar treatment : hand - cut , cooked until gilded and crisp , served in miniature copper saucepans and costing £ 4 per portion			1
not one but three log fires crackle in front of the bar where @entity153 prosecco is being chilled ‘ that ’s about 70p per chip , ’ moaned one diner , but no one was listening			0
it is all achingly tasteful , from the pots of sage on the bleached wood tables in the garden to the raw linen napkins to the stone - flagged bathrooms , where loo paper is hung from artisan hazel twig holders and even the soap , blended from herbs and flowers , is organic , fragrant and desirable			1
does this make @entity3 , which opened four days ago , the poshest pub in @entity10 ? it certainly seems that way , even if some might think @entity66 has gone too far in her cream - paint quest for perfection			1
sometimes , just sometimes , it might be that little bit too precious			0
for example , on the @entity3 menu , ironic italics are used to describe a chilled blackberry and apple ‘ crumble ’			0
why the italics , i ask one of the passing waiters , all of whom are dressed in amusing checked shirts and jeans , like the cast of a local production of @entity193			0
‘ i do n’t know , ’ he said , with charm			0
‘ maybe it ’s because it is not really a			0
crumble ? ’ when i look at @entity17 ’s beetroot orzo with hazelnuts recipes , she reminds me a little of @entity200 , another clean queen whose 500 thread count bed linen , healthy , organic and multi-mansioned lifestyle means that she conveniently forgets ordinary people do not have the time , the staff or the resources to factor in the sour dough bread making , stock simmering , chutney making and quinoa soaking demands that such an existence entails			1
never mind , the @entity3 is sure to become a popular meeting place for the @entity217 set , whose @entity99 homes are dotted around the pub like a ring of not - too - distant compass points			1
@entity224 ’s @entity223 is out to the west , troubled former newspaper editor — and @entity17 ’s good friend — @entity228 and husband @entity229 live east , @entity230 and @entity231 are south at @entity232 while @entity233 , in whose constituency @entity234 stands , has a home farthest away , to the south east			1
even things as humdrum as chips are given the superstar treatment : hand - cut , cooked until gilded and crisp , served in miniature copper saucepans and costing £ 4 per portion			0
preciously , ironic italics are used to describe a chilled blackberry and apple ' crumble ' on the restaurant 's menu where waiters pass by in checked shirts and jeans the kind of stealthy , unobtrusive luxury available at the @entity3 is bound to appeal to them all , even if the pub launch is an intriguing development for @entity66			1
although her brands are much admired , not everything she has launched has been a commercial success			0
indeed , the latest figures from @entity263 show that @entity264 made a £ 4.3 million loss at the end of 2011			0
however , the @entity267 plough on regardless , and one gets the idea that money is not the motivating issue here			0
an early adopter , @entity2 has been passionate about organic farming since 1977			2
for most , buying organic is a choice made if you can afford it			2
for the @entity267 , it is a way of life , and one she wants to share			0
in 2002 , she started the @entity6 farm shop			1
from sheepskin ponchos to £ 300 truckles of artisan cheese , some of the things she does are so wildly extravagant , so far removed from the ordinary person ’s finances that even the yummy mummy bedrock of her businesses baulked			0
once an air hostess , @entity2 is now one of the richest women in the country — one ca n’t help but feel she has lost touch with family budgets			0
critics suggest it is easy for her to launch these money - draining ventures ; she is married to a billionaire			0
but it would be easier to do nothing			0
instead , she creates jobs — and fun			0
for i ca n’t help but feel she is on to something with her lovely pub , its first class food , made by her own former chef @entity304 , and 12 bedrooms			1
the 12 bedrooms are all named after woodland creatures , and offer a whirl of natural fabrics and throbbing neutrals costing about £ 100 a night — not extravagant in these parts — each room is named after a woodland creature — of course it is ! i stayed in @entity315 , a whirl of natural fabrics and throbbing neutrals			2
after a night swathed in so much monogrammed organic cotton and raw linen luxury , i know how it feels to be a coddled golden egg			2
in some respects , @entity66 is a @entity325 figure — let them eat organic — but i admire her field - to - folk ethic and her love of good food — even though few of us could afford to dine so well on a daily basis			2
once home , in my own not entirely organic environment , i channel the wholesome and totally @entity334 vibe			2
things i ’ve learned from her book ? if you ’ve got partridge legs — and i do , but not the way she thinks — freeze them for a pie			0
putting a pinch of salt in the water makes boiled eggs easier to peel — but does anyone apart from a multi-millionairess think peeling an egg is hard ? and please note that the @entity352 gang feel really quite happy describing their own chocolate brownies as ‘ iconic ’			0
things i learned from @entity234 pub ? that the potted rabbit and roast loin of rabbit they serve are actually farmed			1
so the place should really be called @entity361			0
or perhaps the @entity363 in @entity364 ? yes , most definitely that .			0

@entity0 visited @entity234 in the @entity99 village of @entity100
the posh pub is owned by @entity370 who started the @entity6 farm shop
' @entity17 's ' organic ethos is found in every nook and cranny of the pampered pub 's restaurant and bedrooms
