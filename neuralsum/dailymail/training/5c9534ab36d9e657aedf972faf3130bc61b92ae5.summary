by @entity1 reporter published : 18:55 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 25 july 2013 cockney speakers are now more likely to live in @entity3 than in the traditional heartlands of inner @entity6 's @entity5 , according to research			1
historically the dialect was used by people from the central - eastern boroughs of the capital , but a new multicultural way of speaking has emerged there in recent years			0
dr @entity15 , a socio - linguistic expert from @entity16 , found features of the traditional @entity19 dialect are now more likely to be heard in @entity20 or @entity21 than within the sound of @entity23 or modern - day @entity24 - where it originated			0
@entity27 : a popular feature on the streets of @entity6 's @entity5 among the older white working class population , which is making way for a wider multi-cultural community she said : ' in the last five decades @entity19 has probably undergone more rapid change than at any time in its long history			1
' without doubt the speech forms associated with @entity19 can still be heard but , with the multicultural diversity we now see in the @entity5 , the @entity19 label would seem to be becoming less and less relevant to the people living there			0
' according to dr @entity15 's research , since the 1950s a vast number of the white working class - families which predominated in the @entity5 in the early part of the 20th century have moved to other parts of the country such as @entity3			1
the once rural areas have now been urbanised and are now filled with @entity51 and their descendants			0
the @entity55 community , pictured here at @entity56 , now makes up over a third of the population in the borough of @entity24 in the @entity5 - they speak ' @entity60 ' she added : ' the sheer number of people who have moved from the traditional @entity5 into the surrounding areas of @entity6 , and in particular @entity3 , have ensured that the influence of @entity19 is still exerted in these areas and it is there that many features of the dialect can still be heard			1
' it is probably more accurate to say that @entity19 has now become more synonymous with white working - class speakers from a much larger geographical region of south east @entity73 and is not generally a term applied to speakers of minority ethnic backgrounds even if they have been born within the traditional @entity19 area			2
' the @entity55 community now makes up over a third of the population in the borough of @entity24 in the @entity5 and the vast majority of people in this area now speak what we have labelled as @entity60			2
' they do n't identify with being cockney and this new term is more reflective of the current population			0

a new multicultural way of speaking has emerged in the @entity5
many white working class - families from @entity6 's @entity5 have moved out
@entity55 community now makes up over a third of *locals* in the area
