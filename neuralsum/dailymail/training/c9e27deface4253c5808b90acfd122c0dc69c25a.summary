@entity2 and @entity3 are big fans of @entity5 and @entity6 but neither of the girls have any interest in politics , their parents have revealed			1
' they love @entity6 they love @entity5			1
@entity2 is still a @entity11 fan , although i think @entity3 has become a little less into boy bands , ' mrs @entity3 said in a joint interview for @entity15			1
' they 've gotten to know @entity5 , and she has always been very sweet to them , ' mr @entity16 added			1
how embarrassing : mrs @entity3 told how sometimes the girls shy away from introducing their dad to their friends because he can be too formal or ask too many questions though the girls were not present for the interview , which was excerpted online , they appeared to be the only ones picking pop culture favorites as the president remained diplomatic when asked who he would rather spend the day with : @entity30 or @entity31 and @entity32			1
the question was a loaded one - since mr @entity16 has previously criticized @entity34 and called @entity32 ' jacka * * ' after the rapper interrupted @entity38 's acceptance speech			0
the women : mr @entity16 said that he is surrounded by ' opinionated , strong , tall women ' ( seen together at a @entity42 event on sunday ) any old grievances were ignored , however , when president @entity3 was talking to people			1
' the @entity30 family seems like a pretty fun bunch , so i can see how that would be pretty fun			0
@entity32 's music is outstanding , though			0
i 've got a lot of his stuff on my @entity52			2
if it was a concert , then i might not mind listening to him , ' mr @entity16 said			0
he may have been trying to avoid a skirmish with @entity32 but incidentally ended up on a landmine as the timing of this article is a bad one for the @entity30 clan			0
patriarch @entity59 was quoted today as bashing gay men and lesbians in a recent interview and @entity63 has called for an apology			2
while the celebrity connections that come with the presidency undoubtedly prove popular with the first daughters friends , the same does n't always translate for the president himself			1
' @entity3 had friends over , and there was a question about whether she was going to even introduce them ( to her dad ) , because sometimes he gets a little formal , asking them about school and interests			1
she says " i do n’t know if my friends can handle that			0
" but she said that you actually did quite well , ' mrs @entity3 said			2
' i acquitted myself well			0
i did not embarrass her , ' mr @entity16 said			0
one thing that the entire family gets on board with is their light - hearted criticism of their father			0
' look , i 've got three opinionated , strong , tall women , and if they get together , they can have fun about my ears or being too loud or how i dress , ' he said			1
he does credit his daughters for being the ones to introduce him to social media tools , even though his administration and campaigns have touted their prowess for years			2
' technology is an area where they still help us old fogies out			0
you know , @entity101 , @entity102 , those are all things that i first heard from them , ' mr @entity16 said			0
up on the trends : @entity2 and @entity3 , seen here at their father 's second inaugural , were reportedly the ones to introduce the president to @entity101 and @entity102 the @entity3 were interviewed as part of the magazine 's @entity113 issue , and they did touch on heavier subjects like the @entity118 surveillance program and the beleaguered health care roll out but only briefly			1
he said how he was both ' frustrated ' about the @entity122 disclosures that prompted him to make an awkward call to @entity125 chancellor @entity124 after it was revealed that records of her phone calls were collected , and he found the sign up process for healthcare.gov ' frustrating '			1
one thing that he did seem upbeat about was the prospect of having more good news to report when he meets with @entity15 again next year - though even that promise will leave many upset			0
the @entity138 are currently in a public battle with the administration due to their restrictive access guidelines that prevent regular interviews with the president and forbids photographers from attending largely ceremonial events that they were previously invited to cover			2
' these so - called private events include meetings with world leaders and other visitors of major public interest — just the sorts of activities photojournalists should , and used to , have access to , ' @entity155 , the director of photography for the @entity156 wrote in an op - ed for the @entity158 .			2

@entity160 and @entity161 talked about their daughters love of @entity6 and @entity5 who he said has been ' very sweet ' to the girls
president said that he ends up being the butt of jokes when @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity161 are all together
' i 've got three opinionated , strong , tall women , ' he said
@entity3 said he found it ' frustrating ' when he tried to sign up for healthcare
interview with @entity179 comes as the @entity180 is facing major *backlash* from reporters over *unprecedented* access restrictions
