unflappable : sir @entity1 in ceremonial dress the puckish figure was ebullient			1
‘ come in , come in — forgive the awful state of the place , we ’ve had visitors , you know			2
’ it was just a few days after the end of the @entity11 , in june 1982 , and sir @entity1 , the islands ’ governor , was still very much in character			1
i was among his first visitors to @entity16 in @entity17 following his return to the islands			2
some ten weeks earlier , it had been taken over by the @entity22 army and the furniture was still largely in disarray			1
anti-blast tape still criss - crossed the windows of the low , white stone house , which was built for governors in 1845			0
but — crucially — the @entity30 ’s portrait ( removed to a safe - house as the attack was beginning ) was back on the wall , and sir @entity1 ushered in his visitors with relish			1
it was not hard to see how this tiny figure , barely 5ft 4in tall , had brazenly stood up to the heavily - armed invaders			0
true , he had added almost two feet to his height by first putting on his ceremonial plumed hat to face them			0
among the list of famous quotations drawn from wars down the years , the words of sir @entity1 , who has just died at the age of 86 , will surely always raise a smile of pride among students of that brief war			1
sir @entity1 ignored the outstretched hand of the new — and very temporary — @entity22 governor , @entity53 , who admonished him , saying : ‘ it is very ungentlemanly of you to refuse to shake my hand			1
’ sir @entity1 replied in his sharp , staccato voice : ‘ it is very uncivilised of you to invade my country			1
’ for the truth is that war was the very last thing @entity1 and his wife @entity64 had expected when , in 1980 , he became governor of the @entity66 in what he knew was probably his last posting in the @entity70 and @entity69			1
born in @entity71 , @entity72 , in june 1926 , he had been a @entity73 pilot in the @entity74 for several years before joining the @entity75 in 1951			0
he served in half - a - dozen places , including @entity77 , where they were frequently without electricity and running water , let alone drainage , and @entity82 , where he was the last @entity83 official to leave the @entity83 embassy in @entity85 , handing the dangling set of keys to @entity89 reporter @entity88 as the @entity91 army from the @entity92 stormed in			0
hero : sir @entity1 , who was considered a hero in the @entity95 , has died aged 86 governor @entity1 and officials from the @entity98 were forcibly evicted from the @entity95 by the @entity22 forces and sent to the @entity101 capital @entity102 sir @entity1 returned as governor following the 74 - day war and remained in his post until 1985 after this , sir @entity1 thought , anywhere else would feel like a holiday			1
when the @entity95 were offered , the @entity98 said it would be ‘ a tranquil but absorbing posting ’			0
not so ! two years later , @entity64 and their two children , together with domestic staff from @entity16 , were sheltering in friends ’ homes in @entity17 while battle raged , and her portly husband was facing the invaders — incredibly — with a pistol			0
everything that had led to this moment was astonishing , both militarily and diplomatically			0
first , the cynical @entity98 had sent him there expecting this comfortable , mature family man to convince the islanders that their best interests would be served if they drifted away from @entity83 ( 7,000 miles away ) and accepted @entity22 sovereignty just across the water			1
successive @entity83 governments , anxious to divest themselves of what they knew was potential trouble , had been considering relinquishing the @entity132 since the mid-sixties			0
@entity22 , of course , had been claiming sovereignty for 150 years			1
the @entity98 saw @entity1 as the ideal man , as he put it , ‘ to gain the islanders ’ confidence and talk them into accepting a lease - back solution with @entity22 ’			1
what happened , instead , was that sir @entity1 found himself sympathising with their wish to remain @entity83			1
as he wrote in his memoir , my @entity149 : ‘ i had previously determined that if it should ever reach the stage that the @entity98 instructed me to pursue a policy that i believed to be against the best interests of the @entity95 , i should have no alternative but to resign			0
’ defiant : sir @entity1 pictured with the @entity151 ( left ) who fought during the @entity95 conflict as a naval helicopter pilot in 1982 and with then prime minister @entity155 and her husband sir @entity156 after the war in which @entity83 reclaimed them from @entity22 ( right ) sir @entity1 held discussions with the 1,800 islanders who made their feelings very clear : they were @entity83 and wanted to stay @entity83			1
for his part , @entity1 saw it as his moral duty to represent their views to @entity167 , not @entity167 ’s views to them			1
as long as they wanted to stay @entity83 , their rights were the same as any other @entity83 people			0
back at the @entity98 , there was near apoplexy			0
@entity1 had ‘ gone native ’			1
it was n’t long before the then @entity178 defence secretary , @entity177 , was announcing the withdrawal of the @entity83 @entity181 survey ship , the @entity182			0
it was ostensibly part of defence cuts , but the islanders saw it as a first indication of @entity83 withdrawal			0
whether or not it really was an invitation to the @entity22 navy , as they suspected , on march 19 , 1982 , a party of @entity22 ‘ scrap metal merchants ’ landed on @entity194 , a tiny @entity83 island 800 miles east of the @entity95 , and hoisted an @entity22 flag			1
@entity1 was not only governor , he was also commander - in - chief of the @entity95 , so he ordered a unit of @entity199 to remove them			1
to his astonishment , this was countermanded in @entity167 by foreign secretary @entity203			0
on march 31 , the @entity98 learned that an @entity22 fleet had set sail for the @entity95 with orders to seize them			2
the @entity207 was immediately informed , and @entity83 ’s ambassador to the @entity209 was told — but it was 24 hours before the @entity98 passed this information to our man in @entity17			0
sir @entity1 and @entity199 ( left ) and major @entity213 , @entity199 ( 2nd left ) speaking to @entity155 , then prime minister , at @entity216 when it did finally arrive , this terrible news of an impending invasion was couched in words that read as though they had been dictated behind a yawn : ‘ we have apparently reliable evidence that an @entity22 task force will gather off @entity227 early tomorrow morning , april 2			1
you will wish to make your dispositions accordingly			0
’ dispositions with what ? @entity1 had just 68 @entity199			2
desperately , he asked @entity167 for instructions			0
@entity167 ’s hand - washing reply left him feeling very alone : ‘ when you tell the islanders is up to your own judgment			2
when you arrest the @entity22 is also up to you			2
‘ but we would advise you that although it seems very likely that an invasion will take place , there are still negotiations going on , and even at this late moment , an invasion might be avoided			2
‘ your action in rounding up the @entity22 might precipitate the very action we wish to avoid			2
’ but that is precisely what the plucky sir @entity1 did , or at least indicated , with an order to his military force to ‘ arrest ’ the @entity22			1
it was a case of @entity250			0
@entity251 began two hours later with heavy fire on @entity16			0
having only a small defensive force , he had to consider surrender , if only to prevent loss of life , but he quickly rejected the idea			2
bit by bit , the @entity22 forces pushed to within 20 yards of the house			2
but sir @entity1 refused to leave his study , sitting at his desk brandishing his @entity264 - made pistol , resolving to shoot any @entity22 who dared burst through his door			1
eventually , with his free hand , he picked up the phone to an @entity22 air force senior officer , persuading him to come to @entity16 for talks under the protection of a white flag the officer came ( cowering on the ground as his own confused troops mistakenly shot at him ) and eventually , with a white sheet draped over @entity1 ’s own umbrella , the officer and the @entity95 ’ chief secretary walked together to the town hall to arrange a truce , enabling the wounded to be taken to hospital			1
sir @entity1 pictured left with his wife @entity64 pictured in 1984 during their time in the @entity95 , and in @entity285 , @entity286 where he retired to , right at this point , sir @entity1 put down his pistol and ordered the @entity199 to lay down their weapons			1
to the @entity22 , however , this appeared as a signal of defeat			2
within hours , the @entity22 soldiers were strutting into @entity17 and lounging all over @entity16 — including the governor ’s study			2
with @entity1 expelled from the island and flown to @entity101 , the @entity22 thought they had reclaimed the @entity95			1
fortunately for the islanders , though , back in @entity167 , prime minister @entity155 had very different ideas from her own @entity98 — and before long was ordering the assembly of a @entity300			0
some ten weeks later , sir @entity1 was returning to the @entity95 in triumph			1
when , three years later , he retired from the governorship just before his 60th birthday , many islanders wept			0
he was more than their governor , he was their saviour			0
in recent years , he and his wife lived in @entity285 where he played a little golf , had intermittent gout , gave talks about his time in the @entity95 and was chairman of the @entity313			0
he never tired of talking about the @entity95 or its people			0
‘ they ’re great @entity83 people , ’ he declared that cold morning in 1982 soon after the war ’s end , as he showed us into @entity16 and opened a bottle of wine			2
‘ who would want to be anything else ? ’			0

sir @entity1 became a household name when he was taken *prisoner* by the @entity22 invasion force and expelled to @entity101 in 1982
he famously refused to shake the hand of the @entity22 general commanding the invasion , *admiral* @entity332
sir @entity1 will be *remembered* for his ' courage and *dignity* ' during the conflict
