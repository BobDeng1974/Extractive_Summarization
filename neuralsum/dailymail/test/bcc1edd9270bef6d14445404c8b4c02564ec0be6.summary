@entity5 is knocked out in a collision with @entity21 ’s @entity23 in the @entity11 last month @entity5 was out cold for approximately eight minutes and has n't played since the @entity21 game on march 21st ‘ it ’s a concern because i do n’t like someone coming in with something you ca n’t diagnose , ’ said @entity0 , @entity6 ’ director of rugby			1
‘ sometimes a physio will sit you down and say , “ it ’s six to 12 weeks out ”			2
here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever — we do n’t have a timescale			0
