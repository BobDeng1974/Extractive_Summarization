@entity0 hailed the ' perfect game ' after his @entity3 side underlined their @entity5 title credentials by sweeping aside @entity6 5 - 0 at the @entity7			1
@entity8 and @entity9 both scored twice in the first half to put @entity3 in cruise control before substitute @entity12 grabbed a fifth goal 11 minutes from time to ensure @entity6 suffered their heaviest home defeat for 24 years			1
' it was a perfect game , everything went in our direction , ' @entity3 manager @entity0 said			1
@entity3 's midfielder @entity8 scored twice as @entity3 won 5 - 0 away at @entity6 on saturday ' to score a goal in the first minute makes an immediate difference			1
to be 4 - 0 up at half - time is not game over , especially in the @entity5 , but it 's a good situation to control and we did that in the second half			1
' i was on the bench saying they were similar goals in terms of principles as the one we scored against @entity34 in the first game of the season			0
' the team is playing with high quality and has a clear identity of playing			2
sometimes teams are good and play well without the clear identity , but all this season we are going in a certain direction and have a certain kind of way to play football			2
' @entity3 's win opened up a five - point lead on their nearest challengers @entity50 , who entertain @entity52 at the @entity53 on sunday , but @entity0 felt the victory would not increase the pressure on @entity57 's chasers			1
@entity59 striker @entity9 ( second left ) also added a double as @entity3 cruised to victory ' i do n't think they feel it ( pressure ) , ' @entity0 said			1
' they have to win but they know that			0
' we do n't feel pressure , we feel responsibility , and for them it 's not a problem			0
' a team like them with the experience they have - much more than us - it 's not a problem			2
' i keep saying the same to my players and they have to understand it , there is no history without titles so if we play fantastically well and we do n't win cups in 20 years time no one will remember this team			0
' i am the first one that wants the team to play well but we have to win competitions			0
' this team is a young team with lots of years in front of them , but we are trying this season to make some history by winning something			0
' @entity3 boss @entity0 was delighted with his side 's dominant display against the @entity98 @entity0 said he felt for his opposite number @entity100 , who was without three midfielders in @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 and who was forced to play @entity107 in an unfamiliar deeper role			1
@entity6 also appeared to carry a hangover following the Â£ 25million midweek sale of top scorer @entity111 and @entity100 later apologised for a performance which never recovered from @entity107 losing possession inside the first minute for @entity8 to open the scoring			1
' i said sorry to @entity0 that i could n't give him a game today , ' @entity100 said			0
' it was a horrible performance and the first 45 minutes was our worst of the season			0
' it 's difficult to make those mistakes continuously and against a @entity3 side like that it magnifies it even more			2
' we did n't give fans the performance we wanted and i can only apologise because it 's my team and i take full responsibility for that			0
' @entity6 boss @entity100 has apologised to the fans for his team 's display against @entity3 but @entity100 insisted that @entity6 's heaviest home defeat since a 6 - 1 thrashing to @entity135 in april 1991 would not derail a league campaign which has seen them placed in the top 10 all season			1
' the good thing is we 're still in a good position and i do n't worry about the long - term because i know the characters in that dressing room , ' @entity100 said			2
' it 's one performance we have to reflect on and learn from but every time we 've had a disappointment we 've reacted straight away and this defeat wo n't define our season			0
