my teenagers demand something a bit more exciting than sand and sea from family summer holidays nowadays , and given their obsession with all things @entity10 , we decided on @entity11 this year			1
in fact , we plumped for a classic @entity14 road trip - driving along the @entity15 ( aka @entity16 ) from @entity17 to @entity18			1
it took @entity20 , @entity21 and i three weeks to do it , and we fitted so much in during that time it 's difficult to even do it justice			1
navigating @entity16 from @entity17 's iconic @entity27 to @entity18 , @entity26 enjoys her road trip @entity17 is known as @entity14 's most @entity30 city , possibly because you 'll need to pack a fleece even in late july			1
the mist that rolls in off the sea and shrouds the @entity27 most days can sometimes linger , but we never stayed still long enough to get cold			1
based in the funky @entity35 - where the foyer - come games room and bar is plastered with colossal photos of @entity39 and past guests of @entity41 - we spent three days hurtling around the city , often clinging for dear life to the famous cable cars that haul you up and down the @entity47 's hills			1
we ate clam chowder from a bread bowl at @entity50 , we trawled the boutiques of @entity52 in search of the summer of love , we bussed out to the @entity55 , and we wondered at the aquarium in @entity57			1
@entity26 travelled the scenic route , taking in beaches and , fleeces on , we took the boat trip to @entity41 , which is not to be missed			1
the brilliant audio guide that leads you around the prison is narrated only by men who were once guards or prisoners on the rock , making for an eerie and compelling tour			1
after trying to distil the city into only 72 hours , we climbed into our suv and headed for @entity16			1
it 's only about 350 miles as the crow flies between @entity17 and @entity18 , but this ( mostly ) coastal route is probably well over 500 miles long as it winds through some of @entity11 's most wonderful , ever - changing scenery			1
much of the highway has a 55mph speed limit and has only one lane in each direction - it 's time to take your foot off the gas , relax and take it all in			1
my children said it reminded them of @entity86 as we headed south past @entity87 and then nipped briefly into @entity88 to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of @entity91 , the waterfront district made famous in @entity93 's novel of the same name			1
at @entity21 's insistence , we took a detour on to 17 mile drive , the scenic road around the @entity99 that leads to the world - famous @entity101 golf club			1
he was rather disappointed by the condition of the course there , but thrilled with the state of @entity107 and @entity108 , our first port of call just outside the pretty little town of @entity112			1
even the non-golfers among us loved our luxurious bungalow at the edge of the course ; secluded and tranquil , plush and green with a view of distant mountains			1
when the sound of silence got too much for us , just across the street at @entity123 there was the excellent and lively @entity126 @entity125 restaurant , and a wonderful deli too			1
leaving @entity112 , you find yourself at the edge of the spectacular area known as @entity131 : wild and often mountainous terrain battling it out with the equally wild @entity15			1
dining in @entity91 , the waterfront district made famous in @entity93 's novel of the same name the road coils up and down cliffs and crosses cavernous gorges for almost 100 miles - incredibly dramatic but sometimes not for the faint - hearted			2
we stopped off at the @entity139 , in a baking - hot and silent valley , where the crash of the waves was replaced by the hum of insects and the call of the buzzards wheeling overhead			2
this was a completely different wildness , underlined when @entity21 narrowly avoided stepping on a basking rattlesnake			1
at the end of @entity131 you can encounter yet another type of wildness altogether in the form of the legendary @entity155 in @entity156			2
every bedroom is themed here - from @entity159 ( it 's a cave ) to @entity160 and the comparatively muted silver walls and flock wallpaper of our own @entity163			2
to call the @entity155 ' kitsch ' is to do it a huge disservice , because it takes everything to a whole new level of eye - popping taste			2
take the @entity172 , which puts the shocking into pink			2
the whole place is furnished and upholstered in this garish shade , softened only by the presence of enormous gold chandeliers			2
you have to see it to believe it , but the food and service were fantastic			2
@entity131 : where the wild and often mountainous terrain battles it out with the equally wild @entity185 we took a rare detour off @entity16 to the @entity189 settlement of @entity190 , a sort of cutesy yet sinister re-creation of @entity193 in the @entity11 sun , full of pastry shops and @entity197 tourists			1
a little unnerved by this , we headed back to the safety of the highway and soon found ourselves in @entity201			2
it 's the classic @entity11 of posters and t - shirts , with infinitely long palm - lined streets with mountains at one end and the ocean at the other			2
we stayed at the beach side end of one such thoroughfare in the aptly named @entity212 , and found great seafood at the end of the pier at @entity216 opposite the hotel and at the fantastic @entity218 just a couple of blocks along @entity221			2
over the rail tracks behind the inn is @entity224 , where you can find everything from @entity227 's and @entity228 to tattooists and cavernous bars advertising @entity231			0
the farmers ' market closes the street on a tuesday afternoon , offering up a @entity236 cornucopia of fruit , veg and other tasty treats			0
to the east of @entity224 is the @entity241 , an old industrial area that is regenerating itself into a haven of restaurants , art galleries and wine - tasting rooms			0
back on the road near @entity247 , you will see exotic animals on either side of the highway			0
floundering on the beach are gigantic elephant seals - enormous specimens of blubbery ugliness hooting and honking and generally having a riot at the edge of the sea			0
spectacular : an enormous @entity260 marble swimming pool dominates @entity262 's magnificent mansion on the other side are zebras - direct descendants of the herd that press tycoon @entity262 installed at the magnificent @entity267 , which appears right ahead of you			0
you can take a tour of the castle and its grounds			0
after a 15 - minute coach drive up the snaking road to the top of the hill , you discover a spectacular mansion furnished with antiques and tapestries from all over @entity30 , and boasting roman baths , an enormous @entity260 marble swimming pool and its own private cinema			0
in the 1930s , @entity267 was party central for @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity288 et al			0
having soaked up a bit of the @entity291 of @entity292 , we headed off on @entity16 again to see the @entity47 of today			1
there we stayed at the slick and sleek @entity295 @entity294 , choosing the beach - life of @entity294 and @entity297 over the urban sprawl of @entity292 or @entity299 where the car is king			0
the body - builders and gymnasts of @entity304 and the rollerblading buskers of @entity297 are highly entertaining , and you can walk everywhere			0
@entity292 is really an idea rather than a place anyway			0
it always seems as if it might be just around the next corner but it never is , and the @entity292 sign always stays aloof in the distance			0
what a beach : @entity314 is a pure three - and - a - half miles of uncrowded white sand loved by surfers we went on an excellent guided tour taking in the @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 and other spots of note			0
a sunday trip to @entity326 was great fun , too , for the rides and a look at a real working film set on its day off			0
mind you , the scariest ride of the day was getting on the freeway by accident on the way into @entity18			0
unless you 're a professional stunt driver in a hurry , the freeway is probably best avoided in favour of a trundle along the city 's more sedate boulevards			0
we drove the last 40 miles south through the @entity18 suburbs to our final stop at the @entity344			0
and what a beach it is - three - and - a - half miles of uncrowded white sand known as @entity314			0
it was thrilling to watch the guys surfing along on the waves			0
later we watched the sun go down over the pier from the comfort of the superb @entity354 , before ambling back along a beach glowing with fire - pits and shrouded in barbecue smoke - preparing ourselves for the horrors of donning fleeces again for the journey home			0
@entity361 ( americansky.co.uk , 0843 6362001 ) offers an 11 - night self - drive @entity11 tour from Â£ 1,199pp			0
it includes room - only accommodation at a choice of hotels along the route from @entity17 to @entity18 , return flights with @entity371 from @entity372 into @entity17 and out of @entity18 , and 4wd car hire			1
