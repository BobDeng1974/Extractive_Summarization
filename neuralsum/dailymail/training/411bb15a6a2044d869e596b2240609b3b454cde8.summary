by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 20:30 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 19 june 2013 the journalist who won fame as the man who caused the downfall of general @entity7 died tuesday in an horrific early morning car crash			1
@entity9 was known as a no - nonsense reporter			1
his candid @entity12 interview with the @entity14 general in 2010 was only one of many of the 33 - year - old ’s accomplishments			1
@entity9 most recently worked for @entity19 , where editor - in - chief @entity20 called the late reporter ‘ a great , fearless journalist with an incredible instinct for the story , and a gift for finding ways to make his readers care about anything he covered from wars to politicians			1
’ he is survived by his wife @entity34			2
@entity52 ' intimate access to top @entity14 commander @entity7 and his day to day comings and goings gave the reporter a look into the mind of a top level war general			1
where most reporters would have taken the generals ' irreverent mockery -- of president @entity63 , @entity64 , and other non-military commanders -- with a grain of salt , @entity9 saw it as the stuff of great news reporting			1
friends and colleagues mourn @entity9 on @entity71 ... though convention dictated that he repay the general and his associates for his access with a glossed - over , reverential piece , @entity52 produced a raw account of what the actual @entity7 looked like as he stood at the helm of the war in @entity14			1
and he did n't look good			2
the decorated soldier came off as crude and remarks about higher - ups like , ' vice president @entity64 ... who 's that ? ' spelled his doom			2
mere hours after @entity9 ' article appeared in @entity12 , @entity7 was summoned from the war to @entity90 , where he offered his resignation			1
big fall : @entity52 published gen. @entity7 's behind the scenes comments about civilian commanders and the general later stepped down no stranger to tragedy : @entity9 chronicled his time in @entity99 , where his then fiance @entity100 ( left ) was killed in an attack , in a bestselling memoir ( right ) the @entity104 native was also the author of two books about @entity107 ’s most recent wars			1
@entity9 was well placed as journalist within the tight circle around @entity14 top commander @entity7 , but the ' hard - charging ' journalist was not interested in painting a rosy picture of the war chief 's unseemly conduct in this @entity12 piece @entity49 in 2010			1
@entity52 ' intimate access to @entity7 and his close allies was unusual and showed him an often immature side of the man in charge of all @entity122 and @entity107 forces in @entity14 , beginning with a loose - lipped night of drinking in @entity124			1
' in private , ' writes @entity52 in @entity49 , ' @entity125 likes to talk sh * * about many of @entity63 's top people on the diplomatic side			1
' loose lips like that would have gone un-noted by some journalists , a sort of traditional thank you for access granted , but not by @entity52			2
the general seemed to have a particular dislike for vice president @entity64			1
' are you asking about vice president @entity64 , ' @entity7 jokes at one point			2
" who 's that ? " ' many comments like that made it into the final , published article and within hours of its publishing , @entity7 had been summoned to @entity90 , all the way from the war theater , where he would offer his resignation			2
in the @entity153 , @entity9 writes a more detailed , long form account of what the war in @entity14 looked like from the point of view of the commanders on the ground			1
his other book , i lost my love in @entity99 , is also a chronicle of war , but with added personal tragedy			2
@entity9 went to @entity167 to cover the war at the age of 25			1
soon after , his girlfriend @entity100 followed			2
the two met in @entity171 in 2005			2
when he left to cover the war , she took a job with the @entity174 , a group dedicated to spreading democratic practices around the world			1
while on a mission for her employer , @entity100 was killed in a @entity99 carbombing			2
the two were set to marry			2
a long , dark period for @entity52 followed and i lost my love in @entity99 became the bestselling result of his grieving process			2
he would later find love with writer @entity34 , a writer and former speechwriter for @entity190 and @entity191 communications strategist who frequently appears as a commentator on political news programs			0
the @entity99 incident , however , would not be the first senseless tragedy to befall @entity52			0
early tuesday morning , around 4:15am , a car plowed into a tree in @entity198 , @entity42 and burst into flames			1
the body was too badly burned to be immediately identified , reports @entity201			0
but by tuesday evening , both @entity19 and @entity12 had identified @entity9 as the victim of the horrific crash			1
he was pronounced dead at the scene			0
the cause of the accident remains unclear			0
now , @entity52 ’ wife , @entity207 , must carry the same weight her husband once did after @entity100 ’s death in @entity167			0
wife : @entity9 found love despite his tragic past in writer / commentator @entity34			1
now she must bear the same burden of tragedy her late husband once did tragic life : @entity9 also wrote a book detailing his time as a 25 - year - old war reporter and the fiance he lost in a @entity99 ambush @entity9 is also survived by his beloved corgi @entity224			1
@entity12 wrote an obituary for the brash , hard - hitting star reporter with appropriate honesty : ‘ hard - charging , unabashedly opinionated , @entity9 was original and at times abrasive			1
he had little patience for flacks and spinmeisters and will be remembered for his enthusiastic breaches of the conventions of access journalism			0
’ bittersweet legacy : @entity9 is survived by his wife @entity207 and his beloved corgi @entity224 last year , @entity9 contributed to @entity237 's politics section with a list of suggestions , advice really , for up - and - coming and wannabe young journalists that showcased his trademark single - minded dedication			1
' i am @entity9 , ' it begins , ' a reporter for @entity19 and a writer for @entity12 ' okay , here 's my advice to you ( and young journalists in general ) : 1			1
you basically have to be willing to devote your life to journalism if you want to break in			0
treat it like it 's medical school or law school			0
when interviewing for a job , tell the editor how you love to report			1
how your passion is gathering information			0
do not mention how you want to be a writer , use the word " prose , " or that deep down you have a sinking suspicion you are the next @entity265			0
be prepared to do a lot of things for free			0
this sucks , and it 's unfair , and it gives rich kids an edge			0
but it 's also the reality			0
when writing for a mass audience , put a fact in every sentence			0
also , keep the stories simple and to the point , at least at first			0
you should have a blog and be following journalists you like on @entity71			0
if there 's a publication you want to work for or write for , cold call the editors and / or email them			0
by the second sentence of a pitch , the entirety of the story should be explained			0
( in other words , if you ca n't come up with a rough headline for your story idea , it 's going to be a challenge to get it published			0
mainly you really have to love writing and reporting			0
like it 's more important to you than anything else in your life -- family , friends , social life , whatever			0
learn to embrace rejection as part of the gig			0
keep writing / pitching / reading .			0
