by @entity0 published : 15:27 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 06:32 est , 9 april 2013 you can spot a @entity3 lady from what seems like a mile away			1
she is wearing that rainbow of color , a cheeky print and , most likely , a smile on her face			1
what @entity11 did for fashion is more a story about what she did for women : she made them happy			1
she gave them a mini vacation			1
style signature : @entity11 , pictured in her @entity3 shift in 1965 , died yesterday at the age of 81			1
she became known for cheeky prints and easy cuts that women across @entity27 loved ' her clothes were transporting , ' said @entity29 , creative director of @entity30 , @entity31			1
' you automatically think of @entity33 , or sunny @entity34 in a @entity36 photograph			1
' @entity11 died sunday at her home in @entity33 , @entity38 she was 81			1
she had launched her business in the 1950s - by accident			1
she was socialite with time to spare and a wealthy husband who owned citrus groves , so she started a juice stand on a busy shopping street			2
fashion darling : @entity46 pictured in 2002 after her spring 2003 catwalk show in @entity48 she needed dresses in tropical prints ( no dowdy aprons for @entity3 ! ) that would hide stains			2
the loose , sleeveless cotton shape that came to be known as the shift was perfect for the task and local climate			2
@entity57 by @entity3 : @entity46 's designs became popular for baby showers , weddings , and garden and pool parties ' i designed collections around whatever struck my fancy			2
fruits , vegetables , politics or peacocks ! i entered in with no business sense			2
it was a total change of life for me , but it made people happy , ' @entity11 told @entity0 in 2009			1
her clothes , and later accessories and home goods , were n't dictated by runway trends or sweeping sociological statements : they were about lifestyle , and a lifestyle that real people had or , at least , wanted			1
few people wear their @entity11 pieces on a dreary day , or to a routine dental appointment or a boring business meeting			1
you see them at baby showers , weddings , and garden and pool parties			2
you 'll see them on little girls , their mothers and grandmothers , because no one corners the market when it comes to being cheerful			2
@entity46 and the company she sold her name to court women of different ages , body types and hometowns , @entity29 noted , but what links them all together is a ' life 's a party ' attitude			0
there 's a broader audience than one might think for pineapple - printed swimsuits and monkey - covered caftans			0
they 're almost a given for a southern belle or a @entity120 prepster , but even cosmopolitan city sophisticates ca n't wait to pull out their sunniest styles and head out to the @entity123			0
the brand was purposefully inclusive , said @entity125 , now the vice president of creative communications of @entity11 's former company			1
the bright stuff : @entity46 's scarf designs in an array of her famous tropical prints ' if someone is wearing the same print , you high five them ! i do n't want to use the word " club , " though , because that seems exclusive			0
anyone who is happy and wants to have a good time can come to our party			0
' @entity144 disposition : @entity46 pictured in 2004 during an interview in her company 's @entity148 offices @entity125 said @entity11 occupies a unique spot in the fashion world			1
' it 's so not fashion - y , but it is fashion because it has such a strong point of view			0
' ' the look is colorful , it tends to be preppy - it 's an iconic @entity27 look based on a lifestyle that 's based around these prints , ' @entity29 said			0
@entity46 also paved the way for today 's popular lifestyle brands , including @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 , and even @entity165 , @entity29 added			0
it was a different business than the avant - garde catwalk designers showing in @entity168 during the ' 60s			0
it was about loyalty and longevity instead of drastic swings of the pendulum			0
then - first lady and fashion plate @entity173 , a former schoolmate of @entity46 , wore one of the shifts in a @entity178 photo spread , confirming the look 's legitimacy			0
@entity11 retired from the day - to - day business in 1993 after a rough patch in the @entity184 era of power dressing			1
but the company and its hallmark prints have returned to profitability			0
chain reaction : @entity46 had stores like this @entity192 outpost across @entity27 sales of the brand were strong in the earnings period that ended feb. 2 , according to parent company @entity197 ' report			0
revenue increased 26per cent to $ 29.1 million			0
@entity46 's attitude is still pervasive at the company and in new products , said @entity125			0
' if we 've put a twinkle in your eye , then we have honored her			0

@entity11 died yesterday at her home in @entity33 , @entity38 . she was 81
