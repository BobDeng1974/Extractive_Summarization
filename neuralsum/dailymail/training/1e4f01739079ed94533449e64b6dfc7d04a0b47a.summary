an exact re-enactment of the first shot fired at the beginning of @entity3 at 12.45pm on august 5 , 1914 occurred precisely 100 years later today at @entity4 in southern @entity5			1
hundreds of relatives of those who fought attended the special centenary ceremony held at the @entity4 barracks which lays claim to firing the first shot of all the @entity13 allied forces during @entity3 it was the first incident involving @entity16 troops with the first shot taking place just three hours and 45 minutes after the war was declared in @entity16 an entire century ago			1
‘ 417,000 enlisted , 332,000 served overseas , 152,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came home , ’ he said			2
‘ of the 270,000 to return more than half had been wounded and others had mental scars which never healed			2
’ ‘ we acknowledge those who have done what we have not			0
’ although @entity45 declared war on @entity47 at 11 pm in @entity48 on august 4 , 1914 , it was not announced in @entity16 until 12.30pm on 5 august by then prime minister @entity49 due to the time difference			1
at the moment the war was declared , the @entity47 freighter @entity52 ( outbound from @entity54 ) sailed to point @entity4 to have her papers checked			1
being found in order , she was given clearance to resume her voyage to sea under the guidance of an @entity16 pilot			1
at 12.45 pm , however , the declaration of war was flashed to point @entity4 and before the ship could reach the entrance , a shot was fired across her bows as an order to return to port			1
the @entity52 then anchored off @entity72 , the master and crew were interned , and the ship was renamed @entity76 and became a troop carrier			0
hundreds attended the ceremony on tuesday to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in @entity3 the battle was the first war to have been fought by land , sea and air the @entity52 anchored off @entity72 and the master and crew were interned , while the ship was renamed @entity76 and became a troop carrier hundreds attended the ceremony to pay their respects to the 61,000 soldiers who never came home one of those who returned was @entity96 who was only 24 when he joined the @entity97 and embarked for northern @entity98 in 1914			1
after training in @entity99 , he was deployed to @entity100 where he quickly learnt the difficulty of war			2
he told his children how some of his friends had died in his arms ; how not all the @entity108 soldiers had rifles and some men had to take them from dead soldiers in order to defend themselves ; how the @entity16 soldiers did not have enough to eat , but that the @entity13 soldiers would sometimes share their rations with them and how it was a particular treat when the @entity13 would share their dark chocolate			1
though he survived the war and returned to @entity16 where he had eight children and lived until he was 78 , he would talk on occasion about the horrendous terrain , the poor planning and how he waded through water infested with maggots because of the decomposing bodies left in the trenches			1
in what was perhaps his last photograph before that ordeal , @entity96 posed with the other 702 members of the @entity132 on the @entity133 in what is now one of the most iconic photographs of @entity16 's involvement in the @entity3			1
on the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of @entity3 , @entity138 is one of the few men who have been identified from the photograph and whose story is known			1
in one of the most iconic photographs of the @entity3 , the 11th @entity144 posed on the @entity133 of @entity147 to have their photograph taken the section of the photograph that @entity96 ( third from right ) features in is the source of many myths , including that the linked men were all related and died the day after the photograph was taken the @entity158 has divided the photograph up in a grid and assigned each soldier a number , the year numbers are people who are partially verified , the green number represent those whose identities are fully verified his daughter @entity165 , 72 , has been involved in the project of finding the identities and stories of the other soldiers			1
mrs @entity165 , a retired school registrar from @entity170 , says she has known about the photograph for a long time and bought a print 15 years ago			2
' there 's no photo of war like that , really			2
there are so many stories to tell about each of the men , it 's quite amazing ... it is a very interesting piece of history in the one photo			0
naturally i 'm quite proud , my dad is in it , ' she told @entity190			0
the photograph is mentioned in the diary of captain @entity193 from the @entity132 , who wrote on sunday january 10 , 1915 : ' after @entity196 this morning the whole battalion was marched up to the @entity197 ) and we had a photo took or at least several of them			0
' there is incredible detail in the photograph , for instance , mrs @entity165 says that one of the kneeling officers in the front row is holding a whistle , which was used to tell the men when the photograph was about to be taken to make sure they were all looking in the same direction			0
in fact , mrs @entity165 's father is the source of some of the more persistent rumours about the photograph			0
he is pictured in a row of four men , all with their arms crossed , all holding hands			0
one myth is that the group was a father and three brothers , all of whom died the following day , which is false			0
rule ( back right ) pictured with a group at training before he was deployed to @entity98 @entity96 returned to @entity16 where he had eight children , including @entity165 ( pictured ) who has been working on finding the stories of those in the photograph			1
he is pictured in 1966 at the age of 75 , three years before he died mrs @entity165 says that she and her sister were once visiting @entity240 in @entity5 and saw the photograph for sale in a shop			2
' one shop told us that they [ her father and the three other men ] were all from that town and they all died			0
' ' i do wonder what that was about and i wish i 'd asked him when he was alive , ' she said			0
the @entity158 have launched an appeal to identify the remaining soldiers in the photograph			0
they are asking for people who may have had relatives in the @entity132 to send in information and have created a grid and numbering system so that each person is easy to identify			0
mrs @entity165 , who has been conducting research about the wartime experiences of some of the men in the photograph , could then send the relatives some information about their ancestor and what they went through in the war			2
' i think it would be so exciting [ to discover your relative in the photograph ] because whenever i see an old photo of one of my ancestors i always get so excited and such an iconic photo as it is , you 'd be even more flabbergasted , it would be phenomenal , ' she said			0
do you know anyone in the iconic @entity3 picture ? @entity287 on @entity288 @entity16 @entity3 troops charging near a @entity291 trench in the @entity293 campaign in @entity3 an @entity16 soldier carries a wounded comrade during the @entity100 campaign a landing force at @entity100 leaves transport ships for the shore a @entity291 sniper , disguised as a bush is taken into custody after being captured by @entity108 troops			1
