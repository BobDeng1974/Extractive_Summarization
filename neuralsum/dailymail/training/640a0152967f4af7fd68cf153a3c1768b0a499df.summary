a note he left for his stockbroker parents read : ' please do not under any circumstances try to find me			2
' that 15 - year - old was @entity10 , who would rise from fledgling juggler to a legendary showman and become synonymous with the world of the circus			1
now , to celebrate 50 years in showbusiness , the renowned @entity10 's @entity15 has been brought back for one last time with the spectacular 50 acts in 100 minutes - including @entity18 and @entity19 , the blindfolded high - wire walkers ; @entity21 the crossbow champion ; @entity23 ; and @entity24 the clown			1
mr @entity10 established his eponymous @entity26 in 1974 and ran it until 2003 , at which point he retired and bought tourist attraction @entity28 in @entity30			1
do n't look so sad , @entity24 ... @entity32 ( aka @entity31 ) looks on wistfully as he prepares for the @entity26 spectacular during its stop in @entity34 , @entity30 ... @entity10 's back in town ! to celebrate 50 years in showbusiness , the world - famous @entity10 's @entity15 has been brought back for one last time with 50 acts in 100 minutes			1
mr @entity10 ( above ) ran away 50 years ago to join the circus the cast of @entity10 's circus which is on a national tour until july 23 mr @entity10 - who began his career as a juggler in the 1960s - rehearses with the cast @entity10 , seen on stilts , in the late 60s as he established himself as a master showman the show , which runs until july 23 , has embarked on a national tour with its final performance in @entity50 , @entity51			1
and its particular brand of entertainment is a reflection of the love mr @entity10 has for an industry he was enchanted by since the age of eight - when he sat wide - eyed during a visit to @entity59 in @entity60 , west @entity61			1
after later running away from his south - west @entity61 home , he became an apprentice at the @entity64 ’ circus , where he trained as a juggler			1
one year later , in 1962 , he learned more of the business side of the operation with @entity15			2
there , he also honed his skills in tenting , clowning and animal grooming			2

in spite of this , mr @entity10 made the decision that was to set him on the path to success and , four years later , @entity10 's @entity15 was born			2
with years of experience , an eye for stunts , canny marketing and a gift for showmanship , his @entity26 was a huge success			1
by 1976 , he was running two shows , which gave rise to several permutations : @entity10 ’s @entity59 , @entity124 and @entity126 ’s @entity125 , @entity124 and @entity126 ’s ' @entity127 and @entity10 ’s @entity128			2
at its peak , his arenas seated 1,500 and required 150 truck to transport the show			2
however , the 1980s saw a growing backlash by the public against the use of animals in circus acts			1
although he won a case against @entity140 regarding the use of wild animals in his shows , he sold his last elephant by 1993 and toured with a non-animal circus			1
in the mid- 1990s , he also managed the @entity146 and @entity147			2
@entity10 ’s most radical departure came in 1995 when he launched the @entity149 at @entity150 , inspired by @entity153 circus @entity151			1
in 2003 , @entity10 decided to retire from the travelling entertainment world and bought @entity28 in @entity30 , transforming it into a mixed entertainment complex including a circus museum , daily circus shows and other attractions			1

the next year , when i had picked up some juggling skills , i was on £ 9 a week			2
i had the same contract with a few new figures scribbled over the top of the old ones			2
this was in the days of ' no play , no pay '			2
so if a show was cancelled because bad weather had ruined the ground - which was quite common - it meant starving or making sure you had saved a bit from the week before			1
what was your @entity210 ? twice i 've bought farms that have turned into big money later on			1
my best move was buying a farm in @entity215 as the winter @entity216 for the circus for £ 40,000			1
we lived there for 30 years and sold it for £ 3m			0
the @entity221 had not been built when we arrived there in 1975			0
and your worst ? taking the circus to @entity223 during the revolution in 1979			1
we 'd been booked by the general of the @entity223 army and were not paid the promised deposit			0
we 'd already booked the acts , including ice - skating chimps from @entity230 , and loaded our equipment on the boats when i realised			1
there was a 6pm curfew which meant no one was allowed to leave their homes			0
we never got paid , ran out of money and had to do a midnight flit from our hotel			0
@entity190 did you pay for your first home ? i bought a converted ambulance when i was 17			1
it cost £ 17.50 but i had terrible trouble getting it insured because i was so young and in showbusiness			0
i shared it with an @entity250 chair balancer called @entity251			0
the only peace i got was when he fell in love with a fish and chip shop owner in @entity256 and would go and visit her			0
my first non-mobile home was the farm i mentioned earlier			0
how many credit cards are in your wallet ? two			0
one personal and one for business use for my spooky caves attraction , @entity28 in @entity30			1
do you prefer to pay by @entity266 ? cash , definitely			0
i used to buy everything with cash and still like to now if i can			0
how much cash do you have in your wallet ? a couple of hundred pounds most of the time			0
how are you saving for your retirement ? i never really want to retire			0
i 've given up on pensions as i believe they are grey - suited robbers			1
i 've lost a lot of money over the years			0
if i had relied on my pension i would be in financial difficulty now			0
continuing to work and invest in my business paid off for me			0
my main investment is @entity28			1
i have a five - year plan which includes building a hotel in a couple of years			1
@entity10 's @entity59 , pictured yesterday , in @entity34 , @entity30 what was your most @entity288 ? the world 's biggest caravan			1
it cost £ 20,000 in 1976 , which is equivalent to about £ 200,000 now			0
it was 55ft long and had seven rooms - i wanted everyone in the family to have their own room			1
it was over-indulgent not only because of the price , which was crazy for a caravan in those days , but also because it was a nightmare to travel around in			0
it could n't even fit through most park gates			0
i 've caused a few traffic jams in my time			0
i also bought the world 's longest car - a 75ft cadillac with full - size @entity307			1
it was too long to drive and in the end i just put it on a trailer to showcase it			0
what was the biggest tip you 've ever given ? i gave $ 1,000 once in @entity317 when i was buying a caravan - but it was a mistake			1
i 'd just arrived from @entity320 and was still thinking in @entity320 dollars			0
i thought the tip was about £ 100 but it was actually more than £ 400			0
another time i gave four @entity324 ponies to an @entity326 circus family who were buying horses from us			2
it was a goodwill gesture which made a real bond between our families			0
i still get invited to stay with them whenever i am in @entity334			0
and the @entity335 ? an old circus boss taught me very young that when negotiating a deal you should let the other side offer first as very often it 's less than you imagine			2
often a farmer renting a field will suggest a lower amount than you thought he 'd want			0
@entity344 also told me to ' follow the big boys '			0
he meant watch what the big entertainment companies such as @entity348 did , even down to the colour of their costumes			0
they 've spent millions on research and marketing so they must know what they are doing .			0

world - famous circus king established his @entity26 in 1974
he retired in 2003 and bought @entity30 tourist attraction @entity28
other acts on bill include @entity367 on wheels - ten on one bike ; and @entity369 on @entity370
