by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 6 july 2012 updated : 08:56 est , 6 july 2012 for most of her life @entity1 was self - conscious about her body ; she hated her flat @entity5 chest and longed to be curvy and shapely like other women she knew			1
so , after years of saving to pay for the cosmetic surgery she was desperate for , the mother - f - four was delighted with the results of the procedure that left her with the body she 'd longed for			0
for the first time ever she had boobs she loved and she finally felt like the woman she ’d always wanted to be			2
but her joy soon turned to despair as the breast implants she had paid £ 3,750 for began slowly killing her			1
@entity1 at home over @entity21 in 2009			1
it was one of the last pictures taken of her before she died			2
her heart failed following tb treatment @entity1 before and after her operation : she was delighted with her larger breasts but came to regret having the surgery now , the four children she left behind – @entity31 , 21 , @entity32 , 19 , @entity33 , 15 , and six - year - old @entity34 – wish she had never gone for surgery			1
@entity31 said : ' @entity36 was happiest after she had her boob job			1
she loved feeling womanly and curvy and it made her really confident			0
but before long she fell ill and never recovered			0
' @entity36 suffered for years after having the operation and she regretted having it done			1
' she even had a mastectomy but it was too late by then			2
she wanted other women to know it was n’t worth it			1
' @entity31 was eight when @entity1 , from @entity46 , @entity47 , had saved enough for a breast enlargement			1
@entity1 ’s mother @entity49 , 61 , remembers the day in 1999 her daughter called to tell her she was going ahead with the operation			1
' my heart sank , ' recalls @entity49			2
' but i knew it was something she had wanted since she was a teenager and she ’d been saving for years			2
' @entity1 ’s operation in @entity47 transformed her into a curvy @entity57 and she was delighted with the results			1
@entity49 remembers her being so happy she cried			0
' she said she felt like a real woman at last and her confidence blossomed			0
she had a photo shoot done and it was the first time she had ever liked a picture of herself , ' she added			0
@entity1 ( left ) when she was in hospital just before she died			1
right - with her daughter @entity31 when she was little @entity1 with her daughter @entity31 who said that in the end her mother knew her breast implants had n't been worth it two years after the operation , @entity1 met her husband - to - be , security guard @entity70			1
but 18 months later , she developed a cough and a chest x-ray revealed she had tuberculosis , a serious lung infection			0
doctors were not sure how she ’d caught it , but one theory was the disease had laid dormant in her body until the implants were inserted			1
@entity49 explains : ' we were all worried , but @entity1 told us not to be			1
she took it in her stride and said the medication would clear it up			0
none of us thought for a minute it would end up killing her			0
' the cough did clear up and @entity1 and @entity70 started planning their wedding with @entity31 due to be a bridesmaid			1
but one morning , @entity1 called @entity49 distraught saying that her implant had just exploded			1
' she was on her way to work when she felt a pop in her chest and then blood and fluid had started seeping out of an open wound on her breast			2
' i told her to drive straight to hospital			0
' missing mum : @entity31 today with her grandmother @entity49 ( right )			0
they said @entity1 's breasts robbed her of so much			1
left - a poem @entity31 read at her mother 's funeral @entity108 is primarily a disease of the lungs that can spread to other organs and can be fatal if left untreated			1
about 90 per cent of people who get infected with @entity108 develop a latent @entity108 infection , which means the infecting bacteria are alive in the body , but inactive			1
people who have latent infections do not have tb symptoms and can not spread the infection to others			0
however , about five per cent of latent @entity108 become active tb in the first year , and about five to 15 per cent after that			2
@entity108 becomes latent when an infected person ’s immune system is n't strong enough to keep the infectious bacteria in check			1
it breaks out of walled off lesions known as ' tubercles ' that can survive for decades			0
this could explain why @entity1 's @entity108 emerged about her breast surgery			1
in the last 20 years @entity108 cases have gradually increased in the @entity131 , particularly among ethnic minority communities originally from places where @entity108 is widespread			2
source : http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tuberculosis / it was bad news			0
the @entity108 infection was back and it had eaten away at the scar tissue , causing the implant to burst			2
the risk of infection was serious and @entity1 was told to have the implants taken out			1
call - centre worker @entity31 recalls : ' @entity36 tried so hard to smile on her wedding day but she kept crossing her arms because the dress no longer fitted her chest and it was gaping open			2
' after the operation , @entity1 ’s confidence crumbled and she admitted she felt like a freak without her implants			1
finally , a year later , she got the all - clear to have them replaced			0
' i remember @entity36 laughing and joking and letting us all have a squeeze because she had her boobs back , ' says @entity31			2
' she was over the moon and said everything would get back to normal now			0
' only it was n’t to be because just a few months after the second operation , accounts worker @entity1 ’s other boob popped open and the implants had to be removed for a second time			1
this time she was left with scarring across both boobs and an open wound on her right			0
tests also revealed the devastating news that @entity1 had caught @entity171 while she was in hospital			2
it meant yet more medication but , finally , @entity1 beat it and she decided to have another baby with @entity70			2
family tragedy : @entity1 pictured with her youngest daughter @entity177 ( left ) her mother @entity49 and daughters @entity31 and @entity180 funeral : @entity1 who died after a series of complications which was triggered by her boob job @entity177 was born in june 2005 and @entity1 was advised it was safe to breast - feed her			1
but within a matter of months their happiness was destroyed when doctors told @entity1 that the @entity108 had returned and then discovered a lump in her breast			1
@entity31 says : ' at first we feared cancer but tests showed that it was scar tissue from all of the breast operations that was turning septic			2
' it meant that @entity36 might end up getting blood poisoning and die			2
' @entity1 was advised to have her left breast completely removed but , instead , she begged surgeons to remove them both			1
@entity49 explains : ' she ’d been through so much by then she did n’t care anymore			0
she wanted them gone so she could get well again and get back to being a good wife and mum			0
” @entity1 in her late teens : she was never happy with her flat - chest the following week , @entity1 had a double mastectomy			1
' it was a big operation but she still had n’t lost her sense of humour , ' says @entity31			0
before she went home , the hospital gave @entity1 a specially made mastectomy bra with built - in pads to look like breasts			1
' she had us in stitches when she would ask one of us to ‘ go and get my boobs ’ , ' says @entity31			0
' sometimes my little sister would put the pads on , which made us all laugh			0
' @entity224 was just three when @entity1 started coughing again and her family feared the @entity108 was back			1
she had tubes fitted into her chest to pump in medication but it did n’t seem to help and tests showed that she had grown resistant to all the drugs			0
doctors were left with just one option : to remove part of her lung			0
@entity49 recalls : ' i went in with her to hospital the night before the operation and lay on the bed with her eating sweets and watching tv			0
' she turned to me and asked if she was going to be ok and it was the first time i ’d ever seen her look scared			0
' of course you will ’ , i told her			0
‘ you always are ’			0
' five days after the operation @entity1 was allowed home			2
the procedure appeared to have been a success			0
but a month on , @entity1 started bleeding during the night and @entity70 quickly rushed her into hospital			1
for the first two nights she seemed stable but on the third morning , january 12 , 2010 , @entity49 called and was given the devastating news that @entity1 had passed away			2
' i was actually on my way to see her			0
i said they must have the wrong person			0
i dropped the phone and thought i was going to collapse , ' she says			0
@entity49 asked @entity1 ’s sister to go to @entity31 ’s office and break the news			2
at the hospital , the family was told @entity1 had died of internal bleeding			1
an artery in her heart had collapsed under the @entity264 was only 40 and her body just could n’t take it any more			1
@entity31 made sure her mother 's fake breasts were in her coffin when she was cremated			0
' she never went anywhere without them so i know she would have liked that , ' she says			0
' @entity36 never really blamed her boobs for all that happened to her , even though her health only went downhill after she had the chest implants			1
' they made her so happy , but in the end she knew it was n’t worth it			0
her boobs robbed her of so much			0
' but they also robbed us of the most loveliest mum we could have wished for and we miss her			0
' @entity36 wanted bigger boobs but they killed her – we ’d do anything to have her back the way she was			1
