by @entity0 published : 06:34 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 09:54 est , 26 december 2012 wives – want to keep your husband happy ? the secrets are to obey him , avoid nagging , not spend any money on yourself and not to let him catch you curling your hair			1
he does not want to hear any news of his mother - in - law , only about his own mother			1
and if he is lying in bed , ill , for heaven ’s sake do not fuss around him in a silk dress , else it will rustle and annoy him			1
such invaluable advice apparently rescued many a marriage in days gone by			1
advice : the @entity20 from october 19 1893 , left , warned women that nothing annoys man more than ' to be urged to tell , when he does n't want to ' while the @entity24 , right , carried a headline ' @entity27 's advice to wives in march 1832 the tips were a regular feature in a series of local newspapers published daily or weekly across @entity33 in the 1800s and early 1900s			1
now they have been brought together in a set of articles unearthed by the @entity38 , a @entity40 project to preserve 40million pages from historical newspapers			1
from the digitised newspaper pages , researchers have found what can only be considered offensive articles by modern standards , with advice for wives ranging from , ‘ do n’t expect new dresses all the time ’ , to warning them : ‘ do n’t mope and cry because you are ill - women should never be ill. ’ the @entity54 , on october 12 , 1895 , told its female readers : ‘ do n’t argue with your husband ; do whatever he tells you and obey all his orders			1
do n’t worry him for money and do n’t expect a new dress oftener than he offers to buy you one			2
do n’t sit up till he comes home from the club ; better be in bed and pretend to be asleep			2
if you must be awake , seem to be glad he came home early			2
he ’ll probably think you an idiot ; but that ’s inevitable anyway			2
’ collection : the @entity38 has put together a collection of articles from the 1800s and early 1900s offering advice on how to be a good wife			1
the @entity54 from october 12 1895 is pictured , left , and the @entity76 from august 1 1930 is pictured right another pearl of wisdom from the same ‘ advice to wives ’ column was : ‘ do n’t answer back ; do n’t spend money on yourself , do n’t do anything he does n’t want you to do			2
then , if you are not a happy woman , your husband at least will be comfortable			1
’ the @entity24 of monday , march 7 , 1932 , carried a front page report headlined : ‘ @entity27 ’s advice to wives ’ , in which dr @entity92 , the vicar of @entity93 , @entity94 , said during a @entity97 sunday sermon : ‘ long faces and nagging did not get you your husband , and long faces and nagging will not keep them			1
’ the advice was often published alongside news stories about train crashes , crime stories and political scandals			0
in an article entitled ‘ how to keep a husband ’ , the @entity20 of october 19 , 1893 , counselled wives not to ask too many questions , advising : ‘ nothing annoys him more than to be urged to tell , when he does n’t want to ’ , and : ‘ nothing disgusts a man sooner than to learn that the girl who charmed him by her daintiness and attractiveness has developed into a wife who affects wrappers and curl - papers			1
’ historic wisdom : the @entity122 from april 13 1940 , left , and @entity123 from march 7 1932 , right on january 19 , 1834 , the @entity123 warned wives nursing their sick husbands not to try cheering them up ‘ by repeating gossip , or by telling him that coal has risen 10s , and that your coal cellar is empty ’ , adding : ‘ do n’t wear your newest and most rustling silk dress or , if you do , do n’t fuss about the room more than you can help ’			0
in the @entity76 , in @entity134 , the following tips to ‘ young wives ’ were offered on august 1 , 1930 : ‘ after you marry him - study him			0
if he is secretive – trust him			0
when he is talkative – listen to him			0
if he is jealous – cure him			0
if he favours society – accompany him			0
' let him think you understand him – but never let him think you manage him			0
’ of course , it takes two to make a successful marriage , and the @entity122 and @entity141 helpfully offered this advice to husbands in its edition of april 13 , 1940 : ‘ do you still court your wife , bring her an occasional gift of flowers and remember her birthday and the wedding anniversary ? remember these and she will darn your socks			0
’ @entity153 , of the @entity154 , said : ‘ these outrageous advice columns seem funny to us now , but at the time such advice was taken quite seriously by those who read them			0
‘ reviewing newspaper articles from the past is a great way to track social attitudes towards gender roles , politics and popular opinion , and these articles are among many gems to be found in the archives			0
’ between now and 2021 , millions of old newspaper pages will be uploaded for public view on the project ’s website www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk .			0
