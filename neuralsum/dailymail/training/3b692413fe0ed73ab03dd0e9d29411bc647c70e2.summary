by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 22 november 2013 @entity2 : 20:34 est , 22 november 2013 @entity0 admires the fashion senses of @entity4 ( pictured )			1
but the size 8 mum struggles to fit into her clothes ever looked at @entity4 ’s clothes and wished you could raid her vast wardrobe , just for a day ? me too			1
i ’ve recently started to admire @entity13 ’s fashion sense			2
only one small problem - small being the operative word			2
even though i ’m a size 8 - 10 , i fear squeezing into @entity4 ’s frocks would be a stretch too far			1
so when i heard the @entity19 were giving away clothes to raise money for the @entity22 , i knew it was my chance not only to support a worthwhile cause , but finally to see if i could fit into @entity4 ’s frocks			1
my daughter , @entity26 , 14 , who is a slim size 6 , is just as excited			1
‘ make sure you buy something i could wear @entity30 ! ’ she says , before going to school			1
and so i queued up outside the @entity34 @entity33 shop in @entity35 , @entity36 , yesterday , elbows sharpened , to see what i could get my hands on			1
‘ remember this is a charity shop			2
it ’s for a good cause , so no squabbling ’ , says the woman on the door			2
inside there are rails of cast - offs from @entity48 — but sadly it ’s fashion @entity50 in there			2
where are the iconic @entity54 gowns or the @entity56 body - cons ? most of the items look like tat from the early noughties			1
there ’s cami tops , cowboy boots and flared jeans as far as the eye can see			2
then there ’s a pair of red @entity69 heels that i recognise from @entity4 ’s back catalogue — these 4in beauties would have cost her £ 700 — some orange @entity75 and some pretty ghastly boots from her @entity77 days			1
there is also a white @entity69 tuxedo , previously modelled by @entity81 that i pause over ... but no , my husband would kill me			2
in the end , i manage to get my hands on five of her designer cast - offs but , up close , @entity4 ’s clothes look even more childishly proportioned — after all , she has a legendary 23in waist			1
so will they really fit me , or is the only person who stands a chance of getting into them my teenage daughter ? this frock is an actual size four - also known as the mythical size zero			1
like the giant panda , i have never seen one in the flesh before			2
it takes me ten minutes of crowbarring to get it on and even then , as you can see ( left ) , i could n’t do up the side zip - not even close			2
i ’ve barely got one boob in it and am aware my tummy is hanging out			2
i do n’t know how @entity4 does it - the woman must be built like a pencil ! but @entity26 looks wonderful in this dress			1
it is a little big around the bust , but that ’s to be expected considering that @entity4 has had some help in this area			1
otherwise , it ’s a perfect fit			0
the leather feels wonderfully soft , but sadly , the good news stops there			0
it ’s so small i can barely dip my toe into this skirt , let alone fit it round my waist			0
it would be better worn as a sleeve			0
my ego is plummeting as i really expected to be able to get more of these clothes on			1
this skirt could have looked so elegant on me ... even @entity26 struggles to get into it , which is claimed to be a size eight			1
i had to help zip her into it and she could barely walk because it was so tight			0
i find it extraordinary that a grown woman can fit into something a 14 - year - old ca n’t			1
this has the potential to be an elegant dress , but it is just absurdly small			0
it has no size in the label , for which i ’m almost thankful , but it ca n’t be any bigger than a size 4			1
i ’ve never seen anything like it			0
as i struggle in , i think this that just ca n’t be meant for adults			0
incredibly , i get it on but it rides up unbearably high on my thigh , thanks to my stomach stretching it in the wrong direction			0
the whole thing is so narrow and sheer it feels like slipping into a pair of tights			0
i ’m thrilled to get it on - but devastated by my reflection			0
obviously , @entity26 looks amazing			1
it fits her perfectly - which is unbelievable			0
i ca n’t imagine what @entity4 looks like in real life if my tiny teenager can fit into her clothes			1
she clearly does n’t have hips , never mind a muffin top			0
i do n't have the best legs in the world , but i thought i might be in with a shot with these jeans			0
i ’m a 28in waist and these say 24in , but they do look stretchy			0
not stretchy enough , it turns out			0
i ca n’t get them above my thighs			0
this brand is one of @entity13 ’s favourite - i must have seen 40 identical pairs at the sale			0
then @entity26 puts them on and i am blown away			1
her legs look phenomenal and she reminds me of a @entity190 siren			0
mysteriously , this top does n’t have a label			0
it looks like a one - off , with exposed wobbly seams , but the highest quality lace embellishments			0
i would n’t be surprised if one of @entity13 ’s designer friends knocked this up			0
i just manage to get into it , but the cup size is outrageously small			2
how do @entity4 ’s ginormous boobs fit in this ? it looks dated on @entity26 ( right ) , though it fits her perfectly .			1

@entity0 was *delighted* to buy some of @entity4 *'s* clothes
but has had to admit that the items look better on her daughter @entity26 , 14
size 4 *mrs* @entity4 *donated* clothes to the @entity34 @entity33 this week
