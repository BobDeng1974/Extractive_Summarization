the @entity7 , part of the @entity9 , announced tuesday that it had ' rediscovered ' a 6,500 - year - old human skeleton believed to have been a well - muscled man of at least 50 , who stood 5 feet , 9 inches tall			1
the remains were originally excavated from southern @entity13 around 1930			1
museum officials said the complete human skeleton had been stored in a coffin - like box in one of their rooms for the last 85 years			2
what do we have here ? : scientists at the @entity7 say they have uncovered a 6,500 - year - old skeleton of a 50 - ish man in a coffin - like box in a basement storage room for the last 85 years - with no catalog card or identifying information boo : the remains of this man , dating back to about 4400 @entity34 and found in what is now southern @entity13 in 1930 , have been ' rediscovered ' ancient : the skeleton has been nicknamed ' @entity38 ' because records show the man survived an epic flood up - close : the remains were originally excavated from southern @entity13 around 1930 examining : @entity43 , the curator - in - charge of the anthropology section at the @entity7 , discusses recently rediscovered 6,500 - year - old human remains mint condition : the skeleton originally was discovered in 1929 - 30 by sir @entity50 's joint excavation team from the @entity7 and the @entity51 in @entity52 all traces of its original identifying documentations have been lost , but the museum were not worried			1
a records digitization project was recently undertaken , with @entity9 researchers , working with a team from the @entity51 , determining the remains were first unearthed at the site of @entity62 , an ancient city near modern - day @entity63 , around 1929 - 1930			2
the major archaeological project was lead by sir @entity50			1
they excavated nearly 50 feet to reach a site that became known as ' the @entity68 '			0
during the excavation , the team hit a layer of silt , which @entity50 referred to as the ' flood layer ' , because it was ten - feet deep in some places but still technically up sea level			2
he determined that the original site of @entity62 had been a small island in a surrounding marsh			0
then a great flood covered the land in the @entity81 - era			0
some 48 graves were dug up			0
the discovery : historical photos show how the skeleton was originally discovered during a 50 - feet dig in southern @entity13 transport : workers carry the incredible find out of the digging site in 1929/1930 leader : @entity91 archaeologist @entity50 ( 1880 - 1960 ) during his excavations at @entity62 in 1922 - 34 however the only skeleton in good enough condition to recover was the one now found at the @entity7			1
the bones and surrounding soil was coated in wax and the entire skeleton was shipped to @entity52 , then on to @entity4			1
skeletons of the same time period , particularly complete remains , are extremely rare , the @entity9 researchers said			2
they hope a modern skeletal analysis will reveal more about the population 's diet , stresses and ancestral origins that were unable in @entity50 's time			0
dr. @entity43 , the curator - in - charge of the anthropology section of the @entity7 , had known the box was in storage for as long as she had been in charge , but it remained a mystery			0
deep down : an historic map shows how far underground the diggers went at the ' @entity116 ' there was no catalog card or identifying number			0
researchers were n't able to determine its significance until the recent digitization of records			0
the effort enabled the researchers to link the skeleton to the field records of @entity50			2
because the skeleton had survived an epic flood leading @entity9 researches have appropriately nicknamed their re-discovery ' @entity38 '			1
the @entity7 collection houses more than 150,000 bone specimens from throughout human history			0
however a museum spokesman told @entity136 there are no current plans to exhibit ' @entity38 '			0
exhibition : there are currently no plans to put the skeleton on display at the @entity7 , part of the @entity9 , in @entity4			1
