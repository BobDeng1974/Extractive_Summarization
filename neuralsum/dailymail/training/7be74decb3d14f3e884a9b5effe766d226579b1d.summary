by @entity0 published : 09:10 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 13:07 est , 8 november 2013 what do you do when you 're a multi-millionaire @entity3 superstar and you feel like treating yourself ? get another expensive car , of course , and no matter if , judging by @entity10 striker @entity9 's bulging keyring , your garage is pretty full already			1
earning £ 180,000 a week ( before bonuses ) , the 30 - year - old @entity12 's got to spend it on something , and given the £ 61,000 price tag of the car in the brochure he 's reading , he could easily afford a couple			1
you want another one ? laughing @entity21 shares a table with @entity9 and his packed keyring @entity25 of cars : @entity27 and @entity9 , seen today in @entity28 , have several luxury motors to choose from @entity30 , right , and @entity21 are both car - mad , but @entity21 's collection is smaller since he retired from football new car : the glossy brochure contained information about the £ 61,000 @entity37 @entity30 was spotted in an @entity39 coffee shop with football pundit @entity21 perusing a luxury car catalogue featuring the @entity37			1
given that the @entity42 car firm sponsors his team , he unlikely to have to pay for it himself			0
a sport performance car that can reach 62mph in four - and - a - half seconds , it would join a stable of at least half a dozen expensive cars already littering the @entity9 driveway			0
and it would be one of his cheaper runabouts , judging by the fobs on the table which belonged to a @entity56 , a @entity57 and an @entity58 , worth at least £ 155,000			1
the £ 12.2 milion - a - year footballer is most often seen out in one of two porsches : either the sleek , gunmetal grey @entity63 ( £ 63,000 ) , or , when he 's with his wife @entity27 and their two children , the larger @entity66 2007 ( £ 125,000 )			2
for trips to the supermarket , mrs @entity67 likes to drive a white @entity70 with personalised numberplate ( around £ 44,000 ) , or sometimes the dark grey @entity57 ( £ 52,000 )			2
when they 're out without their children they take the black @entity76 ( £ 40,000 ) , which was recently photographed with a parking ticket after they left it at a station car park without buying a ticket when they nipped into @entity82			0
the footballing friends cracked a smile for the camera when they realised they had been recognised in the cafe the @entity10 striker clutched the car brochure between his teeth as he headed for his car which car did i bring ? @entity9 heads into the car park after his quick drink with @entity21 one of the fleet : this £ 125,000 @entity66 2007 is one of @entity9 's bigger cars one of the fleet : this £ 125,000 @entity66 2007 is one of @entity9 's bigger cars the footballer and his wife , @entity27 , are often pictured in this £ 60,00 @entity63 ( with @entity102 ) @entity30 picked the right person to discuss cars with - @entity21 shares his passions for motors , and boasted a collection of glamorous cars including a @entity56 , @entity110 and @entity109 when he was a £ 30,000 - a - week star in the @entity3			1
but the former @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 midfielder reduced his collection after he retired two years ago			0
he now drives a slightly more modest £ 60,000 @entity116 , and last year was spotted buying a 10 - year - old @entity117 for £ 300 at a car auction			0
the wife 's car : this £ 44,000 white @entity70 has a numberplate personalised for @entity123 van @entity67 @entity125 's @entity124 is worth £ 40,000 , so the parking ticket would have been a drop in the ocean			0

@entity130 puts expensive car keys on table as he chats to @entity21
@entity30 , who earns £ 12.2 million a year , already has stable of luxe cars
seen in @entity39 cafe reading up about £ 61,000 @entity37
the van persie garage already boasts two porsches , a @entity70 , @entity58 , @entity37 , @entity57 and retro @entity140
