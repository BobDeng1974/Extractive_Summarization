the post-war trend for each generation to be richer than the last may be coming to a halt , they said			2
workers aged from 34 to 53 are being punished by inadequate pay rises , dire pensions and crippling housing costs			1
with meagre savings , their only hope of a comfortable retirement is a large inheritance			1
' the economic fate of the 1960s and 1970s cohorts may be relatively dependent on the fortunes of their parents , ' says a report published today by the @entity23			1
a study published today by the influential @entity23 found workers aged from 34 to 53 are being punished by the current economic climate ( picture posed by models ) just 28 per cent of people born in the early 1940s have had , or expect to have , an inheritance			1
for those born in the late 1970s , the figure jumps to 70 per cent			2
the report also found that family finances have been battered over the past decade			1
between 1974 and 2002 , households saw income – earnings and benefits – grow by an annual average of 1.5 per cent			0
since then the rise has been a paltry 0.1 per cent a year			0
the @entity23 says the household income of 1960s children was typically £ 615 a week by the age of 40			1
but those born in the 1970s are on only £ 570 a week , adjusted for inflation			0
home ownership is also on the wane , the @entity23 said , with the picture being ' strikingly different ' across the generations			1
two thirds of @entity51 born in the 1940s were on the property ladder by the age of 40			0
the same is true for less than half of those born in the 1970s			0
( file picture ) economists have warned children of the 1960s and 1970s will be worse off than their parents when they retire ( file picture ) the report found home ownership is also on the wane , with the picture being ' strikingly different ' across the generations the @entity23 says the household income of children born in the 1970s is only £ 570 a week , adjusted for inflation young workers think their retirement plans will be rescued by a large inheritance , the @entity23 found			1
of the richest third of people aged 30 to 39 , a total of 35 per cent expect to pick up at least £ 100,000			2
for those currently in their 50s , the figure falls to just 10 per cent			0
the institute 's researchers said it was ' a natural consequence of the sustained economic growth seen over the post-war period ' – with each generation having more wealth to pass on than the one before			1
even among the poorest third of society , 12 per cent aged 30 to 34 , and 9 per cent aged 35 to 39 , expect to inherit £ 100,000 or more			1
@entity89 , head of pensions research at advisers @entity91 , said : ' the reliance on inheritance looks like a recipe for disappointment			2
' where a man expects to inherit £ 100,000 or more , there is a one in two chance his spouse expects to receive the same amount			0
the report says a ' rapid switch ' away from well - funded company pension funds has hurt those born in the 1960s and 1970s			2
their parents were often big beneficiaries of such schemes			0
in conclusion , the institute warns : ' individuals born in the 1960s and 1970s have no higher take - home income , have saved no more previous take - home income , are less likely to own a home and are likely to have lower private pension wealth			0
' they will also tend to find that their state pensions replace a smaller proportion of prior earnings than is the case for those currently above , or around , the state pension age			0
' @entity127 , one of the report 's authors , said : ' since the @entity131 , successive cohorts have enjoyed higher incomes and living standards than their parents			1
' yet the incomes and wealth of those born in the 1960s and 1970s look no higher than the cohorts who came before them			0
' as a result , younger cohorts are likely to have to rely on inheritances to be better off in retirement than their predecessors			2
' but inheritances are unequally distributed , with households that are already relatively wealthy far more likely to benefit			0
' prospects for those in their teenage years or 20s could be even worse			1
a report by the @entity150 , which was appointed by @entity151 , says they are on track to become the first in more than a century to be materially less well off in adulthood than their parents			2
@entity156 , of the @entity157 , which campaigns for fairness for future generations , said those ' unlucky enough ' to be born after 1970 were suffering from the combined effects of ' intergenerational unfairness '			0
but @entity162 , a leading pensions expert , said she was sceptical about the findings and said there were ' false expectations ' as to how poor future generations will be when they retire .			0
