by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 09:33 est , 24 november 2012 a top - of - the - range @entity1 which was famously crashed by @entity2 in a @entity4 tunnel three years ago is being sold for just £ 40,000 - because it is still a wreck			1
the @entity7 and @entity8 striker , who was then playing for @entity9 , smashed the 205mph @entity1 into a tunnel wall outside @entity4 in 2009			1
and no efforts have been made to repair the smashed - up sports car since the embarrassing incident			0
wreck : the @entity1 crashed by footballer @entity2 in a @entity4 tunnel three years ago is being offered for sale in @entity17 for £ 40,000 lucky escape : @entity2 , then a @entity9 player , was fortunate to escape injury when his 205mph sports car crashed into a safety barrier and bounced off a wall superstar : the @entity25 , seen here on his return to @entity4 with @entity8 this week , had bought the @entity1 new for £ 200,000 it was shipped out of the @entity29 and has now come onto the market in @entity17 through an agent in @entity32			1
agent autos , based in the small town of @entity35 , are asking £ 40,000 for the wreck - a fraction of its £ 115,000 value			1
a four - year old model in decent condition is worth nearly three times as much as the asking price , though the seller describes it as ' repairable '			0
if fixed , the @entity46 sports car will offer blistering performance thanks to a six - litre v12 engine capable of 612bhp			1
it is capable of a top speed of 205mph and does 0 - 60mph in just 3.7 seconds			1
needs work : the sports car , on offer in @entity32 , @entity17 for a third of its book price , needs extensive repairs - including a new front wing and front left wheel three - wheeler ! the other three wheels appear in decent condition , but the nose remains crumpled under the bonnet : it 's not known if the engine will fire , but if operational , it could be valuable plush : the tan and black leather interior looks largely in tact , but the dashboard and steering column need rewiring upholstery : the two - seater might not appeal to a buyer with a family cockpit : the @entity1 is capable of 205mph and 0 - 60 in just 3.7 seconds , thanks to the six - litre v12 engine the engine , if repairable , is potentially valuable having covered just 1,860 miles			1
@entity2 bought the car new , spending £ 200,000 on it			1
but any prospective buyers will need to replace the windscreen , wing mirrors and front body panels - or they could sell the remaining parts			1
@entity2 lost control of the rear - wheel drive car in january 2009 on his way to training at @entity9 's @entity92 base and crashed into a roadside barrier before bouncing off a wall			2
the accident happened on a stretch of the @entity97 that takes traffic under the runways of @entity100 between @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103			0
what a mess : police officers inspect the damage following the crash in january 2009			0
@entity2 was on his way to training with @entity9 at @entity92 no charges : @entity2 was breathalysed by police but was not charged with any dangerous driving offences superstar : ronaldo in action for @entity7 at the 2012 @entity115 finals luckily for manager sir @entity117 , he emerged without a scratch and after being breathalysed by police , completed his journey with teammate @entity121 , who was travelling behind in his @entity122			0
an eye - witness said at the time : the front of @entity2 's car was completely mangled			2
' there was metal all over the road , and debris			0
we had to dodge our way through it			0
' @entity2 was just standing at the side of the road looking forlorn and bewildered			0
' officers from @entity137 investigated the incident but no charges were pressed			0
the @entity1 was released in 2006 amid great fanfare and intended to be the successor to the @entity143 line of powerful front - engined two - seaters			2
it was named after the @entity147 circuit where @entity1 test their new models			2
it completed the overhaul of the @entity1 range to all - aluminium shells but retained the same v12 six - litre engine as its predecessors			2
the ' @entity156 ' flappy paddle transmission , which changed gears in just 100ms , was lauded as a huge improvement			0
with the engine and chassis weight reduced , the 599 was capable of 205mph and 0 - 100 in about seven seconds			1
the price straight out of the factory was £ 193,234 .			0

the @entity1 was crashed by the football star into a @entity4 tunnel wall in 2009
now the wreck has *surfaced* in @entity17 and is for sale for £ 40,000
the @entity25 star bought it new for £ 200,000 in 2008
needs a new front end , wheels , mirrors and windscreen
@entity180 engine is capable of 205mph and 0 - 60 in 3.7 seconds
