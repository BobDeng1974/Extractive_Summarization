by @entity0 it could be the biggest crowdfunding hit in history			0
the sense sleep monitoring system can look at not only how you sleep , but also everything from noise to light in your bedroom			1
it was launched last week - and raised $ 1m in just four days			1
sense 's @entity17 takes into account all of the sensor data and variables that it monitors to generate a score out of a 100 for your previous night			1
it looks at both the environment of your bedroom , such as disturbances during the night , or your room was too bright for an ideal nights rest , as well as how you actually slept yourself			0
a pitch black room might boost your score by +10 , but a car alarm going off repeatedly might lower it -20			0
the @entity18 app will give owners a breakdown and will also look for patterns , and help you to fix whatever is preventing people from reaching 100 per cent each night			1
' in just over four short days , 7,945 of you have pledged $ 1,000,333 to receive 8,213 senses , ' said @entity42 , the inventor of the gadget			2
' i speak on behalf of the whole team at @entity46 when i say that never in our wildest dreams did we expect this and in such a short amount of time			0
' the @entity18 system produces a sleep score for each night - and even work out if the neighbour 's dog barked at 4am			2
' we spend a third of our lives asleep , and the rest of our time is completely dictated by how we slept - everything from how we eat to how we exercise , ' @entity42 , the 22 - year - old @entity60 behind the project told @entity63			2
he claims the current rash of sleep monitoring products are flawed			0
' it 's been a neglected area , but now there are a lot of apps and wearables that track our sleep			0
' however , they do n't seem to work too well			0
the @entity74 , a smartwatch developed by @entity74			0
@entity76 ( right ) raised $ 10.3m from 68,929 backers in may 2012 , making it the most popular @entity79 campaign ever			1
fledgling console maker @entity80 raised $ 8.6m from 63,416 backers in august 2012 for its @entity83 - based ' microconsole ' @entity86 's @entity85 music player and downloads store attracted $ 6.2m of pledges earlier this year			2
@entity89 raised $ 2.4m from 9,522 backers in september 2012 - before being sold earlier this year for $ 2bn to @entity91			2
' when you look at everything else , people are n't looking at why you sleep badly			0
' the sense system has two components			0
a main control ' orb ' sits on the bedside table , and is packed with sensors to monitor everything from noise to light			1
it also has a speaker to play white noise , or play an alarm in the morning			2
the app shows readings over time - so can work out what temperature you sleep best at , for instance ( left )			1
it also gives a sleep score ( right ) that takes into account all the factors of your night 's rest			0
a second gadget dubbed the ' sleep pill ' clips onto the pillow to track movement through the night			1
two can be used at the same time , allowing a couple to monitor their sleep independently - and the system can even tell which of them is snoring to keep the other awake			1
@entity42 says the key to the system is that it does n't require users to clip on wearable gadgets of put their phone in a certain place			2
the orb stays on the bedside cabinet , while a second sensor clips to the inside of a pillow , meaning the user does not have to put on any gadgets before going to sleep at night			1
' it can unobtrusively track sleep - you should have to think about it , you should just go to bed			1
' bedroom is key - but room we look at least			2
' there are all these environmental factors , but we are in the dark about them			0
' ' we can see what 's happening when you 're asleep - are there loud noises , are you sleep talking , for instance			1
' the main sensor and ' sleep pill ' which clips onto a pillow the main control orb is packed with sensors			1
@entity164 monitors the levels of light in your room			1
temperature and humidity sensors are able to detect the temperature and humidity throughout the day a particulate sensor can pollen and other material that triggers allergies			0
the second sensor , the sleep pill , has accelerometers to detect the slightest movement , and is left clipped to your pillow			1
it tells the orb how you are sleeping			0
the app tells you how well you slept , or did nâ€™t , by giving you a @entity186 each night , and analysing the historic data to work out what temperatures and humidities you sleep best at			0
the system is controlled by an app. ' you can see two main views - a breakdown of the revious night 's sleep , but also a pre-sleep test that shows a live output from the data telling you historical patterns , so what temperature you sleep best at , for instance , ' said @entity42			1
there is also a ' smart alarm ' that wake you in the morning at the right point in your sleep cycle , which experts claim avoids the ' groggy ' feeling in the morning			0
the system also has a smart alarm that can wake users up at the right time so they are most rested			0
