it 's one thing not to recognise me but the thought of him not remembering @entity7 was heartbreaking			1
' i had to show him pictures of him with myself and @entity7 and told him stories of things he had done in the days and weeks leading up to the accident to try and jog his memory			1
miss @entity8 feared her fiance would never recover from the memory loss , but he has battled back using a diary to remember his daily actions ' i told him about playing with @entity7 in the house and what he had been doing at work			1

@entity51 ( @entity51 ) affects around half of people who suffer concussion after a head injury			0
it can take many forms , of which memory loss or amnesia is just one			2
the exact cause is not agreed upon but many experts think it is a result of the brain 's chemical balance changing after the initial injury			0
doctors classify memories as immediate , such as sounds , short - term , such as telephone numbers and permanent , such as childhood recollections			0
usually , the longer - term memories return first because they are more ' consolidated ' by being re-used by the brain			0

miss @entity8 , 31 , a deputy supermarket manager , said : ' when i first turned up at the hospital he did n't even recognise me at all - that was horrible			1
' although he remembered me within a few days , for the first six months he was nothing like the man i had fallen in love with , it was horrible			0
' but i knew that i had to stick by @entity5 and together we 'd make it through			2
' mr @entity5 suffered damage to his brain 's visual cortex , causing him short - term memory loss and to forget how the incident happened			1
although his long - term memory had mostly returned within six months , @entity5 still struggled to retain day - to - day memories - and was devastated to have forgotten baby @entity7 's first birthday , despite his family filming the event			1
mr @entity5 said : ' as a parent , not remembering @entity7 's first birthday was the worst thing that could happen to anyone			1
' watching the video does n't help much as it 's just like watching someone else 's family			2

' unfortunately some people could n't understand that , although i looked normal on the outside , i was having problems inside			0
' i know now that the people who stood by me at the time are my real friends and i ca n't put into words how much that means to me			0
' that 's the only thing that 's a silver lining with my memory loss - i ca n't remember how much of a worse person i was at that time			1
' the couple were helped by therapists at brain injury charity @entity156 and have since been able to rebuild their lives			0
