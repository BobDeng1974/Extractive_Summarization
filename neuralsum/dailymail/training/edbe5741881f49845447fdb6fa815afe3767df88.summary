for @entity2 , having a daughter with @entity1 is ‘ like losing a child you still have			1
’ until she was 18 months old , @entity5 was alert , responsive and developing normally			1
yet , @entity2 , 35 , an @entity6 teacher , explains : ‘ very suddenly , the beautiful baby we knew slowly began to disappear – she was alive , but we could n’t get to her			1
’ @entity5 is now six yet has the mental capabilities of an 18 - month - old – a reality that is only too stark when she is playing with her brothers @entity12 , three , and @entity14 , who is almost two			1
close : @entity15 with sister @entity16 who died in january this year after suffering from @entity1 just like her baby brother , she frequently screams , tries to eat everything within arm ’s distance , pulls her hair ( and her brother ’s ) and finds it hard to support her own weight			1
yet now scientists may be close to eliminating the condition			1
astonishingly , @entity1 ( @entity27 ) – which also afflicted @entity15 ’s little sister , @entity16 , who died aged 14 in january – has been reversed in mice			1
one child in 12,000 is born with rs , yet few people have heard of it			1
the genetic disorder affects almost exclusively females , causing them to regress neurologically and physically			1
the progression of the disease can be roughly divided into four stages			1
during the first stage , from about the age of six to 18 months , a baby slows in development , loses interest in play , stops making eye contact , starts walking awkwardly and makes repetitive hand movements			1
slowly going : @entity46 describes life with her six - year - old daughter @entity5 , who has the mental capability of an 18 - month - old , like ' losing a child you still have ' the second stage , known as ‘ rapid destruction ’ , begins between the ages of one and four			1
the child finds it increasingly difficult to communicate and learn and there is often a deterioration in other brain functions			1
symptoms include an inability to control the hands , sudden distress teamed with screaming , unsteadiness , breathing problems , difficulty sleeping , slow head growth and digestive problems			1
the third stage , the ‘ plateau ’ , begins between age three and ten			1
limbs become floppy , epilepsy may develop and there may be weight loss and teeth - grinding			1
however , many parents say children are less distressed and show more interest in their surroundings			1
the final stage can last for decades			1
usually severe bending of the spine – scoliosis – develops , as well as losing the ability to walk			2
almost all cases are caused by a mutation in the @entity92 gene which prevents nerve cells in the brain from working properly			2
currently there is no cure and only the symptoms are treated			2
sufferers can live to their 40s but most die before 25			2
@entity2 and her husband @entity101 , 37 , from @entity102 in @entity103 , first noticed something was wrong when @entity5 started to react oddly to people ’s emotions			2
‘ her normal responses reversed – she would become very distressed when someone laughed , ’ says @entity2			2
‘ this was accompanied by screaming which was difficult to bear			2
’ there was a sudden slowing in her development , and nursery workers noticed she had started to shake occasionally			2
@entity2 and @entity101 took @entity5 to the doctor but they were reassured there was nothing wrong with her because she was reaching all her milestones , albeit slowly			2
but @entity5 continued to regress until she started to pull out her hair in handfuls			2
‘ even at this point no one could tell me what was wrong with her , ’ adds @entity2			0
‘ it was incredibly frustrating			0
’ finally , tests revealed the true cause			0
when the couple were given the news they were strictly told not to search the internet about the condition and to ‘ carry on as normal ’			0
doctors wanted to prevent them frightening themselves			0
‘ i ’m not sure i ’d have managed to get out of bed if i ’d known what lay ahead , ’ @entity2 admits			0
since then there has been a steady decline in @entity5 ’s abilities			0
she wakes throughout the night for hours at a time and needs a strict routine , otherwise she screams for long periods			0
@entity2 says : ‘ life is certainly not how i ’d envisaged it to be			0
you have to be five steps ahead of @entity5 all the time because if you do n’t foresee an upset to her routine , there can be difficult consequences			0
even if you are a few minutes late in serving up food , she will become very upset , start screaming and throw things across the room			0
you learn to appreciate the smallest things			0
one great smile from @entity5 can make your day , and you can find yourself feeling very lucky			0
’ @entity5 currently does not take any medication			0
@entity2 admits they had worried about the impact @entity5 might have on their two sons but say they are happy and adore their sister			1
until recently , neurodevelopmental conditions were thought to be irreversible			0
yet there is hope from the @entity165 research which in 2007 reversed @entity1 symptoms in mice			1
‘ that took our breath away , ’ says dr @entity168 , who led the study			0
the mice were infected with a virus that altered the gene and reversed symptoms			0
‘ mice are different from humans , but it is a very strong indicator that therapies could be developed in our lifetime , ’ says dr @entity168			0
for @entity2 , the research is the light at the end of the tunnel and she will work tirelessly to raise money until there is a therapy for @entity5			0
she says : ‘ i refuse to lose hope			0

@entity1 causes neurological and physical regression
the genetic disorder effects almost exclusively female babies
@entity199 *'s* sister @entity16 died from @entity1 earlier this year , aged 14
