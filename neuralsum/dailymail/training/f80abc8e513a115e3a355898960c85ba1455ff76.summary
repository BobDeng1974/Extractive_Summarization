by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 02:24 est , 2 october 2012 reform : @entity2 wants maths and @entity4 to be compulsory until the age of 18 @entity2 wants all schoolchildren to study @entity4 and maths until they are 18			1
the @entity8 leader will use his speech to the party ’s annual conference today to propose an alternative to the a-level , called the ‘ technical baccalaureate ’ , to address the needs of the ‘ forgotten 50 per cent ’ who do not go to university			1
aides said it would be the biggest education reform for decades			2
even those who fail @entity4 and maths at @entity21 would study the subjects as part of the ‘ gold standard ’ vocational qualification for less academic pupils			0
and a-level students who had passed with flying colours at @entity21 would have to continue to study some element of @entity4 and maths alongside their other chosen subjects			2
mr @entity2 will suggest he wants to break the dominance of the elite universities , painting a picture of a country ‘ where kids aspire not just to go to @entity37 and @entity38 but to excellent technical colleges and elite vocational institutions ’			1
he will suggest @entity42 ’s education system works for only half the country , arguing that for too long both major parties have focused too heavily on young people who go to university			0
and he will highlight his own comprehensive education in what is being billed as a highly personal speech full of ‘ class war ’ rhetoric apparently contrasting his background with that of @entity54 and @entity55			1
in what will be seen as a reference to the prime minister ’s comfortable upbringing in the shires , mr @entity2 will say : ‘ my family has n’t sat under the same oak tree for the last 500 years			1
‘ my parents came to @entity42 as immigrants , @entity66 refugees from the @entity67			0
‘ i would not be standing here today without the compassion and tolerance of our great country , @entity42 , a country that my parents saw rebuilt after the @entity73			0
’ speech : @entity2 , seen here with shadow chancellor @entity75 on stage yesterday , will propose the changes to @entity80 education as the @entity8 conference continues in @entity82 today @entity8 is attempting to overhaul mr @entity2 ’s image , casting him as a man of the people who understands the concerns of ordinary voters			1
the scale of the challenge is underlined by a poll today showing only a fifth of people think he has what it takes to be a good prime minister			0
asked whether mr @entity2 could be a good leader for the country , 22 per cent agree and 63 per cent disagree			1
for mr @entity54 , the figures are 39 per cent and 52 per cent			0
@entity8 ’s seven - point lead in the last @entity100 survey for @entity101 a month ago has also dropped to just three points , with the party on 38 per cent to the @entity104 ’ 35 per cent			0
mr @entity2 ’s schooling at @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 during the 1980s is also the focus of a @entity8 party political broadcast , dubbed ‘ @entity111 ’ , which will be screened tomorrow			2
the campaign has divided @entity8 figures , with some believing it risks backfiring as mr @entity2 ’s upbringing – as the son of @entity42 ’s leading @entity118 intellectual who was close to many senior members of the @entity8 aristocracy – was far from conventional			2
in today ’s speech , mr @entity2 will also suggest that businesses need to change their attitudes to overcome the economic crisis , condemning the ‘ short term ’ culture in parts of industry			1
and he will argue that the country has ‘ deep problems – about who @entity42 is run for , and who prospers in it , about one rule for those at the top and , too often , another rule for everyone else ’			0
but @entity138 yesterday admitted that his brother , who beat him to the @entity8 leadership , still had a ‘ mountain to climb ’ to win the next election .			0
