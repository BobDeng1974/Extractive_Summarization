by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 20:12 est , 8 february 2013 there were 2,016 confirmed cases of measles in @entity4 and @entity5 in 2012 , the highest annual total since 1994 cases of measles are at a record high , health officials have warned			1
in 2012 , there were 2,016 cases of the potentially deadly disease in babies , children and adults in @entity4 and @entity5			1
this makes it the biggest outbreak since cases were first formally recorded almost 20 years ago			1
the total is more than six times that of 2002 - and almost 40 times higher than 1998 , when just 56 cases were documented			1
with measles also rife in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , it is thought that some outbreaks were sparked by infections brought back from abroad by holidaymakers			0
vaccination of toddlers is high but there is particular concern that the disease , which is spread through coughing and sneezing , is hitting teenagers who were not given the @entity40 jab as babies			2
this will include some whose parents feared the safety of the jab , following research by dr @entity47 linking it to bowel problems and autism			0
this work has since been roundly discredited			0
there have also been small outbreaks in travelling communities			1
health experts warned that measles can kill - and needs to be taken seriously			2
dr @entity56 , head of immunisation at the @entity58 , said : ‘ @entity59 is often associated with being a disease of the past and as a result people may be unaware that it is a dangerous infection and can lead to death in severe cases			2
‘ parents should ensure their children are fully protected against measles , mumps and rubella ( @entity73 measles ) with two doses of the @entity40 vaccine			0
‘ parents of unvaccinated children , as well as older teenagers and adults who may have missed @entity40 vaccination , should make an appointment with their gp to get vaccinated			1
‘ @entity59 continues to circulate in several @entity84 countries which are popular with holidaymakers			0
’ the @entity87 , along with @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity86 , accounted for 87 per cent of the 7,392 cases that occurred in the @entity89 last year			1
in @entity87 , there have been prolonged outbreaks in @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			0
between january 2012 and the end of the january this year , there were 622 cases in and around @entity98 - and around a third of these were admitted to hospital			1
teenagers were most likely to be affected , while babies that were too young to be vaccinated made up the second biggest group			1
@entity106 is another measles hot spot , with around 100 cases in the last year , including 28 cases in the @entity110 in the past three to four weeks			2
teenagers who were not vaccinated at the routine age are at particular risk of becoming exposed to the highly infectious viral illness ( pictured ) most of these were centred on eight schools			1
health officials there plan to write to the parents of 30,000 children aged five to 16 who have n’t been vaccinated			2
in addition , a leaflet about measles has been written for travelling people , amid concerns about a rise in cases in their communities			1
@entity59 is very contagious , with one person who is ill able to infect more than 15 others , if they have n’t been vaccinated or had the virus before			2
at the beginning , someone with measles can feel like they have a bad cold , with a fever , dry cough and red , or sore , eyes			0
a few days later , a red - brown spotty rash appears			0
it usually starts behind the ears , then spreads around the head and neck before covering the body			0
potentially lethal complications include pneumonia , hepatitis and swelling of the brain around one in five who catch the bug will spend time in hospital			0
however , there have not been any deaths for several years			0
teenage spread : vaccination of toddlers is high but there is concern that the disease , which is spread through coughing and sneezing , is hitting teenagers who were not given the @entity40 jab as babies			0

2,016 confirmed cases in @entity4 and @entity5 in 2012 , the highest annual total since 1994
teenagers not vaccinated when they were younger are at particular risk of becoming exposed , say experts
several smaller spreads have also occurred in travelling communities across the @entity89
