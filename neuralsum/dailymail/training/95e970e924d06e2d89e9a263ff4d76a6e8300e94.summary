by @entity0 published : 00:31 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 6 october 2013 a disturbing @entity2 video filmed on a @entity3 in which a woman accuses a man of giving her @entity6 has been revealed as a ' prank ' posted by a @entity9 ' actress '			1
every seasoned @entity9 has at least one subway horror - story , but the altercation between the man and woman would surely reach the top of the list for most			2
the premise of the prank is a woman getting into a fight with a man on the subway because he gave her aids			1
the end of the video flashes up with a @entity40 page for a woman named @entity32			1
that page contains is a link to the video , as well as many others , described as ' pranks '			2
@entity25 describes herself as an actress on her @entity40 page and also has a @entity2 channel full of other offensive pranks , including one in which she pretends to go into labor at @entity55 ( complete with fake blood and gore ) and one in which she spits on a man presumably in on the ' joke ' and gets into a physical fight with him on a subway			1
for someone who professes to want to bring happiness to people 's lives , @entity25 has strange way of going about it			0
' hey everyone , ’ reads her @entity2 channel description			2
' welcome to @entity72 ’s channel			2

' full uncensored video can be seen here ( @entity88 ) in training : passengers must listen to this couple scream obscenities during what must have seemed like the longest subway ride ever at an early point in the latest video in response to the woman 's violent shoving , the man says , ' what are you going to do now ? you got @entity6 , you ca n't do nothing about it ... what , you going to give it to other people ? ' to which she responds , ' yeah ! i 'm going to give it to him , and him , and him , ' she says pointing out men around the packed carriage			1
other people in the carriage appear upset and uncomfortable while the couple push and slap at each other and employ some colorful language			0
confrontation : the fight continues apace ( left ) while a passenger tries to reason with the pair before giving up ( right ) the man calls the woman ' disgusting ' and forcefully grips her arms as she accuses him of giving her aids and having a ' dirty d * * k. ' the script was decidedly lackluster , consisting mostly of , ' get off me , you gave me @entity6 , ' from the woman , and ' you gave yourself @entity6 , ' from the man , interspersed with obscenities and physical violence			1
as if her idea of @entity6 being comical did n't already let on , it appears @entity25 has a fundamental misunderstanding of the illness which , if she had indeed been infected , would have manifested as @entity137 and not full - blown @entity6			0
bystanders : the man physically lifted @entity25 and tried to drag her bodily from the carriage at risk : one brave woman stepped in to try and help @entity25 , unaware the pair were playing an elaborate and distinctly unfunny prank an education : it 's unclear what @entity25 intended viewers of her video to learn as the six - minute - plus video progresses , the fight escalates to violent pushing and terrifying screaming and yelling			1
when the crowded train pulls into a station other passengers on the train gratefully move towards the doors as the couple continue their act			0
suddenly , the man grabs the woman and begins to physically carry her from the carriage as she screams and holds onto the pole			2
other passengers run to help and demand the man let go of her , which he eventually does			0
' @entity171 ' published the video on her @entity2 channel with the message , ' let this be a lesson learned , ' but it 's unclear exactly what the viewer is supposed to glean from the video - except , perhaps , beware of the subway .			1

a @entity2 video of a woman accusing a man of giving her aids was posted to @entity2 earlier this week
the video features disturbing scenes of physical and verbal violence on a subway
it is apparently a prank posted by ' actress ' @entity32 , whose channel is full of *similarly* upsetting ' jokes '
