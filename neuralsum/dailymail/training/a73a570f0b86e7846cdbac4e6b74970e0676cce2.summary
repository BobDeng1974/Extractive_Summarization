by @entity0 published : 21:02 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 21:03 est , 21 november 2012 it is often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery			0
but in the parrot world , it may be a way of striking up a conversation			0
scientists believe that parakeets found in the @entity12 forests mimic each other to begin ' discussions ' about creating new flocks and who will be boss			1
' discussions ' : scientists believe orange - fronted parakeets mimic fellow birds to initiate ' conversations ' the theory comes from a study of orange - fronted parakeets that live in constantly changing flocks			1
@entity25 researchers showed that the birds , which are green with orange foreheads , are more likely to respond to a call that sounds like their own			2
they also reply more quickly			0
this suggests that mimicry is used to initiate ' conversations ' , the journal @entity34 reports			1
in the wild , these may be negotiations on the joining and merging of flocks			1
males may also use the process to establish the pecking order of the new flock , with the willing mimic perhaps more likely to be sub-ordinate			0
researcher @entity43 said : ' it might mean a negotiation on dominance and who is going to lead the fused flock			0
' mimicry : the orange fronted parakeets are found in the forests of @entity12 dr @entity43 believes that some other species of parrot use mimicry for a similar purpose			1
however , parrot owners should take note			0
the researcher says that as pet birds are usually taught the sounds they mimic , any speech can not be taken as an attempt to initiate conversation with their owner			2
and while orange - fronted parakeets excel at mimicking members of their own species , they are poor at replicating the human voice .			2

researchers studied parakeets that live in constantly changing flocks in @entity12 forests
the birds use mimicry to initiate ' conversations ' on the joining and merging of flocks , they say
