she ’s known for her perfect figure and dazzled viewers with her foxtrot in the tenth series of @entity5			1
but @entity6 has revealed she 's never followed a fad diet and does n’t deliberately cut out any foods entirely			1
in fact , she claims she ‘ not a big one for getting on the scales ’ and ‘ could n’t tell you ’ what she weighs today , she told @entity13			1
instead of bathroom scales , she has a favourite pair of skinny jeans			1
they work as her weight - gauge : if she ca n’t fit into them , she knows she has to hit the gym			1
‘ especially the industry i work in , if you look good and you ’re healthy , you feel good , ’ she said			1
‘ if i gain weight , i feel sluggish			1
you ’re not jumping out of bed , ready to tackle the day			1
’ though she was crowned @entity26 in 1999 , her legs are the main focus of her exercise			1
‘ i try and keep my legs in good shape			1
i like to wear my skinny jeans and pencil skirts , ’ she says			1
and harking back to her earlier days as an @entity48 ladette , she admits she still drinks too much on holiday and ca n’t resist crisps			1
‘ i do n’t have a sweet tooth , i ’m lucky			1
so i do n’t have to worry about cakes and biscuits , ’ she told @entity13			1
‘ i like crisps - i could devour a whole bag of them watching my favourite tv shows			1
’ she says she gained around two stone after having her daughter , and often puts on weight over @entity61 or after a holiday – but finds it easy to cut down afterwards			1

‘ i love jacket potatoes			2
but i have them for lunch so i can burn them off in the afternoon , ’ she says			1
despite being 40 , she says she feels much younger , and is n’t scared by the thought of ageing			1
‘ i always think “ you never feel any older ”			2
the way i behave , it ’s like i ’m in my early 20s			2
' having a daughter keeps me young			2
i ’ve got an excuse to be young and silly			2
’ ‘ i do n’t know how i ’ll feel when i ’m 50 , you ’ll have to ask me then			2
