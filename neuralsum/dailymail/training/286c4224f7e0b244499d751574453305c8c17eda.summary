by @entity0 published : 22:36 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 00:42 est , 25 january 2014 the @entity3 @entity2 said on friday that , while litigation continues , an order of @entity6 nuns need not comply with a part of president @entity10 's healthcare law requiring employers to provide insurance that covers contraception			1
in the latest skirmish over religious objections to providing government - mandated contraception , the four - sentence court order was a partial victory for the @entity20 , a @entity22 - based order of nuns that runs nursing homes , and @entity26 - based @entity25 , which manages healthcare plans for @entity6 groups			1
the unusually worded order by the court did impose a requirement on the groups before they can claim the exemption			1
first , they must send written notification to the @entity36 saying they object to the contraception mandate			1
a group of @entity6 nuns in @entity22 ( not pictured here ) do n't need to provide medical insurance that covers contraception for employers as long as litigation over whether or not they must provide the insurance continues @entity10 's healthcare plan requires employers to provide insurance coverage that includes contraceptive coverage to employees the court 's decision means that , as long as the groups send the letters , they are effectively exempt while litigation continues in lower courts , putting off for now any conclusive decision on this latest legal test of @entity61 , as the president 's @entity62 has become known			1
the @entity64 , which represents the groups , hailed the court 's order as a victory			1
' we are delighted that the @entity2 has issued this order protecting the @entity72 , attorney @entity69 said in a statement			0
' the government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people - it does n't need to force nuns to participate			0
' the @entity80 did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment			0
@entity83 , president of @entity84 , which supports the mandate , said in a statement that the case focused only on the way that groups like the @entity72 can claim an exemption			1
' this is a case about paperwork , not religious liberty , ' she said			2
dozens of other @entity6 groups are involved in similar litigation across the country			2
most have already won temporary injunctions			0
so far , no federal appeals court has ruled on the merits of the groups ' claims , according to the @entity64			2
a @entity84 spokesperson said that the case is about ' paperwork ' and about how groups claim exemption from providing contraceptive coverage the organizations accuse the federal government of forcing them to support contraception and sterilization in violation of their religious beliefs , or face steep fines			1
the @entity118 lawsuit was filed also on behalf of hundreds of other groups that obtain benefits via @entity25 , although that has not been certified as a class - action at this stage			2
the @entity64 say they would also benefit from the court 's order			0
the unsigned @entity2 order said it ' should not be construed as an expression of the court 's views on the merits			0
' the @entity61 law requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women , including contraception and sterilization			1
the act makes an exception for religious institutions such as houses of worship that mainly serve and employ members of their own faith , but not for schools , hospitals and charitable organizations that employ people of all faiths			0
as a compromise , the administration agreed to an accommodation for non-profits affiliated with religious entities that was finalized in july			0
but the @entity72 and other @entity6 groups said the compromise process still violated their religious rights			2
in court filings , the government had conceded it could not enforce the mandate against the @entity72 in any case because of the nature of their health - care plan			2
a federal judge in @entity166 , @entity167 , denied the plaintiffs ' request for an injunction on dec 27			0
the @entity172 - based 10th @entity3 @entity171 followed suit on december 31 , prompting a last - minute plea to the @entity2			0
although justice @entity176 issued a temporary injunction on december 31 , the court then spent more than three weeks weighing how to proceed			0
in separate cases , the @entity2 has already agreed to hear oral arguments in march on whether for - profit corporations can object to the contraception mandate on religious grounds .			1

religious groups can claim exemption from providing contraceptive insurance by sending a written notification to the @entity36 saying they object to the contraception mandate
as long as the groups send the letters , they are effectively exempt while litigation continues in lower courts , putting off for now any conclusive decision on this latest legal test of @entity61 , as the president 's @entity62 has become known
the @entity61 law requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women , including contraception and sterilization
