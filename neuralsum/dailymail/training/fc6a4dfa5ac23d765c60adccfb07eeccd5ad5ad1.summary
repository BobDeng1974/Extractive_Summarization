the key to living longer is having a waist measurement no bigger than half your height , according to research			1
scientists have devised a simple formula which predicts how many years of life someone will lose to obesity			2
and they claim the rule applies regardless of age , gender or ethnicity			0
as long as this is half your height or less , you should live to the average life expectancy – which is currently around 81			0
but for every few inches over , you face losing months or even years of life			0
for example , an average 30 - year - old man who is 5ft 10in tall – or 70 inches – should have a waist size no bigger than 35 inches			1
a 30 - year - old 5ft 4in woman should have a waist size of 32 inches or under			1
but if the man ’s waist size expands to 42 inches – or 60 per cent of his height – it will knock 1.7 years off his life , according to the formula			1
likewise if the woman ’s waist grows to 38.4 inches she will lose 1.4 years			2
this may not sound much but it quickly adds up if someone is severely obese			0
a 30 - year - old man of 5ft 10in with a 56 - inch waist can expect to lose 20.2 years from his life expectancy			1
similarly a woman with a 51 - inch waist will die 10.6 years earlier			2
scientists have devised a simple formula which predicts how many years of life someone will lose to obesity the researchers at @entity59 at @entity16 , @entity60 , came up with the calculation after looking at records of more than 300,000 adults spanning 20 years			1
dr @entity64 told the @entity65 it should be used as a simple health check that anyone can do at home			1
she added that waist circumference is important because it shows the amount of central fat in the body – which is linked to high cholesterol , diabetes and heart disease			0
she also believes the waist - to - height ratio is a far more reliable predictor of ill health and obesity than the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) – which is widely used by doctors			2
‘ people are living in false hope if they rely on their @entity80 figure			0
we have got to measure the right thing , ’ she said			0
this graphic shows how a 30 - year - old 's life expectancy can decrease by a number of years if their waistline circumference is more than half their height the @entity80 compares a person ’s weight to their height , and puts around 60 per cent of @entity95 in the obese or overweight category			1
but dr @entity97 added that if the government were to use waist measurement instead , this would go up to around 69 per cent			0
professor @entity101 , who was also involved in the study to be published by the @entity103 , said : ‘ there is now overwhelming evidence that government policy should place greater emphasis on waist - to - height ratio as a screening tool			2
’ however dr @entity110 , clinical spokesman on nutrition at the @entity112 , said it was unclear whether ‘ worrying people about their weight actually motivates them to make a long - term commitment to lifestyle changes ’ .			0

scientists at @entity16 say waistline should be half your height
new report shows people adding inches on the waists could die early
a 30 - year - old man *standing* at 5ft 10in with a 56in waist could lose 20.2 years
dr @entity64 says simple test should be a new *global* health check
