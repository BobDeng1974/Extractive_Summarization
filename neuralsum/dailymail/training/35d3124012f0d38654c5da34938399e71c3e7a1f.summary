police are hoping to cut out shoplifting in a crime - plagued town - by deploying cardboard officers			1
the flatpack @entity4 will be propped up in shop windows in @entity7 , @entity8 in the hope that passing crooks will mistake them for real people			0
each cut - out will be holding a white board with a tally of how many shoplifters have been caught in the town			1
police are installing a cardboard officer in a co-op store in @entity7 , @entity8 , to deter shoplifters			2
the cutout will be holding a white sign with the number of thieves caught in the area displayed on it but locals are unconvinced the two - dimensional recruits will deter seasoned thieves who repeatedly target the town 's shops			1
cardboard police officers , costing about Â£ 25 each , have been used by a number of forces but opponents have branded them a gimmick			2
some forces claim they have slashed crimes like shoplifting by 50 per cent but in other areas thieves have simply nicked the cut - outs			1
the deployment , beginning in a co-op , is part of a drive against anti-social behaviour in the run - up to @entity48			1
inspector @entity49 said : ' shoplifting has an impact on all of us			2
big retailers factor in the amount they are likely to lose through shoplifting in prices , so every theft adds to your food bill			0
officers said the cutouts are designed to cut down on anti-social behaviour in the lead up to @entity48 ' when you are talking about major supermarket chains you are talking about an enormous amount of money			1
' there is also the fact that shoplifting covers up a lot of other issues such as social deprivation and alcohol and drug use			0
' locals were n't convinced the cardboard coppers would make much difference			0
@entity77 , manager of a nearby food bank , said : ' people who get desperate enough to steal in the first place wo n't be deterred by a cardboard man if they are not deterred by the security guard			0
' but @entity83 , 27 , who runs a @entity85 store which was robbed by a masked robber earlier this year , said : ' i guess i would consider installing one			0
any kind of deterrent is better than nothing			0

officers have installed model in co-op and plan to put more in other stores
initiative is designed to cut down on shoplifting in run - up to @entity48
but *residents* are not *impressed* and say thieves have stolen the cutouts
