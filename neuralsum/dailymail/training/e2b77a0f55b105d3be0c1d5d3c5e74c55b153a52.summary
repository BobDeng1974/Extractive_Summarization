by @entity0 published : 18:18 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 13 june 2013 stabbed to death : @entity3 the two racist thugs convicted of murdering @entity3 were awarded a total of £ 425,000 of legal aid , official figures reveal			1
@entity3 , 37 , and @entity3 , 36 , each received more than £ 200,000 of taxpayers ’ money to fight their murder charges			1
the amount of money claimed by the teenager ’s killers emerged days after the government vowed to crack down on ‘ fat - cat ’ legal aid solicitors and barristers			1
after a six - month freedom of information battle with the authorities , the @entity19 has finally been given details of the amount of legal aid claimed by @entity3 and @entity3 , both jailed for life in january last year after being convicted of @entity0 ’s 1993 murder			1
our initial request in december last year was turned down by the now defunct @entity30 because the pair were appealing their convictions and officials ruled that disclosing the figures could prejudice any potential retrial			0
but @entity3 has since dropped his legal challenge and @entity3 ’s bid to clear his name has been thrown out by the @entity39			2
the figures provided to the @entity19 show drug trafficker @entity3 was awarded £ 199,109 of legal aid in the run - up to and during his murder trial , and a further £ 4,200 for his doomed appeal			1
gangster ’s son @entity3 received £ 222,346 in legal aid to defend the murder charge			1
details of how much public money , if any , he received to fund his appeal have not been finalised			2
their combined legal aid awards come to £ 425,655 and dwarf the £ 320,000 compensation paid to @entity0 ’s parents @entity54 and @entity56 for police bungles that hampered their quest for justice			0
the @entity62 ’s counsel fees for the prosecution and related hearings was £ 287,056			0
@entity3 ’s legal team was headed by @entity66 , while @entity67 led @entity3 ’s defence			2
after a six - week trial , an @entity70 jury ruled in january last year that @entity3 and @entity3 were guilty of murdering @entity0 , 18 , in @entity72 , south - east @entity73 in april 1993			1
the pair , who were among a gang of five racist thugs who stabbed @entity0 to death , were jailed for life			0
the verdicts were a victory for the @entity19 , which since 1997 has campaigned for justice for the @entity3 family			1
after their convictions , @entity3 launched an appeal , claiming that the use of a surveillance video in evidence was prejudicial			2
( pictured left ) @entity3 : £ 203,309 in aid and ( pictured right ) @entity3 : £ 222,346 in aid in the film , shot 20 months after @entity0 ’s murder , @entity3 was secretly filmed telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people			1
his lawyers said the video did not prove he was involved in @entity0 ’s murder and should not have been admitted as evidence			0
the footage also showed @entity3 using violent , racist language			2
he was seen recalling a time he threatened a black colleague with a knife			0
lawyers for @entity3 also objected to the way prosecutors presented scientific evidence in the trial			0
the breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold - case team of forensic scientists were called in			0
they found tiny traces of blood , hair and fibres on clothing seized from the pair ’s homes			0
the defence claimed this was the result of contamination , but that was rejected by the jury			0
this march , just over a month before the 20th anniversary of the murder , @entity3 finally dropped the appeal against his conviction			1
in may , @entity3 lost a second attempt to challenge his conviction when he was refused permission to appeal by the @entity131			0
@entity133 chief sir @entity132 has told the @entity19 he has no plans to close the investigation into @entity0 ’s murder , which puts pressure on the three other members of the gang that killed @entity0 , brothers @entity140 and @entity142 and their friend @entity143 , who have not been convicted			1
hopes of a breakthrough in the long - running murder probe rose in april after police said a 20th anniversary appeal for information had prompted ‘ two very significant ’ phone calls			1
last week , justice secretary @entity151 said the amount paid out in legal aid was ‘ unsustainable ’ , adding that taxpayers could not keep footing the bill for a system said to cost £ 2billion a year			2
a spokesman for the @entity158 , which replaced the @entity30 , said : ‘ anyone on trial for a serious criminal offence can apply for legal aid so a lawyer can represent them in court			0
funding is subject to a means test which could require the defendant to pay towards their legal costs			0

@entity3 , 37 , and @entity3 , 36 , each received more than £ 200,000 of taxpayers ’ money to fight their murder charges
