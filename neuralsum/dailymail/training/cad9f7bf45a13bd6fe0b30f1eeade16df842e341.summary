@entity1 's general election campaign descended into chaos this morning after internal party rows over policy spilled out into the open			1
the party 's health spokesman @entity5 publicly slapped down party leader @entity7 after he suggested the @entity8 may need to be privatised to cope with the growing pressure on the health budget caused by a rapidly - ageing population			1
it came after the @entity13 in charge of writing the party 's 2015 manifesto was replaced – after not coming up with any policies			2
the @entity1 leader said it would be ' curtains ' for him and his colleagues if the country rejected the chance to cut ties with @entity34			2
@entity35 has promised a referendum on @entity24 's membership if the @entity38 form the next government			0
mr @entity7 said : ' the loss of a referendum means curtains for @entity7 and it means curtains for the current crowd here in head office			2
' it comes after mr @entity7 last year vowed to resign as party leader if the party fails to achieve a general election breakthrough			1
he said : ' if we 'd failed in the @entity54 elections i would have stood down , if we fail next year the party will pick someone better than me , but do you know what ? that ai n't going to happen			0
' @entity19 was replaced as the @entity1 policy chief after failing to complete the party 's manifesto in time for may 's crunch general election , senior party figures have confirmed			1
the revelation emerged after mr @entity7 sparked controversy by claiming that privatising large parts of the @entity8 was ' a debate that we 're all going to have to return to ' if the health service was going to stay affordable			1
within hours of the remarks @entity1 's @entity71 , @entity5 , insisted mr @entity7 was out of touch with the public when it came to the @entity8			1
she said : ' @entity7 is entitled to his opinion and others are entitled to theirs , we do n’t whip people into all thinking the same thing , like the establishment parties			0
' as he has said before , he raised the idea for discussion a while ago , the party discussed at and rejected it			0
' i am certain that if the party discuss it again , we will reject it again			0
the vast majority of @entity1 members , the @entity24 public and i will always favour a state funded @entity8			1
' the rows come just over three months before the general election in which @entity1 is hoping to increase the number of @entity95 into double figures			0
but mr @entity7 himself is facing a battle to be elected in @entity99 , where he is currently trailing the conservative candidate @entity100 by up to five points in the polls			2
his election bid was also dealt a blow after stand - up comic @entity105 announced he would stand against mr @entity7 as his tv character ' @entity107 '			1
the revelation that mr @entity19 – one of the party 's bright young hopes – has failed to complete the party 's manifesto in time in a fresh embarrassment for the party which has previously acknowledged that it needs to professionalise its operation			1
@entity7 is facing a battle to be elected in @entity99 , where he is currently trailing the conservative candidate @entity100 by up to five points in the polls according to the @entity120 , @entity1 had set the beginning of january as the deadline to agree its election policies			2
the manifesto would then be sent off to be checked and costed by an independent think - tank			0
senior party figures had become increasingly concerned that mr @entity19 , 29 , was struggling to complete the final draft of the manifesto on time			2
a senior @entity1 insider said : ' there was growing disquiet that none of us had seen hide nor hair on the policy front			2
it was especially annoying for candidates , who are banned from making any specific pledges before the manifesto is published			0
' they do n't know what to tell voters on the doorstep			0
' @entity1 's deputy chairman @entity1 has now been drafted in to finish the manifesto			1
she said : ' @entity19 was responsible for running our policy programme , but as an @entity13 , borough councillor and @entity151 [ prospective parliamentary candidate ] for the target seat of @entity154 he stepped down from the role of policy chief			1
comic @entity105 is standing against @entity7 is @entity99 ' i relish the task of putting together the final details and presenting a sensible , radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in @entity163			2
' a @entity1 spokesman this morning insisted it was untrue that mr @entity19 had been ' sacked '			1
he said : ' it 's bunkum			0
when he was elected as a borough councillor he said he could n't do it any more			0
the handover was over the weekend of the ninth , tenth , eleventh of this month			0
' the manifesto was always supposed to be ready for the conference next month			0
' @entity1 has insisted its manifesto will commit to protecting the @entity8 as a free - to - use taxpayer - funded service			1
but mr @entity7 has insisted that the idea of replacing the @entity8 with an insurance - based system is ' a debate that we 're all going to have to return to '			1
he said : ' there is no question that healthcare provision is going to have to be very much greater ... and we 're going to have to find ways to do it			0
' last year a video emerged from 2012 in which mr @entity7 proposed an ' insurance - based system of healthcare '			1
he had been recorded saying : ' frankly , i would feel more comfortable that my money would return value if i was able to do that through the marketplace of an insurance company than just us trustingly giving £ 100bn a year to central government and expecting them to organise the healthcare service from cradle to grave for us			0
' mr @entity7 said : ' i triggered a debate within @entity1 that was outright rejected by my colleagues , so i have to accept that			1
' as time goes on , this is a debate that we 're all going to have to return to			0
' but in his latest interview mr @entity7 insisted that the way the @entity8 is run will have to change to care for @entity24 's ageing population			1
he said : ' there is no question that healthcare provision is going to have to be very much greater in ten years than it is today , with an ageing population , and we 're going to have to find ways to do it			0
' @entity218 , @entity220 's @entity219 , said mr @entity7 's comments ' confirmed that a vote for @entity1 is a vote for the privatisation of the @entity8 and for a full @entity225 healthcare system '			1
he said : ' @entity7 admits he says one thing in public about the @entity8 but another behind closed doors			2
he has shown @entity1 's statements on protecting the @entity8 to be hollow			1
' @entity1 claim to stand up for working people , but in reality they are more @entity233 than the @entity233			0
@entity7 will never be able to distance himself from his real views			0
he should be honest with the public			0
