by @entity0 a man has gone from struggling to fasten his seatbelt on a plane to looking forward to taking his first flying lessons after losing more than 11st			0
thirty - one - year - old @entity5 has dreamed of fulfilling his ambition to learn to fly for years but was always too heavy for light aircraft			1
now he ’s slimmed from 25st 9lb to 14st 6lb and been named @entity8 2014 – and to celebrate he ’s planning to take to the air			1
@entity5 , who works for insurance firm @entity10 , was nicknamed ‘ @entity14 ’ as a child and has struggled with his weight since school			1
he says : ‘ i turned 30 at the beginning of 2013			0
you get to that age and i suppose you start to grow up a bit			0
i ’d been lucky and did n’t have any health problems , but i began to wonder how long i could continue with the lifestyle i was leading and remain reasonably healthy			0
‘ we organised a number of birthday celebrations throughout the year and looking back i realise my weight impacted on a lot of them			0
a holiday to @entity41 last summer was almost ruined because i spent the whole time feeling too hot to enjoy myself , and on the plane home i only just managed to fasten the seatbelt			0
it dug into me for the whole flight and i decided enough was enough			0
@entity5 used to eat an unhealthy diet of convenience food , snacking on crisps and chocolate back home @entity5 and his wife @entity51 , who live in @entity52 in @entity53 , joined a nearby @entity54 in @entity55 in august 2013			1
@entity5 says : ‘ anyone who says they were n’t nervous when they first joined @entity8 , especially a bloke , probably is n’t telling the truth			1
‘ i was terrified because i thought everyone was going to turn and look at me , but i need n’t have worried as everyone was so friendly and welcoming – and there was even another man there which pleased me no end ! i quickly realised i ’d come to the right place and i ’ve made so many friends there now , it ’s like having your own cheerleading squad every week			0
’ @entity5 's incredible achievement has resulted in him being crowned @entity8 's @entity75 @entity5 and @entity51 swapped their diet of ready meals , convenience foods and weekly takeaways for cooking meals from scratch including their favourite dish of barbecue pulled pork			1
he says : ‘ i ’ve followed meal replacement diets before and lost several stone but they taught me nothing about changing the way i eat and my relationship with food , so when i stopped , the weight went back on as quickly as i ’d lost it			2
‘ i love that i can fill my plate and feel satisfied – the only problem now is that @entity51 and i argue over who gets to do the cooking because we both enjoy it so much ! ’ previously doing minimal activity , @entity5 has discovered a love of running during his weight loss as well as overhauling his eating habits , @entity5 ’s discovered a love of running			1
he says : ‘ i ’ve never been sporty and at school i ’d do anything i could to avoid @entity107			0
but after i ’d lost a bit of weight i decided i wanted to increase my activity levels and my consultant , @entity111 , told me about the couch to 5km challenge , which promised to get you running for 30 minutes within weeks			1
‘ i decided to give it a try and within eight weeks i ran 30 minutes without stopping – in fact , i was so pleased i ended up running for 45 minutes because i did n’t want to stop ! since then i ’ve taken part in 10k races and i ’d like to attempt further in the future			2
breakfast : @entity122 , large latte lunch : pre-packed sandwiches , large bag of crisps and a bag of sweets dinner : frozen pizza with a large portion of chips snacks : sharing bags of crisps or chocolate bars breakfast : fresh fruit with fat - free fromage frais and granola mid-morning : skinny cappuccino lunch : tuna pasta salad mid-afternoon : plenty of fresh fruit dinner : @entity148 pulled pork with chips ( baked in the oven ) and roasted vegetables snacks : sushi , lean meat , fruit , ice lollies since joining @entity158 ’s lost 11st 3lb and dropped from a size @entity159 and a 48in waist to wearing @entity163 clothes and a 34in waist while his wife @entity51 has lost nearly 4st			1
@entity5 , who would like to lose another stone to reach his personal target weight , says : “ it ’s been incredible and doing it together with @entity51 has been really important because whenever one of us has had a bad day the other one is there to pick them up and keep us both on track			1
i feel fantastic and being named as @entity176 2014 is incredible			0
’ this summer when @entity5 heads off on holiday he ’s not worrying about the heat or aeroplane seats and he has big plans for the rest of the year too			2
he says : ‘ we ’re returning to a music festival we went to last year and planning to recreate some of the photos to see the difference in us			0
i ’m also hoping to try scuba diving now i can fit in a wetsuit , and i ’m going to learn to fly which is something i ’d always wanted to do but i was previously too heavy for light aircraft			2
‘ people always say that losing weight has given them a second chance at life but i ’ve never been this slim before so i feel like this is my first chance and i ’m determined to make the most of it			2
i ’m never going back to the old @entity5 , this is me forever now			2

always large , @entity5 's poor diet led his weight to rise to nearly 26st
aged 30 he decided to tackle his size and joined @entity8
*drastically* changed diet and discovered a love of running
lost over 11st to reach 14st 6lb and is now slim enough to learn how to fly
