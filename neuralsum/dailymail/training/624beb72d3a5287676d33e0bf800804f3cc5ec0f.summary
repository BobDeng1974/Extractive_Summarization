@entity0 photoshopped the front cover of the latest issue of her eponymous magazine , which appears to show her lounging alongside an @entity6 lion , despite telling her readers they must learn to be braver in the @entity8			1
according to the @entity10 , @entity0 and her cover co-star @entity9 never actually got the chance to meet due to fears over the 60 - year - old 's safety			1
instead , the 10 - year - old lion was photographed the day before the glamorous tv host and was accompanied by his caretaker , who remained on - set throughout the shoot to ensure his every need was catered for			1
speaking about the cover , @entity0 , who has previously shared the cover of @entity38 , @entity39 , with the likes of @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , joked that it was one of the most bizarre shoots she has ever done			2
' i can honestly say i 've never done this before , ' she joked , while reclining next to mr @entity27			0
and while @entity0 managed to avoid a confrontation with the majestic animal , photographer @entity48 was not so lucky , however he did shoot @entity9 from inside a reinforced protective cage , to ensure his safety throughout the day			2
thus far , @entity0 's decision to photoshop her cover has been met with mixed feelings from readers , some of whom have applauded her ' sensible ' choice to respect the animal 's natural strength and aggression			0
discussing the cover on entertainment forum @entity63 , one @entity0 fan said : ' good for her , ' while another added : ' think it 's better that she did n't actually pose with the lion ! ' the finished product : while the end result looks fantastic , @entity0 has faced criticism from some who believe her @entity75 trickery contradicts the theme of the magazine caged : photographer @entity48 shot @entity9 from inside a reinforced metal structure there are some , however , who feel @entity0 's @entity75 trickery contradicts the overall theme of the january issue , which sees readers urged to ' tame your fears and start living your happiest year yet '			1
' although the theme of the issue is " @entity90 " , @entity0 was n't actually [ brave enough ] when it came to posing for the cover , ' refinery 29 's @entity87 wrote			2
' see , she and @entity9 , her 10 - year - old african lion cover costar , posed separately			1
@entity9 was photographed one day earlier , and his caretaker was on the site to make sure everything went smoothly			0
' @entity98 's @entity98 's @entity97 added : ' because this cover is meant to inspire a " @entity90 " who will conquer 2015 as fearlessly as @entity0 lounges next to a ferocious animal while wearing a sophisticated green velvet gown			0
as these " behind the scenes " photos reveal , @entity0 only posed with a big stuffed animal , not a real lion at all			0
' her bravery was a mere @entity75 manipulation because of " safety concerns " and also because nothing is real and hope is dead			0

the tv star appears to be posing alongside a lion on the cover of her magazine - but it was later revealed the two were shot separately and then photoshopped together for safety reasons
@entity0 asked set designer @entity27 to dress up in a lion costume and pose alongside her during her shoot
in the january *edition* of @entity38 , @entity39 , the 60 - year - old *encourages* readers to embrace a ' brave new you ' in 2015
