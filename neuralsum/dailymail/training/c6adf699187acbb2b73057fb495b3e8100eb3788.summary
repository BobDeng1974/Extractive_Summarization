a 350 - million - year - old scorpion fossil is thought be the oldest known land - living animal in the @entity4 supercontinent , @entity5			1
@entity5 was a giant ancient continent made up of the land masses now known as @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			0
the specimen was discovered in rocks from the @entity15 near @entity16 , @entity17 by dr @entity18 , from the @entity19 at @entity20			1
the fossil discovery , which included this pictured sting of the scorpion , represent the earliest record of a land living animal in @entity5			2
@entity5 was a giant ancient continent made up of the land masses now known as @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 @entity5 was a giant ancient continent made up of the land masses now known as @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			0
the first stage of its breakup began in the early @entity32 , about 180 million years ago			1
the name @entity5 was coined by the @entity35 geologist @entity34 in reference to @entity38 and @entity39 formations in the @entity5 region of central @entity12			0
the fossil has been identified as a new species of scorpion called @entity44			1
dr @entity18 claims that this 350 - million - year - old fossil will allow scientists to confirm some long - held ideas about early life			1
scientist know that @entity51 - the single northern landmass then comprising what is today @entity53 and @entity54 - was inhabited by diverse invertebrates 420 million years ago			2
but this supercontinent was at the time separated from the southerly positioned @entity5 by a deep ocean			0
‘ evidence on the earliest colonisation of land animals has up till now come only from the northern hemisphere continent of @entity51 , and there has been no evidence that @entity5 was inhabited by land living invertebrate animals at that time , ’ explained dr @entity18			2
these pincers of a 350 million - year - old scorpion was discovered in rocks from the @entity15 near @entity16 , @entity17 ‘ for the first time we know for certain that not just scorpions , but whatever they were preying on were already present in the @entity73 [ which occurred around 416 million years ago ] ‘ we now know that by the end the @entity73 period @entity5 also , like @entity51 , had a complex terrestrial ecosystem , comprising invertebrates and plants which had all the elements to sustain terrestrial vertebrate life that emerged around this time or slightly later , ’ he said			1
dr @entity18 explained that early life was initially confined to the sea and the process of moving life to land began during the @entity87 about 420 million years ago			1
the first wave of life to move out from water onto land consisted of plants , which gradually increased in size and complexity throughout the @entity73			0
dr @entity18 ( pictured ) claims that this 350 - million - year - old fossil will allow scientists to confirm some long - held ideas about early life this initial colonisation of land was followed by plant and debris - eating invertebrate animals such as primitive insects and millipedes			1
by the end of the @entity87 period about 416 million years ago , predatory invertebrates such as scorpions and spiders were feeding on the earlier colonists of land			2
in 2007 scientists discovered a 390 million year - old fossilised claw of an ancient sea scorpion that showed these creatures are larger than previously thought			0
the fossils indicated that the scorpion weighed an estimated 400lb and was armed with savage 18 - inch claws			0
at the time of the discovery , dr @entity119 , of the @entity120 at @entity121 , said it proved that ancient spiders , insects and crabs would have been giants			0
‘ we have known for some time that the fossil record yields monster millipedes , scorpions , cockroaches , and dragonflies but we never realised , until now , just how big some of these ancient creepycrawlies were , ’ he said .			0

@entity5 was the more southerly of two supercontinents that existed between approximately *510* to 180 million years ago
the fossil was found near @entity16 , @entity17 by dr @entity18
scientists hope it will confirm some long - held ideas about early life
the fossil has been identified as a new species of scorpion called @entity44
