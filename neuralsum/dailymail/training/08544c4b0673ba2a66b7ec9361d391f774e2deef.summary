a curry - mad couple longed for their favourite @entity3 takeaway so much that they had it delivered almost 500 miles to their new home			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , moved to @entity13 eight months ago but complained that they could n't find a decent takeaway in @entity16			1
so they convinced their mothers to pick up orders of chicken dansak , pilau rice and @entity23 naan from @entity24 in @entity25 before making the six - hour journey through the @entity27			2
@entity9 and @entity10 from @entity28 , @entity11 at @entity29 before they emigrated			1
they love the food so much that they had it shipped 500 miles to their new home in @entity13 , @entity16 the @entity3 takeaway orders are sent either fresh or frozen so they couple can enjoy their meal at their leisure and the @entity3 restaurant 's food is so popular that they have customers requesting for it to be flown over to @entity45 and even as far as @entity46			1
the couple relocated to @entity13 to start their own fishery business and claim it is impossible to get a decent takeaway in @entity16			1
@entity9 , 27 , said : ' it 's a beautiful way of life over here , very relaxed and calm , but you just ca n't get the same food			1
' there are kebab places but it 's not the same thing			0
i do n't think they [ the @entity16 ] have the taste for it			2
the couple 's relatives pick up their orders before making the six - hour journey through the @entity27 mr and mrs @entity69 are trying to convince the owner of their favourite restaurant to open a branch in @entity16 ' we used to live in @entity28 in @entity11 and had our @entity75 leaving party , and joint hen and stag dos in @entity29 restaurant			1
we absolutely love the food			0
' the couple 's strange demands are nothing new for @entity83 , who has been the manager of the restaurant in @entity25 since it opened nearly six years ago			1
he has a customer who took a curry to their sister in @entity90 , @entity16 , and even one who sent someone to pick up an order to take to @entity45 by private jet			2
a businessman in @entity46 has offered @entity83 plane tickets to take their in - demand food abroad			0
@entity99 ( right ) and her sister @entity98 picking up the curry from mr @entity83 mr @entity83 said : ' the guy in @entity46 keeps asking for our recipes and asking if i 'll take some food to him by plane			0
' i 'm originally from @entity107 and my flights home always stopover in @entity46 , so i told him the next time i go out there i 'll bring him something			0
' but i 'm not going there just to deliver a takeaway			0
we do n't even deliver to our @entity25 residents , so it would be really unfair to deliver to someone in @entity46 and not them			0
' on a recent trip , mr @entity10 's mother @entity119 popped in to grab the takeaway order before making the journey to visit the couple			1
the busy duo have n't had time to tuck into the meal yet and are saving it for a quiet evening when they can heat it up and enjoy it together			0
' we keep joking with @entity83 that he should come over and open an @entity3 takeaway in @entity16 , ' mrs @entity69 said			2
' sometimes he sends it over fresh or frozen , depending on what we want			0
' he 'd bend over backwards for anyone			0

@entity9 and @entity10 from @entity11 moved to @entity13 for business
couple claim it 's impossible to get a decent takeaway in @entity16
family *members* bring them meals from @entity29 restaurant in @entity25
