@entity0 has criticised @entity1 for saying ‘ some stupid things ’ after the @entity3 assistant manager questioned the pressure applied by @entity5 on @entity6 and @entity7 over playing for their country			1
@entity6 wanted to play against @entity11 last friday but was left out after @entity5 continued to request updates on his hamstring injury			1
the midfielder has missed the @entity3 ’s last three @entity16 qualifiers and @entity7 sat out last month ’s game in @entity18			1
both played for @entity5 four days later			2
@entity1 is concerned that @entity5 are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty @entity1 , who believes manager @entity23 should hold talks with @entity5 counterpart @entity25 to resolve the issue , said : ‘ you always get the impression from @entity5 that @entity7 and @entity6 are both barely able to walk			1
‘ so when they actually turn up and they are walking through the reception , you think “ @entity34 , it ’s a miracle ”			0
‘ i worry that @entity6 is under lots of pressure , particularly from @entity5 ’s point of view , ’ continued @entity1			1
‘ there has to be some sort of sit - down conversation			0
i do n’t think @entity25 has ever played at senior international level and maybe he does n’t appreciate how big the games are for us			2
’ @entity5 chairman @entity0 countered : ‘ i ’m a big fan of @entity1 but he does say some stupid things			1
@entity0 ( left ) said that @entity5 never stand in the way of their players ' international committments @entity7 ( right ) missed @entity3 's match against @entity18 last month , but was deemed fit for @entity5 ‘ that is just totally , totally unfair			1
we absolutely love our players going on international duty and we never ever get in the way of them and @entity25 will be as shocked as everyone at @entity5			2
’ @entity23 said : ‘ from my own perspective , i think the situation was this : way back the two lads were not fit for the games against @entity62 and @entity18 ( in october ) , and played for @entity5 a couple of days later			2
‘ i had spoken to @entity7 and @entity64 just was n’t right			0
i did n’t speak to @entity6 at the time , but there was a thought that he might have played against @entity68 then , but did n’t do so			0
‘ i had n’t really a problem with that at all , it was just that this particular time , @entity6 does have a muscle injury			0
he came here , he was wanting to try it and really wanted to give it a go			0
‘ we always thought that time would be against us and i think he will be perfectly all right to play at the weekend for his club , and really there is n’t much more i can say about it			0
