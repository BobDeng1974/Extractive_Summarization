@entity0 has left @entity2 ’s base in @entity3 to complete his £ 23million move to @entity5			1
the @entity6 international has said his final farewells to his @entity2 team - mates , including close friend @entity10 , after the @entity12 club offered a deal , with add - ons , which is closer to owner @entity16 ’s valuation			1
@entity0 is expected in the @entity12 capital at lunchtime for a medical and to agree and finalise personal terms			0
he told manager @entity21 after training yesterday that he was keen to move back to @entity6			0
his departure is a blow to @entity21 , whose side face @entity33 and former manager @entity35 tonight , before they take on @entity37 in the @entity38 on saturday lunchtime			1
@entity21 and chief scout @entity40 now have until friday to find a replacement for @entity0 , who has been their outstanding player this season after returning to the side following the closure of the august transfer window			1
they are also hoping to complete a deal to bring in @entity50 striker @entity49			1
@entity51 @entity0 's imminent move to @entity5 for a fee of £ 23million is at odds with a statement made by @entity2 's director of football @entity51 on january 20th			1
@entity51 insisted that the @entity6 international would not be leaving @entity60 after earlier interest from @entity29 and the big spending @entity58 club			2
' i will not let any player leave @entity2 in this transfer window , ' said @entity51 only eight days ago			1
by @entity66 @entity68 ’s midfielder @entity67 remains the favourite to join @entity2 and , despite the opposition of their owner @entity71 , could now be convinced to move to the @entity73			1
the loss of @entity0 will also be felt by @entity2 supporters who had recognised the influence of the @entity6 international in a new role in the side			2
his decision to go on strike on the eve of the new season was misguided to say the least , but he recovered his relationship with supporters who regularly sang his name with the best form of his @entity2 career			0
rumours of @entity5 ’s interest may have surfaced before their game at @entity90 a fortnight ago , but @entity0 scored two at @entity92 in arguably one of his best performances of the season			2
new team - mates ? @entity0 could be providing the ammunition for @entity97 ( left ) and @entity98 @entity16 ’s decision to sell one of his favourite players comes down to business and nearly £ 20million profit for a 28 - year - old is too good to turn down			2
but it is derby week			0
the timing could be better			0
unlike the sale of @entity109 , which led to the signing of @entity112 , @entity2 have time to find a replacement			0
supporters will just be hoping that @entity16 has the will and desire after a quiet summer			0
because he certainly has the money .			0

a fee of £ 23million is agreed between the two clubs
a *delegate* of @entity5 officials were on @entity125 and *initially* offered £ *14m*
but @entity2 face *bitter* *rivals* @entity37 on saturday
@entity0 will be an *enormous* loss to the @entity131 - he has scored five goals in his last seven outings
@entity21 is hoping to complete a deal for @entity136 's @entity49
@entity68 midfielder @entity67 is likely to arrive at @entity60
director of football @entity51 *previously* claimed he would ' not let any player leave @entity2 in this transfer window ' ( january 20th )
