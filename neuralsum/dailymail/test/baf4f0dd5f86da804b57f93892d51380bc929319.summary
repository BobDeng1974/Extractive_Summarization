a @entity1 archaeologist hunting for a royal tomb in a tunnel beneath a towering @entity5 pyramid has made a discovery that may have brought him a step closer : liquid mercury			1
in the bowels of @entity10 , a mysterious ancient city that was once the largest in the @entity12 , earlier this month @entity13 found ' large quantities ' of the silvery metal in a chamber at the end of a sacred tunnel sealed for nearly 1,800 years			1
and because of the potential supernatural significance of liquid mercury in ritual ends , deeper into the complex @entity13 hopes to find the elusive last resting place of a king			1
if @entity13 is right , it could help settle a debate over how power was wielded in @entity10 , a city boasting massive stone pyramids that was home to as many as 200,000 people and the heart of ancient empire that flourished between 100 and 700 a.d. some archaeologists believe the toxic element could herald what would be the first ruler 's tomb ever found in @entity10 , a contemporary of several ancient @entity55 cities , but so shrouded in mystery that its inhabitants still have no name			1
unsure why the mercury was put there , @entity13 says the metal may have been used to symbolize an underworld river or lake			0
though mercury has previously been uncovered in small amounts at a few @entity55 sites much further south , it had never been found in @entity10			2
@entity68 was rare in ancient @entity1 , as it was difficult to mine and prized for its reflective properties			0
archaeologists believe it may have had a supernatural significance for ritual ends			2
@entity10 , or ' abode of the gods ' in the @entity79 language of @entity80 , was distinct from the @entity82 civilization			1
royalty : @entity13 said that he is unsure as to why the mercury was in the tunnel ( pictured ) , but he hopes that it will lead him to the tomb of the city 's king digging : @entity91 ( @entity91 ) archaeologists work at a tunnel that may lead to a royal tombs discovered at the ancient city of @entity10 in 2011			1
@entity13 said their findings could lead to settling the debate as to how power was distributed in the city its inhabitants left behind no written record , abandoning the city long before the @entity79 came to power in the 14th century			2
@entity104 dug at @entity10 in the 1670s , but rigorous scientific excavation of the site did not begin until the 1950s			0
@entity13 's six - year slog in the tunnel has already yielded tens of thousands of artifacts including stone sculptures , fine jewelry and giant seashells leading to the three chambers			0
the painstaking excavation has slowed due to extreme humidity , mud , and now , the need for protective gear to avoid mercury poisoning			0
@entity121 , a @entity122 archaeologist who has spent more than four decades excavating @entity10 , says the mercury find increases the odds of finding a tomb			2
' but it 's still very uncertain , and that is what keeps everybody in suspense , ' he added			0
@entity1 archaeologist @entity131 believes that at its peak , the city was ruled not by a single king , but a council of four lords , and that @entity13 may find the remains of one of them			1
to bolster her argument , she cites the absence of a single palace or the presence of kings in any of the city 's many murals			0
the excavation of the chambers should be finished by october , @entity13 said , with an announcement of findings by the end of 2015 .			0
