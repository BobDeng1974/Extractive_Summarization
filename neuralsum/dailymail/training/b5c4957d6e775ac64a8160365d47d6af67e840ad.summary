by @entity0 perhaps it ’s the six pigtails streaming in the wind			2
or the two mad pompoms bobbing about on his muscular hind quarters as he prances through the waves on @entity9 beach			2
or perhaps it ’s the four - hour bespoke luxury ‘ wash and set ’ that comes after			1
whichever , it ’s safe to say that @entity14 , aka @entity15 the standard poodle , is not a dog that should ever be described as ‘ standard ’			1
@entity19 's @entity0 meets two year old poodle ' @entity15 ' the @entity22 winner at @entity23 owner @entity24 leads ' @entity15 ' at play on @entity26			1
a day at the beach is all fun and good , but afterwards comes the intense procedure of cleaning the dog he spends his life whizzing from dog show to dog show in a smart red @entity35 van , loves @entity36 , adores watching himself on telly , enjoys a daily romp on the beach ‘ to help him glow ’ , and this month was crowned @entity41 at @entity23 — beating nearly 22,000 dogs from 45 countries to win immeasurable glory , a vast two - tone green rosette and a cheque for £ 100			1
this week , he has graciously invited me to his home at the @entity49 , near @entity9 , to share in the minutiae of his doggy day			2
the majority of which , it soon becomes evident , is taken up by an ablution regime that would put @entity57 divas to shame			2
dogs like @entity15 need a bit more than a quick sponge and a pat dry			2
dogs like @entity15 need a bit more than a sponge off and a quick dry , instead the procedure of getting him ready for crufts is one that takes hours of prep beforehand after a good hose off @entity15 is taken over to a special table where his owner can carry on the next part of the primping procedure ' @entity15 ' gets dry after his bath , with help from his owner @entity24 ' @entity15 ' gets a blow dry , his hair is far too thick and curly to drip dry or simply use a towell the blow - dry process takes around three hours , and if it is not done thoroughly , the dog 's hair will have nasty knots and tangles happily , he has dedicated staff on hand in the form of owners @entity24 , 35 , and @entity93 , 52 , who tend to @entity15 in a specially adapted doggy beauty parlour			1
‘ our lives revolve around our dogs and keeping them happy , ’ says @entity24			1
‘ it ’s a labour of love			2
first , @entity103 ’s 12 matching lilac hairbands are gently teased from his long , bluey - black mane , where they ’ve been lending him more than a passing resemblance to @entity107 , the extravagantly coiffured @entity108 rapper			1
next , his muzzle is given a good scratch and sweet nothings muttered in his ears			2
then , once @entity24 has treble - checked the temperature of his personal doggy @entity114 shower unit , @entity103 is gently hoisted into his special plastic bathtub			1
such is the lustrous thickness and amazing water resistance of his coat , it takes a good few minutes just to wet it through			2
' @entity15 ' falls asleep whilst owner his owner drys and combs his hair , to make sure it has no tangles soon , @entity103 's hairstyle begins to take shape as he is combed again and again @entity103 , a prize winner , stands out amongst his breed , even with six other brothers and sisters of the same breed next , it ’s a good lather in @entity136 shampoo — a sweet - smelling @entity138 preparation — a rinse , a dab more shampoo , another rinse , and then a deep massage with @entity136 conditioner			1
@entity15 is used to being pampered			2
he has a special diet of @entity147 brand dog food , chicken mince , tripe , chicken wings , steak and the odd illicit banana			0
when on the road at dog shows , which is about 30 weekends a year , he often secures his own hotel double bed			0
he is also used to winning			0
as well as triumphing at pretty much every show he ’s entered in the @entity159 , his trophy haul includes @entity160 of @entity108 , and the $ 10,000 ( £ 6,000 ) first prize in the @entity162 of dog shows , the @entity108 @entity164 — the first time a @entity159 dog had ever won			0
his father @entity169 was a best - in - show winner , his grandfather @entity166 ( known as @entity167 , after @entity168 ) was a @entity108 and @entity159 champion			1
@entity24 with @entity15 , as they celebrate winning the @entity41 category @entity15 and the tropy he and his owner have won for the best in show award in the beauty parlour , things are moving slowly			1
after half an hour of lathering , massaging , rinsing and more lathering , @entity24 swaddles him in a cornflower - blue towel			1
‘ i ’m afraid we ’ve only just started , ’ he tells me			0
‘ now it ’s the blow dry			0
you might want to go and get some lunch or something			0
it ’ll take about another three hours			1
’ three hours ! for a dog			2
‘ if i do n’t get him completely dry , we ’ll have a nightmare next time			0
it ’ll be all knotty and nasty			0
so i start with the power blaster			0
’ this looks a bit like a handheld hoover and blasts out the excess water with hot air as @entity103 reclines elegantly on a high table , pink tongue flopping out like a rasher of bacon , occasionally shivering with delight			1
even romping about as a ball of black fur with his six brothers and sisters , @entity103 stood out			1
‘ the best puppy is the one that catches your eye — the one that ’s posing and arching and making you look at him , ’ says @entity93			0
he ’s a confident dog			0
he loves himself , and he always has			0
’ but a real champion also needs something called ‘ good confirmation ’ , he explains			2
‘ they need the basics of a well - constructed , healthy animal			0
‘ and then they need the particulars of the breed			0
for poodles , it ’s all about the quality of the coat			0
’ and the poodle ‘ trim ’ , of course — an extraordinary canine topiary created with scissors , clippers and skill			2
there are four versions : the all - over puppy cut , the @entity239 or @entity240 , the @entity242 saddle ( very complicated , with pompoms down the hind legs ) and the @entity245 — @entity103 ’s ‘ do ’			1
the @entity245 , with its closely clipped feet , face and hindquarters , looks a teeny bit chilly around the important bits , but apparently a dog ’s body temperature is four degrees higher than ours , so they really do n’t mind			0
@entity93 is in charge of clipping and scissoring			0
‘ i taught myself , and i had some unbelievable disasters to begin with			0
but it ’s always going to grow back , is n’t it ? ’ so if he accidentally lopped off one of @entity103 ’s bobbing pompoms , how long would that take ? @entity24 pales behind the dryer			1
’ @entity19 writer @entity0 meets two year old poodle ' @entity15 ' the @entity22 winner at @entity23 within the dog show world , poodle people have a unique camaraderie			1
they compare hair products , send each other power blasters in the post , empathise with the onerous grooming requirements and travel thousands of miles not just to show their charges but to allow their champions to breed			0
‘ you have to have the kind of temperament that finds all this enjoyable , ’ says @entity24 over the roar			1
another hour on and he ’s swapped the blaster for an upright hair dryer on a stand that leaves his hands free to groom			2
‘ for me , it ’s very relaxing — it ’s very far from being a chore			0
’ @entity24 and @entity93 , who met at a dog show in @entity108 , are both utterly delightful , but they must make a daunting pair on the circuit			1
their office is brimming with vast glass trophies , rosettes and photos of award - winning poodles			0
this month , @entity295 became the first kennels ever to breed two @entity23 ’ winners			1
as well as @entity103 ’s triumphs in utility dog and best in show , an @entity108 cocker spaniel called @entity302 , bred by @entity24 and @entity93 , won the gun dog category			1
‘ i thought i was going to explode with bloody pride , ’ says @entity93			0
back on the table , the grooming goes on			0
to be fair , while not every dog would enjoy a four - hour shampoo and set , @entity103 does n’t look remotely put upon			1
in fact , he looks close to heaven			0
during what ( i pray ) is the final styling session , where @entity316 on a leave - in conditioner , @entity103 actually falls asleep , legs flopped open , paws jiggling in some exciting doggy dream or other			1
when it is eventually over , @entity24 gently teases him awake , lifts him down and adjusts his extraordinary coat one last time			1
‘ you always think you can make it look better — but look at that volume ! ’ we all watch in awe as @entity103 bounces about , strutting , preening , pirouetting and ready to undo four hours of coiffing with another run on the beach			1
fit , lithe and happy			0
who just happens to resemble a giant pompom on sticks .			0

@entity103 the poodle is a champion winner at @entity23
he goes through a four hour process of primping to get ready
three hours of this are spent drying and combing @entity103 's fur
owner @entity24 performs most of the cleaning and prep
