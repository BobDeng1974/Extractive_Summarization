by @entity0 @entity1 is mad about sex			1
‘ he ’s got it on the brain , ’ confides his mum , @entity3			1
‘ i do n’t imagine he thinks about much else			2
’ now , hormonal males are n’t always the easiest of charges			0
yet @entity3 seems thrilled about @entity1 ’s voracious sexual appetite			1
for a fascination about the birds and bees is something of a prerequisite in his line of work			0
@entity1 is @entity21 ’s top stud dog , and has been crowned so for two years running			1
an airedale terrier and show dog with a host of trophies to his name , his puppies cost up to £ 1,000 each — which is why airedale females ( or more pertinently , their owners ) are queuing up to meet him			1
@entity1 ’s rough golden - brown fur , long , majestic features and wise brown eyes make him look more like a cuddly teddy than a sex machine , but he ’s been breeding for six years — and has more than 100 puppies across the globe to prove it			1
as @entity41 puts it : ‘ @entity1 does n’t travel			1
he does n’t need to			0
’ the top stud dog in @entity21 : @entity1 's rough golden - brown fur , long , majestic features and wise brown eyes make him look more like a cuddly teddy than a sex machine , but he 's been breeding for six years the bitches ’ owners happily shell out £ 800 - a - time for the privilege			1
but who can blame them ? the puppies are impossibly cute , with those same soulful eyes and fluffy fur , as @entity3 demonstrates , leafing through a photo album			1
when @entity1 is n’t ‘ performing ’ , he spends his time in languid comfort , being groomed , fed and walked at @entity3 ’s three - acre farm in @entity59			1
some walks are conducted on the marvellously named ‘ @entity62 ’ treadmill			0
‘ we do n’t use it very often , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ but if it ’s tipping it down outside , it ’s sometimes easier			0
’ @entity3 , a genial 78 - year - old , has dedicated much of her life to raising @entity68 and is one of @entity21 ’s best - known breeders			1
she currently presides over ten — including @entity1 — housed in pristine kennels behind her family home			1
much of the rest of her land is given over to long grassy runs , enclosed by wooden fences , in which the excitable terriers can let off steam			0
orphaned by the age of five ( her father died in an electrical accident , her mother of ovarian cancer ) , @entity3 was raised by a family friend in @entity85 , where she went to sleep every night under a framed picture of a wire - fox terrier			1
‘ i do n’t know why it was there but i just fell in love with it , ’ she recalls			0
so much so that her first job after leaving school was as a kennel maid			0
three years later she began working for a professional dog handler , who introduced her to her first @entity97			2
‘ he was called @entity99 and that was it really , ’ recalls @entity3			1
’ a dog 's life : @entity1 lives with his owner @entity3 on her three - acre @entity59 farm by the early @entity106 , @entity3 was married to husband @entity107 , now 84 and a former buildings manager			1
they have a son , @entity110 , 51 , who is a partner in the kennels			0
@entity3 says : ‘ i like the @entity112 ’ looks and temperament			1
they are enormously loving but independent			0
if you want a boring dog , do n’t get an @entity97			2
if you do n’t , prepare for them to get into your heart			0
’ of course , @entity1 is the most special of all — he was crowned top stud dog by @entity123 , which is the go - to source for breeders			1
even at the relatively advanced age of eight , he continues to win awards			0
he was named best veteran at this year ’s @entity129 , where he competed under his competition name ‘ @entity131 ’			0
however , these awards are hard work			0
i arrive to find @entity1 on the grooming table , submitting to his daily ablutions — a complex affair involving coat - conditioning spray , deodorising spray and an array of clippers , scissors and brushes			1
‘ he likes all the fuss , although sometimes he gets a little bored , ’ @entity3 confides			1
she keeps him in place via a collar connected to the ceiling by a chain — necessary , @entity3 says , for when he tries to wriggle off the table			1
@entity1 is descended from a line of champions going back decades , including the wonderfully named @entity152 — @entity129 ’ top dog in all breeds in 1983			1
@entity1 ’s father was an @entity157 showdog called captain @entity158 — known as @entity160			1
‘ he had a lot of charisma , ’ says @entity3			2
‘ and @entity1 ’s got that from him			2
but @entity1 ’s also a gentle sort , very patient			2
he ’s not cocky but has a good opinion of himself			0
‘ he knows he ’s special			0
he likes to be first out and first back in when we let the dogs out			0
if you leave another dog ’s kennel open , he ’ll nip in and quickly steal something			2
he has a kind of swagger while being very loving			0
it ’s a nice combination			0
’ for all his lineage , @entity3 acknowledges that you can never know if a dog is stud material until it starts producing litters at around the age of two			1
‘ the proof is in the pudding , ’ she says			0
@entity1 ’s litters are not only of good quality but prolific — the average @entity97 litter is eight , while his is 12			2
competitive world : @entity1 has excelled at shows like @entity129 ( pictured ) which attract the very best of canines however , he wo n’t hook up with just anyone			2
prospective mates must have what @entity3 terms ‘ the right credentials ’ , which mostly come down to a substantial pedigree , clean bill of health and nice demeanour			2
good hips are vital too , as @entity198 are prone to dodgy ones			0
so the bitches are x-rayed and the results sent the @entity202 for analysis			0
those who pass muster include dogs who ’ve travelled from @entity208 and @entity209			0
@entity3 has twice sent @entity1 ’s sperm through the post , although she ’s less keen on this arrangement			1
‘ it ’s quite a lot of fuss and expensive , as you have to have it extracted at the vet and then sort out carriage , ’ she explains			0
‘ obviously , the other people are paying , and i do n’t rule it out if the circumstances demand it			0
’ it ’s not as if the mating ritual itself is romantic : @entity1 and his lady friend are placed in his grooming room ( ‘ we move the tables back to give them a bit of space ’ ) and left to get on with it , albeit under @entity3 ’s supervising gaze in case they ‘ tie ’ — in other words , get stuck and need detangling			1
adorable : one of @entity1 's £ 1,000 puppies @entity1 has never refused a bitch , although the ladies sometimes need a little more encouragement			1
the whole thing takes about 20 minutes , then @entity1 trots back into his kennel			2
@entity3 says : ‘ you could probably go on the internet and find someone offering breeding for £ 400 , but you pay for quality do n’t you ? i ’m an assured breeder — we do it properly — and you know the bloodline			1
’ then there ’s the immense hard work that goes into a rearing a litter			0
‘ if you want to do it properly , it ’s really tough work just to get them to eight weeks , which is the time you would give them away			0
’ and there are the shows to gain those all - important certificates , which take up many days a year and cost thousands of pounds			2
it all sounds rather gruelling , certainly for someone not far off her 80s			0
but @entity3 is at her kennels at 7.30am each day until well after 5pm for non-stop round of grooming , trimming , feeding and walking			2
at 9pm , the dogs have to be let out again for a final run around the paddock			0
what does her long - suffering husband make of it all ? although he is relatively detached from the day - to - day business of looking after the dogs , he knows his place in the pecking order , confiding that @entity3 would ‘ sooner be rid of me than the dogs ’			1
but @entity3 accepts the need for compromise : she wants a couple of dogs in the house but @entity107 ’s put his foot down			2
‘ given i spend all day in the kennels , he wants to have a bit of me to himself , ’ she says			0
among her ten - strong crew are four of @entity1 ’s offspring : @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity298 — all award - winners			1
@entity298 is an adorable seven - month - old bundle of energy , named after @entity302 because of the blonde tufts he sported on his face at birth			2
under his competition name of @entity131 @entity307 , he garlanded best puppy at the @entity309 this year			0
@entity3 has high hopes for him as heir to his father ’s stud - dog title			1
but that ’s not to say there is n’t life in the old dog yet			2
@entity1 ’s show career may be winding down , but @entity3 believes he has a couple more years left as a stud — @entity198 can still be fertile at 11			1
she even had his sperm tested earlier this year			0
‘ it was very good and very strong , ’ she boasts			0
‘ good food , good exercise and lots of @entity328 , that ’s the secret ’ , she says , ruffling an appreciative @entity1 ’s head .			2

@entity1 is an airedale terrier show dog with a host of trophies
he lives in languid comfort on owner @entity3 's three - acre farm in @entity59
@entity1 's puppies cost up to £ 1,000 each - making him a hit with the ladies
