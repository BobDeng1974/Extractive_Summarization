a police force has backtracked and named a retired police officer charged with a £ 113,000 theft after coming under fire for refusing to do so on policy grounds			1
@entity5 performed a u-turn less than 24 hours after claiming their rules had changed in the wake of the @entity10 inquiry , and revealed @entity11 , 54 , was the subject of the allegations			1
a short footnote at the bottom of the press release revealing the charging decision said : ‘ due to a change in policy we no longer release the name of an individual on charge			0
’ u-turn : @entity5 initially refused to name @entity11 , 54 , from @entity25 , after he was charged with a £ 113k theft from the force 's former headquarters but the force were today slapped down by the @entity30 and their own deputy commissioner			1
@entity11 was named by the @entity32 and police were forced into a humiliating backtrack			1
it is a long - standing convention for police to name those they charge with an offence			0
until recently , they would also routinely name anyone they had arrested if asked			0
but following the @entity10 report into press standards , forces have begun rolling back the public ’s right to know who is being arrested			0
chief constable @entity47 , who leads for @entity30 on media issues , said today that suspects should be named once charged			1
' we advise forces , working with the @entity32 , to name those who have been charged and that position will not change , ' he said			0
' when an individual has been arrested our current guidance is not to name them and we will only release the name for the prevention or detection of crime , or if there is a serious public interest			0
' @entity10 's report called for a ban on the press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested to the horror of free speech campaigners , senior officers have drawn up plans which would ban the @entity65 and public being told the identity of anyone arrested			1
@entity10 ’s report called for a ban on the press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested			1
however , the refusal to name a suspect who has been charged and may already be in police custody goes a significant step further in wrapping the judicial system in a cloak of secrecy			2
the naming of suspects who have been charged with criminal offences – and who will stand trial in court – is widely seen as an essential bulwark against arbitrary arrest and detention			2
' we advise forces , working with the @entity32 , to name those who have been charged and that position will not change ' - @entity30 statement after @entity5 refused to name the suspect @entity103 , @entity5 's deputy police and crime commissioner , said that it was in the public interest for the suspect to be named			1
' @entity5 has a reputation for being an open and transparent organisation and i am extremely disappointed at what has transpired in the last 24 hours , ' he said			2
' i was very surprised to hear about this sudden change of policy yesterday evening , and immediately contacted deputy chief constable @entity114 on behalf of the commissioner to discuss our concerns			2
we have since had a number of robust conversations			0
' both the commissioner and i firmly believe that it is in the public interest that this individual is named			0
he is charged with a serious offence			0
' the commissioner is demanding a full and frank report on all of the circumstances that led to this decision , and we will be seeking assurances that in future all national guidelines are adhered to			0
' we are committed to ensuring that @entity5 operate in an open and transparent manner , and that lessons have been learned from the mistakes of the last 24 hours			2
' last night the @entity5 force ’s acting deputy chief constable @entity114 defended their policy			1
but today the force issued a statement admitting that they were wrong and named @entity11			1
' as a result of concerns raised after publication of a press release regarding a man charged with theft , we accept that our decision not to name him was wrong and inconsistent with the current national guidance , ' it read			2
' we will now be adopting the national @entity30 guidance in respect to naming individuals on charge			0
we apologise that our previous approach has not been consistent with this			0
' @entity11 , a 54 - year - old retired police officer , has been charged with the theft of £ 113,000 from the former @entity158 at @entity159			1

@entity5 refused to name former officer charged with theft
@entity164 said it will no longer name suspects once charged ' @entity166 '
@entity11 , 54 , from @entity25 , is finally identified today
police are slapped down by @entity30 and their own deputy crime commissioner
