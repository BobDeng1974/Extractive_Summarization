by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 08:00 est , 8 august 2013 historic : the @entity2 passed into history after it was crossed by the army of @entity5 , pictured the @entity2 has been one of the world 's most famous rivers ever since @entity5 crossed it with his army in 49 @entity10 and triggered a roman civil war			1
but despite its prominent place in history , no one is actually sure where the river is , with three waterways each suggested as a possible candidate for the ancient @entity2			1
now the long - running historical battle is due to be settled for good , as three local historians present their cases at a mock trial in front of a judge			1
it is not disputed that the river runs from the @entity28 mountains down to the @entity29 in the @entity30 in north - east @entity31			1
' crossing the @entity2 ' has been a metaphor for an important and irreversible decision ever since @entity5 took his army over the river from @entity35 , starting a war against @entity37 which would leave him victorious and pave the way for the @entity39			1
in recent years the phrase has been used by figures as diverse as @entity42 , who deployed it last year to warn of the dangers of press regulation , and @entity46 , who sang it in the @entity49 ' 2005 single @entity48			0
however , the river itself lost its political importance in the reign of @entity54 , who abolished its status as @entity31 's northern frontier , and for centuries it faded into relative obscurity			2
due to frequent flooding of the plains around the @entity2 , the river frequently changed its course and it became unclear which of three waterways it was			2
is this it ? this bridge over the @entity67 is believed by some to have been the crossing used by @entity5 the moment : an artist 's impression of @entity5 leading his army across the river on the march to @entity74 @entity76 historians considered the claims of the @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 rivers , and an ancient map called the @entity83 convinced many that the @entity80 was the true @entity2			1
in 1933 , fascist dictator @entity85 , who was intent on harnessing the country 's @entity87 legacy to bolster his own power , made this judgment official , issuing a decree which changed the name of the @entity80 to the @entity2			2
but on saturday the debate start up again in the town of @entity95 as three historians each press the case for their own local river , according to the @entity100			0
journalist and former mp @entity101 will insist that the question has already been answered , and that historians have long regarded the @entity80 as the right answer			2
' this history is often overlooked due to the fact that the person who gave this order was @entity85 , ' he wrote in a preview for the event			0
mystery : there are three main candidates for the location of the historical @entity2 proverbial : the phrase ' crossing the @entity2 ' has been used by the likes of @entity46 and @entity42 however , teacher @entity119 will claim that the @entity79 is the real @entity2 , pointing out that evidence from official maps and the works of the author @entity123 point towards it			1
' there was no definitive proof , ' he said			0
' the debate , which had been going on for centuries , was still open			0
' in reality , @entity85 had political reasons for doing what he did			0
' the case for the @entity81 will be presented by archaeologist @entity134 , who plans to rely on the presence of @entity87 ruins in the area as proof			0
the debate will be judge by @entity141 , president of the local business association , who insists that the fiery arguments are all good - natured and have never undermined relations between neighbours .			0

three rivers in north - east @entity31 each claim to be the historical @entity2
historians will battle it out in mock trial this *weekend* to settle the question
@entity5 crossed the @entity2 with his army in 49 *bc* leading to war
