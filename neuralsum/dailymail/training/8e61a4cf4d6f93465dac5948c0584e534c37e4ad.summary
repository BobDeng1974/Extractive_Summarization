by @entity0 and @entity1 the teen stowaway who survived a five - hour flight from @entity5 to @entity6 after hiding in the wheel well of a @entity8 767 was on airport grounds for six hours before the plane took off , it has emerged			1
the 15 - year - old boy , who has not been named , climbed over the fence at the airport in @entity15 just after 1am on sunday and the @entity16 took off at 7.55am , a federal official told @entity17			1
it is not known when he climbed into the plane 's wheel well , but the aircraft was at the airport at 1am			2
he was found that afternoon on the tarmac in @entity24 , having miraculously survived the flight			1
the teen may have been trying to get to @entity27 to see his mother , @entity29 reported			0
he was living with his father , stepmother and her children in @entity33			0
he has told authorities he does n't want to go home after he was found on the tarmac in @entity24 on sunday , he told the @entity40 he had run away after arguing with his family - but on monday , his sister denied this outside their home			1
and neighbors agreed that version of events did not fit the quiet family who moved into the rental home on the tree - lined suburban street in @entity33 six months ago			1
' they are very quiet , very private , ' @entity52 told @entity53			2
' when i heard there was an argument , that was surprising , because i never hear anything , like loud noises from the house			0
' @entity61 added that the boy 's father drives a taxi , while the stepmother is mostly seen taking her five children to and from school			2
the family did not answer the door to reporters , but a woman who claimed she is the older sister of the boy told @entity74 that he did not have an argument with his family			2
she added that her brother was physically ' ok ' after the trip , but declined to say more			0
the 15 - year - old boy scaled a perimeter fence at @entity79 on sunday and climbed into the wheel well of a plane with no knowledge of where the plane was heading			1
shock that it was the ' quiet ' @entity86 : the teenage boy who survived a flight in the wheel well of a plane lives at this home in @entity33 , @entity5			1
@entity91 has been told he was n't reported missing once by his family despite going missing for 36 hours disbelief : neighbor @entity52 , pictured , said she has never heard the family make a sound the @entity40 has determined that the boy did not have any plans to threaten civil aviation , but authorities are questioning how the teenager breached multiple layers of security			1
' this was not something he planned out , ' @entity40 special agent @entity101 said			0
' my impression is that he ran for the first flight he saw ... his intention was to run away from home			2
' @entity101 said the teen climbed into the left rear wheel well of the first plane he saw in @entity15			1
' he got very lucky that he got to go to @entity24 but he was not targeting @entity24 as a destination , ' he said			1
he passed out in the air and did n't regain consciousness until an hour after the plane landed in @entity6 , @entity101 said			1
when he came to , he climbed out of the wheel well and was immediately seen by airport personnel who escorted him inside where he was interviewed by the @entity40 , @entity101 said			0
it was not immediately clear how the boy stayed alive in the unpressurized space , where temperatures at cruising altitude can fall well below zero and the air is too thin for humans to stay conscious			1
an @entity126 study of stowaways found that some survive by going into a hibernation - like state			2
@entity130 journey : the above graphic shows a @entity8 767 and a map of the route taken by the teenage stowaway on monday , authorities tried to determine how the boy slipped through multiple layers of security , including wide - ranging video surveillance , @entity141 shepherds and @entity143 - riding police officers			1
@entity79 spokeswoman @entity144 says airport employees monitor security video feeds from throughout the 1,050 - acre airport around the clock			2
however , she said no one noticed images of an unidentified person walking on the airport ramp and approaching @entity16 45 in the dark until security agents reviewed the footage after the plane had landed in @entity6 and the boy had been found			1
the airport , in the heart of @entity159 , is surrounded by fences , although some sections do not have barbed wire and could easily be scaled			0
the boy found his way onto the tarmac during the night , ' under the cover of darkness , ' @entity144 said			2
hours later , surveillance video at @entity170 showed the boy getting out of the wheel well after landing , according to a statement from @entity6 's @entity174			1
the video was not released because of the ongoing investigation			0
miracle at @entity170 : the 15 - year - old boy managed to survive for almost 6 hours in freezing temperatures at 38,000 feet during his stolen flight security questions : a 15 - year - old boy scrambled over a fence at the airport , crossed a tarmac and climbed into a jetliner 's wheel well , then flew for five freezing hours , arriving in @entity6 before anyone noticed a picture of the teen being taken away for medical care , looking awake and alert , was provided to the @entity91 by @entity193			1
a congressman who serves on the @entity195 wondered how the teen could have sneaked onto the airfield unnoticed			0
' i have long been concerned about security at our airport perimeters			0
stowaway teen demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed , ' tweeted rep. @entity204 , a @entity205 who represents the @entity207 's eastern cities and suburbs			0
the @entity126 says 105 stowaways have sneaked aboard 94 flights worldwide since 1947 , and about one out of four survived			0
but agency studies say the actual numbers are probably higher , as some survivors may have escaped unnoticed , and bodies could fall into the ocean undetected			0
the @entity126 found that all wheel - well stowaways will lose consciousness at high altitude from lack of oxygen , and that their freezing bodies go into a state somewhat similar to hibernation			1
at 38,000 feet - the cruising altitude of the @entity16 flight - the outside air temperature is about minus 85 degrees			2
that would usually be deadly , but some people survive because their breathing , heart rate and brain activity slow down			0
plane : this is a 767 - 300 aircraft - the same model that the teen boy managed to stow himself away in staggering : the boy somehow survived unharmed while stowed in the wheel well beneath the plane the boy was not charged with any crime and has been handed over to child protective services			1
@entity101 said the boy was medically screened and found to be unharmed			2
but news of the survival was met with suspicion , as most wheel - well stowaways do n't survive the freezing temperatures and lack of oxygen			1
among the skeptics was @entity250 aviation consultant @entity249 , who said : ' this is a first in medical science and a first in physiology			0
i just do n't believe it			0
' dr. @entity257 , @entity250 ' chief health and medical editor , said to survive such conditions , the body has to fall into a hibernation - like state , with the heart only beating a couple of times a minute			0
' it 's near impossible , almost miraculous , and maybe there 's more to the story , ' @entity257 said			0
@entity16 24 to @entity268 , @entity5 , was delayed nearly three hours sunday due to the incident			0
the flight was scheduled to leave @entity170 at noon and finally departed at 2:51 p.m. take - off : the teenager sneaked onto the plane at @entity15 airport in @entity5 ( pictured ) a male passenger who declined to be identified said that he was seated on the plane to @entity268 with his family before he was notified of the delay			1
he said that flight attendants were told to disarm the doors and that the flight would be delayed 10 to 15 minutes			0
a @entity282 spokesman who declined to be named referred questions to the @entity40 and airport authorities			0
in august , a 13 - or 14 - year - old boy in @entity286 survived a 35 - minute trip in the wheel well of a domestic flight after stowing away			1
authorities credited the flight 's short duration and altitude of about 25,000			2
others stowing away in wheel wells have died , including a 16 - year - old killed after stowing away aboard a flight from @entity298 , @entity299 , to @entity300 in 2010 and a 26 - year - old man who fell onto a suburban @entity303 street from a flight from @entity305 in 2012			1
september 2012 : a 26 - year - old @entity307 national flying from @entity305 to @entity308 in @entity303 was found dead in a suburban street under the flight path after presumably falling to his death as the undercarriage opened			1
august 2012 : another man was found dead in the landing gear bay of a boring 747 when it landed at @entity308 from a flight from @entity318 , @entity27			2
june 2010 : a 20 - year - old @entity320 man survived -41f temperatures for 100 minutes during a flight from @entity323 to @entity308			1
he survived because the plane stayed at 25,000 feet due to thunderstorms			0
2006 : @entity326 flew from @entity327 to @entity328 and his core body temperature was 79 degrees fahrenheit when he arrived at the @entity330 for treatment of hypothermia and dehydration			0
anything below 85 degrees @entity335 is usually fatal			0
december 2002 : @entity337 refugee @entity336 flew four hours from @entity338 to @entity339 in a @entity340 in temperatures below -41f			2
he survived due to a leaky pipe which shot out warm air and also gave him something to hold onto when the plane landed .			0

teenage boy flew from @entity15 to @entity24 , @entity6 stowed in a wheel well on sunday and was found ' dazed and *confused* ' on the runway
he braved temperatures of @entity355 ( -62c ) during the five - and - a - half hour flight
authorities are questioning how multiple security *systems* managed to miss the boy , who wo n't face charges
neighbors expressed their shock that it was the ' quiet ' boy on their block
