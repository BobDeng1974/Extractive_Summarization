@entity0 has issued a withering riposte to @entity2 after the @entity4 striker accused his manager of disrespecting him			1
the @entity6 , 27 , has been allowed to join @entity7 on loan for the rest of the season , even though top scorer @entity11 will be spending january at the @entity12 with @entity13			2
@entity2 claimed @entity0 froze him out , adding : ‘ he has made it difficult for me ever since i arrived			2
’ @entity4 boss @entity0 says @entity2 is having a medical at @entity7 ahead of a loan move the @entity6 was the first of nine signings made by @entity4 in the summer but has n't nailed down a spot co-owner @entity21 sanctioned the three - year deal for @entity2 in the close season			1
@entity0 argued that the only reason @entity2 ’s time on the pitch had been limited was because he had not been good enough to displace @entity11 , @entity28 star @entity27 or @entity30 ’s @entity29			1
‘ clearly he ’s a lad who is very frustrated at not being picked but all of what he is saying is not true , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ he was n’t playing because he was n’t good enough			0
not good enough is a bit harsh because he is talented and he ’s contributed well			0
but he ’s not good enough to play as regularly as he wants compared to the others			0
it ’s as simple as that			0
@entity2 says he 's out of favour with @entity0 because he was brought in by co-chairman @entity21 @entity2 has also been the victim of the excellent form of fellow new signings such as @entity27 ‘ when you look at @entity44 , @entity11 and @entity29 and what they have achieved and what @entity2 has achieved when he ’s played , when we look at what he has contributed all round , and you have got that array of talent to choose from , then somebody ’s going to be not happy			1
‘ then you ’ve got @entity52 sitting on the bench not coming on			0
he ’s had more of a chance than @entity52 , who is one of my favourites			0
he ’s a fantastic pro and a great guy , so it has nothing to do with a personal point of view			0
’ @entity0 was also bemused to be named by @entity61 as one of the rival coaches the @entity65 boss believes is part of a ‘ campaign ’ to brand his players as divers			1
@entity11 ( left ) also got off to a flyer with eight goals in 10 games but has n't scored in the last four @entity61 aired his theory after sunday ’s 1 - 1 draw at @entity75 , where @entity76 was booked for a tumble in the penalty area			0
@entity0 had been critical of @entity79 , who was not booked for what looked like a dive in @entity65 ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity4 two days earlier			1
‘ what ’s he on about ? ’ @entity0 said of @entity61 ’s claims			2
@entity0 has rejected @entity61 's claims that he has a ' campaign ' against @entity65			1

@entity2 has moved on loan to @entity7
@entity4 boss @entity0 has **denied** @entity91 was frozen out
@entity0 *insists* @entity2 was ' not good enough ' to get in @entity4 team
he also **denied** @entity61 's claims he has ' campaign ' against @entity65
