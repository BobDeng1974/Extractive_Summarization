what sort of traveller are you ? what are your favourite types of holidays ? i love all sorts			1
i love walking holidays and skiing with friends , but in recent years i 've been so busy with work that i ’m only able to go on holiday once a year			1
lately it ’s tended to be somewhere hot to unwind on a beach and scuba dive			1
because of my job i get a lot of opportunity to grab a few days here and there in many cool cities for press commitments , magazine shoots and premieres — @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity31 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			2
i always try to get to a gallery or museum if there 's time			1

we travelled down from @entity119 and into @entity16 and then much further down into @entity120			0
i loved @entity120 – fresh coconut juice every day ! the train system in @entity39 is chaotic and fun – it 's the best way to see the landscape			1

first of all , my yoga mat comes everywhere			0
keeps me stretched out after sitting still on all those planes , trains and road journeys			0
you need a great hat too			0
if it 's hot it 'll keep the sun off your face , if it 's cold it will keep the heat in , if you need to sleep you pull it down over your eyes and if your hair is starting to get a bit greasy from all the travelling , it hides it when you 're in desperate need of a shower ! what ’s the most amazing shoot location you ’ve been on for @entity1 ? the most amazing set where i ’ve shot @entity1 is definitely @entity109 , in @entity202			1
it ’s such a stunning country with lots of good watersports there as well			0
just a beautiful , beautiful place			0

travel also shows you the diverse wildlife we share this planet with and gives you perspective on just how huge the @entity224 is			0
my first time to @entity31 was when i was backpacking with my best friend around @entity32 for a month at 18 years old , so i remember that excitement of being away from home properly for the first time .			0
