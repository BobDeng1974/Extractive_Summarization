@entity0 has conceded that the spectre of @entity2 will never be far from his mind when he steps in the ring for his welterweight showdown with @entity6 in @entity7 in the early hours of sunday morning			1
@entity0 has spent the majority of the pre-fight build - up insisting he is only concerned with the immediate threat posed by the former @entity12 champion and that there remain plenty of other options in the 147lbs division			2
but the 28 - year - old @entity18 native betrayed his true concerns when questioned over his ability to see off @entity6 in explosive enough style to make the prospect of a future showdown with the self - styled ' @entity2 ' a reality			1
@entity0 and @entity6 square up to each other during their final pre-fight press conference @entity0 said : ' i want the boxing fans around the world to demand a fight between me and @entity2 - i want them to demand it when they see @entity0 in such a good fight			1
' they 're going to be like , ' wow , he should fight @entity2 '			0
i do n't just want it to happen , i want people demanding it			0
it 's going to be a tough fight but i do n't just want to win it , i want to win it in style			0
' time will determine the extent of the mistake @entity0 made a year ago when he pulled out of a prospective showdown with the then @entity12 champion in the mistaken belief he had already landed a dream @entity2 bout			2
@entity0 has spent the majority of the pre-fight build - up insisting he is only concerned with @entity6 instead @entity2 chose to face former @entity0 foe @entity51 , leaving @entity0 out in the cold , and he spent a 14 - month absence from the ring before returning to outpoint @entity55 in may			1
the prize for beating @entity6 could be huge , and @entity0 insists his work with trainer @entity58 has helped blend his natural inclination to attack with a more measured approach that should serve him well			1
' i 'm still going to be the fighter that i 've always been but i 'm just going to be smarter , " added @entity0			0
' when i put an attack together there has got to be a reason for it			0
' you can be exciting and come forward and throw a lot of punches , but be careful at the same time			0
that 's what @entity58 has brought to the table - he has made me a fighter who understands everything i have to do in the ring			2
" @entity0 has conceded that the spectre of @entity2 ( above ) will never be far from his mind despite @entity0 's workmanlike win over @entity80 there remain questions over his ability to cope at the higher weight , having previously flapped to an unconvincing points win over an ageing @entity86 in @entity87 in april 2013			2
@entity6 lost his title to fellow @entity90 @entity89 a year ago but also has much to prove despite a good enough comeback win over @entity92 in june			1
@entity6 echoed @entity0 's sentiments when he said : ' i definitely need to win and i want to look good doing it			1
' i think a lot of people are going to be looking at this fight and saying , ' this is the future of the welterweights '			0
i 've got to pull out all the stops for this fight and go out there and just be me			0
