just three days later , a police boat was seen in @entity3 waters again , in what locals described as a rebuke to the @entity10 protest			1
@entity15 news website @entity25 posted a photograph of the boat , which apparently set out from its base in the port of @entity31 and made two incursions into the waters around @entity5			1

' this incident , given what has now been established , is so serious that it is right that i should refer it directly to the prime minister , ' he said			0
' i will be doing so , accompanying what i send him with the relevant data for his information			0
' @entity4 's foreign ministry denied that any shots were fired , and accused the @entity88 of granting too much crebility to a ' rumour '			1
a spokesman said : ' @entity4 will be communicating to @entity3 its unease at the fact it has accepted an unconfirmed and false rumour which affects the relationship between two partners and allies			1

there were three policemen on the boat and i actually saw one of them with a gun in his hand			0
the sovereignty of @entity5 is a major source of tension between the @entity3 and @entity4			1
both in 1967 and 2002 , the people of @entity5 rejected proposals for @entity4 sovereignty			1
yet , despite this , @entity4 still asserts a claim to the territory			2
the tension began in 1704 when an @entity133 - @entity132 force captured @entity5 from @entity4 during the war of the @entity4 succession			1
the territory was then ceded to @entity3 under the @entity137 in 1713			2
historically , it has proved to be an important base for the @entity140			0
now , its economy is based on tourism , financial services and shipping			0
under the 2006 constitution of @entity5 , the territory governs its own affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the responsibility of the @entity88			2
located on the southern end of the @entity153 , it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres			0
‘ i was just about to drop my friend off at @entity156 when i heard the first shot			0
i do n’t really think we took it seriously or believed it could be a gun , but clearly it was			0
‘ i jumped back on again and whizzed off before realising the boat was chasing after me and had soon fired three more shots at me			2
‘ i had only just taken my friend ’s ten - year - old daughter out for a spin and was about to pick up her grandmother so we were not being threatening or doing anything wrong			0
‘ maybe these guys were bored – it being a sunday – but i really hope something is going to be done about it , as it is outrageous			0
’ shots can be heard on a grainy video filmed by a witness			0
@entity3 sources said it was thought the @entity4 police fired rubber bullets at the man			1
witness @entity181 described the @entity13 as ‘ trigger - happy ’ , adding : ‘ the @entity10 has to do something now because when someone is shot in our waters then everybody will start flapping			0
’ the @entity3 ’s charge d’affaires in @entity188 was also despatched to make direct representations to ministers in the @entity4 capital			2
the incident is believed to have been witnessed by an off - duty officer from the @entity194 , which has launched a formal investigation			0
but a spokesman for @entity4 ’s @entity197 said ‘ no incident ’ had taken place ’ and ‘ no shot fired ’			2
@entity3 was given @entity5 in the @entity137 , but @entity4 has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty			1
@entity3 sources said @entity5 suffered frequent illegal incursions into its waters by @entity4 boats , including police and naval vessels			1
from december last year to april , officials recorded 176 illegal incursions by @entity4 boats			2
anger : the government has criticised @entity4 police after shots were fired at a @entity3 jet skier in @entity5 shooting : this map shows how the incident unfolded last november , @entity188 was accused of an unlawful incursion into @entity3 ’s territorial waters after a @entity4 warship called @entity222 , a 288ft corvette , came within three miles of @entity5 ’s coast			1
the ship ignored radio warnings to leave the area and @entity228 , a seven - man patrol boat , was scrambled to intercept			0
mr @entity70 described the incident as a ‘ scandalous act of aggression which is illegal , imprudent , unprofessional and irresponsible ’			0
in a joint statement , @entity234 meps @entity232 , @entity235 and @entity236 – who represent @entity5 in the @entity237 – said @entity4 provocation was ‘ a form of international political posturing by a struggling government which hopes to distract attention from its domestic failures ’			1
they added : ‘ for a shot to be fired will push to a new level the offence caused to the people of @entity5			2
' this action is wholly illegal and as provocative as it is reckless			0
’ action : following the shooting , a @entity253 similar to this intercepted the @entity255 and told it to leave the waters incident : the @entity259 boat which the shots were fired from is similar to this @entity13 boat			2
