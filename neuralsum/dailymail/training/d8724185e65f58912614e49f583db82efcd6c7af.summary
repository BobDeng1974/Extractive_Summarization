engaged : the honourable @entity0 , with fiancee @entity1 by his side			1
the pair plan to marry in august there is little about this casually dressed couple to suggest that you ’re in the presence of aristocracy			1
but the shaven - headed man in the hooded top is the honourable @entity0 , godson of prince @entity11 and heir to the £ 100million @entity14 fortune			1
and the woman by his side is nurse @entity1 – who , as his new fiancee , is set to become the 9th @entity17 when he one day inherits the family title			1

the couple became engaged shortly before @entity33 and have moved into a plush flat in a gated building in a fashionable part of @entity37			1
miss @entity28 , 28 , who works at a private hospital in @entity39 , is said to be a steadying influence on @entity0 who is attempting to start a career as a digital artist			1

‘ i do n’t think it will be a big affair as @entity1 likes to keep things very simple			1
when @entity51 told us about his background none of us believed it because it does n’t really matter			0
