a more complete and less weather - beaten bust is pictured right ' the statue is one of the most important finds from @entity76 and would certainly have been the most impressive , ' said dr @entity62			2
it is the largest @entity32 statue to have been discovered in @entity76 so far			0
' the problem is because the face has been so battered by weathering – possibly because it was in the sea at one point – people have felt for the last 200 years that there ’s not enough left of the face to be that precise on its identification			2
' it is a shame that it has been ignored and overlooked for so long , but now that laser scanning has helped resolve its identity , hopefully it will now take pride of place			0
