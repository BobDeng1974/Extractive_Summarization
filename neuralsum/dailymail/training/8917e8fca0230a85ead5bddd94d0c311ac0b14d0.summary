@entity0 escaped death by climbing out the window of her house in @entity4 , @entity5 a woman who lost her home and severely injured her shoulder during a plane crash that killed three people has filed a claim against the @entity12			1
@entity0 was at her home in @entity4 , @entity5 , when a four - seat 1957 @entity14 crashed into it on jan. 4 , 2013			1
the plane was headed to @entity16 , @entity17 , but was attempting to make an emergency landing at @entity19			0
@entity20 was able to escape through a window at her home moments after the plane crashed , but pilot @entity25 , 58 , and passengers @entity27 , 59 and @entity28 , 42 , were killed			1
it was @entity31 ' birthday and @entity27 and @entity32 were engaged to be married			0
@entity20 lost her home because it was deemed ' uninhabitable ' and torn down			1
she was also forced to undergo surgery on her shoulder after injuring it during her escape			2
@entity25 did not have insurance at the time of the crash , so @entity20 has been paying medical bills and other ' significant expenses ' herself			1
she filed the claim because there is no federal or state requirement for small private planes to carry insurance and believes the @entity12 should implement a policy requiring pilots to be insured against accidents			1
it 's unclear how much @entity20 is seeking in damages			2
she said : ' it seems like this is what i have to do to get someone to listen : bring a lawsuit			0
' no one should have to go through what i went through â€” to have your life destroyed and no one is accountable for that			0
' a review by the @entity80 found that both @entity31 and air traffic controllers were partly responsible for the crash , another factor that prompted @entity20 and her attorney , @entity84 , to file the claim , the @entity78 reported			2
the government has six months to analyze the claim before the case could potentially be heard in a federal court			0
a 1957 @entity14 that is very similar to the one which was being piloted by @entity31 @entity20 's home was deemed ' uninhabitable ' after the crash , one of the factors which prompted the claim @entity84 said : ' if it becomes a court case ... either a judge or jury will decide what percentage of the blame air traffic control is assigned , and they would be responsible for that share			1
' the only way i can force the government to make changes to the current regulations is to file a claim against them			0
' we want to see some change			0
i think it 's clearly obvious that the pilot played a major role in it , and he will pay no role in covering mrs. @entity0 's damages			2
' most of the plane was destroyed in the crash , but one of its wings remained intact after impact			0

@entity0 *barely* made it out of her @entity5 home after the crash
@entity4 home was deemed ' uninhabitable ' and she hurt her shoulder
@entity20 filed a claim against the @entity12 because there is no law requiring insurance for small private planes and the pilot was *uninsured*
the three people *aboard* the 1957 @entity142 died in the crash
