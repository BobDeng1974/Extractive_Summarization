by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:40 est , 27 february 2014 when @entity6 's first minister in @entity7 , @entity8 , was alerted to the scandal of poor nursing standards at a trust , his government waited over a year to order a probe @entity6 stood accused last night of presiding over abuses and cover - ups on the scale of the @entity17 healthcare scandal at another trust			1
a leaked copy of an investigation into the appalling neglect of an elderly patient found that a @entity7 trust failed to hold a proper inquiry into the case , despite having told her family that it had taken place			1
and when @entity6 ’s first minister in @entity7 , @entity8 , was alerted to the scandal of poor nursing standards at the trust , his government waited over a year to order a probe			1
eighty - two - year - old @entity34 died after a string of failings at the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39			1
she was denied life - saving medication , allowed to starve for days and left in agony because her prosthetic leg was not taken off at night			1
her son said the three years of cover - ups and delays put other patients at risk , because action to improve standards were not taken			2
dozens of other examples of poor care at the trust have emerged over the past few months – adding to fears of a @entity56 scandal in @entity7			1
three nurses have been arrested over the falsification of patient records			0
the family ’s lawyer said that the case was even worse than that of @entity56 because of the trust ’s attempt to ‘ suppress ’ criticisms and cover up failings			2
@entity34 , a mother of five who was left with one leg after an amputation , died 15 months ago after a catalogue of neglect at the hospital , which is part of the @entity76 local health board			1
in 2010 , she was admitted to the hospital with shingles , but when her family went to visit they found her lying in excrement			0
eighty - two - year - old @entity34 died after a string of failings at the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 her son @entity84 , 54 , said life - saving medicine was scattered on the floor , and she had spent the weekend without food or water			1
the family was told that police and social services would be carrying out a ‘ @entity93 ’ inquiry , and that staff would be retrained to ensure the neglect did not happen again			0
but two years later , when mrs @entity34 was admitted to a different hospital run by the same trust , she had to endure ‘ the same shameful neglect ’			1
when her son demanded to know why the improvements promised had not been implemented , the hospital admitted the inquiry had never taken place			0
‘ we ’d been lied to , ’ he said			0
a @entity105 inquiry was finally held , which found that mrs @entity34 ’s dentures had not been removed at night , that nurses failed to administer prescribed medicine , and that they failed to care for her amputated limb			1
the report , which has been seen by the @entity111 , concluded that it was ‘ proved ’ that the board had given ‘ false statements and false assurances ’ over the scope of the earlier inquiry , and that the family had been ‘ misled ’			0
under devolution , the @entity120 in @entity7 is controlled by @entity6 – not by the coalition based in @entity123 – and at the time of the failings , the trust ’s board was chaired by a former @entity6 mp @entity126			1
@entity34 's son @entity84 , 54 , said life - saving medicine was scattered on the floor , and she had spent the weekend without food or water @entity132 called earlier this month for a proper inquiry into failings of hospitals in @entity7			1
it emerged last week that the @entity120 ignored warnings from @entity138 that death rates at hospitals like the one in @entity38 were dangerously high			2
the health secretary said : ‘ these tragic examples of poor care in @entity6 - controlled @entity7 deserve proper public scrutiny			1
it is a total betrayal of patients in @entity7 to think the lessons of @entity56 somehow stop at the border			2
’ mr @entity149 notified @entity7 first minister @entity8 of the case in june 2012 , but it took until october 2013 for @entity7 health minister @entity152 to call a public review into standards at the trust			1
last night mr @entity8 said he was involved in the case not as first minister but as mr @entity149 ’s local assembly member			1
he said : ‘ it is simply not true to say that no action has been taken by myself			0
i met with him and made several representations on his behalf			0
’ last night a source at the @entity76 trust denied there had been a cover - up and said there had been a misunderstanding over what sort of inquiry was going to be held			2
the source said that although there had not been a @entity105 inquiry with police and social services involvement in 2010 , there had been an internal investigation			0
@entity34 ’s family only found out that an inquiry had not taken place into her appalling care in 2010 when she was admitted to hospital again two years later			2
when mrs @entity34 , pictured , became ill in august 2012 , she begged her son @entity84 not to take her back to the @entity37 , so they went to the neighbouring @entity185 , part of the same trust			1
however mr @entity149 said the standard of care at the second hospital was even worse than before			0
‘ we found her slumped in the chair amid pools of urine , tablets dropped and dissolved , bloody swabs hanging around , ’ he recalled			0
‘ two years on , we were finding the same shocking neglect			0
what this showed is that it was endemic throughout the trust ; this culture of nonchalance and indifference			0
’ later in the year she was admitted a final time			2
as her life ebbed away , the doctors withdrew treatment because they said she had pneumonia			0
but the post-mortem examination showed she had n’t had pneumonia at all			0
her death was put down to a heart attack , probably due to the withdrawal of anti-blood clot medication			0
after the @entity105 inquiry found that mrs @entity34 had been treated badly , the police began to look at the hospital and have arrested three nurses for fabricating blood sugar records			2
mr @entity149 said : ‘ three nurses have been hung out to dry to protect management , to cover up that fabrication of records had been going on for years			0

@entity34 died after failings at @entity37 , @entity38
denied life - saving medication , and allowed to starve for days
@entity6 's first minister in @entity7 @entity8 was alerted to the scandal
but it 's been revealed his government waited over a year to order a probe
