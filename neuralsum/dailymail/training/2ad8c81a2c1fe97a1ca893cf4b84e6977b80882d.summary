you buy her flowers , shower her with compliments and listen to everything she says			0
yet she does n’t want to see you again			0
if scientists are right , you were simply too nice			1
research into first dates suggests that while men like a woman who hangs onto their every word , women are less impressed by nice men			1
too much ? research has suggested that being too attentive on a date can fail to please women in fact , they may find a caring , sharing male as a bit of a wimp or even slightly creepy			1
the researchers said : ‘ women may be suspicious of a responsive stranger ’s intentions , attributing his responsiveness to possible ulterior motives			1
’ psychologists from @entity29 and the @entity30 ran three experiments in which two strangers chatted either face - to - face or online			1
one member of the pair was instructed to unburden themselves of a problem that was troubling them , from money worries to a failed exam or an argument with friend , while the second listened and responded			0
creepy ? it has been suggested that being too nice can lead women to think a date has ulterior motives the men liked being paired with a woman who was caring and sympathetic			1
such a female was rated as being more feminine and more attractive			0
plus , a woman who was a good listener was seen as potential for a long - term relationships , the @entity54 reports			2
it seems a woman ’s concern may have boosted the male ego , as well as making her seem like good mother material			0
lead researcher @entity60 , of the @entity61 in @entity29 , said : ‘ men may interpret women ’s responsiveness as a sign of sexual interest and react accordingly by perceiving them as more attractive			1
’ however , the women did not find a caring man more appealing or any more masculine			0
if anything , they found him slightly less attractive			2
the researchers believe that this does n’t necessarily mean women are hard - hearted			1
instead , the different reactions of the women taking part may simply have cancelled each other out			0
for instance , a caring man may have be viewed as a good catch , a wimp or a creep			0
dr @entity60 said : ‘ women may perceive this man as inappropriately nice and manipulative - i.e. trying to obtain sexual favours , or eager to please , perhaps even as desperate , and therefore less sexually appealing			2
‘ alternatively women may perceive a responsive man as vulnerable and less dominant			2
‘ other women may perceive a responsive stranger as warm and caring and therefore as a desirable long - term partner			1
‘ regardless of the reasons , perhaps men should slow down if their goal is to instil sexual desire			2
‘ sexual desire thrives on rising intimacy and being responsive is one of the best ways to instil this elusive sensation over time			0
‘ our finding show this does not necessarily hold true in an initial encounter because a responsive potential partner may convey opposite meanings to different people			0

researchers simulated *dozens* of first dates - and responsive men lost out
@entity30 and @entity29 scientists found some dates found attentive men creepy
it was suggested that being too fawning suggests and ulterior motive
