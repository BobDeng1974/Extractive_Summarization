by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 13 july 2013 updated : 16:07 est , 13 july 2013 dusk is a wonderful time in the grounds of @entity4 , a luxurious thatched house deep in the @entity7 countryside			1
as the sun sets over @entity11 and the treetops of @entity13 are bathed in the day ’s last light , a herd of fallow deer gather in the back garden			1
while the fawns , only weeks old , gambol in the meadows , the older bucks and does munch apples from the hands of owners @entity22 and @entity23			0
close to nature : @entity25 , 58 , feeds the deer at @entity4 which her and her husband are now selling for £ 900,000 by the time night has fallen , the deer have retreated to the woods , and an even more magical show begins			1
beneath the window of a downstairs bedroom a group of badgers is clawing at the wall , waiting for @entity23 and @entity22 to arrive with treats of bird nuts and the odd @entity38 , which they chomp noisily			0
the bolder ones even poke their snouts through the cat flap , and when feeding time is over they use the decking as a race track			0
‘ they started coming into the garden and eating nuts that had fallen from the bird - feeders and then they came closer to the house , ’ says @entity23 , 58 , a journalist			1
‘ we get pheasants in the kitchen and every morning @entity22 has to move the buck that sleeps next to his car			0
if i go for a walk in the fields and woods , fallow deer , cats , pheasants , the occasional badger and two robins trail along behind me			1
’ thatched dream : the garden outside the three - bedroom @entity7 home is frequently visited by the local wildlife the deer have been giving birth recently and the garden doubles as a creche			1
‘ fawns are the funniest , cutest creatures you can imagine – a bit like lambs but even faster and more bouncy , ’ says @entity23			0
‘ and every year we get to watch the rut , in which the bucks fight for supremacy , from the comfort of our armchairs			0
the noise and bellowing is terrific			0
’ the couple bought the detached three - bedroom house with 12 acres in 1999 for £ 280,000 , and gradually the local fauna joined them			1
‘ we decided to buy it before we ’d been inside – we ’d arranged to meet the estate agent and arrived early , so walked around the garden and found a fawn asleep in the grass , ’ says @entity23 , who is selling the house through @entity92 ( 01392 455755 ) for £ 895,000			1
although the animals are far from tame , they seem unfazed by human activity			0
‘ we can have as many as 30 friends eating outside with a herd of deer grazing next to us , ’ says @entity22 , 62 , a photographer			1
‘ we do n’t cosset them – we just let them be themselves and that ’s what makes it so special			0
’ high ceilings : the upstairs sitting room at @entity4 which sits above the pretty village of @entity113 in the @entity114 , seven miles from @entity115 unexpected guests : when current owner @entity23 cooks in the 28ft long , kitchen , she is often visited by the near - tame deer heard , looking for food the delightful cottage garden has been fenced to prevent damage from deer , but when dormice set up home in @entity22 ’s vegetable garden he left them there and has not picked up his hoe since			1
@entity130 sits above the pretty village of @entity113 in the @entity114 , seven miles from @entity115			1
internally , the house is a blend of ancient and contemporary			2
it was built 20 years ago in the style of a country cottage but has high ceilings , large rooms , vast windows and the mod cons not usually associated with thatched houses – as well as underfloor heating and air - conditioning , the house has a @entity143			2
it is all rather surprising as the house was originally conceived as a modest dwelling for a part - time pig - breeder , but when his business went under it was repossessed and the @entity151 stepped in			2
the kitchen , 28ft long , is the hub of the house and has views over their land and beyond , and when the deer see @entity23 at the sink they amble to the window in search of food			1
badgering for treats : as the night falls , local badgers scratch at the bedroom walls and happily munch away at bird nuts and @entity38 which the @entity151 feed them the main sitting room , again huge , has a vaulted ceiling and large stone fireplace , and is on the first floor to take full advantage of the views			0
also upstairs is the master bedroom , with another fireplace and an en suite shower and bathroom , but the two other bedrooms , and a family bathroom , are at ground level			2
in the park - like grounds there is an old piggery that now doubles as a garage and a roost for swallows , sparrows and bats , but it could be converted for commercial use			0
as well as the formal gardens and meadows , the grounds encompass forestry and a brook from which the deer drink			1
it is hard to see why the couple want to move from this idyllic spot , but they are house - hunting in @entity200			2
they admit they ’ll struggle to find something as beautiful and they will not find the wildlife , as the @entity200 tend to shoot anything on four legs			0
their cat , @entity210 , will also miss his playmates			0
‘ he hides in the long grass until the bucks graze close enough for him to launch himself at their heads , ’ says @entity22			0
‘ then he hangs on until they shake him off and he ’s somersaulted away before making a mad dash for the safety of the house with a buck in full flight right behind him			2

@entity130 in @entity114 , @entity7 is on the *market* for £ 900,000
potential buyers can look forward to deer and birds joining for dinner
three bedrooms house also has its own brook and forestry
