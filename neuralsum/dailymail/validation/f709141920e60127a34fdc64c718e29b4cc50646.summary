it was a weekend when @entity1 was full to bursting with emotion , but he struck a note of pragmatism after leading @entity5 to @entity7 victory			1
the din of what is the closest he can get to a home - town crowd was still ringing in his ears as he considered the implications of a 3 - 2 victory over america - one that has again put @entity17 ’s squad into the last eight of the sport ’s premier team competition			1
@entity22 ’s host nation may not be able to raise a quorum when it comes to volume of players in the world ’s top 100 , but where there is @entity1 , there is hope			1
@entity1 celebrates as his win over @entity34 leads @entity5 into the @entity7 's last eight @entity1 celebrates during his straight sets win over @entity34 that clinched the @entity37 a quarter - final place @entity1 produced the right results in points at key moments to overcome the fancied @entity42 he showed that again as he held off a ferocious challenge from 6ft 10in @entity34 to win 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 and push @entity5 into a july quarter - final against @entity46			1
yet he was cautious about whether that could actually lead to @entity48 winning the @entity7 for the first time since 1936			2
‘ to win the event is an extremely difficult thing to do , ’ he said			2
‘ even with someone like @entity54 , such a great player , it ’s taken him to have a top five in the world partner ( @entity57 ) to help him to do that			0
we ’re playing at the limits of our level right now			0
’ if he was merely being realistic there was not , after all , a great deal of time for heady celebration			0
such are the demands of the tour that he was flying back to @entity69 on sunday night and then flying on monday morning to @entity70 for the season ’s first masters level event at @entity73			0
accompanying him will be @entity74 , without whom none of this weekend ’s triumph would have been possible			2
@entity1 was the star but this was truly an @entity80 - @entity79 enterprise at a time when such things are under threat			1
@entity74 turned the tie in @entity5 's favour with his own victory over @entity34 on friday @entity74 took the first two sets in the dead rubber against @entity89 but retired to protect his knee @entity74 ’s friday night epic against @entity34 turned this match in the home side ’s favour - just as he had 13 months ago in the corresponding first - round match against @entity96 , when he defeated @entity97			1
the 28 - year - old @entity69 is one of those players who grows an extra three inches in the team environment , but it is expecting a lot of a player outside the world ’s top 100 to keep the upsets coming			1
@entity74 even took the first set against @entity89 in the dead rubber after @entity1 ’s victory on sunday but then conceded the match to protect his sore knee			1
when asked about his side ’s potential , @entity17 said : ‘ we have still got a bit of work to do but we are getting closer			0
we can trouble most teams			0
you ’ve seen the spirit we have			0
’ the victorious @entity5 team smile with clenched fists after their 3 - 2 win over the @entity42 the @entity37 gather on the court after their win which sets up a clash with @entity46 in the quarter - finals this was another triumph for @entity17			1
in an era when big - name ex-players are all the rage as coaches , he continues to land blows for the lower - profile professional			0
for the second consecutive time he has got the better of former world no 1 @entity136 in the captain ’s chair			0
@entity1 is not only among the planet ’s best tennis players , he has also shown what a team man he is this weekend with his passionate support from the sidelines			2
if there is a worry , it is that it may all have sapped him			0
it helped that the 7,700 capacity crowd was intent on dragging him over the line			0
no wonder the debate over the next month will be whether the advantage of grass in the next round is outweighed by the passion of playing in @entity79 on a hard court			0
@entity1 , embracing @entity48 team captain @entity17 , praised the ' effort and attitude of everyone in the team ' @entity5 captain @entity17 celebrate as their talisman @entity1 wins a crucial point against @entity164 20 @entity34 @entity1 said : ‘ i knew that @entity74 was extremely tired and i knew it would be a very tough ask for him to come out and win that match ( yesterday ’s final singles ) after me			1
there is pressure to help your team - mates out and i wanted to try and finish the tie there			1
‘ i was very emotional all weekend — it is quite draining			0
i was proud of the team , the way they performed and fought in this arena under so much pressure			0
’ @entity34 was desperate to make amends for friday and had come out swinging in the first set against @entity1 , backing up his enormous serve with early strikes in rallies designed to prevent any long exchanges			1
he forced seven break points en route to the tiebreak including three set points at 5 - 4 , which saw him taking huge cuts at @entity1 ’s more vulnerable second serve			2
what it came down to was @entity1 ’s greater sangfroid in the tiebreak , which @entity34 began with a double fault			1
that first set settled the nerves of @entity1 and the crowd and he broke for 4 - 2 in the second with an exquisite lob — no mean feat against a giraffe - like opponent			2
to @entity34 ’s credit , he kept fighting			2
but the second tiebreak followed much the same pattern as the first and was sealed 7 - 4 with a swinging ace which met with a cacophony that nearly blew the roof off			0
it was the kind of supreme effort from @entity1 that is all too easily taken for granted			2
@entity213 fell to @entity1 after @entity74 come from two sets down to beat him in an epic tussle @entity34 took responsibility for the loss saying ' this one 's on me ' after his loss to @entity74 @entity34 , however , says there were ew players in the world who could have conquered @entity1 in @entity224			1

@entity1 beat @entity34 in straight sets to secure @entity48 win over @entity42
@entity1 's @entity48 team - mate @entity74 had before upset world no 20 @entity34
the @entity230 said @entity48 are playing at their limit having moved into the last eight
@entity5 will face @entity46 at home in the quarter - finals in july
