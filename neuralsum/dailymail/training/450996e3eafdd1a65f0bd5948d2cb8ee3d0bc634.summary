we 've all been there after a big night out , or a lazy sunday morning			1
feeling a bit worse for wear and wanting the only thing can provide the cure - a great mound of fast - food delivered straight to the door			2
and now , thanks to @entity12 's @entity11 franchise - delivering well - known takeaways and meals straight to the sofa - those needs can be catered for			1
@entity12 and delivery driver @entity16 with their @entity11 car			2
the franchise business was started by ms @entity19 , 31 and runs nightly from 6pm to 10pm			1
meals from fast food chains such as @entity22 's , @entity23 ( pictured ) , @entity24 and @entity25 are on offer ms @entity19 , from @entity27 , delivers meals from @entity22 's , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 - adding a 20 per cent mark - up cost on top of the food price			1
the 31 - year - old even offers sunday roasts from local pub @entity34 , in @entity35 , @entity27			1
but she said it 's not just the hungover masses making use of the new service - in fact it 's mainly people who are just keen to enjoy their favourite takeaway in their pjs			0
ms @entity19 , from @entity45 , who has a fleet of delivery drivers , said : ' i was looking for something to do for extra cash and i saw the franchise advertised on a jobs ' website			2
' i just thought that i 'd give it a go , ' she continued			0
a golf enthusiast , ms @entity19 works full - time as an optician dispenser , and runs the service nightly between 6pm and 10pm			2
she also accepts delivery orders on a sunday morning and afternoon sunday roasts from local pub @entity34 , in @entity35 , @entity27 ( pictured ) are on offer ms @entity19 has done a saturday on an ad - hoc basis and is looking to also eventually increase the times and areas she covers - as well as the scope of restaurants			1
deliveries are to all of @entity27 and in the @entity70 town centre area			0
a specialist kit is used to keep the food fresh and warm en - route and her profit comes from a mark - up of the food of around 20 per cent as delivery is free			0
she added : ' it 's been going great and we have lots of regular customers			0
' @entity83 is the clear favourite - and there is one guy who just orders @entity87			0
' there are a lot of students			0
