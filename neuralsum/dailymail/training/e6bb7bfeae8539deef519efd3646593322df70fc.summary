by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are planning the most radical overhaul of @entity4 in its 125 - year history in a bid to preserve the ground 's test match status			1
the county want to rebuild one of the stands and the pavilion and up the capacity from 17,000 to 20,000 , making it a world - class venue			2
@entity4 will always be synonymous with the famous @entity15 of 1981 , when @entity16 dragged @entity17 to victory from a seemingly impossible position and them @entity20 finished the job with the ball			1
grounds for optimism : an image of the proposed @entity26 at @entity4 aerial view : a sketch of what the new @entity4 will look like from the sky but @entity2 chairman @entity31 acknowledged that if the ground was to be the scene of any more epic tests			1
@entity31 said : ' this is the most ambitious project the club and the venue will have undertaken since the ground was first established 125 years ago			0
' our ambitions are clear			0
we want to create a stadium that is amongst finest in the world and enable @entity2 to continue to stage major international fixtures over the long term			2
' it is vital that we do n’t lose sight of our objectives			0
as other venues around the country continue to invest in their facilities , we can not afford to standstill and expect that @entity4 will always host international cricket			1
' the stark reality is that if our stadium fails to evolve we will lose our test match status , which would be a devastating blow to the region			0
' finest hour : @entity16 ( centre ) starred as @entity17 won the famous 1981 @entity15 at @entity4 the renovation will be in six stages and will include the addition of permanent floodlights , the redevelopment of the stand connected to the neighbouring rugby ground and a new pavilion in the north - west corner of the ground			1
nearly 1,000 seats will also be added to the north - east stand			0
a new pavilion and media centre were built at @entity4 in 2010			0
@entity4 will host this summer ’s second test match against @entity74 beginning on june 20 , as well as the fifth one - day international against @entity75 on september 5 and will also host a test against @entity77 and an odi against @entity79 in 2015 .			2
