@entity0 has warned @entity1 it is ‘ not easy ’ to bring academy players into the first team and that their state - of - the - art academy wo n’t guarantee a higher standard of youth players			1
@entity1 opened their new £ 200million headquarters on monday with the view to becoming a factory for bringing through talent			1
it eclipses the £ 30m @entity13 spent in 2005 on their academy			1
@entity0 will hand 18 - year - old @entity15 — at the club since he was eight — his first - team debut against @entity18 , and maintains splashing millions on state - of - the - art facilities does not guarantee results			1
@entity15 is all set to be handed his @entity13 debut during their dead - rubber against @entity18 @entity13 welcome @entity18 to @entity24 in their final @entity26 group match @entity27 ( centre ) warms up alongside some of his more inexperienced colleagues on tuesday @entity0 said : ‘ it depends on the talent you have			1
every manager in the world wants to bring young people up			0
i can compare my first spell here to now , and now the quality of the young players is clearly better			2
‘ i ’m not saying they ’re ready , but the quality is much better			0
‘ go to other clubs , it ’s clear it ’s not easy to bring kids from the youth competitions to the top level , but every one has the same feeling			0
we want to do it			0
’ the @entity13 manager hailed their match against @entity18 as their ‘ @entity55 ’ , celebrating the fact that young players are breaking through to the senior squad			1
@entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 have been given a break by @entity0 with @entity13 already qualified at the top of @entity64 that made room for @entity15 and defender @entity67 , 19 , in training			2
@entity69 , who is expected to start on the bench but will play some part , has trained with the senior squad every day for the past three weeks			0
@entity67 has been on the fringes of the first team this campaign			2
he has started twice in the @entity76 and made a substitute appearance in the 6 - 0 win against @entity79			2
but in recent years the chances for youngsters have been limited and @entity59 , 34 , is the last player to come through the academy and become a regular in the first team			2
@entity13 's @entity15 ( centre ) was among the youngsters getting involved in the 11.30am session @entity67 , 19 , @entity15 , 18 , and @entity87 , 19 , were all out for the training session on tuesday @entity89 out for @entity13 training on tuesday but @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 were absent ‘ the people in the academy feel they are working for something , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ which is why it is not @entity96 ’s day but “ @entity97 ”			0
’ @entity0 also warned that unless clubs allow managers to work long - term , academies will not work			1
he has started making plans for the future regarding how to integrate young players into his first team			2
‘ if you do n’t bring kids through the academy , the best thing is to close it			2
‘ if the kids are not good enough or the work not good enough , close the door and use the money to buy players			0
‘ you need to prove the academy works well and is worth it			0
it ’s only possible if the first - team manager stays for a long time , which in this club in the last 10 years was not possible			1
now i ’m trying to format @entity96 and other @entity122 in relation to my ideas			0
‘ the relation between the first - team and the academy is changing with this stability we are having			1
’ @entity129 , who is set to be handed his @entity13 debut against @entity18 on wednesday night , is regarded as one of the country 's brightest emerging talents			1
the 6ft 4in central midfielder , 18 , has earned rave reviews for his composed play and passing in central midfield and looks well - equipped to make the step up			2
hailing from @entity139 , south @entity140 , @entity15 first pulled on a blue shirt for the @entity143 team and is , as @entity0 said , very much ' made in @entity13			1
' graduating through the @entity24 schoolboy teams , he was appearing for the under - 18s three years ahead of schedule and captaining @entity149 schoolboys in the @entity150			1
the maturity and energy he demonstrated in the box - to - box midfield role won admiring glances from a number of big clubs , including @entity158 , and prompted @entity13 to tie down his future @entity160 lifts the @entity161 after @entity13 beat @entity162 in last season 's final the central midfielder in action for @entity13 's under 21 team in a @entity76 match against @entity169 last season @entity15 is always a willing outlet for the defenders and , with head up pressing forward , is adept at picking the right pass			1
tall and strong , he is rarely dispossessed either , but it is his composure on the ball that is most eye - catching			0
he never looks rushed and always seems to be in acres of space			0
the breakthrough season came in 2012 - 2013 , when @entity69 played a starring role as @entity13 progressed to the final of the @entity161 and the @entity184 , though both ended in defeat			0
selection for the under 21 side soon followed and he started two post-season first team friendlies against @entity1 out in the @entity191			1
@entity15 helped @entity13 to victory in the @entity193 , playing in the 2 - 1 win in the final at @entity196			0
he also played a full part in @entity13 's @entity161 success , captaining the team			0
this season , he has been a mainstay of @entity13 's under 21 side and has also participated in the @entity203			0
@entity15 has been capped for @entity149 up to under 19 level and has six goals in 10 matches at that standard			0

@entity0 will give his academy players a chance against @entity18
@entity160 will make his first - team debut on wednesday night
