public health officials in the @entity1 are grappling with a skyrocketing number of cases of a debilitating mosquito virus as @entity1 holidaymakers return from countries where an outbreak is rapidly spreading			1
nearly 200 @entity1 tourists have been diagnosed with chikungunya in 2014 as the number of cases has quintupled in a little more than two months , according to figures released by @entity13 on friday			1
of those , 162 have been associated with travel to the @entity16 and @entity17 and @entity18 , where health experts say the deadly outbreak is likely to get worse			1
the latest figures represent a 432 per cent increase from the last update on september 16 , when just 37 cases had been reported in the @entity1			2
the countries from which cases have been most frequently reported include @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
dr @entity39 , travel and migrant health expert at @entity13 , said : ‘ @entity42 is an unpleasant viral illness that can cause fever and joint pains which in some patients may persist for a prolonged period			1
‘ it is spread by mosquitos and is more usually found in parts of @entity51 and @entity52 but in recent years we have seen new areas of the world becoming affected , including the @entity16 and other parts of the @entity57			1
’ dr @entity58 , director of the @entity59 and @entity60 , added : ‘ there is no vaccine to prevent chikungunya			2
‘ anyone returning from affected areas with symptoms such as fever and joint pain should seek medical advice			0
’ the chikungunya virus , transmitted through infected mosquito bites , has spread to more than 30 @entity16 nations since it was first reported by the @entity73 in december 2013 , when a case was discovered in @entity75 , a @entity76 overseas territory			1
with more than 700,000 suspected cases and approximately 120 deaths reported , experts are telling tourists to protect themselves if they are heading to the region for winter sun. earlier this month , the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) reported more than 1,600 travellers returning to the @entity85 with chikungunya as of november 4			1
more cases are being reported every day on the island as victims arrive at hospitals or surgeries with chikungunya symptoms , including fever , headaches , rashes and muscle and joint pain			1
the worst of the outbreak in the @entity16 is occurring in the @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , where more than 600,000 suspected cases have been reported			1
most of the @entity1 cases involve tourists who visited @entity36 ( pictured ) , @entity37 and @entity38 dr @entity108 , head of @entity13 ’s rare and imported pathogens laboratory , said : ‘ @entity42 is now a common infection in travellers from the @entity16 , and is currently reported more frequently than dengue			1
‘ the @entity114 mosquitoes which spread the disease are most active during daylight hours			0
‘ particular vigilance with bite avoidance should be taken around dawn and dusk			0
‘ doctors should consider chikungunya in patients with a fever who return from the @entity16 , especially if they have symptoms of arthritis , and test them for the disease			1
’ a tourist makes a purchase at a fruit and vegetable market in @entity38 , where some @entity133 have fallen ill dr @entity134 , an infectious disease ecologist with the @entity136 , told @entity137 earlier this month that people should speak to their gp or a travel doctor before their trip			1
once they arrive , they should keep their skin covered during the day , as mosquitoes are ‘ day biters ’ , and regularly apply insect repellent containing @entity146 , he said			0
and they should seek immediate medical attention at the onset of symptoms			0
he said : ‘ for most people within three to seven days they ’ll have fever , then joint pain in the hands and wrists can persist for weeks or even months			0
‘ the joint pain can spread and can be quite debilitating			0
’ normally , the majority of @entity1 cases are associated with travel to @entity17 and @entity51 , say experts patients are often left bedridden but they can recover within three to five days with proper treatment			2
dr @entity134 said the elderly are at particular risk of developing severe symptoms that can result in death			0
trials of an anti-viral drug in the @entity85 have had positive results , but there is currently no vaccine commercially available			0
a small number of cases result in death and up to 10 per cent of patients suffer from arthritis , chronic joint pain and fatigue			2
complications can include hepatitis , myocarditis ( inflammation of the heart muscle ) , and neurological and ocular disorders			0
experts are telling holidaymakers to cover up while visiting @entity37 ( pictured ) and other islands dr @entity134 said the symptoms of chikungunya and dengue fever , also spread by infected mosquitoes , are similar , so people who believe they are infected should seek a proper lab diagnosis			1
the virus does not occur in the @entity1 but @entity13 has been monitoring for signs of infected blood - suckers			2
despite the rise in cases involving tourists who visited the @entity57 , a majority of @entity1 cases are associated with travel to @entity17 and @entity51 , @entity200 says			1
in october , lab tests confirmed four people contracted the virus in @entity210 , @entity76 – prompting fears it could spread to the @entity1			0
@entity42 is a viral disease transmitted by infected female mosquitoes with symptoms including high fever , headaches , rashes and severe joint pain			0
after being bitten the onset of illness occurs usually between four and eight days but can range from two to 12			0
there is no vaccine or cure and treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms			0
most patients recover fully but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months or even years			2
occasional cases of eye , neurological and heart complications have been reported , in addition to gastrointestinal complaints			2
serious complications are not common , but in older people , the disease can contribute to the cause of death			0
the disease was first described during an outbreak in @entity243 in 1952 and has spread to nearly 40 countries in @entity51 , @entity52 , the @entity57 and @entity245			1
@entity245 ’s first transmission was reported during a localised outbreak that affected nearly 200 people in north - eastern @entity249 in 2007			1
last month , @entity76 confirmed four cases of ‘ locally - acquired ’ infection in @entity210			0
since 2005 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 have reported over 1.9 million cases			2
experts say chikungunya shares some clinical signs with dengue and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common			0
the name ‘ chikungunya ’ derives from a word in the @entity266 language , meaning ‘ to become contorted ’ and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain			0
