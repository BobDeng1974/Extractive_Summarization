pictured : @entity5 's biological daughter @entity13 , 17 , and her eight adopted brothers @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 after a whirlwind romance he proposed six months after their first date and they were married a year later			1
they were both to keen expand their family , but they discovered conceiving naturally was very unlikely			1
the couple decided to become foster parents in december 2003 after @entity5 visited her aunt who was a foster carer and was inspired by her story			2
@entity5 and @entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , are now parents to eight brothers ranging from young teens to a baby			1
pictured : the couple with their newest addition @entity26 they enrolled in foster parent training for ten weeks , although @entity5 admits they ' wondered if all the red tape and hoops were worth it or if we ’d ever get through the classes as the weeks seemed to drag			2
' but the couple eventually qualified and were awarded their license - a few weeks later received their first case			0
they were told there was a sibling group of five and two of the younger boys needed emergency care			0
@entity5 admit they panicked about the idea of two young charges , but agreed to take @entity19 , three and his brother @entity20 , 22 months			1
' almost instantaneously these two seem to capture our hearts , and it was n’t very long before i knew that if the chance arose i wanted to have them in our lives forever			0
perhaps it was fate , perhaps it was divine intervention , i do n’t know , but what i do know was that the boys ’ ‘ short ’ stay with us turned into adoption , ' she says			0
the family line up to celebrate @entity26 's adoption being officially recognized			2
@entity5 says @entity26 is just over a year now and he teaches ' us patience and unconditional love daily and i ca n’t imagine life without him ' the couple continued to provide foster care , although they did feel the need to adopt any more children			1
but within weeks of the legal adoption going through for @entity20 and @entity19 they received a phone call from their previous case worker informing them the pair had a new brother with an immediate need for a foster placement upon his birth			1
' there was no question , how could i deny my sons and this new child the possibility of being together ? so after less than a year , our family grew yet again with the addition of @entity21 , ' says @entity5			1
' then , just eleven months later we were surprised with another call concerning the arrival of another newborn brother , @entity22			0
' born with a cleft lip , drug exposed , and premature , this little guy had a rough road ahead , but he was as much ours as our other boys ; of course we ’d accept			0
and on @entity119 they officially became a part of our family ! ' @entity5 admits at this stage people began to question her judgement , but she enjoyed her expanding family and getting to know her new sons			0
which is why the couple also adopted two more of the brothers - @entity23 joined at four - month - old and they then took on newborn @entity24 in may 2009			1
the family got into their stride and @entity5 says life was going well as the boys became accustomed to their new home			0
but then she received a @entity138 message from the boys ’ birth mom asking if they would consider adopting her unborn baby			0
' we had every reason to say no — not enough money , not enough time , etc. but somehow things seemed to fall into place and the following june we found ourselves in a hospital waiting room awaiting the arrival of our son , @entity25 , ' she says			0
' in october 2013 our soon - to - be seventh son , @entity26 , was born premature , drug exposed , and diagnosed with @entity153			2
' @entity5 says @entity26 is just over a year now and he teaches ' us patience and unconditional love daily and i ca n’t imagine life without him			1
' the family have now officially adopted him and @entity5 says : ' for us , adoption was initially just a means to complete our family when having a biological child seemed impossible			2
but , it has become so much more to us			0
it has opened our eyes , widened the horizons of our family , enriched all of our lives , and brought us so much love and happiness			0
