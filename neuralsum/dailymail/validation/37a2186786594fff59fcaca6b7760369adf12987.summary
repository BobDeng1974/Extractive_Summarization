@entity0 , 43 , from @entity1 , was convinced she was suffering panic attacks panic attacks are extremely common , with one in ten of us thought to suffer from them at least occasionally			1
@entity0 - and her doctors - were convinced she was one of the millions affected			1
a panic attack typically causes a faster heartbeat , dizziness , nausea and an overwhelming sense of anxiety			1
mother - of - two @entity0 had experienced such episodes regularly for seven years			1
' in my early 30s , i started having episodes of feeling very nervous and anxious , with butterflies in my stomach and a feeling of being on edge , ' says the 43 - year - old			1
' this could last all day			2
sometimes , i would n't know where the last 30 seconds had gone and would feel confused , but still nervous and agitated , wondering what had just happened			2
' she was prescribed antidepressants and tried talking therapies , but nothing helped			1
that 's because @entity0 , from @entity1 , @entity29 , was n't suffering from panic attacks at all , but epileptic seizures			1
her problems were neurological rather than psychological			0
and her story is not uncommon			0
as @entity36 , professor of clinical psychology at the @entity38 , explains , the symptoms of a panic attack can overlap with an epileptic seizure			1
' it 's not unusual for people with panic attacks to get an incorrect preliminary diagnosis of epilepsy , and occasionally , people with epilepsy get a misdiagnosis of panic attacks			1
if they see a specialist , it is usually clarified , ' he says			0
unfortunately , @entity0 did n't see a specialist for years			1
so how can the conditions be confused ? epilepsy , which affects more than 600,000 people in the @entity57 , is characterised by recurrent seizures or sudden bursts of intense , abnormal electrical activity in the brain that disrupt the way it works			1
but there are many kinds of epileptic seizure			2
dr @entity67 , consultant neurologist at @entity68 , @entity69 , and the @entity70 , says : ' the bit of the brain where the seizure starts and the path where the electrical discharge then spreads can vary enormously between individuals - which is why there are so many different ways people can experience an epileptic seizure			1
' one such example is with gelastic seizures - where patients may burst out laughing for no apparent reason , because the part of the brain involved in the seizure is also involved in laughter			1
other seizures may involve a feeling of deja vu , which can make diagnosis difficult , since this is ' a normal phenomenon that we all sometimes experience ' , says dr @entity67 , who is also clinical adviser to the charity @entity97			2
' as the experience is so recurrent and frequent , it usually becomes clear that something else is going on , ' she says			0
' or if the laughing attack is followed by losing consciousness and having a convulsion , diagnosis is easier			0
' @entity0 struggled to understand what was happening for seven years after her first episode but a further complication is that seizures may cause someone to panic , adds professor @entity36			1
' it 's perfectly possible that people with epilepsy will get panicky at the prospect of having a seizure			0
and in panic attacks , people hyperventilate , which can trigger an epileptic attack in people who are vulnerable to it			1
' one key differences between them is that while a seizure can lead to loss of consciousness , a panic attack usually wo n't , he says			2
but diagnosis can be hard , as there 's no definitive test for epilepsy			0
an mri scan can identify possible causes such as scarring on the brain , while an electroencephalogram , where electrodes are attached to the scalp , can help detect unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy			0
but this can also be normal in people with epilepsy , or show minor changes in people without			0
after her first episode , @entity0 looked up her symptoms online , which suggested she 'd had a panic attack			1
her gp suggested it was a delayed reaction to an incident a couple of years earlier , when she found an intruder breaking in to her house			0
' this seemed to make sense			0
i 'd been a quivering wreck at the time			0
i was a busy mum with two young kids , so i was a bit stressed			0
' the next seven years were fraught as @entity0 struggled to understand what was happening			1
she became a ' nervous wreck '			0
' i went back and forth to the doctor 's - i must have seen ten gps in total - but , each time , i was told it sounded like panic attacks or depression			1
' i remember the terms " post-traumatic disorder " and " generalised anxiety disorder " were also used			0
but there was never further investigation			0
i was given antidepressants and , one time , a valium - type drug to calm me down			1
' but the drugs did n't work , and @entity0 would stop taking them after a few months			1
@entity178 took @entity0 to the @entity149 and explained the attacks from his perspective - and her episodes were finally diagnosed corretly ' i was just told to take them again			1
i even tried cognitive behaviour therapy online and had requested counselling , but nothing helped , ' she says			2
' this just fuelled my stress			0
i became a stroppy , emotional rollercoaster			0
my poor husband , @entity178 , had to cope with me just going through the motions			0
' meanwhile , her ' panic attacks ' were getting worse : she was having five a day and experiencing urinary incontinence when they occurred			1
' a few times , i fell down the stairs and was badly bruised ; other times , i burnt myself on the oven and the iron			0
i even drove into a tree with both children in the car			0
fortunately , i was going slowly , but it was terrifying			0
at that point , i knew something was really wrong			0
' in 2011 , seven years after the panic attacks began , @entity178 took @entity0 to the gp and explained the attacks from his perspective			1
' he said that when i had an attack , i 'd involuntarily raise my arm and start tutting			0
i was n't even aware of this			0
but despite it sounding so odd , the @entity149 still seemed to think this could tie in with a panic attack , so we decided to see a neurologist privately for a second opinion			2
' the specialist diagnosed @entity0 with temporal lobe epilepsy , a common type affecting the part of the brain concerned with emotion and hearing , as well as language and memory			1
the cause , in her case , was unknown , although brain tumours , head injuries , brain infections and strokes can all cause epilepsy			0
dr @entity67 says : ' in temporal lobe seizures , common warning signs are feelings of intense anxiety , fear and panic , so these are ones more likely to be misdiagnosed as panic attacks			1
structures in and close to the temporal lobe may also cause the heart to race and the sweating that may go along with it			0
' other signs may include deja vu and some experience " gastric rising " - that feeling in the stomach when you go over a humpback bridge			2
' during the seizure , the patient may look blank and be completely amnesiac through the episode , losing a bit of time			0
' people with epilepsy may also have involuntary facial or hand movements , as @entity0 did , which indicate the electrical discharge has spread to an area of the brain involved in movement			1
epilepsy does not tend to worsen over time but , if left untreated , the continued , unexplained seizures can fuel further anxiety , which may make the seizures worse			2
' generally , if people are not diagnosed , that causes anxiety and depression and increases stress levels , which may make seizures more frequent and more serious , ' says dr @entity67			2
' whether stress itself causes seizures is controversial , but it 's likely that , in some individuals , it may be a trigger - perhaps because stress leads to other triggers , such as alcohol and sleep deprivation			1
' @entity0 was relieved to finally find out what was wrong with her - but the diagnosis was frightening			1
' it never occurred to me that i might have epilepsy			0
being told was like being told i was going to die			0
' the thought of all the seizures i 'd had in public - on buses , at school meetings - was humiliating			1
' it took several months for @entity0 's psychological and neurological symptoms to become untangled			1
even after being diagnosed with epilepsy , one neurologist thought she was experiencing non-epileptic seizures as well - seizures that are believed to have a psychological basis and are not caused by disrupted electrical brain activity			1
these seizures account for up to 30 per cent of people referred to epilepsy clinics			2
after her diagnosis , @entity0 was given antidepressants - which can sometimes help with non-epileptic seizures - along with anti-epileptic medication , which works by changing levels of chemicals in the brain that conduct electrical impulses			1
' the side - effects of these drugs were horrible			2
it was like a 24 - hour hangover , ' she says			2
' and i was still having seizures			2
' because of the seizures , she had to give up her driving licence			2
however , things started to look up when , in 2012 , she was referred to dr @entity67			0
her medication was switched to lamotrigine - a different anti-epileptic drug			2
and two years ago , the seizures stopped			2
' it was a huge relief , ' says @entity0			1
' i could still have one tomorrow , but i used to dread waking up in the morning			0
now i can live a normal life again			0

@entity0 , 43 , from @entity1 , thought she was suffering panic attacks
mother - of - two was prescribed antidepressants and tried talking therapies
nothing helped because she was actually suffering from epileptic seizures
