it comes in a remarkable testimony from former croupier @entity21 , who claims to be one of the last people to have seen @entity4 before he vanished , and who has finally broken his silence on the tragic events of november 7 , 1974			1

i was ten minutes into it when i was asked to come down and set up a private blackjack table			2
@entity4 came to the table with four £ 1,000 blue plaques which i would exchange for £ 25 chips as and when he required			1
bad loser : notorious gambler @entity4 with fellow card players at a @entity76 club @entity4 slammed his fists down on the table the night he lost twice his annual salary ‘ i took that £ 4,000 off him pretty quickly , maybe 30 to 35 minutes			1
’ mr @entity33 remembered @entity4 going to the cash desk and returning with another £ 4,000			1
‘ this time , i took the money off him even quicker – inside 25 minutes			2
at the end , he was down to his last £ 25 chip			2
‘ he looked at me , waiting for the deal			2
i politely reminded him of the terms of the game – minimum two hands ; minimum £ 25 stake on each			2

he stormed out and that was the last we saw of him			0
’ mr @entity33 said he never told his story at the time out of a sense of loyalty to his employers at the casino , and also because he feared his account would never be believed in the face of what he insists was an @entity115 cover - up			0
he eventually gave a statement to a metropolitan police officer by telephone earlier this year , following claims that @entity4 was living secretly in @entity120			1
old friend : casino owner @entity122 , who died in 2000 , is said by @entity123 to be among those who kept @entity4 's whereabouts hidden for years mystery : sir @entity127 , a businessman friend of @entity4 also incriminated in the plot , is pictured with the disgraced peer before his disappearance in 1974 after the nanny was killed and @entity17 attacked , @entity4 fled in a @entity132 borrowed from one of his gambling friends			1
