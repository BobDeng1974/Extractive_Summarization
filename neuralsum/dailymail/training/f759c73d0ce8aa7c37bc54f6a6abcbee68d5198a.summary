@entity2 's latest policy goes against its ethos of protecting those who suffer from abuse , the writer says since its foundation more than 50 years ago , @entity8 has gained a formidable reputation as a global campaigner against oppression			1
to people living under authoritarian rule , the organisation has rightly come to be seen as a symbol of hope and a force for freedom			2
as a left - leaning feminist , i have strongly supported @entity2 ’s efforts to promote the human rights of women around the world			1
but it is precisely because of this admiration that i am so dismayed by this new initiative , which runs counter to its entire ethos as a bulwark for people suffering abuse , exploitation and maltreatment			1
the call for the decriminalisation of prostitution or what it describes , with offensive understatement , as the ‘ sex work ’ industry is dressed up in soothing , politically correct rhetoric about women ’s rights			2
but the reality is that legalisation would represent official state approval of those who keep this vile trade going			2
the astonishing proposal shows absolutely no understanding of the dark , misogynistic world of prostitution , where coercion is rife and brutality endemic			0
@entity2 tries to pretend that women selling their bodies is similar to other forms of labour – with one passage in the document explicitly drawing a parallel between women who ‘ choose to become sex workers ’ and ‘ miners and domestic foreign workers ’			1
having researched prostitution , one woman who i interviewed described her life of seeing at least ten male customers a day as ‘ a form of torture ’			0
that is just the sort of injustice that @entity2 is meant to be fighting			1
yet @entity2 , in an abject inversion of its ethical values , has somehow persuaded itself that surrender to money - driven , masculine sexual aggression represents progress towards liberty			1
far from representing any form of advancement for women , the decriminalisation of prostitution would lead to more abuse , more violence , more subjugation			2
this was made clear in @entity91 where legalisation of the brothel industry in one state resulted in a fourfold increase in the number of trafficked women working in legal brothels			0
in a dreadful euphemism , @entity2 admits that ‘ the context ’ of the sex work industry is ‘ imperfect ’			1
‘ @entity109 ’ is one way of describing a trade built on physical abuse , rape , child sex abuse , sadism and greed			2
it is highly offensive of @entity2 to pretend that this is similar to other industries			1
in what other job do the occupational hazards include beatings , theft of earnings , sexually transmitted diseases , unwanted pregnancies , forcible removal of children , constant threats and even death ? in fact , there can be few more dangerous activities for women			0
it is telling that many of @entity130 ’s worst serial killers , like the @entity131 or the @entity133 killer @entity132 , regularly visited prostitutes			0
@entity135 , 19 , was one of the women killed by @entity132 in @entity133 in the same self - deceiving vein , @entity2 claims it will not support decriminalisation of prostitution where violence or coercion are involved			1
but that is just more confused thinking			0
intimidation is at the very core of this world			0
very few women end up selling sex through their own free choice			0
trafficking , menaces , drug addiction and financial pressures all play their part			0
recent research has shown that 67 per cent of prostitutes have suffered violence in childhood , 61 per cent had experienced violence from ‘ clients ’ and 74 per cent had endured mental and physical health problems as a result of their involvement with this trade			0
absurdly , @entity2 seems even to have accepted the notion that paying for sexual services is a basic human right for men			1
by definition , men who are willing to pay for sex already have a contemptuous attitude towards women – they are not interested in an equal relationship , or a meaningful exchange with a partner			0
instead of proposing legalisation , @entity8 should concentrate on freeing women from the clutches of these men			0
the end of prostitution might be a distant ideal , but it is still far better than @entity2 ’s grubby collusion with misogyny .			1
