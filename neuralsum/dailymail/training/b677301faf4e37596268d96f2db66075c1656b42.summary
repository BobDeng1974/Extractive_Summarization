by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 would be the first to admit there were times in his career as a footballer when he was utterly dislikeable			1
he was talented , of course , the success he enjoyed in tandem with @entity9 at @entity10 earning him the @entity12 ’s young player of the year award in 2002			2
but @entity9 also found him irritating — extremely irritating			2
in fairness to @entity14 , he was n’t too fond of himself either at times , to the point — as he said in his quite brilliant autobiography where he struggled to watch a recording of himself playing football			1
‘ i hate it , ’ he says			2
‘ i hate watching how i confront the referee			2
i do n’t like that side of me			2
’ game over : @entity25 forward has announced his retirement from football aged 34 fans ' favourite : @entity14 , pictured here playing for @entity30 against @entity31 , represented his country on 78 occasions danger man : @entity14 celebrates scoring against @entity35 for @entity36 in october , 2009 in a senior career that spanned 18 years and nine clubs , among them @entity36 , @entity41 , @entity42 and his beloved @entity25 , controversy was too often his companion			1
when he tells the story of attacking @entity47 with an eight iron , he sounds like @entity49 in @entity50 ; @entity51 rather curiously also being the title of @entity14 ’s book			1
it was , he concedes , the behaviour of a ‘ madman ’ , someone who rather disturbingly concluded that he had been ‘ disrespected ’ in front of his team - mates because @entity47 responded to persistent requests to sing a song one night during a training camp in @entity60 by losing his rag and saying no. there was no insult			2
the @entity66 said he had ‘ simply had enough ’ of @entity14 ‘ banging on about it ’			1
@entity14 stopped short of pulling out a revolver and shooting @entity47 there and then			1
but he did go to his room later that evening and whack him with the golf club before issuing a few threats of what might also be coming his way should he complain to the @entity41 management			1
@entity14 at least deserves credit for the honest account he provides of the incident , coupled with the following admission : ‘ i look back at what i did now and i cringe			1
it was drunken , bullying behaviour			0
’ with the help of @entity90 , the much - respected sports psychiatrist , the combustible @entity14 has worked hard to reform			1
but beyond focusing on the fall - outs and football , on the 135 goals he scored in 452 league appearances , we should perhaps trust the judgment of those who know @entity14 best			1
back of the net : @entity14 scores one of his 169 career goals for @entity10 against @entity104 dream come true : @entity14 shows off his @entity25 shirt after signing for the @entity109 side on loan in august , 2010 back again : @entity14 enjoyed two spells at @entity41 during his 18 years as a professional @entity114 ( 1996 - 00 ) 91 @entity115 ( 2000 - 01 ) 39 @entity116 ( 2001 - 05 ) 128 @entity117 ( loan , 2005 ) 15 @entity119 ( 2005 - 06 ) 32 @entity120 ( 2006 - 07 ) 41 @entity121 ( 2007 - 09 ) 26 @entity122 ( 2009 - 11 ) 51 @entity123 ( loan , 2010 - 11 ) 35 @entity125 ( 2011 - 12 ) 33 @entity126 ( 2012 - 14 ) 52 @entity127 169 @entity128 78 19 you can certainly judge a man by the company he keeps and among his best friends in football are @entity134 and @entity135			1
and few players were as close as @entity14 to the late @entity137 , as classy a man as you could wish to meet in football			1
@entity134 , together with @entity140 , wrote the foreword to @entity14 ’s book			1
on hearing that @entity14 was joining @entity41 in 2006 , @entity134 said he was expecting a ‘ bit of a hothead ’ and ‘ someone who was more interested in being a footballer rather than actually living like one ’			1
but @entity134 ’s view changed once he got to know @entity14			1
‘ i was totally wrong , ’ he admitted			0
‘ it surprised me how professional he was and how much he loved the game			0
he ended up being a terrific ally for me at @entity41 as well as becoming a good friend			1
’ the sentiment is echoed by @entity135			0
‘ he is right up there with the best @entity109 players of his generation and beyond , ’ @entity135 wrote in these pages			0
‘ he expects the highest standards from those around him and certainly is n’t afraid to say if he feels someone has fallen short			0
‘ he had problems with certain players and managers during his career because of his character but i loved him			2
’ @entity14 loved @entity137 , and the death of the @entity30 manager had a profound effect on him			1
it made him re-evaluate his life and seek the help of @entity90 , a man he credits with making him the person he is , someone who feels equipped to pursue a career in management			1
experienced : @entity14 celebrates scoring for @entity179 against @entity180 at the 2012 @entity181 early days : @entity14 , pictured here tussling with @entity183 's @entity182 , joined @entity184 in 2000 in the swing : @entity14 celebrates a goal for @entity41 against @entity187 with a golf - themed celebration in 2007 ‘ when i started talking to @entity90 in the aftermath of @entity191 ’s death , i thought my life was n’t going to get better when i finished playing football			1
my life was going to be dark			2
‘ if i had n’t started seeing @entity90 , if i had n’t begun to change , my people skills — or lack of them — would have destroyed my chances of being a successful manager			1
’ on the last page of his book , he writes of how @entity137 ’s death forced him to look at himself			0
‘ if i had n’t done that , i do n’t know what would have happened , ’ he says			0
most moving , however , are the final few lines			0
‘ i think differently now , ’ he says			0
‘ be thankful for what you ’ve done			0
and do n’t ruin your life			2
i did that for too long			0
’ even now , there are episodes that will make him reflect and cringe			0
but he should listen to his peers and , indeed , be thankful for what he did on a football pitch			0
on @entity137 's death ' @entity219 was my idol			0
he was everything i tried to become			0
the tears started to fall			0
i knew it was real then			0
' on his anger issues ' people say " if you take the anger out of @entity14 he would n’t be half the player "			1
it ’s b * * * * * * *			0
' on investing £ 1.4million in his @entity235 foundation ' i wanted to give them an opportunity in life , not just in football			2
i wanted to do something for the country			0
' on attacking @entity47 ' i just whacked him across the backside with the golf club			0
you could n’t call it a swing			0
