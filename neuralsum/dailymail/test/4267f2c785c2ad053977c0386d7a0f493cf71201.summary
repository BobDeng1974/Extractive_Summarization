he now says he needs to make adaptations to his home in @entity8 , @entity9 , right but after he and his wife @entity18 , who have an eight - year - old daughter called @entity27 , tried to claim for financial support to adapt their semi-detached home as they have no bathroom downstairs , they were told they were n't eligible			1

mrs @entity41 , a credit manager for a tool hire firm who earns between £ 25,000 and £ 35,000 , said : ' it 's crazy			0
i understand that benefits need to be means tested and i agree with that			0
' but it 's not as if we are after ongoing weekly benefits - just funding to help us create a safe and comfortable home for my husband , who has suffered massively through no fault of his own			0
mr @entity7 and his wife were told that because they do n't claim any income support or benefits , they would have to earn ' virtually nothing ' to receive the grant ' if i gave up work we could claim for everything and would be entitled to everything , but because i work and would like to continue to work , we get no help			1
' we 're having to rely on my salary alone to support two adults and a child			0

' the couple are wanting to adapt their home to incorporate a downstairs bedroom and bathroom			1
but they say because they are unable to do this , it is placing a strain on the family			0
mrs @entity41 added : ' we live in a normal semi-detached house			2
we do n't have a bathroom or bedroom downstairs and my husband will be expected to spend all of his time in the family living room with very little dignity or privacy			1
' mr @entity7 , a former construction worker , became wheelchair bound after doctors failed to spot a tumour in his spinal column , despite him regularly visiting his gp at @entity102 complaining of pain			1
he was referred to hospital for a cat scan when only an mri scan would have picked up the growth , caused by a build up of spinal fluid , which stretched half the length of his spine			0
eventually the tumour was detected after he was finally sent for an mri scan in july 2014 , when complaining that while running he felt as though he could n't lift his feet off the ground			1
he then underwent a 10 - hour operation to remove the tumour as surgeons described his diagnosis as a ' ticking time bomb '			2
but due to existing nerve damage and the trauma of the operation , he has been left paralysed from the waist down with doctors unable to say if he will ever walk again			2
