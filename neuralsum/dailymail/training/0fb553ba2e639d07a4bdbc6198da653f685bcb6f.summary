deaths from some of the most common cancers have dropped by a third in the last 20 years , the latest figures show			1
rates of death caused by breast , bowel , lung and prostate cancer combined fell by 30 per cent overall , according to @entity12			1
these cancers account for almost half of the 160,000 cancer deaths in the @entity16 each year			1
the charity says research , leading to innovative drugs and other forms of treatment , is responsible for more patients beating the disease			1
@entity12 's latest study shows death rates from the most common forms of cancer have fallen earlier diagnosis has helped boost survival rates , but there have also been major advances in surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
death rates for breast cancer fell by 38 per cent , bowel cancer by 34 per cent , lung cancer by 27 per cent and prostate cancer by 21 per cent in 2010 - 2012 compared with 1991 - 1993			1
the data shows around 15,000 people died from breast cancer 20 years ago compared with 11,600 now			1
scientists have improved detection of the disease through screening and more effective treatments - such as more effective forms of surgery and radiotherapy , along with hormonal drugs			2
today almost 3,000 fewer people a year die from bowel cancer than 20 years ago , while recently introduced screening is likely to bring death rates down further through earlier diagnosis			1
but a fall of 3,000 lung cancer deaths over the last two decades has masked rising rates among women smokers			1
prostate cancer survival in the @entity16 has doubled in the last 40 years with half of those diagnosed with cancer living for at least 10 years			2
but some cancers have not made the same progress , with death rates in liver , pancreatic , melanoma , oral and some digestive cancers all increasing			1
despite improvements , cancer survival rates in @entity16 still lag well behind those in other @entity75 countries			2
a major study of 29 countries found that the @entity16 was on a par with @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 far below @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
@entity85 , @entity12 ’s chief executive , said ‘ research continues to help save lives from cancer , and these figures offer renewed encouragement that progress continues			1
‘ the @entity16 remains a world leader in cancer research , responsible for many of the breakthroughs that have reduced the impact of cancer			2
@entity85 , chief executive of @entity12 , said @entity16 was a ' world leader ' in cancer research ‘ but while the death rate for the four biggest cancer killers falls , it ’s vital to remember that more needs to be done to help bring even better results over the coming years			1
‘ there are over 200 different forms of the disease			0
for some of these , the advances are less impressive , such as pancreatic , oesophageal and liver cancer			0
‘ far too many lives continue to be affected by the disease			0
we ’re determined that the research we fund will help save more lives , developing better , kinder treatments which will beat cancer sooner			0
’ mother of two @entity122 from @entity123 was just 31 when she was diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer in 2012			0
she had intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy to shrink the tumour , a 12 hour operation to remove it and then a further course of chemo finally finishing on christmas eve 2012			0
@entity122 ’s mother had died from bowel cancer three years earlier after enduring six years of gruelling treatment – which the young mother was dreading			2
‘ i expected the worst but almost everything about the treatment had changed ’ she said			2
‘ you could just see how much it had improved from when i went through it with mum			0
while my mother had chemo in the hospital i could take a pill at home			0
‘ the difference in how cancer care and treatment had moved on in 10 years was phenomenal – thanks to research i ’m incredibly optimistic that in another 10 years things will have got even better			0
‘ soon after my mother was diagnosed , my grandmother realised she ’d been having similar symptoms and she too was diagnosed with bowel cancer			0
‘ but unfortunately it was too late for treatment and she died aged 69			0
when i was referred for genetic counselling i discovered my great grandfather had died from the same thing making four generations affected by the same cancer			0

death rates of some of the most common cancers have dropped by a third
*significant* reductions in deaths from breast , lung and prostate cancers
@entity12 says new drugs and treatment is responsible for drop
