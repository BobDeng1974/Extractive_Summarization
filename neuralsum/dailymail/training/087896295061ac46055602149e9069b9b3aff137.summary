' when you start living in that world , and doing that , you start , i guess , feeling raped			0
’ the actress , who hours earlier had been photographed leaving @entity31 ’s hotel in @entity32 with her adopted son @entity33 , two , and her partner , fellow oscar - winner @entity35 , 53 , was then pushed on whether she really felt invasions of her privacy were equivalent to sexual violence			1

’ ( @entity80 ) 2008 : tells @entity83 : ‘ i ’m a sexual creature			1
there ’s nothing wrong with that			0

@entity130 , chief executive of victim support charity @entity131 , which runs the @entity132 , said : ‘ there ’s one thing that ’s like rape and that ’s rape			1
' it weakens what we understand as rape when we use that word inappropriately			1
it cheapens the aftermath of rape and it cheapens [ victims ’ ] suffering			1
‘ if @entity1 spent an afternoon listening to a rape crisis helpline she would understand very quickly that unwanted press attention is very different			2
’ @entity148 from @entity149 added that miss @entity1 had no excuse for making comments that would ‘ upset people who have survived attacks ’			2
she said : ‘ it is always disappointing when someone high profile uses that language and turns sexual violence into a metaphor for something else			1
‘ it is never appropriate and it trivialises the experience of sexual violence			1
‘ it ’s particularly disappointing in this case because @entity1 has campaigned against sexual violence before			1
’ miss @entity1 has been involved in several anti-rape campaigns , including appearing in a @entity7 advert in 1999 standing under a banner reading ‘ real men do n’t rape ’			2
