the federal government pays for a $ 15 million ' wool trust fund , ' runs a $ 170 million program to protect catfish growers from overseas competition , sets aside $ 3 million to promote @entity6 trees , funds another $ 2 million to help farmers sell more sheep , and plunks down $ 100 million researching how to get @entity9 to buy more maple syrup			1
and that spending is just three one - hundredths of one per cent of the @entity13 that president @entity14 signed friday in @entity15			1
@entity17 and conservative watchdogs alike are hopping mad at what they say are pork - barrel projects included in the five - year agriculture spending law as home - state perks to lawmakers that are unneeded or redundant			1
there 's a new 15 - cent levy on every live - cut christmas tree , a proposal that agriculture secretary @entity28 had blocked but will now be beyond his control			0
tree growers will put the money into a fund for ' industry - funded promotion , research , and information program [ s ] , ' but the cost will inevitably be passed on to consumers			0
a table made from a pork barrel ? @entity14 signed the nearly $ 1 trillion @entity13 in @entity15 on friday like maple syrup on your stack ? the feds will plunk down $ 100 million in the coming years to help the industry lure more breakfast eaters the @entity13 also includes $ 1 million in grant money to buy weather radios , despite the ubiquity of @entity49 and the plummeting costs of both internet service and smartphones			1
and it continues a $ 200 million ' market access ' program that has paid companies like @entity55 and @entity56 to run commercials			2
one grant from that fund even funded a reality tv show in @entity61 aimed at promoting cotton			0
another paid @entity64 's $ 844,000 to hawk grape juice outside the @entity9 the conservative @entity66 called the legislation , which took members of @entity69 three years to write , ' a " @entity75 " bill where there ’s a gift for practically every special interest group out there with a well - connected lobbyist			1
' it 's $ 956 billion of spending overall in a ten - year period , sketched out in legislation 959 pages long – nearly $ 1 billion per page			1
but most of that money goes to food - stamp and nutrition programs , which are administered by the @entity9 @entity85			1
the 10 - year spending total for those entitlements will hit $ 756 billion under the new law			2
get ready to pay more : christmas tree growers will put millions into a @entity13 - approved fund to hep them with marketing , with consumers likely footing the bill in the form of higher prices food stamp costs make up most of the @entity13 -- more than 80 per cent agriculture secretary @entity28 ( r ) had blocked the christmas tree tax in the past , but is now powerless to stop it that amount is $ 8.7 billion less than the previous @entity13 included , but trends suggest it may have to be revised			1
since president @entity14 took office , the number of @entity9 receiving those benefits has nearly doubled			1
one in five @entity9 households receive food stamps today			1
more than 1 million people were added to the rolls in 2013 , including residents who live in the country illegally			2
in the year 2000 the entire food stamp program cost $ 17 billion			2
last year that figure was $ 78 billion			2
the rest of the @entity13 , all $ 200 billion of it , includes some subsidy payments to members of @entity69 and their families who are engaged in agriculture			2
the left - leaning @entity121 reports that in 2013 , in 2013 , more than $ 237,000 was paid to federal lawmakers and their spouses			0
all but two were @entity125			0
still , @entity126 scuttled a bipartisan @entity128 amendment that would have required public disclosure of such payments			0
@entity133 @entity125 rep @entity131 and @entity135 @entity126 rep. @entity134 pushed the transparency tweak unsuccessfully last year			0
also on some watchdogs ' lists of @entity13 waste is an estimated $ 1 billion per year taxpayers lend out to protect the sugar industry against price fluctuations , shielding it – mostly in the form of just three companies – from being undercut by cheaper imported sugar			1
the result also raises sugar prices nationwide			0
how much in taxes ? baaaah ! the @entity9 sheep industry is thriving , but taxpayers will shell out $ 2 million to help ranchers sell even more back to @entity153 ! @entity14 signed the @entity13 in front of @entity156 tractors , representing the big agribusinesses that will largely benefit from the new spending law ' by keeping an unnecessary catfish inspection program and refusing to reform crop insurance or eliminate the unnecessary sugar program , members of both parties and both chambers missed a golden opportunity to fundamentally shift agriculture policy from government - centric to one that embraces the free market and common sense , ' said @entity171 , president of the @entity172			1
' and the left - leaning @entity173 is no more enamored with the final law			0
' the bill is a disaster for taxpayers and has the potential to be even more expensive and wasteful than the abysmal @entity181 that it is replacing , ' the group 's president , @entity175 , complained			0
@entity14 signed it into law at @entity184 alongside @entity15 @entity126 sen. @entity185			0
he called it a ' @entity188 knife , ' with something for everyone , including the catfish lobby			0
taxpayer lobby groups failed to cut that industry 's hand - out from the @entity13 , despite pointing out that there 's already a similar program funded by the @entity197 .			0

the *massive* five - years agriculture spending plan , signed friday by president @entity14 , includes a $ 3 million plan for @entity75 taxes
most of the bill covers food stamps , with the number of benefit *recipients* doubling since @entity14 took office
the @entity9 will spend $ 1 billion per year loaning money to sugar barons so they can keep prices stable and avoid overseas competition
another $ 100 million will go to study how to get @entity9 to buy more maple syrup
$ 1 million will buy weather radios for rural @entity9 , despite plunging hundreds of weather apps for smartphones and plunging access rates
