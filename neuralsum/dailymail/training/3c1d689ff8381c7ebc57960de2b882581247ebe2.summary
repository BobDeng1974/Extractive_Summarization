by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:39 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 04:52 est , 1 november 2012 the coalition risked descending into political infighting today , after @entity5 suffered his first significant commons defeat at the hands of @entity8 and @entity10 rebels demanding a tougher stance on the @entity13 ’s budget			1
@entity10 rebels claimed they had defied the prime minister to vote for the @entity17 people , while loyalists warned conservatives must ‘ get a grip ’ and support mr @entity5 or face defeat at the 20 - 15 general election			1
chancellor @entity23 refused to say a real - terms reduction in @entity26 spending was impossible but deputy prime minister @entity27 warned those demanding a cut had ‘ absolutely no hope ’ of achieving their goal			1
mps voted for a cut by 307 votes to 294 result : the result is announced to the @entity43 as mps watch on mr @entity5 will go to next month 's @entity49 summit calling for a real terms freeze in the @entity13 's seven - year budget			1
but @entity44 instead backed a call for a cut by 307 votes to 294			1
mr @entity5 has faced repeated comparisons to @entity55 , whose premiership was dominated by @entity10 splits over @entity58 and endless debates on the @entity60 which eroded his authority			1
@entity10 mp @entity62 warned mr @entity5 's hopes of winning the next election had been damaged by last night 's vote			1
' colleagues have got to realise that we 've got to get a grip and support the prime minister			0
' electors do not vote for parties that they see as being divided			2
i do not believe that the @entity10 should be putting itself in the position to lose the next general election , ' he told @entity76			1
the @entity15 yesterday indicated he would use @entity17 ’s veto unless @entity26 agreed to limit its budget increases to the level of inflation			1
but this did not satisfy the @entity82 in his party , who insist on a real - terms reduction			1
in the first major defeat of mr @entity5 ’s premiership , a total of 53 @entity10 backbenchers voted with @entity8 , which was accused of cynically shifting its position on @entity13 spending earlier this week to embarrass the prime minister			1
senior government figures had spent the day pleading with rebel @entity94 to accept that a real - terms budget freeze was the best possible outcome from a crunch @entity13 summit next week			1
today mr @entity23 sought to placate the rebels , saying he understood the ‘ frustration ’ of @entity44 over ‘ outrageous ’ rises in @entity13 spending			1
he declined to say whether he believed a real - terms cut was possible and played down the significance of last night 's vote as a ‘ debate about tactics ’			1
deputy pm @entity27 said those calling for a cut in the @entity13 budget had ' absolutely no hope ' of achieving their goal ‘ what we have got to do is come to a position that is agreed by the other countries and that the @entity43 accepts			1
that 's the circle we 've got to square , ’ mr @entity23 told @entity76			1
‘ what you saw last night was a debate about tactics , about the start of a negotiation , understandable frustration from mps on all sides of the @entity10 and the @entity43 that the @entity13 is spending too much			1
’ he also attacked @entity8 , claiming its tactics reminded him of the ‘ unprincipled ’ stances taken by conservatives in the wake of the @entity8 landslide in 1997			0
foreign secretary @entity130 earlier said ministers would ‘ hear and take notice ’ of what @entity132 had said			0
but deputy prime minister @entity27 aimed insisted the @entity136 ’s position remains the same			1
‘ we will not accept an increase , above inflation , to the @entity140			0
that is a real terms freeze			1
and we will protect the @entity17 rebate in full			0
that is the toughest position of any @entity58 country			0
’ in a speech to be delivered to the @entity147 international affairs think - tank , he also turned his fire on @entity8 , angrily accusing them of a ‘ dishonest ’ and ‘ hypocritical ’ change of policy for short - term political advantage			2
‘ in pushing a completely unrealistic position on the @entity13 budget - one that is miles away from any other country 's position - labour would have absolutely no hope of getting a budget deal agreed			1
’ ministers insist there is no chance of persuading all other 26 @entity13 member states to accept a real - terms cut in spending , since 17 of them get more out of @entity26 spending than they put in			1
however , they believe that with most governments being forced to tighten their belts at home in an age of austerity , there is scope for an agreement on a freeze			0
at prime minister 's questions yesterday , mr @entity5 told mps : ‘ this government is taking the toughest line in these budget negotiations of any government since we joined the @entity13			2
‘ at best we would like it cut , at worst frozen , and i ’m quite prepared to use the veto if we do n’t get a deal which is good for @entity17			2
but let ’s be clear – it is in our interest to try to get a deal because a seven - year freeze would keep our bills down compared to annual budgets			2
’ if mr @entity5 does wield @entity17 ’s veto , no deal will be reached – and under the @entity13 ’s rules , the current year ’s budget is rolled forward , plus inflation			0
annual budgets can be agreed by a majority of member states , rather than the unanimity required for a longer seven - year agreement			1
but last night ’s vote will increase the pressure on the prime minister , who last year became the first to deploy the veto when he refused to sign up to a treaty on ‘ fiscal union ’ , to repeat the exercise at a summit next month			2
@entity211 financial secretary to the treasury @entity212 said in yesterday 's debate : ‘ we want to see the @entity13 budget cut			2
part of the negotiating mandate that the prime minister has agreed is that the very most that we would accept would be a real - terms freeze			1
‘ if there is no cut or no real freeze , there is no deal			1
the framework will be vetoed			0
the prime minister has a formidable task in persuading other countries of this , many of whom were looking forward to a seven - year payout			1
’ rebel @entity234 said : ‘ this is not about @entity10 divisions or @entity8 hypocrisy , it ’s the moment the @entity43 finally said , “ enough is enough ”			1
enough to the @entity240 elite and the @entity241			0
we will not put up with it any more			0
’ @entity243 , another @entity82 mp , hailed what he called a ‘ remarkable victory ’			0
‘ @entity132 spoke for the people , ’ he said			2
‘ there was enormous pressure on colleagues to vote with the government			2
it was a very significant victory for the people			0
it was because mps have to face their constituents			0
’ there were bizarre scenes in the @entity39 as backbench @entity94 clashed with each other and with @entity8 members			2
veteran mp @entity258 compared his colleague sir @entity62 to wartime prime minister @entity260 , who was accused of selling out to @entity261 , after sir @entity62 warned it would be an act of supreme ‘ self - indulgence ’ to defy the prime minister			0
remarkable victory : @entity243 , left , said that the defeat was the day @entity132 spoke for the people while @entity234 added that it was the moment the @entity43 said ' enough is enough ' sir @entity62 denounced claims by the rebels that defeat strengthens mr @entity5 ’s position at next month ’s summit as ‘ cobblers ’			2
he warned that failure to back mr @entity5 would cause the @entity94 to lose the next election			0
‘ if colleagues are not prepared to support the prime minister , every time they go into a division lobby different from that of the prime minister , they are weakening the prime minister ’s negotiating hand in @entity58 , ’ he said			0
abstained : senior right - wingers such as former defence secretary chose not to vote rather than side with @entity8 ‘ we simply can not carry on with this sort of self - indulgence			2
if this party hopes to be in government after the next general election , it has just got to get a grip and start supporting the prime minister			2
’ @entity8 ’s @entity300 spokesman @entity299 , meanwhile , was jeered by @entity94 who accused @entity8 , which gave away a huge chunk of @entity17 ’s budget rebate and waved through inflationary increases while in power , of a cynical stunt			0
mr @entity299 repeatedly refused to say whether @entity8 would use a budget veto , though his fellow @entity300 frontbencher @entity308 had earlier suggested the party might			0
mr @entity299 said : ‘ a real - terms reduction is possible but it requires persuasive diplomacy , careful alliance building and , above all , leadership			1
’ senior right - wingers such as former defence secretary @entity314 abstained rather than vote on the same side as @entity8			2
but in a hard - hitting speech yesterday dr @entity314 warned mr @entity5 that he must threaten to leave the @entity13 or he ‘ can not achieve ’ his pledge to renegotiate the @entity17 ’s relationship with @entity26			1
‘ if you ’re not willing to cross the @entity322 on that point you can not achieve what we ’re trying to achieve , ’ he told the @entity320			0
dr @entity314 said the @entity94 should enter the next election on a pledge to go ‘ back to the @entity328 ’ , stressing economic not political links with @entity58 and then offer a referendum on the new deal or exit			0
a source close to the prime minister said : ‘ we were expecting to lose this vote			0
everyone agrees we want to keep down @entity13 spending			0
the only difference is how you do that			0
‘ the prime minister has made it very clear that a cut is the best case scenario and a freeze is the worst case scenario			0
he will keep fighting to get the best deal for taxpayers			0
@entity5 is the only prime minister in history to use the veto and our backbenchers understand that			0
@entity132 is absolutely right to express its view			0
it ’s a “ take note ” motion and we will take note			0

government loses crunch vote by 307 votes to 294 as @entity39 demands a real terms cut in funding for @entity26
@entity27 says there is ' absolutely no chance ' of persuading all 26 states for a real - terms cut
@entity23 says he understands the ' frustration ' of backbenchers
rebels say they have spoken for the people but loyalists warn @entity10 hopes of *re-election* have been damaged by the *revolt*
