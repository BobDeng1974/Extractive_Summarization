by @entity0 our large brains , long legs and ability to craft tools are often thought to have evolved together at the start of the @entity8 lineage up to 2.4 million years ago			1
but new climate and fossil evidence shows these unique traits may have originated much earlier in our @entity14 ancestors , between three and four million years ago			1
the research also suggests that rather than forming as a single package , these key traits evolved individually , over a much longer timeframe			1
our large brains , long legs and ability to craft tools were thought to have evolved together at the start of the @entity8 lineage ( illustration pictured left ) up to 2.4 million years ago			1
new climate and fossil evidence shows these traits may have originated earlier , in @entity14 ancestors ( pictured right ) , 4 million years ago although scientists have recognised these characteristics for decades , they are now reconsidering the true evolutionary factors that drove them			1
paleoanthropologist dr @entity31 began by developing a climate framework for @entity33 2.5 million to 1.5 million years ago			2
this showed that the era was a time of strong climate instability and shifting intensity of annual wet and dry seasons			0
researchers then reviewed the body of fossil evidence relevant to the origin of @entity8 , to understand how the human genus evolved			1
species ' can be identified based on differences in the shape of their skulls , especially their face and jaws , but not on the basis of size			0
these differences in their skulls suggest early @entity8 spread across the the environment , each utilising a slightly different strategy to survive			0
even though all @entity8 species had overlapping body , brain and tooth sizes , they also had larger brains and bodies than their likely ancestors , @entity14			1
according to the study , these differences and similarities show the human package of traits evolved separately , and at different times in the past rather than all together			2
it also blurs the lines as to when the traits began to evolve			0
a large brain , long legs , the ability to craft tools and prolonged maturation periods were all thought to have evolved as @entity33 grasslands expanded and @entity81 ’s climate became cooler and drier			1
the new analysis , published in the journal @entity84 , led the team to conclude that the ability of early humans to adjust to changing conditions ultimately enabled the earliest species of @entity8 to vary , survive , and begin spreading from @entity33 to @entity90 1.85 million years ago			1
paleoanthropologist dr @entity31 began by developing a climate framework for @entity33 2.5 million to 1.5 million years ago			2
this showed that the era was a time of strong climate instability and shifting intensity of annual wet and dry seasons			0
the framework , which is based on @entity81 ’s astronomical cycles , provides the basis for some of the paper ’s key findings , and it suggests that multiple coexisting species of @entity8 that overlapped geographically emerged in highly changing environments			1
dr @entity31 , curator of anthropology and director of the @entity109 at the @entity111 ’s @entity110 , said : ‘ unstable climate conditions favoured the evolution of the roots of human flexibility in our ancestors			2
‘ the narrative of human evolution that arises from our analyses stresses the importance of adaptability to changing environments , rather than adaptation to any one environment , in the early success of the genus @entity8			0
’ between 2.1 and 1.8 million years ago , the oldest species of @entity8 ( pictured left and second from left ) began to diversify			2
by 1.8 to 1.9 million years ago , @entity130 ( fossils pictured right and second from right ) evolved in @entity33 and began spreading to @entity90			0
these lineages overlapped for several hundred thousand years even though all @entity8 species had overlapping body , brain and tooth sizes , they had larger brains and bodies than the @entity14			1
these differences and similarities show the human package of traits evolved separately , and at different times			0
this graphic shows the overlapping species the researchers then reviewed the entire body of fossil evidence relevant to the origin of @entity8 to better understand how the human genus evolved			1
@entity152 , professor of anthropology at @entity154 , said : ‘ we can tell the species apart based on differences in the shape of their skulls , especially their face and jaws , but not on the basis of size			0
‘ the differences in their skulls suggest early @entity8 divvied up the environment , each utilising a slightly different strategy to survive			0
’ even though all of the @entity8 species had overlapping body , brain and tooth sizes , they also had larger brains and bodies than the @entity14			1
the morphology , variation and behaviour of our ancestors is pictured			0
in addition to studying climate and fossil data , the team also reviewed evidence from ancient stone tools , isotopes found in teeth and cut marks found on animal bones in @entity33 according to the study , these differences and similarities show that the human package of traits evolved separately , and at different times			1

@entity204 , president of the @entity205 , added : ‘ taken together , these data suggest that species of early @entity8 were more flexible in their dietary choices than other species			0
' the team concluded that this flexibility likely enhanced the ability of human ancestors to successfully adapt to unstable environments and disperse from @entity33			2
dr @entity31 said : ‘ this flexibility continues to be a hallmark of human biology today , and one that ultimately underpins the ability to occupy diverse habitats throughout the world			0
’ he said future research on new fossil and archaeological finds will need to focus on identifying specific adaptive features that originated with early @entity8 , which will yield a deeper understanding of human evolution .			0

@entity8 ’s large brains , long legs and the ability to craft tools are often thought to have evolved together at the start of the @entity8 lineage
this was when @entity33 grasslands expanded and climate became drier
but , fossil evidence suggests these traits did *n't* arise as a single package
@entity81 ’s astronomical cycles suggests multiple species of @entity8 overlapped
traits said to have developed later have been spotted in earlier ancestors
this means our links with @entity14 , for example , may have started sooner than first thought
