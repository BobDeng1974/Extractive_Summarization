almost 1,000 students from mainland @entity2 falsely claimed more than £ 5million in taxpayer - funded loans and grants amid lax controls on private colleges , spending watchdogs revealed today			1
the students – mainly from @entity8 and @entity9 – were handed nearly £ 5,500 each on average to study in @entity11 after officials failed to make proper residence checks			1
the revelation prompted accusations that the @entity16 had presided over an ‘ incredible ’ misuse of public funds after failing to control a huge expansion in private providers of higher education			1
almost 1,000 students from mainland @entity2 falsely claimed more than £ 5million in taxpayer - funded loans and grants amid lax controls on private colleges , spending watchdogs revealed today ministers allowed private colleges greater access to public money in the form of loans for tuition fees and living costs but failed to prevent taxpayers ’ money being used for ‘ private gain ’ , it is claimed			1
some colleges were found to be recruiting students with ‘ limited ’ @entity39 and barely any checks of capability or motivation			1
there are suspicions that , once tuition fees had been paid to the college and student loans or grants paid to the student , large numbers simply dropped out of their courses			1
drop - out rates at some private colleges were found to be running at 20 per cent			2
some colleges have been dubbed the ‘ cashpoint ’ by students because they gave them easy access to student finance			1
critical : @entity61 mp @entity60 has called the £ 5.4 million agreed in loans to ineligible students ‘ incredible ’ one - the @entity64 , which is located above a tile depot in @entity66 , north @entity67 and was highlighted by whistle - blowers earlier this year – was found to have 273 ‘ potentially ineligible applicants ’ for financial support , 36 of whom had already been paid before stricter checks were introduced			1
details of the wrongful payments to overseas students emerged today in a report by the @entity77			0
suspicions the system was being abused were first raised by a surge in applications for financial help with living costs from @entity85 nationals , many from @entity8			2
it also emerged that more than 80 per cent of new students at some providers were of @entity8 or @entity9 origin			1
further concerns were sparked by bulk applications from the same internet location – in some cases 50 per day			0
until september last year , the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) relied mainly on the word of students that they had lived in the @entity11 for three years needed – the residence criteria for help with living costs			0
an emergency review of more than 11,000 applications found that half – 5,548 – were potentially false			0
these applicants could or would not provide proof - such as bank statements , payslips or utility bills – of three years ’ residence			0
of these , 992 of those had already been handed the money they applied for			0
as of the middle of november , only £ 350,000 of the £ 5.4 million had been recovered by @entity95 , the @entity77 said			0
of the potentially ineligible claims , 84 per cent came from students registered for courses at just 16 alternative providers			0
in its report , the @entity77 also drew attention to high drop - out rates at nine alternative providers			0
at these colleges , one in five students dropped out part - way through the year – five times the average for higher education			2
but @entity128 had not set any threshold for what was an acceptable rate where students are receiving support from public funds , it noted			1
in further findings , the said that up to 20 per cent of students at alternative providers may not even have been registered for a qualification with an awarding body			0
following @entity142 reforms , students at alternative providers – which are mainly for - profit private colleges – are allowed to claim maintenance loans and grants worth up to £ 11,000 - a - year			2
@entity145 , general secretary of the @entity146 , believes it has taken far too long for the issue to be addressed colleges themselves can be handed £ 6,000 in tuition fees for each student they enrol			1
the shake - up was aimed at driving up standards and challenging existing universities by increasing competition			0
between 2010/11 and 2013/14 , the number of students from @entity85 member states claiming public money to study at alternative providers ballooned from 7,000 to 53,000 , with the associated bill rising from £ 50million to £ 675million			2
officials from @entity128 , @entity95 and the @entity165 face a grilling by mps over the problems later this month			0
the chair of the @entity170 , @entity61 mp @entity60 , said the expansion had been allowed without proper safeguards against abuse , branding the £ 5.4 million agreed in loans to ineligible students ‘ incredible ’			1
‘ @entity176 went ahead with its reforms to expand the role of private colleges without ensuring there were controls in place to ensure that taxpayers ’ money was used for its intended purpose of supporting higher education and not for private gain , ’ she said			2
‘ this extraordinary rate of expansion , high drop - out rates , and warnings from within the sector ought to have set alarm bells ringing			0
‘ as @entity16 hands more and more taxpayers ’ money to private companies and institutions to deliver services for the public good , we have to be able to follow the taxpayers ’ pound wherever it is spent			2
’ @entity145 , general secretary of the @entity146 , said : ‘ while we are pleased the misuse of public funds is finally being brought to light , we remain angry that it took so long to happen			1
we raised the issues of for - profit colleges ’ access to taxpayers ’ money time and again with ministers , but we were ignored at every turn			0
