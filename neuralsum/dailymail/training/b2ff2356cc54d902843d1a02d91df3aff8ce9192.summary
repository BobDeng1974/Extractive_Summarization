the education watchdog was yesterday accused of risking children ’s safety by ditching plans for routine snap inspections of schools			1
sir @entity6 provoked fury among supporters of former education secretary @entity9 after rejecting demands for @entity11 to stop giving schools notice of visits by its inspectors			1
this is the second occasion on which current education secretary @entity19 ’s administration appears to have backtracked on a policy of her predecessor			1
sir @entity6 has been criticised by supporters of @entity9 for abandoning no - notice inspections mr @entity9 and @entity24 publicly backed a move to unannounced visits for all schools following the ‘ @entity35 ’ revelations that @entity30 extremists had tried to infiltrate governing bodies at a string of @entity34 schools			1
some schools were said to have put on ‘ hastily arranged shows of cultural inclusivity ’ such as lessons on @entity40 after receiving notice that inspectors were poised to visit			0
but sir @entity9 , the chief inspector , insisted yesterday he did ‘ not need ’ to introduce routine no - notice inspections for all schools but that they would still be conducted in specific schools if @entity11 received reports of declining standards			1
now @entity48 , a former special adviser to mr @entity9 , has accused sir @entity9 of bowing to pressure from teaching unions which had bitterly resisted the move to routine snap inspections			1
‘ it ’s bad news for parents that @entity11 and the government have caved in to the unions , ’ he told the @entity53			2
‘ there are big problems with schools cheating inspections to hide bad behaviour and bad teaching			0
in other fields involving safety , it is basic that inspections should be no notice so that transparency catches mistakes			0
‘ now , schools that get the best marks are often the ones who put on the best show – not ones that teach best			0
this surrender will mean lower standards and puts children at risk			0
’ education secretary @entity19 , left , has abandoned two of her predecessor @entity9 's policies , right the revelation that most schools will continue to receive notice of @entity11 visits came as part of a wider shake - up of the inspection system in @entity91			1
schools now face inspections every three years instead of every five as at present , even though , sir @entity9 admitted , school performance can decline ‘ very quickly ’ in a matter of months			2
sir @entity9 said he had considered calls for routine no - notice inspections , but ‘ after much thought and deliberation ’ had decided against them			2
heads are currently told of an impending inspection about half a day in advance			0
sir @entity9 insisted that one of the key criteria for triggering a no - notice inspection was concerns over safeguarding children			0
the chief inspector said 40 had already been mounted this term at schools where @entity11 had concerns over standards , and there were plans for more where ‘ regional intelligence ’ suggested that schools were failing to protect pupils from extremism			0
denying that he was bowing to pressure from teaching unions , sir @entity9 said : ‘ i ’m not caving in , because we are increasing the number of unannounced inspections			2
is it something we might want to consider in the future ? we will have a look at it			0
’ @entity129 , general secretary of the @entity130 , said : ‘ it is good news that @entity11 has decided against a move to routine no - notice inspections			1
’ since taking over as @entity135 in july , mrs @entity134 has reversed mr @entity9 ’s plans to make misbehaving children go for a run as a form of punishment , and in stark contrast to mr @entity9 ’s bullish stance towards the teaching unions – which he termed ‘ the blob ’ – she has vowed to do ‘ everything i can ’ to reduce teachers ’ workload .			2
