by @entity0 large families could see their child benefit slashed under plans being submitted to ministers			1
payments should be cut sharply for children after the third and limited to just four children in future , an influential think tank said			2
the proposal , which is published today by the centre - right @entity11 , would save £ 1billion over five years as benefit payments to large families would rise at a lower annual rate than those to smaller families			1
cut : the proposal published by the centre - right @entity11 would reduce payments to a family with four children by more than £ 135 a year by 2020 ( file picture ) it would reduce payments to a family with four children by more than £ 135 a year by 2020 – and go some way to help ministers hit their target of saving £ 12billion from the welfare budget over the next parliament			1
it is likely to cause controversy – as families who currently receive payments for several children would see their benefits gradually reduced			1
however , it may be seen as a more palatable option than imposing a stricter ‘ cap ’ on the number of children for whom parents can claim			0
a @entity42 poll , commissioned as part of the research , found two thirds of the public support capping child benefit at four children			1
this was backed by more than 83 per cent of @entity50 voters and more than half of @entity52 and @entity53 voters			0
@entity54 , the report author , said : ‘ the chancellor has suggested that annual welfare savings of £ 12billion will have to be found to avoid further and faster cuts to departmental budgets			1
‘ choosing where this money comes from is not easy , but with such high levels of public support , capping child benefit at four children and redesigning payment levels offers a very real opportunity to generate some much needed savings in the fairest way possible			1
’ this financial year , families receive £ 20.50 a week for their first child and £ 13.55 a week for each additional child , with no cap on numbers			0
decision : the reports author @entity54 said choosing where welfare cuts should be made is not easy payment amounts had been frozen since 2011 but rose by 1 per cent this tax year , with the same rise due next year			0
@entity11 proposes that until 2019/20 – the end of the next parliament – child benefit for the first child should rise by 1 per cent a year			2
for the second child the amount should rise by 2 per cent a year and for the third child by 1 per cent a year			0
but for the fourth child and any further children , the amount would be frozen at the 2015/16 level of £ 13.70 throughout the parliament			2
in addition , it suggests the government could go a step further and stop child benefit for any additional children after the fourth , born after april 2016			0
if the policy was implemented , a family of four would see their annual child benefit cheque fall from £ 3,481.40 to £ 3,346.20			2
@entity100 has suggested that a @entity50 government would seek to save billions more from the welfare budget if the party wins the next election			1
in january last year , around 1.1million parents lost some or all of their child benefit as income - related changes came into force			0
families in which one parent earns more than £ 60,000 before tax lost the benefit entirely , while those earning more than £ 50,000 lost some of it on a sliding scale .			0

it would reduce payments to a family with four children by more than £ 135
will go some way to help ministers save £ 12bn from the welfare budget
proposal published by @entity11 is likely to cause controversy
but recent @entity42 poll found two thirds of the public support capping benefit at four children
