by @entity0 published : 05:38 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 06:01 est , 8 august 2013 from a hunk of roast beef to a piece of sushi and a @entity7 's chicken , these foodie snaps are enough to make your savoury saliva glands start to drool			0
but before you get too excited about a slippery piece of salmon or a crispy roast potato , look a bit closer : these savoury foods are actually made of cake			2
these quirky sweet treats are the handiwork of creative baker @entity19 , a 23 - year old @entity20 who has just quit her job in advertising to pursue her fun kitchen hobby as a full time career , naming her business @entity25			1
incr - edible ! @entity19 , 23 , started baking in her free time , creating amazing designs like this uncanny roast beef and potato meal , and has now turned her hobby into a full - time business where it all started : @entity19 made this sausage and mash as a joke for a friend ... but on closer inspection it is sponge cake @entity19 has been baking since she was a young girl , and fondly remembers sitting on her kitchen surface helping her mother make cakes			1
after studying fashion marketing at university she landed a job in an advertising firm , and would bake cakes in her free time			0
she created her first sausage and mash cake as a joke for a friend 's birthday , but could n't believe the positive response she got			1
immediately she began creating more and more fake - savoury cakes in her free time , then posting the pictures on her @entity58 and @entity59 pages			0
as a result , orders began flooding in from people all over the internet			0
uncanny : @entity19 says this @entity65 's creation was the hardest she has ever made , and involved her individually rolling out each tiny piece of corn not your average meat - feast pizza : @entity19 quit her full - time job in advertising to pursue dreams of baking cakes that look exactly like savoury food speaking to @entity75 , she said : ' i was working really long hours and then would come home and bake			1
' i started taking it seriously a few years ago and then i got so much positive feedback that i thought " there must be something in this "			0
' after much umm - ing and ahh - ing i decided to quit my job to pursue this full - time			2
' @entity19 is currently in the process of launching a website and fully establishing her brand , which she has named @entity25 after close childhood friends , but she has already been flooded with requests for fun cakes			1
her cakes can take up to four hours to create - and often involve a lot of trial and error			2
she is planning on baking an eggs @entity95 - themed cake this weekend , as well as a cake styled like steak and chips , and a bunch of bananas			1
intricate detail : she describes herself as very determined and is always keen to perfect her cakes to the finest details - like each piece of beef in this burrito realistic : her creations , like this scarily realistic fish , chips and peas meal , take her around four hours to complete and often involve a lot of trial and error ' i do n't know how i am going to get the cake to look like a tomato in my steak and chips dish			1
but i love a challenge ! ' , she added			0
she cites her favourite - and most popular - cake as the roast beef one , and says the @entity65 's one was the hardest to create			2
' i rolled out each tiny piece of corn for the sweetcorn in the @entity65 's dish , which was hard , but i am always determined to complete a cake , even if it takes a few failed attempts			0
' master chef : @entity19 is the creative brains behind the cakes , and hopes to expand her business and deliver nationwide sweet sushi : whilst this sushi roll looks like it would taste fishy , you 'd be in for a sweet treat tucking into it creative eye : @entity19 studied elements of graphic design at @entity139 and credits this for her attention to detail it tastes sweeter than it looks ! @entity19 has been flooded by requests for cakes on her @entity58 and @entity147 , despite only starting a few weeks ago @entity19 , who studied fashion marketing at @entity149 and credits her creative skills to the graphic design she learnt , says she loves creating and making things , and has grand plans for the future			0
' i have only been doing this full - time for a few weeks , but you just have to run with these things			0
' at the moment i just offer hand - delivery to places in @entity20 , but the dream is to expand it nationwide and have a team of bakers helping me create wonderful cakes			1
' @entity166 with a twist : @entity19 loves taking on challenges , and while this spaghetti bolognese creation was one of the more simple , she is hoping to attempt making cake that looks like fruit next it 's not what it looks like ! this incredible @entity177 pasty looks like a tasty deep - fat treat - but when cut in half it is filled with delicious chocolate sponge			2

@entity19 , 23 , from @entity20 , is now pursuing baking full time
first cake was made as a joke for a friend ... but *impressed* everyone a lot
wants to create steak and chips , bananas and eggs @entity95 next
is in the process of launching a website and brand @entity25
