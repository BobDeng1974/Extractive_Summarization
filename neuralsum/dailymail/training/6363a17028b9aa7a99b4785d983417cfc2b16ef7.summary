@entity0 has launched an extraordinary attack on @entity3 supporters and claimed the players are no longer made to feel welcome at @entity5			1
@entity0 , who took an extra minute to come on as a substitute in the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity8 because he decided to change his boots when he was waiting to get on , insists the atmosphere is negative			1
the @entity3 forward , who went on to say that the fans should show him more respect for everything he has done in his career , said : ‘ when you are playing in front of your own crowd you want them to support you , but now it is like going through a sad moment and your family not welcoming you home			1
striker @entity0 has launched a scathing attack on the @entity3 supporters @entity0 said players would rather be away from home after fans opted to boo during the defeat by @entity8 @entity29 's @entity3 were embarrassed by @entity30 ( no 17 ) and @entity8 at @entity5 during the defeat by @entity8 on sunday , misplaced passes after 20 minutes were met with jeers as the @entity3 faithful made their dissatisfaction known			1
on their way to a fourth home defeat of the season , the players were booed off at half - time and fans had a few choice words for chairman @entity43 and technical director @entity44			1
and on @entity47 ' final whistle , music blasted out of the stadium speakers in an attempt to mask the full - time boos			2
‘ that ’s the worst thing ever because you have nowhere to go			2
at the moment i do n’t know whether we should play at home or whether we should play away			1
‘ ( at @entity61 their next game ) at least you know i am going to be having the majority of opposition fans booing me rather than our own fans booing me			1
and i am not just talking about me , i am speaking on behalf of all the players			2
‘ i think it might be better to play away from home at the moment because at least we know beforehand we are guaranteed to be booed because they want their home club to win			1
‘ but when you are playing at home and your own fans start booing you after a few minutes then it is harder			1
‘ so instead of booing people , which will make it even worse , i think it is sometimes better to support them and give them what they need to perform on the pitch			2
‘ and right now , to tell you the truth , i think a lot of players when they put on the shirt and go out on to the pitch , are finding it hard in the head			2
obviously i have been through a lot in life so i am used to it			2
the @entity3 supporters ( pictured observing a minute 's silence ) turned up in their droves to watch the defeat @entity101 defender @entity100 leads out his @entity3 team at @entity5 ahead of @entity103 ‘ obviously i was on the bench against @entity8 and , though i could not see everything as clear as night , i could see that nobody wanted the ball			1
it ’s hard for the players			2
‘ it ’s not their fault and it ’s not the fans ’ fault either because the fans want to see a result , the fans want to see a response and things are not going our way at the moment			1
we just have to fight as a team and as a club to find a solution			1
’ the players were booed off the pitch at half - time when @entity29 ’s team were 2 - 0 down against @entity132 ’ side			1
@entity0 tried his luck with a late header against @entity8 but it was n't to be for the @entity3 striker @entity29 has struggled for results since taking over from @entity138 in the summer @entity0 , axed for the clash with @entity8 after his half - hearted performance against @entity141 the previous weekend , added : ‘ to be honest , i do n’t know where to start from			1
at the moment , and i ’m not going to exclude myself , we are not playing good			2
we have to take it from there			2
‘ i want some of the players to be confident starting with me			2
obviously when i am trying my best and making runs and things are not happening and i am not making things happen like i used to , the criticism comes so quickly			2
‘ i think in football too many people forget so quickly what you have done			2
‘ it ’s kind of hard when you know the first bad ball you make , the fans are going to boo you			1
for 13 years now i ’ve been a professional and i ’ve had to deal with that stick everywhere i ’ve been to			2
‘ if i make a mistake it does n't mean i ’m lazy			0
i will always try my best			0
‘ but the funny thing in football is , when you score two goals everyone is like “ wow , he ’s back on form and back to his best ”			0
but that ’s not the point			0
even when things are n’t going my way i am still trying the same , running around , wanting the ball , jumping to head it and looking to play my football			0
‘ but now because i have missed a couple of chances , people are like “ whoa , he is not trying and should n't be in the first team ”			1
‘ as a footballer you have to deal with those things , but it does make you laugh			0
' @entity0 insists @entity29 has the backing of the players inside the dressing room , despite their fourth defeat at @entity5 in the @entity187			1
@entity29 has admitted he is under pressure to get results after a disastrous start to his career in charge of the club			1
the @entity3 players jump in unison during the warm up , but were beaten by the @entity197 the home support had something to cheer when @entity200 pulled a goal back for @entity3 @entity0 was n’t exactly primed for battle when @entity29 called on him to fire up @entity3 ’ strikeforce against @entity8			1
the substitute took an extra minute to get on the pitch because he decided to change his boots			0
still only five goals in his last 22 games ... @entity0 added : ‘ obviously all managers bring their own philosophies , the way they see football , the way they see games and everything			1
‘ but come on , this is the third or fourth manager in two or three years so we just have to stop it now being about the manager			1
he ’s a good manager and we just have to find a way so that we can try to understand what he wants to tell us and how he wants us to play and put that on the pitch			0
‘ if every player could do what the manager wants then we would win the @entity226			0
but at the moment we are not getting the message			0
to me , he is a good manager and a good man – we just have to get what he is telling us			0
‘ we have to get used to him			0
he is the new manager and it is tough			0
tactically , he is working hard , he is trying to make us understand what the opponents will try to do and what we have to do to score goals and win the games			0
@entity239 scored the opening goal for @entity8 as they went away to @entity3 and beat @entity29 's side @entity242 added a second for the @entity197 as they clinched all three points in north @entity246 spurs have lost four @entity187 home matches in five for the first time since may - october 2008 ( @entity250 ’ last five home @entity187 games as manager )			1
@entity3 0 - 3 @entity254 ; @entity3 0 - 1 @entity255 ; @entity3 1 - 2 @entity256 ; @entity3 1 - 2 @entity8 ‘ but at the moment there is a blockage somewhere			1
hopefully we can overcome that			0
football is a funny game , like i said			0
you play one game and score one goal and everybody says " hey , things have changed for you "			0
‘ maybe we can go out and win the next game 3 - 0 or 4 - 0 and that will be it – the fans will be back enjoying @entity3 again and we will have it like it was when i first came here on loan			1
‘ then every weekend i was happy to come in and play for the club because i knew i was going to have fun and enjoy it			0
now it is not fun anymore			0
‘ the critics are there and i welcome them – i take them in a good way and hopefully i will do my talking on the pitch			0
at the moment things are not going our way , but it can not go any lower than this			0
things can only get better			0
we have a new manager and i think he is a good manager			0
hopefully his preparations and message will come across quickly			0
we as players are trying to do what he tells us			0
‘ if we do this then i think we will be a good team because he loves playing from the back and attacking but now we are going through a difficult moment , which everyone should respect			1
that ’s all i will say			0
