by @entity0 a rip - off that cheats pensioners of £ 1billion in vital income is to be investigated by watchdogs			1
it is thought that 400,000 people a year are being denied up to £ 50,000 throughout their retirement			0
yesterday – following a campaign by @entity10 – the @entity8 announced it had launched an investigation into the scandal			1
the worst affected are the sick , smokers and the terminally ill who are being short - changed by insurers			1
industry figures show six in ten over- 55s should qualify for bigger pensions due to poor health but just two in ten claim them			0
the probe centres around annuities , which many people live off when they retire			1
the @entity8 says pensioners are losing out because they are not told what they are entitled to			1
on retirement most people turn their savings into a regular income for life , by buying an annuity			1
what they receive each year depends largely on how long they are expected to live			0
the shorter someone ’s life expectancy the more they should get because the ‘ pension pot ’ they have saved for all their life is being spread over a shorter period			1
conversely a healthy person expected to live for many years would receive less because their ‘ pot ’ has to last much longer			0
generally , those in poor health – a smoker or a diabetic – should get more			0
but they miss out because insurers encourage them to accept an average payout instead , which is usually meant for someone who is of perfect health			0
it means someone with a pot worth £ 100,000 would get a boost of £ 2,000 a year			0
this would be worth up to £ 50,000 over the course of a 25 - year retirement			2
industry figures show six in ten over- 55s should qualify for bigger pensions due to poor health			0
but just two in ten people claim them			0
‘ the way pensioners are deprived of money they have spent their whole lives saving is an absolute scandal , ’ said @entity64 , director - general of @entity65			1
‘ there must be some obligation on these companies to treat their customers fairly and ensure they do n’t spend their retirement in poverty			2
’ the @entity77 estimates the scandal is depriving the elderly of an estimated £ 1billion a year in much needed income			1
@entity81 , chief executive of the @entity77 , said : ‘ greater transparency in this market is essential if people are to have faith in pensions			0
‘ at the moment , consumers are dealing with an unfair and opaque system that is preventing too many of them from securing a decent income for their old age			2
people need to know that they can turn their savings pots into a good amount of income when they purchase an annuity			2
’ also hit are widows who , in the most shocking cases , are left penniless because their husbands were convinced to sign up to a deal that died with them			0
this is because the standard incomes offered by insurers cover just a single person			0
when that individual dies , their pension dies with them			2
married retirees can get an income which would keep paying money to their loved one when they die			2
yet insurers again fail to make this clear			0
every year thousands of women are left penniless because their husbands die before them and they have no pension of their own			2
the £ 1billion scandal is being compounded by huge falls in pensions caused by the @entity122 ’s policy of printing more money , known as @entity124			0
misleading pension deals have cost the elderly up to £ 1billion a year in lost income this has caused rates on annuities to plunge by more than a fifth in three years , stripping £ 1,418 a year from a £ 100,000 pension			1
last year , the @entity133 announced it would launch a code of practice to ensure pensioners shopped around to get better incomes			2
but as part of its @entity140 campaign @entity10 demanded an independent review by the @entity8 after it exposed loopholes in the code			1
yesterday , the watchdog announced it would probe the way pensioners took an income from their savings			1
@entity149 , head of life insurance at the @entity8 , said : ‘ an annuity purchase is an important one - off decision that has long term consequences for individuals if they get it wrong			1
‘ we want to understand the level of the potential detriment for consumers if they do not shop around , to see if there are ways to make this market work better for consumers			0
’ the results of the review will be published later this year			0
@entity167 , an independent financial adviser at @entity169 , said : ‘ insurers are making improvements but there are still pockets of sharp practice and it ’s right that the firms responsible come under closer scrutiny from the @entity8			1
’ @entity178 , director of life , savings and protection , at the @entity133 , said : ‘ any review of annuities would be timely			1
‘ the market is changing with @entity133 initiatives set to provide people approaching retirement with greater clarity and confidence as they prepare for retirement , and we are pleased that the @entity8 recognises this			1
’ annuity rates are unlikely to rise for some time because the incoming governor of the @entity122 , @entity194 , has intimated he intends to carry on printing money , believing it to be the most effective way to kick start the economy out of a possible triple - dip recession .			0
