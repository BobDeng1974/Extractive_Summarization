by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 04:25 est , 24 october 2012 public sector workers enjoy pensions that are worth 50 per cent more than the retirement payouts given to many private sector workers , a report said yesterday			1
the authoritative finding challenges union claims that the pensions of state workers have been destroyed by the government ’s reforms			0
the report , from the @entity12 , a non-political research body , said there were ‘ still significant differences between pensions in the public and private sectors ’			2
better off : despite numerous protests against public sector pension cuts , a new report has found that they still offer a better deal than most private sector pensions @entity24 , a director of the institute , said : ‘ even after the government ’s proposed reforms , the average value of the pension benefit would remain more valuable than the pensions which are most commonly available to employees in the private sector			1
’ the average public sector worker also earns a higher salary , works shorter hours and takes more sick days than the average private sector employee			1
under the reforms , which are being introduced at the moment , state workers must work longer and contribute more to their pensions			0
' extremely generous ' deal : @entity43 chief executive @entity42 supports the proposed pension reforms they have lost the link to their final salary and their pensions will be based on career average salaries , but their pensions remain gold - plated			2
the institute said that typically , their pensions are worth 15 per cent of their salary			0
before the reforms , they were worth 23 per cent			0
by comparison , a typical private sector worker ’s defined contribution pension is worth only 10 per cent of salary			1
the institute said that if state workers were to be stripped of their pension rights they would need to get a 15 per cent average increase in their salary to make up for the loss			0
most private sector workers do not have a company pension scheme , with the number of members at its lowest level since records began in 1953			1
only 2.9million of the 23.9million private sector workforce are in a company scheme			0
for private sector workers who have a gold - plated final salary scheme , it is highly lucrative , typically worth 23 per cent of their salary , but the numbers have collapsed			1
@entity75 , head of pensions research at the financial advisers @entity77 , said state workers have suffered ‘ some swingeing cuts ’ to their benefits in recent years			0
but he added : ‘ they will still do very well relative to the typical private sector worker			1
’ @entity42 , chief executive of the @entity43 ’ @entity43 campaign group , said : ‘ the vociferous opposition to any reform of public sector pensions looks even more out of touch with reality given this independent assessment			1
‘ even after necessary and moderate reform , public sector pensions will remain extremely generous , yet the unions still fight tooth and nail even the smallest of changes			2
well off : nearly 9000 retired @entity98 workers are on pensions worth between £ 50,000 and £ 100,000 a year ( posed by models ) ‘ it is absolutely right that those enjoying these premium deals should pay a fairer share of the cost of their retirement , especially as we are all living longer			2
’ the government ’s pensions tsar , @entity109 , the @entity111 minister who was the architect of the reforms , said state workers ’ pensions before the reforms were ‘ not sustainable and fundamentally unfair ’			0
for example , 8,700 retired @entity98 staff in @entity117 and @entity118 enjoy a pension worth between £ 50,000 and £ 100,000 a year			0
the institute ’s report looked at the four big public sector schemes , which cover @entity98 workers , teachers , local government staff and civil servants .			2

new report finds public sector worker pensions are worth 50 per cent more than private sector pensions
report by @entity12 claims public sector workers would still be better off than most in the private sector after pension reforms
public sector workers also earn more and work shorter hours
