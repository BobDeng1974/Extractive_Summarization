by @entity1 reporter more than two dozen solar flares have erupted from the @entity3 in the past seven days , catapulting radiation towards the @entity5 that could potentially play havoc with global communications			1
the @entity9 @entity8 issued four radio blackout warnings in the past two days after solar weather suddenly turned turbulent			1
radiation from flares can not penetrate @entity5 's atmosphere to harm life on the ground , but when intense enough it can disturb the atmosphere in the ionosphere , where gps and radio signals travel			1
scroll down for @entity21 violent : the fourth of the @entity3 's massive @entity24 flares in a fortnight , which peaked on october 29 is pictured			1
the image by @entity28 's @entity27 shows light in wavelengths of both 304 and 193 angstroms since october 23 the @entity3 has let loose with 24 medium - strength @entity32 solar flares , and four x-class flares - the most powerful kind			1
in fact , with our local star heading towards the peak of its 11 - year cycle , a period known as the solar maximum , this should n't be unusual			1
but lead up to the solar max has been unusually subdued this year			2
humans have tracked the solar cycle continuously since it was discovered in 1843 , and it is normal for there to be many flares a day during the sun 's peak activity			1
@entity52 , a solar physicist at @entity54 , told the @entity55 : ' it had n't been active in months , so it 's like it finally woke up			0
' for those of us who study the dynamics of the sun , it is exciting because it gives us more events to study			0
' solar flares happen when energy stored in magnetic fields twisted across the surface of the @entity3 is suddenly released			1
' you get a tangled bunch of magnetic fields , and they get too tangled and too stressed , they end up erupting , ' added dr @entity72			0
turbulent : another @entity24 flare exploding off the right side of the sun , peaking on october 27			0
this image is in the 131 @entity79 wavelength , which is particularly good for showing solar flares and is often coloured in teal the recent solar flare activity has also been accompanied by several coronal mass ejections ( @entity84 ) , say @entity28 officials			2
there are another kind of solar phenomenon that send billions of tons of particles into space that can reach @entity5 one to three days later			2
like the radiation from solar flares , these particles can not travel through the atmosphere to harm humans on @entity5 ; but they can affect electronic systems in satellites and on the ground			2
cmes can cause a space weather phenomenon called a geomagnetic storm , which occurs when they funnel energy into @entity5 's magnetic envelope , the magnetosphere , for an extended period of time			0
the @entity84 's magnetic fields peel back the outermost layers of @entity5 's fields changing their very shape , distortions which can can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected surges in power grids			0
they also can cause aurora			0
storms are rare during solar minimum , but as the sun nears solar maximum , large storms occur several times per year .			0

@entity9 @entity8 has issued four radio blackout warnings in two days
there have been 24 m - class and four x-class flares since october 23
the @entity3 is currently reaching the peak of its 11 - year solar cycle
