by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 21:28 est , 25 november 2013 when @entity2 introduced her new puppy patch to her family , she did n’t realise quite how much of a führer he would cause			0
for while the cute seven - week - old is quiet and cuddly , her daughter spotted his uncanny resemblance to @entity10			1
now he inspires her grandsons to do the goose - step and even responds to being called @entity10 or @entity10			2
spitting image : @entity10 ( left ) and patch the puppy ( right ) , who has an unfortunate resemblance to the 20th century dictator , but has a much gentler temperament a dark mark on his top lip mirrors the @entity22 's famous moustache			1
and another large brown area over his left ear completes the look of the 20th century dictator			1
but , according to his owner , the resemblance ends there as patch - unlike @entity10 - has a lovable temperament			1
the tiny puppy , a cross between @entity34 bulldog and a shih tzu , has two brothers and lives with owner @entity2 in @entity37			2
she said no - one calls him by his real name any more and @entity41 is starting to obey orders - as ' @entity10 ' or ' @entity10 '			1
mrs @entity2 said : ' none of us noticed the likeness until we put a photo on @entity47 and my eldest daughter saw it and said ‘ you 've got a little @entity10 there "			2
' although he 's called @entity41 , everybody calls him @entity10 now			1
my grandsons are the worst for doing the goosestep when the puppy 's around			0
' patch 's mother @entity58 , a @entity34 bulldog , and father @entity61 , a shih tzu , both belong to mrs @entity2 's daughter @entity63 , and patch belongs to @entity63 's 17 - year - old son @entity65			2
just obeying orders : patch the @entity10 look - a - like is a cross between a @entity34 bulldog and a shih tzu look - a - like : mrs @entity2 said : ' none of us noticed the likeness until we put a photo on @entity47 and my eldest daughter saw it and said ‘ you 've got a little @entity10 there " ' the three puppies in the litter are being reared at the family home until they reach 12 weeks old after @entity80 rejected them			1
mrs @entity2 added : ' he is a lovely little thing			0
all of them are , but he is the gentlest of them all			0
he will sit on your lap and just look at you until he falls asleep			0
' one of his brothers should be @entity10 as he has the attitude			0
that one 's the runt of the litter so he 's had to fight a bit more			0
' the tiny puppy , a cross between @entity34 bulldog and a shih tzu , with owner @entity100 in @entity37 @entity101 : a still from one of the many @entity104 propaganda films sent to @entity105 in the 30s showing @entity10 in full flow patch is n't the only pet that 's had an unfortunate resemblance to @entity10			1
after @entity110 introduced you to the house that looked like @entity10 two years ago , in @entity113 , south @entity114 , a series of readers sent in pictures of their cats that looked like the @entity104 dictator			0
in 2011 , a six - week - old puss was named @entity122 by staff at @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity126 , who took her in after she was found abandoned at a roadside			0
@entity122 , a kitten small enough to fit in a cup with a remarkable resemblance to @entity10 was looking for a home after being found abandoned at the side of a busy road			2

patch has a dark mark on his top lip mirrors just like @entity22 's moustache
he also has a large brown area over his left ear , like @entity10 's hair
but his owner , from @entity37 , *insists* the resemblance ends there
she says @entity41 is gentle and loveable - unlike his spitting image
