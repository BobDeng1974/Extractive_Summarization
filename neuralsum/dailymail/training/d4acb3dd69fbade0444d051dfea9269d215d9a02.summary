by @entity0 published : 09:18 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 02:39 est , 14 october 2013 victim turned detective @entity1 tracked down the thief who had ransacked his home when builder @entity1 received a call from his distraught wife to say £ 3,000 of gadgets and family heirlooms had been stolen from their home , he was initially furious			1
then he decided to get even – by tracking down the culprit and forcing him to hand back his possessions			0
three hours later , the father of two had returned home with most of the stolen goods – even before the police had finished taking down a statement from his wife			2
but to mr @entity1 ’s dismay , the officers accused him of ruining their own investigation and threatened him with arrest			1
now mr @entity1 , 32 , has been vindicated after a judge praised him for ‘ showing other people how to investigate a case ’ , and helping to convict serial burglar @entity26			1
mr @entity1 launched his own investigation straight after wife @entity28 , 33 , called him with the news their home near @entity33 , @entity34 , had been burgled			1
an @entity35 and two tablet computers belonging to daughters @entity38 , 15 , and @entity39 , 12 , had been stolen along with a laptop , camera , jewellery , a watch and heirlooms			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ i did what anyone should have done			1
i was so angry that my house had been burgled and i was not insured			0
‘ i knew i would never hear the last of it from my girls , and my wife was so upset			0
‘ @entity33 is not that big a place			0
people know each other in this town			0
’ @entity57 @entity56 heard mr @entity1 visited a bail hostel for criminals and promised £ 20 to a resident for information			1
the man revealed @entity26 ’s name and the estate where he lived			2
mr @entity1 quickly discovered that he knew @entity26 ’s girlfriend , @entity65 , from his school days			1
luckily she was in when he called at their home			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ i told her to get her boyfriend on the telephone			1
i was 90 per cent certain he had robbed my house			0
’ when @entity26 denied all knowledge , mr @entity1 threatened to ‘ ransack ’ his house and look for the stolen goods himself			1
@entity26 told mr @entity1 his possessions were ‘ under the bed in his daughter ’s room ’			1
miss @entity65 found a rucksack containing the valuables and handed them over			0
professional criminal @entity26 , who was tracked down by one of his victims , was found guilty of committing two burglaries on the same day around £ 600 of items – mainly jewellery – were missing			2
but on returning home triumphant , mr @entity1 said he was ‘ treated like a criminal ’ by police			1
they criticised him for threatening a witness and offering a reward			0
‘ they were threatening to arrest me			0
they were saying i had ruined the investigation , ’ he added			0
however , at @entity26 ’s trial last week , judge @entity98 was more forgiving			2
‘ i am sorry to say mr @entity1 has shown other people how to investigate a case , ’ he told the court			1
‘ i may not approve of all his behaviour			0
the police are not able to use his methods but at least he gave it a go and made all the inquiries			0
' he brought to justice a persistent long - term burglar			2
