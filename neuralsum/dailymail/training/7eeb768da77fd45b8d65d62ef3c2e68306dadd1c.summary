shops are keeping customers in the dark about their right to get repairs or refunds on faulty goods for up to six years after they bought them			1
many are denying any responsibility for helping customers once a product is outside its official warranty , which is wrong under consumer laws , say researchers			1
others are bouncing customers to manufacturers , when the law states that the retailer is responsible for dealing with complaints about products			2
@entity33 gives consumers some rights to refunds or free repairs for up to six years after the purchase of an item , which most do not realise			1
but these only apply if the product could reasonably have been expected to last six years or more and where it has been used properly , according to the manufacturers ’ instructions			1
consequently , a customer could argue that a washing machine or tv could be expected to last six years , but the same could not be said of a hairdryer			1
the consumer must also be able to show that a product has failed because it was not sufficiently robust when it was sold , which might require an expert report			2
but the scale of any redress is limited by the fact that the product has been used by the owner for a period of time			2
that means the owner could not expect a full refund on a £ 500 tv that has been used for five years			1
researchers at the consumer group which ? went under cover to ask staff at high street and internet retailers what customers ’ rights are when an electrical product becomes faulty outside its warranty			1
they also asked to speak to managers to see if they offered better information			0
the responses which ? received were rated under five headings , ‘ excellent ’ , ‘ good ’ , ‘ fair ’ , ‘ poor ’ and ‘ very poor ’			0
those judged as excellent accepted there were some rights and gave clear , accurate advice			2
poor staff created the impression that the shopper had no rights and should speak to the manufacturer , while those rated as ‘ very poor ’ denied the customer had any rights			1
@entity88 came out worst with nine out of 12 shop staff rated as poor or very poor			1
@entity90 prides itself on its customer service , but eight out of 12 staff were rated poor or very poor , which was the same as at @entity96			2
at @entity97 , seven out of 12 fell into the bottom two categories , while the score for @entity100 was six out of 12			0
the best performer was @entity102 , where only three out of 12 rated poor or very poor			0
all its managers offered a decent level of advice			0
which ? said : ‘ @entity96 was the only retailer to score an excellent rating for one of its shopfloor staff			0
’ the consumer group said the stores have improved the way they handle these queries since it surveyed them a year ago			0
@entity88 said its staff are given training on consumer law			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we accept our responsibility to ensure customers are given correct guidance when a problem arises			0
’ @entity90 said : ‘ our partners are trained to approach all customer problems with an open mind and the customer ’s best interests to the fore			0
’ @entity96 said : ‘ we do n’t feel the research reflects how we assist customers			1
we deliver beyond the legal requirement			0
’ @entity97 said : ‘ we work hard to provide exceptional customer service and value			0
’ @entity100 said : ‘ we take into consideration all facts and circumstances on a case - by - case basis to provide a fair solution			0
