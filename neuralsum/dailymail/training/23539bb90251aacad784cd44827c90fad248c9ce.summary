mr @entity40 said : ' we could not have avoided the damage caused by the storm but we could have responded to it better			0
' a lot of our employees had gone away for holidays so it meant we had a level of depletion in our resources - and that caused problems with getting people 's power restored			2
' it 's difficult to justify saying the company has performed well when customers have been without power for five days , but once we had an idea of how bad it was we were able to mobilise as many engineers and office staff as possible			1

' he said the south west will continue to bear the brunt of the storm			0
more bad news : the @entity89 has issued a severe weather warning over fears of strong gales of up to 80mph affecting @entity13 , southern , western and northern @entity93 and @entity94 today with more storms through the week the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) have around 100 flood alerts in place in southern , western and northern @entity93			1

the fresh wave of bad weather could see the figure for flooded homes double to more than 2,000 in the worst hit areas of @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			1

environment secretary @entity191 said he has pressed energy companies to stop staff taking new year holidays as a second week of storms looks set to derail the festive period			1
speaking on @entity197 's @entity196 programme , he said : ' i think some of them ( energy companies ) definitely let their customers down , and i 'm pleased to hear they are going to pay some compensation to those who are out of power			0
' we were told yesterday that the final 130 houses ( without power ) would all be back on by last night and i 'll have my daily meeting at nine when i hope to hear that has been achieved			0
' some of the companies have performed , some have not , and i think they have been penalised by the reaction of their customers			0
it 's up to them to compensate their customers			0
' we 've had two @entity215 ( the government 's emergency committee ) meetings over the last couple of days and we 've made it very clear that we expect them to take proper measures - not to let staff go away on holiday over the new year period and to be properly prepared for this week			1
' mr @entity191 added that emergency financial assistance - known as the @entity228 fund - could be made available to local authorities to ensure flood defences and power supplies remain intact			2
' it 's dreadful for all those involved but we do give credit to those in the @entity117 who worked throughout that period and who are working as we speak now , ' he said			0
' we 've had @entity215 meetings co-ordinating the other @entity217 departments , and local government has been told at every level that they must make sure they have adequate staff on over the new year period			2
