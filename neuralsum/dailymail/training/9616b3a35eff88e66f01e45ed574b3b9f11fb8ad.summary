' @entity1 sang at @entity90 's wedding in 1999 when she was 13 she said she was ' happy ' with the result in one sense , but added that she had discovered that , despite an apology , ' these people were prepared to go to any lengths to prevent me exposing their behaviour ' , including forcing her mother to relive the ' enormous personal distress ' she had been caused in 2005			1
