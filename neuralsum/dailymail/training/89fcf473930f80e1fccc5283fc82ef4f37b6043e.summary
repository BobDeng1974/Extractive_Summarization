@entity0 opted for subdued but smart @entity2 style for her husband ’s keynote speech today			2
the prime minister ’s wife likes to keep her look simple when it comes to supporting @entity8 at key events , and often chooses affordable off - the - peg pieces to show supporters that she is n't immune to the national tightening of the purse strings			1
but while her @entity16 dress said ' i 'm one of you ' , the designer belt that she chose to wear it with shouted ' not really , only pretending ! ' thanks to the price tag being almost five times that of the polyester dress			1
@entity0 and @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity0 wearing her @entity16 dress and @entity27 belt prime minister @entity23 with wife @entity0 following his keynote speech on the final day of the @entity30 at @entity31 in @entity32 @entity0 teamed a teal pencil dress from @entity2 brand @entity16 with a @entity36 - effect coat that she has been spotted in throughout the conference at least @entity0 , 42 , was recycling : she cinched the waist of her £ 42 stretch teal dress with one of her favourite @entity27 belts			1
the £ 196 croc - effect belt has been worn to several high profile events , including a trip to see the @entity45 in 2012			1
@entity23 with @entity0 walk from the @entity46 to the @entity47 before his keynote speech to delegates at the @entity30 at @entity31 , @entity24			1
prime minster @entity23 ( r ) arrives with his wife @entity0 before delivering his keynote speech on the last day of the annual @entity30 at @entity31			1
@entity0 is a firm fan of @entity27 and is often seen donning her designs , which are also favoured by the @entity53			2
the fashion fan seems to have packed away her summer wardrobe as she teamed the knee - length shift with a coat from @entity59 that she has been spotted in throughout the conference			1
on wednesday she wore the same coat with tones of grey and nodded to her fashion know - how by finishing off the look with stylish touches such as a @entity67 collared shirt , a dove grey travel wallet and chunky patent heels			2
today ’s look is simple but effective and while it is n’t the first lady ’s finest fashion moment it will be a hit with working women everywhere , and the wool @entity36 - effect coat is a sure - fire sell out			2
@entity23 told wife @entity0 he was ' incredibly proud ' of her as she watched him make his keynote speech to the @entity30 conference in @entity24			2
@entity0 looked smart yet stylish as she arrived at the @entity46 in @entity24 the prime minister singled her out near the front of the audience as he hailed the ' national heroes ' who drive the economy by setting up their own businesses			0
' to all those people who strike out on their own , who sit there night after night , checking and double checking whether the numbers stack up , i say i have so much respect for you			0
' you are national heroes , ' he said			0
' i 'll never forget watching @entity0 do just that - winning her first customer , sorting out the cash flow , that magic moment when she got her first business cards printed , ' he said			0
' i was incredibly proud of her then - and i am incredibly proud of you now			0
' mrs @entity0 's first business designed shop window displays , interiors and packaging and one of her clients was luxury stationers @entity106			0
she later joined and became creative director			2
she stepped down from that position into a part - time role shortly after mr @entity23 entered @entity110 as premier in may 2010			0
as he received an ovation from activists at the end of his speech , he brought mrs @entity0 onto the stage to share the plaudits			0
being the former creative director for a luxury leather goods brand @entity106 and ambassador to the @entity122 , it 's no surprise @entity0 takes her role as first lady of fashion extremely seriously			0
she may have been wearing a high - street dress but @entity23 's wife added a designer touch to her outfit today with an @entity27 belt			1
belted up : @entity0 opted for an @entity27 belt with her @entity16 dress the £ 196 @entity133 ( down to £ 98 in a recent sale ) comes complete with an adjustable double gold - tone stud fastening			1
it 's not the first time that @entity0 has donned the design			0
she was spotted wearing it on two occasions in march last year during her trip to the @entity142 - and she clearly likes it so much , she even snapped one up in navy as well as black			0
