@entity0 faces @entity1 as a @entity3 player for the first time on sunday			1
he ’s been away in @entity5 for the past three years and we only hope he has n’t forgotten the code of conduct which exists on these shores relating to players and their former clubs			2
just in case he needs a refresher , here ’s @entity16 ’s quick guide … @entity0 wears the same no 4 shirt at @entity3 ( right ) that he did at @entity1 ( left ) get out , get in … when @entity0 arrives at @entity19 there are sure to be plenty of @entity1 fans in attendance			1
ok , sign their programme , but do not pose for selfies or engage in lingering conversation about the @entity27			2
in fact , have you still got those oversized headphones from the adidas @entity32 advert ? it ’s all change , but do n’t change your changing room … @entity0 has still played at @entity19 more times for @entity1 than he has for @entity3			1
so just be careful which dressing - room you end up in			2
it ’s the one marked ‘ home ’			2
@entity0 slides in to a tackle in a friendly against @entity41 back in 2004 warm your muscles , not your vocal chords … it is a familiar sight , former players bouncing around the halfway line waiting for an old pal to chat with			1
do n’t do it , just get on with the pre-match warm - up			0
send them a @entity51 from the changing room instead			0
@entity0 , give us a wave … do n’t			1
poor @entity55 fell foul of that recently on his return to @entity60			0
you ’ve got to resist all invites to exchange in - game pleasantries with the fans who once isolised you			0
celebration time … again , do n’t			2
do n’t celebrate any goal – for @entity1 or @entity3			1
you ’ve got to remain stony - faced throughout			0
you ’re a professional , goals disgust you			0
no , you ’ve got to behave as if 0 - 0 would be the dream outcome			0
@entity0 takes on the @entity70 defence during @entity3 's 1 - 0 win on tuesday night @entity0 has made an impressive start to his career at @entity19 i ’ve scored , but i wish i had n’t … inside you may well be buzzing with your 25 - yard rocket in to the top corner , but do n’t let it show			1
you ’ve got to make out as if @entity78 was your intended target and the shot took a horrible dip in to the back of the net			0
these new balls , honestly			0
the post-match interview … do not conduct your media duties wearing @entity88 ’s shirt			0
and , when asked the inevitable about the reception from @entity1 fans , reply with the dutiful and well - worn ‘ it was nice , i enjoyed my time there , i always look for their result and i wish them all the best for the season ahead ’			1
back - page stuff , eh ? video no animosity towards @entity0 - @entity100			1
