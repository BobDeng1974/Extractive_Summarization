dazed and confused , blood dripping from his mouth , @entity42 is encircled by thugs after being savagely beaten to the ground during the violence in @entity37 from nowhere , an apparent @entity65 walks up and lends a hand to help heave the struggling and injured victim up from the pavement lowest of the low : the teenager continues to tend to the wounds on his face as thieves make off with the contents of his rucksack infamous : millions of people around the world watched in horror cctv footage of 21 - year - old @entity42 being robbed by men purporting to be good samaritans discarded : the thief , having taken the items from the teenager 's bag , then casually throws them to the floor before strolling away @entity88 said it could not reopen its investigation because there was no evidence anyone else was behind the crime			1
detectives said every lead on the case had been ‘ exhausted ’ and they could not start again without fresh information			0
@entity6 and @entity7 , who served 16 months , shouted ‘ get in ! ’ and ‘ free men ’ as they bounded down the steps of the @entity101			1
hugging his mother @entity102 , @entity7 said police must now apologise , adding : ‘ the police , the way the police investigated , everything they did was wrong			1

here he is pictured at home in @entity34			0
right he is sitting with his eight - year - old brother @entity128 shocking amateur footage on @entity130 showed mr @entity42 being robbed in @entity131 , @entity37 , on august 8 , 2011			1
moments earlier the young accountancy student , who had been in the @entity18 only a month , had his jaw shattered by another rioter as he cycled through a crowd			1
as blood poured from his mouth one man put his arm around his shoulders while the other went through his rucksack before strutting away with a £ 500 games console			0
@entity6 and @entity7 insisted it was not them			1
but a @entity27 jury convicted them on the back of evidence from anonymous witnesses			0
one said he recognised @entity7 ’s clothes and his distinctive walk and another identified @entity6 from part of his face and his tracksuit bottoms			1
the trial judge said the pair brought shame on the country and branded the footage an ‘ iconic image of lawlessness ’			2
mr @entity42 was treated at @entity163 , @entity164 , following the attack @entity6 , who grew up in care , was jailed for four years and three months for robbery and violent disorder			1
@entity7 , a heavy cannabis user with convictions for theft , affray and assaulting a police officer , was jailed for five years for robbery , violent disorder and burglary			1
but all the convictions were overturned by the country ’s top judge , the lord chief justice , lord judge			1
his panel has yet to give full reasons			0
a @entity182 spokesman said the hearing was held in private to protect the identity of the witnesses			0
solicitor @entity187 compared her clients ’ case to that of @entity191 who was wrongfully convicted of murdering tv presenter @entity193			0
she said : ‘ they wanted somebody who fitted the bill			0
’ @entity131 mp @entity197 called on the authorities to try again to catch those responsible			1
but a @entity201 spokesman said : ‘ all lines of inquiry have been exhausted and no further investigation can be undertaken unless new information is forthcoming			0
’ @entity206 , who raised thousands of pounds for mr @entity42 with an internet campaign , said the student remains in @entity18 and is ‘ keeping his head down ’			1
@entity6 , who is a trainee youth worker , served six months in prison for robbing the same victim twice in one day in 2005			2
studies have shown that most of those jailed for their part in last summer ’s riots have already been released			2
many have been freed little more than ten months after the rioting and in some cases before the halfway point of their sentences			0
one academic critic said most of the august 2011 rioters were released in time to be on the streets for any potential repeat of the trouble this year			1
in june , only 692 people remained in jail for their part in the mayhem , or were on remand awaiting trial for serious crimes			2
a further 710 had served their jail term and been released			0
@entity233 flared in @entity234 , @entity235 , on august 6 last year after a protest over the fatal police shooting of local man @entity238			1
the trouble spread to @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 , with shops looted and buildings torched			0
an official inquiry into the five days of violence , which cost the country at least £ 500million , concluded that the shameful scenes were motivated by greed			0
a panel set up by deputy prime minister @entity252 criticised the police for not getting a grip on the violence , but said the rioters ’ main objectives were getting their hands on ‘ luxury branded goods ’ which ‘ confer instant status ’			0
a criminal is typically released after half the sentence has been served – but if the treatment of rioters in prison had been in keeping with the tough policies the courts took when sentencing them , participants in the august disturbances would have been held for longer			2
@entity270 figures show that the average sentence for the 1,029 rioters jailed by the @entity273 was 19.4 months			2
such offenders would normally expect to serve nearly ten months in jail before being freed			0
but it is believed there are still criminal cases involving offences connected to last year 's riots have yet to be completed .			2

millions of people watched in horror the @entity285 footage of 21 - year - old @entity42 being robbed
@entity287 , 23 , and @entity7 , 25 were jailed for robbing him , but saw their convictions overturned today
mr @entity42 had only moments earlier had his jaw shattered by another rioter as he cycled in @entity131 , east @entity37 , in august 2011
