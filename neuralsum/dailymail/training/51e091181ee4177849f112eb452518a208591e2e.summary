by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 19 august 2013 neanderthals were more culturally complex than previously thought , according to scientists who have studied prehistoric handaxes			0
the design of handaxes , the multipurpose tool used by @entity1 primarily to prepare food , were passed down the generations and demonstrate social learning in different groups living in what is now modern @entity12			1
two cultural traditions existed among @entity1 living in northern @entity12 between 115,000 to 35,000 years ago , the researchers said			1
dr @entity15 from the @entity16 for the @entity17 examined the design of 1,300 stone tools ( pictured ) originating from 80 neanderthal sites in five @entity12 countries ; @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26 dr @entity15 from the @entity16 for the @entity17 at the @entity27 examined the design of 1,300 stone tools originating from 80 neanderthal sites in five @entity12 countries ; @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26			1
dr @entity15 ’ investigations uncovered new evidence that two separate handaxe traditions or designs existed ; one in a region now spanning south - western @entity22 and @entity25 and the other in @entity23 and further to the @entity37			1
she also found an area covering modern day @entity24 and the @entity26 that demonstrates a transition between the two			0
she told @entity40 the handaxes were used for similar functions - to butcher animals , woodworking and hideworking - in both regions she studied and described them as ' multifunctional tools '			2

the study found the design of handaxes was passed down generations in different groups living in what is now modern @entity12 dr @entity15 said : ' in @entity23 and @entity22 there appears to be two separate handaxe traditions , with clear boundaries , indicating completely separate , independent developments			1
' the transition zone in @entity24 and @entity22 indicates contact between the different groups of @entity1 , which is generally difficult to identify but has been much talked about , especially in relation to later contacts with groups of modern humans			1
' dr @entity69 said the handaxes were used for similar functions in both regions she studied and described them as ' multifunctional tools ' ' this area can be seen as a melting pot of ideas where mobile groups of @entity1 , both from the eastern and western tradition , would pass by – influencing each other ’s designs and leaving behind a more varied record of bifacial tools			1
' the @entity27 research has revealed @entity1 in the western region made symmetrical , triangular and heart - shaped handaxes , while during the same time period , in the eastern region , they produced asymmetrically shaped bifacial knives			1
dr @entity15 said : ' distinct ways of making a handaxe were passed on from generation to generation and for long enough to become visible in the archaeological record			2
' this indicates a strong mechanism of social learning within these two groups and says something about the stability and connectivity of the @entity1 populations			1
' making stone tools was not merely an opportunistic task			2
a lot of time , effort and tradition were invested and these tools carry a certain amount of socio - cultural information , which does not contribute directly to their function			0
' dr @entity69 told @entity40 that microscopic usage analysis showed traces of what the tools were used for			0
archaeologists believe they were used for three primary activities : the study also said other factors previously thought to have determined the shape of handaxes , including the raw materials available to @entity1 , the function of their sites or the repeated reuse and sharpening of tools , did n’t have an impact			2
she told @entity40 the ' cultural pattern overrides the other factors '			0
dr @entity69 said : ' there was a habit to make the handaxes in a certain way [ in distinct groups ] that was passed down generation to generation			2
' it was a conscious decision to make them [ the tools ] in a certain way			0
' she also said that there was ' no link ' between the different shaped tools being used for different tasks			0
the various shaped handaxes are all thought to be multipurpose prehistoric tools			0
dr @entity69 ' research , which was published in the @entity149 , adds to an emerging archaeological perspective on @entity1 regionality , which is a concept also identified in studies of their skeletal and genetic features .			0
