it ’s nice to know he appreciates them , but i wo n’t let things go too far			2
' my last relationship ended because he was too scared to have sex with me			1
i do n’t want that to happen again			2
' @entity5 says she demands sex up to five times a day , blaming high oestrogen levels for both her libido and big breasts			1
she said : ' i read on the internet that high oestrogen levels can make your breasts grow , so i ’m guessing that ’s what ’s causing it			1
' i ’ve been to the doctor but they did n’t know what was wrong			0
it ’s got to the point now where i ’m terrified they wo n’t stop growing			2
' when @entity5 was 11 , she went for her first bra fitting and discovered she was a c cup			1
@entity5 , who claims her 40mmm breasts are the biggest in @entity4 , says she has started to make a glamour modelling career off the back of them she said : ' @entity61 and dad joked that i went to bed and came downstairs the next morning with massive knockers			1
' at the time i was so embarrassed			2
girls at school used to unclip my bra strap during assembly , while boys stared at my boobs as though they were from outer space			0
i used to sleep on my front hoping they would n’t grow anymore			0
' but by the time she turned 12 , she ’d shot up to a @entity78 cup			1
she said : ' everyone always thought i was older than i was			0
sometimes the bus driver would n’t let me on with a child fare - it was so humiliating			0
' by the time @entity5 turned 16 , they ’d swelled to an h cup			1
she said : ' i was told to cover up in my local church in case i led the men into temptation			0
' but the advice from the church had the exact opposite effect on the teen			0
@entity5 said : ' i was angry - after all i thought , " it ’s not my fault "			1
so i decided to rebel , getting rid of all my turtle necks in exchange for spaghetti string tops			0
even though i did n’t like my boobs , they were a part of me			0
i was tired of pretending to be someone i was n’t			0
' by the time @entity5 turned 18 , her breasts had grown to a @entity106 cup , swamping her size 6 frame			1
she said : ' i looked ridiculous , though i always received appreciative stares from men			0
i desperately hoped that the growth spurt had come to an end because i ’d started to get scared			2
i did n’t know what i ’d do if they kept on growing			0
i considered a breast reduction , but the thought of a surgeon hacking away at my breasts terrified me			1
' but the biggest threat was n’t to @entity5 - it was to her boyfriend			1
when @entity5 was 27 , ex-boyfriend @entity121 nearly died when she suffocated him with her 40ll breasts which weighed more than a stone each			1
@entity5 said she had considered a breast reduction , but it is not an option because her @entity127 is too high for surgery @entity5 , pictured at the age of 21 , would need to lose eight stone for a reduction to be carried out safely she said : ' usually , he loved being smothered by them , and on this occasion , he started flailing around wildly			1
but i assumed it was because he was so excited , so i kept going			0
a few minutes later , i noticed he ’d stopped moving			0
' by then @entity121 , also 27 , was still and appeared not to be breathing			0
@entity5 said : ' i was panicking and was just about to call 999 when thankfully he started to come round			1
he appeared dazed and confused but then he sat up and coughed			0
' @entity5 has rekindled a relationship with old flame @entity16 , whom she married aged 21 but later split from but after @entity121 ’s near death experience , the couple ’s sex life flagged			1
@entity5 said : ' after that , he went right off sex			1
' the pair split up three months later , while her breasts continued to grow			2
she said : ' they were showing no signs that they were about to stop growing , so i knew i had to start taking precautions			0
' when @entity5 managed to rekindle a relationship with old flame @entity16 , whom she married aged 21 but later split from , she knew she was treading on thin ice			2
@entity5 , who now has three children with @entity16 - aged three , six , and nine , said : ' i knew @entity16 loved my boobs , but i could n’t put his life at risk			2
so we devised a safety precaution where he ’d tap my leg if it ever gets too much , and i ’d climb off			0
' @entity5 , who claims her 40mmm breasts are the biggest in @entity4 , says she has started to make a glamour modelling career off the back of them			1
she said : ' i ’ve got a lot of fans in @entity168 , so it would be great to go over there and tap the market			0
' but behind the glitz and glam , @entity5 reveals that having big breasts is not easy			1
she said : ' i get back ache all the time			2
and doing simple things , like tying my shoelaces or running after the kids , is impossible			0
' shops never stock my bra size , so the only option is to get one tailor made , but that costs £ 200			2
and while some women might like the attention from men , not all of it ’s flattering			0
' in fact , most of it ’s rather unimaginative - " get em out " , " look at the size of em " and so on , but when someone tries to pull your dress down in a bar , it ’s not funny			2
@entity5 says she suffers from back ache and finds it difficult to do simple things , such as tying her shoelaces or running after her children @entity5 's partner @entity16 has said he will support whatever decision she makes when it comes to whether she should have a breast reduction ' sometimes , when the straps on my top have snapped under their weight , i ’ve come home holding my clothes up and desperate for a breast reduction			1
' but for @entity5 , a breast reduction is n’t an option			1
weighing 20 stone , @entity5 ’s @entity127 is too high for surgery			2
she would need to lose eight stone for a reduction to be carried out safely			2
she said : ' sometimes i do think i would like a reduction , but i know i ’d need to lose weight first			0
even so , i do n’t know how i ’d feel having smaller breasts			0
i do n’t know if i ’d be the same person and it would most certainly end my modelling career			0
' meanwhile @entity5 ’s partner @entity16 is prepared to support whatever decision she makes			1
he said : ' obviously i love @entity5 ’s breasts - i ’ve had a lot of fun with them			1
but i ’ll support whatever decision she makes as i just want her to be comfortable - it ’s her body at the end of the day			0
