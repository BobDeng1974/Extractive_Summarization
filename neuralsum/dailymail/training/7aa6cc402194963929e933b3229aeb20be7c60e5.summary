by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 12:51 est , 10 march 2014 when it senses danger , @entity2 sends out huge plumes of plasma to protect itself against devastating solar storms			1
and now , for the first time , scientists have been able to watch this incredible process using satellites and ground - based detectors			1
the discovery confirms age - old theories about the @entity2 's magnetic field and could provide scientists with a way to better to model the planet ’s natural shield			1
spacecraft have observed how dense particles can ' snake up ' along magnetic field lines as cold plasma @entity2 ’s protective field , known as the magnetosphere , extends thousands of miles into space affecting everything from global communication to animal migration			1
when the sun 's magnetic field directly links with @entity2 's , it can create cracks in the magnetosphere allowing solar winds to punch holes into the ozone layer			1
usually this creates auroras in the sky , but it can also knock out power grids , radically change @entity2 ’s climate and drive up rates of cancer			2
a thin layer of cold , dense material called the plasmasphere surrounds @entity2			0
researchers have found that material in the plasmasphere can help prevent particles from the sun crossing into near @entity2 space the @entity2 's plasmasphere is an inner part of the magneteosphere - the protective magnetic bubble are @entity2			1
it is a region of dense , cold plasma that surrounds the @entity2			0
although plasma is found throughout the magnetosphere , the plasmasphere usually contains the coldest plasma			0
in certain circumstances dense particles in the plasmasphere send a plume up to meet – and help block – incoming solar material			0
in certain circumstances dense particles in a layer of the uppermost atmosphere called the plasmasphere send a plume up to meet – and help block – incoming solar material			0
‘ it ’s like what you might do if a monster tried to break into your house , ’ said @entity72 , a space scientist at @entity75 ’s @entity74			0
‘ you ’d stack furniture up against the front door , and that ’s close to what the @entity2 is doing here			2
‘ the material that is usually much nearer @entity2 stacks up against the outer boundary of the magnetosphere , throttling the interaction there and stopping solar material from entering			2
’ while ground - based measurements can see a plume forming , their resolution is n't good enough to confirm whether the material reaches the magnetic boundary			0
the @entity2 's plasmasphere is an inner part of the magneteosphere - the protective magnetic bubble are @entity2 that shields against solar winds in january last year , gps sensors on the ground mapped electrons in the upper atmosphere and saw a tendril of electron density moving away from the @entity107			1
through sheer luck , three of @entity75 's @entity109 spacecraft , which are designed to study solar storms , crossed through the magnetic boundary at that very moment			2
the @entity109 craft saw a 100-fold increase in the number of electrons at the boundary , indicating that a plume of plasma was veering off towards the sun. eventually these observations could lead to improvements in space weather predictions , which would be as useful for spacecraft operators as terrestrial weather forecasts are for us here on @entity2			0

@entity109 showed that the tongue of this cold , dense plasmasphere material stretched all the way up to the magnetic reconnection point			0

for the first time , scientists have *captured* the process using satellites
the discovery confirms age - old theories about the @entity2 's magnetic field
it could provide scientists with a way to better model the *behaviour* of the magnetosphere - the planet ’s natural shield against solar winds
