by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 01:35 est , 7 august 2013 lying almost 4,000 metres above sea level , this vast salt lake nestled amid the snow - capped peaks of @entity5 's @entity4 is one of the highest in the world			1
believed to have been formed when a meteor struck the earth millions of years ago , the aquamarine waters of @entity9 appear oasis - like amid the barren , stony landscape of the soaring @entity13 - known since @entity15 times as the ' roof of the world '			1
but despite its beauty , the ancient lake is home to little marine life aside from a few hardy loaches , and locals claim the water is so dense with salt that anyone who tried to sail a boat across the surface would find themselves capsizing			1
the more dense water is , the more likely it is that things floating on its surface will become unbalanced , because the depth of flotation is much higher			0
@entity9 is an inhospitable environment for its few inhabitants - a small community of @entity57 people living in a village that takes its name from the lake			2
the community survives in the bleak region on the border with @entity64 , one of @entity66 's most sparsely populated regions , through the nomadic herding of flocks of sheep , yaks or goats			0
the villagers spend the summer in the high pastures , but in winter return to @entity9 , tending fires in their yurts to endure the penetrating cold in the mountains , which can plummet to -45c in the winter months			0
the lake is famous for the ever - changing colours of its surface , which reflects the surrounding peaks and shimmers dark green , azure or light blue depending on the light			0
but when the sun slips behind the clouds the depths of the lake - which is 238metres deep in parts - appear dark as night			2
it is the this quality that saw the ancient crater lake christened @entity9 , or the ' black lake '			0
in the 19th century the @entity95 named the salt lake @entity15 in honour of their monarch , and all @entity95 maps from that period label it as @entity15 of the @entity13			1
that name is understood to have fallen out of use with the advent of the @entity105 , and once again the salt lake became known by its @entity57 title			2

stunning scenery : the vast salt lake , the highest of the @entity4 and the biggest of hundreds of ancient lakes in the region , makes for spectacular scenery bleak : lying at the extreme edges of habitation , the landscape surrounding the lake has no trees of flowers , and is home only to the occasional sheep or yak endurance : the area around @entity9 is home to a village of the same name , where a small community of @entity57 live in yurts and herd yaks and sheep barren : rocky ground surrounds the lake in the @entity13 in @entity5 , close to the border with western @entity136 vast : the high salt content in the lake 's waters mean @entity9 is home to scant marine life , apart from a few hardy loaches shades : the clear waters of @entity9 can take on dazzling shades of green or blue - but its shadowy appearance when the sun moves behind the clouds mean it is sometimes known as the ' black lake ' high altitudes : the high , rugged peaks of the @entity13 are reflected in the glassy surface of the ancient salt lake , believed to have been formed when a meteor struck the earth remote : @entity157 lies in the @entity158 close to the border with @entity64 , @entity136 , in one of the most sparsely populated regions of @entity66 inhospitable : @entity9 's inhabitants , nomadic farmers , spend the summer months in the high pastures before returning to the village in winter , burning fires to ward off the penetrating cold the ' roof of the world ' : divided into two basins , @entity9 sits amid spectacular scenery in the rugged @entity158 survival : the small @entity57 community in the village of @entity9 spend the summer months in the high pastures , before returning to the village to sit out the bitter cold lone : lying close to the border with @entity64 in western @entity136 , the lake is within one of the most sparsely populated regions of @entity66 views : the surface of the water changes from black to azure to deepest green depending on how the light falls on @entity9 vast : in @entity186 times the @entity95 marked the lake on maps as @entity15 , in honour of their monarch , but the name fell out of use with the advent of the @entity105 nomadic : the @entity57 community that lives in the village of @entity9 in the remote region herds small flocks of sheep , goat or yaks amid the barren landscape			1
