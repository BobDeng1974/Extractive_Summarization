that 's another fine @entity21 @entity21 versus @entity22 is turning out to be an interesting @entity24 sub-plot			1
the brilliant @entity25 took his tally for the tournament to four , level with his @entity29 rival			0
first up : @entity21 's strike sails past @entity31 in the @entity5 goal for opening goal each player has his nation 's hopes resting on his shoulders and neither is disappointing			1
@entity21 now has 24 goals from 23 internationals , so where is the evidence for the accusation that he is n't as good for @entity42 as he is for @entity43 ? @entity45 's nickname is unfortunate and unfair			1
