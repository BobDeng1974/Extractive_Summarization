@entity0 believes @entity1 have the best strike force in the world , which is some claim considering what other predators are lurking out there			1
the @entity12 , in discussing his excitement at playing alongside @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , said : ‘ i think we have maybe the best three strikers in the world here in @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
’ but can that trio compare to @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 ? how does it rate against what might be a remarkable combination of @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , once the latter returns from suspension ? then there ’s @entity30 and his understudies at @entity32			1
and the mixture of elegance and killer instinct at @entity36			1
the wide boys at @entity38 also make a compelling case			2
here , @entity40 rules on the best forward lines in the game			2
@entity1 @entity11 celebrates after scoring his first goal for @entity1 against @entity44 @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) make up the @entity1 front three big names , but yet to live up to @entity0 ’s billing			1
all three have rightly been considered world class at one time or another but how close are they to their respective peaks ? and how much is reflective of the inadequacies behind them ? @entity54 , at 31 , does not quite look like the same brilliant player he was in his first @entity57 season , while @entity11 has not yet hit his stride			1
on his day he is perhaps the most lethal finisher in the game			0
this trio needs more time and extra support			2
@entity64 @entity65 @entity25 and @entity24 are two of @entity64 's formidable front three @entity26 is yet to play a competitive game for @entity64 following his ban for biting during the @entity69 in theory , and according to our ratings , this is the best line - up in the world			1
@entity26 remains an unknown , owing to the ongoing uncertainty over how he will fit in with a new team and the role that he will play			1
he will stand alongside arguably the greatest player in history , in @entity24 , who has already scored six and made six in seven @entity80 games			1
@entity25 is n’t bad , either			1
in fact , the @entity82 ’s strike - rate of a goal every 49 minutes is bettered only by @entity18 ( of players who have played more than once )			1
it remains to be seen if the attack is worth more than the sum of its parts , but they are extremely talented parts			0
@entity92 ready for @entity93 @entity94 @entity95 scored in @entity94 's last win over @entity97 before the international break @entity99 and @entity100 played a key role in @entity94 winning the title last season @entity40 ’s @entity104 recently listed @entity100 as one of the @entity107 ’s best 11 imports and rightly so			1
he is a master of evasion , so clever in his runs , passing and ability to find space , but he could still score more goals			0
@entity113 is the man who makes the tangible difference and already has an excellent record this season			0
at 26 , he is heading into the fabled peak time of his career			0
@entity99 , at 27 , has played more than 250 games in @entity121 football , but is currently injured			2
@entity36 @entity122 has made an immediate impact at @entity36 and has scored nine goals so far this season both @entity125 ( left ) and @entity126 have played key roles in @entity36 being top of the @entity107 in @entity126 , @entity36 have one of the best , most dynamic dribblers in @entity130			1
a man of small stature and questionable work rate , he scores goals and he makes them			0
@entity125 , meanwhile , is rapidly emerging and , perhaps predictably , has drawn comparisons to @entity136			1
the crown jewel , without dispute , is @entity122			1
he is what @entity36 so badly needed and what they so badly failed to find for a number of years – a striker worth comparing to @entity143			2
@entity144 described him this month as a ‘ killer ’ and his goals ratio proves the point			0
the best striker in the @entity107			2
@entity38 @entity149 and @entity150 have formed a good partnership for @entity38 this season @entity152 has only played once this season due to injury - but he still scored , against @entity155 @entity152 has played less than one full game because of injury so it is hard to know what to expect from the brilliant @entity160 , who is now 31 and has been central to @entity38 ’s rise to the top			2
with @entity150 in the same side , it is possible to argue @entity38 have the best wide players of any side			0
the @entity167 is perhaps the strongest candidate for the ‘ third best player in the world ’ candidate and has already scored three @entity172 goals and made two more this season			2
@entity149 has done well since joining @entity38 , scoring four league goals in three games and also making two , having notched more than 20 @entity172 strikes in each of his past three seasons			0
@entity93 goal machine @entity18 celebrates scoring against @entity179 earlier this month @entity160 striler @entity19 and @entity180 forward @entity20 make up @entity93 's lethal attack in @entity19 , the @entity93 giants have a fine player made to look modest by comparisons with two stars			1
@entity18 is the best player in the world on current form , an astonishing athlete who has already scored three hat - tricks this season			1
if @entity24 is the greatest of all time , then @entity18 can not be too far behind			1
there were suggestions in @entity196 this season that he does not work hard enough			0
@entity198 dismissed those and has watched the £ 86m man score four and make three this season			0
he is one of the fastest men in football and at 25 is evidently getting better			2
@entity32 @entity204 and @entity30 ( right ) guided @entity32 to the @entity160 title last season @entity32 's @entity82 flier @entity209 , in action against @entity208 , is the @entity160 champions ' other attacking option winger @entity209 has not lived up to the hype following his reported £ 44m move from @entity214 in 2012 – @entity1 were keen – and his struggles were demonstrated during the first game of the season when @entity30 tore strips off him			0
@entity204 has justified his own huge price tag in a more convincing manner , scoring 25 in 43 games last season having been prolific at @entity222			0
it goes without saying that @entity30 is the star			0
at 33 , he is still magnificent			0
his five goals from five games this season takes his @entity32 ratio in all competitions to 83 in 94 games			0
he belongs in a better league			0
like @entity232 's facebook page .			0

@entity0 says @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are the best front three in world football
@entity26 will return from his ban to complete an *impressive* trio alongside @entity24 and @entity25 at @entity64
@entity18 leads the line for @entity93 alongside @entity20 and @entity19
@entity36 top @entity107 due to @entity122 , @entity126 and @entity125
