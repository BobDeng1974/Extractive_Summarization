a @entity1 woman is to face court this week for bringing her new born child to the courthouse for jury duty because she was breastfeeding			1
@entity6 , of @entity7 , delivered her daughter @entity9 in march and was breastfeeding when she was called for jury duty in august			1
she asked to be exempt from appearing , as she was breastfeeding , but received notice that she must report to court to fullfill her civic obligation and serve jury duty , according to the @entity15			1
in limbo : @entity6 was charged with contempt after bringing her newborn baby @entity9 to jury duty because she was breastfeeding			1
now she might wait a year to find out the judge 's verdict @entity6 was told to either arrange for child care or bring somebody with her who could care for the child during jury selection			1
on september 3 , she appeared for jury duty with her child , but according to the ensuing court order , she ‘ willfully and contemptuously appeared for jury service with her child and no one to care for the child ’			1
@entity6 will now face @entity35 presiding judge @entity34 on thursday at a hearing at the @entity38 downtown			1
those who skip jury duty can be found in contempt of court and ordered to pay a fine of up to $ 500 and maybe even be arrested			2
the mother insists she is not a criminal , saying ‘ i ’ve never even had a speeding ticket ’			0
before making his verdict : @entity35 presiding judge @entity34 said he would wait to see if legislators offer a jury duty exemption for breastfeeding mothers breastfeeding women are exempted from jury duty in 12 states			1
new legislation introduced by a @entity56 physician and state senator , @entity57 , would exempt breastfeeding mothers from jury duty across @entity1			2
such an exemption would help encourage more @entity1 mothers to breastfeed , said state sen. @entity57 of @entity56			0
‘ babies who are breastfed generally are healthier , are less likely to have certain health problems and will cost the state less resources , ’ said @entity57 to the @entity15			0
‘ jury duty is a roadblock to that			2
’ @entity1 statutes allow for exemptions when a juror would face ‘ an undue or extreme physical or financial hardship ’			0
' not a criminal ' : @entity6 says she has never even had a speeding ticket judge @entity34 said he has on some occasions excused potential jurors who just had a death in the family , or teachers who were scheduled to give midterm exams			1
while keeping some jurors , he often has sought to accommodate their needs , he said			0
one juror who told @entity34 he could not sit for extended periods received a seat in the back row of the jury box , where he was free to stand occasionally , even during testimony			2
some health advocates appreciate the accommodations the court makes			0
‘ providing a room for mothers to breastfeed or pump is good , and we very much encourage that , ’ said @entity93 of the @entity94 , which promotes wellness in the @entity97 area			0
court date : june 6 next year is the date set by the judge at @entity38 ( pictured ) to review the case @entity34 , while declining to discuss @entity6 ’s specific case , said breastfeeding @entity35 mothers have the option of using occasional breaks during jury service to use a private room to pump milk and store it , feeding it to their children later			1
they are also allowed to bring a caregiver to the courthouse to watch the child during trial proceedings and then take the child to a private room to breastfeed			0
but @entity6 said she has no child care options , and stays at home while @entity9 ’s father works			2
about 1,000 potential jurors report downtown every month , but the number of judges needing juries varies , and sometimes fewer jurors may be assigned to cases			0
‘ about 50 per cent are not even going to go upstairs to a case , ’ @entity34 told the @entity15			2
@entity6 is one of two breastfeeding @entity35 women who recently have faced possible penalties for not serving jury duty			1
it ’s not that she is n’t willing , she said			0
‘ the issue is the timing , ’ she said			0
‘ i just ca n’t do it right now			0
