by @entity0 two young designers have invented a folding boat which flattens into a shoulder bag - and takes its lone captain just two minutes to assemble			1
its inventors claim the vessel , which unfurls from a 5ft by 3ft sheet of plastic and is strong enough to hold two adults , could revolutionise the way people enjoy rivers , lakes and canals			1
it comes with two oars , made from the remains of the polyethylene plastic sheet which was used to make the body of the boat together with solid ash wood			0
splashing about : this boat is strong enough to hold two people - but unfolds into a flat piece of plastic ship on his shoulder : @entity29 ( pictured ) and @entity30 believe the boat could become a must - have once assembled it transforms into a rigid - hulled boat more than 7ft long and 3ft wide			1
designers @entity29 and @entity30 came up with the idea while studying at @entity36 's @entity35 and first showed off a prototype three years ago			1
mr @entity30 , from @entity36 , said : ' the idea originated from a curve folding paper workshop we did when studying at the @entity35			1
' since that workshop we have developed the idea of curve folding and trying to apply it to a bigger scale and then we decided to make a folding boat			0
' the boat is made from a single standard sheet of plastic and it only takes two minutes for one person to assemble it			0
simple : the designers tested their creation on the calm waters of @entity36 's @entity53 flat pack : the constituent parts of the boat , most of which were made from a single plastic sheet @entity60 : the contraption once it is folded into a complete boat			2
it comes with cushions to make it more comfy ' it can easily fit two people , but it is definitely more comfortable for one person			1
' it is still difficult to provide a precise selling price for our product at this stage , but we hope to make it available as soon as possible			0
' mr @entity30 said it is easy to explore city centres with the quirky boat because it is so portable			1
he added : ' the best thing about our boat is the possibility to explore cities in a different manner			0
' it is an alternative leisure activity and method for discovering the rich waterways of the city such as @entity53 in @entity36			2
' its portability provides numerous boating activities because it is light and it can easily fit into a car			2
' the creation is far from the world 's first flat - pack boat			0
last year keen canoeist and inventor @entity97 from @entity99 , @entity100 , invented the @entity101 - a canoe which can be assembled from three separate parts in just 60 seconds			0
and the 2013 @entity104 saw the unveiling of the foldable ' @entity106 ' , whose creators boasted it could also be clicked together in 60 seconds and travel at 20 knots .			0
