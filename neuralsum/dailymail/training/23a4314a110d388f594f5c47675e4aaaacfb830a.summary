transfer : @entity4 has been the subject of two separate bids from @entity7 side @entity2 ' the owners of @entity1 wish to reassure fans that their intention is not to sell @entity4 as they , along with the manager and board of directors , feel that he is integral to our bid to gain promotion back to the @entity7			1
