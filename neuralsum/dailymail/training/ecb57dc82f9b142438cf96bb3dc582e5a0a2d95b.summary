@entity1 , 38 , was 18st and size 20 *due* to overeating after her divorce
eventually decided to join a gym and met personal trainer @entity16
she helped her shed the flab in exercise classes and they became friends
also began eating healthily , *ditching* *pastries* and fatty takeaways
instead *embarked* on a diet containing high *protein* , home - cooked food
also no longer watches tv - instead , the couple go on walks in countryside
