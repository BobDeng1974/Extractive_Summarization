a father has revealed in a brutally honest interview how he came to love the daughter with @entity3 that he had tried to get his wife to abort			2
@entity5 , a pilot - turned - @entity6 agent from @entity7 , @entity8 , said that his five - year - old daughter @entity9 - one of three children - is now ' the light in the darkness ' and an inspiration to his family			1
but this was not his sentiment in 2007 when he learned his wife @entity17 was carrying a baby with @entity19 , which was totally at odds with his image of a perfect family			1
speaking to @entity24 , he explained that he had always aimed for perfection - playing for sports teams throughout college , achieving a 4.0 , enrolling in law school before coming a pilot - and the girl threatened to ruin that			1
in a brutally honest interview , he revealed how he came to love her ' my main concern was what people would think about me - what weakness inside me caused that , ' he said			2
' learning you 're having a child with @entity19 is like experiencing a death , that 's what i felt like			2
like i was getting a broken baby			0
' he explained he did everything he could to try to force @entity17 to have an abortion and , while she said he was never abusive to her , she acknowledge he was not supportive			0
she described her own turmoil that the love of her life did n't want the child that she knew she wanted so much - and she made it clear to him that it was the baby or a life without them			1
@entity9 was born on march 16 , 2007 , joining her big sister and her parents			1
but while he smiled in photographs , @entity5 said he did not feel connected to his daughter			1
he remembered how his mother commented that the little girl looked like she did n't even have @entity19 - and how he felt it was a lie			0
at odds : @entity5 explained that he had always aimed for perfection , so when his wife @entity17 , right , told him the baby had @entity3 , he did everything he could to get her to have an abortion - but she said no expecting : the couple , who already had one daughter , are pictured before @entity9 's birth in march 2007 new addition : @entity17 said the minute she began feeding @entity9 for the first time , she knew she was perfect it was only months later that he realized @entity9 was no different from any other child			1
' the turning point - i had her down and i tickled her and she laughed and giggled at me and tried to push me away , ' he remembered			0
' her laughing and smiling and reacting with me , that 's when i realized she 's just like any other kid - she 's my kid			2
' he realized that he wanted to show the world just how proud of being her father he was			1
before her birth , he had taken part in competitive races for years , but stopped when she arrived			2
he realized it was something they could do together - him running and pushing her in a special stroller			2
their first race took place just before her first birthday and they continued to achieve medals over the next five years - taking part in nine marathons as well as numerous @entity107 and 10k races			1
' it was just me and her , nothing between us , ' @entity5 said			2
' looking back on the pictures of running with her , that 's a good memory			0
' inner battle : he said he immediately saw his daughter had downs and could not bond with her realization : but he said when she was a few months old , he tickled her and she laughed and pushed back - and he realized she was like every other kid			1
' she 's my kid , ' he said happy together : he said he wanted to show how proud he was of his daughter so came up with a plan footage from the races shows @entity9 giggling with glee and waving to spectators - or simply sitting back an enjoying the ride - as her father carries them to the finish line			1
as she turns five , he has now decided to let her run for herself - and knows she will have no problem doing so			0
together , they ran 321 miles in races - which is significant as @entity3 is the 3rd copy of the 21 chromosome			2
the couple went on to have another girl and are again pregnant - with their fourth daughter			0
when @entity9 was 18 months old , @entity5 began writing a letter to @entity9 , he shared with @entity24 , detailing his conflicted feelings about her birth and how he now loves her beyond words			1
he said that , while he knows the letter could upset her in the future , he hopes it also shows her just how much he loves her - and that it tells other worried parents that they are not alone			0
team : for years , they ran marathons and road races together , with @entity5 proudly pushing @entity9 @entity153 : he said that when she was five , he realized she no longer needed him to carry her places big sister : @entity9 is pictured with her two sisters			1
the family is now expecting a fourth girl ' nobody knew the way i felt before she was born , and if i can keep one family , one person from having to live with the guilt and almost making the mistake that i almost made , it 's going to be worth the pain that @entity9 will feel later in life knowing the way that i felt , ' he said			1
he added that while he has not read the letter to her yet , he does plan to			0
' it was just my way of repenting , ' he said			0
' chances are that she never would have known the way i felt before she was born			0
that could have been my dirty secret that i kept with me forever			0
' but i did n't want it to be a secret , i wanted her to know that she was everything to me ... my love for @entity9 is perfect			1
' @entity181 also spoke of the change she had seen in her husband			0
' @entity184 had said , " i do n't want to take care of somebody for the rest of my life " , ' she told @entity24			0
' i think now he looks at it and says , " oh my goodness , i may not get to take care of her the rest of her life "			0
' see below for video			0

@entity5 , a pilot and @entity6 agent , said he had always sought perfection - and a down *syndrome* child did not fit into that picture
but his wife *refused* to have an abortion and @entity9 was born in 2007
a few months later , he was making her laugh and he realized she was just like every other child - apart from that she was his
he wanted to show how proud he was of her so they began taking part in marathons and road races together
