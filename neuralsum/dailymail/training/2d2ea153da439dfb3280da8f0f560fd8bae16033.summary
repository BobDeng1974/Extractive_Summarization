by @entity0 published : 09:52 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 12:38 est , 16 may 2013 mapping site @entity1 has created an interactive cloudless atlas using two year 's worth of images taken by @entity7 satellites			1
more than 339,000 images were collected from @entity7 's @entity9 ( @entity11 ) technology , which orbits the @entity12 attached to satellites			1
cartographers from @entity1 then sorted through the images , pixel - by - pixel , finding images taken on cloudless summer days and layered them on top of each other to create the atlas			1
a clear image of the @entity24 taken from @entity1 's cloudless atlas			1
@entity1 used data collected by @entity7 's @entity11 satellite that orbits the @entity28 and captures images of the entire planet every two days			1
densely populated cities such as @entity32 can be seen , as can the @entity33 in @entity34 , and the highlands in @entity36 cartographers at the open - source company then sifted through the images to remove the clouds and haze caused by the atmosphere to get a clear shot of the ground			1
traditionally , these images would then be sewn together but this method can leave visible seams in the map and images next to each might come from different days , so the images would tie up exactly			2
to solve this problem , @entity1 took all the images of an area and put them one on top of the other			1
the columns of pixels are then reordered based on how cloudy each one showed that area to be			0
the team did this for every pixel in the world			2
@entity1 starts with the data captured by @entity11 system , which can image the entire @entity12 every one to two days			2
according to @entity71 , a @entity1 data analyst : ' one of the first sorting processes we had is that we came up with a plan to obtain images from the summer in the northern and southern hemispheres			1
' we only downloaded images from certain dates and from certain locations			0
' the @entity11 system is attached to a pair of satellites called @entity82 and @entity83 which were launched into orbit in 1999 and 2002 respectively			0
the satellites and the @entity11 system images can collect data using the visual field wavelength			2
once @entity1 selected the data it wanted , the relevant images were moved from @entity7 's servers to @entity1 's			1
speaking before the launch , @entity1 cartographer @entity92 said : ' for the new release we ’re processing two years of imagery , captured from january 1 , 2011 through december 31 , 2012			2
' this amounts to over 339,000 16 - megapixel + satellite images , totaling more than 5,687,476,224,000 pixels			1
' we boil these down to a mere 5 billion or so			0
' cloudless atlas shot of the @entity101 and @entity102 near @entity103			1
the image shows the natural colours of the @entity103 tundra			0
the word tundra usually refers to places where the soil is permanently frozen			0
@entity103 's tundra is an example of this permafrost tundra , and there is another in northern @entity114 the southern coast of @entity117 with the @entity115 visible in the southwest			0
@entity7 's @entity11 technology orbits the @entity28 on its @entity82 and @entity83 satellites taking images of the @entity12			1
it can capture the entire planet every two days @entity7 's @entity11 satellites take images of the entire planet every two days			1
this picture shows what the images look like when stitched together			0
they include clouds , atmosphere haze and glints of sunshine			0
@entity1 had to remove all of these elements to create its cloudless atlas			1
it did this by layering individual pixels from cloudless days around the world on top of each other cartographers at the open - source company then sifted through the images to remove the clouds in order to get a clear shot of the ground			1
traditionally , these images would then be sewn together but , according to @entity92 , this method can leave visible seams in the map			2
images next to each other might also come from different days , so the images would n't tie up exactly			0
to solve this problem , @entity1 took all the images of an area and put them one on top of the other			2
this image , taken from @entity1 's cloudless atlas , shows @entity162 on a clear day			1
the red areas show the desert in the @entity165			0
the green sections show forests and areas that get a higher proportion of rain			0
the map was put together using images taken by @entity7 's imaging technology @entity11 the ' boot ' of @entity175 is seen in this image from @entity1 's cloudless atlas , with @entity177 and @entity178 also visible			1
more than 339,000 images were taken from two year 's worth of @entity7 satellite imagery to create the seamless online map the columns of pixels were then reordered based on how cloudy each one showed that area to be			1
@entity92 's team did this for every pixel in the world			2
@entity1 co-founder and ceo , @entity193 said : ' what we ’re talking about [ is the ] most beautiful world mosaic ever made			2
' we ’ve been able to literally make clouds go away in a way that ’s never been done			0
@entity199 , on the coast , and @entity201 , shown further inland , feature in this @entity1 image			2
the geology of @entity199 contains many rocks from the @entity208 age , dating back 541 million years some of the images on the cloudless atlas have never been seen clearly before			1
one example is the island of @entity213 , pictured			0
@entity213 is covered in clouds almost all year round so it 's been previously difficult to get such a cloud - free image this image shows the the @entity219 green area is a fertile region of land , surrounded by unfertile , dry regions			2
almost half of @entity225 's population live in the delta			0
@entity1 's @entity92 said the area is under threat from rising sea levels ' you can see land - use patterns , deforestation , cities - it ’s incredible			1
' the images from the cloudless atlas give an idea of what astronauts on board the @entity238 can see on a clear day			1
until recently , @entity1 ’s maps were created using @entity244 data			2
people could then modify these maps and add data using the open - source design software @entity248			0
some areas of @entity12 are covered in clouds almost all year round meaning traditional satellite imagery is obscured			0
such areas , including the island of @entity213 , have never been seen as clearly before as they are on @entity1 's cloudless atlas			1
@entity1 released its first satellite images in december last year , and this latest release takes the layer a step further			1
@entity261 in south - central @entity117 is the home of the @entity262 , pictured in the centre of this @entity1 cloudless atlas image			1
the delta is where the @entity266 reaches a trough created by the location of the tectonic plates , which the continent sits on			0
all the water that reaches the delta is evaporated so never makes it to the sea the northern coast of @entity277			0
the @entity278 - a large area of volcanic rock - were formed by a volcanic eruption about 200 million years ago			0
the eruptions continued for a million years and killed 90 % of the population only the most densely populated regions can be seen from space			0
the majority ca n't be seen without zooming in			0
this shot shows the @entity114 city of @entity289			0
@entity289 is what 's called a ' megacity ' and it is the most populous city in @entity292 , as well as the 6th largest city in the world @entity295 : @entity296			0

@entity1 used two year 's worth of images taken by @entity7 satellites to create the cloudless atlas
cartographers searched through 339,000 images , pixel - by - pixel to create the seamless , *searchable* map
