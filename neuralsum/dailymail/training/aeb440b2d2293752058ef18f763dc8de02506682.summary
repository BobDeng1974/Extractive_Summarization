by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 25 november 2012 updated : 07:47 est , 25 november 2012 technological revolution : health secretary @entity2 believes plans to conduct doctor 's appointments via @entity6 or over the phone will save the @entity8 £ 3bn plans to replace face - to - face doctor 's surgery appointments with treatment over the phone or via computer weblink will put lives at risk , ministers and campaigners have warned			1
the new system of ' virtual clinics ' favoured by health secretary @entity2 could spell the end of traditional doctor 's surgeries with appointments conducted on @entity24 and @entity6 , and test results delivered by text message			1
the @entity27 reported that @entity8 bosses are importing the idea from @entity30 and believe the changes would cut £ 2.9bn almost immediately , a good chunk of the £ 20bn the @entity8 must save to fill its funding gap			1
however , critics say the plans would create a two - tier health service , where those who are less technologically able - particularly the elderly - would be left behind , and the trust between doctor and patient eroded			2
the ideas were outlined by health minister @entity40 last week and are contained in a @entity42 report called ' @entity43			0
' it proposes supplying community nurses with @entity24 in rural areas and making more use of @entity6 video calling between gps and patients			2
health assessments would be completed online and ' augmented ' with video calls			2
mobile phone ' apps ' would be used by doctors to access lab reports and health records , while negative test results would be sent to patients by text message rather than delivered in person			1
health chiefs believe the new system would reduce ' needless ' appointments that take up too much staff time			0
the report says that every one per cent reduction in face - to - face appointments will save the health service £ 200m			1
shadow health secretary @entity69 labelled the plans ' dangerous ' , while charities and campaign groups expressed concerns			0
the @entity75 shadow minister said : ' older people who do n't have access to the internet will lose out			0
' backing the change : conservative mp dr @entity40 unveiled the plans for a digital future in parliament this week ' dangerous ' : shadow health secretary @entity69 branded the reforms ' dangerous ' and said older patients would miss out on the care they needed ' it also gives the medical professional the chance to recognise health issues that may not be obvious from a distance			0
' @entity91 , chief executive of the @entity92 , said : ' the telehealth agenda must be driven by a desire to improve clinical outcomes and patient care , not the government 's plans to save £ 20bn			1
' speaking in a @entity101 debate last week , dr @entity40 argued that treating patients with modern technology in their own homes would help to free up in - patient beds and reduce waiting times			2
' we have to harness and better utilise more modern types of technology such as telehealth and mobile technology to support people better in their own homes and to drive down the cost of care , ' he said			0
@entity116 charity director @entity115 said : ' many people of all ages still prefer human contact			0
dr @entity40 told the @entity120 : ' we want to make life easier for patients			0
by allowing people to access the @entity8 online , we will help put an end to things like the 8am rush to phone your gp to try and book a medical appointment , and we are using the internet and medical technology to better support people with long term health conditions like diabetes , dementia and heart disease to be better looked after and supported in their own homes and communities			1
' however , it is important to stress that patients who are unwell and need to see their gp will still always have quality face - to - face time with them			1
' the government also recognises that not everyone , particularly frail older people , will have easy access to the internet , which is why the momentum for these improvements in care will be locally - led and will involve working closely with charities like @entity116 in order to support people and their carers in better accessing medical technology and the internet			0

many face - to - face appointments would be replaced by phone or weblink treatment
online forms would be completed via @entity24 and negative test results delivered by text message
doctors would use a mobile app to access patient records
ministers say the plans will save the @entity8 £ 3bn ' immediately '
but campaigners say lives could be put at risk
