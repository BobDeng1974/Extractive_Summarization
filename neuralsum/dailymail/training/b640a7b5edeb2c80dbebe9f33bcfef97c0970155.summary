the model whose multimillionaire husband hired a hit man to kill her has revealed she still fears he will come back into her life			1
@entity6 was jailed for nine years in june 2014 for plotting the murder of @entity8 , his wife of almost a decade and mother of his two daughters			1
the lengthy court case in @entity12 heard recorded phone calls in which @entity6 , a vitamin tycoon whose business greatly benefited from his wife 's skin care line , said he was ' 100 per cent ' sure he wanted @entity8 dead			1
now , half a year later , @entity8 tells 48 hours : ' i know his intention is to reunite himself with the kids and take those children away from me			1
' do i think about it ? yes			0
like i had been kidnapped in @entity40			0
he wanted me raped , and he wanted my head cut off			1
' it 's the @entity43 ; it 's kill or be killed			2
' but in a phone call from prison , @entity6 told the documentary he is the victim			1
' i 've been criminalized , @entity47 , ' he told 48 hours reporter @entity48			0
' it 's just destroyed my life			0
and i do n't get it , i do n't understand why everyone wants to attack me , and this guy set me up			2
' @entity6 was ultimately sentenced after the court was played phone calls between him and his hired hit man @entity30 , who went to the police			1
shocked that @entity6 ' had it all ' and still wanted to commit such an act , @entity30 says he deliberately stalled the operation - even pretended he had infected @entity8 with @entity61			1
he said @entity6 was constantly dating other women and contacted him when the marriage started to break down			2
@entity30 told the program : ' he wanted her dead and he did n't care how it was done - beat her up , cut her head off , put her in ditch			1
' instead he handed in his recorded messages to the district attorney			0
' happy family ' : the couple had two daughters and a seemingly blissful life before it broke down plot : @entity6 , who the court heard was consistently unfaithful , hired @entity30 to kill @entity8 one included : @entity30 : ' you 're positive ? ' @entity6 : ' that what ? ' @entity30 : ' you want her dead ? ' @entity6 : ' oh , i 'm ... ' @entity30 : ' 100 percent ? ' @entity6 : ' why would n't i ? ' @entity30 : ' why would n't you ? good question			1
' according to @entity8 , @entity6 's mood started to change when she tried to start her own skin care line - which was ultimately a success - for he wanted her to stay at home			1
' @entity87 is lucky because , in the end , @entity30 is not a killer			0
he is someone that might bend the truth or omit the truth , but he 's not a killer			0
and that 's what saved @entity8 , ' said @entity12 assistant district attorney @entity96			2
despite the guilty verdict , which @entity6 is unable to appeal , two of @entity6 's six older brothers are determined to defend their sibling - slamming a recorded phone call between @entity6 and the hit man as unconvincing			1
career woman : @entity8 , a model with a degree in international business , said her husband 's mood changed tearful : in court at her husband 's sentencing @entity8 wept as she described her shock speaking to 48 hours , @entity114 and @entity115 dismissed their former sister - in - law as a ' gold digger ' and said they were unconvinced by the evidence heard in @entity121			1
' i really did n't think anybody was going to be dead , ' @entity114 insists , slamming a tape which purported to show @entity6 dealing with the hit man as flimsy proof			1
@entity115 says of @entity8 : ' i did n't care for her			2
i thought she was a gold - digger , and had other motives			0
' the brothers , who grew up on a @entity131 farm , describe @entity8 as a trophy wife			2
@entity114 said : ' she wanted her lifestyle that was n't sitting at home			0
you know , her lifestyle was to go to @entity136 , and whatever they do in @entity136			0
' they had nannies ... people with the girls , you know , all day long			0
... so he 's probably spent more time with ' em. because when he 'd come home from work , sometimes she would n't come back ... until later in the evening			0
' unconvinced : @entity115 believes his younger brother 's ex-wife @entity8 was a ' gold digger ' last year , the brothers filed character testimonies to court for @entity6 , saying that he started his working life in 1984 sweeping factory floors before rising through the ranks to become an office manager in just three years			1
he studied for a business degree in his spare time before spending seven years as an executive for a waste disposal company			0
they said he cashed in $ 130,000 worth of stock he 'd acquired in the company to start his own beauty supplements business creation 's garden			0
at it 's height , the firm employed 250 people , had four factories and made $ 48 million a year			0
one of the most successful lines was @entity8 's skin care brand			2
but immediately after his arrest , @entity6 gave his brother @entity114 power of attorney and filed for bankruptcy citing debts of just over $ 1 million			2
the firm , whose assets included $ 8 million worth of stock , was eventually sold off at auction .			0
