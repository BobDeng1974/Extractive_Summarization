by @entity0 last updated at 3:56 pm on 29th october 2011 as @entity3 officials flew to @entity4 to beg for financial help last night , @entity1 was accused of allowing @entity8 to ‘ buy @entity7 ’s silence ’ over its appalling human rights record			1
campaigners spoke out after the head of @entity7 ’s bailout fund arrived in the @entity8 capital to discuss the terms on which the hardline regime might agree to inject billions into the struggling eurozone countries			1
campaigners fear @entity3 negotiators will cave in to @entity8 demands to tone down criticism of the regime ’s human rights record			1
' buying silence ' : as @entity3 chief executive of financial stability @entity26 ( left ) flies into @entity8 questions are raised about what @entity28 will demand in return experts believe @entity4 will also press for the lifting of a long - standing @entity34 arms embargo and demand preferential trade terms			1
@entity36 , campaigns director at @entity37 , warned there was a real danger that @entity4 would exploit @entity7 ’s weakness for its own ends			2
he said : ‘ human rights concerns must not be traded away in return for @entity8 assistance in the euro crisis			1
‘ in particular , speculation about a possible lifting of the ban on @entity3 arms sales to @entity8 is extremely worrying , especially in the context of an ongoing crackdown on dissent and criticism there			1
' @entity7 's silence ' : as the head of @entity7 's bailout fund arrived in @entity4 campaigners are questioning the price of any possible bailout ‘ @entity8 must not be allowed to buy silence from @entity7			1
if our silence on human rights issues is at stake , then that is too big a price for @entity7 and for @entity8 ’s citizens to have to pay			1
’ the warning came as @entity26 , chief executive of the @entity69 , began a humiliating mission to @entity8 to ask for financial aid			1
his visit follows a pledge by @entity75 president @entity74 to lobby his counterpart @entity28 directly over the issue			0
@entity8 , which has a £ 2.1trillion cash reserve , is seen as one of the few countries capable of shoring up the struggling euro			1
the visit follows @entity75 president @entity74 lobbying @entity28 over a possible bail out officials believe @entity4 might be persuaded to stump up £ 60billion to bolster the new euro bailout fund designed to support the struggling economies of @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
mr @entity26 said he was holding consultations to decide the terms for raising the money and was not yet at the point of detailed negotiations on a deal			0
he said : ‘ do n’t expect any precise outcome of our talks			0
i can not say today , and it ’s certainly far too early to say what kind of amounts might be envisaged			2
' joining a bailout could help @entity8 establish itself as one of the elite governments that helps manage the world economy			2
@entity8 is said to be keen to see the euro survive as a counterbalance to the dollar			2
but @entity4 was badly burned by losses made on investments in the @entity111 in the 2008 crash , and is expected to demand firm guarantees that it will not suffer a repeat if it agrees to shore up @entity7			0
the @entity8 are also pressing for formal recognition by the @entity3 that they now operate a ‘ market economy ’			1
this would make it far harder to take retaliatory action against the dumping of cheap @entity8 goods in this country			2
professor @entity124 , a @entity8 expert at @entity125 , said @entity8 had a long record of securing demands in return for cash			1
he said @entity4 ’s key demands were likely to be economic			2
but he added : ‘ they do n’t like being lectured on human rights and although they can get arms from @entity136 and @entity137 , they do n’t like the arms embargo because they feel it puts them in the same category as regimes like @entity143 and @entity144			1
’ however , professor @entity124 warned that any move to bail out @entity7 would be controversial within @entity8 , where poverty is still rife , particularly in rural areas			2
@entity149 , a member of @entity8 ’s @entity151 monetary committee , warned on thursday that @entity8 would not throw money into parts of the @entity3 economy deemed a lost cause			1
he said : ‘ the last thing @entity8 wants is to throw away the country ’s wealth and be seen as just a source of dumb money			1
’ by @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 @entity164 : there is growing resentment among @entity168 mps over his heavy - handed tactics @entity164 ’s support among women is slipping away , with just 43 per cent saying that they approve of the prime minister			2
a @entity175 survey for the @entity176 has revealed a growing divide between the sexes , with 54 per cent of men saying that mr @entity164 is doing a good job			0
the figures will fuel fears among senior @entity183 that the @entity184 , and mr @entity164 in particular , has a ‘ woman problem ’			0
most worryingly for the prime minister is that half of all women between 45 and 54 said they thought the prime minister was doing a bad job			0
the survey follows a poll earlier in the month which found that one in four voters believe mr @entity164 ’s attitude to women is ‘ sexist ’			0
@entity168 strategists are concerned that the @entity184 ’s cuts are seen as particularly harmful to women , with recent figures showing that the number of unemployed women has reached a million			0
mr @entity164 ’s standing with women has not been helped by controversial calls from his policy guru @entity206 to scrap maternity pay			0
a leaked report of the @entity210 report , commissioned by the pm , is said to suggest that mr @entity164 scale back on his pledges to extend flexible working rights			0
