by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:27 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 3 january 2013 @entity2 said he is ' pleased ' with how things were going despite the confusion @entity6 voters will be the hardest hit when child benefit is axed for higher earners			1
figures obtained by the @entity11 reveal that the @entity6 heartlands in the @entity13 will be the biggest losers when the changes come into force on monday			0
nine of the top ten constituencies where most letters have been sent out warning that families will lose the benefit are in conservative safe seats in @entity23 and the @entity24			2
the revelations will reinforce the concerns of some @entity6 @entity27 that the government is gratuitously offending its own supporters with the raid on child benefit			1
yesterday , the @entity32 admitted more than 300,000 taxpayers – out of an estimated 1.2million who are affected – have not yet been informed by @entity36 that they are set to lose out			1
despite the confusion , treasury minister @entity2 insisted he was pleased with the way things were unfolding			1
he insisted there is no obligation to contact people and said they could always get the information from the @entity36 website instead			0
the @entity32 has sent out 750,000 warning letters to families saying they could be affected by the cut and warning them that they have to complete a self - assessment tax form			1
but with just days to go before changes to the system on january 7 , only 182,199 of those affected have opted out of receiving the benefit altogether , rather than fill in self - assessment forms			0
yet mr @entity2 , @entity2 secretary to the treasury , told @entity57 that this was a ‘ good response ’ and ‘ slightly more ’ than expected			2
he said : ‘ so far we are getting a good response – slightly more people have opted out of child benefit than we had expected and that suggests the message is getting across even though not everyone will have got a letter			2
’ but another 316,000 families , where one parent earns at least £ 50,000 , may have no idea that they will be stripped of part or all of the benefit			1
at present , all parents with young children are given the benefit worth £ 20.30 a week for the first child and £ 13.40 for each subsequent child			2
for a couple with two children , it is worth £ 1,752 a year			0
but from sunday , families where one parent earns between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000 will have the handout reduced			1
families where one parent earns more than £ 60,000 will lose the benefit entirely			1
unless parents opt to stop receiving the benefit entirely , those losing all or part of it will have to fill in a tax form			0
of the 750,000 letters sent out the most – 169,000 – went to households in the @entity13 , with another 132,000 to homes in @entity23 , 92,000 to families in the @entity98 and 62,000 to households in the @entity100			0
at the other end of the scale , just 13,600 were sent to homes in @entity104 and 18,000 in the @entity105			0
two of the top ten constituencies with most people hit by the child benefit cut are home to @entity6 cabinet ministers , health secretary @entity112 in @entity113 and home secretary @entity114 in @entity115			1
the constituencies of @entity112 and @entity114 are among those that will be most hit by the cut the only @entity120 seat in the top ten is @entity122 , held by @entity124 business secretary @entity123			0
the first constituency outside the south of @entity128 to appear on the list of 651 constituencies , in 30th place , is @entity131 , near @entity132 , which saw 3,080 letters delivered			0
at the bottom of the list is @entity137 , where just 110 homes received letters			0
speaking about the households who have not yet received letters , mr @entity2 said @entity36 does not have the information necessary to contact people whose circumstances have changed over the past year			2
@entity146 said one third of recipients who will lose out on child benefit will not be told and will get a ' horrible surprise ' the minister , who has previously accused critics of the child benefit cut of ‘ fiscal nimbyism ’ , added : ‘ @entity36 does n’t normally write to everybody , every time there is a tax change that affects them			1
if people have n’t received a letter , that does n’t mean they ca n’t visit the @entity36 website			0
‘ after sunday , if people have n’t opted out then they ’ll need to make sure they are in the self - assessment system			0
’ a @entity32 spokesman insisted the cuts were necessary , adding : ‘ we have always been clear those with the broadest shoulders should carry the greatest burden when it comes to balancing the nation ’s books			2
‘ those liable for the removal of child benefit fall in the top 15 per cent of earners and nearly half of the households affected by this change have a household income of more than £ 100,000			1
’ but @entity182 business spokesman described it as ‘ extraordinary ’ that a third of current child benefit recipients who will lose out this year will not be informed by @entity36 and are ‘ going to get a horrible surprise ’			2
he added : ‘ you ’ve still got this ridiculous situation where if you are a one - earner family where one person is earning £ 50,000 you lose all of your child benefit , but if you ’re a two - earner family where each of you is earning , say , £ 40,000 , a combined income of £ 80,000 , you get to keep your child benefit			1
this is an extraordinary state of affairs			0

families with one parent earning more than £ 60,000 will lose child benefit
those with one earner of £ 50,000 will see cut in the benefit from sunday
@entity6 voters will be the hardest hit by the changes
@entity32 admits 300,000 people have not yet been told they will be affected
but treasury minister @entity2 insisted he was pleased with *progress*
