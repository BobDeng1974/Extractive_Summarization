by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 02:48 est , 26 october 2012 a @entity2 pensioner hit the jackpot at his local fleamarket when a $ 25 book of old stamps contained a single rare specimen which he believes is worth an incredible $ 3 million			1
@entity8 , 70 , wants to fly to experts in @entity10 with the one cent stamp dating from 1861 and bearing the portrait of @entity13			1
only 3,100 of them were ever printed during the @entity15 and stayed in use until 1867			1
@entity8 , from @entity17 , said it was actually his partner @entity19 , 71 , who bought the book containing 4lbs of stamps			1
@entity2 pensioner @entity8 , with the @entity10 one cent stamp he believes could be worth $ 3million ' when i laid them out on the table and saw the one cent stamp i stopped breathing , ' he said			1
' since then i have shown it to experts and consulted all the literature i can find about it			2
there is only one other example known about , in a @entity33 museum , and dealers have told me it is worth at least three million @entity10 dollars			2
' rare @entity10 stamp dealer @entity36 from @entity37 told a @entity2 newspaper ; ' a certificate of authenticity can be issued in this case only by the @entity42 in @entity33			1
' mr @entity8 discovered the rare specimen at a @entity17 flea market but @entity8 , who lives from a $ 750 a month pension , does n't have the money to fly to @entity10			1
he is offering anyone who sponsors him on his trip the money in full plus interest - and has put down another album of not - so - rare stamps in his possession valued at $ 25,000 as security			1
minor differences in the most minute details , such has variations in paper and the types of ink used can have a dramatic effect on the value of stamp			0
while some one cent stamps from the civil war era are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars or more , others can change hands for around $ 20			2
the most highly - prized of all the one cent stamps is the 1868 ' z ' grill - the grill being a pattern of tiny squares embossed into the paper and visible on the back			2
the ' z grill ' was introduced as it allowed ink to be fully absorbed into the paper and stop cheapskates from washing their stamps clean and reusing them			0
but they were found to be impractical and quickly discontinued			0
there are only two known 1968 z - grills in existence one of which fetched $ 930,000 when it was sold in 1988			1
the world 's most valuable object by weight : the @entity90 @entity89 in 2010 , a @entity90 ' @entity89 ' broke the record for the most expensive stamp ever sold			0
it is believed that the rectangular treasure went for £ 1.6million , though it has never been confirmed			0
the world 's most valuable object by weight , the first owner is said to have been a @entity90 schoolboy , who found it in 1885 among a pile of letters left by his grandparents			0
the @entity89 is ' one of about a half dozen highly notorious stamps in the world , ' according to noted @entity10 stamp expert @entity106			0
others include the 1856 @entity108 1 cent @entity109 which has been locked away in a vault since 1980 when it was bought for nearly one million @entity10 dollars by chemicals fortune heir @entity111			0
another is the 2 @entity115 that sold for £ 970,000 in 1993 , it was one of the first stamps issued by the @entity108 colonial government			0
a series of rare @entity121 stamps known as the ' @entity122 ' which were printed from 1851 are also highly prized			1
they get their name from the fact they were used by @entity10 missionaries on the islands to send letters back to the continental @entity10			0
a two cent @entity130 is valued at about $ 760,000 in unused condition .			2
