life after @entity1 did n't start well for @entity2 after they were humiliated 5 - 0 by @entity3 at the @entity4			1
@entity5 and @entity6 both scored first half braces before @entity8 added a fifth as @entity10 's side capitulated in worrying fashion			1
here , @entity12 gives their player ratings			0
@entity2 's players look dejected during a first - half performance that saw them concede four times @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity17 - 5 a good save to deny @entity19 in the second half and not directly implicated for any of the goals , but how much positive feedback can you take from a 5 - 0 defeat ? @entity25 - 4 never got close to controlling @entity19			1
@entity26 - 4 horrendous backpass for @entity3 ’s third			1
the low point of a poor performance			0
@entity31 - 4.5 won headers and fought hard but failed to lift or organise an outclassed defence			2
@entity31 attempts to block @entity5 's shot but it evades both him and @entity17 and goes in @entity35 - 4.5 part of a poor defensive unit			1
could have been stronger in the tackle in the build up to @entity3 ’s fifth			1
@entity40 - 4 barely got a sniff of the ball			1
@entity43 - 4 got tangled up in first - goal mess and over-run thereafter			1

former @entity54 winger @entity53 tries to protect the ball from @entity2 defender @entity35 @entity56 - 5.5 lacked service before injuring his calf while misplaying a pass after 32 minutes			1
@entity60 - 4.5 loan signing looked quick but generally ineffective			2
came short to try to find possession but @entity2 could n’t hold on to ball long enough to supply it			1
@entity64 - 5 he will have easier games in his effort to prove himself as a replacement for @entity1			2
tried hard but with no service what can you do ? subs : @entity72 for @entity56 ( 32 , 5.5 ) , @entity73 for @entity60 ( 66 , 5 ) , @entity74 for @entity40 ( 74 )			0
not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78			0
@entity10 - 4 two men up front meant an overrun midfield			1
that said , not sure a wall would have kept @entity3 out			2
@entity60 dribbles with the ball while being closed down by @entity3 midfielder @entity85 the @entity3 players celebrate during the first half - during which they managed to score four goals @entity3 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity90 - 6 poor guy has n’t had much playing time this season so you have to feel for him when he gets a game but nothing to do			1
@entity97 - 6.5 nothing to do defensively but , as always , a surging presence down the right flank			0
hard as nails and subtle when he needed to be , such as the touch and pass to create @entity3 ’s fifth			2
@entity104 - 6 won a couple of first - half headers and sat back and enjoyed the game			2
@entity108 - 6 see @entity104			0
former @entity110 and @entity111 midfielder @entity109 is challenged by @entity60 during the second half @entity113 - 6 got forward well but not much to do defensively			2
@entity85 - 7 along with @entity109 , he controlled the middle of the pitch , which is where the match was won			0
@entity109 - 7.5 all roads pass through him – he sets the tempo and plots the routes			0
big part of the group that made the second			0
@entity53 - 7.5 always moving , often incisive and helped make the fourth with lovely run and shot			0
two efforts against the woodwork			0
@entity3 's @entity131 midfielder @entity5 fires in the opening goal of the game at the @entity4 on saturday @entity5 - 8.5 lovely finish from 25 yards for first and equally clinical for second			1
the creative spark of a wonderfully impressive performance			0
@entity19 - 7 forced save after 19 minutes and teed up good chance for @entity109 early in second half			2
effective without being the main threat			0
