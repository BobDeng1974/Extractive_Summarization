next week a ‘ blood moon ’ will be visible across large parts of parts of @entity2			1
on wednesday morning at 6:25am eastern time the moon will pass into @entity6 ’s shadow , making it appear red			1
the event will last about an hour and , owing to the moon ’s position in its orbit , will be 5.3 per cent larger than the previous blood moon on 15 april			1
a red moon will be visible in parts of the world including the @entity15 next week			1
the event is known as a ' blood moon ' ( stock image shown ) owing to the red colour of the moon			1
it occurs when the moon passes in to the shadow of @entity6 called the umbra the event is the second in a sequence of four blood moons called a tetrad , which occur in six - month intervals			1
the next will happen on 4 april 2015 and the last on 28 september 2015			1
for the latest blood moon the moment of greatest eclipse will occur at 6:54am eastern time , after starting at 6:25am , while the eclipse lasts a total of 59 minutes - ending at 7:53am			1
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity6			1
this is an area known as the umbra , where light from the @entity43 is blocked by our planet			0
the light refracts differently in the atmosphere and , as it hits the moon , it makes it appear red			0
this gives rise to its ‘ blood red ’ appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow			2
if it skirts the shadow , known as a partial or penumbral eclipse , the effect is less dramatic			0
owing to the orientation of the moon the southern half will appear much darker than the northern half because it will lie deeper in @entity6 ’s shadow			2
it will be most visible in the northwestern third of @entity2 , where all stages can be witnessed			0
farther east in the @entity15 , various phases will occur after moonset			0
none of the eclipse will be visible from @entity69 , @entity70 or the @entity71 though			0
it 's not often that we get a chance to see our planet 's shadow , but a lunar eclipse gives us a brief glimpse			0
during these rare events , the full moon rapidly darkens and then glows red it will be most visible in the northwestern third of @entity2 ( illustration shown ) , where all stages can be witnessed			2
farther east in the @entity15 , various phases will occur after moonset			0
none of the eclipse will be visible from @entity69 , @entity70 or the @entity71 though at the eclipse 's peak the moon will enter the @entity6 's full shadow , the umbra			1
at this stage , the @entity6 's atmosphere will scatter the sun 's red visible light , the same process that turns the sky red at sunset			2
as a result , the red light will reflect off the moon 's surface , casting a reddish rust hue over it			0
although there are four lunar eclipses in fairly close proximity , the event is not that common			0
on average there are two eclipses a year but some are penumbral - which means the moon only passes through the outer portion of @entity6 ’s shadow - so the effect is much less noticeable			2
and other eclipses see just a shadow cast on the moon with no red effect			0
this ‘ blood ’ appearance comes from the refraction of the sun ’s light through @entity6 ’s atmosphere – much like what is seen at a sunset or sunrise			0
eclipses do not follow any particular pattern though , so getting four ‘ blood moons ’ in a row is rare			2

the ‘ blood ’ appearance comes from the refraction of the sun ’s light through @entity6 ’s atmosphere when the sun , @entity6 and moon are lined up ( illustrated )			2
