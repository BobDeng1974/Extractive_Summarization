for nearly a decade , @entity0 believed her husband had been killed on impact when @entity3 smashed into the @entity4 on september 11 , 2001			1
but last year , just weeks before the 10 - year anniversary of the horrific attack , she received a call that changed her life - and the story of her husband 's death			1
a note in his handwriting and with a smudge of his blood had been found , reading : ' 84th floor			1
it also shows a smudge of his blood			2
his family thought he had died on impact the note had drifted to the ground outside the building just moments before it collapsed - and left @entity21 's wife and three children horrified that he had been alive to experience fear			1
' i spent 10 years hoping that @entity21 was n't trapped in that building , ' @entity0 , 57 , told the @entity39 from her @entity40 , @entity41 home			1
' you do n't want them to suffer			2
they 're trapped in a burning building			1
it 's just an unspeakable horror			0
and then you get this 10 years later			1
' @entity21 , 48 , worked at @entity49 in the @entity4 when he phoned the school where his wife taught to let her know that one of the @entity4 had been hit by a plane			1
heartbreaking discovery : @entity21 's wife @entity0 , left , and two of his three daughters , @entity58 , centre , and @entity60 , right , say they were stunned the note had made its way to them missed : the @entity21 family poses together before @entity21 's death in the terrorist attacks on the @entity4 believing the first crash was minor , he asked to pass on the message that he was fine - and she only discovered the full horror when her daughter @entity58 called from college later that morning			1
loss : @entity21 , 48 , perished with his co-workers and thousands of others when the towers collapsed in the days after the attacks , @entity0 and her three daughters checked bars , restaurants and hospitals for their husband and father , the @entity39 reported			1
nearly 10 years later , in august 2011 , @entity0 received a call from dr. @entity83 , chief of staff and director of forensic investigations at the @entity85 of @entity86			1
aware that the office called families if they came across fragments of victims , @entity0 asked what it was they had found			2
' she said , " no , it 's not a fragment			0
it 's something written " , ' @entity0 said			0
' and that 's when i just fell apart			0
' the note had been found on the street amid the chaos on 9/11 and handed to a guard at the @entity101			1
as he reached for his radio to alert help , the tower crumbled			1
the @entity101 kept the note and eventually turned it over to the @entity107 , which worked with the medical examiner 's office			2
it was linked to @entity21 after a medical examiner carried out dna tests on a dark spot on the note , and discovered it was @entity21 's blood			1
after taking the phone call from the @entity116 's office , @entity0 travelled to @entity86 with @entity21 's best friend to see the note			1
' the minute i saw it i did n't need to see the dna test , ' she said			2
' i saw the handwriting			0
it 's @entity21 's handwriting			1
' shock : the women said they never wanted to believe he had been trapped or suffered in the building she added : ' i 'm speechless that they actually were able to identify it			1
this note was written on september 11			2
it came out of a window			0
people had their hands all over it			2
' @entity83 from the @entity116 's office asked if the museum could exhibit the letter and @entity0 agreed - but asked for them to keep it quiet until she told her daughters			1
but the months passed and the girl returned to college , and @entity0 struggled to find the right moment , she told the @entity39			0
when her father died in january , she realised it was time			0
her daughters , @entity58 , @entity60 , and @entity150 , were stunned to hear of the note			1
' i was bawling , because i recognised his handwriting , ' @entity58 , 29 , recalled			0
' i thought he was killed instantly			0
' @entity60 , 22 , added : ' everyone hoped that it was right on impact			0
that he did n't suffer			0
' impact : @entity3 smashed into the south tower of the @entity4 hitting near to where @entity21 worked at @entity49 he survived to write a note - before the tower collapsed fallen : the note was found among the debris at the bottom of the towers and eventually passed to the @entity116 's office , which carried out dna tests on the blood and matched it to @entity21 's they had hoped the same for his colleagues , too , she said , who also had children and families			1
the @entity179 began reaching out to other relatives of those killed alongside @entity21 , to tell them the truth			1
@entity0 said that although it changed their knowledge of that day for the worse , she is so thankful she found out the truth - while other families have chosen not to be notified when fragments are found			2
@entity189 , chief curator of the museum , told the advocate : ' it 's so amazing to think that @entity21 wrote it and it eventually ended up with his wife and three daughters , which is an amazing arc of a day			1
' we are incredibly proud to be able to show it and i think it will be one of the most powerful artifacts in the museum			0
' after the 2001 attacks on @entity86 , the @entity85 had to contend with thousands of bodies , many completely shattered and unrecognisable , buried among the wreckage of the crumbled buildings			0
a huge 1.8million tons was eventually moved to a landfill for workers to start sifting through , in the hopes of making positive ids on the nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks			2
nearly 11 years on , a small group of scientists are still desperately working to give grieving families the justice they crave			0
more than 9,000 pieces of bone , some the size of just a @entity219 , are kept at @entity222 , a building on 30th street in @entity223 , @entity217 reported last year			0
five dedicated staff inexhaustibly sift through crushed remains of bone taken from the scene day after day , cross-referencing any clues they get with @entity231 samples from the victims ' families			0
last year , just two ids were made , leaving 1,121 victims still unidentified			0
so far , the office has identified less than 60 per cent of the 2,753 people who died on 9/11			2
just 17 of the remains were identified by sight alone , 305 were determined by fingerprints , 25 by photographs , 78 by personal effects , 534 by dental or body x-rays and six by tattoos			0
the work also involves profiling the dna of the victims to match against the bones			0
samples were collected by taking dna from toothbrushes or by swabbing living relatives			0
even though it is painstaking , families have praised the work as vital			0
@entity255 , a former deputy chief of the @entity256 who lost his son on 9/11 , told the magazine : ' we recovered my son march 25 , 2002 but it was n't all of him			2
i would want to bring all his parts back to @entity264 and put them all in one place			0
