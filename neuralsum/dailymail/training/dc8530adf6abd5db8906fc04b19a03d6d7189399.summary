a federal judge on monday appeared deeply skeptical of an @entity3 sheriff 's lawsuit seeking to halt president @entity5 's plan to spare nearly 5 million people from deportation until after the end of his administration			1
@entity11 district judge @entity10 , herself nominated to the federal bench by @entity5 in 2010 , questioned whether @entity14 sheriff @entity13 had legal standing to challenge the immigration program the president announced last month			1
she suggested the topic is better left for @entity19 and the @entity5 administration to sort out			2
but @entity13 's lawyer , @entity21 , told reporters outside the courtroom that ' we have serious issues of constitutionality involved			0
' in the first courtroom battle over @entity5 's plan , @entity21 said the president violated the @entity30 by doing an end - run around @entity19			1
' it 's not policy , he 's creating law and he can not do that under the @entity30 , ' @entity21 said of @entity5			2
@entity13 has often clashed with the federal government over the enforcement of immigration laws and he has filed suit to stop new policies announced by @entity5			1
he claims that more than 35 percent of immigrants living in @entity14 illegally who wound up in his jails this year were repeat offenders , buttressing his view that federal officials have done a poor job of deporting criminals			0
but @entity70 lawyer @entity69 said @entity13 's lawsuit seemed to be raising a ' political dispute ' rather than a legal claim the court could address			2
the @entity5 administration has called the case ' speculative and unsubstantiated ' and has urged the court to dismiss it			0
@entity10 at times seemed exasperated with @entity21 , a longtime conservative activist who has filed hundreds of lawsuits against the federal government , including challenges to @entity5 's @entity11 citizenship			1
when @entity21 said his client has been threatened because of his tough views on @entity5 's immigration policy , @entity10 responded : ' that just does n't cut it for me			1
' @entity10 also said it did not appear that @entity13 could show a ' concrete ' injury he has suffered from the new policy , especially since it will take months before the bulk of it actually goes into effect			0
' if @entity19 does n't like it , does n't @entity19 have the power to step in ? ' she asked			2
@entity10 said she would issue a ruling in the case soon			0
@entity5 's plan , derided by conservatives as an ' amnesty ' for millions of lawbreakers , marks the most sweeping change to the nation 's immigration policies in nearly three decades and set off a fierce fight on @entity108			1
the changes include work permits and three - year deportation stays for more than 4 million immigrants here illegally			0
it mostly applies to those who have been in the country more than five years and have children who are @entity11 citizens or legal permanent residents			0
judge @entity10 , nominated by @entity5 , is hearing a case focused on claims that the president has violated the @entity30 by doing an end run around @entity19 and that drastic changes in immigration programs should be stopped under the program , the @entity124 would prioritize the removal of immigrants who present threats to national security , public safety or border security			1
@entity124 officials could deport someone if an @entity135 field office director determined that removing the person would serve an important federal interest			0
the @entity138 has insisted that @entity5 is acting under proper legal authority to enforce the nation 's immigration laws			1
@entity13 has suffered a series of stinging political defeats in his quest to slow the flow of illegal immigrants into his @entity3 county			1
just last week he agreed to give up a major part of his efforts that won him popularity among voters but gradually were dismantled by the @entity5 administration and the courts			0
@entity13 's office said dec. 17 that it would disband a controversial squad that has raided businesses to arrest more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen ids to get jobs			2
@entity21 of the conservative nonprofit @entity160 is representing the @entity14 , @entity3 sheriff 's office in the lawsuit , and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop @entity5 from granting legal status to approximately 4.7 illegal aliens in the @entity11 after complaints from the @entity168 and other groups that charged he was engaging in racial profiling – most illegal immigrants in @entity3 are @entity173 – his office was found to have done so at least in some traffic stops			1
as a result the federal government had stripped him of special federal immigration powers and investigated him for alleged civil rights violations			0
@entity13 , however , remains popular in @entity3 , where voters have elected him six times			2
he is best known for operating a series of outdoor ' tent city ' jails where male inmates are limited to wearing pink underwear , those over age 18 are required to registered for the @entity190 military draft			0
in 2007 he launched an in - house jail radio station that broadcasts patriotic songs , @entity194 tunes , educational shows and classical music 20 hours each week .			0

@entity11 's ' toughest sheriff ' wants to force @entity199 to stop the flow of illegal - immigrants criminals into his *southern* @entity3 county
sheriff @entity13 aims to stop new @entity5 *executive* actions that will *guarantee* millions of immigration lawbreakers a free pass from deportation
a federal judge is skeptical that the sheriff has ' standing ' to sue since his law enforcement agency has n't yet seen the effects of the new policy
the judge , @entity216 , was appointed by @entity5 in 2010
lawsuit hopes to prove the @entity138 did an end - run around @entity19 and *seized* *lawmaking* power that belongs to federal *legislators*
