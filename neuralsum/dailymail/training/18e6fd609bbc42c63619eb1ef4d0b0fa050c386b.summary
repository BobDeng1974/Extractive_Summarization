as one @entity1 was announcing his arrival in @entity3 on monday , another was reflecting on a spectacular start to his career here just a few hundred yards across the fields of @entity8			2
@entity9 cost @entity10 significantly less than the £ 37million their neighbours have paid for @entity13 , but it is hard to think of anyone who has had a greater impact on the @entity17 this season than the man they call @entity21			1
@entity9 , 28 , has been a vital cog in @entity10 ’s goal machine , contributing 23 goals in 33 games to a team now dreaming of the @entity27			1
it has earned him cult status with his new supporters and spread fear among opponents			2
it soon becomes clear the image of the brooding @entity1 with dark beard and tattoos is misleading			2
‘ i ’m just the opposite of a beast , ’ he says			2
‘ i ’m totally different			2
i ’m very affectionate as a person and i like to spend time chilling out with my family			1
‘ if anything , my daughter has maybe taken this image of the beast to heart because she ’s the wild one ! it came about when i was at @entity68			2
it was more of dressing - room thing really			0
none of the fans knew me as that , but it became more public when i got here			0
‘ at first , i was called @entity74 because i had a bit of a @entity77 haircut and i used to celebrate goals by clasping my hands above my head			0
’ these days , each goal is followed by a kiss of the inside of his right wrist and then the left @entity86 ’s wrist is tattooed with the letters @entity87 , the initials of his elder brothers @entity90 and @entity92 and parents , @entity94 and @entity95			2
those of his wife @entity97 and their daughter appear on his bicep			0
the striker also has @entity41 ’s little footprint tattooed on the left foot that has despatched so many goals this season			1
it ’s clear that family means a great deal to @entity9			1
the sacrifices his father made working long hours as a taxi driver in @entity47 to provide for his three boys have not been forgotten			1
preferring to play football with his older brothers and their friends , @entity9 grew up idolising @entity115 and @entity117 ’s @entity116			1
it was there , on the streets of @entity46 , that he learned to take the hard knocks			0
sealed with a kiss : @entity9 's celebration has become a familiar sight in @entity125 this season fans favourtie : @entity9 was spotted in @entity128 town @entity127 on monday afternoon gentle giant : @entity9 takes time to chat to a supporter while filling up his @entity131 bully boy : @entity9 is famed for his bullish style and lethal finishing in front of goal ‘ my brother @entity90 was a centre back			1
i used to really wind him up because i ’d be trying all kinds of tricks on him , nutmegs and things like that , and he ’d just kick me , ’ says @entity9			1
‘ he ’d knock me to the ground and not even offer a hand to help me up			0
‘ i speak to them every day			0
they are footballers themselves and are still making a living from football ( @entity90 at @entity151 and @entity92 at @entity152 )			0
they ’ve not had the fortune to get as far as i have but they ’re really pleased for me			0
‘ we think that , secretly , the reason our dad worked so much is because it was bedlam at home with me and my brothers arguing so much			0
he ’s still a taxi driver			1
i ’ve tried to tell him to give it up but it ’s impossible to prise him out of his taxi			2
‘ i know that my parents gave up a lot and throughout my life i ’ve been marked by my childhood experiences			0
i ’ve not forgotten where i came from			0
’ it says much about @entity9 ’s talent that on the two occasions @entity47 let him leave , they inserted a buy - back clause into the deal			1
on the second occasion , stuck behind @entity116 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 , coach @entity171 not surprisingly advised him to accept a move to @entity179			1
@entity181 : @entity9 admires current manager @entity171 for advising him to leave for @entity179 summer deals : @entity9 , @entity183 ( centre ) and @entity185 ( right ) joined before the start of the season out in the cold : @entity9 was low in the pecking order during his time at @entity47 idolised : @entity9 , who found goals while at @entity179 ( left ) , admires great strikers like @entity115 ( right ) ' my brother @entity90 was a centre back			1
i used to really wind him up because i ’d be trying all kinds of tricks on him , nutmegs and things like that , and he ’d just kick me ' ‘ he did n’t make me go through the entire pre-season in the hope that i might be featuring , ’ he recalls			0
‘ he does n’t hide from talking to you face to face and that ’s what a dressing room wants from a manager			0
he ’s one of the reasons i ’m here at @entity10			1
it was never tough for me meeting up again			0
’ @entity211 made an unsuccessful £ 9million bid to sign @entity9 for @entity213 last january			1
@entity215 scouts also monitored his progress and there was talk of interest from @entity220			0
but when @entity171 and @entity10 came knocking with the offer of a four - year deal worth £ 75,000 a week last summer , @entity9 knew the time was right to join former @entity179 team - mate @entity185 and the rest of @entity10 ’s @entity226 - speaking contingent			1
a deal worth £ 16.4m plus £ 4.2m in add - ons was agreed , and it quickly became clear from @entity9 ’s debut on the club ’s tour of @entity232 that @entity171 had found a typical @entity125 no 9 in @entity233			1
‘ @entity236 and he will score , ’ has since become a popular twist on an old favourite at @entity10			1
once again , however , the image does him a disservice			0
@entity9 can operate as a traditional target man but he can offer so much more than an aerial threat in terms of his creativity , vision and movement			1
dream : @entity9 is targeting a @entity247 selection with @entity233 next summer invention : @entity9 deftly lifts the ball over the onrushing @entity250 during the @entity252 clash happy man : @entity21 enjoys playing with @entity254 ( centre ) or @entity256 ' i think there is more to come			1
as an individual and a team we ’re not going to settle for what we ’ve achieved so far			0
' it ’s no surprise that he looks equally comfortable playing alongside @entity254 or the bigger @entity256			0
‘ a lot of people maybe make the mistake of thinking i ’m just a big strapping centre forward who is going to be barging into defenders and creating trouble physically , ’ he says			0
‘ yes , there is that side to me , but i think i have an extra plus where i do try to show that little bit of invention			0
i try to surprise people with a touch or something spectacular in a finish			0
’ it has helped @entity171 ’s rampant team rack up an astonishing 107 goals this season as they challenge on four fronts			1
@entity286 and @entity287 might pose substantial obstacles in two of those competitions , but @entity10 are through to the @entity252 final against @entity292 and lie menacingly in second place in the @entity17 table			1
can they win all four ? ‘ it ’s possible simply because we ’re still involved in all four competitions , ’ @entity9 says			1
‘ to be totally honest it would be tough to imagine both myself and the team would be scoring quite as many goals as we have			0
but i think there is more to come			0
as an individual and a team we ’re not going to settle for what we ’ve achieved so far			0
’ goal glut : @entity9 blasts the ball past @entity307 during the @entity309 replay with @entity310 double act : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity256 have proven to be an effective pairing at @entity10 leading the charge : @entity9 was ruthless during the 6 - 0 hammering of @entity315 at the @entity316 watch @entity315 v @entity10 on wednesday exclusively live at 7pm on @entity318 1 ... and do n’t miss all this on @entity318 : @entity215 v @entity320 ( sat 1 feb , 12.45pm ) @entity322 v @entity321 ( sat 8 feb , 12.45pm ) @entity325 v @entity323 ( tues 11 feb , 7.45pm ) @entity321 v @entity326 ( weds 12 feb , 7.45pm ) @entity287 v @entity213 ( sat 22 feb , 12.45pm ) tomorrow night , @entity10 face a difficult trip to @entity328 , where @entity9 is expected to come up against @entity329 , one of his rivals for the no 9 shirt in @entity233 ’s @entity247 squad			1
having missed out in 2010 before picking up a @entity335 winner ’s medal , @entity9 is determined to make it to @entity117			2
he says : ‘ @entity329 and @entity337 come to mind as rivals in this country , as well as @entity340 who has been out injured , but there are lots of players in @entity233 fighting for it as well			2
it ’s going to be a battle			2
’ and as everyone knows by now , @entity21 loves a battle .			2

@entity10 's powerful striker eager to pick up *silverware* in debut season
@entity9 *reveals* he admires @entity171 for telling him to leave for @entity179 during his time at @entity47
@entity233 *hitman* kisses tattoos dedicated to family *members* after each goal
eager to battle for his place in @entity364 's @entity247 squad
family man @entity9 's father still works as a taxi driver
