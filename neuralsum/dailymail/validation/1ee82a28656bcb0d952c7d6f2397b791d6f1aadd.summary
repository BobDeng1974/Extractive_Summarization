@entity0 became the first man to score a double hundred in a @entity4 knockout match and propelled co-hosts @entity5 into the semi-finals as they claimed a 143 - run win against @entity10			1
the 28 - year - old batsman was dropped in the first over before going on to score 237 from 163 balls - including 24 fours and 11 sixes , one of which found the roof of @entity19 's @entity18 in the final over			1
the record - breaking innings , which was the second highest one day international score of all time behind @entity24 @entity23 's 264 , helped @entity5 to 393 for six			2
@entity5 will face @entity49 in the semi-finals while @entity51 play @entity52 in the other match			1
it could have been so different , though , had @entity55 held a the catch just three balls in which would have sent @entity0 back to the pavilion			1
@entity0 also survived two lbw shouts , but @entity5 captain @entity60 had less luck at the other end as he fell for 12 runs			2
@entity64 had put on 33 before falling to @entity65 , whose wide delivery ended up with @entity40 at short cover			0
meanwhile @entity0 was moving towards his half - century and reached it with a single from the last ball of the 20th over to put @entity5 on 105 for two			1
his ton had been put together with a steady succession of fours but his first six arrived in the 36th over as he carted @entity74 to wide long - on			0
@entity0 was perhaps guilty of ball - watching when @entity76 was run out for 42 but , despite the fact the mistake would likely be overlooked due to his heroics , he made sure to atone for it by reaching his second 150 in @entity81 with a single off @entity82			2
@entity83 was then caught by an off - pace delivery from @entity65 , shuffling across to pull the ball across to @entity40 at midwicket for 15			0
@entity0 's double - ton was within reach and he wasted no time gunning for it , achieving his personal best of 192 with a four off @entity65 before partner @entity91 was dismissed on review			0
@entity0 ignored that disappointment to fire a four that brought him to 199 , going on to drill @entity65 's first delivery of the 48th over to long - off for a four that made @entity4 history			2

in reply , the @entity10 stuttered , with @entity124 out for three in the second over before @entity126 departed for 12 as they rocked on 27 for two			0
@entity5 's @entity76 dives to make a single during his innings of 42 @entity10 celebrate after @entity129 ran out @entity36 to temporarily check @entity5 's momentum @entity83 plays a shot - he made 15 runs before being caught by @entity40 off the bowling of @entity65 @entity116 shakes the hand of @entity0 after the opener reached his double century @entity83 plays a shot as @entity5 race towards a massive total of 393 in the quarter - final @entity46 celebrates after bowling @entity10 opener @entity124 for three runs the @entity10 bowler @entity65 steams in during the quarter - final at the @entity18 @entity46 celebrates with clenched fists after removing @entity129 for a duck @entity55 ( 27 ) applied a steadying hand with the free - hitting @entity40 ( 61 ) , but when the former was caught brilliantly by @entity148 with a one - handed catch on the boundary , wickets again started to fall at regular intervals			1
@entity129 was the next man put , lbw by @entity46 for a duck before @entity40 was clean bowled by @entity153			0
@entity74 hung around for 16 balls for his 27 but after he and @entity155 ( 32 ) were dismissed , @entity10 were left hanging in on 173 for seven			0
