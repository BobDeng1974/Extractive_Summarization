a @entity1 state lawmaker has called a @entity3 congresswoman ' ugly as sin ' and said that her opponent is one of the most attractive women in politics			2
representative @entity8 , a @entity9 from @entity10 , compared @entity12 representative @entity11 to a drag queen in a clueless blog post on @entity15 last week			1
he explained that he was inspired to write the post after hearing ' some polling data which went by too fast for me to write down ' and which he later could not track down on @entity21			2
the poll revealed that ' an attractive candidate can have as much as a seven to ten point advantage over a less attractive ( or even an unattractive ) candidate , ' he wrote			2
he then asked what this might mean for @entity11 's re-election race against her opponent , @entity9 @entity35 , in @entity1 's 2nd congressional district in november			1
' let 's be honest			0
does anyone not believe that congressman @entity11 is as ugly as sin ? and i hope i have n't offended sin , ' @entity8 wrote			1
but by contrast , 32 - year - old @entity35 , is ' one of the most attractive women on the political scene anywhere , not so attractive as to be intimindating [ sic ] , but truly attractive ' , he wrote			1
he said that @entity35 is so attractive that @entity3 have struggled to find a bad picture of her			2
' if looks really matter and if this race is at all close , give a decided edge to @entity35 , ' he wrote			2
cruel : he said rep. @entity11 , pictured left , looked more like a drag queen than most men in drag			1
by comparison , he said that her @entity9 opponent @entity35 , right , was ' truly attractive ' but he does n't stop there			1
he then tells a bizarre story of a ' rather attractive drag queen ' whom he saw outside a bar named @entity60 during a recent trip to @entity62 and said he thought of @entity11 , 58			1
' by now you probably know why i think of @entity11 whenever i walk by @entity60 , ' he said			0
' sad to say , but the drag queens are more atrractive [ sic ] than @entity11			0
' he concluded : ' @entity11 looks more like a drag queen than most men in drag			1
' he seemed to be aware that his disgusting comments might upset a few readers as he had prefaced the comments with a warning , saying : ' the subject matter , although very real , may prove uncomfortable for some of my more sensitive readers			0
' @entity11 's campaign has declined to comment on the blog post			1
but @entity35 said the ' sexist ' comments ' have absolutely no place in political discourse '			1
' both rep. @entity11 and i have experienced this unfortunate reality of being a woman in politics , ' she said in a statement , @entity83 said			0
' i hope that as time moves forward and more female candidates run for political office around the country , people will focus on the content of our ideas rather than what we wear and how we look			0
' leader : @entity11 , right with a supporter , was elected to @entity1 's 2nd congressional district in 2013 fan : @entity35 ( pictured ) should win november 's race if looks have a part to play , @entity8 said readers of the blog apparently had the same stunned reaction			1
beneath the post , they lambasted his rant , branding him a ' bully ' and calling for his resignation			0
' you never mentioned qualifications for either women , ' one said			0
@entity8 has refused to say if he stands behind his comments			0
the lawmaker is no stranger to controversy			0
in 2012 , he was forced to publicly apologize for saying ' @entity119 ' and giving a @entity121 salute during a heated floor exchange			0
although one recent independent poll by @entity125 puts @entity35 ahead , @entity11 has long been leading the polls , results show			2
@entity11 , a mother - of - two , was elected to office in 2013 .			0
