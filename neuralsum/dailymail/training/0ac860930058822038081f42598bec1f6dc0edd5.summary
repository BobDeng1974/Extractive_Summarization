by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 18:21 est , 11 october 2013 labour former home and foreign secretary @entity1 has accused the @entity3 of ' indulgent irresponsibility ' condemnation of the @entity3 for publishing top - secret files intensified yesterday as @entity1 accused the paper of ‘ indulgent irresponsibility ’			1
in a devastating indictment , the @entity9 former home and foreign secretary said it had developed a ‘ sense of power and almost adolescent excitement ’ from holding thousands of classified intelligence documents			1
as a result , its journalists - whom he accused of ‘ extraordinary naivety and arrogance ’ - were ‘ blinding themselves about the consequence ’ of putting the material in the public domain			1
mr @entity1 ’s criticisms are among the most damning yet about the @entity3 ’s printing of @entity29 and @entity30 government secrets stolen by fugitive @entity32 worker @entity31			1
they are especially potent coming from a former @entity9 cabinet minister whose tenure in government included lengthy periods overseeing the work of @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
the newspaper continues to insist it will carry on publishing the secrets and yesterday its front page claimed there would be a ‘ review ’ of surveillance powers initiated by deputy prime minister @entity50			0
but yesterday morning @entity51 dismissed the suggestion outright , with a spokesman for the prime minister endorsing the current system of oversight and saying : ‘ there is not a @entity59 review			0
’ mr @entity50 ’s aides quickly distanced themselves from the @entity3 ’s story , saying he was simply ‘ posing the question ’ about oversight of the security and intelligence agencies			1
meanwhile , other former senior intelligence and security officials lined up to condemn the newspaper and issue further warnings about the damage done by mr @entity31 ’s theft of the documents , which are thought to be in the hands of the @entity75 government			2
sir @entity76 , the former head of @entity42 , the government ’s listening station , said the @entity3 , and others in possession of the leaked files , had published information that was invaluable to foreign spies , terrorists and criminal networks			1
he said it was the ‘ most catastrophic loss to @entity30 intelligence ever ’ , eclipsing even the leaks by the @entity88 , the ring of spies including @entity91 and @entity92 , who were turned by the @entity93			0
last week , before the row exploded , sir @entity76 told @entity98 ’s @entity97 : ‘ not even the @entity99 in its heyday of @entity91 , @entity92 and [ @entity101 ] @entity102 could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents			2
mr @entity1 's criticisms are among the most damning yet about the @entity3 's printing of @entity29 and @entity30 government secrets stolen by fugitive @entity32 worker @entity31 ( pictured ) ‘ my fear is that we are now going to witness a slow motion car crash in which gradually sources dry up , targets such as terrorist and cyber criminals will work out what are the kind of capabilities that we have and they will adapt their methods			1
it will be harder to track them down			0
’ but it is mr @entity1 ’s comments – the first criticism from a senior @entity9 figure – that are the most incendiary			1
in an interview with @entity98 @entity127 , to be broadcast tomorrow , mr @entity1 said : ‘ the head of the security service , @entity40 , has been absolutely right to say what he has said , and i regret what i can only describe as indulgent , irresponsibility by the @entity3 newspaper			1
‘ you can always justify everything , if you ’re a newspaper , on the grounds that this is open journalism , but this is about much more than journalism , it ’s genuinely about how we protect the national interest			0
‘ and that ’s not just about protecting the establishment , it ’s about keeping people safe , it ’s about avoiding another 7th of july 2005			0
’ mr @entity1 said the publication had ‘ potentially ’ risked lives			2
he added : ‘ i ’m not suggesting for a moment that anybody at the @entity3 gratuitously wants to risk anybody ’s life			2
sir @entity76 said the @entity3 had published information that was invaluable to foreign spies , terrorists and criminal networks ‘ but what i do think is their sense of power of having these secrets and excitement , almost adolescent excitement , about these secrets , has gone to their head and they ’re blinding themselves about the consequence , and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets which they publish are or are not likely to damage the national interest			1
‘ and they ’re not in any position at all to do that			0
’ condemnation of the @entity3 began on tuesday when , in a major speech , the new @entity40 director general @entity182 said revelations about @entity42 ’s techniques were a ‘ gift to terrorists ’ , and had given them the advantage they needed to ‘ strike at will ’			2
his comments were immediately backed by prime minister @entity192 and home secretary @entity193 and sparked calls for an inquiry into whether the @entity3 should be prosecuted			1
mr @entity50 has lined up alongside the pm by saying the leaks ‘ helped terrorists ’			0
@entity198 , the former director of operations and intelligence at @entity41 , said the leaked documents contained ‘ an awful lot of operational detail ... about ongoing activities which risk being compromised ’			0
he told @entity204 ’s @entity205 he understood there was a ‘ real possibility ’ that people could have been put at risk as a result of the leaks			0
mr @entity198 warned that terror groups would now be much more aware of @entity42 ’s ‘ vulnerabilities ’ and assessing the damage would be difficult .			0
