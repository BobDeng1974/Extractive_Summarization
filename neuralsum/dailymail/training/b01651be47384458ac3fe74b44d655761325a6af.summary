he did n't mention the movie by name but was clearly referring to ' @entity19 ' , which stars @entity20 and @entity21 and will open in @entity12 cinemas in october			2
stepping into role : in the film @entity12 born @entity8 actor @entity24 plays @entity7 the film tells the farcical story of a talk - show host and his producer who land an exclusive interview with @entity7 , and are then asked by the @entity31 to assassinate him			1
the ' reckless @entity12 provocative insanity ' of mobilising a ' gangster filmmaker ' to challenge the @entity8 's leadership is triggering ' a gust of hatred and rage ' among @entity8 people and soldiers , the spokesman said			1
the film 's release would be considered an ' act of war that we will never tolerate , ' he said in remarks cited by @entity8 state media			1
the threat came after @entity8 agricultural workers held a rally in @entity50 , south of @entity51 , yesterday to vow to take revenge on the @entity12			1
the rally was held one day before the anniversary of the outbreak of the @entity55			1

' @entity109 , executive director of @entity110 for @entity8 - @entity111 and an unofficial spokesman for @entity51 , dismissed the movie			2
he told the @entity114 its assassination plot represents @entity12 's desperate foreign policy as a whole			2
@entity109 told the paper : ' there is a special irony in this storyline as it shows the desperation of the @entity12 government and @entity12 society			0
' a film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the @entity12 has done in @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			0
and let us not forget who killed [ president @entity135 â€“ @entity12			2
' international incident : @entity21 and @entity20 's latest feature , @entity19 , depicts the pair trying to kill the country 's supreme leader @entity7 - and @entity8 is not amused special access : @entity21 and @entity20 play talk show host and producer that have been chosen to interview the leader the spokesman said @entity12 's history of backing political assassinations should be a concern to @entity148			1
' in fact , president @entity148 should be careful in case the @entity12 military wants to kill him as well			0
' as for @entity20 and @entity21 , while the supreme leader may check out their film , it will never hold up compared to @entity157 films which the spokesman said were far better and realistic			0
@entity109 said : ' @entity159 is a good character and those films are much more enjoyable			0
' his love for @entity159 films is a little ironic considering in @entity164 the spy is imprisoned and tortured in @entity8			0
@entity8 , which has no independent press , often holds foreign governments responsible for the content of their media			0
@entity51 regularly warns @entity76 to prevent conservative papers from mocking or criticising its leadership , something banned within authoritarian @entity8 , where the @entity7 family is revered			0
it is not the first time a @entity5 comedy lampooned a @entity8 leader			0
@entity7 's late father @entity100 was also targeted for assassination by the puppets of @entity181			0
