@entity0 says public criticism of @entity2 has fuelled the team 's recent revival			1
@entity2 are now odds - on to qualify for the @entity6 after they recorded back - to - back wins over @entity8 and @entity9			1
such a double would have seemed impossible just a few months ago			2
manager @entity10 came under fire after his team put in a number of underwhelming displays			1
@entity0 ( left ) celebrates after @entity2 's 2 - 1 victory over top four rivals @entity9 on sunday @entity17 ( left ) scored twice to put @entity2 in the driving seat for @entity6 qualification some of the strongest criticism came from @entity22 players like @entity23 , who compared @entity25 's side to a pub team and @entity27 , who labelled some of @entity2 's play ' prehistoric '			1
but with @entity2 now five points clear of fifth - placed @entity9 , their critics have fallen silent			1
' people criticising does spur you on , ' @entity0 said			2
' you are always going to get critics			0
we are at a massive club here at @entity2 and if things are n't going as well as they should be then there is always going to be people wanting to have a dig and a pop at you			2
@entity0 admits that public criticism sparked @entity2 's impressive performances in recent weeks @entity2 also defeated @entity8 in their previous @entity48 game at @entity49 ' we have been well aware of the criticism we have had			1
we are professionals and we are in a job where people have an opinion about you and they are entitled to it and we just have to get on with it			0
' people can assume and predict and it is up to us to prove them all wrong			0
that is what the lads enjoy doing			0
we enjoy proving them wrong			0
so far we have done that			0
' @entity0 has come in for criticism himself this season , but he and @entity65 performed well against a fierce @entity9 attack at @entity67 and the two kept 29 - goal striker @entity69 quiet in the 3 - 0 win over @entity8			1
@entity0 and @entity65 were identified as long - term replacements for @entity72 and @entity73 at @entity2			1
@entity0 and his @entity2 team - mates applaud supporters after their away win at @entity67 @entity0 and fellow defender @entity65 ( centre ) were once doubted as the future of @entity79 's defence the pair were also touted as alternatives to the @entity72 - @entity83 partnership with @entity79 , but as @entity0 points out , they have not played together often as a centre - half pairing			1
' it has been difficult for us , ' said @entity0 , who has played alongside @entity65 at centre - back for @entity79 just once			2
' it had been documented that me and @entity65 were going to be the next centre - backs at @entity2 but it has not gone how we would have liked it			2
' somebody told me the other day that we have actually only played alongside each other about four times in four seasons			0
' you can not build a partnership on four games			0
' hopefully now we have had back - to - back games together we can keep it going and keep playing well together			0
we complement each other well			0
