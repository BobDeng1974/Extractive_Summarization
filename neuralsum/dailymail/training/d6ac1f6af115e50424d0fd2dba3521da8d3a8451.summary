by @entity0 published : 03:15 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 30 april 2013 @entity1 has launched the @entity3 campaign to ensure that women are informed , empowered and protected when it comes to cosmetic surgery as the editor of one of the @entity11 ’s leading glossy magazines , and a forty - something woman who wants to look good , i consider myself to be well informed about the beauty industry and the world of cosmetic surgery			1
@entity1 has always prided itself on investigative journalism , in the past we ’ve dug into the murky world of cosmetic surgery tourism , and we ’ve also reported on the shocking @entity22 scandal , when it came to light that 45,000 women had given faulty breast implants containing industrial fluid			1
but @entity22 aside , like most people i had assumed that any surgical procedure that takes place in this country would surely have to be safe , and that if you can walk down your high street and get a shot of botox or some crows feet filled while on the way to do the weekly shop , then surely those products must be licensed or have undergone rigorous testing too ? yet when i was invited onto sir @entity42 ’s committee to review the regulation of cosmetic interventions , i was truly shocked at how little protection @entity11 consumers have in an industry that ’s now worth nearly £ 3bn a year to our economy			1
this is why @entity1 has launched the ‘ @entity56 ’ campaign to urge the government to implement the recommendations of the committee as soon as possible to ensure that women are informed , empowered and protected			1
and we also want to encourage our readers to take responsibility too : to ask the right questions , do the research and be realistic about the outcomes of any of these procedures , because the truth is , very often they do n’t live up to the expectation			0
thanks in part to the glut of real - life makeover shows extolling the virtues of liposuction , fillers and teeth whitening , as well as our bizarre national obsession with programmes like @entity77 , there has been an explosion in the number of cosmetic procedures taking place in the @entity11 over the last five years			1
with nine out of ten of those being @entity85 and dermal fillers , it seems that women as young as 20 are happily incorporating them into their beauty regimes alongside regular manicures and blowdrys			2
this huge increase in demand , coupled with a lack of regulation , has encouraged far too many unqualified , dubious characters , looking to make a fast buck to set up in business			0
it seems that women as young as 20 are happily incorporating @entity85 and fillers into their beauty regimes alongside regular manicures and blowdrys i ’ve heard shocking stories about pop - up @entity85 clinics in places like hairdressers and nightclubs , where young women queue up to sign a consent form , pen in one hand , drink in the other , and then have fillers injected into their lips			1
when it goes wrong , as it very easily can do , there is nowhere to turn to for help , and often these women feel too ashamed or embarrassed to take any action			0
frequently , it is the good old @entity122 that has to pick up the tab for putting it right			0
and this is just the tip of the iceberg			0
when editor @entity0 invited onto sir @entity42 's committee to review the regulation of cosmetic interventions , she was shocked at how little protection @entity11 consumers have during my time on the review committee , we delved much further , looking in detail at products used for surgical and non-surgical procedures , the people who administer them , the way they are advertised and the advice and support patients and consumers are given before , during and after their treatments			1
our final recommendations , published this week , include establishing an implant register with fillers falling under the same controls as other implants ( it was extremely difficult to trace the 45,000 women given @entity22 implants as there was no register , many of the companies who used them had gone out of business and a lot of the women did n’t even know which implants they ’d been given )			2
there are currently nearly 200 fillers available in the @entity11 , yet only 14 are licensed for use in the @entity161 , so from now on , fillers will also have to pass vigorous safety appraisals , be prescription only and only those with appropriate skills can administer them			1
other recommendations include a register of qualified and assessed surgeons who practice in the @entity11 to prevent fly in fly out doctors and , very importantly an independent ombudsman for women to go to when something does go wrong			2
so after everything i ’ve learned during my eight months on the review committee , would i have cosmetic surgery ? having been under the knife for two back operations , i would never want to subject my body to a surgical procedure if it was n’t absolutely necessary			0
but @entity85 ? i would n’t be averse to a shot or two of that			0
i ’ll definitely be doing my research beforehand though			0
