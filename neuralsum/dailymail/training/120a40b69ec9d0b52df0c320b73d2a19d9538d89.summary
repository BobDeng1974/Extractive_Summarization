by @entity1 medical correspondent life - saving : diagnosis has improved vastly since 1994 , according to the study tens of thousands of lives have been saved since the 1990s because patients with high blood pressure have been diagnosed and treated more effectively , researchers claim			1
a study found around 70,000 heart attacks and strokes were avoided in 2011 , some of which would have been fatal			1
if the current rate of improvement continues , the annual number of cardiovascular events avoided will be 120,000 by 2022			2
around 30 per cent of people in @entity20 have high blood pressure , the biggest risk factor for early death			0
but experts say increasing use of a wide range of effective drugs is paying off			0
using data from five @entity20 polls from 1994 to 2011 , experts analysed trends in blood pressure treatment			1
professor @entity33 , one of the researchers from @entity35 , said steady progress had resulted in around 70,000 cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes being prevented in 2011			1
he added : ‘ the 70,000 is an estimated one - year effect , whereby if 2011 practice had been applied in 1994 we estimate there would have been about 70,000 fewer major cardiovascular events in 1994			1
‘ if we continue at the current linear rate of improvement , then by the year 2022 there ’ll be about 50,000 fewer major events compared with 2011 as a result			1
‘ these estimates are the result of treating more people who need it , more effectively			0
’ high blood pressure , known as hypertension , is classified as more than 140/90 millimetres of mercury ( @entity57 )			2
the first figure , systolic pressure , corresponds to the ‘ surge ’ of each heartbeat			0
the second , or diastolic , reading is the pressure during the rest between beats			0
condition : high blood pressure , or hypertension , is classified as more than 140/90 millimetres of mercury hypertension patients are advised to eat less salt , lose weight , drink less alcohol , eat more fruit and vegetables and exercise more			2
six million @entity76 take blood pressure drugs			0
the study found blood pressure steadily improved between 1994 and 2011 , with the average systolic reading falling by @entity81 in men and @entity83 in women			1
treatment rates doubled between 1994 and 2011 , with 58 per cent of hypertensive adults receiving medication in 2011			1
among those treated , the proportion of patients keeping blood pressure below @entity91 almost doubled from 33 per cent in 1994 to 63 per cent in 2011			1
‘ whereas once half the general population with high blood pressure were diagnosed , half of those detected treated , and half of those treated controlled , now management in @entity20 is better than the rule of two - thirds ' study leader @entity102 as a result , blood pressure levels have fallen @entity105 since 1994 in adults receiving treatment , according to the study			1
the data , published in journal @entity111 , suggests many patients benefit from high doses of one drug , or two or three combined , and that some classes of drugs work better for certain age groups			0
study leader @entity102 said there was ‘ cause for optimism ’			0
‘ whereas once ... half the general population with high blood pressure were diagnosed , half of those detected treated , and half of those treated controlled , now management in @entity20 is better than the rule of two - thirds , ’ she added			0
@entity125 of @entity126 and @entity127 of @entity128 wrote in @entity111 : ‘ after 50 years of treatment , it seems that the drugs are working			2
’ like all drugs , the medication has side effects , including drowsiness , pain in the kidney area , a dry cough , light - headedness and a skin rash			0
but patients can be given an alternative if they have an adverse reaction			0
the @entity145 ’s dr @entity144 said the study showed ‘ great progress ’ , but added : ‘ the rates of diagnosis , treatment , and control of raised blood pressure in @entity20 are still too low compared with other countries , such as @entity154			2

treatment rates for hypertension have doubled between 1994 and 2011
researchers from @entity35 analysed changes in care
many of the 70,000 cardiac events in 2011 would have been fatal , they said
