a propaganda film commissioned by @entity2 's military regime was supposed to promote the ' 12 core values ' all @entity2 youths must learn			1
but there was one scene the junta has had trouble explaining : a grinning schoolboy painting an image of @entity11 while his smiling classmate applauds			1
the video , screened before films in major cinemas since saturday , has been met with ridicule on social media and condemned by the @entity19 embassy in @entity20			1
the 11 - minute film tells the story of two schoolboys who learn to accept winning and losing is part of life			2
mr @entity46 claimed the boy shown merrily painting an image of @entity11 saluting beside a swastika was trying to compare his mother to a dictator , in essence a rebellious jest			2
in the video , however , there is no such explanation			0
the scene is part of a sequence without dialogue that depicts an otherwise normal day at school - the boys catching butterflies at a playground , doing experiments in a chemistry class and exercising on a karate mat. it lasts just a few seconds and runs with a cheery tune playing in the background			0
' the film is good , but it has caused a slight misunderstanding in our society , ' mr @entity46 said			2
' we wo n't stop the project , but we will replace that problematic picture with another , more proper one			0
' the director of the film , @entity82 , told @entity83 he did not mean to cause offence but instead was trying to illustrate the child 's moral progress			2
the child is going in the wrong direction			0
but i did n't mean it ( to show @entity11 ) in a bad way , ' said mr @entity82 , whose father is head of @entity94 , one of @entity2 's largest film studios			1
' you know @entity11 had quite strong power in the past			2
but not in a good way			0
so it 's like he ( the boy ) is learning from that until he becomes a good person at the end , ' he said			0
mr @entity82 confirmed the junta had approved the film but said ' nobody asked ' about the contentious scene featuring the painting			0
coup leader - cum - prime minister @entity110 , left , introduced the 12 values as part of a campaign to return ' happiness ' to the people			1
right , a coloured - up photo of @entity11 , whose image is popular in @entity2 @entity19 's ambassador to @entity2 , @entity118 , said he was ' deeply saddened to see this trivialisation and misuse of @entity26 symbols in an official @entity2 movie '			1
' i was surprised that throughout the screening process this movie must have gone through to be approved for public broadcast , none of the smart , well educated people checking it had identified it as being problematic and offensive , ' he said			0
' if we learn anything from this incident it is that @entity137 education , especially its global messages of tolerance , should be introduced into the @entity2 curriculum			2
' images of @entity11 , swastikas and other @entity26 regalia are fairly commonplace in @entity2 - adorning t - shirts and memorabilia - a phenomenon blamed on a lack of historical understanding rather than political leanings			1
the study of history in the @entity2 school system revolves primarily around the history of @entity2 and its long line of kings			0
world history is glossed over , with little or no mention of the @entity137			0
last year , @entity2 's @entity158 apologised for displaying a billboard showing @entity11 with @entity160 and other superheroes			1
officials said it was painted by students who did not realise @entity11 's image would offend anyone			1
a @entity2 catholic school was also left red - faced in 2011 after students dressed up in @entity26 uniform for a sports day parade			1
bizarre : a student poses in front of a congratulatory superhero - themed banner that included @entity11 at the @entity158 in @entity2 after overthrowing the nation 's democratically elected government on may 22 , coup leader - cum - prime minister @entity110 introduced the 12 values as part of a junta campaign to return ' happiness ' to the people			1
the values reflect traditional concepts in @entity2 culture the military felt needed reinforcing , ranging from upholding the monarchy to respecting parents and understanding ' true democratic ideals '			0
some student groups have hit back , calling the values , which highlight obedience towards the royalist establishment , a form of brainwashing			0

the film has been screened in cinemas across @entity2 since saturday
@entity19 's @entity20 embassy condemns it amid social media ridicule
prime minister 's *spokesman* claims the gaffe is just a ' misunderstanding '
@entity11 is popular in @entity2 and is often on t - shirts and memorabilia
