by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 08:41 est , 19 september 2012 a @entity3 town home to around 13,000 people has absolutely no police officers protecting it at times during the week , a whistleblower has said			1
budget cutbacks mean @entity9 in @entity10 sometimes has no - one to uphold the law and incredibly the force in charge says its strategy ' makes sense '			1
a whistle - blower has revealed two officers from the town are diverted to @entity20 on monday nights to help police their student night			1
complaint : the whistleblower says @entity9 is being left un-policed at times because officers are sent to @entity20 ( pictured ) this leaves either one or none at all left in @entity9 and the anonymous serving policeman claims it is ‘ highly unlikely ’ the town would be policed after midnight			1
in a devastating critique of a system he has served for more than 25 years , the whistleblower said the ‘ thin blue line ’ is now so stretched that officers from @entity37 - some 13 miles away - are being forced to cover			2
between zero and three officers hold the fort in @entity9 , where the station ’s strength was previously as high as four or five constables and a sergeant , he said			2
' we think we are just being run ragged , ' he said			0
' we are sticking plasters over a system that ’s crumbling			0
' i ’m concerned , and i know officers i work with are also concerned , about the service we are giving members of the public			0
' we joined to put something back into society and i know we are all disappointed we are not able to do the job we joined to do - that ’s prevent crime and police the streets and make them safer			2
' we understand cuts have to be made but we ’re finding services are suffering because of cuts to staff and the way we are being managed			0
' @entity65 , joint branch chairman of @entity66 , said the whistleblower had highlighted a force - wide problem in which certain areas were ‘ not being staffed to the same degree ’			1
' we anticipated this 18 months ago and it appears it ’s now beginning to happen , ' he said			0
the claims emerged five years after former @entity74 constable @entity73 revealed he was the author of best - selling ‘ whistleblower ’ book @entity76 and popular internet diary @entity78 - both withering exposes of the political correctness , target culture and red tape blighting policing			2
but @entity66 has hit back , pointing out that despite ‘ challenging times ’ borne of a need to save £ 34 million by march 2015 , crime levels were the lowest in more than 10 years and victim satisfaction rates high			1
they also say leaving @entity9 as an almost police - free zone on monday ‘ makes sense ’ as it uses resources better			1
but the force admits that while it has to make savings of £ 34 million by march 2015 with 86 per cent of our budget spent on staff costs , it is unavoidable that the organisation has to operate with fewer people			0
chief inspector @entity99 , @entity100 commander , said : ' these are challenging times and we have been working very hard over the last two years to restructure the force and transform services while protecting service delivery to our communities			0
' dealing with what matters to our communities and having the right staff in the right place at the right time is key			0
' the public expect us to deliver value for money services and this means adopting a common sense approach			0
' if we have demand on a particular night in one town and not another , for example student night in @entity74 is thursday , whereas student night in @entity20 is monday , it makes sense to move some of our resources to cover this demand while ensuring sufficient resources are in place in the remaining areas			1
' many of our staff have experienced big change but have reacted brilliantly and crime levels are the lowest in more than 10 years			2
' crime levels for the first five months of this financial year are down in @entity9 town by seven per cent , a total of 203 reported crimes compared to 219 last year			1
' it is a tribute to all staff that at a time when budgets are reducing significantly and the organisation is shrinking , crime continues to fall and victims ’ satisfaction rates remain very high			0
