by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 20:30 est , 7 february 2013 guests at @entity3 functions enjoyed £ 1,000 bottles of @entity5 1982 , an older vintage than the bottle pictured mps and peers have been drinking bottles of fine wine costing more than £ 1,000 each at the taxpayer ’s expense			1
ministers , officials and their guests got through nearly 5,000 bottles of alcohol worth more than £ 55,000 in the last year , the annual report into the government ’s wine cellar revealed yesterday			1
the official figures show that guests at @entity3 events were treated to 23 bottles of a 1982 vintage @entity26 , which sells for up to £ 1,100 a bottle			1
@entity28 , the foreign office minister , said most of the costs of the government wine cellar had been offset by selling 180 bottles worth £ 44,000 , in a new ‘ self - funding ’ policy			1
but spending watchdogs warned that consumption of expensive wine and spirits will anger hard - pressed taxpayers during a recession			1
in total , 4,651 bottles were taken and £ 48,955 was spent replenishing supplies			1
the government continued its splurge on hospitality in the face of austerity cutbacks , popping the corks of 138 bottles of champagne at up to 230 parties			2
a 1906 bottle of @entity53 brandy worth on average £ 1,472 was also consumed			1
the alcohol would have been bought at much lower prices and cellared for decades			0
guests also opened three bottles of @entity59 port 1931 which is such a rare vintage that no estimates for its worth is readily available			1
the nearest available vintage , 1934 , sells for just over £ 1,900 a bottle			1
@entity66 wines were the most popular although in a nod to patriotism , 36 per cent of the wines were from @entity71 vineyards			0
officials were quick to replenish the stocks , spending £ 48,955 on topping up supplies			1
the popped the corks of 138 bottles of champagne at up to 230 parties taxpayers paid for 2,400 bottles of the @entity71 wine , @entity81 2010 as well as 575 bottles of @entity83 and 600 bottles of the @entity86 red , @entity87			2
civil servants in charge of the shopping list also splurged on 53 bottles of champagne and 360 bottles of @entity71 sparkling wine			2
in the year 2011 - 12 , some 78 bottles of gin were consumed compared to just eight bottles of vodka			2
while it has never gone out of fashion in @entity71 tennis clubs , gin has recently made a comeback as a ' retro ' drink across @entity104			0
an additional 82 bottles of gin and 11 of vodka were bought to ensure that no government function would run dry of white spirits			2
@entity66 wine was the most heavily used , followed by @entity71			0
party - goers at official functions also drank four times the amount of @entity115 wine to @entity116			2
the government wine cellar is controlled by the @entity118 , which defended the serving of expensive drinks at official receptions but the @entity122 ( @entity123 ) said the government should consider selling more of the valuable bottles during a time of austerity			1
@entity128 , the campaigns manager for the @entity123 said : ' it smacks of hypocrisy for the political elite to be quaffing fine wines at a time when ordinary families struggle to make ends meet			0
he added : ' of course there will be a cost associated with hospitality but a time when savings have to be made , it would not be out of place to open more modestly priced bottles of wine			1
government departments sitting on such valuable assets should look at selling them rather than drinking the potential profits			0
' a @entity118 spokesman said : ' whether it is national celebrations , state visits , or receiving guests of government , the @entity155 prides itself on giving a warm welcome through its business hospitality			0
the @entity158 supports this work in a cost effective way			0
' @entity162 has been in operation for over 90 years enabling the government to buy in bulk and also purchase and store young wines for use when are fully mature			0
these help fund the cellar through sales of wine which has matured over time to a greater value			0
' a review ordered by the foreign secretary in 2010 found that the @entity158 was the most cost effective way of catering for @entity154 events , and the cellar is used exclusively for that purpose			0
' the costs of the @entity158 have been a closely guarded secret in previous years			0
the last @entity182 government spent £ 80,662 topping up stocks in its final year of office , 2009 - 2010			2
@entity185 , the foreign secretary , considered abolishing the cellar but decided to keep it because it was cheaper to buy wine in bulk for the future rather than acquiring it at short notice .			0
