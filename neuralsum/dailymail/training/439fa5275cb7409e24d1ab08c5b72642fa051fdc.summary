by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 08:18 est , 12 march 2014 letters : correspondence between prince @entity5 and @entity6 ministers is set to be released prince @entity5 's letters to ministers are set to be made public after a court ruled that the government could not block their publication			1
the attorney general used a ministerial veto to prevent the correspondence being released to a newspaper under freedom of information laws			1
but today one of the country 's most senior judges ruled that he had ' no good reason ' to do so , in a landmark decision which could open the floodgates for the release of sensitive information			1
attorney general @entity24 has vowed to appeal against the decision at the @entity26			1
the letters are said to reveal how the @entity5 lobbies members of the government on issues such as climate change			2
the notes concern @entity5 's ' most deeply held personal views and beliefs ' , according to mr @entity24			2
the @entity35 requested the publication of the letters under the @entity38 and the @entity39			0
in september 2012 , a tribunal headed by a high court judge declared that the letters were subject to the legislation and should be released to the newspaper			0
but mr @entity24 exercised his right to a veto , arguing that the letter would damage @entity5 's ' role as future monarch ' because they show him ' disagreeing with government policy '			1
today the @entity52 , @entity53 , and two other judges overturned the veto because mr @entity24 had no reason to defy the tribunal and was acting illegally under @entity58 law			0
the case is believed to mark the first time that anyone has challenged the attorney general 's powers to block access to information , which could restrict the government 's ability to keep documents secret			1
however , the letters still can not be published pending the outcome of the @entity26 appeal			2
appeal : attorney general @entity24 has vowed to fight against the decision to overturn his veto a spokesman for the attorney general said : ' we are very disappointed by the decision of the court			1
' we will be pursuing an appeal to the @entity26 in order to protect the important principles which are at stake in this case			0
' the order relates to 27 letters from @entity5 to seven different government departments sent between september 2004 and april 2005			1
@entity87 , for the @entity35 , argued that mr @entity24 wanted to block their publication simply because he disagreed with the tribunal judges , adding : ' the implications for the rule of law are grave			2
' lawyers for the attorney general told the court that he was entitled ' to take his own view of what was in the public interest '			0
ruling : a panel of three judges decided that the letters are subject to freedom of information legislation but today @entity53 ruled : ' the attorney general did not have reasonable grounds for forming the opinion on which the certificate was based			1
' the mere fact that he reached a different conclusion from the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) in weighing the competing public interests involved was not good enough			0
' he had no good reason for overriding the meticulous decision the @entity109 reached after six days of hearing and argument			0
' he could point to no error or fact in the @entity109 's decision and the @entity119 departments concerned did not even seek permission to appeal it			2
' the certificate is also unlawful because it is incompatible with @entity124 law			0
' the decision overturns a ruling by three @entity127 last year who supported mr @entity24 's right to apply his veto			0
prince @entity5 's office declined to comment on today 's ruling .			0

@entity5 sent 27 letters *advising* ministers on government policies
@entity109 ruled that they are subject to freedom of information laws , but attorney general @entity24 vetoed their publication in 2012
judges have now decided that he had no right to block the letters ' release
@entity24 has vowed to appeal against the decision at the @entity26
landmark case could curb @entity6 's powers to keep documents secret
