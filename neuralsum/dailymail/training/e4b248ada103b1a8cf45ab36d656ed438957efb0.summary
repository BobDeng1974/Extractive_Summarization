@entity9 's decision to create a similar post for a candidate aged between 18 and 21 has raised questions about their use of public money			1
but @entity26 , @entity9 's police and crime commissioner , still wants to hire a young person to ' act as a conduit between young people and the police '			1

in tweets posted on her personal account before she was appointed youth crime commissioner , miss @entity2 called homosexuals ' fags ' , immigrants ' illegals ' and travellers ' pikeys ' , and said she had ' a thing for older men '			1

' miss @entity2 also posted : ' everyone on made in @entity71 looks like a f * * * * * * fag ' , in reference to the @entity76 reality show			2
post : @entity2 's job was seen as a way of connecting @entity41 with young people but her @entity18 account was not looked at before her appointment remorse : the 17 - year - old , who denies being racist or homophobic , has apologised for any offence caused by the messages posted online the @entity18 account , which has since been deleted , was not checked as part of the recruitment process			1

the teenager 's @entity18 account was not checked as part of the recruitment process			1
announcing plans to create a similar role in @entity9 , @entity26 insisted that it was an important post			2

' i want to appoint a youth ambassador , someone who has experience of working with young people to ensure they have a voice			1

potential applicants have until may 3 to submit their details			0
but critics say the decision ' does not bode well '			0
@entity138 , a member of the county 's @entity139 told the @entity141 : ' it ’s a strange thing that you can pay up to £ 25,000 for a very young person and yet they expect members of the crime panel to scrutinise [ the @entity148 ] without any allowance , the jury ’s out at the moment			2
' police in @entity16 have received 26 applications to replace miss @entity2 as youth commissioner			2
the 17 - year - old was appointed by police and crime commissioner @entity157 last month			1
