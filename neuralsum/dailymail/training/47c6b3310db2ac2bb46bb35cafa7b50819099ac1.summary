by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 13:25 est , 17 april 2012 brave : @entity2 from @entity3 will be the first man to take on the @entity5 marathon with a defibrillator implant under his skin a man with a rare genetic disorder will be the first to complete the @entity5 marathon with a built - in defibrillator that will zap him back to life if his heart stops mid-race			1
@entity2 nearly died when he went into cardiac arrest suddenly last year			2
since then he has worn a small heart - shocking device implanted under his skin similar to footballer @entity18 ’s			1
@entity2 , 23 , was born with a condition which means the walls of his heart are sponge - like instead of ‘ compact ’ like a normal heart			1
it means that at any time he could suffer another arrest and must limit his physical activity at all times			0
but despite his potentially deadly condition , @entity2 has pledged to take on the 26 - mile challenge on april 22 in the hope of raising thousands for the @entity29			1
his case comes just weeks after @entity31 midfielder @entity18 dramatically collapsed on the pitch suffering from a similar heart condition			1
@entity18 was technically ' dead ' for 78 minutes after collapsing during the @entity35 tie at @entity36 last month , but was released from hospital on monday after being fitted with a defibrillator implant			0
@entity2 , from @entity39 , @entity3 , said : ' i heard about it after it had happened and watched it back afterwards			2
' i saw the paramedics shocking him and it was very close to home for me			0
' i ca n’t remember how long my own heart stopped for , but seeing the @entity18 incident makes you remember being in that position			1
determined : @entity2 in training for his @entity5 marathon bid ' it ’s one of the reasons that i ’m so determined to complete the marathon because i want to raise awareness of heart conditions such as his and mine			1
' @entity2 was diagnosed with the condition , called left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy , at 15 after a series of mri scans			2
his a genetic illness so rare that at that time only a handful of cases had been discovered			0
his father @entity67 , 48 , an airline pilot , carries the faulty gene and had also passed the condition on to @entity2 ’s sister , @entity70 , 24 , a trainee solicitor			2
high - tech : the device and how it sits under the skin @entity2 decided to become a school teacher and started a two year course in geography			1
but just four months into his first year , he suffered a sudden cardiac arrest while lying on his bed			0
he was rushed to hospital and spent four nights at the @entity82 at @entity83			0
there doctors gave him three options : do nothing , have a heart monitor fitted or have a high - tech subcutaneous implantable cardioverter - defibrillator fitted under his arm			0
the implant would not only monitor his heart but would also shock him back to life if he ever suffered another cardiac arrest in the future			2
after discussing it with his family , @entity2 opted for the implant as he was terrified of suffering another cardiac arrest			0
@entity2 ( front left ) as a child with his family wearing his grandad 's marathon medal @entity2 said : ' it ’s an extremely rare condition and the medical understanding of it is changing all the time			1
' i wanted to do something that would help raise of awareness of my condition and others like it			0
' despite the limitations of his condition , @entity2 has always been fit and had long wanted to complete the @entity5 marathon like his granddad , an accomplished runner			1
he applied for the race through the @entity29 charity and when he was accepted he discovered he would be the first to complete it while wearing a defibrillator implant			0
@entity2 said : ' doing the marathon is my way of showing people that heart conditions do n’t necessarily have to hold you back			1
' i wo n’t be able to run a lot of it because of my medication but i ’m still hoping to do it in about six hours			2
' and although i know it ’s unlikely , i know the implant is there as a safety net if the worst comes to the worst			0
