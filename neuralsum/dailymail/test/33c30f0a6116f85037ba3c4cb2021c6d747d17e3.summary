@entity0 , with its shimmering sandy beaches , enthralling wildlife and relics of ancient civilisations , is high on lists of places to visit in 2015			2
@entity7 enjoys the new stability on the teardrop - shaped island in the @entity11 , where the holiday industry is recovering , and expanding with a crop of smart new hotels , after the dual torment of a tsunami and a bitter civil war			1
the modern @entity19 temple , @entity20 , @entity0			2
the temple floats on @entity20 's @entity22 1 ... pure serendipity this is the spiritual home of serendipity – lucky discoveries by accident – as @entity28 is the island ’s ancient name			1
on one of my early starts for an excursion , serendipity was seeing dozens of candles flickering in the dense dark outside a @entity40 temple			2
then a schoolgirl in brilliant white uniform striding through the dawn mists along a levee between paddy fields , while an equally white egret paced daintily in the water			2
or an old lady , knee - deep in a swamp picking blue water lilies , the national flower			1
and everywhere , games of impromptu cricket , with a stick for a bat and a plastic drum for a wicket , on bare mud patches , in gardens , on roads			2
bath time ! a frolicking elephant at the @entity63 nature reserve has around 200 of the giant creatures 2 ... @entity66 jaunt the island ’s unique subspecies of elephants are a vestige of ancient @entity0			1
you ca n’t miss them			2
my most memorable jumbo encounter was at the @entity63 nature reserve			1
we watched in awe as an extended family ambled across our track			2
one juvenile pushed over a tree , just for fun , it seemed			0
last across was a harassed young mother , sheltering a three - week - old baby			1
in the right season you might see 200 elephants at the lake in @entity89			1
the distinguished star in @entity91 is the ‘ prince of the night ’ – the leopard			0
picture perfect ! a tea @entity93 near @entity95 near @entity96 @entity0 3 ... old @entity97 the nearest thing to cool in @entity0 is its green and hilly heart , where tea plantations are a fascinating sight			1
@entity96 , where the @entity102 beat the last king of @entity0 in 1815 , still feels like a charming , antique outpost of empire			1
it is dotted with guesthouses that recall @entity109			0
the colonial throwbacks include a bus station clock that chimes like @entity112			0
there are red @entity115 post boxes and immaculate old @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			0
i stayed at the @entity120 , all echoing wooden corridors and wide , polished staircases			0
in the @entity123 , i found the tree that @entity125 planted			0
in the serenity of the @entity127 , what is said to be the @entity130 ’s tooth is kept safe within the innermost of seven caskets			0
@entity133 is an ancient palace located in the central @entity135 near the town of @entity137 in the @entity138			0
the name refers to a site that hosues a massive column of rock nearly 660 ft high 4 ... @entity143 @entity133 is a quarter the size of @entity145 , topped with the 1,500 - year - old fortress of the playboy @entity147			1
he killed his father and surrounded himself with a crocodile - filled moat to exclude his vengeful brother			1
i decided against the one - hour , 900ft climb to the top for the ancient frescoes and spicy graffiti			1
instead i strolled into the jungle that smothers the massive defensive stones at the rock ’s base			0
huge , golden - green butterflies fluttered past			1
a strange symphony of birds burbled out of the trees – @entity0 has many wonderful avian species			0
in a gap in the canopy i caught a flash of orange at the top of the rock			0
it was a @entity40 monk in his vivid garb			0
not the usual black cab : taxi rank of tuk - tuks line the streets in @entity181 in @entity0 5 ... take the @entity182 - @entity182 most visitors stay on the west and south coasts where , as well as standard tourist hotels , there is a growing choice of chic , small places such as @entity190 , a ten - suite boutique hotel near the south coast that opens in june			1
then you can book trips by coach or car ( with your own private driver ) to most parts of @entity0			0
for short distances the ubiquitous motorised tuk - tuks are fun			1
do n’t even consider hiring a car			0
roads are an all - day adrenaline rush			1
you need an expert at the wheel to dodge the massive @entity206 lorries painted with idealised landscapes , jam - packed buses and wobbling bikes with impossible loads			2
paradise ! a golden beach with turquise waters at @entity213 near @entity214 on the south coast of @entity0 6 ... just the ( @entity216 ) ticket the little station on the @entity20 to @entity214 line close by my hotel felt like a slumbering country halt from 1950s @entity102			0
behind the ticket office ’s narrow arched window , a clerk consulted his tomes and solemnly outlined my choices – i opted for a 90 - minute trip in second class for 50p			2
on the platform i joined goats and men there just for a chat			0
we lurched off down the tragic ( it bore the brunt of the 2004 tsunami ) and beautiful coast to @entity214			1
another epic rail journey is @entity20 to @entity242 , the east coast city closed to the world by civil war until recently and still to be discovered by tourism			0
it ’s just £ 2 one way			0
precious peg ! the @entity127 near @entity96 , houses a tooth relic of the @entity130			1

the teardrop - shaped island was ravaged by the tsunami in 2004
the holiday industry there is recovered and expanding with new hotels
