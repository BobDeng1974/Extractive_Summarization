a modern take on the safety wear that makes garments visible from 1.5miles away in complete darkness has been unveiled			0
the technologically - enhanced makeover of the building site staple uses a concealed battery to light up bright strips on the clothing that can be seen from long distances			1
the technology uses a battery hidden inside the clothing which lights up reflective strips and can be seen for 1.5 miles @entity18 , the company behind the clothing , is now making 5,000 products a month , including jackets , trousers and shoes bosses at @entity25 , @entity26 and infrastructure giant @entity27 have already snapped up the items of clothing for use on their work sites			1
