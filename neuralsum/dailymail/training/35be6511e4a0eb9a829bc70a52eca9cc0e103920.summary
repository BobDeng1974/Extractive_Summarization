by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 12:22 est , 3 january 2014 @entity1 are on the trail of @entity4 starlet @entity3			1
the 15 - year - old is one of three footballing brothers			1
@entity8 , 13 , is at @entity4 too and @entity9 , 17 , was released by @entity4 but is now due to sign a professional contract with @entity1			1
@entity3 , a left sided midfielder who can play on the wing or behind the striker , is one of the brightest talents in @entity15 football and has figured for @entity4 's @entity16 , making his debut against @entity18 in february , but he has yet to sign professional terms and turns 16 on january 31			1
rising star : @entity1 are keeping an eye on @entity4 youngster @entity3 ( right ) he was player of the tournament at the @entity23 in 2012 , competing against @entity1 , @entity24 and @entity25 before catching the eye again in the @entity26 in @entity27 last summer and the @entity28			1
capped by @entity30 at @entity32 level , @entity18 and @entity29 are also keen on the slightly built @entity3 but @entity1 hope to have the upper hand to any ensuing transfer with elder brother @entity9 in their ranks			1
family affair : @entity3 ' older brother @entity9 ( right ) is poised to sign a professional contract with the @entity40 @entity42 's availability at @entity18 has alerted @entity43			1
fresh from missing out on @entity46 , manager @entity44 is weighing up alternatives and would be interested if a subsidised loan can be arranged until the end of the season when @entity42 's contract runs out			1
city are willing to let the @entity30 defender leave on loan should @entity55 shake off his injury but @entity42 's estimated £ 90,000 - a - week wages are prohibitive to the @entity43 and the likes of @entity59 and even @entity60 , to a degree			1
reinforcement : @entity42 has attracted attention from @entity43 big decision : @entity65 centre back @entity46 decided against joining the @entity43 besiktas are willing to pay around £ 2million a year tax free in wages and offer the 31 - year - old a two - year contract and the promise of longer - term deals elsewhere at this stage could be difficult to find			1
@entity42 has plenty to play for with a @entity76 place at stake and is a model professional so clubs will be getting a proven @entity81 performer but finances dictate a short term deal may be their best bet			1
@entity85 are looking at centre backs but @entity29 and @entity18 target @entity87 of @entity89 is a preferred option			1
@entity60 also have other possibilities in mind			2
@entity94 eye : @entity44 has endured a miserable period following a series of defensive injuries @entity44 will look at foreign options too should @entity42 not fit financially but is eager to bring in @entity81 experience among his three planned signings			1
@entity100 looks like it will be too expensive a project to conclude with @entity103 while @entity65 still want £ 4m - £ 5m for @entity104 who is a target for @entity106 also			2
another loan signing up top is desired with numerous players still being discussed , however @entity107 of @entity18 is leaning more towards a loan move to @entity112			2
@entity113 have no intention of entertaining any bids for @entity116			2
@entity29 have shown interest in the former @entity119 striker but the @entity120 say they have had no offer after telling all suitors not to waste their time			1
@entity116 has become a cult figure for the passionate @entity113 fans who craved a striker to idolise following @entity128 's sale last summer			2
@entity116 insists he is happy in @entity120 , saying : ' for someone like me , who loves this sport , @entity129 is a wonderful place			2
this is an incredible city where football comes first , followed by everything else			2
the fans live for football			0
thank @entity139 they loved me straight away because the @entity141 are very passionate and i find that enchanting			0
no go : @entity113 will knock back any overtures for star striker @entity116 this transfer window ' the @entity141 have a special affection for @entity147			0
they are similar to us as well as having @entity149 in their hearts			0
' club president @entity152 is convinced @entity153 is heading in the right direction with his new - look @entity113 project despite narrowly missing out on qualification from the @entity158 group stage			0
@entity153 wants a defensive midfielder , a centre back and a left back to help press @entity161 and @entity163 for the title and win the @entity165 for a successive year			0
he remains a big fan of @entity29 's @entity167 but has not made any approach for the @entity169			1
temper , temper : @entity167 fumes after being substituted for @entity172 during @entity29 's win at @entity103 @entity113 say they have had no approach from @entity175 for 17 - year - old right back @entity176			1
@entity175 , meanwhile , are reluctant to loan out @entity178 despite enquiries from @entity81 sides			1
they are also yet to reach agreement with @entity182 for forward @entity183 but talks are ongoing			1
one winger keen on a return to @entity30 is former @entity29 man @entity187 , 28 , who has attracted interest from @entity60 , @entity4 , @entity43 and @entity175 in the past and is available for £ 2.5m from @entity190			1
reluctant : @entity175 remain loath to loan out @entity178 ( right ) but are hoping to bring @entity183 in a few championship club scouts have been beating a path to @entity194 's @entity193 this season			1
the focus of their attention is former @entity199 striker @entity198			0
the 21 - year - old , who has been likened in style to a young @entity202 by some observers , was born in @entity204 upon @entity205 and had trials for @entity207 and @entity208 as a boy			2
he was signed by @entity211 @entity210 at 13 and from there was picked up by @entity199 where he graduated to become captain of their @entity216 team before making his debut as a substitute against @entity219 in the @entity158			0
most wanted : @entity198 is being watched by a number of championship clubs however , three knee injuries derailed his progress and following @entity199 ' liquidation he moved to @entity194 on loan			0
he scored four goals in seven games prompting @entity199 to recall him but finances dictated he had to go and he rejoined @entity194 where he has scored 16 goals in 23 games this season			0
@entity198 , whose father @entity234 scored for @entity235 at @entity236 in the 1996 @entity237 final win over @entity238 , is out of contract in the summer but the @entity241 side would be willing to sell now for around £ 50,000 and that has some clubs thinking he would be worth the gamble in @entity30			0
which one - time @entity1 transfer target is considering getting a new tattoo after team - mates gave him constant ribbing over one he has on his arm of the @entity250 which he had done to remind him of his children ? @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 will all be represented as @entity256 visit @entity210 in the conference on saturday			1
on show is @entity256 striker @entity259 who has scored 15 goals in 19 games this season and would have had more but for a broken hand which forced him to miss 10 games			2
the 25 - year - old scored two in three minutes against @entity267 on @entity268 and has had the likes of @entity270 following his form			0
however , now @entity241 sides are also watching to see what the fuss is about			0
@entity259 is hoping to tread a similar path to former @entity277 striker @entity276 , now at @entity253			0
@entity277 manager @entity278 , who is aiming for promotion , joked : ' any scouts that were at the game should look at the third chance he had , the one where he missed , and leave him where he is with us			0
he ’s rubbish ! no , he took both his goals well , as he has done all season			0
he gets into good areas and what can i say , he knows where the goal is			0

the 26 - year - old midfielder , who has had spells with @entity300 and @entity301 , has been on loan at @entity207 and impressed boss @entity303			0
loan star : @entity297 ( right ) may earn a permanent deal to stay at @entity207 from @entity60 @entity306 are continuing to bang on the door at @entity308			2
not content with asking about @entity310 , manager @entity311 is also keen on midfielder @entity312			2
@entity311 wants to add a goal threat to his championship promotion chasers and has also enquired about a big money bid for @entity318 goal machine @entity316			0
however , word is @entity318 wo n't sell for under £ 10m			0
fancy it ? @entity306 are keen on @entity308 hitman @entity310 @entity321 , formerly of @entity308 , is eager to make a return to the @entity81			1
the 30 - year - old is a free agent who moved briefly to @entity325 in october only for the move to end before it got started after an incident where he was filmed allegedly drunk in a @entity330 pub. @entity321 is ready to go on trial at a club to prove he is fit for action and sticking to orange juice			2
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity335 is ready to go out on loan again after returning from a spell at @entity338			1

@entity335 impressed at @entity351 and is keen to get more competitive games under his belt with his route to the first team at @entity1 blocked by @entity356 and @entity357			1
@entity359 's agent has reaffirmed his belief the @entity362 striker will stay at @entity363 this season			0
@entity301 need @entity359 even more following the leg break suffered by @entity366 yet @entity359 has attracted attention from @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity161 , @entity29 , @entity60 and @entity1 again despite his dip in form			1
staying put : @entity359 's agent is adamant that his client will remain at @entity301 for the time being @entity375 , said : ' you have to be realistic			0
he played on @entity268 , so to talk of him leaving is ridiculous			0
there 's no question of him leaving at the moment			0
it was n't planned at the start of the season , it 's not planned now			0
' @entity384 are looking to sign @entity253 's versatile @entity385 on loan for the rest of the season as @entity388 looks to reshape his squad at the @entity390			0
