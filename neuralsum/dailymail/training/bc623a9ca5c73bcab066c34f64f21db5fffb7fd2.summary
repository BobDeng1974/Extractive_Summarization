real estate tycoon @entity0 brought an aggressive if vague platform to the @entity2 on friday , but raised eyebrows with his continued questions about president @entity6 's birth certificate			1
he hammered @entity7 and @entity8 , saying the former president would soon face new troubles related to his friendship with convicted pedophile @entity12			1
@entity8 is a ' nice guy , ' @entity0 said , but ' he 's got a lot of problems coming up , in my opinion , with the famous island ' where @entity18 entertained his wealthy and famous friends – allegedly with sex parties featuring underage girls			1
the former @entity23 president took a trip there in 2002			0
he said he still wonders ' whether or not it was the real birth certificate ' that the @entity30 released in 2011			1
' i certainly question it			0
... we have to find out whether or not it was real , ' he told a near - capacity crowd in a @entity49 resort ballroom			0
after his speech , @entity0 told @entity51 that ' the positive response today at @entity2 was enormous			1
' he noted that @entity54 host @entity53 brought up the birth certificate during a q&a session			2
the @entity23 @entity57 says only a ' natural born citizen ' can become president , making questions about a candidate 's birthplace red meat for opponents			2
@entity0 has floated a variety of theories explaining why he thinks the president has hidden the circumstances of his birth , at one 2014 press conference he suggested that @entity6 might have lied about his birthplace in order to get preferential treatment in university admissions			1
when he flirted with a run in the 2012 presidential contest he offered a $ 5 million charity bounty for the release of the birth certificate , the president 's college records , and his passport applications			1
the birth certificate – but nothing else – followed			2
' i 'd still like to see his college records , ' he said at @entity2 on friday			0
' i think it 's important			0
' @entity87 ? the idea that @entity6 was n't born in the @entity23 , and is therefore ineligible to be president , originated with @entity7 's 2008 presidential primary campaign – which was later defeated by @entity6 's @entity0 spoke at the @entity2 in @entity49 , near the nation 's capital he also reminded the crowd that @entity7 's 2008 presidential campaign was the first to suggest @entity6 was born outside the @entity23 , saying that it would make him ineligible to run			1
that came as the two were locked in a @entity99 primary slugfest			0
eight years later mrs. @entity7 is the @entity99 ' heir apparent , attracting shots from all @entity102 quarters – including @entity0 's			2
' as far as his birth certificate , @entity7 wanted his birth certificate , ' he jabbed at @entity2			1
' @entity7 is a birther			0
' he told @entity51 that both ' @entity7 and @entity107 were birthers – but failed birthers			0
' ' i was able to get him to release the document or whatever it was that he released , ' he said			0
' he did n't do it for them ; he did it for me			0

' we have to find out whether or not it was real , ' the real estate tycoon said friday of the @entity6 birth certificate the @entity30 released in 2012

also said @entity8 's woes linked to @entity18 's ' famous island ' are n't over
@entity0 is between *75* and *80* per cent sure he 's running for president , he told the @entity2 near @entity135
