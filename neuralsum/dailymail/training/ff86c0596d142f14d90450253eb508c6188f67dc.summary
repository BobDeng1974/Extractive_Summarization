the wait is finally over for disgruntled car owner @entity1 who has said goodbye to the most hated possession he has ever owned - his @entity3			2
years of campaigning the car manufacturer to refund or replace his ' lemon ' car - he bought from a @entity9 dealer - proved fruitless , so the @entity10 decided to employ a different strategy to get the message across			1
he invited the public along to a rural property , at @entity15 an hour north of @entity16 , where 300 people watched and took part in the car 's demolition derby by wielding bats , and sledgehammers and shooting bow and arrows at it			1
an auger was used to rip a whole through the top of the rood and bring the car to its knees the footage was streamed live on the internet capturing the varied moments people took to help bring the car to its knees			2
saturday 's momentous occasion comes four years after mr @entity1 bought the ' lemon ' car for $ 49,000 and months after he started planning the demolition event			1
he said his feeling of satisfaction could not have felt sweeter : ' it 's fantastic , i 'm here celebrating at the pub eating chicken wings			0
mr @entity1 took the extreme measure to destroy his car - using augers , crow bars , bow and arrows and sheer man power - after years of frustration with his ' cursed ' @entity27			1
the footage was streamed live on the internet capturing the varied moments people took to help bring the car to its knees			2
after the car was destroyed a fire was lit to bring the rubble to nothing but scrap metal the left over parts of the car were buried beneath the ground for four hours they shot arrows at it , sledged windows and tore tyres while an auger ripped through its roof lifting it off the ground			0
' the car was spinning in the air with the auger through the top of the roof , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' the whole car lifted two , maybe three foot off the ground before we crushed it and lit on fire			0
' he said the ' @entity98 ' was putting a flame to it and watching it burn before burying the scrap heap and laying flowers at the head of its makeshift burial plot			0
' we buried it six feet under , where it belongs			0
' mr @entity1 started an online kick - starter campaign to recoup the losses on his $ 50,000 vehicle			1
he raised $ 18,000 through the crowd - funded project for people to bid on parts of the car they wanted to smash to smithereens			0
after four years of repayments he still owed $ 29,000 in total , so he was out of pocket close to $ 10,000 , but by saturday that no longer mattered			2
baseball bats , arrows and sledgehammers were used in the very public destruction more than 300 people turned out to either witness the public smashing or to take part in it one avid participant used a baseball bat to take to the front side panel ready , aim ! an archer lines up his arrow before firing			1
it was originally proposed that people could shoot bullets at the vehicle but it did n't happen part of the grill of the car finally comes unstuck in the demolition derby the main impetus behind the idea was to raise awareness around ' lemon laws ' and to try to stop big companies from selling cars that should never be put on the road			2
' the serious side to it is that i should n't have had to destroy a $ 50,000 car , ' he said			0
' if the law was there today and if @entity160 respected and looked after its customers then it would n't have had to happen			0
' mr @entity1 said plenty more jeep owners that have come forward with complaints that they are taking to the @entity165			1
a @entity166 , who won a bid for the scrap heap on @entity170 where he bough the metallic wreck for $ 257 , was given the choice of what to do with the heap so he decided to ' bury the bastard			0
' in the four years since mr @entity1 bought the car , in 2010 , he claims it has provided him all sorts of problems , including the fuel line falling off , coolant leaks , the rear strut leaking oil , ongoing ignition failure , and the turbo inlet manifold cracking			1
@entity3 offered mr @entity1 a settlement of $ 22,500 for the car , for which he originally paid $ 49,000 , and he knows that if he sold the car himself he could get $ 28,000 for it , but he said he felt uncomfortable with both options			2
' why would i have wanted to sell it on to someone else ? ' they 'll just have the same problems			0
' now that the destruction of the @entity197 has taken place , mr @entity1 says he just wants to put this chapter behind him			1
he will have to buy a replacement car and while he is not certain which model he 'll purchase he does know one thing			0
' it wo n't be a jeep			0
' a younger participant takes to the front of the car with a hammer a chainsaw drills through the side of the car mr @entity1 preparing himself for the four hour battle on saturday mr @entity1 and his wife @entity214 gearing up for the event on the @entity9			1
