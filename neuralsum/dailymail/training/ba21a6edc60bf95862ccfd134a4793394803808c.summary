by @entity0 a @entity2 grandmother could lose an eye after she bravely rescued her grandson who was being viciously attacked by an otter as he swam in a river on thursday			1
@entity8 's grandmotherly instinct kicked in as soon as she heard the screams of her 8 - year - old grandson , @entity10 , and then saw the horrible sight of an otter biting him aggressively in a swimming hole in the @entity15 - about 30 miles northeast of @entity16			1
' i could see that it was biting into his head and it had its claws around him , ' @entity17 told @entity22			2
' i just remember trying to hold it as tight as i can and yelling " get him out of the water ! get him out of the water ! " ' @entity17 managed to get young @entity10 out of the water but not before suffering her own injuries			1
' it just started biting on me and biting on me and it felt like little knives just going in , ' @entity17 told the tv station			2
the pair were taken to a hospital where @entity17 reportedly received hundreds of stitches to her face and head as well as the eye injury and @entity10 received nine staples in his head			1
state and federal wildlife agents in @entity2 are trying to trap the otter and it will likely be killed unless it is a female with pups , because it has pounced on people , said capt. @entity59 of the @entity2 @entity60			1
' we 're doing everything possible to capture than animal as soon as possible , ' @entity59 said friday			0
' this is an extremely rare incident			0
otters are not known to be aggressive toward people			0
' the boy 's mother , @entity67 , saw the four - foot otter attack her son and her mother saved him			1
a state worker was unable to find the otter , so expert trappers were called in from the @entity76 @entity75 , @entity59 said			2
they 'll try to trap it with a foot snare or tranquilize it			0
' we 're not sure if it 's a hyper - aggressive male protecting territory or a female protecting its young , ' @entity59 said			2
an eight - year - old boy and his grandmother were attacked by an otter in @entity2 's @entity15 ' there 's a lot of liability in trying to relocate an animal that 's been hyper - aggressive , and it would likely be euthanized			1
if it 's a female with pups , there 's another possible outcome if we can find a good location			0
' but the otter would have to be killed in any case so its brain could be tested for rabies , if that 's a concern for doctors treating the boy and his grandmother , he said			0
' there are no known cases of otter rabies in @entity2 , ; he said			1
' that 's an extremely remote possibility			0
' the grandmother was treated at @entity112 in @entity16 and the boy at @entity114 in @entity115 , the boy 's mother , @entity67 told @entity118			0
the attack took place in @entity2 's @entity15 - about 30 miles northeast of @entity16 ( pictured ) ' all of a sudden i just heard him scream for his life			1
he was just bobbing up and down in the water and as he came up there was something all the way on top of his head , ' she told @entity118			0
the otter continued to attack as they left the water			0
' even after it got into the river and out of our way it stood on its hind legs looking at us like , ' do n't do it again ; do n't come in here , '' she told @entity118			0
@entity59 said he has not heard of any other otter attacks in @entity2 but there have been some around the country			1
