by @entity0 published : 10:47 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 01:57 est , 1 may 2013 an allotment holder who has refused to grow vegetables has lost a legal battle to be allowed to stay on his land			0
@entity7 decided to plant fruit trees after he found himself with so many spare vegetables that he had to throw them away			1
after @entity11 won the right to evict him from his plot last week , he pledged to take his case to the @entity15 and insisted : ' this is not over			0
' battle : @entity7 has been thrown off his allotment because he is only growing fruit trees mr @entity7 , 61 , appeared at @entity20 last week for his suit against the council , which owns @entity23 in @entity24			1
the writer has had his plot at the site for six years , and in 2008 decided to stop growing vegetables when he found himself with so many potatoes , leeks and onions that he could neither eat them nor give them away			2
legal battle : mr @entity7 is hoping to take his case to the @entity15 to replace them , he paid £ 600 for 13 fruit trees , planting a mixture of pear , plum , apple , cherry and apricot trees			1
but when council workers carried out a ' plot inspection ' , they told mr @entity7 he was not ' cultivating the land properly ' , and warned him he must grow vegetables again if he did not want to be evicted from the allotment			1
council rules introduced last year dictate that three quarters of every plot should be ' planted with productive crops or other plants ' , in order to prevent plot holders from neglected the highly sought - after land			2
@entity57 , a landscape technician for the council , told the hearing last week : ' i do n't believe that growing fruit trees as a monoculture is an appropriate use of an allotment			1
' mr @entity7 , who represented himself in court , said he had followed ' expert advice ' in growing his fruit trees , and that the contract he signed with the council in 2007 did not say he was n't allowed to grow only fruit trees			1
he said he had even started growing ferns , roses and artichokes to ' meet the council half - way ' , but told the court : ' i feel like i 'm a spider in the room that you want to crush because you do n't like the look of me			2
' district judge @entity80 said the argument came down to a ' dispute over the fundamental meaning of the word cultivation ' and said it was a ' difficult case '			0
protest : the keen gardener started growing fruit after he found himself with too many vegetables in the end , however , the judge sided with the council , telling the court : ' i find as a fact that the cultivation of 13 fruit trees on that area of land with only grass in between them is not something which meets the stipulation of 75 per cent cultivation within two years			1
' mr @entity7 was ordered to pay £ 750 in court costs and told to be off the land in two months unless he met council cultivation rules			1
speaking to the @entity106 after the case , mr @entity7 pledged to take his case to a higher court , saying : ' this is not over			2
i 'm not evicted yet and i will appeal			0
i will take it to the @entity15 if necessary			0
' i hope in the end to win the case and for the council to be more understanding of the way people live their lives			0
' a spokesman for the council said previously : ' the rules were agreed unanimously and we believe they are fair and reasonable and have the support of the vast majority of allotment holders			0
' the major change is the introduction of rules which help us ensure that tenants do cultivate their plots			0

@entity7 , 61 , planted fruit trees after *amassing* surplus of vegetables
