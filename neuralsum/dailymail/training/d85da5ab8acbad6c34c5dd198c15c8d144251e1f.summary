by @entity0 as @entity1 sunk his teeth into the fine detail of his £ 75million move to @entity5 on tuesday night he accepted a call			1
it came – as it often does - from his brother - in - law , a fellow professional footballer in a landscape as far removed from the sun - kissed @entity10 and grandeur of @entity13 as it ’s possible to imagine			1
hours before playing for @entity16 champions @entity15 against @entity17 in a @entity18 second round qualifying tie before a crowd of just 1,700 , @entity14 lifted the phone to seek the advice and encouragement of his famous – some might say infamous – in - law			1
on the turn : @entity14 ( front ) featured for 58 minutes in @entity15 's clash with @entity17 close knit : @entity14 's sister @entity30 is married to @entity5 striker @entity1 , who gave advice to his brother - in - law before the @entity18 qualifier with @entity17 the brother of @entity35 , the wife and teenage sweetheart of world football ’s most notorious player , @entity14 failed to learn much			1
an anonymous figure against the @entity41 champions he was hauled from the pitch after 58 minutes			0
meeting the media in a lounge of @entity15 ’s @entity46 after a 1 - 0 first leg defeat which all but ends their @entity18 hopes , however , the quietly spoken @entity48 spoke warmly of his vilified relative			1
his sister met @entity1 as a teenager and had his two children			1
despite being separated by the length of @entity58 , the siblings – the family – remain close			0
like others who know the former @entity61 striker , @entity14 paints a conflicting picture to that conjured up by the incredible moment @entity1 sunk his teeth into the shoulder of @entity68 defender @entity67			1
@entity1 earned a four - month @entity70 suspension for his latest misdemeanour – the third of its kind – and is banned from going anywhere near the iconic @entity76 home of @entity5			1
even for his signing ceremony			0
‘ i spoke to @entity1 before the @entity17 match and i talk to him a lot , ’ said the midfielder			1
‘ i ’ve known him since he was 15 years old so we go back a long way			2
family matters : @entity1 sits by his wife @entity30 during a @entity61 game last season ‘ he could n’t come to the match in @entity16 because he ’s back in @entity5 sorting things out			1
’ smiling , he adds : ‘ i think he has much more important things on his mind right now … ‘ but , of course , it ’s nice to know i can call him anytime , he helps me a lot			2
‘ @entity1 is a great guy			2
he has a very bad image right now because of what happened in the @entity98 - but he ’s really not like that at all			0
‘ if you know him , he ’s a really nice guy and would do anything to help you			0
you have to get close to @entity1 to really know him and thankfully i am			2
’ @entity1 famously began dating @entity30 in 2001 while working as a teenage street sweeper			1
in contrast with the penniless aspiring footballer , @entity30 lived a comfortable middle class existence with her brother and other family members			2
they welcomed @entity1 into their home and moved to @entity111 en masse in 2003 to offer him the best possible chance to become a professional footballer			2
late show : @entity115 ( 42 ) struck six minutes from time to give @entity17 a 1 - 0 win over @entity15 dream start : @entity115 's strike came on his @entity17 debut in the @entity18 qualifier ‘ @entity1 is a family man and he has a good character , ’ adds @entity14			1
‘ only the people who are closest to him , like his family and friends , see that			0
‘ we ’ve know each other since we were kids and i ’ve watched him grow as a player			0
he ’s now one of the best in the world but , believe me , he ’s had to fight for everything he has in his career			0
‘ he ’s been a big influence on me			0
he ’s always giving me advice and trying to help me with my career			0
’ @entity14 was an unlikely addition to an @entity16 side populated by a banker , an architect and students			2
a part - time outfit , @entity15 signed him at significant expense and the identity of his brother - in - law has brought the club headlines , but no obvious hope of overcoming @entity17 after @entity115 ’s debut goal seven minutes from time			1
‘ obviously i ’d love to reach the level @entity1 is at , i want to play at the highest level i can in my career			2
‘ but i know how tough that is and games like the one against @entity17 has shown me how big a step it is to @entity18 level			1
’ kr travel to @entity155 in @entity156 next week ( with @entity157 being used for the @entity158 ) to face @entity160 ’s side with an uphill task			0
‘ maybe @entity1 will watch the second game on tv , ’ adds @entity14 , ‘ i hope so			1
the first leg was a very tough game for us			0
we had to defend very well for most of the game and we had to run a lot			0
‘ we thought were going to hold on for a positive result so it was disappointing to lose the goal near the end			0
‘ of course , it ’s going to be very difficult for us to go through now but we can ’ t give up			0
i was impressed with @entity17 , they passed the ball very well and you can see they ’re a very good team who have played in the @entity18 a lot			1
‘ we will have to do a lot of running to do again in @entity41 but we have to believe we can score and give ourselves a chance			0
