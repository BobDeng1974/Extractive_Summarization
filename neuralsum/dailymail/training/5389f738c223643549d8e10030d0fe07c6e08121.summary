@entity1 manager @entity0 had been strict beforehand in making sure his players did n't pose for any selfies with the visiting @entity5 superstars but they were allowed to grab a souvenir afterwards			1
captain @entity7 , a @entity5 fan , revealed he had exchanged shirts with @entity9 at the end			1
@entity1 captain @entity7 ( right ) walks off with @entity9 's ( centre ) shirt at @entity14 it was a miserable afternoon for @entity5 misfit @entity16 , who was named in @entity18 's squad for the first time since the goalless draw at @entity21 on august 30			1
his reward was to spend the entire afternoon sat freezing in the cramped away dug - out			2
surely his @entity24 career is over ? the matchday programme was a glossy 96 - page tome , which was a worthy souvenir of the occasion			0
the back four pages were left blank and labelled ' autographs '			0
you would have been hard pressed to get any beforehand , with a throng 20 - deep waiting for @entity5 's team coach to arrive			2
two programme sellers show off the glossy 96 - page special produced for the visit of @entity5 this was the third @entity39 clash between @entity1 and @entity5 , and @entity5 ’s 2 - 0 victory made it a hat - trick of wins over the @entity44 club			1
the aggregate score now stands at 13 - 0 following a 3 - 0 victory at @entity24 in january 1938 and an 8 - 0 romp in february 1949 at @entity48 ( after @entity24 had suffered bomb damage in the war )			0
@entity51 scored five for @entity53 ’s men in the latter game			0
there was a gruesome moment 20 minutes in when @entity5 's medical staff got out their stapler to repair damage to @entity60 after the defender clashed heads with @entity1 striker @entity63			1
@entity65 physio @entity64 and doctor @entity66 rushed on to administer treatment and the staples were cover by a bandage			0
@entity1 striker @entity63 and @entity5 defender @entity60 clash heads in the first half @entity5 defender @entity60 has his head stapled after suffering a cut in the accidental collision shortly after @entity78 tackled this tricky tie at tiny @entity14 , his much - maligned predecessor @entity77 enjoyed one of his greatest victories against a @entity83 football superpower			1
the recently appointed @entity85 boss saw his team pull off a shock 1 - 0 @entity89 league win at home to @entity91 , thanks to @entity94 ’s second - minute own goal and a typically solid defensive display that kept @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 at bay			0
