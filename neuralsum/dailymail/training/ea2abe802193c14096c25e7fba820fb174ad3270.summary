by @entity0 for @entity1 crouching in the depths of a pitch - black @entity5 cave , a wildlife photographer has managed to capture images of extraordinary colour			1
these pictures capture moments that are almost impossible to see with the naked eye , and show birds , bats , frogs and even mice mid-flight , fleeing , feeding and interacting with each other			2
the shots were taken by @entity17 , 38 , who spent hours crouched in caves - often up to his knees in water - waiting for the perfect moments to snap these amazing images			1
' when i finally looked at my set , i felt as though i had won the lottery			0
' i had to study each animal and their behaviours to determine how best to take each photo			0
flying frog : this colourful green and yellow frog leaps towards the camera lens from a mossy branch in a @entity5 cave hovering hummingbirds : these colourful creatures suspend themselves in mid-air , their green , blue and purple feathers catching the light for the camera ' there are two ways to shoot , either manually , by waiting and knowing exactly the feeding locations of each specimen , or automatically with specialised gear that automated the camera shooting when an invisible barrier is trespassed			1
' both systems require tonnes of patience and time			0
first to locate the perfect location for the camera and flashes , then also time to fine tune on the possible subjects in order to get them nicely focused			2
' the barrier triggers the camera and the flashes so all the previous efforts of gear collocation and focus will be of great importance			0
taking a lick : a bat flicks out its long tongue as it nears a tasty - looking red and orange fruit , its leathery wings guiding it towards the prize biding time : mr @entity17 says capturing these images takes a huge amount of patience , first to find the right spot and second to wait for the perfect moment flash photography : the camera 's flash is vital as it is what picks out these vivid colours from an otherwise deep and dark night sky like an angel : a beautiful purple hummingbird spreads its wings as spots of light artistically glint across the camera lens ' in order to take one shot i had to stay under rain for two hours placing the camera and flashes , and then wait another hour more in order to get one of the frogs jumping exactly from the branch i had placed right next to the pond			1
' bats are very difficult to get to at first , but when you get the focus in the sweet spot it 's just a game of waiting and good luck			0
' the more bats the easier to get one in focus			0
i had to enter a cave with water to my knees for 20 minutes , mount my gear , and wait for one hour until the first bat came out			1
it was pretty hard because i was inside a cave with the only light that comes from your headlamp , humidity and your precious gear only few centimetres from the water			2
' if i do my homework correctly i get shots never seen before , this makes me proud and gives me more stamina to keep shooting and thinking of new adventures elsewhere			0
' unique : mr @entity17 says that if he does his homework correctly he gets shots the likes of which have never been seen before perfect shot : mr @entity17 says bats are very difficult to get to at first , but when you get the focus in the sweet spot it is just a game of waiting and good luck @entity173 and dark : the photographer had to wade through knee - deep water in pitch black caves in order to get some of the amazing shots you 're the one that i want : a bat spots a delicate pink flower from which it can satisfy its hunger by sucking out some sweet nectar show off : this bright green hummingbird does tricks in the air , almost as if it is playing up to mr @entity17 and his camera the birds and the bats : a hummingbird hovers to avoid a splash of water ( left ) while a bat spreads its wings and flies through the cave ( right ) i look up at you : a hummingbird perches on a branch , looking up at the golden feathers of its hovering pal			1

had to wade through pitch - black caves with water up to his knees to try and find the perfect place to shoot
