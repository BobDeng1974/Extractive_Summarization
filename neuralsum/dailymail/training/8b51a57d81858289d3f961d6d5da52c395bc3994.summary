a controversial app inspired by the hit @entity2 animation frozen enables users to perform a @entity4 on princess @entity5 , one of the movie 's title characters			1
@entity8 , which is the work of software designer @entity10 , is an unlicensed - and unofficial - @entity12 app which claims to pick up where the popular animated movie left off , nine moths after @entity5 is thought to have married her love interest @entity12			1
' @entity5 got married and she was pregnant in the spring , ' the app 's description explains			2
' now nine months had elapsed , and it 's time to give birth to a baby			2
let 's come to help her ! ' players of the game are asked to take on the role of the doctor , and begin by monitoring the baby 's heartbeat using the app 's ' fetus egg monitor '			1
then , after @entity5 's stomach has been treated with a bizarre freezing spray , users are instructed to pick up a scalpel and perform her c - section			2
a baby then appears on @entity5 's stomach , before the app prompts you to cut its umbilical cord with the same scalpel that was used to perform the original procedure			0
you then weigh and wrap the genderless child , whose genitals are covered with what appears to be three small starfish , and then hand it back to its delighted parents , @entity5 and @entity12			0
the app has , unsurprisingly , sparked outrage on social media , with many parents taking to @entity65 to voice their concerns about such a graphic game being connected to one of the world 's most popular children 's movies			1

' it seems that some people have found humor in the controversial app however , with many opting to post what appear to be parody reviews on the game 's @entity98 page , no doubt in the hopes of eliciting further frustration from any concerned parents			1
