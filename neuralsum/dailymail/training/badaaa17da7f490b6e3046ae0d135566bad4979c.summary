having earned a reputation as one of football ’s most charmingly and free - thinking unique individuals , it came as something of a surprise on monday to hear @entity7 fall in to the tiresome trap of asking questions of the referee ’s impartiality ahead of tuesday 's last 16 clash with @entity13			1
asked by an @entity17 journalist if he had an issue with the fact that @entity21 referee @entity20 will be able to speak @entity22 to the @entity24 players at @entity25 on tuesday night , the @entity15 coach remarkably claimed that he had			1
' we hope it ’s not a concern , ' said @entity7			1
' he did two games already and did them well			2
i hope he continues to referee in the perfect way he has so far			1
' upset : @entity15 coach @entity7 is unhappy at the appointment of @entity20 for their @entity13 tie weary : @entity7 is concerned that @entity20 's native @entity22 language may sway decisions in @entity13 favour international pedigree : @entity20 has refereed two @entity40 matches so far including @entity41 vs @entity42 on the mic : @entity7 ( left ) was speaking at the @entity15 press conference ahead of tuesday 's game in @entity46 strong words : @entity7 added that he would give @entity20 's appointment the benefit of doubt @entity15 has chance to pull off upset focused : captain @entity53 is expected to start for the @entity15 team at the @entity25 on the ball : @entity53 will be hoping to fire the @entity17 's to the quarter - finals on tuesday working up a sweat : @entity58 ( centre ) and his @entity15 team - mates are put through their paces at training out of reach ? @entity17 are looking to go one better than at the @entity64 when they lost in the last 16 ' but is it a good feeling ? no , because @entity69 came from same group as @entity13 and he speaks @entity22 like their players			1
he will be able to speak to their players and not to us			2
' it is also the same country we beat in the last second at the last @entity40 , but it is what it is			2
' i know it ’s tricky for @entity84 to select the right referee for the right games			2
' we respect the decision and hope that everything goes well			0
we will give him the benefit of the doubt			0
' to suggest that there should be any doubt about @entity20 ’s partiality was a dubious tactic from @entity7			1
were he to say such a thing before game in the @entity101 , for example , the former @entity96 forward would be charged by the @entity102			0
here in @entity104 , though , it seems that anything goes and it was left to @entity13 coach @entity106 to defend the integrity of the referee and , to some extent , the competition			1
lying in wait : @entity17 could face @entity112 in the quarter - final providing @entity114 beat @entity115 @entity116 is huge - @entity7 bundle : @entity17 beat @entity69 at the 2010 @entity40 group stages courtesy of a late @entity121 winner here 's how @entity123 expects @entity13 and @entity17 to line - up against each other in tuesday 's last 16 clash			1
( name in yellow = one yellow card from ban ) ' i do n't think the referee is there to talk , he is there to referee , ' said @entity133			2
' three times we were in the last 16 and decisions did n't go our way			2
i think it 's finding excuses before the game			2
i looked at the @entity41 referee @entity141 and he disallowed the goal for the hosts @entity104			2
it 's up to the referee to make the right decision			1
' having advanced from a tough group containing his own country @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 , it is a shame that @entity7 has attempted to colour the build up to this game with such peculiar comments			1
apart perhaps from @entity42 , the @entity15 are the surprise package of this @entity40 and facing a @entity24 team that has n’t been convincing in the group stages and may be without injured @entity162 captain @entity161 , @entity7 ’s team has a sporting chance on tuesday evening			1
at home in the @entity17 , @entity7 believes support is growing			1
' advancing in the knock out stage means the world to me , ' he said			0
' you start a process , which i started a few years ago , and we see things developing on many fronts			0
unfazed : @entity13 coach @entity133 says @entity20 's appointment wo n't damage the last 16 tie 's integrity the last time @entity13 made it past the last 16 at a @entity40 they reached the semi-finals - that was at @entity182			1
there they were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity114 thanks to two goals from @entity186 ... and if they make it past the @entity15 they will face @entity114 in the quarters			1
' but you have benchmarks and you get judged by the @entity40			0
this is huge , it only comes along every four years			0
' you do n’t ’ want to wait four more years , you want to do it now			0
the sky is the limit			0
you want to clear one hurdle after another , but this is a big hurdle , make no mistake			0
' we made it through a difficult group , but we now want more , we are hungry			0
we have a lot of respect for @entity13 , but no fear at all			1
' the support back home means a lot to us			0
we get it communicated from back home			0
' the energy that comes from the @entity17 , with the thousands of fans in @entity104 , you can see where the game is going			0
you ca n’t stop it anymore , it ’s breaking through			0
hopes of a nation : @entity7 has been delighted at the support of the @entity15 national team at the @entity40 ' it is coming through at every level , there are kids playing it everywhere , but the recruiting office is the national team , in every country ' but when the game starts , you have to prove it and get the message through , ' the enthusiasm is incredible			1
our fans in @entity237 were the loudest , even though we lost to @entity151			0
' they will be here and the loudest again in @entity46			1
in @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 , we had packed crowds and a great send off			0
' it ’s a cool moment right now and we have to take advantage of it			0

@entity7 is unhappy at the appointment of @entity69 referee @entity20 for the @entity15 's last 16 clash against @entity13
@entity252 face @entity13 at @entity46 's @entity25 on tuesday
@entity20 's native @entity22 language is a concern for @entity7
