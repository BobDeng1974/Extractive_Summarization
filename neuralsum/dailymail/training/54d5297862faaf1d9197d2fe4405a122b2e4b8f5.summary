poor white americans are seeing their life expectancy decrease in trend that is close to what happened during the collapse of the @entity5			2
researchers have found that white women who did not finish high school saw the steepest decline and lost five years of their lives between 1990 and 2008			1
white men with a similar education died three years earlier than they should have over the same period			0
worrying : the life expectancy for poor white @entity0 has dropped dramatically worrying trend : chart shows how the life expectancy of whites without a high school degree has fallen in recent years @entity21 and @entity22 men and women , however , all saw their life expectancy rise			1
a similar study , presented by the @entity27 , found that the average life expectancy in @entity29 has risen from 29 years in 1900 to 74 years in 2010 , @entity25 reported			1
the researchers were appalled that in the @entity0 , the richest country in the world , people were living shorter lives and said the findings were ‘ deeply troubling ’			0
until now rising life expectancies have been a given in the developed world and that decreases only happened in war - torn @entity39 countries			0
but a combination of unhealthy lifestyles , obesity and prescription drug overdoses appear to be changing that			0
the research found that a lack of education was the key factor - white women who did not finish high school lived to 78.5 years in 1990 but just 73.5 years in 2008			1
by comparison white women who finished college lived for 83.9 years			1
men saw a drop from 70.5 to 67.5 years over the same period but when you factor in education , the gap was even bigger			2
school 's out : those who did not finish high school saw the steepest decline in life expectancy the researchers found that those who finished college lived for 80.4 years respectively - 13 years more than their less educated equivalents			1
lead researcher @entity66 , a public health professor at the @entity67 , said that such life expectancies were on a par with those seen in @entity29 in the 1950s and 60			0
and at the same time , black men and women - even if they had a poor education - saw their numbers steadily rise			0
@entity75 , head of the @entity76 of the @entity77 , said : ‘ we ’re used to looking at groups and complaining that their mortality rates have n’t improved fast enough , but to actually go backward is deeply troubling ’			0
the decline has caused @entity29 to shoot down the international league table of life expectancy , the @entity81 reported			1
unhealthy lifestyles : a rising number of obese people is partly to blame for the shift , researchers found according to the @entity92 ’s @entity91 , @entity29 women were 14th place in 1985 but were in 41st in 2012			1
among developed countries , @entity29 women were bottom			2
@entity95 , director of the @entity96 in @entity97 , said that a five year decline in life expectancy was like what happened in the @entity101 when it broke up			2
men lived seven years less on average than they did before due to rampant alcoholism , high levels of smoking and a healthcare system that had fallen apart			0
astonishing : a chart by the @entity110 shows the number of deaths per 100,000 people across the states in 2010 ( @entity116 not race - related )			0
