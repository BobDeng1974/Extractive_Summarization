by @entity0 published : 22:47 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 03:24 est , 13 november 2013 impassioned plea : prince @entity2 at the @entity3			1
he has written in @entity4 of the challenges facing farming communities prince @entity2 has issued an impassioned plea to save a @entity9 countryside which is ‘ as precious as any cathedral ’			1
in an editorial in @entity4 , written to mark his 65th birthday , the future king says the @entity9 countryside is the ‘ backbone ’ of our national identity			1
he also writes at length about the challenges facing farming communities , his frustration at estimates that 40 per cent of the food produced in the world goes to waste and even accuses supermarkets of exploiting small farmers			1
@entity2 says : ‘ i find it fascinating to watch how dramatically the landscape changes and how those changes affect the character of people , making the @entity9 countryside the unacknowledged backbone of our national identity			1
' it is as precious as any of our great cathedrals and we erode it at our peril			0
’ @entity2 , who becomes a pensioner tomorrow , agreed to guest edit the 116 - year - old magazine to mark the occasion			1
he uses his editorial to talk about the importance of rural communities and the fact that they are facing some of their ‘ toughest challenges ’ , with farmers often earning just £ 8,000 to £ 12,000 a year			1
he said : ‘ it concerns me greatly that the average age of a @entity9 farmer is currently 58 , and that a recent survey by the @entity53 suggested we will need 60,000 new farmers in the next decade			2
i fear it is a target we will not meet			0
‘ farming , of course , is much more than just a job			0
it is a way of life and most farmers accept that they will not earn as much as they would elsewhere			2
‘ this does not mean they should be penalised for choosing such a vital profession , and yet small farmers find themselves in the iniquitous position of taking the biggest risk , often acting as the buffer for the retailer and consumer against all the economic uncertainties of producing food , but receiving the least return			2
' it can not be right that a typical hill farmer earns just £ 12,600 , with some surviving on as little as £ 8,000 a year , while the big retailers and their shareholders do so much better out of the deal , having taken none of the risk			0
this has far - reaching consequences			0
‘ such is the squeeze on farm incomes that many small and medium - sized farms , and not just in the uplands , can not afford to make crucial long - term reinvestment , and i fear this will create huge problems in the near future , especially in the dairy sector			2
’ he added : ‘ farmers have taken a battering in recent years			1
’ @entity2 ’s suggestion that ‘ big retailers ’ are making money on the back of hard - pressed farmers will undoubtedly have resonance with many			1
indeed , it is not the first time that he has hit out at the ‘ bully ’ supermarkets for what he believes is the poor deal they give @entity9 farmers			2
special edition : the front cover of this week 's @entity4 features a picture of @entity2 taken at his @entity110 estate , while the frontispiece features a picture of his wife @entity114 the prince greets an @entity118 security officer during his tour : in an editorial written to mark his 65th birthday in @entity4 , the future king says the @entity9 countryside is the ' backbone ' of our national identity leading the way : @entity2 uses uses his editorial to talk about the importance of rural communities and the fact that they are facing some of their ' toughest challenges ' , with farmers often earning as little as £ 8,000 a year critics , however , are sure to point out the irony of his words after @entity2 handed over his then loss - making @entity139 food brand to national chain @entity140 in 2009			1
the firm has added dozens of new lines and remarketed the brand , although a significant proportion of the profits still goes to charity			0
the prince himself is also one of the largest landowners in the country through the @entity139 , which has 53,154 hectares of land in 24 counties , most in the south west of @entity153			2
prince @entity2 shares a light moment with conservationists @entity155 and @entity157 : he was said to be disappointed after the dozens of police officers accompanying him scared off the elephants in the area the prince also highlights what he sees as the huge levels of food waste that go on in the world , citing the @entity167 ’s @entity166 which estimates that roughly 40 per cent of food produced is thrown away			1
prince @entity2 yesterday unwisely chose to wear suede shoes for a trip to a rain - drenched jungle during his official tour of @entity118 with his wife			2
he was taken to see an ‘ elephant corridor ’ to learn more about work to save the dwindling @entity177 breed , but was left disappointed after the dozens of police officers accompanying him scared off everything but the local leeches			0
‘ on every other occasion in my life that i ’ve gone to these things it ’s the same - it ’s the security that ruins everything , ’ he said with undisguised irritation and mud - caked shoes			0
he describes @entity9 farmers as ‘ some of the best in the world ’ but warns that as a nation we ‘ can not go on taking as we do from the @entity192 without giving something back ’			0
the prince also highlights the loss of rare and ancient breeds of farm animals , dismissing critics who claim he simply has ‘ some sort of romantic attachment to a bygone age			0
’ ‘ my reasons are rooted in hard - nosed science and face the future			0
the preservation of these breeds and the characteristics in their genes could be crucial to our ability to farm sustainably , ’ he says			0
farmers and farming , he concludes , are the ‘ bedrock of our rural communities ’			1
‘ this is why the countryside ’s contribution to the national good has to be cherished and sustained			0
without it , we will all be very much the poorer , ’ he writes			0
@entity221 , editor of @entity4 , said of the piece : ‘ this essay reveals his unconditional passion for the @entity9 countryside and demonstrates a deep knowledge built up over many years			1
