in contrast , the survey found 85 per cent of 35 to 44 year olds would still get married in white			1
the research also explored the colours we associate with different events and emotions			0
it found that red is largely seen as the colour that represents love while yellow was the most popular choice to represent happiness			2

in contrast , more than a third of men said their favourite sports team had influenced their choice of favourite colour			0
pink princesses : @entity52 married @entity53 wearing a @entity55 gown that was hand - painted pink , @entity2 opted for a two - tone candy pink gown @entity57 , of @entity58 , who carried out the survey , said : ' it 's interesting that mums have had a great impact on their daughters			2
