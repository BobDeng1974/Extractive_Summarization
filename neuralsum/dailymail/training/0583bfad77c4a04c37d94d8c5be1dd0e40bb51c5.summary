' in order for the construction teams to build the platform without disrupting rail services , construction teams used a $ 7 million crane dubbed ' @entity50 ' to lay 16 separate 400 ton bridges , which were shunted together to form tunnels through which the trains continue to travel while construction goes on overhead			1
construction : the @entity19 development is the latest project by @entity59 , whose workers have spent the past two years hovering precariously above busy railway lines as they built the massive concrete platform changes : the area outside @entity3 has changed massively over the past two years			1
the office towers are scheduled to open for businesses to move in at some point in 2018 transformed : as can be seen in these before and after images , the tracks have been hidden from sight			2
