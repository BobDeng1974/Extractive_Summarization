@entity1 's agent has blasted @entity2 following @entity5 's @entity4 semi-final humiliation , calling him ' an old jerk ' and ' repulsive ' in a sarcastic @entity8 list			1
@entity9 produced a list of ' six requirements to be @entity13 coach ' and proceeded to belittle many achievements in @entity2 's managerial career			1
@entity1 missed the semi-final after fracturing the third vertebrae of his back in the last eight win over @entity20 , leading to an outpouring of national grief , and faces a race against time to be fit for the start of the season with @entity26			1
' ' two - going to @entity44 and being sacked the following day			0
' ' three - going to coach in @entity45			2
' four - returning to @entity5 , taking over a big team [ @entity46 ] and getting them relegated to the second division			0
' ' five - leaving the club 56 days before the end of the @entity51 [ season ] to ' escape ' the relegation			0
' six - being an old jerk , arrogant , repulsive , conceited and ridiculous			1
' blast : @entity1 's agent @entity9 published the six - point list criticising @entity2 on twitter end of the world : @entity2 leaves the field with a crying @entity60 following the heavy loss to @entity36 @entity62 ' six minutes of nightmares ' - @entity2 the fact @entity1 's agent is willing to make public such negative feelings about the @entity5 's coach sums up the mood in @entity5 that he should be sacked and replaced as soon as possible			1
@entity2 was defiant after tuesday 's 7 - 1 thrashing at the hands of @entity36 , saying although it was the worst moment of his career , he would not step down from the post			1
his last match , however , could be saturday 's third place play - off with @entity76 in @entity77			0
@entity2 's insistence that his squad were ' still developing ' and that most would be in the 2018 @entity4 is not borne out by the facts			2
out of the current @entity5 squad , only five the 23 players will be under 30 in 2018 , while 14 of the current @entity36 squad will still be in their 20s			2
fighting his corner : @entity2 came out and defended his record as @entity5 boss , adding that he still had a young squad @entity89 is viewed as @entity2 's most likely replacement , with @entity92 coach @entity91 and former @entity5 and @entity94 manager @entity93 also in the running			1
@entity2 has continued to insist his record was something to be proud of , telling a news conference on wednesday : ' it 's the first time we reached a semi-final since 2002 so maybe our work was n't so bad			1
in a year and a half together we played 28 games and won 19 , drew six and lost three			0
' in official games we won eight , drew two and lost this one - okay , catastrophically			0
but this episode is over now			0
' we have a commitment with the @entity108 ( @entity13 @entity109 ) until @entity110			2
