the troubled inquiry into historic child abuse is facing fresh criticism after it emerged that panel members were told what to say to mps by a long - serving @entity7 official			0
experts and abuse survivors were given a 23 - page document advising them how to answer ‘ difficult questions ’ when they appeared before a high - profile committee , prompting fears that the huge @entity15 - ordered investigation is not independent			1
it can also be revealed that the woman in charge of administration for the inquiry was seconded from the @entity7 , where she has worked for 36 years – even though the department is at the centre of many of the allegations of cover - ups and vip paedophile rings			0
police watchdog @entity26 ( left ) and academic @entity28 were emailed a 23 - page document outlining key kessages , key facts , and a chronology to use when they were quizzed by @entity34 mp @entity33 ( right ) last night critics said it was yet another blow to the reputation of the inquiry , which has barely begun work more than six months after it was announced			1
@entity39 and @entity40 both had to quit as chairman over conflicts of interest , with the replacement due to be announced this week			2
@entity33 , chairman of the @entity45 , told @entity46 : ‘ we are concerned that members of the secretariat , who have been seconded from the @entity7 , have told witnesses what to say			0
’ he led the questioning of police watchdog @entity26 and academic @entity28 when the panellists appeared before his committee last month to discuss the turmoil			1
@entity57 emails now reveal that the two witnesses had been given detailed ‘ key messages ’ , ‘ key facts ’ and a ‘ chronology ’ to learn , as well as instructions on ‘ difficult questions ’			1
it is just the latest blunder to hit the inquiry , after @entity40 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) were forced to resign as chairman over possible conflicts of interest the email was sent by @entity70 , ‘ head of secretariat ’ for the inquiry , who is effectively running its administration			1
she has been a @entity7 employee since october 1978 , a time when the department was allegedly giving funding to the @entity78			0
the late @entity79 was criticised for failing to outlaw @entity78 when he was home secretary in the 1980s and for not taking action on a dossier of alleged high - profile child abusers			0
responses given by panel members to the @entity45 on january 16 matched the answers suggested in advance by mrs @entity70 , including those on questions on whether the panel was going to be disbanded and who should chair the inquiry			2
a spokesman for the inquiry said : ‘ there was no coaching of panel members , but advice was legitimately given			0
