by @entity0 published : 22:57 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 22:59 est , 23 may 2013 health officials investigating a cluster of mysterious illnesses in @entity4 closed their investigation on thursday after determining the illnesses were unrelated and were caused by the same viruses that cause flu			1
the investigation involved 10 people who became sick and were admitted to hospitals in @entity12 and @entity13 in southeast @entity4			1
two died , six remained hospitalized thursday , and two had been released , state health officer @entity14 said			1
the 10 range in age from 24 to 87			0
a cluster of mysterious respiratory illnesses that alarmed southeast @entity4 turned out to be nothing more sinister than ordinary cold and seasonal flu @entity14 said health officials took extraordinary caution due to the emergence of two viruses , including the new @entity25 , in other countries			1
@entity4 is home to a military base and several aircraft plants that have frequent international travel ' we looked extremely hard			2
this represents the way the system is supposed to work , ' @entity14 said			0
testing at a state lab and at the @entity35 showed different groups of pathogens were present			2
four of the patients had a rhinovirus , the same family of germs that causes the common cold			0
three had bacterial - based pneumonia and others had influenza a and @entity47			0
all seven adults had been admitted to hospitals with symptoms including fever , cough and shortness of breath although it was not known whether the sufferers had gotten flu shots , the types of illnesses that were contracted were covered by this year 's vaccine			2
@entity14 said the flu pandemic of 2008 - 09 showed that flu cases are present in @entity4 throughout the year			1
it is uncommon , but not unheard of , for small outbreaks to occur in the spring and summer , he said			0
mysterious illnesses are always unnerving , but the cluster report came at a particularly sensitive time			0
health officials have been monitoring two deadly new illnesses that recently surfaced in different parts of the world - one a deadly form of bird flu that has appeared in @entity74 , the other a @entity76 - like coronavirus that seems to have originated in the @entity77			1
the bird flu has caused 131 illnesses and 32 deaths since the beginning of the year , according to the @entity82			2
the @entity76 - like virus ( called @entity84 ) has been identified as the cause of 44 illnesses , including 22 deaths , the @entity82 said			0
neither seems to be highly contagious so far , and neither illness has been reported in the @entity90			0
but in a world of daily international air travel , it 's always possible that a new germ of concern will hitchhike on an infected globetrotter and enter this country			0
the @entity35 tested the @entity4 patients for @entity84 , for different forms of flu and for more than a dozen other illnesses , the agency spokeswoman said			1
dr. @entity103 , head of infectious diseases for the state public health agency , said the precautions taken by @entity4 were worthwhile			1
she said using the same protocol , a pediatrician in north @entity4 last year observed a new @entity110 virus , a type of hand , foot and mouth disease in children			1
by identifying the new strain , the disease was able to be slowed and children treated in other states .			0

@entity4 state health officer : ' there is no evidence of any new or *unexpected* virus *circulating* '
people were worried the cases could be two bird deadly flu viruses , @entity127 and @entity128
