a stingray weighing nearly 800lb has become the largest freshwater fish ever caught by rod and line			1
the gigantic flat fish , which was 8ft wide and 14ft long , took nearly two hours to reel in			2
it was caught by @entity7 tv nature conservationist @entity6 on the @entity8 in @entity9 earlier this week			1
after getting the ray alongside the boat it was pulled into a specially - prepared pen where seven people lifted it out of the water so it could be properly measured			0
specialists measured its width , length and girth to calculate its weight			0
the epic catch will be featured on ' @entity33 ' , which will be broadcast on @entity34 in the @entity7 later this year			2
after the catch mr @entity6 tweeted : ' potential world record freshwater fish , giant stingray , 14ft @entity38 ! in @entity9 filming for @entity34 's @entity33			1
' he added : ' according to @entity43 , @entity40 and dr @entity41 , a leading stingray expert , this is likely to be the largest freshwater fish ever caught with a rod and reel			1
the gigantic flat fish , which was 8ft wide and 14ft long , had to be reeled in by several fishermen for nearly two hours it could not be placed on scales so specialists measured its width , length and girth to calculate its weight ' the battle to bring this giant fish to the boat was epic and it took many hours and multiple guys rotating off and on the reel			2
' the experience was a true highlight of the series , not only connecting with a record - sized ray but being a part of cutting edge science			0
' @entity66 , of @entity67 company @entity40 , whose fishing guides helped reel in the ray , said : ' we have caught over 450 different stingrays and our estimations have been proved highly accurate on the rare occasions we have weighed this species			0
a specially - prepared pen was used to contain the ray while mr @entity6 , fishermen and specialists examined it it is thought the previous record was held by @entity67 angler @entity82 , who landed a giant stingray weighing between 590lbs and 770lbs in the same river in 2009 ' the larger specimens are always female and quite often pregnant , as was the case with this capture			1
