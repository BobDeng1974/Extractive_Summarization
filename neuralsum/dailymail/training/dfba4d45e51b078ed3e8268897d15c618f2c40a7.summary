by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has confirmed @entity3 have lodged an appeal against captain @entity6 's yellow card that has seen him banned for the semi-final against @entity8			1
@entity6 picked up the caution against @entity10 , imposed after he blocked goalkeeper @entity11 taking a kick , and as it was his second of the tournament he was automatically suspended			0
' the @entity24 's chances of success appear limited - appeals against yellow cards are not usually permitted , only red cards			2
@entity39 appealed against midfielder @entity40 being suspended for the @entity42 final after he picked up a third booking in the semi-final , but @entity45 ruled that appeal was inadmissible			0
should @entity2 overturn the yellow card it would be hugely controversial and would allow other teams to claim that the governing body is favouring the hosts			1
all existing yellow cards are now wiped from the slate for the players from this stage of the tournament , however , meaning anyone who is booked in a semi-final will not risk suspension for the final unless they are sent off			2
@entity22 ready to fill @entity16 's boots			0

captain was booked during 2 - 1 *quarter* - final win over @entity10
@entity3 have appealed to @entity2 to have yellow card wiped out , *freeing* him for *tuesday* 's meeting with @entity8
