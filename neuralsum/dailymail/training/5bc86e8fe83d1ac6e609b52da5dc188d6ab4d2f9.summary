by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 01:50 est , 24 april 2013 students at the @entity3 college once attended by @entity4 provoked outrage last night over plans to hire a live shark as entertainment for a summer ball			1
the organising committee for students at @entity13 and @entity14 colleges planned to hire a live nursing shark to be displayed in a tank for their black - tie event on may 4th			1
but the plan has been met with condemnation from fellow students - with one accusing organisers of simply wanting to show that ‘ we have got so much money sloshing around we can hire a shark			1
’ with tickets costing a minimum of £ 110 the sell - out event was billed by organisers as a ‘ one night of decadence , debauchery and indulgence			1
’ some students planned to have a nurse shark glide around in a tank for the ' debauched ' summer ball but now a group of outraged former students have written to college principal dr @entity38 asking her to intercede and ‘ prevent any live animals from being used			1
’ one of the group , @entity41 , who graduated in 2011 , criticised the organisers ’ decision saying they were simply ‘ showing off			1
’ she said : ‘ we ’re primarily concerned about the shark			1
‘ we do n’t know where it came from in the first place , whether it was bred in captivity or captured in the wild , and we ca n’t find out as the committee wo n’t give us the details of the company they hired it from			0
‘ i am worried about the unnecessary stress for the animal of being transported and lots of people gawping at it			0
‘ this is about nothing more than showing off : “ we ’ve got so much money sloshing around we can hire a shark ”			1
’ @entity13 , at @entity3 , promised to throw a night of ' debauchery , decadence and indulgence ' history graduate @entity72 echoed her concerns , saying the event risked shaming the university and should be boycotted by students			1
he said : ‘ it ’s worrying that a leading educational institution such as an @entity3 college would allow that view of nature to be perpetuated , of animals as an extravagant , gaudy show			0
‘ if the organisers wo n’t cancel the shark then we wo n’t attend and we will ask others to boycott the event as well			1
’ the first signs of the stunt came earlier this year when organisers printed the @entity92 words for female shark ‘ @entity93 ’ on posters for the event			2
it was followed by the instruction : ‘ you should really go look that up			0
’ many students took it as a joke - but in february miss @entity41 e-mailed the chair of the ball committee @entity105 to check and was shocked to find that they were hiring a shark from a company which supplies animals to film studios			1
the second - year biology student told her that anyone objecting to the idea could have a refund but maintained the animal ’s welfare was not at risk			0
@entity14 college has incurred the wrath of students , who say the event risked shaming the university and should be boycotted yesterday he told the @entity123 that he cared ‘ a lot ’ for animal welfare and that the area around the tank could be quickly cleared during the event if it became distressed			1
he added that the idea of having a shark at the ball came from @entity132 ’s 1996 film @entity133 , in which the star - crossed teenagers meet while gazing through a fish tank			1
he said : ‘ as someone who cares a lot about animal welfare , i think we ’ve ensured this shark is looked after			2
‘ it will have a guard and caretaker with it at all times to look out for signs of stress , and we ’re keeping it there for only a short time			0
i feel confident that the shark will not suffer			2
’ in a statement the college said that staff were working with students to ensure ‘ the highest standards of safety and ethics			2
’ but such comments provoked fury from animal rights groups who claim there is no excuse for using live animals for entertainment purposes			2
@entity164 , director of animal rights group @entity165 slammed the plans branding them ‘ cruel ’ and ‘ idiotic			0
’ he said : ‘ @entity3 is supposed to attract the brightest and most intelligent of their generation but this clearly indicates that does not necessarily come with compassion and common sense			0
‘ this is clearly a cruel and pitiless thing to do			0
these are magnificent animals that belong in the sea			0
‘ you do n’t need to be a shark expert to know that this is not in the interest of the animal , she will be absolutely terrified by having a lot of morons playing loud music around her			2
‘ thankfully some of their fellow students have had the good sense to recognise that the organisers take note			0
‘ if they wish to be debauched and degenerate then let them do with respect to each other and not at the expense of innocent animals			0
the @entity197 said that it too was concerned about the conditions the shark would be held in			0
a spokesman for the charity said : ‘ using sharks in any type of event would require very careful planning to ensure their welfare , particularly in terms of transportation , housing and the potential impact of the event itself			0
