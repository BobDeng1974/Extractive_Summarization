by @entity0 the @entity1 is paying one of the @entity4 ’s former executives a six - figure sum to conduct a secret inquiry into its stars ’ earnings			2
@entity10 ’s firm @entity9 will investigate whether the @entity1 ’s top ‘ talent ’ – including @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 – is being overpaid			1
more than 250 @entity1 employees earn at least £ 250,000 a year and 14 earn more than £ 500,000 but the @entity1 refuses to name them			1
@entity12 ( left ) is believed to take home £ 2.6m - a - year making him the @entity1 's highest earner while @entity14 ( right ) earns £ 1m each year it is understood that @entity20 is the @entity1 ’s highest earner , on £ 2.6million a year , with @entity13 said to earn £ 2million a year , @entity14 £ 1million a year , @entity15 £ 500,000 and @entity21 £ 250,000 , leading to fears that ‘ talent ’ salaries are out of hand			1
the @entity1 says that it must pay such wages to keep up with commercial rivals			0
yet despite going to the expense of hiring mr @entity10 ’s agency , the @entity1 has already said some details from the report , such as ‘ individual talent deals ’ , will remain secret , preventing licence fee - payers from knowing how much the @entity1 pays its stars and how these compare to those in the commercial sector			2
a review is being launched to find out if the @entity1 's top ' talent ' is being paid too much money girls ' big payday : @entity15 is thought to collect £ 500,000 while @entity42 star @entity21 gets £ 250,000 , the @entity1 maintains the study ‘ will compare the size and structure of the @entity1 ’s reward packages with those offered by other broadcasters ’			1
but this has triggered doubts about the ethics of employing a third party to find out what commercial rivals pay when the @entity1 will not reveal what its own publicly funded employees earn			1
last night @entity57 mp @entity56 said : ‘ this does n’t seem a reasonable use of licence - fee money			0
’ this is the second time the firm run by mr @entity10 – who was the @entity1 ’s head of strategy from 1989 to 1995 – has carried out a review of stars ’ pay for the @entity1			2

@entity13 is the @entity1 's second highest earner taking home a cool £ 2m - a - year a freedom of information request submitted by @entity74 to the @entity1 has revealed that five ‘ key staff ’ from @entity10 & @entity76 will work on the project , the findings of which are expected to be published at the end of the year			1
in addition , an unspecified number of other employees of the firm , based in @entity82 , west @entity83 , will assist			0
the @entity1 has refused to say how much it is spending on the review , but an industry insider said this weekend that it is ‘ easily more than £ 100,000 ’ , given the number of staff involved and its scope			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ the intention of this review is to ensure that licence fee - payers are getting a good deal on talent			0
it has never been our intention that the @entity1 or the @entity97 will have access to raw pay data of other broadcasters , and no details of individual talent deals for either the @entity1 or other broadcasters will be published			0

more than 250 @entity1 employees earn at least £ 250,000 a year and 14 earn more than £ 500,000 but the @entity1 refuses to name them
