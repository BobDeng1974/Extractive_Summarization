by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:57 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 15:24 est , 4 november 2013 the number of @entity4 who believe that @entity7 ’s assassination was the result of a government conspiracy has dropped over the past ten years reveals a new poll			1
according to an @entity0 - @entity12 poll , conducted in april , 59 percent of @entity4 think multiple people were involved in a conspiracy to kill the president , while 24 percent think @entity16 acted alone , and 16 percent are unsure			1
while a clear majority still suspect there was a conspiracy behind the tragic death of president @entity22 , the number is down from the 75 percent who felt there was a conspiracy in a 2003 @entity27 poll			2
the number of people who believe that the shooting of @entity7 was due to a conspiracy has dropped 16 percent in the past ten years as the 50th anniversary of @entity22 's death approaches , the number of @entity4 who believe @entity16 acted alone is at its highest since the period three years after the nov. 22 , 1963 , assassination , when 36 percent said one man was responsible			1
president @entity37 appointed the @entity38 on nov. 29 , 1963 , to investigate both @entity22 's assassination and the killing of @entity16 days later			2
the commission concluded that @entity16 was the lone gunman			2
those who were adults in 1963 were almost as likely as younger @entity4 to say that @entity22 's killing was a conspiracy involving multiple people - 55 percent , compared to 61 percent			1
the poll was conducted april 11 - 15 , 2013 and involved landline and cellphone interviews with 1,004 adults nationwide			0
there has been a 16 per cent drop over the past ten years in the number of people who believe in conspiracy theories surrounding @entity7 's assassination the number of @entity4 who believe @entity16 acted alone is at its highest since the period three years after the nov. 22 , 1963 , assassination five decades after president @entity22 was fatally shot and long after official inquiries ended , thousands of pages of investigative documents remain withheld from public view			1
the contents of these files are partially known - and intriguing - and conspiracy buffs are not the only ones seeking to open them for a closer look			0
some serious researchers believe the off - limits files could shed valuable new light on nagging mysteries of the assassination - including what @entity4 intelligence agencies knew about accused assassin @entity16 before nov. 22 , 1963			1
it turns out that several hundred of the still - classified pages concern a deceased @entity75 agent , @entity74 , whose activities just before the assassination and , fascinatingly , during a government investigation years later , have tantalized researchers for years			2
‘ this is not about conspiracy , this is about transparency , ’ said @entity80 , a former @entity81 reporter and author embroiled in a decade - long lawsuit against the @entity75 , seeking release of the closed documents			2
‘ i think the @entity75 should obey the law			0
i do n't think most people think that 's a crazy idea			0
’ the poll found that those who were adults in 1963 were almost as likely as younger @entity4 to say that @entity22 's killing was a conspiracy involving multiple people - 55 percent , compared to 61 percent an undated passport photo of @entity75 agent @entity74 : several hundred of the still - classified pages concern the now deceased agent @entity80 's effort has been joined by others , including @entity103 , chief counsel for a @entity105 investigation into the @entity7 assassination in the 1970s			1
but so far , the @entity74 files and thousands more pages primarily from the @entity75 remain off - limits at a @entity111 center in @entity112 , @entity113 others say the continued sealing of 50 - year - old documents raises needless questions in the public 's mind and encourages conspiracy theories			1
‘ there is no question that in various ways the @entity75 obfuscated , but it may be they were covering up operations that were justifiable , benign @entity75 operations that had absolutely nothing to do with the @entity22 assassination , ’ said @entity121 , a @entity122 author who has written extensively about the @entity7 case			0
‘ but after 50 years , there is no reason that i can think of why such operations should still be concealed , ’ @entity121 said			0
‘ by withholding @entity74 material , the agency continues to encourage the public to believe they 're covering up something more sinister			0
