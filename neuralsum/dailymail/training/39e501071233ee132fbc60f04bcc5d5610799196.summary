by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:57 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:43 est , 20 december 2013 for more than 100 years the dome of the @entity5 building in @entity6 has stood as a proud marker for @entity9 democracy and success			1
but now it is due to be covered over with scaffolding as the first repairs to it since 1960 begin to fix the 1,300 cracks in its cast iron shell			1
and , unlike some of the politicians below , the builders above will have to work fast as the $ 60million construction project is scheduled for completion just before the next presidential inauguration on january 20 , 2016			1
now is the time to intervene and make sure it 's preserved for generations to come			0
' the hugely complicated project will involve removing several floral displays and pillars to be taken away for repair , while the 290ft high dome will be patched and made watertight			2
workmen will have to remove up to 13 layers of lead - based white paint in order to get to the 14.1million pound iron structure below which has been damaged by centuries of rain and roosting birds			1
paint job : workmen will have to chip away up to 13 layers of lead - based paint before they are able to get at some of the damaged cast iron underneath crumbling : the cornerstone of the old building was laid in 1793 by @entity48 himself during a day of celebrations in the @entity9 capital rusted : work was finished in 1826 thanks to the work of five architects , but more building began in 1850 as congress expanded along with the nation in fact birds are the reason the condition of the dome began being monitored again after water leaked through a hole made by a nesting bird and on to the rotunda floor during a storm			1
modern building techniques will hopefully ensure that the current restoration survives longer than the last effort , as mr @entity108 revealed that welding completed between 1959 and 1960 has already failed			0
the cornerstone of the building was laid in 1793 by @entity48 himself with great pomp and ceremony , and was then worked on by doctor and part - time architect @entity114 who placed a shallow dome between the @entity117 wing and the @entity119 wing			2
conflict : much of the early work on the @entity5 was destroyed when @entity123 troops set fire to it in 1814 after hours : work to repair the 14.1million pound dome will take place mainly at night so as not to disturb congress who will carry on working below faulty : @entity108 , @entity54 , says that welding that took place during the last restoration has already failed and will need to be fixed construction then crawled along under the watchful eye of several different architects before much of their work was undone by @entity123 soldiers in 1814 who set fire to both the @entity5 building and the @entity142			1
fortunately a rain storm stopped the building from being completely destroyed and construction was eventually ' finished ' in 1826			0
while scaffolding will cover some of the outside of the dome during the repairs , the fresco apotheosis of @entity48 will stay on display as a doughnut - shaped safety net will be set up around it			1
as it was : while the early @entity5 featured a dome , it was a shallow structure between the two wings and nowhere near as grand as the one that stands today expanding : architect @entity160 was tasked with expanding the building in 1850 as the growth of the nation was reflected with a growth in congressmen and senators crowning glory : the cast iron dome was added during the construction which included an expansion of the grounds around the building the whole site will be illuminated with bight lights as most of the work will be carried out at night so as not to disrupt the work of congress			1
however building work continued to enlarge the @entity5 from 1850 and it was architect @entity160 who designed the cast iron dome to sit between new enlarged chambers , with work finishing in 1868			1
the massive fresco inside the dome was painted by @entity51 artist @entity50 and consists of a portrait of the nation ’s first president rising to the heavens flanked by the allegorical figures of @entity191 / @entity190 and @entity192			2
high point : at its tallest point the dome stands at 290ft with the whole of @entity6 visible below it including the @entity48 monument historical : construction work on the building started in 1793 but was halted in 1814 when @entity123 troops set fire to it along with the @entity142 tight schedule : work is due to finish just before the next presidential inauguration which will take place on january 20 2016 off limits : while the dome itself will be obscured from view during the work , the main fresco will remain visible thanks to doughnut shaped scffolding they are surrounded by maidens representing the first thirteen colonies and around the perimeter , on the ground below , six groups of figures depict @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , and @entity229			1
maintenance of the modern - day @entity5 falls to the @entity54 who is appointed for a ten - year term by the president and approved by the senate			2
the architect is responsible for the maintenance of all all of the congressional office buildings , the @entity240 buildings , the @entity241 , the @entity242 , and the @entity243			0
work on the @entity5 began in 1793 as the cornerstone was laid by @entity48 as part of a day of celebrations			2
a string of architects then took up the job of completing it , including @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 who completed the @entity117 wing in 1800			0
@entity256 was hired in 1803 nd by 1811 he had renovated the @entity117 wing and completed the @entity119 wing			0
however much of their work was wasted in 1814 when @entity123 troops set fire to the building , along with the @entity142 , which were only saved by a rain storm			0
eventually building work was ' finished ' in 1826 by @entity265 , but as the nation and the government expanded it became necessary , in 1850 , to start extending the structure			0
it was during this period of building , from 1850 to 1868 that @entity160 added the large cast iron dome that sits on top of the building today			1
he also extended both the @entity276 wings , adding new legislative chambers and expanding the grounds			0
in 1897 the @entity240 moved out of the @entity5 into its own building , making space for new committee rooms			2
in the 20th century , separate buildings were constructed to provide offices and committee rooms for the @entity119 and @entity117			0
the @entity284 moved into its own building in 1935			0
today ’s @entity5 complex includes the @entity5 , six major @entity119 and @entity117 buildings , three @entity240 buildings , the @entity241 , the @entity242 , and other facilities			2
the latest new project was to add the visitor centre to accommodate some of the millions of people who come to see the @entity5 every year , and it took from 2001 until 2008 for it to be completed			1
the last restoration efforts happened between 1959 and 1960 and the latest work is expected to take to years , finishing just before the 2016 @entity296 inauguration			0
the building and its grounds are maintained by an architect who is appointed by the president and approved by the senate for a 10 - year term .			0
