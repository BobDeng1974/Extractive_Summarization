by @entity0 it seemed that life could n't get any better for @entity3 and @entity4			1
the @entity6 couple , 22 and 26 , was just a few weeks away from their wedding as they wrapped up a summer of leading @entity11 youth in outdoors trips near the @entity14 foothills outside of @entity15			1
out in nature , hiking and rock - climbing , they were happy			2
' i 've just spent two awesome days with my fiancee @entity21 , ' wrote @entity4 , 26 , in a visitor log at a wooden hutch near the coastal hamlet of @entity25 , @entity26			1
' can life ever be so perfect ? ' the two were on an impromptu getaway from camp when @entity4 wrote that note			1
later that night , they had trouble finding a place to stay , so they packed their camping gear and headed to a deserted beach , where they fell asleep for the night			1
it was aug. 15 , 2004			2
murdered : @entity3 , 22 , and @entity4 , 26 , were camp counselors when they were killed 10 years ago			1
they were to be married weeks after they were shot while camping at an abandoned beach in @entity26 still seeking answers : the families of the victims , @entity45 and @entity46 and @entity47 and @entity48 ( left to right ) , routinely visit the spot where @entity21 and @entity4 were killed , hoping to understand the senseless tragedy the two would be found three days later , still inside their sleeping bags , shot in the head at close range by a .45 - caliber @entity56 rifle			1
' there 's not a day that goes by that she has n't come into my mind and my heart and oftentimes my prayers , ' @entity3 's father , @entity57 , told the @entity65			1
' and yes , there are still times that i shake my head a little bit			2
it was all so surreal			2
' it has been 10 years since the senseless tragedy , and the families continue to seek answers about the double murder			1
' did they run into somebody who does n't like @entity11 ? they freely talked about their love for the @entity78 , ' @entity4 's dad , @entity45 , told the @entity65			2
' or was there someone down on the beach who was planning something illegal and they just happened to wander upon it ? i do n't know			2
lots of things it could be			2
' detectives at the @entity91 say the investigation remains very much active			0
' there have been several times in the investigation where our adrenaline got going and we thought we had something good , ' lt. @entity93 told the @entity65			0
' it turned out it was n't as good as we thought			0
' @entity4 and @entity21 smile as they celebrated their wedding shower in may 2004 one of those times came a few years back , when investigators thought that fugitive @entity105 , who was a suspect of killing two campers in @entity107 , could have something to do with the @entity25 killing			1
but then he died in a 2009 shootout in @entity111 , and dna evidence later exonerated him from the crime			0
there was also drifter from @entity116 , who was a prime suspect right after the bodies were found			0
he , too , was ruled out shortly afterward			0
' i think about this case all the time , ' @entity93 told the @entity65			0
' my wife still talks to me about this case			0
she 'll ask , ' hey , what 's going on in @entity124 ? did you ever think of this ? '' crime scene : detectives with the @entity91 investigate the beach where @entity4 and @entity21 were murdered heartbroken : the parents of the victims talk to reporters near the spot where @entity4 and @entity21 were killed ' not to say you do n't want to do that for the rest of the cases , ' he added			1
' but in this case , if ever there was an innocent victim , here you have them			0
' friends and family of the couple last week traveled from all over the country to visit the spot where @entity21 and @entity4 lost their lives			1
a bouquet of flowers was placed at the spot where they camped			0
' more than anything i just really miss them , " @entity152 told the @entity65			0
' there 's this homesickness that 's deep in your heart and does n't go away			0
we fall out of our chair crying sometimes â€” every holiday , every birthday			0
on my way home from work i just heard a song and i started crying			0
' oars with various biblical passages written on them are shown leaning against whitewater rafts at @entity171 , a @entity11 outdoor adventure camp where @entity4 and @entity21 were leaders			1
