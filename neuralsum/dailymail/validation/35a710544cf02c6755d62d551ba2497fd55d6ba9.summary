it looks like something from outer space , but the ' alien of the deep ' is found much closer to home			0
with its fleshy snout , nail - like teeth and flabby pink body it would n't look out of place in a science fiction film , but the rare sea goblin shark described as an ' alien of the deep ' has been found off @entity15 's southeast coast and delivered to the @entity16 in @entity17			1
the prehistoric - looking goblin sharks live on deep sea bottoms and little is known about their lives			1
the shark had died by the time it was handed over , but it was still a priceless asset as only four of them have been acquired by the @entity17 museum - the first two collected back in the 1980s			1
a goblin shark with a long flattened snout covered with pores is shown at the @entity16 ' it 's pretty impressive , it 's not hideous it 's beautiful , ' said the @entity16 's fish collection manager @entity32 , who described its teeth as looking like ' little daggers '			1
' they are not caught terribly often			0
they are not encountered terribly often at all			0
' the latest was picked up by a fisherman in january			0
it was found near @entity40 , off @entity15 's southeast coast , at a depth of about 200 metres and delivered in excellent condition to the museum			2
the @entity16 's fish collection manager @entity32 shows the jaws of a @entity47 in the sorting lab in @entity17 @entity32 said he was ' thrilled ' to handle the shark , which is found in the @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity54 oceans			1
the species , whose scientific name is ' mitsukurina owstoni ' , is thought to be a living fossil dating back some 125 million years			0
the animal 's jaw mechanism , which shoots forward when it detects prey and then retracts under its fleshy , spade - shaped snout , was what fascinated @entity32 the most			2
its fleshy snout , nail - like teeth and flabby pink body makes it stand out from the crowd ' i suspect because it has got soft , flabby musculature , it does n't need much energy ... so it will swim slowly over the bottom just using its snout like a metal detector , ' he said			2
' it will be sweeping over the bottom and when it detects a small fish , or a crab or a squid it will shoot those jaws out ' wham ' and capture whatever it is			0
' it will spear it with those sharp pointed teeth and then just wolf it down whole			0
' the @entity16 shows off a goblin shark , a rare sea creature described as an ' alien of the deep ' the latest goblin shark specimen , from which tissue samples have been taken for genetic testing , will be preserved by the museum and made available for research .			1
