' radicalised ' : @entity0 , 15 , who is believed to have travelled to @entity1 after talking online with young @entity3 women already in the country the 15 - year - old girl from @entity6 believed to have travelled to @entity1 to marry an @entity8 militant may have been recruited by @entity3 women already in the country			1
police believe @entity0 from @entity6 was communicating online with a @entity3 woman in @entity1 just weeks before she and a 17 - year - old friend from @entity13 left the @entity3			1
one message posted online said : ' i yearn to be the wife of a mujahid and support him and khilafa ( the @entity20 caliphate ) all the way			2
' as many as 70 women and girls are among the hundreds of @entity24 thought to have travelled to fight alongside @entity8 in @entity1			1
some , the @entity25 reports , have joined an all - female religious police unit in @entity27 , the de facto capital of @entity29 's self - declared caliphate , called the @entity31 brigade			1
this unit enforces a strict interpretation of religious morality on local women , dishing out beatings to those caught breaking the @entity20 dress code , smoking , or otherwise transgressing the law			0
one member , with the alias ' @entity41 ' , uses @entity44 , the social networking and blogging site , to communicate with @entity24 thinking of travelling to @entity1			1
the @entity25 claims that she is an 18 - year - old from @entity13 of @entity48 heritage , although she denies being @entity3 in a post on her @entity44 blog			0
among posts advising on whether it is possible to get hair straighteners in the caliphate and what kind of smartphone apps will be useful , she advised what the @entity25 says is a 15 - year - old from @entity3			0
the anonymous questioner asked : ' i so badly want to go to raqqah and live under the shariah and live in the land of khilafa but as a young muslimah in the uk it 's rly difficult and my family would be completely against it			2
' i want to escape the fitna of the kuffar land please make dua @entity72 allows me to make hijra to the lands of @entity75 , it hurts my heart to live here			0
' i yearn to be the wife of a mujahid and support him and khilafa all the way			0
' @entity41 told her : ' it is a beautiful feeling being married to a mujahid ... my advice to you is hasten , because i ’ve seen people who wanted to make hijrah for so long and delayed it ( for no legit reason ) untill [ sic ] the punishment of @entity72 came upon them and they remained in @entity91 [ land of the unbelievers ]			2
' @entity94 women : this picture , taken from the @entity98 account of a woman who has travelled to join @entity8 , is understood to show @entity100 alongside two friends , @entity102 and @entity103 detectives at the @entity105 were examining the exchanges , according to the @entity25			2
@entity0 15 - year - old has not been seen since she left her family home in @entity110 , @entity6 , for school on september 24			2
police believe she took a coach from @entity6 to @entity114 , where she met a 17 - year - old girl from @entity116 , @entity13			0
the pair then flew to @entity118 , @entity119 , before presumably heading for the @entity1 border			2
last week @entity0 's mother , @entity121 , made a desperate appeal for the schoolgirl to return home , as hopes of finding her before she crossed the border appeared to fade			1
she wept as she begged the schoolgirl to return to @entity3 in an emotional press conference			0
' @entity0 , i am your mum , i love you , ' mrs @entity0 , supported by @entity0 's aunts @entity131 and @entity132 , said			1
' please , please , please , we miss you , come back			0
' i love you so much			0
all your brothers and your sister miss you so , so much			0
the house is not the same			0
' @entity100 's @entity44 blog : she gave advice to a 15 - year - old girl on whether to travel to @entity1 against her parents wishes			1
it seems likely this was @entity0 , who disappeared a little over a month after the messages ' please , please , please , we miss you , come back ' : @entity0 's mother @entity121 weeps at a press conference family friends previously said they believed @entity0 , who wears a hijab as part of her faith , had become radicalised on chat rooms and forums online			1
it is not yet clear how she met the 17 - year - old			0
but @entity0 's parents have stressed that nothing has been proven about their daughter 's beliefs			1
in a statement her mother and father @entity161 said : ' there have been many assumptions and speculations claiming that @entity0 is travelling to @entity1 , that she maybe an extremist , or that she is planning to become a jihadist bride all of which have not as of yet been proved with any concrete evidence			1
' the family also echoed calls for action over the role of border officials in preventing children from flying abroad without their parents			0
the girls ' disappearance follows that of @entity180 and @entity181 , 16 , from @entity182 , who are thought to have travelled to @entity1 in july			1
more than 500 @entity3 extremists are thought to have travelled to the war torn country , around half of whom are said to be from @entity13 .			2

@entity189 thought to have been talking online with brits already in @entity1
one , @entity100 , *regularly* dishes out advice on travelling to the country
police said to be looking into how she is linked to @entity0 's disappearance
