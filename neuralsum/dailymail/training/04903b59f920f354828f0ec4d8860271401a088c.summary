mr @entity152 said : ' child sexual exploitation is not a crime that is committed by one ethnic minority group			0
' we have done some analysis locally and nationally and it 's fair to say the biggest offending group when it comes to child sexual exploitation is white males			0
' however with the high profile cases that there have been nationally , there also does appear to be a worrying trend in relation to the number of cases involving @entity176 males and that needs to be addressed			0
' we should n't be afraid to say that			0
' all communities , i am hoping , will come together to recognise this is a problem			0
' it is all our jobs , as adults , to protect children			2

the force was determined to learn the lesson of other child sexual exploitation cases around the country where victims were not initially believed			0
mr @entity152 said : ' in other areas the victims have come forward and have told people about their experiences and apparently they have not been listened to			0
' in this case , after the first contact , we have gone looking and have encouraged victims and tried to support them , and have identified more suspects			0
' ' i hope the verdicts send out a clear message to anyone involved in this type of abuse and exploitation that we will catch up with you and you will potentially be looking at going to prison			0
' grooming affects girls from all walks of life and different social backgrounds			2
' i would urge parents to ensure they know who their children are talking to on social networking sites , where their children are , who they are going out with , how they are getting there and what means they have to pay for their journey and evening			1
