if there were any doubts that former @entity4 gov. @entity3 wants back into the public spotlight , an opinion essay published thursday afternoon castigating president @entity6 for shrinking @entity8 's military footprint should dispel them			1
the @entity11 's 2012 presidential candidate opened up with both barrels on the @entity13 , warning that ' bullying , invasion and regional wars ' will ultimately become the norm if the @entity8 withdraws from its historical role as the sole superpower capable of knitting together the world 's fragile detente			1
' the most ludicrous excuse for shrinking our military derives from the president ’s thinking , he charged : " things are much less dangerous now than they were 20 years ago , 25 years ago or 30 years ago "			0
' ' the " safer world " trial balloon has been punctured by recent events in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			0
' @entity6 told an audience of @entity63 donors in july that he believes @entity8 are concerned by ' the sense that around the world , the old order is n't holding , and we ’re not quite yet to where we need to be in terms of a new order that 's based on a different set of principles , that 's based on a sense of common humanity , that ’s based on economies that work for all people			1
' that , @entity3 claimed in the @entity78 , is dangerous hogwash stemming from the belief that ' [ t ] he old order ... where @entity8 ’s disproportionate strength holds tyrants in check and preserves the sovereignty of nations , is to be replaced			1
' and putting ' common humanity ' on a pedestal , he wrote in a thinly veiled reference to the @entity91 turmoil pitting the self - proclaimed @entity39 and @entity92 ( @entity93 ) against the @entity94 , ' ignores the reality that humanity is far from common in values and views			1
' ' @entity99 may commonly agree that there is evil , but what one people calls evil another calls good , ' @entity3 warned			1
@entity6 and his spokespersons have framed @entity93 and other global threats as a challenge to be marginalized through the collective work of aligned nations with no one at the forefront			2
his oft - mocked foreign - affairs principle of ' leading from behind ' is the most commonly cited summary of the idea			2
but if a ' multipolar world ' were to replace ' one led by a strong @entity8 , ' @entity3 wrote , the other alpha dogs would n't necessarily be friendly nations			1
' with emerging poles being @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 , the world would not see peace , ' he predicted ; ' it would see bullying , invasion and regional wars			1
and ultimately , one would seek to conquer the others , unleashing world war			0
' the @entity91 turmoil unleashed simultaneously by an aspiring nuclear @entity122 and a mass - murderous @entity93 – coupled with a @entity121 invasion of @entity31 – drew a dramatic crescendo from @entity3 , with rhetoric that sounded more like a campaign speech than a thought piece			1
the @entity8 , he wrote , would never be left alone if it walked away			1
' the history of the 20th century teaches that power - hungry tyrants ultimately feast on the appeasers , ' according to @entity3			1
' we would be paying the cannibals to eat us last			0
' he attributed that phrase to former @entity143 gov. @entity142 , who also once chaired the @entity144			0
the coinage , however , dates back to @entity146			0
do - over : rep. @entity148 , who ran as @entity3 's vice presidential nominee in 2012 , has said he hopes the former @entity4 governor takes another shot at winning the @entity13 @entity6 spent thursday at a @entity153 conference in @entity154 , building bridges to a ' multipolar ' approach to global conflict that @entity3 says would be a disastrous replacement for @entity8 supremacy @entity3 used the same line in a december 2011 @entity162 interview , lambasting @entity120 for flooding global markets with cheap goods at the same time it devalued its currency			1
' right now , they 're discounting their products on a very dramatic basis , and in doing so , closing down @entity8 businesses , killing @entity8 jobs , ' he told host @entity172 during the peak of the presidential primary season			2
' and we can say , " oh , it 's great , we 're getting these products cheap			0
" it 's little like saying we 're paying the cannibal to eat us last			0
it does n't make sense			0
' ' that 's paraphrasing @entity146 , by the way , ' @entity3 added then			2
' his line , not mine			0
' @entity3 's recent reappearances on political talk shows and bloggers ' front - burners comes at a time when @entity6 is being pilloried for failing to take action against @entity93 ; playing a tone - deaf round of golf after the first of two @entity8 were beheaded on video in @entity38 ; and arguing that international coalition - building , not @entity8 military firepower , has the best chance of restoring order in the @entity202 world			1
if the former governor is planning to run for president again in 2016 , his timing could n't be better			0
one @entity207 poll from @entity208 and @entity209 found that if the 2012 election were held again , @entity3 would beat @entity6 handily , by a 53 - 44 margin			1
buoyed by the changing political winds , he said two weeks ago during a @entity214 political rally that the @entity6 presidency has been ' a good deal worse than even i expected			2
' last week another poll found he would crush the @entity11 competition in a hypothetical matchup in @entity221 , the hyper - important early caucus state			2
days later , he told a conservative television host that while he does n't plan to run again , ' circumstances can change			0
' but he would still lose in a national election against @entity226 – by 13 points – according to the @entity208 / @entity209 poll			0
horror : when @entity8 photojournalist @entity229 was executed by an @entity230 on video , an aloof @entity6 drew jeers by rushing to play a round of golf as soon as he finished delivering a public condemnation more hawkish than thou : @entity3 must stake out political territory more aggressive than @entity226 's if he wants to run again , and she has swung decidedly to the right since leaving the @entity6 @entity239 @entity240 , the former secretary of state has made her own headlines in the last month by courting friction with the @entity6 @entity13 over foreign policy issues during a wide - ranging interview in the @entity245			1
@entity6 's ' failure ' to arm @entity38 's rebels , she said , ' left a big vacuum , which the [ @entity93 ] jihadists have now filled			2
' ' there is no such thing ' as @entity122 's ' right ' to enrich uranium , @entity240 insisted			2
and @entity261 ' did what it had to do to respond to the rockets ' lobbed in its direction by the @entity260 terror network , she added			0
' @entity261 has a right to defend itself			0
' faced with an increasingly hawkish @entity226 , @entity3 staked out his own political turf on thursday in case he needs it two years from now			1
and in the same breath , he managed to paint mrs. @entity226 with the same broad brush he wielded to tar the @entity63			1
@entity6 and liberal voters , @entity3 wrote , have become so enamored with domestic spending that they 're willing to sacrifice national security to sustain it			1
' politicians , and many of the people who elect them , want to keep up spending here at home , ' he claimed			0
' entitlements and programs are putting pressure on the federal budget : we either cut defense , or we cut spending on ourselves			0
that , or raise our taxes			0
to date , the politicians have predictably voted to slash defense			0
' current and future @entity8 leaders , he concluded , will have to ' choose whether to succumb to the easy path of continued military hollowing or to honor their constitutional pledge to protect the @entity8			2

@entity11 's 2012 presidential also - ran wrote in the @entity78 that the @entity13 is setting the @entity8 up for chaos by hollowing out armed forces
he staked out hawkish political territory as @entity63 presidential front - runner @entity226 is doing the same
he warned against replacing @entity8 supremacy with a ' multipolar world ' dominated by @entity120 , @entity121 and a nuclear @entity122
@entity3 mocked @entity6 for *relying* on world 's ' common humanity ' to prevent wars
