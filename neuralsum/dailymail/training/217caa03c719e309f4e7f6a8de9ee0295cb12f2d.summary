@entity12 said during the struggle he was breathing heavily and was attempting to activate his wife 's buoyancy control vest			1
' in the back of my mind i was thinking these people could see us , or at least think something was odd going on , ' @entity12 told detectives			2
' i pretty much lost it , ' @entity12 told @entity58 detectives			2
as the court listened to his voice , defence lawyer @entity59 handed @entity12 a box of tissues and patted him on the shoulder			0
@entity12 and @entity12 married in their home state of @entity44 just 11 days before her death			1
they were in @entity4 on their honeymoon and were on the first day of a week long diving trip off the coast of @entity21 when she died			0
@entity12 told police ' five to seven minutes ' into their dive over the @entity77 shipwreck they struggled against a strong current			2
he said @entity12 got into difficulty and at one point banged his mask and air regulator			0
he said he thought he kicked his wife with his fin to get some space from her and she floated away from him			0
preparing : @entity11 , right , talks with his attorney @entity88 at the @entity89 in @entity43 , @entity44 , on monday			2
he is accused of killing newly - wed bride @entity12 in court : @entity11 , with wife @entity25 , wait in the courtroom for jury selection to begin at the trial on monday ' she was out of arm 's reach , ' @entity12 said in the police interview			1
jewellery : this was the ring being worn by @entity11 's new wife @entity25 outside court on monday @entity12 said he swam down to get her , but decided against chasing her to the seabed and instead headed for the surface			1
' i remember shouting through my regulator ' @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 ' , ' @entity12 told police			1
the jury of eight women and six men also looked at a haunting underwater photo taken by another diver of the death scene			0
it showed @entity107 sprawled in deep water as @entity12 swam to the surface			2
prosecutors appeared to attempt to cast doubt on @entity12 's version of what happened			2
they believe @entity12 turned off his wife 's air supply while both were underwater and held her in a bear - hug until she lost consciousness - before turning the air back on and letting her sink			1
they elicited testimony that @entity11 , now 34 , was certified as an open water scuba diver , an advanced diver , rescue diver and specialty diver			2
earlier yesterday , @entity58 detective senior constable @entity138 , who conducted two taped interviews with @entity12 , testified from the witness box			0
married again : @entity11 , along with his new wife @entity25 , prepares to enter the @entity89 in @entity43 , @entity44 , on monday , ahead of jury selection for his trial was it murder ? @entity11 says his wife @entity12 died as the result of a terrible diving accident on the day @entity12 died , the detective said @entity12 became agitated when told police could not give him back his dive computer			1
the dive computer , which looks like a large watch , tracks a swimmer 's dive			1
' at that stage he became a little agitated about not getting it that night , ' @entity157 told the @entity161 courtroom			0
the dive computer , which @entity12 wore on his wrist while diving is considered key by the prosecution to prove its case that @entity12 lied to investigator			1
prosecutors contend that shortly after @entity12 and his wife entered the water for their drive , @entity12 signaled to his wife to return to the boat because his dive computer was beeping , indicating the battery was incorrectly installed			1
he borrowed a coin from someone on the boat to remove the battery and turned it around , and the couple continued their dive			0
prosecutors believe that it was a ploy to get his wife away from other divers so he could drown her			0
they also argue that a dive computer would n't beep if the battery was installed incorrectly - it would stay silent			1
facing closure : @entity190 and @entity191 will finally see their former son - in - law tried for their daughter 's murder when the case begins monday in an @entity44 courtroom @entity12 's lawyer , @entity197 , intends to present testimony that the @entity4 police never contacted the computer 's manufacturer to see if the dive computer beeps when the battery is in upside down			1
@entity12 ’s defence team claimed the prosecution is based on ‘ bumbling ’ detectives in @entity4 believing that a problem with a dive computer on his wrist proved he killed the woman he loved			1
that mistake early in the investigation made police wrongly see innocent actions and circumstances as proof of a crime , defence lawyer @entity59 told the court in @entity43 , @entity44			2
' @entity107 trusted her husband , ’ mr @entity222 told the court , while @entity12 ’s new wife @entity224 , who bears a strong resemblance to @entity109 , sat listening			1
‘ she felt safe diving with him			0
’ rather than being murdered , @entity107 struggled and knocked off her husband 's air supply and diving mask , forcing him to resurface without her , mr @entity59 said			2
she drowned on her own , he said			0
‘ this is a tragic case , ’ mr @entity59 said			0
‘ what 's even more tragic is the blame @entity234 has had to live with this last number of years			0
’ he added that @entity107 ’s father was the beneficiary on her life insurance			0
that policy was worth only $ 33,000 , not the $ 165,000 claimed by prosecutors , he said , and a travel policy for $ 45,000 was only to cover the cost of the trip			0
‘ there was no financial motive , ’ mr @entity59 said			0
mr @entity59 argued that @entity12 contributed to her own death by waiving an orientation dive and placing too much weight in a device meant to help her stay underwater during the dive			2
she panicked once during a diving class in a flooded suburban rock quarry , mr @entity59 said , suggesting that she may have panicked again in the fatal dive			0
' this is a tragic case			0
what 's even more tragic is the blame @entity234 has had to live with this last number of years ' @entity59 , defending mr @entity59 denied prosecution claims that @entity12 was a highly trained rescue diver who should have been able to save @entity107 , and instead said they were both ‘ very inexperienced ’ underwater			1
@entity12 initially was charged with murder in @entity4 , after @entity107 ’s body was found near @entity58 , @entity21 , but he pleaded guilty to a lesser manslaughter charge and served 18 months in prison			2
a grand jury in @entity44 also indicted him for capital murder as he allegedly planned his new bride 's death while still in the state			1
a judge granted a defence motion to have one murder count dropped			0
remarried : @entity11 remarried , to @entity224 , pictured , after being released from prison in @entity4 @entity273 : the newlyweds were diving at the @entity275 off @entity4 when @entity107 died before @entity4 authorities would release @entity12 to the @entity278 , @entity44 had to agree to waive the death penalty as a possible punishment , prosecutors said			1
he faces life in prison if convicted			0
' there was no financial motive ' @entity59 , defending @entity4 authorities performed exhaustive tests to try to recreate @entity12 's death , which occurred soon after the couple 's wedding			1
a coroner ’s report threw up some interesting ideas			0
@entity107 was an inexperienced diver and he had rescue certification , the report said			0
the @entity44 trial poses logistical challenges , as up to a dozen witnesses will be flown in from @entity4 to testify			0
the state of @entity44 has also subpoenaed people from @entity301 to testify about what happened that day on a dive boat called the @entity304 , but it 's unclear how many will take the stand			2

admitted in police interview other divers may have thought ' something odd was going on ' during his wife 's last moments underwater
