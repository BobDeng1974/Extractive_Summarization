by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:47 est , 25 february 2014 @entity3 offer plenty of opportunity for tv pundits but the two biggest managerial names look to have priced themselves out of contention			0
@entity10 ’s representatives are understood to have asked for £ 250,000 for the world ’s best - paid boss to be part of @entity15 ’s coverage of the semi-finals and final in @entity18 in 2010			1
and it is believed it would take that sort of offer , or more , to tempt @entity23 to be a tv analyst in @entity25			1
@entity41 has taken personal responsibility for the project , writing a lot of the conclusions himself despite his numerous other business interests			2
he is expected to pinpoint where the process is wrong on the pathway from grassroots football to selection for the @entity37 senior team			1
task ahead : @entity40 chairman @entity41 will present an interim report into the findings from the commission criticism : board member @entity58 said the @entity37 did not have enough ethnic diversity an obvious major problem is the number of potential international players who fall by the wayside through lack of opportunity in the 18 to 21 age group			1
two solutions discussed are a quota system to ensure a set number of @entity71 players in club academies — championed by commission member @entity73 — and the introduction of @entity76 feeder clubs			2
but highlighting the difficulties @entity41 faces in bringing about change are that quotas are against @entity81 law and would be strongly opposed by the @entity76 — as would feeder clubs by the @entity83 , whose members dismissed the idea at their last meeting			2
more likely is beefing up a @entity76 under 21/23 competition to give young players a springboard			0
wish : @entity41 seeks to allow more young @entity71 talent like @entity92 to come through the ranks added : @entity95 defender @entity94 was added to the commission get me out : @entity37 players had to wait around for hours after the gut - wrenching defeat in @entity100 the amateur traditions of the @entity102 seem increasingly at odds with the elite professional game			1
it has emerged that @entity37 captain @entity106 told management that the players were tired of the speeches and wanted to go when the @entity111 reception after the @entity100 game dragged on past midnight			1
@entity114 ’s wife @entity113 had to intervene to ensure the @entity115 had a seat on the @entity37 coach back to the hotel after the late night as no provision had been made for their transport			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity122 2015 have surprisingly decided against having their own @entity34 mascot on parade around the grounds			1
part of the complication is that rugby ’s ruling body the @entity130 hold licensing rights and have signed popular children ’s animation figure @entity134 to help promotion			0
@entity136 2012 , from where a considerable number of @entity138 staff were hired , received a mixed response for their @entity143 mascot wenlock			0
@entity144 on @entity145 @entity146 , whose new £ 300,000 - a - week @entity95 contract has the club ’s commercial hot house helping him maximise his personal earnings , is likely to be centre stage during @entity37 ’s @entity152 week in @entity144			1
@entity37 shirt suppliers @entity153 are sure to want to get @entity146 alongside their marquee basketball star @entity154 of @entity144 — another swoosh team			1
@entity146 ’s astonishing new deal is slightly more than @entity154 earns from his club but the @entity160 rakes in another £ 25million a year from endorsements			0
the @entity40 have a tentative invite to watch the @entity163 play - offs that week if @entity144 qualify and the date suits the training schedule			2
back on court in @entity144 : @entity146 , seen here with then - girlfriend @entity168 at an @entity163 game between @entity170 and @entity171 in 2006 , may be shooting some hoops alongside @entity154 this summer @entity37 manager @entity173 outflanked representatives from all the home nations subject to a long wait at @entity177 when the last @entity179 flight back to @entity180 was delayed after the @entity182 draw in @entity183			1
@entity173 and his @entity40 colleagues quickly grabbed the final three seats on a @entity187 flight even though it meant travelling in economy			0
@entity190 sponsors @entity191 , who announced they would not be renewing their shirt sponsorship when striker @entity194 was allowed to continue to play after his quenelle gesture , told the club they did not expect to be invited into the directors ’ box as a result			0
but @entity190 have still made the property company representatives welcome whenever they want to attend a game			0
still welcome : @entity190 sponsors @entity191 will still be invited into the directors ' box despite not renewing their deal following the controversy surrounding @entity194 's ' quenelle ' gesture ( below ) controversy : @entity194 performs the ' quenelle ' after scoring against @entity211 in december			0

@entity10 and @entity23 would be *expensive* for tv companies
@entity10 's representatives asked for £ 250,000 in 2010
interim report from @entity41 's @entity37 *due* on thursday
problems lie ahead for @entity40 chairman 's report on @entity71 game
the @entity37 rugby team were tired of the speeches after the defeat by @entity227 in @entity100 earlier this month
@entity122 2015 decide against @entity34 mascot
