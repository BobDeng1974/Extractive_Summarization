after the 2001 terrorist attacks , @entity1 lawmakers sought a way to channel the patriotic fervour and use it to help victims ' families and law enforcement			1
their answer : specialty memorial license plates emblazoned with the words , ' we will never forget			2
' part of the money raised through the sale of the plates was to fund scholarships for the children of @entity1 residents who perished in the attacks , while the majority - 85 per cent - was to help fund anti-terrorism efforts			1
but an @entity22 review of the $ 15 million collected since lawmakers approved the ' @entity24 ' shows only a small fraction of the money went to scholarships			1
never forget : @entity26 has a license plate commemorating 9/11 ; her nephew @entity28 was one of the passengers of @entity30 patriotic : @entity1 lawmakers issued specialty memorial license plates , but an @entity22 investigation revealed much of the $ 15million made since 2001 has n't gone where it should while 40 per cent has funded anti-terror training programs , $ 3 million was raided by gov. @entity36 and his predecessor , @entity37 , to plug the state 's budget deficit			1
millions more have been spent on budget items with little relation to direct threats of terrorism , including livestock diseases and workplace safety			2
moreover , the @entity46 has been advertising the plates as helping the children of sept. 11 victims even though the state stopped funding the scholarship program seven years ago			2
the specialty plate fund continues to take in $ 1.5 million a year			1
@entity1 who lost loved ones in the attacks take the raid on the license plate fund as an affront to the memory of those who died			1
' i ca n't believe that they would do that , ' said @entity26 , who lives in the @entity62 and bought a plate to commemorate her nephew , @entity28			0
' we 're paying extra for the plate ; we 're making a point , and it means a lot to us			0
' mr @entity28 was killed on @entity30 , which crashed in @entity68 , and was one of the passengers who led the attempt to wrest control from the hijackers			0
his mother , @entity74 , also was troubled by the program 's apparent drift from its original purpose			2
' i 'm sorry that as we retreat in time from 9/11 , we seem to be retreating in our resolve never to forget , ' she said in a telephone interview			2
the plates , which cost an initial $ 50 plus a $ 40 annual renewal fee , feature an @entity85 flag partially obscured by clouds and the ' never forget ' slogan			1
residents of @entity1 , where all four jetliners were bound when they were hijacked , have bought or renewed the plates more than 200,000 times since 2002			2
in memoriam : @entity28 ( left ) was a passenger on @entity30 ; the aircraft crashed outside @entity94 , @entity68 on september 11 , 2001 investigators flocked to the @entity68 field where @entity30 went down ; @entity1 residents are upset that the money meant for relief for victim 's families were not used for that purpose of the other states directly associated with the 2001 attacks , only @entity103 has established a similar specialty plate program			1
yet it did not set up a special fund for the proceeds of its ' @entity111 ' plate			2
for the past decade , the @entity46 has said on its website that the money will ' fund scholarships for the children of @entity1 who died in the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks and helps @entity1 's law enforcement fight threats of terrorism			1
' it advertises the program with the slogan , ' be a patriot			0
' while the @entity46 description of the program was not ' totally disingenuous , ' the department should probably remove references to the scholarship program , said @entity128 , a spokesman for the state treasurer 's office , which disburses the money			2
' it 's out of date and it 's on @entity46 to update that , ' he said			2
late friday , the department modified the description of the license plate on its website to remove the reference to the scholarship program in response to the investigation by the @entity22 , which began in march			1
spokeswoman @entity143 said the reason promotional materials were not updated sooner was ' unknown			0
' the @entity46 still lists the scholarship program on the online and hard copy form drivers fill out to buy the license plates , but @entity149 said the department will change this next time the forms are printed			0
the legislation establishing the plates had earmarked 15 per cent of the revenue for scholarships			0
yet only $ 21,381 has reached the children and spouses of the three dozen @entity1 residents killed during the terrorist attacks			1
the state treasurer 's office closed the scholarship program in 2005 , the sign - up deadline for potential recipients , and has $ 60,000 in reserve			1
the borrowers : @entity1 gov. @entity36 , left , and former @entity1 governor @entity37 , right , borrowed a respective $ 3million from the fund to close budget gaps the total amount dedicated to scholarships was 1.5 per cent of the $ 5.5 million raised through the sale of the plates through 2005			1
the original legislation said the remainder of the money would go to ' law enforcement , fire protection , and public health agencies ' to be used ' exclusively for purposes directly related to fighting terrorism			1
' but in 2008 , former gov. @entity37 , a @entity182 , borrowed $ 2 million to close a budget gap			1
last year , @entity36 , a @entity184 , borrowed another $ 1 million			1
neither loan has been repaid nor are their deadlines to ensure they will be			0
@entity189 , a spokeswoman for @entity36 , said the loans have done no harm			1
' we 're trying to simultaneously balance the budget and fund important programs , ' she said			1
' if there was an indication that borrowing this money was going to negatively impact this program , we would n't borrow the money			0
' the rest of the money has gone to a wide array of budgets and programs			0
the @entity204 sent $ 3.7million to the @entity205 , according to the @entity206 , to establish an online food monitoring database and implement a variety of worker safety programs , including hiring industrial hygienists to tend to worker health			0
but it is difficult to say precisely where the money has gone			0
late friday , the agriculture department delivered documents it said were in response to a @entity218 request the @entity22 filed eight weeks earlier			1
the response contained itemized budget reports going back six years and listing payments for all types of government functions , ranging from salaries and benefits , to printing costs and communication equipment			2
among the details : $ 18,163 for furniture in 2006 and $ 11,492 for auto inspection in 2009			0
capital job : of the $ 15million collected , $ 3million was borrowed to close the state budget , another $ 3.7million was sent to the @entity1 @entity233 , and $ 18,163 for furniture in 2009 alone the response also included a legislative report on the threats the agriculture department is targeting with an online database the license plate program helps fund			1
a similar report from 2006 , when the license plate money was first authorized , lists bio-terrorism as a potential danger			0
but the 2011 report focuses on food safety and livestock concerns , including foot - and - mouth disease and meat and poultry monitoring			0
director of animal health and food safety services @entity252 said the department does not track license plate money separately from other funds			0
she said it would be wasteful to reserve the money exclusively for anti-terrorism work			0
for example , the department uses some of the money to buy safety suits that would be essential during an anthrax attack but also are useful for routine food investigations			0
' the things that i worry about in the animal food safety division are very high consequence events , but very infrequent			0
so i always try to leverage those resources , ' she said			0
another $ 2million has gone to programs that aim to protect @entity1 from all manner of potential threats , not just those related to terrorism			0
the @entity276 used nearly $ 1 million in memorial license plate money for general operations , including administrative costs , buying and fueling cars , and hiring a person from 2007 to 2009 to coordinate five so - called ' fusion centers , ' according to documents obtained through a @entity218 request			1
it 's kind of a given these days - nothing is spent on what it 's supposed to be			2
' - former @entity1 resident @entity289 the other $ 1 million went directly to the fusion centers , which were founded after the 2001 attacks to focus on terrorist threats but have since switched to an ' all crimes ' approach that includes gang activity and natural disasters			1
@entity297 , who wrote the license plate bill when he was speaker of the @entity299 , said he was saddened to hear how the money had been spent			0
' i understand the financial climate they find themselves in , but they are not following the spirit and intent of the legislation , ' said @entity297 , now president of the @entity309			0
' the lion 's share of the money was supposed to be given to local law enforcement so that they could beef up their anti-terrorism operations			1
' about 40 per cent of the total raised to date , or $ 6million , has gone to anti-terrorism training programs for fire - fighters and law enforcement officers			1
there is a slight discrepancy between the @entity46 's revenue figures and the @entity206 's expenditure figures that neither agency could explain			0
@entity289 , who paid $ 98 for a personalized memorial plate reading ' we @entity324 , ' said she signed up for the program primarily to show respect for victims of the 9/11 attacks			1
ms @entity289 said she was disheartened but not surprised to learn that much of the money has gone to fill the state deficit or used for general purposes			0
' that 's @entity1 , ' said ms @entity289 , who now lives near @entity333 , @entity334			0
' it 's kind of a given these days - nothing is spent on what it 's supposed to be			2

$ 15million collected since plates began being offered after 9/11 terrorist attacks - meant to help victim 's families and law enforcement
former gov. @entity37 borrowed $ 2 million to close a budget gap ; last year , gov. @entity36 borrowed another $ 1 million
neither has repaid what they borrowed
