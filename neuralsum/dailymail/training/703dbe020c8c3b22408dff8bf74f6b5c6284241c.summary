by @entity0 a @entity2 designer who has become known for his melancholy style presents his latest collection of feminine and edgy separates on models with what appear to be rather badly bruised knees			1
@entity9 , born in @entity10 but raised in @entity11 , a sensitive , self - confessed introvert , called his latest offering @entity13			1
his collection of bug - embossed netting , clashing textures and gothic lace - up boots was shown shown on the fourth day of the 080 @entity19 2014 yesterday			1
a model presents a satin drop waist dress with painful - looking knees as a quirky outfit of clashing textures is offset by a bashed - up beauty look influences appeared to be romantic , retro , sports and @entity29			1
while some models sashayed down the catwalk in cute drop - waist frocks others exposed plenty of flesh in micro crop tops and large hole mesh - and many sported those disturbing bruised knees			2
the models ' bashed - up beauty look , according to @entity9 's sombre description of the range , may represent a metaphor for a bruised feelings and a broken heart			2
the designer , who 's worked in fashion for more than a decade , describes his latest collection and cryptic though it may be , it does offer some explanation for his seemingly ' wounded ' models			2
' let 's talk about the first kiss , hidden from the world , in a corner			0
tell me what you think of my life , of my adolescence			0
in a corner i treat my wounds , and my tears will be lost in the rain			0
i extend my hand , seeking to touch you , leaving the world , cleansing my body of your scent , like an idiot searching for lost rites			0
i 'm going mad , everything tortures me , but i know how to love			0
' the catwalk showcasing of @entity74 's latest collection called @entity13 , on the fourth day of the 080 @entity19 event @entity9 moved back to @entity10 in 2002 where he studied @entity77 , and after a brief working period as part of @entity81 's design team he decided to start working on his own collection			1
the designer , who loves complexities in fashion , said his work is about little details , @entity88 , and artisanal aspects - and that he would always choose texture over colour - in an interview with @entity93 magazine late last year			0
he cites - somewhat unsurprisingly - @entity94 and @entity95 as inspiration			0
