by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity2 supporters have praised the club after the announcement of new plans that could lead to an expansion of @entity7			1
the @entity9 outfit announced on tuesday that owner @entity10 had commissioned a study to look at ways in which their 109 - year home could be expanded - including a new proposal to build decking over the restrictive train track to the east and north of the ground			0
and the @entity19 have spoken out to say that they welcome the new development in @entity2 's long - running stadium saga and the attempts to expand @entity7 - an apparent u-turn from the club 's previous attempts to move away to the likes of @entity27 and @entity28			1
blue heaven : @entity2 are exploring options regarding the expansion of their home ground , @entity7 @entity34 nights : @entity36 regulations have increased @entity2 's need for an increased capacity the statement from the @entity19 also offers @entity2 existing comments and suggestions from local residents recorded by the trust that could help @entity2 in the initial consultation phase of the study			1
@entity7 's capacity currently sits at 41,837 and the @entity48 have previously explored the possibility of moving to nearby @entity28 power station and @entity27 , options which are no longer there			2
by potentially utilising decking over the railway lines to the east and north of the ground @entity2 believe they could get around the obstacles associated with expansion on their relatively small @entity9 site			2
boy in blue : new signing @entity64 could be playing in front of a bigger @entity7 crowd @entity2 had previously been accused by shareholders in @entity69 ( @entity69 ) - the fan - led company which owns the land beneath @entity7 - of not fully exploring the possibility of staying put before attempting to buy back the stadium freehold in october 2011			2
that was seen as a precursor to a move to a new 60,000 - seater ground , something @entity2 are unable to do before convincing @entity69 to sell up - and @entity10 and @entity2 now seem to have made a significant u-turn			0
a potential expansion would help @entity2 to boost their matchday revenue			0
@entity7 is currently the @entity84 's eighth largest ground			1
a 60,000 capacity would improve that ranking to third			0
familiar : @entity2 have spent their entire history at @entity7 and the new plans could see them stay the @entity89 welcomes the recent announcement by @entity2 regarding commissioning a study of the area from @entity95 @entity94 town centre to @entity7 and beyond			1
we particularly welcome the fact that “ the study will also assess the feasibility of an expansion of the stadium within the existing historic site boundaries ”			0
we note that the study specifically excludes “ any design or details of a redevelopment on the stadium site ” which presumably would wait until the study report has been published and decisions made			0
as well as engaging stakeholders such as the local community and residents groups , which is clearly essential , we urge the club to actively involve @entity2 supporters in the study ( and the implementation of the study results ) , which is clearly of significant importance to all @entity2 supporters			1
we will pass on to those conducting the study the comments and suggestions we have received from members of the local community following extensive door to door leafleting that we have carried out in the area over the last year , as well as ideas we have been given with regard to @entity129			0
the @entity19 are keen to work with the various parties involved in the study , as the stadium issue is of fundamental interest to our members , as was made clear in the @entity135			0
home : @entity2 have spent 109 years at @entity7 since the club was founded in 1905			1

@entity2 announce plans to seek solutions to their ground capacity *problem*
@entity7 holds just 41,837 supporters , the eighth largest in @entity144
@entity2 @entity19 speak out to ' welcome ' the new study
trust offer club existing data ahead of *speaking* to local residents groups
