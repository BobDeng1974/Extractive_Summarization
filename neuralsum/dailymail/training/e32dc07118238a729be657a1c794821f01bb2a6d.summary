the ghostly pest then vanishes out of shot before reappearing on the opposite side of the road			1
mother - of - two @entity13 , who works as a doctor ’s receptionist , said : ' the image of a child jumped over my fence , landed over the roof of my car , flew down the street and flew back			1
' i ’m absolutely gobsmacked by this			0
i ’ve got the footage here , it ’s the image of a young child about four or five			0

it was one of those weird feelings where you just think to yourself , ‘ what on earth is it ? ’ ' it looks like @entity91 the friendly ghost but it was certainly leaping all over the bonnet of our @entity26			2
