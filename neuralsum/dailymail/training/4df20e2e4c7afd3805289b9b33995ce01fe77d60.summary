amid the political boiling oil of three simultaneous scandals , @entity1 press secretary @entity0 continued monday to defend the @entity6 administration 's handling of troubles involving the @entity8			1
but reporters ' eyebrows raised when he said that @entity1 chief of staff @entity11 knew about abuses taking place in the @entity14 and decided not to tell the president			1
in a briefing that started 45 minutes late after a one - hour announced delay , @entity0 said that ' no one in this building intervened in an ongoing , independent investigation ' by the @entity14 @entity20 , which was examining ' line @entity14 employees ' who were targeting conservative groups for special scrutiny			1
' we did not have a copy of the draft report , we did not know the details , the scope , or the motivation surrounding the misconduct , ' @entity0 said			1
' and we did not know who was responsible			0
' but he confirmed that on april 24 @entity33 , the @entity34 , was notified about the investigation			2
he also said the @entity1 chief of staff learned about it , as ' some other members of the senior staff - i do n't have a list			1
' they decided , @entity0 recalled , to keep @entity6 in the dark			1
' some matters are inappropriate to convey to him , ' @entity0 said			1
' it is entirely appropriate that the president not be notified ' of ongoing investigations , ' he told reporters			0
' the suggestion of alerting him is that he should do something , ' perhaps prematurely			0
@entity57 ( r ) is a @entity58 reporter whose personal emails , phone records , and entry logs into federal buildings were snooped on by the @entity63 on april 16 , he added , the @entity64 had received a ' top line , ' non-specific notification that an investigative report would be forthcoming			1
' @entity68 also got briefings , ' @entity0 said , referring to members of @entity71 on @entity72			2
and like the @entity1 , he said , @entity71 took no action			1
' the cardinal rule , ' he insisted , is that ' you do not intervene in an independent investigation			1
' polls show an increasing number of @entity79 believe the @entity14 's targeting of tea party groups , the @entity81 's involvement in sanitizing a @entity83 assessment of the 2012 @entity85 terror attack and the @entity63 's investigation of reporters at the @entity88 are serious problems that have caused them to lose faith in the president and his team			2
@entity33 embraced president @entity6 upon the news that the @entity97 had upheld the @entity99 law , as then - @entity1 chief of staff @entity100 ( @entity53 ) looked on on monday , @entity58 chief @entity101 correspondent @entity57 became the second @entity104 casualty in the @entity6 administration 's probes into journalists ' sources and communications			1
the @entity110 reported monday that the @entity63 investigated @entity57 's contacts with a @entity81 source , tracking his phone calls , rummaging through his personal emails and tracing his entries into and exits from government buildings			0
@entity0 refused monday to comment on ' an ongoing investigation , ' falling back on previous statements that straddled the line between press freedoms and national security			2
@entity6 , he said , is ' a strong believer in the first amendment ' but also ' insistent that we protect our secrets ' as a nation			2
' we take very seriously the leaks of classified information , ' he added , ' referring to both the @entity88 and @entity58 cases			0
but he would n't answer a question from @entity58 about whether the while @entity1 believes @entity57 is a criminal because he did his job and developed a source inside the @entity81			2
and he dodged a question about how he personally views the scandal			0
@entity0 was the @entity136 before joining the @entity6 administration			1
' i 'm here as a spokesman for the president , ' he insisted , before saying ' we need to find a balance ' between protecting journalists ' constitutional rights and preventing leaks of classified information to the media			0
@entity57 reported in june 2009 that @entity148 would respond to new @entity150 sanctions by conducting a new round of nuclear tests			0
that report was based on a confidential source whom the @entity63 has now identified			0
@entity0 continued to face brutally frank questions from reporters who may feel their ability to do their jobs without government interference has now been threatened by the @entity6 administration reaction from the press corps in general has been fast and furious , even bringing condemnation from left - leaning reporters who typically support the president 's agenda			1
@entity169 radio host @entity168 , current tv host @entity170 and former @entity173 luminary @entity171 have called for the resignation of attorney general @entity175			0
and @entity176 , the progressive columnist at @entity177 in @entity178 , opined monday on @entity179 that ' [ a ] ccusing @entity57 of committing crimes - for basic reporting - may be the most dangerous thing the @entity6 @entity63 has done yet			2
' ' who will be the first progressive pundit to defend the criminalization of @entity57 's report by the @entity6 @entity63 or argue it 's no big deal ? ' he asked his social media audience			2
despite president @entity6 's claims on may 16 that he was unaware of the storm swirling around the @entity14 until media reports on may 10 put it on @entity79 's front - burner , news emerged monday that @entity33 was briefed on the agency 's program targeting tea party groups and other political adversaries of the president in april			1
full press briefing rooms have been the norm at the @entity1 since a trio of scandals broke earlier in may			2
@entity0 is the @entity6 administration 's designated flak - catcher , parrying journalists ' questions as nerves in the press corps fray @entity6 told reporters on thursday that ' i can assure you that i certainly did not know anything about the report ' from the @entity14 inspector general before portions of it were leaked to the media			1
observers on the political right have speculated that either @entity6 was untruthful , or his @entity1 is dysfunctional enough to lack a clear line of communication between the president and his top lawyer on matters of high importance to the @entity79 people			1
@entity0 also said ' no ' to a question about whether or not the @entity1 knew @entity229 chief @entity228 was planning to plant a question at an @entity232 conference on may 10 about the @entity234 scrutiny - the action that launched the scandal			1
@entity238 lawmakers have come down on the @entity14 especially hard , grilling the now - former acting @entity14 commissioner in a @entity241 hearing on friday and gearing up for committee bloodbaths tuesday and wednesday , in the @entity243 and the @entity244			0
@entity245 @entity238 senator @entity238 suggested sunday on television that the @entity14 had a written policy '' outlining how agents should single out right - wing groups for audits and other special scrutiny , ' targeting people who were opposed to the president			0
' sen. @entity238 spoke at a may 16 press conference in @entity101 with tea party leaders including @entity257 @entity256 rep. @entity256 ( @entity53 ) sen. @entity238 claimed sunday there was a ' written policy ' inside the @entity14 aimed at ' targeting people who were opposed to the president ' ' we need to know who wrote the policy and who approved the policy , ' sen. @entity238 told @entity269 anchor @entity268			1
' we keep hearing the reports and we have several specifically worded items saying who was being targeted			0
in fact , one of the bullet points says " those who are critical of the president , " he said			0
among the arguments @entity14 officials have made for their dramatic increase in scrutiny of tea party groups is the claim that applications for nonprofit tax - exempt status increased substantially in the wake of the @entity97 's ' @entity288 ' ruling , which cleared the way for such groups to enter into the political arena			0
but the @entity110 ran a ' @entity293 ' article on monday giving that claim a dubious ' @entity296 ' rating for untruthfulness			0
@entity228 , head of the @entity14 's exempt organizations office admitted to targeting conservative organizations for special scrutiny , attributing it to a ' very big uptick ' between 2010 and 2012 in the number of applications her office received for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) tax - exempt status			0
the @entity110 reported that the increase ' was relatively small , ' however			0
' the real jump did not come until 2011 , long after the targeting of conservative groups had been implemented ' in may 2010 , wrote the @entity110 's fact checker			0
a recently released @entity14 inspector general 's report indicated that 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) applications actually declined between 2009 and 2010 , from 1,751 to 1,735			1
the @entity110 adjusted those numbers to reflect a calendar year instead of the federal government 's fiscal year , and found a slight increase in the rate of applications per year , from 1,745 to 1,865 .			0

@entity1 did n't take action on a politicized @entity14 , @entity0 said . ' the cardinal rule ' is that ' you do not intervene in an independent investigation '
@entity6 was n't told about @entity14 scandal because ' some matters are inappropriate to convey to him '
@entity1 got first whiff of inspector general report on april 16
