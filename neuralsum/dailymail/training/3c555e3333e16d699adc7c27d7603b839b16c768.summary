by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 20:03 est , 3 june 2013 on a fine summer ’s morning i love to go out into my garden early , before most of the world is awake , and gather one of my favourite harvests			1
this is a small basket of roses , still glittering with dew			1
these are then spilt onto the kitchen table and arranged in up to half a dozen vases , which i place around the house , with their fragrance gently rising from them like wisps of unseen smoke			0
there is none of the florist ’s skill in this			0
there is nothing i could do to make the roses more lovely than they already are			1
in the border or in a vase , these are floral royalty			0
alluring : @entity0 says the attraction of the rose is irrational , because it taps into a deep vein of romance that lies within the most hardened heart expert : the seasoned gardener has seen some of the world 's most exotic plants and flowers , but still rates the traditional rose above them all they are intoxicating and irresistible and roses play on our deep , instinctive responses more than any other plant , which is perhaps why they have just been voted the nation ’s favourite flower			1
we can rationalise this attraction as much as we like , but in the end roses tap into a deep vein of romance that lies within the most hardened heart			1
the rose — the word comes from the @entity53 ( red ) and early cultivated roses were largely crimson in colour — has inspired arts and artisans throughout the centuries and its flowers appear in paintings as far back as 2000 bc. the oldest fossil record of a plant clearly identifiable as a member of what botanists call the genus @entity68 comes from the @entity70 rock formation more than 30 million years ago , and petrified rose wreaths have been unearthed from @entity73 tombs			1
under @entity79 , in enclosed gardens from the @entity76 in @entity77 to @entity78 , the rose was celebrated as a symbol of perfection			0
its subtle yet direct magic has always cast a spell			0
above all , roses are the most direct floral expression of love			1
on @entity94 — when we are still in the grip of winter and not a single rose is blooming in the @entity93 — a huge number are sold : this year nearly three million ‘ flower gifts ’ consisting of up to a dozen roses			1
in the @entity98 , more than 198 million red roses were bought			1
one irony is that most of these roses will be soulless and scentless , grown in polytunnels , designed to be identical and without character			1
a garden rose filled with fragrance , on the other hand , is truly intoxicating and i suspect the power of scent plays a much greater part in this unavoidable attraction than we realise			0
the reason most of us love roses is the combination of the delicacy of the scent and the incredible voluptuousness of the flowers , ranging from an almost wistful delicacy in a rose such as @entity122 to the impossibly full convolutions of a centifolia such as @entity124 or @entity125			1
@entity68 scent rarely wafts on the air ; you have to nuzzle up to them and intimately smell their fragrance as you might savour the bouquet of a fine wine			0
i grow centifolias , damasks , albas , gallicas , bourbons , hybrid perpetuals , moss roses and rugosas			1
all have superb scents , but my favourites are the albas , which somehow manage to be both delicate and lingering in the nose			0
appeal : the reason most of us love roses is the combination of the delicacy of the scent and the incredible voluptuousness of the flowers this scent of fresh roses has an active ingredient called phenylethylamine ( also contained , intriguingly , in chocolate ) which contains an amino acid known to slow the breakdown of the endorphin hormone			1
so a bunch of roses and a box of chocolates is more than just a romantic gesture			1
they actually induce a chemical enhancement of wellbeing and romance			0
certainly , a garden with several shrub and climbing roses , burdened with flowers in midsummer , is as near to a romantic heaven as we are likely to find on this earth			1
in @entity179 mythology , @entity177 was not only the goddess of love but also the goddess of gardens and fruitfulness , and the rose was sacred to her			1
the blood - pure flower , so universally accepted as a definition of loveliness , was adopted by early @entity188 as the symbol of the @entity190 , the five petals representing the five senses , and the thorns the tribulations of life that have to be braved to reach the flower			2
i grow a lot of roses in my garden and have ramblers scrambling up apple trees , climbers on my walls and scores of shrub varieties in my borders			2
although i love the richness of red roses such as @entity211 or the rich burgundy of souvenir du dr @entity213 — one of the few roses that is better grown in shade — no colour becomes a rose better than pink			1
my favourite of all is a full , many - petalled flower that is a delicate , almost shy pink called @entity221 , which literally means ‘ thigh of a nymph ’ — the mythological beautiful girls that were spirits of nature — but which was translated by the rather shocked @entity227 as ‘ @entity228 ’			2
by any name , it is a seductive rose			0
@entity177 : in @entity179 mythology she was not only the goddess of love but also the goddess of gardens and fruitfulness we think of roses being a very @entity239 flower but , although we have 14 native wild roses , the multi-petalled roses that we all recognise and love originate from the @entity243 and were bought to this country by @entity245 when they returned home			1
of course , in the @entity251 the emblems of the two warring houses , @entity249 and @entity250 , were the white @entity252 for @entity249 and the red @entity253 for the @entity254			0
neither is native to this country but the victorious @entity257 combined the two as an emblem in the symbolic and very @entity260			0
the great age of rose - breeding was the @entity264 era and @entity265 was its @entity267 centre , not least because it had a climate in the south of the country that many roses prefer to the rather soggy , @entity272 of @entity267			2
last summer , i visited @entity274 , the garden of @entity277 ’s wife @entity276 , who set out to collect every rose in the world			0
at that time , this was thought to be some 250 types			0
classic : roses have become the traditional @entity94 gift , and a symbol for love the world over by 1910 , the first garden dedicated just to roses , @entity290 , in the southern suburbs of @entity292 , had 8,000 different roses , which was then every variety and species known			1
for flowers with such sensuous , delicate petals , roses are surprisingly tough plants			2
there is much fetishisation of their pruning , but research has shown that a chainsaw or hedge - trimmer does as good a job as the most artful work with secateurs — and that , left to their own devices , most roses live long and flower prodigiously			1
my advice to any new gardener wanting to include roses in a garden but uncertain how best to treat them is to plant them deep , mulch them thickly every spring , dead - head regularly but otherwise let them get on with it			2
they are the least troublesome of plants			0
but it is not their toughness that we celebrate , nor their ease for the gardener , however we prune them			0
their real magic is found as a bowl of roses picked that morning from the garden , touched with dew , glowing with silky colour and filling the room with subtle but sublime fragrance			2
to enjoy roses at their most perfect , here are some of the finest gardens to visit this month			2
@entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 @entity351 ’s garden has a superb collection of ‘ @entity353 ’ or shrub roses , many planted more than 60 years ago , forming one of the country ’s most romantic rose gardens			2
@entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 the roses in this @entity363 garden were collected by the great rosarian @entity365 , who died ten years ago , and the walled garden was planted in 1972			2
to see it in its late - june splendour remains one of the great gardening experiences			0
@entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 in 2006 , the @entity376 , which features more than 200 types of rose , was given the award of @entity380 by the @entity381 — the first time any @entity93 garden had received this accolade			0
@entity384 , @entity385 the gardens of this spectacular mansion include a modern rose garden within the 18th - century walled garden , with a wide collection of old and modern roses			0
@entity392 , @entity393 , @entity360 this is the home of the @entity395 and is dedicated solely to the cultivation and celebration of roses of every kind			0
it is open from this saturday , june 8 , to july 28 , though members may visit throughout the year .			0
