by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 23:15 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 20 november 2013 serial killer @entity4 was granted a stay of execution tuesday only hours before he was set to die of lethal injection in a @entity9 jail			1
mr @entity4 , 63 , and his legal team were able to successfully argue the state was at risk of violating the @entity14 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment by using pentobarbital as an execution drug			1
the drug is slowly starting to replace previously used lethal injection cocktails because drug manufacturers will no longer provide them to @entity22 prisons			0
through the years : @entity4 as seen in a series of booking photos from 2005 to 2012 the neo-nazi who claims he tried to start a race war in the late 1970s was scheduled to die at 12.01am wednesday morning will instead likely be sleeping inside his cell only days after confessing to killing 17 more people than previously confirmed			2
the state had originally planned to use propofol , the same drug that killed @entity33 from an overdose , but recent shortages forced officials to find an alternative			0
a judge ruled tuesday afternoon that a lawsuit filed on behalf of mr @entity4 and 20 other @entity9 inmates on death row contending arguing the dangers of propofol must be resolved before anyone can be executed			1
lawyers for the serial killer have argued the drug can cause contamination and pain above and beyond thresholds allowed by the @entity49 - which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment			2
the judge agreed , writing that the state ' has not provided any information about the certification , inspection history , infraction history , or other aspects of the compounding pharmacy or of the person compounding the drug			0
' a separate ruling from another judge called mr @entity4 's mental capacity into question , and said his mental illness should be reviewed before he is put to death			1
his mental state is such that he was n't even aware he was on death row			2
' he was happy , ' his attorney told the @entity69			0
' i ’m not really convinced that he totally understands that he was going to die			0
' the state appealed the appeals court ruling as it relates to the use of pentobarbital , reported the @entity69			0
it is not clear if the ruling regarding mr @entity4 's mental state will also be appealed			1
tools of hate : this grab from @entity81 shows the rifle and guitar case carried by the notorious serial killer mentally detached : mr @entity4 's lawyer says he was likely unaware he was on death row mr @entity4 earlier this week confirmed to @entity81 he was responsible for the cold - blooded execution - style deaths of ' approximately ' 22 people			1
he was devoid of emotion as he attempted to justify his killings - which famously included an attempt on the life of @entity94 porn supremo @entity93 - who incredibly tried to stop his shooters execution			2
following his 1980 arrest , mr @entity4 told detectives that he selected the @entity100 synagogue from the @entity101 of the telephone directory because he wanted to ' find a @entity103 and kill him , ' according to reports			1
the white supremacist was also convicted in the 1977 killing of an interracial couple in @entity108 , @entity109 , as well as in the 1980 shooting deaths of two black joggers in @entity112			1
mr @entity4 's other convictions include the murders of a two teenage black boys and the bombing a synagogue in @entity118 , @entity119 in 1977			1
' i felt like i was at war			0
the survival of the white race was at stake , ' he told @entity125 of @entity81 in an interview that was to be his last before being executed			0
' i consider it my mission , my three - year mission			0
same length of time @entity130 was on his mission , from the time he was 30 to 33			0
' death row : @entity4 is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12.01am on wednesday for the sniper killing of 42 - year - old @entity136 outside a suburban @entity100 synagogue in 1977 investigators believe his cross-country crime spree was fueled by a hatred of blacks and @entity103			1
mr @entity4 confessed collared in 1980 after the @entity112 killings			1
among his alleged crimes were two high - profile shootings — of civil rights leader @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 , in 1980 , and the man he calls his ' old pal ' - porn mogul @entity93 , in @entity150 , @entity151 , in 1978			1
mr @entity4 told @entity81 he believed he was going to start a race war and that his preferred method to kill his victims was to stalk them and set up a sniper 's nest from which he pick them off using a high - powered rifle			1
seemingly still in denial , mr @entity4 tried to blame his rough childhood on his three - year orgy of violence			1
offending magazine : these are the front covers from the 1975 edition of @entity94 that enraged @entity4 ' my momma did n't care about us , ' he said , as he complained he was n't fed properly and not allowed to play with other children			2
finding another family in the white supremacist groups in the @entity172 in the 1960s , mr @entity4 felt he found his calling after reading @entity176 's political manifesto ' @entity175 '			1
' i 've never felt that way about any other book that i read , ' he said , ' it was something weird about that book			0
' at 26 , he changed his name to @entity4 to honor @entity184 propaganda minister @entity183 and founding father @entity185			2
he even attempted to link himself to infamous serial killer @entity186 by having the words ' @entity187 ' tattooed on his arm in reference to mr @entity186 's inspiration provided by @entity193 ' @entity192 '			0
the tattoo artist rebuffed the attempt , the tattoo never came			0
mr @entity4 explained that he hoped his early murders would set an example to other would - be soldiers in his one - man war on minorities			1
hatred : the neo-nazi has also been convicted of killing an interracial couple in @entity108 , @entity109 in 1977 , two black joggers in @entity112 in 1980 and bombing a synagogue in @entity118 , @entity119 in 1977 ' i figured once i started doing it and showed them how , other white supremacists would do the same thing			2
' mr @entity4 then shockingly claimed minorities he once targeted now have a kinship with him			1
' when you commit a crime against a certain group of people , a bonding takes place			0
it seems like you belong to them , ' he said			0
in addition to the murder of mr @entity136 outside a bar mitzvah , mr @entity4 was convicted of killing @entity225 and @entity226 in @entity108 , @entity109 , because they were an interracial couple			1
he also confessed to shooting dead college student @entity229 , after she told him in passing that she dated a @entity231 man			0
his most shocking murder was that of 13 - year - old @entity233 and his cousin 14 - year - old @entity234 in @entity236 - two @entity235 jogging with white female friends			0
@entity238 , who prosecuted that @entity236 case said , ' he 's just a creep			0
there 's no other way to describe him			0
and what he did to those two kids because of the color of their skin is incomprehensible			0
' victim : @entity93 says he does n't to see the man who shot him put to death @entity94 chief @entity93 was standing trial on an obscenity charge in @entity151 in 1978 when he was wounded by a sniper 's bullet			1
no one was arrested at the time , but the shooting has since been linked to mr @entity4			1
@entity256 , @entity151 , district attorney @entity257 said he is convinced @entity4 shot @entity93 because @entity4 provided information only the shooter would know — details about the shooting location , the type of weapon used , even the maker of the gun			1
the details were divulged while the killer served time in the 1990s in a @entity151 prison			2
mr @entity4 said he shot the pornographer because of a magazine front cover showing an interracial couple			1
' i saw that interracial couple he had , photographed there , having sex , ' he told @entity81 , referring to the december 1975 issue of @entity94 ' it just made me sick			0
i think whites marry with whites , blacks with blacks , @entity280 with @entity280			0
i threw the magazine down and thought , i 'm gon na kill that guy			0
' however , mr @entity257 said he opted against filing charges because @entity4 had already been convicted of multiple killings and said it did n't make sense to bring him back to @entity151 to face trial for shooting mr @entity93			1
incredibly , the @entity94 founder has become an unlikely supporter of @entity4 's - in so much as he does n't want him to face the death penalty			2
mr @entity93 would rather his shooter rot away in a prison cell			2
' the government has no business at all being in the business of killing people , ' said @entity93			2
' ( it 's ) much more punishment to put somebody in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to snip their life out in a few seconds with a lethal injection			0
' mr @entity93 's sadistic hopes have been kept alive for the time being .			2

@entity4 admitted to killing 22 people across multiple states between 1977 and 1980
he was on @entity9 death row for the 1977 killing of a @entity103 man outside a @entity100 synagogue
his lawyers argued pentobarbital was *inhumane*
