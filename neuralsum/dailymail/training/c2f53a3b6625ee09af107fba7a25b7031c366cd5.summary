by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 very few saw the funny side when @entity5 ’s @entity4 was filmed inhaling laughing gas last season			1
but the @entity9 hopeful was back to putting smiles on faces with two goals on the opening day of the season			2
his breakthrough campaign had included a hat - trick on his full debut and an @entity9 under 21 call , only to end with the ‘ hippy crack ’ controversy and team - mates blaming him for the surrender of a last - minute lead against relegation rivals @entity24			1
@entity5 , however , survived , and so did @entity4			1
and on saturday he delivered a reminder as to the talent which sees him touted as a future full international			0
the 21 - year - old converted a first - half penalty – cancelling out @entity46 ’s early stunner - and volleyed a second after the break before @entity49 salvaged a late draw for the visitors			1
but @entity4 – pacey , problematic and potent - had been the game ’s best player and insists last season ’s travails served an invaluable lesson			1
‘ i have learned a lot , ’ he said when asked about inhaling the legal high and the dressing - room bust following @entity24			1
‘ it ’s made me a better player and a better person off the field			0
i am more aware of stuff that goes on in and around football , so it ’s made me a much better and stronger person			0
letting fly : @entity46 unleashes the shot that gave @entity29 an early lead at the @entity68 opener : @entity46 ( right ) is joined by team - mates @entity71 ( left ) and @entity72 to celebrate salvaged : @entity49 scored late on to rescue an opening day point for @entity29 ‘ ( @entity24 ) is in the past and everyone has moved on			1
we drew a line under it straight after the game and we ’re all just looking forward to this season			2
’ new @entity5 boss @entity80 has had no issues with @entity4 – who fled war - torn @entity83 aged 10 after his father was killed – and expects him to remain at @entity68 this season			1
‘ i have not had to talk to him about his discipline			0
i was aware of ( his problems ) as they were well documented , ’ said the @entity86 , who swapped @entity88 ’s academy for the @entity90 dugout in june			0
‘ @entity4 has been a model professional			2
what happens in the past , people make some bad decisions at different times , we have all done it			0
‘ but he is a pleasure to work with			0
i hope he does n’t feel the need to pursue a career beyond here			0
he could be a top player			0
he has got so much talent			0
’ ' model professional ' : @entity5 boss @entity80 was full of praise for @entity4 and his performance the respect is mutual , as @entity4 added : ‘ @entity106 might see him ( @entity107 ) as a surprise choice but he ’s a really good coach and from the first day he came in he ’s had us all working together as a unit and he ’s got everyone back to happiness			1
‘ so we are all just working together great and we ’re lucky to have him because he ’s a good man and a good coach			0
’ @entity29 , meanwhile , had new dad @entity49 to thank for rescuing a deserved point five minutes from time			1
the 29 - year - old @entity115 – whose wife gave birth a baby girl last week – climaxed a swift breakaway from close range after debutants @entity121 and @entity123 had combined			2
the @entity29 won four of their final five games to escape the drop last season but @entity49 feels there is renewed optimism under @entity26			1
video second half reaction pleasing - @entity26 good week : @entity49 became the father to a baby girl this week and celebrated accordingly @entity9 hopes : @entity72 , who made his debut for @entity29 , is hoping for an international recall ‘ i ’m pretty confident that we ’re not going to be in trouble this season , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’ve really been looking forward to this season – more than for any other in a long time			0
i just feel that we ’re going places			0
’ @entity26 handed a debut to £ 10million @entity72 – who hopes to win an @entity9 recall this month – but he was subdued and was replaced midway through the second half			2
on this evidence , it is @entity4 who you ’d back for a place in @entity149 ’s @entity9 squad .			2

@entity4 scored twice as @entity5 drew with @entity29
*striker* was filmed inhaling laughing gas last season and was blamed by team - mates for the loss of two points in match with @entity24
now @entity83 - born @entity4 is hoping for an @entity9 call - up
@entity46 gave @entity29 an early lead with stunning goal
but @entity4 set @entity5 on course for *victory* with brace
@entity49 rescued point for @entity29 with five minutes left
