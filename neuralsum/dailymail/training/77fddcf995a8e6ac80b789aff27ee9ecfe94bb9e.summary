by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:49 est , 5 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:13 est , 6 december 2013 amid ongoing protests held by fast - food industry workers demanding higher minimum wages , @entity4 ’s has offered its employees advice on how to properly tip au pairs and personal fitness instructors			1
the out - of - touch tipping guidelines appeared on the site @entity15 , but were deleted this afternoon following backlash			2
the post containing suggestions on how to reward your help during the holiday season came from the etiquette website @entity22			0
dog walkers , personal fitness instructors , barbers and massage therapists were also not to be left out			0
@entity4 's spokeswoman @entity50 justified the tone - deaf tipping guide by telling @entity52 in an email that the content was provided by a third - party partner and included quotes from the @entity22 forum			1
if @entity4 's employees were to follow the online holiday guide , they would have spent up to a thousand dollars this season - a tall order considering that an average fast - food worker earns about $ 9 an hour			1
hired help : according to the guide , it is appropriate to gift your dog walker and au pair one week 's pay during the holiyda season according to the @entity72 @entity71 , the typical fast food staffer made $ 18,130 in 2010			1
the @entity15 site affiliated with @entity4 ’s boasts ‘ practical solutions to many of life ’s problems and challenges			2
this is not the first time that @entity4 's landed in hot water for offering its employees financial advice			1
last month , the employee budget guide published online by the ' @entity15 ' team advised staff to return gifts and eat stale bread if they are struggling to get by on their wages			0
in july , the fast food giant once again came under fire when its financial planning site called @entity95 provided a sample budget that included no money for heat and set aside only $ 600 for rent and $ 20 for health insurance			1
the questionable etiquette post was deleted this afternoon as fast - food workers and labor organizers marched , waved signs and chanted in 100 cities across @entity72 in a concerted push for higher minimum wages			1
organizers say walkouts are planned , with rallies set for another 100 cities			2
but it 's not clear what the actual turnout will be , how many of the participants are workers and what impact they 'll have on restaurant operations			2
the actions would mark the largest showing yet in a push that began a year ago			0
media circus : the ' helpful ' tipping advice was offered to @entity4 's workers amid protests held in 100 @entity72 cities calling for higher wages striking @entity4 's worker @entity128 , 31 , protests outside @entity4 's in @entity130 , @entity131 , today song and dance : fast - foot workers chanted inside a @entity136 's restaurant in @entity137 , pushing to raise the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 at a time when there 's growing national and international attention on economic disparities , labor unions , worker advocacy groups and @entity145 are hoping to build public support to raise the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 , or about $ 15,000 a year for full - time work			1
protesters are calling for pay of $ 15 an hour , but the figure is seen more as a rallying point than a near - term possibility			1
in @entity154 , about 100 protesters blew whistles and beat drums while marching into a @entity4 's at around 6:30 a.m. ; one startled customer grabbed his food and fled as they flooded the restaurant , while another did n't look up from eating and reading amid their chants of ' we ca n't survive on $ 7.25 !

the industry competes aggressively on value offerings and companies have warned that they would need to raise prices if wages were hiked			0
most fast - food locations are also owned and operated by franchisees , which lets companies such as @entity184 , @entity205 and @entity231 say that they do n't control worker pay			2
however , labor advocates have pointed out that companies control many other aspects of restaurant operations through their franchise agreements , including menus , suppliers and equipment			0
fast - food workers have historically been seen as difficult to unionize , given the industry 's high turnover rates			2
