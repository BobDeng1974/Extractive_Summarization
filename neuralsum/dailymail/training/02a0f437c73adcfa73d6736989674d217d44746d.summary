@entity1 is accompanied by her parents @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity11 and her son @entity110 @entity13 syndrome is a rare and incurable genetic disorder that causes severe physical and mental disability			1
affecting about 1 in every 12,000 girls – and only much more rarely seen in boys – it is usually diagnosed in early childhood when infants fail to develop normally or begin losing basic skills they have already learned			2
sufferers can live to the age of 40 but about 95 per cent survive only until they are 25			0
the condition involves a mutation in a specific gene which affects the way the brain develops and prevents other genes from working in the correct way			2
initially symptoms can be vague , but include speech problems and losing the use of the hands			0
some children stop using eye contact and lose interest in toys			0
a period of rapid degeneration follows which can last several months			0
children will usually need round - the - clock care and will be unable to do even the simplest tasks on their own			0
many will be unable to walk , talk or focus and some will develop symptoms not unlike autism			0
a third stage , where symptoms plateau , can then last for many years			0
some will remain in this state for the rest of their lives			0
many will suffer regular seizures and severe motor problems but their condition will not deteriorate			0
there is no cure , and treatment involves managing the symptoms			0
medication may be needed for breathing problems and motor difficulties , and anti-epileptic drugs may be used to control seizures			0
those at risk of dying from the syndrome will usually have experienced severe seizures , swallowing difficulties and greatly reduced mobility			0
other sufferers can die from pneumonia			0
because the condition is so rare – and because the majority of sufferers do not go on to have children – it is not known if it is hereditary			0
however , it is thought the chances of parents having a second child with the condition are about one per cent .			0
