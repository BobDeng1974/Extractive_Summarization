by @entity0 published : 17:40 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 17:40 est , 25 december 2012 we are often told that every snowflake is different - but the naked eye is simply not advanced enough to appreciate the world 's favourite form of precipitation			0
but even without a white @entity7 this year , we are able to fully explore the complexity of the water molecules that make up snowflakes thanks to an @entity12 scientist and his fascination with the white stuff			1
@entity15 , a professor of physics at the @entity17 , has been studying snowflakes , ice patterns , crystal growth and ice formations since 1997			1
using a specially designed photo - microscope called the @entity24 9000 , the 53 - year - old braves subzero temperatures to catch falling snow flakes , photographing them before they melt			1
placing the snowflake underneath the microscope , he illuminates the snowflake with coloured lights			1
unique : professor @entity15 collects snowflakes in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , the @entity38 and the @entity40 mountains fascination : @entity15 , professor of physics at the @entity17 , has been studying snowflakes , ice patterns , crystal growth and ice formations since 1997 sophisticated : the scientist photographs the flakes using a device called the @entity24 9000 , a cross between a microscope and a camera these pictures show real snow crystals that fell to earth in @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , the @entity38 and the @entity40 mountains of @entity56			1
the professor was first inspired to capture snowflakes after realising that they had never been captured in a way that intrigued him			1
he said : ' when i first began toying with the idea of writing a book about snowflakes , i found that there were n't any really nice pictures out there			1
' the state - of - the - art in snowflake photography was not what it could have been			0
' this was an opportunity , so i set out to design and build a photo - microscope that was optimised for taking pictures of snowflakes			1
' mr @entity15 soon found that he would have to overcome a number of challenges to acquire the images he desired			1
' there are a number of challenges in photographing snowflakes			1
the crystals are small , so the usual techniques of macro photography do n't work well ; what you need is essentially a high - quality , low - power microscope			2
equipment : the @entity91 9000 , built by mr @entity15 , features a microscope and a @entity94 camera within a heated enclosure ' in addition , the equipment must be robust enough to work outside , and it has to withstand sub-freezing temperatures			1
finally , to take good pictures , you have to take a lot of pictures			2
therefore , i wanted my hardware to be easy to set up and use			0
' @entity106 flakes form when a cloud droplet first freezes into a tiny particle of ice			2
as water vapour starts condensing on its surface , the ice particle quickly develops facets , which form into different shaped snowflakes depending on temperature			1
whilst scientists differ on the classifications of snowflakes , the scientist has identified 35 different types of formations			1
these include @entity122 , plate - like snow crystals that have branches and sidebranches , which are typically 2 - 4 mm in diameter			0
stellar plates or ' common snowflakes ' are thin , plate - like crystals with six broad arms that form a star - like shape , forming when the temperature is near -2 @entity134 ) or near -15 @entity135 )			2
others like @entity137 are the largest snow crystals , often falling to earth with diameters of 5mm or more			0
building the specially designed @entity24 9000 , a microscope and @entity94 digital camera contained in a heated enclosure , mr @entity15 was able to get the desired results			1
dedication : after studying snowflakes for 14 years the scientist has identified 35 different types of snowflake formation colour : to highlight the snowflake 's dimensions and qualities , mr @entity15 uses illumination techniques from a variety of colour filters for different effects ' the camera itself is housed in a heated enclosure , white styrofoam box , so that it can stay outside in the cold indefinitely , ' he explains			1
' the snowflake is placed on a platform attached to a translation stage for focusing			0
' as is typical for microscopes , it is more convenient to move the subject than to move the lens			0
i attached a flexible shaft and a large knob to the stage , making it easier to focus with cold fingers			0
' to highlight the snowflake 's dimensions and qualities , mr @entity15 uses illumination techniques from a variety of colour filters for different effects			1
' @entity106 crystals are made of ice , which is clear and colourless			2
i like to illuminate the crystals with coloured lights from behind , using the optical layout shown above			0
' the snow crystal then acts like a complex lens that refracts the different colours in different directions , producing a variety of colourful effects			2
' to illuminate the crystals , i use a lamp mounted below them			0
above the lamp is a heat - rejection filter and a piece of ground glass and on top of those components i can place any of a number of colour filters			0
the field lens focuses the colour filter onto the microscope objective			2
' @entity15 's amazing images have allowed him to further his study of of crystal formations and apply them to a number of industries - particularly manufacturing			1
precision : he has to take lots of photographs before finding one that works effectively further use : as well as providing beautiful images , the scientist says his work helps understand the ' structure formation and ' self - assembly ' qualities in snowflakes unique : speaking of each snowflake 's distinction , he said : ' there is no blueprint or genetic code that guides the growth of a snowflake ' ' there are several good reasons for studying how snowflakes form			1
first of all , crystals are useful in all sorts of applications , and we would like to know how to grow them better			0
by studying the physics of snowflakes , we learn about how molecules condense to form crystals			2
' another good reason to study snowflakes is to better understand structure formation and self - assembly			2
the snowflake is an very simple example of self - assembly			0
' there is no blueprint or genetic code that guides the growth of a snowflake , yet marvellously complex structures appear , quite literally out of thin air			2
' as we understand better how snowflakes form , we learn about self - assembly			0
as the electronics industry pushes toward ever smaller devices , it is likely that self - assembly will play an increasingly important role in manufacturing			0
' but the scientist says that his study of snowflakes is the pursuit of understanding basic science			1
' my personal motivation is not from potential practical applications			0
i am not trying to make better artificial snow , better ice for @entity278 skating , bigger diamonds , faster computers , or anything like that , ' he said			0
' i want to figure out the underlying physics of snowflake growth because this is an interesting puzzle in molecular dynamics			0
i would like to understand the fundamental physics of how molecules jostle into place to form a crystal			0
' how fast does this happen ? how does it change with temperature ? what happens if there are chemical impurities on the ice surface ? these remarkable structures simply fall from the sky - we ought to understand how they are formed			0

professor @entity15 studied snowflakes , ice patterns , crystal growth and ice formations since 1997
the scientist uses a microscope and camera within a heated *chamber* to take pictures called the @entity312 9000
