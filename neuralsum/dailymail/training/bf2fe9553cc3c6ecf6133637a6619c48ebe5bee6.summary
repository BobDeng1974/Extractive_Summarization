an extraordinary @entity1 row has broken out over plans by ministers to force @entity5 schools to teach pupils about @entity7			1
the move by education secretary @entity9 is intended to stop @entity11 extremists from ‘ brainwashing ’ children			1
but it has led to a clash at the top of @entity17 , with home secretary @entity18 lining up with mrs @entity19 against communities secretary @entity20			1
mrs @entity19 drew up the proposals in the wake of the ‘ @entity32 ’ plot by radical @entity11 to take over schools in @entity25 , which led to the government rushing in new measures to compel schools to teach ‘ @entity30 values ’ of tolerance			1
@entity9 , is said to have drawn up the new proposals in the wake of the @entity32 plot in @entity25 schools however , @entity35 has learned that the plan has infuriated mr @entity20 , who has argued it ‘ violates religious freedom ’ , and warned about the impact on @entity41 and @entity42 schools			1
the education secretary wants to amend the @entity45 course , which stipulates that pupils should study one ‘ world religion ’ – usually restricted to their school ’s faith			0
mrs @entity19 wants students to learn about a minimum of two religions to ensure that @entity5 pupils become aware of ‘ different perspectives ’			0
mr @entity20 – backed by the heads of the @entity41 and @entity42 faiths in the @entity30 – has pointed out that the plan could also compel other faith schools to teach pupils about @entity11			1
a government source said : ‘ @entity20 has really gone off on one over this			2
home secretary @entity18 , left , is supporting the plans , while communities secretary @entity20 , is against ‘ he thinks that it is just meddling , and it will have a knock - on effect on the freedom of @entity41 and @entity42 schools to restrict their teachings to just their faith and preserve their distinctive ethos			1
@entity18 however has been fully supportive			2
she thinks the most important thing is to stop a new generation of @entity11 from being lost to the extremists			2
’ the chief rabbi @entity76 is expected to raise the proposal at a meeting with the prime minister later this month			0
the catholic archbishop of @entity81 , the @entity82 , is also understood to have privately expressed his concerns over the reform , while the archbishop of @entity86 , @entity87 , is ‘ broadly supportive ’ of the move			0
last night an ally of mrs @entity19 defended the plan as essential to stop the radicalisation of children			0
the source said : ‘ we saw in @entity25 the dangers of allowing schools to inculcate an intolerant and @entity98 version of their faith in young and impressionable pupils			0
‘ if they are obliged to learn about another religion – in an even - handed manner – it will help to stop them from being brainwashed			0
’ the chief rabbi and the archbishop of @entity81 declined to comment last night .			0
