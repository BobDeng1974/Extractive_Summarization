by @entity0 published : 05:08 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 15:50 est , 22 august 2012 the body of a diver missing for more than a decade has been found in the cold waters of @entity5 , where he drowned after he saved his friend 's life			1
@entity9 of @entity10 , @entity11 , disappeared in september 1999 while exploring a popular and extremely dangerous shipwreck , the legendary @entity13 , 225ft below the surface with his trusted diving partner @entity15 before tragedy struck			1
after mr @entity15 's air supply was depleted at the bottom of the lake , there was a frantic fight for survival as the two men shared a single tank , alternating breathes and desperately clinging to their diving line as they ascended toward the surface			1
mr @entity9 never made it and the 52 - year - old 's remains were found in @entity30 on saturday , the @entity31 confirmed , still in his dive suit and with air tanks connected to him			1
he is pictured at right beside his daughter @entity38 tragedy : the 52 - year - old 's remains were found in @entity30 on saturday near the @entity13 , pictured , an iron steamer loaded with new cars lost off @entity43 in 1924 ' he still had his diving gear on , in fact , ' sheriff @entity44 said			1
sheriff @entity47 said that two experienced divers found the remains while also exploring the wreck of a boat called the @entity13			1
@entity52 , the wife of mr @entity9 , spoke exclusively to the @entity53 about the news of her husband 's discovery			1
she said that ' of course ' the news was a great relief to the family , adding that they did not plan any memorial or service to commemorate mr @entity9			1
@entity64 , she told the @entity53 that she was having difficulty speaking about it			0
officials say mr @entity9 disappeared while diving with friends on september 4 , 1999 and was last seen by his dive partner , @entity15 , a 49 - year - old man from nearby @entity69			1
police reports from the incident show that mr @entity15 , mr @entity9 and their friend @entity73 were on a diving trip on mr @entity15 's ship named the @entity76			1
all three men were close friends and diving companions for more than a decade			2
they told police that the three of them had been visiting the @entity13 for more than five years and explored it more than 20 times together			1
using a permanent line connecting the @entity76 with the @entity13 , mr @entity15 and mr @entity9 proceeded to head down for a photographic expedition of the wreck they had come to know over the years			1
mr @entity73 had planned on joining his friends , but was delayed and stayed behind			2
both divers had three air supplies : a primary regulator , a secondary regulator or ' octopus ' and a pony bottle			2
mystery : mr @entity9 was a celebrated businessman and inventor before he disappeared ' they knew what they were doing and they had the equipment to do it , ' an officer wrote in his report			1
the descent to the wreck was ' uneventful , ' mr @entity103 told police			0
the pair toured the bow of the ship and visited the part where the ship was broken in half			0
the two of them were making their way back to the mooring line when mr @entity103 's air regulator began to ' free flow			2
' when air regulators free flow , or freeze up , during dives , the tanks deliver air constantly , causing a diver 's air supply to be depleted in a matter of minutes			1
mr @entity15 signaled mr @entity9 for help , but mr @entity9 accidentally turned off mr @entity15 's secondary air supply , leaving mr @entity15 's primary air supply to deplete entirely			1
a frantic mr @entity15 hooked himself up to his smallest container of air and the two men headed toward the surface			1
' both divers now had an emergency situation and they aborted their dive and made a hard swim for the bow of the @entity13 to the ascent line , ' the police report reads			2
the two grabbed hold of the line facing each other and made their way toward the surface hand - over - hand			0
search : two experienced divers found the remains while also exploring the wreck @entity13 three - quarters of the way up , mr @entity15 's tank was empty			1
mr @entity9 gave him his own secondary air supply and the two men continued upward			1
the situation under control , mr @entity9 went to release the stringer line because , according to mr @entity15 ' they had beat the dive			1
' a moment later , mr @entity9 was in trouble			1
the @entity13 was a 2,425 - ton iron steamer built by the @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity162 , in 1887 as the @entity163			2
she was renamed the @entity13 on may 24 , 1910 , according to the @entity165			2
on december 3 , 1924 , after departing @entity43 , she began taking on water and sank in 210 feet of water six miles east of the canal entrance with a cargo of @entity170 , @entity171 , and @entity173 automobiles			0
today , she lies upright and largely intact with many of her automobiles intact in her hold			0
experienced divers flock to the wreck site to explore the vessel , though it is considered a highly technical and dangerous dive			2
' when @entity15 turned around , @entity9 was right on him			2
@entity15 stated @entity9 did not have his regulator in his mouth ... @entity9 was bumping into his chest , chest - to - chest , eyeball - to - eyeball , ' the report read			2
' @entity9 's eyes were wide and big			2
' mr @entity15 gave mr @entity9 his own air supply and the two began to ' buddy breath ' back and forth , but eventually , mr @entity9 became completely incapacitated			1
' he was like fading away , ' the report said			0
mr @entity15 said he had two options at this point			2
completely out of air and holding his breath , he could rip the regulator out of his friend 's mouth and continue his own ascent , or leave his friend with the air and make his way toward the surface			0
he chose the second option			0
on his way up , he kept looking back for mr @entity205 , hoping he would appear behind him , but he never came up			0
bottles for decompression and emergency air , tied to the point in the line where mr @entity9 was last seen , were all that remained of him			1
mr @entity73 and mr @entity15 said that there was till 2,600 psi , out of a possible 3,000 psi in the tanks			1
they continued to search for their friend until the @entity217 arrived			0
the @entity217 and local law enforcement mounted an exhaustive search of the area following his disappearance , utilizing a helicopter , 41 - foot patrol boat and numerous fishing vessels to assist			0
once the interview was completed , the two men asked for permission to return to the water to find their missing friend and to tell their wives of the incident			0
two days later , the search was called off , having only located mr @entity9 's wallet , his open water diver certification and his wreck diver certification			1
' there was a death investigation , i would n't call it a homicide investigation , ' @entity47 said to the @entity53			0
' there were no suspicious circumstances			0
' the sheriff added that a few years ago , mr @entity9 's body was found by a local fisherman			1
' six , seven years ago he was snagged by a fisherman , but he was released , ' he said			0
' somehow they lost the snag			0
we did another search for the body but could n't find him			0
' sheriff @entity47 said that each time , his office notifies the @entity9 family of the body 's appearance			2
mr @entity9 was a celebrated businessman and inventor before he passed			1
he founded a recumbent bicycle company , @entity257 in @entity11 during the 1980s			0
he also ran @entity258 , which was founded by his father , which manufactures garbage trucks , marine boats and barges			0
his son and daughter both still work at the family company			0
mummy : mr @entity9 was found perfectly intact , more than a decade after his disappearance ' we made numerous attempts through the years to try to recover him with technological advancements , ' @entity47 said			1
' we used some of that to go down there , but his remains were n't found until saturday			0
' authorities say mr @entity9 's body was recovered near the wreck which sits about seven miles east of the @entity43 canal in more than 200ft of water			1
it 's unique because the original cargo of early 20th century cars is still visible			0
that makes it a popular diving destination , but only for experienced divers			0
' that particular shipwreck is what we call a technical dive , ' explained diver and owner of @entity295			0
' when it 's so deep , you need much more training to go down there than a normal sport diver would			0
' mr @entity301 told @entity302 that the water temperature at that depth is around @entity305 ( @entity306 )			0
he said the conditions would preserve a body for a long time			0
' because of the pressure and the depth it 's at , there 's not a long of oxygen down there , ' mr @entity301 said			0
' plus the cold , it 's like a refrigerator , it 'll keep for quite a while			0
' the sheriff 's department did not release the exact condition of the body , but reports show that mr @entity9 was identified in part by the fact that he had two fingers amputated			1
a flashlight with the name ' @entity9 ' was also found on his person .			2
