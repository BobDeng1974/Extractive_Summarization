the blast destroyed a @entity90 van , killing 12 officers and wounding 51 people but @entity4 law meant that the maximum he could serve in jail was 30 years and his sentence was commuted			1
at the time the term was reduced the law also meant he was entitled to be released on remission and they let him walk free after 24 years			1
