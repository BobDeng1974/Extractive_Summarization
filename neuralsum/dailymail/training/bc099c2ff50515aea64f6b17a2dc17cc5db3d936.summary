' there 's a hunger there to keep playing			0
he 's 36 and he 's had a great career			0
' we think there might still be a bit of mileage in him yet and if there is we will try and make the most of that			0
' if you look at his career , he 's won a lot of things in the game and he 's played for his country over 60 times now ; that 's quality and you do n't lose the quality			0
' you lose the legs a little bit but he was always a fantastic athlete as well			0
at 36 i still think there might be plenty left in there if he has the right attitude and hunger to keep going			0
' i 'm really pleased to see the career he went on to have at @entity38 , @entity47 , @entity41 and obviously @entity77			0
