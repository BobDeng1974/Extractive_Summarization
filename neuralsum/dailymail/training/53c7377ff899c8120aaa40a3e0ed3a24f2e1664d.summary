' @entity26 has n’t really done a lot in the past two years to prove to the world that they do n’t tolerate rape culture and allowing a @entity31 registered sex offender on the team pretty much solidifies the assumption that they are concerned about wins rather than the safety of young girls or the destruction of rape culture in their area , ' she added			1
