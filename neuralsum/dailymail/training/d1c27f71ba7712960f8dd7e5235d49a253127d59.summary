@entity7 , 18 , was working on self - defence moves when he was thrown backwards onto the floor			1
his car keys , which had been tucked in his pocket , fell out and the teenager slammed on top on the upturned point before landing			2
@entity7 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , was taken to hospital where it took doctors seven hours to safely remove the keys			1
an x-ray of his left foot shows the key was wedged into his sole but luckily did not cause any damage to the bones or nerves			0
but the black belt did need to use crutches for two afterwards			1
he told @entity48 : ' my foot slammed it before it fell over			0
the chances were one in a million			0
ouch : @entity7 was taken to hospital where it took doctors seven hours to remove the lodged keys lodged : an x-ray shows how far the keys penetrated his foot but did not damage the bones or nerves ' they took x-rays to make sure it did not fracture a bone or any nerves			1
' video of the accident shows the keys dangling from his gi before he hits the ground			2
he and his partner are shown laughing and joking before the accident			0
it is even more unfortunate as it was @entity7 's last day at the club			0
positive : despite the pain the teenager was able to smile and he was only on crutches for two weeks			0
