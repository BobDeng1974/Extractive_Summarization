he followed the group of four during the grueling race all terrains : despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of @entity11 , primarily for his own safety , he refused to go			2
it meant when he got stuck in the knee - deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted , they stopped to take a break support : at one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle , so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food @entity11 first met @entity13 in november , as his team were sitting down for a meal that would fuel them through a dangerous 20 - mile trek through the @entity19 rainforest			1
as he opened his can of meat , a tired @entity13 noticed @entity11 , then a scruffy , miserable stray dog , staring at him out of the corner of his eye			1
feeling sorry for him , he fed @entity106 a meatball and thought nothing of it , but as the team stood up to continue their race the animal started to follow them - and he did n't stop			2

he fed @entity11 one thinking nothing on it , but ended up creating a bond with the dog even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety - he refused to leave			1
this meant when he was tired they stopped for a break and when he got stuck in the mud they pulled him out			0
after six days the team finished the race , and the dog had suffered			0
they therefore decided to take him to a vet while still in @entity160 to have him checked out			0
during that time @entity13 thought to himself that after their experience , they could not leave @entity11 , so he decided to adopt him and take him back to @entity3			1
