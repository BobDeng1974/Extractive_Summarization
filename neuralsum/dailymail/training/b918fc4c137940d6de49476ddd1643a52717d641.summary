super-tall @entity1 hopeful @entity0 is having the last laugh on school bullies who made cruel jibes about her height			1
classmates would risk a kicking now if they still teased 6ft 2ins @entity0 over her stature			1
university graduate @entity0 , 21 , has mixed brawn , brains and beauty to become one of @entity15 's best exponents of the ancient korean martial art of taekwondo			1
however , the @entity30 - based fighter will be seeing less of the catwalk and more of the world 's taekwondo mats as she chases her @entity35 dream for the next 18 months			1
after just four months as a full - time member of the @entity37 on @entity38 in @entity28 , she has been selected for next weekend 's prestigious @entity39 in the city , featuring 256 of the planet 's best in the sport			1
@entity0 said : ' it was hard at school and i used to get bullied a few times for being tall and skinny			1
' that 's one of the reasons i got into taekwondo , because my dad thought it would be a good idea to learn how to defend myself			2
standing tall at 6ft 2ins has also helped @entity0 to be scouted for a local modelling agency ' a friend of my dad 's friends did it and one day i bumped in to him and he had his taekwondo suit ( dobok ) on			1
' i was like " dad , what is he doing ? why he is he wearing that suit ? " ' @entity62 just said he does taekwondo , like the @entity65 films			2
' i just wanted to have a go straight away and i loved it			0
' @entity0 , who became national champion in @entity28 last month , took up the sport aged nine			2
a few years later , she added another string to her bow - modelling			0
@entity0 has modeled for @entity72 , the clothing website and other fashion shows she said : ' i began modelling when i was 11 , sending photos to agencies , but it was n't until i was about 16 when things started to roll			2
' i got asked to do modelling for @entity72 , the clothing website , and other fashion shows			0
' i am signed up to @entity27 but i want to focus on my taekwondo as the castings are usually during the week when i have training			0
' last year she entered her first beauty pageants , reaching the final of miss @entity87 and the grand final of @entity26			1
she said : ' i started modelling to boost my confidence and prove people wrong			0
hopefully , i am doing that now			0
' @entity0 is hoping to represent @entity15 in taekwondo at @entity94 @entity0 had just completed a three - year sports science degree at @entity96 when the call came for her to move to @entity28 to join the @entity37			1
she said : ' i was excited and surprised when i was told because i thought i was too old - most of the girls are 18 or 19			0
' i did have trials when i was 16 , but the last stage and boot camp were on at the same time as my exams			0
' i did my exams instead and did n't think i would get another chance to prove myself , but i am here now			0
' i 've finished my studies and while i still have my modelling to fall back on , my main goal is taekwondo and trying to focus on @entity94			0
