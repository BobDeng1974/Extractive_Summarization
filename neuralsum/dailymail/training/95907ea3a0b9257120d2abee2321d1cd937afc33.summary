a baker claims she has cooked the world 's biggest mince pie after it weighed in at two stone and containing 56,140 calories - 22 times the recommended daily calorie intake for a man			1
@entity7 , 40 , of @entity9 's bakery in @entity10 , near @entity11 , @entity12 , created the festive favourite using 12.5kg of mincemeat and 1.5kg of sweet pastry			1
she designed a custom - made reinforced steel tray to produce the pie , which measured a monstrous 27 - inches - the same size as a typical four by four tyre			1
@entity7 pictured with the finished product that was 27 - inches in diameter , the same size as a typical four - by - four tyre a baker laying out the 1.5kg of traditional sweet pastry in the custom - made reinforced steel tray @entity28 said : ' it is 27 inches which is massive and probably about the equivalent of a large tyre			1
it took about an hour to cook - it normally takes 23 minutes			2
' we think we have we have made the world 's biggest mince pie that actually looks like a mince pie			1
' it has got the star cut out on top too just as we would with our normal sized pies - only difference is this 100 times bigger			0
' the giant pie had to be transported around the bakery from machine to machine by six people due to its size			1
the mincemeat filling alone weighed in at 12.5 kg , just shy of two stone and the traditional sweet pastry , a family recipe of @entity28 's , added another 1.5kg			1
one of the largest mince pies ever made was an 18 - feet - long pie , baked in three separate tins , at @entity59 , in 2007 , in an rectangular shape			2
however , @entity28 and her bakers were able to make a giant version that looks more like the traditional circular mince pie			1
the finished product was a 27 - inch diameter mine pie - the same size as a typical 4x4 tyre			1
six people were needed to carry it around the bakery because of its size			2
the mincemeat filling weighs 12.5kg , just shy of two stone			2
normal pies contain just 30g of mincemeat			0
the traditional sweet pastry was 1.5kg the pie contains a massive 56,140 calories to do this @entity28 had to have a reinforced custom - made steel tray designed to hold the pie and this was then covered with foil to ensure it retained its shape			1
@entity28 said : ' we had a local steel manufacturing company make us the tin			0
we could n't find foil big enough to hold or cover the pie			0
so we used this steel tin to replicated the foil and hold it in place			0
it was just far too heavy for foil			0
so we worked with the local business to achieve this			0
' once @entity28 had the tin made , it was foiled and then lined with silicon grease proof paper before the 1.5kg of pastry were rolled out using a commercial rolling pin called a pastry brake machine			2
she added : ' it was then rolled over the pin , although it was rather heavy , and then carefully put inside the tin			0
because it was so big we had to do it with the pastry brake			0
' the bakers then put 12.5 kg of mincemeat inside the pastry case and cut by hand a 27 inch lid of pastry in the shape of a star and carefully slid it atop the pie			2
a total of six bakers were needed to move the massive mince pie around the kitchen in @entity10 , near @entity11 , @entity12 @entity124 said the only difference between the record breaking pie and their traditional festive favourite is the size , ' it is 100 times bigger , ' she said normal sized mince pies usually contain just 30 grams of mincemeat			1
@entity28 said : ' we had to cut the lid on a box because we could n't transport it easily			0
' the scariest bit was probably waiting to find out that we had cooked it enough and that it did n't have a soggy bottom ! ' however the pie is n't just for decoration , @entity9 's bakery will be donating to the pie to their local @entity144 who have been working with the @entity147 team			1
she said : ' we are donating it for a good cause			0
i do n't know if they will be auctioning it off to the rugby players or putting on a charity event to see how much these rugby players can eat of it - we know they have high calorie diets but i am not sure if they could stomach 60,000			0
or maybe everyone at the hospice will get to eat it			0
' she added : ' we wanted to do something fun for the run up to @entity166 - everyone loves a mince			2
we sell four for Â£ 2.85			0
but we thought , how about a giant mince pie ! we also wanted to do something good for a local charity ! '			1
