by @entity0 this is the @entity2 , where @entity3 delivers the very latest news , gossip and rumours from around the football world three times a week			0
in today 's column , @entity10 weighs up a selection of strikers , @entity9 look at @entity14			1
@entity10 's protestations that @entity16 would not sign a striker in january have been falling on deaf ears around @entity19			2
@entity10 and his scouting team have been busy since october weighing up potential targets and the same names remain at the forefront of his thinking : @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
@entity31 moves : @entity10 is planning a big move for a striker , with @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) touted goal scorer : @entity26 joined @entity35 in the summer but could already be on his way out tuesday 's defeat to @entity38 underlined @entity10 's summer assessment of his squad that they needed more ammunition to dominate at the top level			1
a deal for @entity45 striker @entity25 was his ideal but the state of that deal remains the same - @entity9 wo n't sell			1
the others though are all achievable in january , albeit at a premium price			0
@entity35 have insisted @entity26 is not for sale but the player , watched personally by @entity10 in november , is keen to move to a more competitive competition			2
he was bought for £ 50million and @entity35 would want a profit			0
@entity27 is also interested in a move to the @entity56			2
life with @entity58 is fine , even in the shadow of @entity60 , but again the @entity56 or @entity61 is the ideal destination			0
@entity9 like @entity27 too and a deal in january for either them or @entity16 would need to hit the £ 54.3million mark that @entity58 paid to @entity65 in august			1
@entity16 discussed and bid for @entity28 in the summer , offering around £ 34m to take him from @entity68 and the @entity69 has again asked to leave this week			1
@entity9 watched @entity28 , among others , against @entity71 on december 11 but @entity16 have a good relationship with @entity68			1
a similar bid in january could be enough			0
funds : @entity75 need to raise funds again , and @entity29 could be out the door incredible : @entity28 was a @entity16 target in the summer and the striker asked to leave @entity68 this week @entity75 's @entity29 came on as a substitute for @entity82 teammate @entity26 in the game @entity10 attended against @entity84 in november			1
his club @entity75 need to raise funds again following their exit from the @entity89 , they want £ 35million for a 27 - year - old who @entity91 considered three years ago when @entity29 was playing for @entity92 in @entity93			1
the question is whether he is good enough quality			0
he has scored 13 goals in 19 games for @entity75 this season but only one came in the @entity89 - the 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity102			2
perhaps , purely coincidentally , @entity103 striker @entity30 also played in the international @entity10 attended in november			0
the @entity103 man has struggled this season after exploding on to the @entity56 scene and has been criticised by the likes of @entity107 for not working hard enough			0
however , some would argue he has n't had the service and would profit alongside better players			0
@entity103 would be vulnerable to offers around £ 30million			0
@entity16 home improvements are not just focused on attack , meanwhile , as they look to add a defender and a midfielder			2
as reported by @entity118 , @entity117 's agent has confirmed that @entity16 have held talks about signing his client from @entity121 and explained the two clubs are working on an agreement			1
however , @entity124 , @entity117 's agent , told @entity125 that it was n't done and dusted just yet			2
he said : ' i 'm currently in @entity121 and i can confirm that @entity16 want to sign @entity117			1
nearly there : midfielder @entity117 could be on his way to @entity129 in january flying high : @entity16 are hoping to complete a move for @entity132 defender @entity131 now the @entity133 are talking with @entity121 to try to find an agreement			1
only after that we will speak about @entity117 's situation			2
a few days ago we also went to @entity138 with @entity121 officials to talk to @entity16			1
now we need to know what the sporting project is at @entity16 because we are not rushing into anything , we do n't just accept any team that come forward			2
' @entity117 is happy at @entity121 and he just wants to make the secure choice			1
' the next target will be for @entity16 to wrap up a deal for @entity132 centre - back @entity131			2
the young @entity149 defender is serving a ten match ban after being sent off against @entity151 but @entity16 are close to agreeing a deal for around £ 12million ahead of competition from @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity9			1
@entity9 are taking a close look at highly - rated @entity157 defender @entity14			1
@entity14 , who turned 17 last thursday on december 12 , is at @entity158 with @entity9 's @entity160 squad in the hope of impressing staff and securing a deal			1
@entity9 face competition from @entity165 and @entity121 who are also keen to take a look at the 6ft 3ins teenager			1
despite his tender years , @entity14 has played 17 first team games this season for his club @entity173 and has already been called up to the @entity175 national squad			2
@entity14 is a stylish centre - back who is strong in the air , he has represented his country at @entity181 level up to the @entity182 where he has been capped five times and scored one goal			2
potential : @entity14 ( right ) is being looked at by @entity9 as a future prospect @entity9 are determined to improve the calibre of youngsters coming through their ranks and want to step up recruitment from abroad			1
scouts have also been in @entity191 recently to watch some of their young stars from the @entity193			0
ironically , @entity191 international and @entity197 centre - back @entity194 is another player who has been added to @entity199 's lengthy scouting list ahead of january			0
born in @entity132 , the 26 - year - old friend of @entity155 's @entity201 , joined @entity197 from @entity202 last summer for £ 12million			1
@entity204 ' young goalkeeper @entity203 is drawing in the scouts from south of the border			0
@entity9 , @entity155 and @entity38 are all chasing the 14 - year - old starlet who has already trained with @entity204 ' first team			1
@entity203 was outstanding in the @entity209 for @entity210 , and has impressed scouts with a string of top performances			0
@entity214 are considering a move for @entity38 striker @entity216 as they face up to the possibility of losing @entity218 back to @entity9 after @entity219			2
@entity216 is available and has been on loan at @entity221 but a few @entity223 clubs , including @entity224 and @entity225 , are weighing up offers			0
@entity227 : @entity214 are considering a move for @entity38 striker @entity216 , currently on loan at @entity221 @entity214 's budget may help give the advantage to @entity232 who spoke to @entity9 last week about trying to keep @entity218			2
manager @entity199 rates @entity218 and would prefer to see him step up a level to see how he handles the @entity56			0
@entity234 and @entity235 would certainly be interested in the 19 - year - old although the latter may depend on whether @entity238 stays			1
@entity234 , meanwhile , are maintaining a watching brief on @entity214 goalkeeper @entity240 as he returns to fitness			0
they have also held discussions about a possible deal for @entity246 defender @entity245 , as have @entity247			0
@entity245 , 24 , formerly of @entity248 , confirmed : ' there is strong interest and we have begun negotiations with @entity247 and @entity234			0
' @entity154 will send scouts to watch @entity254 this week but face a difficult task to prise the 25 - year - old away in january			1
@entity91 failed with an offer for @entity254 last summer and will be interested to see how matters unfold this window with @entity9 also among the strikers admirers			1
@entity102 re-negotiated his contract , doubled his wages and have a £ 32m buy - out clause which could easily be met but the @entity266 side will more likely deal in the summer			2
catching the eye : @entity154 are scouting @entity102 striker @entity254 , who has a £ 32million buy - out clause @entity270 , who are scouting in @entity132 at @entity272 and @entity273 today , are very keen on @entity275 striker @entity274			1
the @entity276 international has been linked with @entity91 but they have reservations amid their ongoing negotiations with @entity280 at @entity281 and new contract talks for @entity283			0
the 25 - year - old has scored 21 goals in all competitions this season and is keen to move to @entity45 despite the tantalising prospect of facing @entity9 in the @entity89			1
@entity276 's economy means a deal can be struck at a reasonable price			0
@entity292 have signed @entity294 's 16 - year - old midfielder @entity293 on a two year deal			1
@entity91 's latest wing prospect @entity297 has signed his first professional contract with the club			0
the @entity301 - born teenager is widely tipped to make it at the top			0
@entity224 are stepping up their bid to bring @entity305 back to @entity306 but face competition from @entity308			0
@entity311 side @entity309 , who are battling to keep hold of winger @entity314 , are among those interested in @entity316 , 26 , who has battled back to fitness following a cruciate ligament injury last season			0
return ? @entity305 moved to @entity321 in 2011 , and has scored 10 goals in 53 games @entity325 manager @entity324 may look , unsurprisingly to the @entity327 market next month for some quick recruits			0
midfielder @entity329 and forward @entity330 at @entity202 are both runoured to be following @entity324 to @entity332			0
japan international midfielder @entity333 is training with @entity334 this week			0
the 24 - year - old plays with @entity336 in the @entity337			1
@entity65 are preparing for the departure of loanee @entity339 by scouring @entity19 for alternatives			2
@entity270 's @entity342 , @entity344 's @entity343 and @entity16 's @entity345 are all possibles on their wishlist should @entity339 opt to join @entity348 instead once his loan from @entity350 has finished			1
@entity351 are looking to agree a £ 1million deal with @entity354 side @entity353 for @entity355 next month			0
the 24 - year - old was a target for @entity358 in the summer but has struggled to hit form at @entity351 this season and @entity361 is not averse to raising funds to strengthen his squad elsewhere			1
one familiar name attracting interest already at @entity351 is young 15 - year - old goalkeeper @entity366 , son of @entity367			1
cash in : @entity351 are looking to raise funds from the sale of @entity355 ( left ) , who has hit form this month he starred for @entity351 in their penalty shoot - out exit to @entity374 in the @entity375 and caught the attention of scouts in attendance			2
@entity351 coach @entity379 said : ' @entity366 is still 15 years of age			0
it was an unbelievable experience for him to play at the @entity382 for 120 minutes and then face a shootout			0
he came back in disappointed he had n’t saved any penalties and that says a lot about his character			0

@entity16 striker hit list includes @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29
@entity391 also close to signing @entity117 from @entity121
@entity9 set to look at @entity157 17 - year - old defender @entity14
@entity154 scouts watch @entity102 hitman @entity254
@entity65 could chase @entity342 , @entity343 or @entity345 to replace @entity339
