@entity0 has brought @entity1 crashing back down to earth with a warning he must improve his work rate to become a success at @entity6			1
@entity8 's manager yesterday clarified the controversy around @entity1 's spot - kick against @entity11 , insisting the @entity13 striker was justified in taking the responsibility off @entity15 as he is no 2 penalty taker to @entity17 , who was not on the pitch			1
@entity0 was unhappy with the bickering that took place after the penalty had been awarded but of far greater concern to him was the way @entity1 played after he had given @entity8 a lead to take to @entity26			1
@entity27 striker @entity1 joined @entity8 from @entity28 last summer for a £ 16 million fee @entity0 insists that @entity1 must improve his work - rate if he is to be a success at @entity6 @entity1 has scored just four goals in 22 games for @entity8 so far this season the 24 - year - old has garnered a reputation throughout his career for poor discipline and attitude this was the former @entity41 player 's third big contribution in 10 days , following his goal against @entity43 that secured three points and a free - kick that created @entity47 's winner at @entity48			1
but @entity0 is still looking for much more from his £ 16 million summer signing			1
@entity1 has been the subject of public criticism from @entity0 before , notably on @entity52 when he explained that the 24 - year - old 's qualities did not fit @entity8 's system			1
when asked if he had been happy with @entity1 's cameo against @entity11 , @entity0 replied : ' no. not really			1
no. we need to ensure that we have everyone working as a team and once we got the penalty he stops working			2
' he needs to improve on that facet of his game — to play in his position rather than standing on the side of the football field			0
he has got the penalty and scored the goal but that is what he is paid to do			0
' so he needs to keep that efficiency in his game and show that he can affect the team whether he is asked to play from the bench or from the start			0
if he works harder than when he came on , he will ( become an influence )			0
' @entity1 insists to @entity8 captain @entity15 that he should take the penalty against @entity11 when all is said and done though , @entity1 does have a very good penalty taking record @entity8 beat @entity11 1 - 0 in the first - leg of their @entity79 round of 32 tie on thursday one of the main qualities @entity0 looks for in a forward is an ability to relentlessly press and put opponents on the back foot			1
' in a different country and a different style of football ( scoring goals ) would be all that matters , ' said @entity0			2
' but in this team it is more than that			0
' @entity1 was roundly condemned for his behaviour before thursday night 's winning spot - kick and former @entity8 midfielder and @entity98 columnist @entity97 believes the @entity99 is coming to the end of his time at @entity6			1
he said : ' the problem with @entity1 is i do n't think he has got a lot of respect for anybody			2
' he has worked with some of the best managers in @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 — everybody has tried with this man but nobody seems to get to the bottom of it			0
' the objective is to put the ball into the back of the net , thankfully that is what he did , but it is not nice to see players arguing like that on the field			0
' he is an incredibly confident penalty taker and very good at it , but it is that lack of respect that he has			0
' @entity1 has been prone to high - profile controversies at all of his former clubs explaining the penalty situation , @entity0 continued : ' @entity17 and @entity1 are the top two penalty takers , but neither of them were on the pitch at the start so @entity15 was nominated			1
' but when we had a penalty @entity1 had come on to the field so @entity15 , being someone with responsibility and trust , gave the penalty to @entity1 so there was no issue			1
there was a little bit of a kerfuffle around it because he wanted to make sure @entity1 was happy to take it , but that was it really			2
' if you are the vice-captain and the captain is on the bench and then he comes on , it is the etiquette to give him the armband			0
it is a similar thing with the penalty			0
' @entity1 has scored nearly 30 penalties in big games and he is an outstanding penalty taker			2
@entity15 was happy enough to take it , but he gave it to @entity163			0
' @entity0 , whose side travel to @entity167 tomorrow , stressed that no decision has been made about whether @entity15 will take over the captaincy when @entity17 eventually moves to @entity170			2
' @entity15 showed what a team player he is , ' said @entity0			1
' people see him as that automatic next captain but that 's not necessarily the case			0
people are trying to catapult him into the next @entity17 but he is a totally different player			0
he is working his role very well			0
' @entity15 has been praised by his manager as a ' team player ' after @entity8 's win over @entity11 the @entity182 will take that slender one - goal lead into the second leg in @entity185 on thursday february 26			1
