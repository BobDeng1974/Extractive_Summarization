by @entity0 the routine is one that millions of women will recognise ; you step out of the shower , dry yourself with a towel , then blast your armpits with a spray of super-strong , all - action , perfume - steeped , heavily marketed anti-perspirant deodorant			1
leaving the house without it would be akin to stepping outside naked			0
@entity13 : @entity14 prefers to sweat as nature intended but not @entity14			1
this 47 - year - old beauty therapist from @entity17 has n’t worn deodorant for seven years			1
her armpits are washed and shaved and treated to a light dousing with essential oils , but that is it			0
she prefers to sweat as nature intended			2
and before anyone assumes @entity14 reeks , she is quick to point out that she has n’t had a single complaint in all the years she has avoided the chemicals			1
@entity14 , who runs her own salon , is among a growing number of people who dare to leave their armpits unsprayed			1
actress @entity32 said last month she has n’t worn anti- perspirant for 20 years			1
actors @entity34 and @entity36 claim never to spray their underarms			0
@entity36 says the body ‘ self - cleans ’ , relying on showers , sometimes several times a day , to keep him fresh and odour - free			2
@entity32 told her interviewer : ‘ @entity42 is really bad for you			1
let it go and just trim your armpit hair so it does n’t hold on to the scent			0
you ’re stinky because you use anti-perspirant			2
it keeps all the stink in			0
’ @entity14 decided to change her lifestyle when her husband @entity48 coughed and spluttered as she sprayed the heavily scented fumes one morning			1
‘ it occurred to me that applying a thick layer of chemicals to my body every morning might be something i should — and could — avoid , ’ she says			2
in recent years , some scientists have raised concerns about some underarm products			1
they fear that chemicals called parabens and aluminium residues that block the pores to reduce sweating could be absorbed through the delicate skin under the arm — particularly after shaving the area — and trigger cancerous changes in breast tissue			1
the anti-spray crew : actress @entity32 has n't worn anti-perspirant for 20 years , and actor @entity36 has vowed never to spray his underarms while cancer charities are adamant there ’s no strong evidence that either deodorants or anti-perspirants increase the risk of breast cancer , women are concerned			1
‘ i thought it ca n’t be healthy to have all those chemicals so close to sensitive breast tissue			1
i really hated the idea of clogging my pores with artificial gunk , ’ says @entity14			1
‘ it was n’t easy giving up deodorant			0
my job means i can get quite hot at times , and i ca n’t afford for my clients to think i smell			0
‘ i did notice i was slightly sweatier under the arms at first , but i was really fastidious about keeping my armpits clean and hair - free			0
the @entity92 's deodorant and body spray market is valued at £ 459 million ‘ as far as i could tell , i did n’t smell and so far i ’ve not had any complaints			1
’ at first , @entity14 used a crystal deodorant stick ( around £ 5 in health stores ) , which you wet and apply			1
fans claim the crystal residues and natural mineral salts inhibit growth of smell - inducing bacteria			1
she then switched to an essential oil spray from @entity104 ( £ 8 ) , which does not contain aluminium or preservatives , but claims to keep levels of pong - causing bacteria down			2
‘ it smells divine and i ’m confident it works with my body , not against it , ’ she says			0
@entity32 ’s theory about anti-perspirant being the cause of body odour may not be backed by science , but it is true that human sweat is n’t inherently smelly — it is almost odourless			1
any bad smell comes as bacteria break down proteins in the sweat into smaller molecules of acid			2
we have sweat glands all over our body ( 2.6 million of them ) , but sweat that smells is produced only by certain glands ( apocrine glands ) in the groin , armpits , lip and scalp , and develop at puberty			2
feeling cool : despite getting hot at work , @entity14 did n't smell dr @entity141 , a consultant neurologist and sweat expert at @entity143 in @entity144 , explains there are two chemical processes at work in most products			1
deodorants , which spread a layer of antibacterial chemicals on the skin to inhibit the bacterial action , and anti- perspirants , which contain chemicals — usually aluminium salts — to reduce sweating by blocking sweat ducts			2
but some people might not need to use anti-perspirant at all			0
research studies have shown as many as one in 50 people could carry a mutated gene that means their armpits simply do n’t smell			0
people with the gene ( called @entity166 ) are missing a certain chemical in their armpits that odour - causing bacteria feed on			2
the only way to know you ’ve got the no - smell gene is to check your ear wax			0
if it ’s dry , white and flaky rather than the normal dark and sticky , you might be an @entity166 carrier			0
or you could always just stop using your anti-perspirant and see what happens			0
@entity177 , 36 , from @entity178 , did			0
the mother of two stopped buying underarm products five years ago			1
‘ i was doing a lot of exercise — running and gym classes , ’ she says			0
‘ i did n’t always remember to take my anti-perspirant to the gym and as the weeks went by it seemed superfluous anyway , as i was only ever a few hours away from my next session and my next shower			0
’ when she started a family , she found she did n’t need to use anti-perspirant at all			0
‘ i can be more relaxed because i ’m at home with the children , not in an office where i might have to worry about whether or not i smell , but i ’m pretty sure i do n’t smell , ’ she says			0
whether most of us are brave enough to put the theory to the test is another matter .			0
