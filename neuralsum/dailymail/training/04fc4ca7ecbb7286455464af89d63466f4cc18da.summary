@entity0 has identified previous @entity2 experience as the key attribute he desires in any potential @entity4 buys this january			1
the @entity4 manager is ready to add to his squad in the new year as they bid to prove the naysayers wrong and avoid an immediate demotion back to the second tier			2
it has been a case of so far , so good for last year 's @entity12 runners - up , who lifted themselves out of the division 's bottom three with victory over @entity15 last weekend			1
@entity16 bundled the ball home from close range to give @entity4 a valuable win against @entity15 but ahead of a daunting nine - day period , which includes fixtures against @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 before the new year arrives , @entity0 is mindful that his inexperienced group may need some know - how down the stretch			1
@entity35 internationals @entity29 and @entity31 , neither of whom had played in the @entity2 before this season , were @entity0 's most recent recruits and he admits there will be a shift in his approach to next month 's window			1
' our market last year was particularly different , it 's slightly different now , ' said the @entity44 boss			0
' it 's not that we 're not looking at younger players - that 's quite obvious with @entity29 here and @entity49 - we still take value in young players			2
but it is also fair to say we are looking for players who 've had a feel of the @entity2			0
@entity0 makes his way onto the pitch ahead of @entity4 's match with @entity15 on saturday ' we are not necessarily a young group , but we 're quite an inexperienced group as regards regular @entity2 football			1
' there was no summer splurge at @entity62 , although @entity63 did acquire some players who had vast experience at this level			2
however , with @entity68 and @entity69 both out injured due to ankle problems , and 33 - year - old @entity71 very much on the periphery of the first - team picture , those players have not had a great impact			2
@entity75 , 36 , is also sidelined so the starting line - up which @entity0 will likely deploy at @entity23 on saturday will include just two players - @entity78 and @entity79 - who made more than 10 top - flight starts before this campaign			1
' we 've got a group who 've maybe had a season in it , but it would be nice to have a few more who 've been around it a long time , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity16 celebrates with his team - mates after scoring the all - important goal to give his side a valuable win ' @entity92 's been in it for years but he 's injured , @entity94 's at the other end of his career and he knows what part he plays for us now			0
so there 's a balance to how we 're monitoring players now			0
' while @entity0 trains his thoughts on possible incomings , he knows that the speculation regarding @entity4 striker @entity107 ' future is unlikely to go away any time soon			1
the 22 - year - old is out of contract in the summer and this week both @entity110 and @entity111 were mooted as potential destinations			0
yet his manager remains unmoved by the transfer talk having heard it all before			0
' we do n't need to ignore it , we 're just used to it , ' @entity0 said			0
' he 's used to it , i 'm used to it			0
it 's not a new story - people were talking about @entity125 last year from the beginning of the season so we 're used to it			0

@entity4 finished runners - up in the @entity12 last season
@entity4 moved out of the *relegation* *zone* with @entity15 win last week
