the group @entity7 and the @entity8 filed a federal lawsuit wednesday in @entity10 , on behalf of @entity11 , a 19 - year - old from the @entity13 borough of @entity14			1
@entity11 , a sophomore studying finance and business analytics at @entity17 on @entity18 , said he has had a lifelong interest in public service and began thinking of a military career several years ago			1
his lawsuit said he speaks four languages — @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 — and he said he wants to work in military intelligence			1
@entity11 , a student at @entity17 , says the @entity2 is barring him from the @entity3 unless he violates his religious beliefs by removing his turban , shaving and cutting his hair ' it has been one of those passions and dreams , ' he told @entity34 in a telephone interview this week			1
' if you look back in history , @entity1 have a very rich military tradition			0
we have always stood up to oppression and stand up for justice			0
' @entity42 , a 500 - year - old religion founded in @entity43 , requires its male followers to wear a turban and beard and keep their hair uncut			1
under a policy announced in january , troops can seek waivers on a case - by - case basis to wear religious clothing , seek prayer time or engage in religious practices			0
approval depends on where the service member is stationed and whether the change would affect military readiness or the mission			2
there are currently only a few @entity1 serving in the @entity2 who have been granted religious accommodations			0
under a policy announced in january , troops can seek waivers on a case - by - case basis to wear religious clothing , seek prayer time or engage in religious practices but @entity8 attorney @entity70 said the only remedy offered to @entity11 is a @entity72 : he must comply with military rules and only then ask for a waiver that would allow him to wear his turban , beard and long hair			1
@entity11 is being permitted to audit the rotc classes , said lt. col. @entity79 , commander of @entity17 's program , which trains students to become commissioned officers			2
@entity84 and his attorneys argue that he is not receiving credit for the classes , nor is he eligible for potential rotc scholarships because he is not an actual enlistee			0
@entity70 also said @entity11 will not be permitted to audit the classes after his sophomore year			1
lt. col. @entity92 said in a statement that the @entity2 does not comment on pending litigation			0

' a statement from @entity17 said it supports ' @entity11 's ambitions to serve his country			2
