attack : lord judge said the way the @entity4 - based court ordered @entity5 to follow its instructions was ‘ a negation of the democratic process ’ the @entity10 is a threat to democracy , a former lord chief justice said yesterday			1
lord judge said the way the @entity4 - based court ordered @entity5 to follow its instructions was ‘ a negation of the democratic process ’			1
@entity4 demands , he said , meant that political decisions were left ‘ exclusively to a body of unelected judges ’			0
and lord judge , who retired last year as the most senior judge in @entity22 and @entity23 , said the campaign by the human rights court to impose its will on @entity27 ‘ represents a dramatic and unconstitutional extension of judicial authority ’			2
in the strongest attack on @entity4 made by a leading @entity5 legal authority , lord judge ’s comments came at a key moment in the political struggle over @entity36 between the @entity37 and @entity38 and at a time when @entity4 is pressing the @entity40 to heed the court ’s requirement that @entity5 allows convicted prisoners to vote			1
lord judge , 73 , has previously made measured criticisms of the court			2
but in an article for the @entity49 ’s magazine , @entity50 , he accused the court and its leaders of trespassing beyond the bounds of @entity5 ’s constitution and the democratic practices that underpin it			2
‘ in any country which embraces the principle of democracy , and certainly in the @entity5 , ultimate authority over constitutional and societal questions is not vested in a body of judges , however wise and distinguished , and even if the system for their appointment is beyond criticism , ’ lord judge said			1
he added that the @entity69 did not give @entity4 the right to impose its rule on @entity5			1
‘ the debates in @entity27 show that the suggestion that legislative authority should be given to the @entity4 court to bind our courts here was expressly rejected , ’ he said			0
‘ and if it could not bind our courts , it certainly could not bind @entity27			0
’ in 2004 , the court backed claims made by axe killer @entity82 and ordered that @entity5 must overturn centuries of practice and allow at least some convicted prisoners to vote in elections			0
lord judge noted that the president of the @entity4 court , @entity88 , has said governments must change their laws when told to do so			1
‘ if he is right , whether or not @entity27 agrees , @entity27 is bound to enact laws which will bring the decisions of the @entity4 court into effect			0
‘ in my view it would be a negation of the democratic process for members of @entity27 to be obliged to vote for a measure with which they disagree			0
’ tyrannical : in an article for the @entity49 ’s magazine , @entity50 , lord judge accused the court and its leaders of trespassing beyond the bounds of @entity5 ’s constitution and the democratic practices that underpin it lord judge also pointed to a section of the controversial @entity112 of the code , which is supposed to guarantee the right to private and family life and says the right operates only as far as ‘ is necessary in a democratic society ’			1
lord judge said : ‘ if what the president says is correct , what constitutes a necessity in a democratic society is left , in the ultimate analysis , exclusively , to a body of unelected judges , and has been removed from the legislative body elected through ordinary democratic processes			2
‘ the respect owed by @entity27 to the views expressed by that court is embodied in the @entity69 itself			0
but , using the president ’s language , the imposition of those views on @entity27 represents a dramatic and unconstitutional extension of judicial authority			0

lord judge takes aim at court **'s** insistence that convicts be allowed the vote
he slams judges for ' trespassing beyond bounds of @entity5 **'s** constitution '
