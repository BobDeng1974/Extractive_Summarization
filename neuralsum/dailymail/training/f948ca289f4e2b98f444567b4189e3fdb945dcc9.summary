a mother says she gave birth to a perfectly healthy daughter despite doctors advising her to terminate her pregnancy because the baby was ‘ brain damaged ’			1
@entity7 , 38 , says it was only her mother ’s instinct that saved baby @entity10 , two			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ we were told @entity10 was probably severely brain damaged and would n't be able to communicate with or recognise us			1
@entity7 and @entity13 ( pictured with their children @entity10 , two , @entity16 , four , and @entity17 , nine ) were told @entity10 would be born severely brain damaged and doctors suggested they considered aborting her ‘ it was a terrible decision to have to come to			1
we agonised over what we should do right up until the last minute			0
’ mrs @entity7 , and her husband @entity22 , 38 , were delighted when they discovered they had conceived their third child			1
but their joy turned to despair when an mri scan revealed a shadow on their unborn daughter 's brain			2
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ we were so happy that our two sons would have a little brother or sister			2
‘ it felt awful to see the doctors looking so worried			0
they immediately ordered another urgent scan			0
’ the repeat scan at @entity41 in @entity42 apparently confirmed @entity43 and mrs @entity7 's worst fears - their daughter was diagnosed with a condition called holoprosencephaly , meaning she was probably severely brain damaged			1
the couple agonised over the decision but decided to give @entity10 a chance			1
they were shocked when she was born and turned out to be completely healthy mrs @entity7 said : ' it was a waking nightmare			1
we agonised every minute over what to do - and every time i felt her kick inside me , my heart broke ' ‘ the doctors said she might never walk , talk , or recognise our faces , ’ said mrs @entity7 , a bank administrator			1
‘ it was also possible she 'd be physically and facially deformed			0
there were a lot of unknowns			0
’ although mrs @entity7 was , at 30 weeks pregnant , beyond the normal limit for abortion , doctors advised termination as an option because holoprosencephaly would prevent the child from enjoying a meaningful quality of life			1
@entity77 is a condition in which the front part of the brain of an embryo fails to form two hemispheres			0
the condition varies in severity but about 80 per cent of children with holoprosencephaly have facial abnormalities			0
takling about @entity10 's birth @entity88 said : ' the midwives were baffled			2
the doctors ran the standard tests and @entity10 passed them all with flying colours			1
she was completely healthy ' almost all children with the condition experience developmental delays and many have seizures			1
most babies with the condition do not survive infancy			0
the condition affects about one in 10,000 live - born babies			2
‘ the doctor said it was n't too late if we wanted to abort the baby - he made it sound almost as if there was no other option , ’ said mrs @entity7			1

source : @entity130 ‘ i was shocked - it was as if i was having an out - of - body experience			2
i thought i was watching someone else getting the news			0
it was a dreadful experience			0
’ mrs @entity7 added : ‘ it was a waking nightmare			2
we agonised every minute over what to do - and every time i felt her kick inside me , my heart broke			2
‘ we did n't know whether we could face aborting our baby , but at the same time we wondered how we would cope with a disabled child			0
’ six weeks before her due date the couple arrived at the hospital for a meeting where they would give their final decision			1
‘ driving to the hospital , even at that late stage , we still did n't know what to do , ’ said mrs @entity7			2
‘ i just could n't let go of my child , but i also had to think of the baby 's quality of life			0
‘ my instinct was that if the child would one day be capable of recognising us and of knowing who we are , we could n't go through with it			0
‘ we were told there was still a very slim chance that the baby would recognise us			1
we exchanged a look and both knew instantly that we could n't agree to the termination			0
’ the couple braced themselves and mrs @entity7 delivered her daughter by caesarean section in october 2011			1
after the birth , the couple , from @entity42 , were amazed to discover that , far from being physically deformed , their daughter was perfectly well			0
mr and mrs @entity7 said they were initially relieved after the birth but that they then started to feel angry when they thought about how close they had come to aborting @entity10			1
@entity10 is pictured with her brother , @entity17 mrs @entity7 said : ‘ the midwives were baffled			1
the doctors ran the standard tests and @entity10 passed them all with flying colours			1
‘ two days later @entity10 had another mri scan and we were told she did n't have holoprosencephaly at all			1
in fact , she was completely healthy			1
‘ the only explanation is that the original imaging and diagnosis had been completely wrong			1
’ relief turned to anger as @entity43 and mrs @entity7 realised how close they came to terminating the pregnancy			2
they wrote to their local @entity199 trust expecting an acknowledgement and explanation for the mistakes which had been made			0
dr @entity208 , medical director of @entity209 said : ‘ @entity209 investigated @entity43 and mrs @entity7 's concerns thoroughly and provided a full response in february 2012 , in which we expressed our unreserved sympathy for the distress they suffered			2
mrs @entity7 said : ' @entity10 's just perfect			1
i 'm just so glad i trusted my mother 's instinct and gave my girl the chance to live ' ‘ we are happy to meet with the family to discuss any on - going concerns that they may have			2
‘ this was a very difficult diagnosis to make and a number of very experienced and highly skilled professionals considered carefully how to provide that information to the family			0
‘ analysing and diagnosing the developing brain of an unborn baby is a difficult process and these cases are very rare			0
‘ the circumstances surrounding @entity43 and mrs @entity7 's pregnancy are also very rare and highlight the importance of providing the right support to couples through upsetting times			0
’ now two years old , @entity10 has met all her developmental milestones and walks , talks and laughs along with her brothers @entity17 , nine , and @entity16 , four			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ @entity10 's just perfect			1
i 'm just so glad i trusted my mother 's instinct and gave my girl the chance to live			0

@entity7 and @entity13 were told baby @entity10 was brain damaged after a scan

the couple agonised over the decision and decided to give her a chance
when she was born they were shocked to be told she was actually completely healthy - and the imaging and diagnosis had been wrong
