leap of faith : @entity6 makes it to the other side of the 120ft - wide island safe landing : the champion safely hits the water on the other side of the island mission complete : @entity6 speeds off after jumping over the island in one leap ' i was constantly worried i would hit the beach or the shallow water on the other side - that would not have made for a soft landing			2
