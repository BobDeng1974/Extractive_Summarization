by @entity1 reporter published : 09:59 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 27 november 2013 a group tasked with protecting the welfare of animals in the film industry blasted as ' misleading ' a report suggesting it turns a blind eye to abuse because it is too cosy with @entity8			1
the @entity9 listed alleged incidents on films including the @entity13 - winning ' @entity12 ' , where it said the bengal tiger which is central to the movie nearly drowned			1
twenty - seven animals involved in making the first movie of the @entity22 trilogy died , it said , also listing incidents where a chipmunk was squashed , a husky dog was punched , and fish died in making ' @entity27 '			1
' ' the article is misleading and unfortunate , ' @entity32 senior advisor @entity41 told @entity43			1
' i really think that the article does not paint a very accurate picture of the program and the hard work that we do out there in the field			2
' ' the article paints a picture that is completely unrecognizable to us or anyone who knows ( our ) work , ' added the group , which confers the ' no animals were harmed ' stamp listed at the end of films it has monitored			2
incredible : four horses died during the filming of @entity67 's luck four deaths : the four horses passed during the filming of only nine episodes in its latest issue the @entity9 quotes an @entity32 monitor about an incident in which @entity75 , the tiger which shares a shipwrecked lifeboat in @entity79 director @entity78 's ' @entity12 ' , allegedly nearly drowned			1
in an email , the monitor recounted how the tiger ' got lost trying to swim to the side , ' adding : ' damn near drowned ... i think this goes without saying but do n't mention it to anyone , especially the office ! ' ' that was unfortunate , ' conceded @entity32 advisor @entity41 , referring to the email			1
' we believe that she exaggerated			0
but the bottom line was ... the animal did not suffer any harm			0
' cats are good swimmers ! ' she added			0
several dozen dead marine animals washed ashore during the filming of @entity27 : @entity97 the industry journal also cited the case of a horse dying in the making of @entity103 's @entity13 - nominated 2011 film ' @entity104 ' , and dozens of fish washed after special effects explosions on the ' @entity27 ' set			1
a @entity103 spokesman said the @entity9 story was exaggerated , but essentially accurate in terms of its description of what happened on ' @entity104 '			0
' what they wrote was essentially what happened , ' spokesman @entity114 told @entity43			0
' but there was no cover up ... the whole story is rather exaggerated in many places			0
' safety was the prime consideration throughout the entire film , ' he said			2
lucky to be alive : a monkey perches on @entity128 's shoulder during the filming of failure to launch how did this happen : a squirrel similar to this one was crushed to death by the production crew of @entity137 the industry journal 's lengthy investigation claimed the @entity32 has a fundamental conflict of interest , because its funding came from two industry bodies			1
@entity41 said the group got about two thirds of its funding from industry , but insisted : ' those funds are neutral			0
nobody tells us what sets we can monitor , how we 're to monitor them			0
' ' far from allowing abuse or neglect to occur , we have a remarkably high safety record of 99.98 percent on set , ' added the @entity32 statement			1
it acknowledged that accidents did occur			0
' over a span of many years , despite our best efforts , there have occasionally been rare accidents , most of them minor and not intentional			0
' but @entity166 , a veteran @entity167 prosecutor who ran a city @entity169 , told the @entity8 reporter : ' it 's fascinating and ironic : from being the protectors of animals they 've become complicit to animal cruelty			2
