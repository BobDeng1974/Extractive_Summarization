you 've grappled with the fake tan , finally located your passport among a pile of old bills and fought your way through the sales to find that elusive bikini in your size			2
but just when you think everything is sorted for your summer break , a new baggage restriction throws a spanner in the works			2
this month , @entity15 announced it was reducing cabin baggage size by a third , so only cases measuring a teeny - tiny 50cm x 40cm x 20cm could be guaranteed on board			1
sorted : even @entity19 could n't quibble with this tiny but thoroughly stylish case of clothes anything above that may have to be checked in on busier flights , leading to long waits by the baggage carousel at the other end			1
so is it really possible to pack for a week ’s short - haul sunshine trip inside those tight parameters ? yes , if you choose every item carefully and use some nifty packing tricks			1
luckily , we have done the hard work for you and here is our no - nonsense guide to travelling light			1
@entity40 - @entity39 there is no better way to switch from beach to restaurant than an elegant kaftan ( £ 12 , clothingattesco.com )			1
pick a material that dries quickly and wo n’t crease too much so it can be folded small and slotted into your case			0
you can easily throw this on over a bikini , but it also doubles up for evening when teamed with trousers and a necklace			0
the only other top you need is a silk shirt — the one luxury piece to give any outfit a glamorous edge			0
@entity61 and @entity62 , £ 12 , clothingattesco.com @entity64 shirt , £ 220 , equipment at @entity66 choose a bright shade like this pink to give a real pop of colour ( £ 220 , equipment at trilogystores.co.uk )			0
you can button it up , tuck it in , wear it over your swimwear , knot it over a maxi dress — the possibilities are endless			0
this is the toughest item to pack , so fold gently and put in your case last to avoid creasing			0
@entity83 a lingerie pouch or drawstring bag ( @entity86 , £ 15 , phoebecarlyle.com ) is a brilliant idea for space and practicality			1
you can pack all your underwear flat inside it , which keeps it together in one place			0
this is especially handy if your bag gets searched at the airport , as it avoids your undies being on display to security and nosy passers - by			1
@entity102 see - through plastic toiletries case ( @entity104 , £ 22 , greenandspring.com ) will make your life , and your packing , so much easier			1
these cases are n’t as bulky as some , plus they can be whipped out to go through airport scanners without having to dig around in your case and disrupt your neatly - packed clothes			1
as for the toiletries themselves , either pick travel - size items or decant your favourite creams and cleansers into mini containers			1
white trousers , £ 29 , @entity119 at @entity120 nautical shorts , £ 39 , toast.co.uk trousers and shorts you need just one pair of trousers and one pair of shorts to complete your wardrobe — and ideally you should choose neutral tones to allow you to play with colour on the top half and avoid clashes			1
we ’ve opted for this simple pair of smart white trousers ( £ 29 , johnlewis.com ) , which are easy to dress up or down and can be neatly folded and slotted on top of the dresses			1
these lightweight nautical shorts ( £ 39 , toast.co.uk ) are a great staple as they can be teamed with swimwear or a shirt and they fold up into a tiny square to be stacked into the case			1
dresses forget skirts and tops — three multi-tasking dresses are far more space - efficient			1
choose a casual day dress , a comfortable but stylish maxi and a glamorous evening dress for that special dinner out			0
pick your materials wisely : chiffon and jersey are great , as they fold away to very little and tend not to crease			0
we ’ve opted for : a white and navy - @entity160 jersey dress ( £ 35 , oasis - stores.com ) perfect for day - trips and sightseeing ; an aubergine jersey maxi dress ( £ 220 , heidiklein.com ) , which can be worn casually or dressed up with a necklace and wedges ; and a wow - factor red chiffon dress ( £ 145 , coast - stores.com )			1
roll the jersey dresses into tubes to slot into spaces in your bag and lay the chiffon dress along the bottom of the case — the floaty fabric takes up little depth			1
breton dress , £ 35 , oasis - @entity182 chiffon dress , £ 145 , coast - @entity182 @entity185 maxi , £ 220 , heidiklein.com thong sandals , £ 85 , russellandbromley.co.uk @entity188 wedges , £ 60 , office.co.uk shoes if you are tight for space , make do with two pairs of shoes for your trip — flat sandals and wedges			1
flats like these thong sandals ( £ 85 , russellandbromley.co.uk ) are easy to pack by lying them sole to sole and slotting them down the side of your case			0
choose a slightly dressier style , rather than flip - flops , to take you from beach to bar			2
although they will be your bulkiest item , a pair of raffia wedges ( £ 60 , office.co.uk ) is more versatile than standard high heels			0
use up the space inside by stuffing them with your swimwear			2
@entity217 two bikinis and a one - piece swimming costume is plenty for a week away			2
if you choose a sleek bandeau swimsuit , like this white one ( £ 199 , @entity224 at @entity225 ) , it can double up as a top to go under your shirt			0
ideally , choose notably different styles of bikini			0
we went for a purple triangle ( top , £ 100 , bottoms , £ 85 , olgaolsson.com ) and a navy nautical style ( top , £ 19.50 , bottoms , £ 16 , marksandspencer.com ) , which will look more varied and interesting on the beach			0
try to be creative with the way you pack your swimwear			0
a triangle bikini , for example , can be folded in half and then tied in a tiny package with the strings , to then be pushed inside your wedges			2
white swimsuit , £ 199 , @entity224 at @entity225 purple top , £ 100 , bottoms , £ 85 , olgaolsson.com nautical top , £ 19.50 , bottoms , £ 16 , marksandspencer.com sunglasses , £ 9.99 , zara.com statement necklace , £ 31 , reiss.com accessories to keep to your limit , you only really need two accessories : sunglasses and a statement necklace			2
sunglasses ( £ 9.99 , zara.com ) are a style staple and essential to protect your eyes — but they can be easily breakable so put them in the middle of your case to protect them			0
a statement necklace ( £ 31 , reiss.com ) really updates your outfit for the evening , if you throw it on with your maxi dress or your kaftan			0
if it ’s delicate or valuable , pop it into your underwear pouch to keep it safe			0
and finally : to broaden your choices even more , choose a travelling outfit to mix and match with the rest of your capsule wardrobe and wear your bulkiest items to go in .			2

@entity15 *'s* hand luggage limits are now a tiny 50cm x 40cm x 20cm
but you can beat the squeeze by packing a space - saving wardrobe
in the bag are everything from toiletries to dresses and accessories
