a group of 14 young volunteers listened to the concertos while performing a challenging mental task			0
at the same time , scientists measured the electrical activity of their brains			0
results showed that participants carried out the task faster and more accurately while listening to the uplifting strains of the @entity6 concerto			1
uplifting music can boost mental alertness and concentration , according to researchers who studied the effect of @entity7 's @entity6 they slowed down during the more sombre @entity6 passage			1
psychologist dr @entity25 , from the @entity26 , said : ' the @entity6 movement enhanced overall activity within the brain but had an exaggerated effect on the area of the brain that 's important for emotional processing			2
' it seemed to give rise to particular imagery in the brain and evoke positive , contented feelings which translated into higher levels of cognitive functioning			0
' the task involved pressing the space bar on a computer keyboard whenever a green square appeared on the screen			0
different coloured circles and squares that appeared intermittently had to be ignored			0
when tested in silence , the volunteers ' average response time was 408.1 milliseconds			0
this fell to 393.8 milliseconds during the @entity6 concerto , compared with 413.3 milliseconds during the @entity6 concerto			1
those who listened to the uplifting @entity6 concerto by @entity7 ( pictured ) carried out tasks faster and more accurately than the more sombre @entity6 passage the findings are published in the journal @entity59			1
dr @entity25 pointed out that the @entity6 movement had been successfully used in marketing to alter mood and influence behaviour			2
he added : ' the current study provides evidence that there is an indirect effect of music on cognition that is created by mood , alertness and emotion			2
' this experiment shows that cognitive capacity is enhanced when pleasant and arousing stimuli are introduced			0
' both pieces were written in major keys , suggesting that major or minor key type makes no difference to the impact of music on mental performance			2
music based on a minor key is often associated with sadness , yet the more downbeat @entity6 concerto in @entity7 's @entity6 is written in a major key .			1

uplifting music can boost mental alertness and concentration , *speeding* up tasks
*people* were more alert during the uplifting @entity6 concerto than the more sombre @entity6 passage
