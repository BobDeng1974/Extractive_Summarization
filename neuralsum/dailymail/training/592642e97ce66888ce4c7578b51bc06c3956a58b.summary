' the book , which will hit shelves on tomorrow , will guide readers through the perilous world of first dates , falling in love , break - ups and the emotional minefield of exes , but most importantly how a strong woman playing the game should never be played - something @entity6 now knows all about			1

way too often , girls fall for players who they know are going to screw them over , or they throw themselves at guys and wonder why they 've never heard from them again , or they stay in dead - ­ end relationships because they are too scared of being alone			0
these girls are n't strangers , they 're me , they 're my friends , they 're all of us			0
but it 's not our fault			0
dating nowadays is seriously complicated and the more attached we get to someone the more confusing it seems to become			0
that 's why i decided to write this book			2
it 's taken a lot of long and painful lessons for me to work out how to play the dating game and i 've often wished someone could have just told me the rules from the start , before i had to learn them the hard way			0
do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying that i 've mastered them all or that i 've got a perfect track record			0
in fact , as you will find out in this book , my experience of cheats , double betrayals and public scandals makes my record far from ideal ! but the dating mistakes i 've made and the experiences i 've had to go through have taught me that i wo n't put up with anybody who does n't treat me the way i deserve , ever again			2
i am never going to settle for just any guy that comes along … it 's got to be the right guy			0
and , hopefully after reading my book , neither will you			2
it 's about time that we learned how to play men at their own game			0
in @entity126 , i 've hopefully covered all the bases , from being single , to going on first dates and figuring out if he 's that interested , to making a relationship work and even how to get over an ex. i want to make sure that if we play the dating game properly none of us will be played ever again .			2
