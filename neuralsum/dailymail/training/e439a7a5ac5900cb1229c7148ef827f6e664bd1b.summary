by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:56 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 07:47 est , 13 august 2013 ' a ' fruitcake test ' has been used by the @entity4 @entity3 to uncover unsuitable characters who might embarrass the party			0
psychometric tests were used to analyse the personalities , reliability and honesty of more than 300 people wanting to run in next year ’s @entity14 elections			1
experts were called in to prevent a repeat of may ’s local elections when @entity3 candidates were accused of sexism , racism and homophobia			1
but one candidate who passed with flying colours was @entity24 , the sitting mep who last week railed against @entity4 giving aid to ‘ @entity26 ’			1
pass : @entity3 's @entity24 cleared the party 's psychometric testing , but last week caused a political storm after complaining about @entity4 aid being sent to @entity26 land @entity3 leader @entity32 ordered a shake - up of the party selection process to weed out people with views which risked living up to @entity38 ’s infamous claim that the party was a ‘ bunch of fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ’			1
a professional recruitment company was hired to oversee the process , ahead of elections to the @entity47 in may 2014			2
many predict @entity3 could top the poll – forcing the @entity50 into second place - but such success will bring unprecedented levels of scrutiny			0
@entity55 160 questions about your personality and rank response 1 - 7 media testface a grilling from a journalist , giving soundbites without flustering writing @entity64 a press release which a local newspaper would willingly use public speaking @entity68 a room of people , who score your ability to wow a crowd information testscour a bundle of information and give a pithy response , in line with party policy at a gruelling bootcamp candidates faced 160 questions about their personalities , where they were asked to rank their responses from 1 to 7			1
the answers were then analysed to see if they were consistent to weed out anyone displaying dishonest traits or ‘ game ’ the system			0
would - be politicians went on to face a series of tasks to see if they could cope with the pressure of being a @entity3 representative			2
it included a series of grillings by a panel of party bigwigs , and mock media interviews to see how they would fare being torn apart by a @entity102 or @entity103			2
a writing test challenged them to produce a press release which might get used by local newspapers			2
in another section , each candidate was given a large bundle of information from which they had to produce a pithy response , which was in line with party policy			0
as the 300 were whittled down to just 77 , successful candidates included @entity118 journalist @entity117 , mr @entity24 and mr @entity32			2
but @entity119 , currently @entity120 for the @entity121 , did not make the grade			1
journalist @entity123 , who boasted on his application form that his skills include ' winding up greenies or lefties ' , was also rejected			2
in a letter to members he said : ' ‘ i ’ve just this second had a call from [ @entity3 chairman ] @entity133 telling me i did n’t make the cut anyway			0
' apparently – quelle surprise ! – i did well on the public speaking bit ; but fell down on the psychometric testing ( ! ) and the interviews			1
' seems what you ’re looking for is solid candidates with years of party membership and proven dedication to the nitty gritty of party business			0
well if those are your criteria , you ’ve certainly done the right thing ! ’ former @entity150 mp @entity149 was not included on the list , but mr @entity32 is reportedly planning a ' different leading role for the party '			0
thumbs down : the new process ordered by @entity3 leader @entity32 saw just 77 out of 300 wannabe politicians make it through to the next stage to even get to the stage of being considered for selection to stand in the @entity162 elections , they first had to have passed a test set for anyone wanting to be a @entity3 mp			1
this included five tests covering knowledge of party policy , media scrutiny and public speaking			1
only those who achieved an a grade even made it on to the long list to try to stand for @entity175			0
the final list of approved candidates will now be sent to every @entity3 member , who will vote on who should top the lists in each region for the @entity14 elections			0
during the local elections , @entity3 candidates were suspended or investigated after being pictured making a @entity186 salute , denying the @entity187 or having links to the @entity189			1
the party leadership hopes the tough new tests will prevent future similar embarrassment , but can not guarantee it			1
‘ no system designed by man will ever be foolproof , ’ said a source			0
meanwhile a @entity3 local council candidate is to be charged over claims that he used fake signatures on his election nomination form			0
@entity202 , who stood for election to @entity204 in may , is accused of causing or permitting a false statement to appear in a nomination paper .			0

personality quiz used to check the honesty and reliability of politicians
media skills , public speaking and *manifesto* knowledge also tested
@entity24 who complained about aid to ' @entity26 ' passed
but another mep @entity119 *failed* to make the grade
tough regime designed to prevent repeat of local elections embarrassment
