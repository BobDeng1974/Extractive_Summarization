@entity0 was noting the similarities between @entity2 and former @entity4 star @entity3 , when he highlighted one key difference			1
‘ he is quieter than @entity3 , but that is not difficult , ’ the @entity4 manager joked			2
@entity4 sorely missed @entity2 , their stand - out player since his £ 30million move from @entity9 in the summer , in the @entity11 defeat to @entity12			1
but the @entity13 has recovered from a hamstring injury which kept him out of the match and @entity0 was assessing his condition in training on monday before deciding whether to start him in tuesday ’s match against @entity20			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 was monitoring @entity2 's condition in training on monday the 26 - year - old is back for @entity4 to face @entity20 on tuesday evening after returning to training @entity2 has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season — including 12 in the @entity26 — and has impressed @entity0 with his tireless work rate as much as his attacking ability			1
‘ he is dynamic and he does both parts of the game			2
he ’s important in the team because of that , ’ @entity0 explained			2
‘ he wins you the ball back quickly as well			0
the transitions are very good from defence to attack and attack to defence			0
‘ he is a bit like @entity3			0
his enthusiasm is like the enthusiasm of @entity3			0
’ like @entity3 , who was the joker in the pack during his time in north @entity45 in addition to being a blistering goalscorer , @entity2 is a popular member of the @entity4 dressing room			1
at the moment he spends more time with the @entity52 - speaking players , largely because he has only started to pick up @entity53 following his summer transfer			2
@entity0 has likened @entity2 to former @entity4 legend @entity3 - who like the @entity13 scored goals for fun @entity3 celebrates the @entity60 ' @entity59 success over @entity61 at @entity62 in may 1998 but @entity0 revealed he is ‘ loved by everybody ’ and added : ‘ he is very friendly and bubbly every day			1
’ the @entity4 boss was not prepared to risk @entity2 against @entity12 in case he aggravated his hamstring to the point that it ruled him out for the remainder of the season			1
@entity0 sees the 26 - year - old as crucial to his side ’s chances of finishing in the top four this season , thus qualifying for the @entity74			1
‘ it was difficult for him not to play against @entity12 , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ if it was the last game of the season he would ’ve played			0
' he had a bit of a winter break now that he did n’t really want			0
but he got one and i think he will now be recovered and fit until the end of the season			0
‘ for us it is important that he has no setback as once you go into february , if you have a muscular injury and a guy has a setback , you say “ bye bye ” as the season is over as it is six weeks out			0
' by the time you come back to your full level it is april and that is why we did n’t take the gamble			0
