the @entity1 official accused last week of favouring @entity2 and @entity3 has been chosen to referee their @entity5 final against @entity6			1
@entity7 , a 42 - year - old who refereed the 2013 @entity9 final at @entity10 , will take charge of the match in the @entity13 on sunday but his appointment may be controversial			1
@entity20 claimed : ' i do n't want to be a cry baby , but i noticed the referee never gives fouls against @entity2			2
' every time something happens with @entity3 the referee gives him a free - kick			2
' i notice he [ @entity3 ] made three fouls and no yellow card , we made one foul and one yellow card			0
' @entity33 issue : referee @entity7 was accused of favouring @entity2 and @entity3 it will be the third time this @entity5 that @entity7 has refereed a match involving @entity2 - he was also in charge of the @entity40 ' 3 - 2 win over @entity41 in @entity42 his first match of the tournament was @entity46 's 5 - 1 triumph over @entity47 in the group stage			1
@entity49 , from @entity50 , had been viewed as one of the favourites for the final as he is from neither @entity54 nor @entity40 , but he does not have a team of assistants who work all the time with him			0
@entity59 's @entity58 was never in contention to referee the final - he was in charge of the 2010 showpiece and @entity64 has never before appointed an official to referee two @entity5 finals			0
under fire : @entity7 was the target of criticism from @entity21 boss @entity20 it was also felt that it would be too sensitive to have @entity58 referee a match in which @entity2 are involved - the team are still going through a @entity64 disciplinary process for displaying a banner claiming the @entity76 should belong to their country			1
furthermore , @entity2 's @entity64 senior vice-president @entity78 has never hidden his disdain for @entity59			0
in 2011 he called the @entity81 ' liars ' at the @entity82 and in an interview with the @entity85 press agency @entity84 referred to the @entity81 as ' pirates ' .			0

third time this @entity5 that @entity7 has refereed a match involving @entity2
@entity21 boss @entity20 accused @entity7 of favouring @entity2 and @entity3
the @entity1 refereed the 2013 @entity9 final at @entity10
