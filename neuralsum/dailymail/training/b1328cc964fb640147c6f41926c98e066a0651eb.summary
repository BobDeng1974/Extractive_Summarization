@entity0 used a made - up song title to hit back at those criticising him for telling @entity4 he was too tired to play for @entity5			1
@entity0 started on the bench for @entity5 's @entity8 qualifier in @entity9 before being brought on in the 64th minute , and won the free - kick that led to @entity12 's only goal			0
after the match , at around midnight , the 19 - year - old @entity14 winger said : ' now listening to ... excuse me for being human			2
' but while @entity0 made up a song title to let the world know his feeling on the matter , there were plenty of other real pieces of music he could have used to make his point			0
here are 10 suggestions for what could have made up @entity0 's sleepy playlist			0
( perhaps @entity0 could put them on his stereo for the next time he 's on @entity5 duty ? ) @entity0 ( centre ) sat on the @entity5 bench in @entity9 after telling @entity4 he was tired @entity0 told @entity4 he was feeling below par and not in the right mental state during training on saturday @entity39 made way for @entity0 in the 64th minute in @entity41 as @entity5 went on to beat @entity9 1 - 0 @entity0 appeared to hit back at those criticising his decision to pull out of the starting line - up @entity0 retweeted those criticising him online before writing : ' now listening to ... excuse me for being human ' @entity0 's sleepy playlist ... 1 : the @entity48 – i ’m so tired 2 : the who - substitute 3 : tight fit - @entity50 ( @entity52 ) 4 : @entity53 - @entity54 5 : @entity55 6 : @entity56 - so tired 7 : @entity58 - @entity57 given his infamous rock and roll lifestyle , it 's no wonder that @entity56 sang that he was ' so tired ' 8 : @entity63 and @entity62 ? 9 : @entity64 – @entity65 10 : the @entity66 @entity67 sang ' take me dancing tonight ' in this song , but @entity0 might not agree with that sentiment @entity71 here 's one song title @entity0 definitely does n't want to tweet ... @entity74 - @entity73 @entity71 and here 's one that @entity0 's critics might want to reply with ... @entity77 @entity78 could n't stop moving their feet , but that 's not a feeling @entity0 experienced in @entity41 @entity83 but both sides should try and avoid resorting to this ... @entity86			1

@entity0 told @entity4 that he was too tired to play for @entity5
