by @entity0 in the near future , airlines could share tracking data and get free access to a range of cutting - edge technologies to prevent any more planes being lost without a trace			1
these are two of the suggestions made by the @entity12 's @entity11 ( @entity11 ) at an event in @entity14 this week , set up in the wake of the mysterious disappearance of @entity19 flight @entity17 in march			1
it follows separate plans from @entity23 - based @entity22 to offer free flight tracking to thousands of commercial passenger planes			1
experts gathered in @entity14 this week to discuss a worldwide framework for tracking flights			1
proposals include airlines being able to share data , and preventing tracking tools from being disabled			1
it was organised in the wake of the @entity17 disaster in march when a @entity37 plane , stock image pictured , went missing speaking at the event , the @entity11 said global flight tracking is now so vital , it has set a deadline for the processes to be in place by september			2
on board a plane there are cockpit voice and flight data recorders – the ‘ black boxes ’ – which each include a ‘ pinger ’ that sends a transmission up to 30 days after submersion underwater			2
in the black box is an @entity57 flight transponder which , unlike the @entity58 in a car , broadcasts its location by sending information back to air traffic controllers every second			0
crews are also able to speak to their airline through discrete radio channels			0
the cockpit voice recorders can additionally reveal conversations and other sounds to hint at problems that may have occurred during the flight			0
officials from 40 countries gathered for the @entity11 summit to discuss a range of tracking options			1
the organisation will now take this framework of worldwide standards and decide which solutions to put into place			2
during the summit , members were presented with a number of flight tracking technologies and protocols for tracking planes			0
one includes preventing anyone from being able to disable the flight tracking systems on all planes , while another suggested a global database so tracking data can be shared more easily			1
it is likely the organisation will choose a variety of tools and technologies to widen the scope of searches , rather than getting all airlines to subscribe to the same one			2
@entity102 , president of the @entity11 said : ' this systems - based approach acknowledges that what will best service airlines and manufacturers over the longer term will be the flexibility to choose from amongst the latest and most cost - effective innovations that meet their global flight tracking needs			1
' the @entity12 ' @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , stock image pictured , said global airline flight tracking is now so vital , it has set a deadline for proposals to be in place by september			1
it is likely the organisation will choose a variety of technologies to widen the scope of searches @entity22 's technology , pictured , helped reveal the last position of missing flight mh370 in march , and now the @entity23 - based firm is offering free tracking to 11,000 commercial passenger planes			1
in addition to free tracking , the company is also offering a ' black box in the cloud ' that will store historic and real - time flight data ' as @entity11 considers the requirements for global flight tracking , we will also be looking closely at the most effective means of sharing tracking data when needed with applicable search and rescue and accident investigation authorities			1
' satellite firm @entity22 announced its plans to track flights for free last week , as a direct response to the missing plane			1
in addition , the firm will also provide a ‘ position reporting ’ tool in case flights veer off track , and a so - called ‘ black box in the cloud ’ to track real - time data remotely			1
this remote black box is triggered automatically if the plane deviates off course , or communication is lost			0
and also sends historic recordings to a team of experts			0
@entity22 ’s service additionally streams cockpit voice recordings			0
@entity22 's remote black box is triggered automatically if the plane deviates off course , or communication is lost , and also sends historic recordings to a team of experts			1
the service additionally streams cockpit voice recordings			0
this graphic reveals how plane tracking technology works this service is being offered to planes which are already equipped with an @entity22 satellite connection , which the firm claims is ‘ virtually 100 per cent of the world ’s long haul commercial fleet ’			1
analysis of data from @entity22 and the @entity179 @entity178 in march showed the @entity37 plane crashed in the southern @entity181			2
@entity182 , chief executive of @entity22 , said : ' @entity22 has been providing global aviation safety services for over 20 years and we are confident that the proposals we have presented to @entity11 and @entity186 ( @entity186 ) represent a major contribution to enhancing aviation safety services on a global basis			2
the service is being offered to 11,000 planes already equipped with an @entity22 satellite connection , stock image of a @entity195 cockpit is pictured			0
the firm claims the service will cover ' virtually 100 per cent of the world 's long haul commercial fleet ' ‘ in the wake of the loss of @entity17 , we believe this is simply the right thing to do			0
‘ because of the universal nature of existing @entity22 aviation services , our proposals can be implemented right away on all ocean - going commercial aircraft using equipment that is already installed			2
' @entity17 vanished on 8 march with 239 people on board , during a flight from @entity210 to @entity211			0
evidence revealed on 15 march by the @entity19 prime minister @entity213 suggested the jet was deliberately diverted by someone on board			0
five days later , @entity218 search teams announced they were investigating two objects spotted on satellite images in the southern @entity181			0
on 24 march , @entity213 said analysis of satellite data - by @entity22 - confirmed the plane went down in the @entity181			2
more debris was spotted on 28 march			0
the latest update , at the start of last month , claimed to have detected ultrasonic signals from the plane 's black box			0
two months on , the plane has still not been found .			0

experts gathered in @entity14 this week to discuss global tracking options
the @entity12 's aviation organisation is now considering a worldwide framework
proposals put *forward* include airlines being able to share data more easily
another suggested preventing plane tracking tools from being disabled
last week , @entity23 - based @entity22 offered to track flights for free
in addition to tracking , @entity22 is also offering a position reporting tool
