@entity0 has accused the @entity1 of ' genocide denial ' and called for the corporation to be banned from the country after it aired a controversial documentary that questioned official accounts of the horrors of 1994			1
' @entity0 's @entity8 ' , broadcast this month , highlighted growing criticism of president @entity10 and alleged that his @entity11 ( @entity12 ) — then a rebel group , now the ruling political party — was behind the shooting down of a presidential plane that triggered the genocide			1
the @entity19 community has always been held responsible for the mass slaughter of @entity22 population in 1994 , when up to a million people were murdered in 100 days - a rate of slaughter that was faster than the @entity26 in the @entity27			1
but the @entity1 's programme included interviews with two @entity31 researchers who suggest that thousands of @entity19 could have been killed too , possibly by @entity12 forces			1
it claimed a @entity35 report expressing similar concerns had allegedly been suppressed			0
but the @entity1 documentary suggested many more hutus may have been killed by @entity54 ( pictured ) @entity56 historian prof @entity55 even tells the programme that @entity10 could be one of the ' most important war criminals still in office today '			1
now furious lawmakers in parliament have now called for the @entity63 licence the @entity1 uses to broadcast across the country — in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 — to be pulled and the programme 's producer and presenter be charged with genocide denial , a punishable crime in @entity0			2
' we must stand and fight against these deniers , ' @entity74 president @entity73 said , according to the @entity78 newspaper			0
' among the decisions we should consider is taking a legal action against the deniers , be it internally or externally , ' ' we should as well consider revising the agreements @entity0 has with @entity1			2
this is an open struggle that can not be taken lightly and should be taken on by everyone collectively			0
' ' genocide denial ' ? earlier this month , president @entity10 ( pictured with @entity89 prime minister @entity88 in 2007 ) told parliament that the @entity1 had chosen to ' tarnish @entity0 , dehumanise them ' and accused it of ' genocide denial ' horror : ethnic @entity92 troops look over a pile of skulls dug up to be reburied in a memorial for approximately 12,000 @entity22 massacred by @entity19 militia in and around the western town of @entity98 mp @entity99 said @entity0 should ' switch it off completely ' , the @entity78 added			1
earlier this month , @entity10 told parliament that the @entity1 had chosen to ' tarnish @entity0 , dehumanise them ' and accused it of ' genocide denial '			1
@entity102 was one of hundreds of thousands of @entity19 refugees brutalized and chased across @entity0 and into the @entity104 by forces that the @entity1 claimed were allied to president @entity10			1
she told the programme how she witnessed the repeated bombing of @entity19 refugee camps allegedly by @entity10 's artillery and the remains of @entity19 refugees piled up like a moutai			1
she told how she saw her own grandmother die of physical exhaustion before her own seven - year - old cousin , @entity114 , died on her back as she carried her though the forests to escape the massacres			0
perhaps most shockingly , she even described how her mother was forced to cut a deal with a local family , allowing @entity102 to be raped in exchange for safe passage out of the country			0
she told the programme : ' i can not explain what it is like to see children die like flies			0
one day i sat next to two dead children			0
i felt dead with them in the forest			0
' later she adds : ' [ the @entity22 militia ] killed all the refugees ... it was necessary to kill the greatest number of @entity19 refugees ... and they were killed because they were so many			1
' prominent international academics , experts and diplomats have echoed his comments , accusing the @entity1 of being ' recklessly irresponsible ' by allegedly promoting a revisionist account of the genocide in the documentary			2
' we urge the @entity1 to apologize for the offence this program has caused for all victims and survivors of the 1994 genocide in @entity0 , ' they said in a statement			1
the documentary producers are accused of attempting to acquit the @entity19 militia and reduce the number of @entity22 victims			1
according to the experts , the film - producers tried to decrease the number of @entity22 killed from 1 million to 200,000 and raise the number of @entity19 victims			1
' they even claim that in 1994 more @entity19 than @entity22 were murdered – an absurd suggestion and contrary to all the widely available research reported by @entity165 , @entity166 , the @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , a @entity35 @entity171 mandated @entity167 of experts and evidence submitted to the @entity174 and other @entity176 courts who have successfully put on trial several perpetrators , ' the experts claimed			1
@entity10 was himself asked about the programme during an appearance at the thinktank @entity182 in @entity183 this week			2
' for me as a @entity0 and the leader of @entity0 , i just wish we could concentrate on development of our country and being the best for our people , ' he said			2
' the @entity1 can say whatever they want to say			0
they do n't have to say or do , whatever they do or say , because that is right			0
they say or do whatever they say and do because they can			0
' the documentary suggested that president @entity10 ordered the downing of the plane of former president @entity197 , the act that is believed to have sparked the genocide			1
but @entity0 minister of foreign affairs @entity200 branded the documentary an ' attack on @entity0 and its people ' and said that her government is contemplating taking action against the @entity1			0
carnage : a @entity0 worker lays the remains of humans in @entity210 in 2000			0
authorities said at least 200,000 human remains were found in pit latrines , construction sites and behind churches			0
most of these @entity22 victims were either shot or hacked to death ' my government reserves the right to respond , on its own timing , in a manner commensurate with the weight of the offense , ' she told @entity226			0
april 6 1994 : president @entity197 dies when his plane is shot down en route home from peace talks with @entity12 rebels april 7 : it is not clear who is behind the shooting but it sparks the systematic mass killing of mainly @entity22 by extremist @entity19 militia and military elements april - july : an estimated 800,000 @entity22 and moderate @entity19 are slaughtered @entity12 denies accusations they killed thousands of @entity19 as they march through the country july : @entity12 captures the capital , @entity210 july : two million @entity19 flee to @entity104 , now @entity104 the @entity1 , one of the country 's most popular broadcasters , said the programme in ' no way ' sought ' to downplay or conceal the horrifying events of 1994 ' and subsequent events and denied that any part of the programme constitutes a ' denial of the genocide against the @entity22 '			1
it said : ' there are repeated references to the mass killings of @entity22 by @entity19 in 1994 and that this constituted genocide			1
the programme also includes an interview with the director of the @entity261 at @entity262 , a @entity22 and genocide survivor , and a convicted @entity19 genocidaire who spoke of his part in the killing of thousands of @entity22			2
' the @entity1 has a duty to investigate difficult and challenging subjects and we believe the programme is a valuable contribution to the understanding of the tragic history of the country and the region , and of the governance of @entity0 over the last 20 years			0
' the corporation also said there had been several attempts to ask the @entity0 government to respond to the allegations but in vain			0
students also marched through @entity210 on wednesday demonstrating against the @entity1			0
in 2009 , @entity0 temporarily banned the @entity1 's @entity66 broadcasts over comments also concerning the genocide			2
@entity288 of @entity169 wrote this week : ' these admirers – and others – seem to be willfully ignoring the darker side of @entity10 's record in office			2
@entity0 under @entity10 has no tolerance for dissent or political opposition … scores of @entity0 journalists have fled the country , unable to report freely and fearful for their safety			2
