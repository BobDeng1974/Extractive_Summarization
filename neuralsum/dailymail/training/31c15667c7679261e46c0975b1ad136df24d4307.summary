it appears to have been recorded during @entity3 's deadly attacks earlier this month			1
the decision not to broadcast the video , which was sent on a usb memory stick along with a letter to the station , came after @entity10 president @entity31 and family of the victims had asked for it not to be shown			1
police believe it was filmed by the gunman himself , who was killed last week after a 32 - hour stand - off with police at his apartment			2
@entity3 recorded all of his murders , which began on march 11 with the shooting of a @entity10 soldier			1

this is despite the fact that he is a convicted drug dealer who had next to nothing to do with his son from the age of six , and now lives in @entity65			0
mr @entity3 , who is in his 60s , said that his son , who murdered seven people in total , stood ‘ no chance ’ against the police			2
meanwhile , it has been claimed that the killer had spied for the @entity10 secret service before his ten - day spree			1

@entity125 , the network 's @entity25 bureau chief , said the note was written in poor @entity10 with spelling and grammatical errors			2
the images it accompanied appear to have been taken from the point of view of the killer , he said , perhaps from a camera hung around @entity3 's neck			2
they were shaky but of a high technical quality			0

you can hear the voice of this person who has committed these assassinations			0

@entity10 mourns : hundreds of people gather in @entity23 's @entity261 for a minute 's silence in memory of @entity3 's victims ' intelligence agents had watched him for long enough to come to the conclusion that there was no indication that this was a dangerous man who would one day pass from words to acts			1
' @entity3 was interrogated , watched and listened to , and appeared to be a man living a normal life			0
' the self - styled @entity90 warrior , who was shot dead by police marksmen , is said to be buried in @entity65 , so that his grave will not be desecrated in @entity10			2
