@entity0 were understandably giddy on thursday night as the announcement that they ’d landed @entity2 grew ever closer			2
the @entity5 ’ official @entity4 page posted that they had some ‘ transfer news coming up ’ before later posting that they could n’t wait to unveil the @entity8			2
amusingly , they ended up breaking their self - imposed embargo of 10 o’clock			0
hardly surprising , given the gravity of the signature they 'd acquired			0
@entity2 signed on a free transfer and is the most decorated player to ever don a @entity0 shirt			2
@entity18 looks back at some of the previous greats to have seen out twilight years in the @entity22			1
@entity27 turned out just a handful of times for the @entity5 , was n’t particularly fit and ended up taking the @entity36 job during his loan spell at @entity38			1
out - foxed : @entity27 moved enjoyed a long spell at @entity40 ( right ) and played for @entity0 in 2001 finding the net ! @entity42 celebrates after scoring for @entity43 at @entity44 in may 2004 legend : the @entity46 scored goals for @entity25 ( celebrating with @entity48 and @entity49 ) @entity42 to @entity43 ( from @entity50 in 2002 ) there is an argument that the @entity46 ’s real twilight was at @entity54 in 2004 , but at 32 it felt as if @entity42 was just giving the @entity22 a whirl with newly - promoted @entity43			1
it actually turned out to be a pretty profitable move – he scored 20 league goals			0
@entity60 to @entity43 ( from @entity61 in 2004 ) the former @entity63 captain struggled at centre - half , particularly when @entity65 terrorised him for @entity66 in a 3 - 2 defeat at @entity68			1
in fairness to @entity60 , his undoubted class in possession was there for all to see when sitting in front of the back four			1
@entity75 to @entity43 ( from @entity76 in 2002 ) four glorious years at the @entity77 saw the @entity78 earn deserved cult status			1
@entity75 was the heartbeat of that @entity43 side to continuously defy the top flight odds – his crowning moment being a superb free - kick on the last day of the 2002/03 season against @entity86 to clinch safety			1
decorated : @entity60 lifts the @entity88 in 2002 before a move to @entity43 have that ! @entity91 celebrates after scoring against @entity92 at the @entity77 during his stay legends : @entity95 ( left , @entity96 ) and @entity75 ( @entity43 ) made a real impact in @entity98 @entity91 to @entity43 ( from @entity99 in 2003 ) @entity91 played more than 150 games for the @entity101 in a five - year spell and is still chanted about by supporters six seasons after leaving			1
he remains close to the club – frequently tweeting about their fortunes			0
@entity95 to @entity96 ( from @entity107 in 1997 ) the @entity108 international did eventually end his career at @entity29 and @entity40 , but captured the imagination at @entity112			1
a goal on debut against @entity115 set him on his way and @entity95 was even appointed caretaker manager for a spell			1
@entity119 to @entity120 ( from @entity121 in 2003 ) the maverick ’s permanent deal did n’t go quite to plan , but the loan spell preceding that was hugely successful			0
@entity119 ’s ability to serve as a lynchpin – scoring goals and exciting @entity129 ’s – served as the stir @entity120 needed to finish 13th under @entity131			0
@entity133 goal : @entity134 scored important goals ( including here against @entity137 ) for @entity120 on the move : @entity139 rocked up at @entity86 after a spell up front for @entity31 giants @entity29 escape ! @entity139 tries to wriggle free of @entity143 against @entity144 at the @entity145 @entity139 to @entity86 ( from @entity29 in 2000 ) twenty - two league goals in 68 games was a decent return for the striker in a team trying to find their feet in the @entity22			1
@entity139 ’s execution was precise , his close control exquisite			0
@entity155 to @entity96 ( from unattached in 1998 – previously at @entity157 ) even though he enjoyed a better time at @entity96 than he endured at @entity157 , @entity155 has long been regarded as one of the worst players to grace @entity98 football			2
not too much healthier though - they released the @entity163 after just a season			0
@entity165 to @entity166 ( from @entity167 in 2000 ) not exactly the goal machine he had one been , @entity165 epitomised @entity166 at the time : a little bit slow and lacking ideas			2
he found the net just once in the league and was n’t best pleased with manager @entity173 either			0
not the best of times : @entity165 never got on at @entity166 after winning the @entity175 at @entity176 trouble in the east : @entity179 striker @entity178 never truly settled at @entity180 making his name : @entity178 was brilliant at @entity99 and won the golden boot at the @entity183 in 1998 @entity184 to @entity180 ( from @entity167 in 1996 ) a dazzling winger , @entity184 enjoyed the best of his career during a six - year stint at @entity189 but failed to nail down a club to stay at and became something of a journeyman			1
@entity193 was no different , even though he had the capacity to excite			0
@entity178 to @entity180 ( from @entity144 in 2000 ) @entity196 landed @entity178 12 months after the @entity183 in @entity46 on the strength of his golden boot , but the @entity199 failed to live up to expectation it was a similar story at @entity180 , too , and he left for @entity202 after a year			2
@entity203 to @entity86 ( from @entity29 in 2004 ) the @entity204 – remarkably to some – still lives in the @entity206 after a five - year love affair with @entity86 that , although laden with injuries , saw him become a hero			0
different worlds : @entity203 settled in @entity86 but made his name with @entity212			0

@entity27 also signed for the foxes , while @entity95 went to @entity96
@entity75 , @entity42 , @entity60 and @entity216 all *penned* deals with @entity43
@entity178 and @entity165 *flopped* in the @entity22
