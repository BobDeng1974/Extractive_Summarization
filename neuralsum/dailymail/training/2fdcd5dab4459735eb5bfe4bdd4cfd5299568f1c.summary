by @entity0 @entity1 : 03:48 est , 13 december 2012 @entity2 : 08:18 est , 13 december 2012 it was billed as a luxurious cruise around the romantic and atmospheric traditional @entity6 markets of northern @entity7			1
instead hundreds of passengers have been left quarantined in their cabins after a severe outbreak of norovirus – the winter vomiting bug – swept through the @entity14 cruise liner @entity15			1
travellers who paid up to £ 1,429 for the @entity18 trip say the liner has turned into a ' plague ship ' and describe themselves as angry and mutinous			1
@entity15 has been hit by bouts of norovirus several times in recent years and in 2009 one passenger on a @entity18 cruise died from the disease soon after docking in @entity42			1
in the latest outbreak some passengers say they have waited hours to be seen by the ship 's doctor , while others claim they have had to put up with an overwhelming stench of vomit below decks			1
and one man , who had to be treated by the ship 's doctor , was told he had racked up more than £ 1,000 in medical bills			2
passengers also claim they have been told that if they catch the virus it is their own fault for not being clean enough			2
although cruise bosses say no staff are sick , one passenger said they found a steward vomiting in her cabin toilet			2
tour : the ship was visiting @entity6 markets around @entity7 , starting in @entity66 and @entity67 before moving on to @entity68 ( pictured inset ) , @entity70 and @entity71 then returning home to @entity42 up to 300 passengers angry at a lack of information about the situation congregated to demand action only to be told by an officer that it was an illegal meeting and they should disperse			1
those on board said passengers began to fall ill on the first day of the cruise and it quickly mushroomed into an epidemic			1
more cleaners and two nurses are said to have gone on board to help and extra sick bags were placed in corridors			0
passenger @entity92 , 67 , a retired security officer from the @entity94 , said : ' it 's been a shambles from start to finish			0
passengers became ill almost immediately we set sail and the outbreak swept like wildfire throughout the ship			2
' feelings have been running high and people are pretty mutinous			0
' @entity14 has said only a tiny minority of the 1,843 passengers on board have become ill , but travellers have disputed this and say compensation claims will be launched			1
@entity15 , captained by @entity113 , has called at @entity114 , @entity67 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity68 and is due to return to @entity42 mr @entity92 added : ' at one stage there were dozens and dozens of people falling ill , though the ship 's senior officers were trying to play it down			0
' his wife @entity122 , 60 , a finance manager , said : ' a viral specialist who is a passenger told us the ship should not have set sail for 48 hours and should have gone through a thorough deep clean			0
' however we set sail the same day and as a result the health of everyone on board has been put at risk			2
it 's pretty outrageous , especially given there are some very elderly people on board			0
' another passenger said : ' they flew in extra cleaners to meet the ship in @entity70 and picked up two extra agency nurses in @entity67			0
they have put out extra sick bags			0
' in may this year around 170 passengers on board luxury cruise liner the @entity143 had their dream holidays ruined by sickness			1
the @entity149 owned ship was greeted by @entity152 staff and ambulance crews when it docked in @entity153 after a 13 - day tour of the @entity155 that was marred by a suspected norovirus outbreak			1
in february 3,000 passengers on board the @entity157 had their @entity161 trip cut short when the princess cruise liner was ordered back to port after the vomiting bug swept through the ship			1
just a week earlier two other princess cruise ships had been struck by the highly contagious illness , which causes nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea			1
@entity170 , 68 , a retired sales manager from @entity171 travelling with his wife @entity172 , said : ' all those who fell ill were quarantined to their cabins so it felt like a plague ship			0
people have been going round wearing masks			0
' passenger @entity180 said : ' it has been outrageous from start to finish			0
people were falling like flies , yet the crew were trying to insist everything was fine			0
@entity14 has a lot to answer for			0
this has n't been a pre-christmas treat			0
' the 62 - year - old retired accountant , who is travelling with his wife @entity192 , added : ' everyone is saying this a plague ship			2
it 's a living nightmare			0
' on its ten - day christmas market cruise @entity15 , captained by @entity113 , has called at @entity114 , @entity67 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity68 and is due to return to @entity42 tomorrow			1
tickets cost £ 1,429 for passengers in a balcony cabin , up to £ 949 for an ocean view outside cabin , and £ 799 for an inside cabin			1
carnival , @entity14 's parent company , said all medical expenses would be covered			0
a spokesman said : ' there has been an incidence of a mild gastrointestinal illness among the passengers on @entity15			2
' this illness is suspected to be norovirus , which is highly contagious and typically transmitted from person to person			2
' enhanced sanitation protocols have already been implemented to help minimize transmission to other passengers			0
' @entity220 , which will carry out a full inspection of @entity15 when it docks , said it believes 340 passengers have been affected by norovirus			1
the @entity15 passenger who died in 2009 was @entity226 , 67 , who was on a @entity18 ports cruise with her family when she became ill. she saw the ship 's doctor but died three days after disembarking at @entity42 .			1
