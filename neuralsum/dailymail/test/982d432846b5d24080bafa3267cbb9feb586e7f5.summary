@entity0 will resist any offers for left back @entity2			1
the 24 - year - old is fundamental to @entity5 's plans and was signed up to a five - year contract last summer			0
@entity7 have considered attack - minded @entity8 as they draw up an extensive list of potential homegrown signings ahead of the close season			2
@entity2 has attracted interest from @entity7 after a strong season with @entity0 @entity8 is strong going forward but shows off the defensive side of his game against @entity16 of @entity17 @entity0 though believe some new additions of their own in the summer can make them greater contenders for @entity23 football next season and do not intend to help their rivals			1
@entity5 is ready to sell some fringe players , but @entity8 is not one of them			0
@entity5 said : ' @entity2 has been the best @entity28 left back this season			1
i look at the stats and other players in his position			0
i also look at his performances , which have been great			0
but that 's my opinion			0
' @entity37 , a @entity38 , is @entity7 's regular left back in a squad short of homegrown players although @entity8 was been called up to the @entity43 squad last month he has yet to receive a full cap but has 29 at @entity46 level			1
@entity47 - born @entity8 had struggled to make an impression at @entity0 down the years but has benfited from @entity49 and @entity5 showing faith in him following a loan spell with @entity52 in 2012 - 13 .			2

@entity7 have *identified* @entity2 as a *transfer* *target*
@entity8 is a rising star and @entity7 's squad is short of homegrown players
but @entity59 boss @entity5 is a big *fan* of his left back
@entity0 will resist all summer offers for rose
