@entity0 was trying to act out the role of a film star when he went on his killing spree – to make up for the fact he felt like a failure in real life			1
clearly he did not feel he had the status he deserved			2
in his last @entity9 video , which he explicitly filmed to leave a legacy , he casts himself as a movie star			2
in another of his clips he appears to reference the film @entity14 , and it might be that he has taken the main character , @entity17 , as a role model			0
@entity14 follows anti-hero @entity17 , the son of a @entity21 banker , who mutilates and kills prostitutes after having sex with them @entity17 , played by @entity24 , is a successful @entity25 banker who picks up women and then butchers them after sex			0
the irony is that @entity24 ’s character is both sexually successful and a killer			1
' if you feel as if the whole world is against you , it makes it easier to start attacking random individuals ' but for @entity0 , his sexual frustration was the driving force behind the anger			1
however , both share deep feelings of sexual desire for women and aggression towards them			0
there are parallels between @entity0 and the @entity49 killers @entity47 and @entity47 , who fantasised about the idea that @entity51 would make a movie about their lives			1
some might think that because his father worked as an assistant director on @entity58 , which involves teens killing teens , that could have planted a seed in him to go on the rampage			1
but i think his father ’s success in @entity66 is more relevant , as it may have heightened his own feelings of inadequacy			0
@entity0 is the classic rampage killer : young , male , isolated and sexually frustrated			1
and he appeared to have a pronounced victim mentality			1
in his video he says things such as : ‘ you forced me to suffer all my life and now i ’ll make you all suffer			0
’ he blamed his suffering on others , and therefore felt his violence was righteous			0
it was a disturbed reality			0
' the irony is that @entity24 's character is both sexually successful and a killer			2
but for @entity0 , his sexual frustration was the driving force behind the anger ' he felt he was a victim of all of humanity			1
i think he was suicidal , and intended to kill himself after the shooting			0
if you feel as if the whole world is against you , it makes it easier to start attacking random individuals – and then kill yourself			0
dr @entity94 is professor of criminal justice studies at the @entity96 .			2

@entity0 , *22* , shot six *people* in @entity99 before killing himself
dr @entity101 says his profile fitted classic ' rampage killer '
@entity0 was young , isolated , sexually frustrated , and with victim mentality
