for those who feel the @entity2 is becoming too predictable at the top end , it is always worth hanging around for @entity4			0
there is a reason the @entity7 continue to chase leather in the cold while the rest of @entity11 holidays at this time of year and here , at a rather flabbergasted @entity13 , was it			2
two ahead at half - time after goals from @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity15 ’s team emerged for the second period aware that @entity20 had dropped two points at @entity22 and that a 10th successive win in all competitions would set a new club record and take to them to within a point of their great modern rivals			1
@entity30 ( third right ) fires home to complete an impressive comeback for strugglers @entity34 against second - placed @entity35 @entity34 's @entity30 ( centre ) celebrates wildly after equalising for his side against @entity35 at the @entity13 @entity30 wheels away in celebration with his team - mates , as @entity42 watches the shot hit the back of his @entity35 net @entity35 : @entity42 6 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 4.5 , @entity49 5 , @entity50 6 , @entity18 7 ( @entity51 88 , 5.5 ) , @entity52 6.5 , @entity17 7 , @entity53 5 ( @entity54 76 , 5.5 ) , @entity55 5.5 ( @entity56 62 , 5 ) subs not used : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 goals : @entity17 23 , @entity18 33 booked : @entity50 42 , @entity52 79 , @entity46 81 , @entity17 88 @entity34 : @entity63 6 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 6.5 , @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 , @entity68 6.5 , @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 6 , @entity71 6 , @entity72 7 , @entity30 7.5 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 goals : @entity68 47 , @entity30 81 booked : @entity67 71 referee : @entity83 @entity68 's first goal for @entity85 , to begin their comeback at the @entity13 , is shown by our impressive @entity87			1

less than an hour later , however , @entity35 were being booed off by their own supporters while @entity34 manager @entity93 was marching on to the field to congratulate his players			1
his team had not quite managed to pull off the victory of the @entity2 season so far but they had come strong at the champions to earn a point and prove that it is unwise to try to predict anything at this time of year			0
@entity15 — who ca n’t be much fun round the @entity4 dinner table — will try hard to ascertain how exactly this happened			0
he may wish to start with the fact that @entity34 looked fitter than his team			2
city have more players in their squad than @entity34 but it was the home side who were throwing on substitutes in a bid to find some energy and a spark during the second half			2
@entity34 , meanwhile , finished the game with the same 11 they started with			2
but the fact is that @entity35 looked leggy as the game became stretched and @entity34 who dominated possession for the entire five - minute period added on by referee @entity83			1
normally , we would have expected @entity35 to fly at @entity34 for the 15 minutes that were played after @entity30 equalised in the 81st minute , but during that time the home team had one chance , substitute @entity56 bringing a sharp , low save from @entity63			1
@entity34 finished the game comfortably and went home with a point they deserved			2
despite the fact they were two down at half - time , they had shown enough in the first 45 minutes to suggest they could hurt @entity35			1
as it transpired , that all proved rather portentous			0
@entity35 's @entity17 ( left ) scored the opening goal of the match on 23 minutes with a low left - footed shot @entity17 ( right ) watches on as he shoots through the @entity34 defence to open the scoring after spinning in the 18 - yard box in the first half @entity34 goalkeeper @entity63 can only watch as @entity17 's shot beats his despairing dive and goes into the net @entity35 led from the 23rd minute and were two ahead shortly after the half hour			1
they had been first to show and threatened early through central defender @entity47 , @entity53 and @entity55			0
interestingly , though , @entity34 centre forward @entity72 was already worrying @entity47 ’ partner @entity48 while @entity34 midfielder @entity143 had brought the first real save of the game from @entity35 goalkeeper @entity42			1
nevertheless , @entity35 broke through midway through the half			2
it was a neat goal from @entity17 , as he turned on to a @entity52 cross and shot low past @entity63 in the @entity34 goal			1
pretty soon @entity35 were two goals clear			0
this time @entity53 was the player who was in control of things on the edge of the penalty area and when he decided to shift the ball sideways to @entity18 the @entity156 stopped it , moved it a foot to his right and drove a perfect shot against the underside of the bar and into the goal			1
it was a magnificent strike and one that looked to have sealed the result			0
had @entity52 ’ subsequent low effort from 12 yards not been saved by @entity63 then we probably could have all gone home early			0
@entity17 ( centre ) is joined by his @entity35 team - mates in front of the home support after scoring to put his side 1 - 0 up against @entity34 @entity35 's players celebrate during their @entity2 match against @entity34 at the @entity13 @entity53 ( second left ) looks on as @entity18 ( right ) fires home from outside the area to double @entity35 's lead city boss @entity15 raises both fists in the air after the @entity156 international 's strike puts them 2 - 0 ahead on sunday as it was , @entity34 emerged for the second half to score a most peculiar goal and haul themselves back into things			1
there seemed little danger as @entity72 delivered a cross-shot from the left but the presence of @entity68 — who appeared to get a slight touch — seemed to confuse @entity42 , who could only dive over the ball and deflect it into the net			0
@entity15 subsequently claimed @entity68 had been offside , and he had a point			0
‘ maybe we deserve some luck , ’ smiled @entity93			0
from that point , the game began to disintegrate , as matches at this time of year often do			0
as legs tired , it became stretched and it has to be said that this seemed to suit @entity34 more than it did @entity35			2
@entity72 might have tested @entity42 had he not stood on the ball when played clear in the 54th minute , before central defender @entity66 headed over from a free - kick			0
a different angle shows @entity18 's shot fly towards @entity63 's goal , where it nestled in the top corner at the @entity13 @entity18 signals after scoring @entity35 's second goal of the day , while @entity34 's @entity143 has his hands on his hips @entity35 's @entity46 ( second right ) suffered a bloody cut to his forehead after accidentally clashing skulls with @entity48 ( centre ) @entity42 calls for medical assistance after @entity35 defender @entity46 suffers a head wound during the match @entity46 's @entity35 team - mates make sure he is okay after suffering a clash of heads with fellow defender @entity48 ( right ) @entity46 's on - field treatment included an injection into his forehead from the @entity35 medical team city , as you would expect , were still active as an attacking force and @entity53 brought a fingertip save from @entity63 with a low shot from the edge of the area			1
they were increasingly less than convincing , however , and , when it came , @entity34 ’s equaliser was not that surprising			0
@entity72 had already seen one shot fly wide and @entity30 had one of his own blocked by @entity47 before @entity35 found themselves pegged back with nine minutes left			1
a free - kick from deep was lofted into the area and when the two @entity35 central defenders could only knock it down , @entity30 connected with his right foot and lashed the ball past @entity42 with venom			1
this was something they had n’t expected			0
afterwards , @entity34 ’s @entity93 did n’t seem quite as surprised			0
@entity30 , scorer of @entity34 's equaliser nine minutes from time , brings the ball down to begin an attack for the @entity34 @entity64 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity53 during the @entity2 match between @entity35 and @entity34 on sunday former @entity259 man @entity68 spreads his arms wide in celebration after netting his side 's first goal at the @entity13 on sunday @entity68 ( left ) began the comeback for @entity34 when he scored past @entity42 in the @entity35 goal midway through the second half @entity18 ( centre ) brings the ball forward as he looks to take on @entity34 's @entity65 , who is on loan from @entity270 @entity15 gives instructions to @entity53 from his technical area at the side of the pitch at the @entity13 , as @entity35 looked to close the gap on the top @entity63 punches the air with delight after his side rescue a draw at the defending @entity2 champions @entity15 ( left ) looks dejected at the full - time whistle , while @entity34 manager @entity93 claps the travelling supporters ( right )			1

@entity35 are hot on the heels of leaders @entity20 , and went into the game just three points behind them
@entity17 opened the scoring in the first half when he spun in the 18 - yard box to fire past @entity34 's @entity63
shortly after , @entity18 doubled the lead with a brilliant strike into the top corner from outside the area
@entity68 *provided* a scare in the second half when he pulled a goal back for @entity34 to make it 2 - 1
the comeback was complete with nine minutes to go when @entity30 equalised for @entity34
