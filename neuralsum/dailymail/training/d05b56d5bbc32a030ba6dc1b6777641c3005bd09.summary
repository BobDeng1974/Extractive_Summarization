your camera could be about to get a lot smaller			0
researchers have succeeded in making one of the key components of cameras , the charge - coupled device ( ccd ) , just one atom thick			1
and they say it could be employed in ultra-thin two - dimensional imaging devices in the future			1
the new material developed at @entity21 shows promise for two - dimensional electronics , possibly paving the way to extremely thin cameras in the future the research , carried out by scientists at @entity29 in @entity30 , was published in the @entity32 journal @entity33			1
the two - dimensional three - pixel prototype traps electrons when light hits the material , and holds them until released for storage			2
and its composition , namely copper indium selenide ( @entity19 ) , apparently shows extraordinary promise for light detection			1
researchers this month revealed a new way to take pictures called compressed ultrafast photography			0
while current phone can take several shots a second at best , it is able to generate two - dimensional ( @entity52 ) colour images at up to 100 billion frames per second			2
the team at @entity55 in @entity56 , led by @entity57 , @entity58 , the @entity59 say the camera is the world 's fastest			0
@entity57 and his colleagues have made movies of the images they took with single laser shots of four physical phenomena : laser pulse reflection , refraction , faster - than light propagation of what is called non-information , and photon racing in two media			2
many modern digital cameras used an image sensor called a charge - coupled device ( ccd )			1
this fingernail - sized silicon chip contains millions of photosensitive diodes , which capture pixels for the photograph			0
the charge of each pixel is then converted into a series of numbers , creating a digital image of what the cameras has seen			2
decreasing the size of the ccd , however , could allow for much smaller cameras to be made			0
@entity92 , a graduate student involved in the study , said : ‘ traditional ccds are thick and rigid , and it would not make sense to combine them with 2 - d elements			1
‘ @entity19 - based ccds would be ultrathin , transparent and flexible , and are the missing piece for things like 2 - @entity103 imaging devices			1
' dr @entity104 , a senior faculty fellow in @entity21 ’s @entity105 and @entity106 , said @entity19 pixels are highly sensitive to light because the trapped electrons dissipate so slowly			1
' there are many two - dimensional materials that can sense light , but none are as efficient as this material , ' he said			0
' this material is 10 times more efficient than the best we ’ve seen before			0
' many modern digital cameras ( stock image shown ) used an image sensor called a charge - coupled device ( ccd )			1
this fingernail - sized silicon chip contains millions of photosensitive diodes , which capture pixels for the photograph			0
decreasing the size of the ccd , however , could allow for much smaller cameras to be made rice researchers fabricated a sensor array ( illustration shown ) to test the two - dimensional compound 's ability to capture image information			0
they started with a thin silicon substrate , fabricated three pairs of titanium / gold electrodes on top of the @entity19 and then cut the @entity19 into three sections with a focused ion beam because the material is transparent , a @entity19 - based scanner might use light from one side to illuminate the image on the other for capture			2
for medical applications , mr @entity92 envisions @entity19 being combined with other @entity52 electronics in tiny bio-imaging devices that monitor real - time conditions			1
in the experiments for the newly reported study , @entity92 and colleagues grew synthetic @entity19 crystals , pulled single - layer sheets from the crystals and then tested the ability of the layers to capture light			1
he said the layer was about two nanometers thick and consists of a nine - atom - thick lattice			0
the three - pixel prototype sensor based on @entity19 , a two - dimensional compound of copper , indium and selenium atoms , showed remarkable potential for its ability to capture and hold light in experiments at @entity21			1
the prototype ( shown ) was was about two nanometers thick and consists of a nine - atom - thick lattice			0
because it ’s flexible , @entity19 could also be curved to match the focal surface of an imaging lens system , perhaps like a camera			2
he said this would allow for the real - time correction of aberrations and significantly simplify the entire optical system .			0

@entity29 scientists in @entity30 create ultra-thin imaging device
called copper indium selenide ( @entity19 ) it is just one atom thick
but the material apparently has *enormous* light detection potential
it could be used to trap electrons and store images
@entity194 's @entity92 says this could allow for @entity52 imaging devices
this could , *ultimately* , make digital cameras much thinner
