scientists have identified a new species of ancient porpoise with a chin length unprecedented among known mammals			0
the unusual feature suggests that the animal used the tip of its face to probe the seabed for food			0
related to living crown porpoises , the extinct @entity12 had an extension of its jaw called a symphysis that measured 33in ( 85cm ) in the best - preserved specimen , researchers said			1
porpoises and dolphins are closely related within a family that also includes beluga and narwhal			2
the species lived roughly 1.5 to 5.3 million years ago along at least 450 kilometers of the @entity40 coast			2
@entity12 , had an extension of its jaw called a symphysis that measured 33in ( 85cm ) in the best - preserved specimen			1
the typical symphysis of a crown porpoise measures just half to one inch - long ( one to two cm )			1
scans reveal extensive nerve canals leading from the symphysis into the rear of the skull , indicating that the protuberance was highly sensitive and could relay meaningful information to the animal 's brain			1
the semirostrum was a benthic feeder - an animal that dug for food lodged in the seabed			0
modern porpoises seek food throughout the water column , preferring inshore , bottom - dwelling , and mid-water prey , including fish and cephalopods			0
' this is unique anatomy for a mammal , ' said @entity69 , the @entity70 doctoral candidate who is lead author of the paper about the research , published in the journal @entity74			0
' and it tells us that porpoises once searched for food in a very different way than they do now			0
' ms @entity69 and her colleagues analysed original fossils and ct scans of the best - preserved specimen , which she describes as ' almost completely preserved '			0
the scans reveal extensive nerve canals leading from the symphysis into the rear of the skull , indicating that the protuberance was highly sensitive and could relay meaningful information to the animal 's brain			1
the paper is the most thorough description ever of @entity12 and the first to make the case that the porpoise was a benthic feeder , or an animal that dug for food lodged in the seabed			1
modern porpoises seek food throughout the sea , preferring inshore , bottom - dwelling , and mid-water prey , including fish and octopuses			2
@entity12 is known from about 15 fossil specimens , all from @entity40 , including a remarkably well - preserved holotype specimen found at a construction site in @entity109			1
the species lived roughly 1.5 to 5.3 million years ago along at least 280 miles ( 450km ) of the @entity40 coast			2
the study is the most thorough description ever of @entity12 ( illustration , pictured ) and the first to make the case that the porpoise was a benthic feeder , or an animal that dug for food lodged in the seabed the name @entity12 refers to the animal 's unusual jaw â€” the rostrum is the lower half of the jaw			1
the closest jaw structure in living animals is found in birds known as skimmers and in half - beak fish			0
as @entity134 hunt for food , they fly just above the surface of water bodies with their symphysis slightly submerged to probe and scoop small fish and crustaceans			0
both skimmers and half - beak fish feed mainly at night , suggesting the importance to them of highly sensitive probes that can relay through touch information about unseen prey			1
the unusual feature suggests that the animal ( artist 's impression , pictured ) used the tip of its face to probe the seabed for food			0

related to living crown porpoises , the extinct @entity40 porpoise , @entity12 , had an extension of its jaw called a symphysis
the *growth* was 33in ( 85cm ) long and probed the sea bed
