tied up with ropes and a mish - mash of planks , a grinning scout dangles precariously off the ground as his companions heave him up the wall			2

these photographs , taken between the 1930s and 1950s , shows scouts certainly knew how to have fun in the old days in another shot , a scout perches on top of an alarmingly rickety tower , cobbled together from wooden poles , while a boy clambers his way up the nostalgic snaps are a world away from today 's ' cotton wool ' generation who are cosseted by parents and coddled by safety concerns it ’s enough to give the average health and safety officer a seizure			1
but this is the sort of fun that scouts used to get up to in the days when a spirit of adventure was unfettered by red tape			1
the photographs , taken between the 1930s and 1950s , were unearthed to mark the centenary celebrations of a scout group in @entity46 , @entity47 , and are a world away from today ’s ‘ cotton wool ’ generation who are cosseted by parents and coddled by safety concerns			1
there was nothing to hold back the 3rd @entity56 group , based at @entity57 , when it was founded 100 years ago today			1
a young scout dangles from an improvised rope bridge , which looks a lot like a plank attached to some lengths of rope a young man with a pretend leg injury is hauled up a school building in a makeshift splint			0
while it certainly looks fun , it probably would not pass current health and safety legislation assistant district commissioner @entity71 , 73 , who has been involved with the group for 60 years , admitted times had changed but insisted @entity74 today remained just as fun as in 1913			1
‘ the leaders of old had fewer restrictions imposed on them with health and safety , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve learned to manage the risks , but it ’s fair to say we are more safety - conscious than we used to be			0
however , that does n’t stop us offering adventurous activities			0
’ he said today ’s children often needed encouragement to enjoy the delights of outdoor life and camping			2
@entity91 who documented the scout troop in photographs			0
known as @entity94 , he died in 2004 ‘ youngsters these days tend to have less patience than we did and it is a bit of a culture shock for some to be introduced to a tea towel when they have never known life without a dishwasher , but they soon get into the swing of things			0
’ a @entity107 spokesman said the shot of the boy being rescued was not necessarily relegated to the past			0
he added : ‘ these casualty rescue skills are still practised today , if not necessarily from the side of a building			2

snaps taken between 1930s and 1950s , show how much fun scouts had
they were unearthed by the 3rd @entity56 group
pictures seem a world away from the *sanitised* fun had by today 's scouts
