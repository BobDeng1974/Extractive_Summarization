by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 06:46 est , 15 january 2014 one in five obese adults would rather be fat than have to watch what they eat , new research has revealed			2
some 17 per cent also say they have never attempted to lose weight and 48 per cent are resigned to remaining obese because they lack the willpower to diet			1
@entity11 surveyed 550 obese people and asked them about their attitudes towards exercise and weight loss			2
a quarter said they do not have time to exercise and 40 per cent claimed to find exercise boring			1
a new survey has revealed that one in five obese @entity21 adults would rather remain overweight than have to watch what they eat - some 17 per cent also say they have never attempted to lose weight shockingly , one in seven said they would rather risk their healthy by being overweight than have to do exercise			1
the news comes just the day after @entity27 said that fat people have only themselves to blame for their obesity if they insist on ' stuffing themselves silly '			1
the former @entity31 chairman said people ’s ‘ stupid actions ’ in eating ‘ rubbish ’ foods all day was behind the rise in obesity			0
he was cheered in the @entity37 when he told peers that rather than setting up government initiatives to persuade people to eat more healthily , ministers should simply tell them that weight is a matter of individual responsibility			2
former employment secretary @entity27 said : ‘ people ought to know that if they stuff themselves silly with high - calorie rubbish foods , they will get fat			1
‘ it ’s their responsibility and all the forums and other nonsenses are merely trying to divorce people from the consequences of their own stupid actions			0
’ the researchers also polled 3,100 adults in @entity21 who were of varying weights			0
they discovered that 39 per cent of people claim not to eat healthily because it is too expensive to do so			1
a quarter of obese people say they do not have time to exercise and 40 per cent claim to find exercise boring they also learned that 14 per cent of people think they lack the time to prepare healthy food and 10 per cent say they do not know how to eat healthily			1
as a result , it is little surprise that 40 per cent of people say seeing obese adults in the area they live in is common , and 38 per cent say childhood obesity is the norm			2
while a lot of people appear to feel unable to resolve their weight problems , many have suggestions as to what could be done to help them			1
of the people surveyed , 45 per cent said gp referrals for exercise should be considered and 40 per cent said they would like to see increased funding for recognised weight management programmes			2
some 43 per cent want stricter regulations on ‘ unhealthy ’ food and drink chains sponsoring high profile events and 40 per cent said school meals should be regulated			0
while the majority of respondents - 81 per cent - said obesity is the fault of the individual , when questioned about contributing factors to the @entity21 ’s obesity epidemic , more than half - 55 per cent - said the blame lies with the food industry			2
dr @entity104 , @entity105 and medical director of wellbeing at @entity11 , said : ‘ if you are struggling financially , a cut - price fast food offer might seem like the best value option , but it is disappointing to see so many people are falling for this myth			0
‘ there is clearly a huge amount of work to be done to persuade people that the cheapest food can actually be the healthiest food			0
‘ that people would rather be overweight than eat healthily also needs to be addressed , because the repercussions of children and young adults growing up within this mind - set will be a tragedy			1
‘ when such high numbers are reporting childhood obesity as the norm in their towns and cities means we ’re already playing catch - up if we are to help these children and young adults avoid a life of obesity and related ill health			0
’ the results of the poll come just the day after @entity27 claimed overweight people have only themselves to blame for their weight if they ' stuff themselves silly ' @entity139 , @entity140 at @entity11 , said : ‘ people who are trapped in the rut that is obesity need to take a step back and really think about the food they are eating			1
‘ as a nation , if we continue in this way we are heading for not only an obese population of children and adults , but a chronically ill population			0
‘ the key to success is not just dieting , it is long - term lifestyle changes that people need to adopt and which will only work if taken in small steps over a long period of time			0
‘ eating more fruit and vegetables , cutting down on takeaways , or eating food in its natural state , rather than covered in rich sauces , will drastically reduce the amount of fat and sugar we eat			0
‘ increasing day - to - day activity , walking up the stairs instead of taking the lift , walking those short distances instead of taking the car , going for a walk around the block in the evening , will all contribute to a healthier lifestyle , which once adopted will become much easier to maintain over time			0
