by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 11:07 est , 11 november 2013 daisy the dog is a pet her owner simply ca n't live without			2
that 's because the lovable four - year - old has repeatedly saved @entity8 's life , something she puts down to the pet 's ' psychic ' powers			1
miss @entity8 , 60 , claims to have avoided serious injury twice after @entity13 warned of impending danger			1
according to @entity15 , @entity13 also barks instinctively seconds before the phone rings and can even tell when her owner is about to get out of her seat by offering up her paw			1
life - saver : @entity8 ( pictured ) , from @entity20 , says her ' mystic ' pet @entity13 ( right ) can warn her of impending danger miss @entity8 said the little cockerpoo - a cocker spaniel poodle cross - has already predicted a car crash and a potentially lethal accident in her master 's bathroom			1
@entity13 first showed an ability to foresee danger in february this year when she became agitated and started howling while @entity8 was driving			1
miss @entity8 slowed down and just minutes later , a fellow driver ploughed into the back of her car as it pulled out of a junction and sent the motor hurtling into a wall			1
incredibly , miss @entity8 escaped serious injury because she had slowed down as a result of @entity13 's barking			1
on another occasion , @entity13 started to run round @entity8 's apartment in @entity20 at 4am - just hours before a shower screen shattered in her bathroom			1
shop owner @entity15 , who is not married and lives on her own , said : ' a few sundays ago i went to bed as normal , but at 4am @entity13 suddenly awoke and began rushing round my apartment - nothing seemed to quieten her			2
adorable : four - year - old @entity13 has helped @entity8 , 60 , avoid serious injury twice ' after about half an hour i persuaded her to come back into the bedroom where she jumped up on the bed and lay horizontally next to me , pushing her little body against mine			1
' two hours later there was a huge explosion in the bathroom			0
my glass shower door had exploded and sent pieces of glass everywhere - they 'd even gone flying out into the hallway			0
' just before it happened @entity13 would n't leave my side , she would n't let me go , she just wanted me to stay there			2
' psychic ' dog @entity13 ( pictured ) who barked loudly to wake her owner @entity8 just before the glass on her shower smashed miss @entity8 said the little cockerpoo - a cocker spaniel poodle cross - has already predicted a car crash and a potentially lethal accident in her master 's bathroom ' maybe she heard the glass cracking first , i did n't know what was going to happen but she seemed to sense something and wanted to protect me			1
' if it had happened two hours later when i usually have a shower i would , without a doubt , have been very badly injured			0
' the first time i noticed @entity13 's sixth sense was back in february , when i was driving and she started getting agitated , i got quite cross with her making such a fuss			2
' then a few minutes later a man went into the back of me and sent my car flying into a wall - it was a complete write - off			0
luckily neither of us was hurt , although @entity13 was very shaken			0
' it could have been much worse but because i 'd slowed down to calm @entity13 we were n't going that fast at the time of the impact			0
' she 's normally a very placid dog so it 's very out - of - character for her to get agitated and howl			0
' whenever she does it in future i might just lock myself away because i 'll know something bad is on the way			0
i strongly believe @entity13 has psychic powers			0
there is really no other explanation for it			0
' miss @entity8 believes her close bond with @entity13 , who she got as a ten - week - old puppy , allows her to interpret signals from her dog			1
the inseparable pair spend most of the day together , and @entity13 even meets and greets customers at her master 's boutique in @entity112			0
@entity13 has another unusual talent - picking up litter when she goes for her daily walk by the canal			2
miss @entity8 added : ' i think she saw me always picking the rubbish up and picked up the habit herself			2
she 's an amazing little dog , she 's like a little child really			0
