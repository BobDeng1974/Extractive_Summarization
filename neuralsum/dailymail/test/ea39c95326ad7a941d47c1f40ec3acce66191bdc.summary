being underweight in mid-life could increase your risk of dementia , claim researchers			1
a new study shows you are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as @entity7 's than those of a healthy weight			1
obese people appear to be protected against dementia , with a risk around 30 per cent lower than those of healthy weight			1
the findings contradict many previous studies which have suggested that being fat – with a high @entity16 ( @entity16 ) - could raise the risk			0
a new study shows underweight people are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as @entity7 's than those of a healthy weight ( file photo ) study author , professor @entity24 , from the @entity25 , said doctors and policymakers may have to re-think how to best identify those at high risk of dementia			1
he said ' we also need to pay attention to the causes and public health consequences of the link between underweight and increased dementia risk which our research has established			1
' ' however , our results also open up an intriguing new avenue in the search for protective factors for dementia - if we can understand why people with a high @entity16 have a reduced risk of dementia , it 's possible that further down the line , researchers might be able to use these insights to develop new treatments for dementia			1
' other experts said more research was needed , and the way @entity55 used to diagnose dementia may have skewed the results			1
researchers based at the @entity25 and @entity58 , also in @entity59 , analysed patient information recorded during routine general practice over nearly two decades			2
data on 1,958,191 patients aged 55 on average with a @entity16 of 26.5 on average - just within the range usually classed as overweight - were examined			0
@entity16 is assessed by comparing height to weight , in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared			0
a healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 – above is overweight and obese			1
the study regarded @entity16 of less than 20 as underweight			2
after nine years follow - up , 45,507 people were diagnosed with dementia			1
researchers found people who were underweight in middle age were 34 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those of a healthy weight			1
the findings contradict many previous studies which have suggested that being fat – with a high @entity16 ( @entity16 ) - could raise the risk ( file photo ) as people 's @entity16 increased , the risk of dementia fell , with very obese people having a @entity16 greater than 40 less likely to develop the condition than those of normal weight			1
the link was not affected by the decade in which patients were born , age at diagnosis , alcohol use or smoking			0
the new research was published in @entity99 ( must credit )			0
dr @entity100 , from @entity58 in @entity59 , said the reasons why high @entity16 might lead to a lower risk of dementia are not clear			2
' many different issues related to diet , exercise , frailty , genetic factors and weight change could play a part ' he said			0
prof @entity111 , professor of @entity112 , @entity113 , said limitations of the study included poor dementia diagnosis rates by @entity55 at the time			2
he said ' it is plausible that faced with a grossly obese patient , the average @entity119 may have concentrated on the obvious medical risks and paid less attention to the cognitive issues than they might have done with a comparable patient of normal weight			2
' or maybe the gp did n't refer them to a memory clinic but sent them to see a gastroenterologist or diabetologist instead			0
' in other words , the study may be telling us something about the diagnostic practices of @entity55 , as much about the natural history of metabolic disease and dementia			0
' dr @entity139 , director of research and development at @entity141 , said ' previous research has suggested that being overweight in midlife increases risk of developing the condition and yet this study suggests that it may actually be protective			0
' this mixed picture highlights the difficulty of conducting studies into the complex lifestyle risk factors for dementia and reinforces the need for further research			0
dr @entity153 , @entity154 at @entity155 , said ' there is currently no sure - fire way to prevent dementia			0
' in the meantime , evidence suggests that we can reduce the risk by eating a healthy , balanced diet , exercising regularly , not smoking , and keeping blood pressure in check .			0

underweight people are also more likely to be diagnosed with @entity7
obese person is 30 per cent less likely to get dementia than healthy person
this could help *scientists* develop new treatments , researchers have said
