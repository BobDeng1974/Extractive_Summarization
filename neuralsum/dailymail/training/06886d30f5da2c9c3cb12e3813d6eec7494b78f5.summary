apparently driven by the incredible levels of competition in the @entity3 job market , young students and graduates believe that a curved , @entity21 style nose will give them that @entity22 needed to secure a career			1
hundreds of advertisements are currently displayed across the south - western city of @entity28 , with posters promoting surgeon @entity31 's ' @entity7 ' procedure , @entity25 reports			1
the poster shows a pale @entity21 - looking woman showing off her slender , sloping nose in profile against a silhouette of the famous @entity39 landmark			0
despite the 7,400 euro ( about £ 6,100 ) cost of the operation - and the rather unpalatable fact that the nose is made larger using tissue from the forehead - demand is apparently high			1
surgeon @entity31 said of his procedure : ' we are influenced by the beauty of @entity7 , we are not content to just add something to the nose , we reconstruct it			2
' some students face a lot of employment pressure after graduation , if their facial features are good , they 'll have more chance of finding a job			0
‘ we 've had students getting the @entity59 , it 's helped them a lot			0

the poster advertising an ' @entity7 ' nose operation at a clinic in the southwest @entity3 city of @entity28 the popularity of surgery in @entity80 , particularly among the young , has been blamed by some on a desire to look more ' western ' fuelled by an obsession with celebrity culture			1
@entity85 is the world 's largest market for plastic surgery , with one in five @entity90 women having gone under the knife			0
recently a procedure similar in its extreme nature to the ‘ @entity7 nose ’ has hit headlines when an unnamed woman , allegedly a reporter on a @entity85 tv channel , underwent jaw surgery in order to achieve the dainty heart - shaped face desired by many east @entity80 women			2
graduates in @entity3 feel that looking a certain way will help them get ahead in the increasingly competitive job market before and after : the @entity85 woman looks drastically different after undergoing plastic surgery to make her jaw more heart shaped it is usually a last resort solution to correct facial deformities where people have been unable to chew properly due to an excessive over or underbite , but has become popular in @entity85			1
other worrying trends have seen leg lengthening and eye - widening procedures sweep some @entity80 countries as a @entity21 look is continued to be highly prized .			0
