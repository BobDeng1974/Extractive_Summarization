the @entity1 is paralysed by a @entity3 - style code of silence that stops whistleblowers highlighting poor care , mps were told last night			1
even senior surgeons fear drawing attention to dangers to patients in case it should damage their career			1
@entity13 , the chairman of the @entity15 watchdog , said there was a ‘ chilling ’ culture in @entity1 hospitals that discouraged potential whistleblowers from breaking ranks			1
concern : @entity13 , the chairman of the @entity15 , told the @entity24 health select committee there was a ' chilling ' culture in @entity1 hospitals that discouraged potential whistleblowers from breaking ranks medics who wish to expose failing hospitals have to be ‘ very , very brave ’ , he told a @entity24 committee			1
he said senior doctors ’ career prospects had been ruined after they dared to speak out			1
there have been a series of scandals involving whistleblowers whose concerns were covered up by an @entity1 keen to sweep poor care under the carpet			1
campaigner @entity40 was ignored when she campaigned about poor standards at @entity42 , where up to 1,200 died needlessly from neglect in appalling conditions			0
hundreds of former @entity1 staff are under gagging orders to ensure they did not speak out about poor care			1
highlighting the need to break down the @entity1 ’s ‘ tribal ’ culture of banning criticism , mr prior told the @entity24 health select committee : ‘ i have spoken to a couple of surgeons whose careers have been severely limited because they expressed concerns about what was going on at their hospitals			1
’ he said he had found it ‘ chilling ’ to hear a senior clinician ask why doctors did not raise concerns about unusually high mortality rates and poor care of patients at the @entity65			1
previous stories : the @entity67 revealed last month that @entity1 bosses have spent £ 4million in three years secretly gagging whistleblowers concerned about patient care ‘ for years , this dreadful care went on and no doctor put his head above the parapet , ’ he said			1
‘ why is that ? one part of the answer is that they are frightened			0
‘ even if you are an alpha - male surgeon , you are frightened			0
we might feel that ’s not good enough , but that is the situation			0
’ ' for years , this dreadful care went on and no doctor put his head above the parapet			0
why is that ? one part of the answer is that they are frightened ' @entity13 , @entity15 chairman committee member @entity89 said @entity1 trusts operated under ‘ omerta ’ – the @entity3 ’s code of silence , adding : ‘ it is about organisations closing ranks so tightly that if anyone steps out of line they are finished			1
‘ it is a kind of @entity3 code , an omerta , where you do anything against the status quo of the organisation and you are finished			0
that is something that surely needs to be broken			0
’ @entity108 , of the pressure group @entity109 , said : ‘ if you are an innocent patient you will be scared by this			0
‘ it is horrific to think that doctors know of problems but can not speak out			2
we only hear about it when there is a big case like @entity42 , but now it seems it is more widespread			0
’ the @entity67 revealed last month that @entity1 bosses have spent £ 4million in three years secretly gagging whistleblowers concerned about patient care			1
making herself heard : campaigner @entity40 ( pictured with prime minister @entity122 ) was ignored when she campaigned about poor standards at @entity42 , where up to 1,200 died needlessly dozens of doctors , nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out			2
one of them was @entity131 , former boss of @entity132 , who was given £ 500,000 to leave quietly after repeatedly warning that targets were being put ahead of patients			2
he received the hush money to prevent him going public with his fears that the ‘ target culture ’ at the trust could cost lives			2
' it is a kind of @entity3 code , an omerta , where you do anything against the status quo of the organisation and you are finished			0
that is something that surely needs to be broken ' @entity89 , @entity24 health select committee member as many as 500 patients may have died needlessly because of poor care – but his concerns were ignored , and he said he was ‘ thrown to the wolves ’ for speaking out			2
the new leadership of the @entity15 want to make it easier for doctors and nurses to trigger inspections of their hospitals by coming to them with concerns about patient safety			1
mr prior and chief executive @entity161 were appointed within the past year to lead a shake - up of the @entity15 after it came in for harsh criticism over its response to scandals including @entity168 and @entity169 , where babies died needlessly in maternity units			1
they told @entity173 they were bringing in a new regime of specialist inspections of hospitals , care homes and surgeries , which will eventually see ratings published not only for each service but also for individual departments within hospitals			2
mr prior said : ‘ how we enable people to raise concerns with us at a much earlier stage in confidence is incredibly important			0
answering questions : mr prior ( left ) and chief executive @entity161 ( right ) were appointed within the past year to lead a shake - up of the @entity15 after it came in for harsh criticism over its response to scandals ‘ we need to get a continuous flow of information from staff and residents and patients and carers			1
that ’s our best source of information			0
‘ what we have got to do is to be absolutely sure when we do an inspection that hospitals have got proper whistleblowing , concern - raising , procedures within the hospital and that there is real clinical engagement			0
‘ and we have got to be a safety net and be available to these people at a much earlier stage so they can ring us up , get in touch with us and that can precipitate an inspection			0
’ mr prior acknowledged that the @entity15 ’s new inspection regime was ‘ a work in progress ’ , but said the first 18 inspections would be completed by @entity224 , with reports published by february			1
he and mr @entity161 were challenged over their decision to clear head of media @entity229 of wrongdoing over a report into the watchdog ’s handling of complaints about maternity unit deaths at @entity169			0
an independent report suggested miss @entity229 was involved in preventing the publication of the results of an internal inquiry because of fears it would damage the watchdog ’s reputation			0
but mr prior insisted the report had not come to the conclusion that any individual was guilty			0
a @entity250 spokesman said : ‘ @entity250 supports protection for whistleblowers in the @entity1			2
but this government needs to do more to support frontline @entity1 staff			2
