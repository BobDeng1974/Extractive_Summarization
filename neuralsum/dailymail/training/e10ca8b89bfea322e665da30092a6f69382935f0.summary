by @entity1 reporter published : 19:40 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 18 november 2013 breakthrough : engineers say the speed which steam is funnelled through the spout is why a kettle whistles when you finally get home after a hard day ’s work , the whistle of a stove - top kettle can be a truly comforting sound			1
until now , scientists have been unable to explain what makes the noise			0
but a group of @entity20 researchers say they have found the reason – and it ’s to do with the speed steam is funnelled through the spout when you ’re making that all - important brew			1
they explained that as a kettle boils , the air moves faster and wobbles when it travels through the narrowest part of the spout			1
then as the steam escapes it creates tiny ‘ vortices ’ – whirlwind - like eddies that can produce sound at certain frequencies			1
although the finding might sound trivial , it could help solve other problems			0
researcher @entity40 said : ‘ pipes and vehicle exhausts are classic examples			0
‘ once we know where the whistle is coming from , we can potentially get rid of it			0
’ results show that as the kettle starts to boil , the whistle behaves like a @entity51 resonator - the same mechanism that causes an empty bottle to hum when you blow over the neck			0
however , above a particular flow speed , the sound is instead produced by small vortices - regions of swirling flow - which , at certain frequencies , can produce noise			1
the study tested a series of simplified kettle whistles in an apparatus by forcing air through them at various speeds			0
the resulting sound produced by rushing air was recorded , the frequency and amplitude data of the sound were plotted , then analysed to identify trends			2
a two - microphone technique was also used to determine frequency inside the spout			0
vortex production starts as steam comes up the kettle ’s spout and meets a hole at the start of the whistle , which is much narrower than the spout itself			2
this contracts the flow of steam as it enters the whistle and creates a jet of steam passing through it			2
@entity92 : researchers at @entity20 said the finding could solve problems with exhausts			1

the speed steam is funnelled through the spout is why it makes a sound
@entity20 researchers say air wobbles when the water is boiled
as the steam escapes , it creates noises at certain frequencies
