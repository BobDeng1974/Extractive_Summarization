the mass stranding of 160 melon - headed whales on two beaches in @entity3 has triggered fears of upcoming earthquake and tsunami			1
the whales , which are in fact a species of dolphin , were found washed up along a 6 - mile ( 10km ) stretch of the @entity12 of @entity13 , around 60 miles ( 100km ) north of @entity14			1
although officials are still investigating the cause of the strandings , they triggered rumours on social media of an impending earthquake			1
however , experts have dismissed the claims as being ' unscientific '			1
for centuries there have been accounts of animals behaving bizarrely before earthquakes			0
now scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short - term seismic forecasting			2
they found that animals in @entity44 - such as pumas and razor - billed curassow birds - ran for cover days before the event			1
researchers believe that the changes in behaviour may be linked to airborne ions			0
led by dr @entity53 of @entity54 , experts used data gathered from a series of motion - triggered cameras located in the @entity58 in @entity44			2
the research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 @entity64 earthquake that struck the region in 2011			2
on a typical day , the cameras would record between five and 15 animal sightings			0
however , within the two - day period in the run - up to the earthquake , they recorded five or fewer sightings			2
instead they believe the melon - headed whales may have suffered a parasitic infection			1
others believe the sandy shoals around @entity77 may have also made the animal 's sonar ineffective			0
@entity80 , head of @entity81 at @entity3 's @entity82 of @entity83 , said while it was possible the whales frightened by disturbances in the @entity89 's electromagnetic field caused by movement in the tectonic plates - there were was no firm evidence of this			1
speaking to the @entity94 he said : ' this area of @entity3 has had many similar cases of beachings in the past , and especially of this species , so we are trying to find out why it happens			2
' he added that the animals , which measure two to three metres in length , could have been trying to avoid predators like killer whales and come too close to the shore			1
however , despite attempts to reassure the public , social media sites like @entity107 have been ablaze with rumours of an impending earthquake			1
one @entity107 user wrote : ' is the next one coming ? be ready for a quake			0
' the whales first began to appear on the beach last week but officials said they had discovered eight more bodies today			2
local residents had rushed to the beaches with buckets and towels in an attempt to help keep the marine mammals alive			0
scientists are still investigating what caused the whales to become stranded on the beaches of @entity25 city local resident used buckets of water in an attempt to keep the melon - headed whales alive on the beaches officials have spent the weekend removing and buring the dead melon - headed whales after they stranded however , almost all of the animals have now died although a few were returned to the ocean			1
the strandings in 2011 before the magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of @entity3 is not the first association of whale strandings with tectonic activity			1
around 100 pilot whales died in a mass stranding on a remote beach in @entity151 just two days before a large earthquake hit @entity153 in 2011			1
the 2004 @entity155 earthquake in the @entity156 that also triggered a devastating tsunami also saw 170 whales stranded on beaches in @entity160 and @entity151 in the days before			2
those whales that survived were taken back out to sea by the @entity163 to return them to the ocean @entity163 personnel managed to return some of the whales back to the sea the whales were stranded on two beaches close to @entity25 around 60 miles north of @entity14 according to the @entity172 , which monitors tremors around the world , there was a small magnitude 5.3 earthquake 157 miles ( 252km ) off the coast of @entity178 , @entity3			1
quakes of this size are relatively common along the fault line			0
however , researchers have found it is possible detect tiny pulses in the @entity89 's magnetic field in the areas around the epicentre of earthquakes in the weeks before they occur			0
researchers at @entity190 have been developing new techniques to use these pulses to predict earthquakes using highly sensitive magnetometres			0
however , it is not know if whales have the ability to detect such tiny fluctuations			0
@entity198 , a senior researcher at the @entity199 , said investigations were still ongoing into what caused the whales to strand in @entity13			2
he told public broadcaster @entity204 : ' we do n't see any immediate signs of diseases on their bodies , such as cancer			0
' we want to figure out what killed these animals			0
' residents struggled to return the whales to the sea after the mammals became exhausted in the shallow water once stranded , the animals are vulnerable to dehydration and sunburn until rescuers can use the high tide to move their massive weight back into deeper water			0
efforts to save the dolphins stood in marked contrast to the global view of @entity3 and its relationship with cetaceans			0
despite international opprobrium , @entity3 hunts minke and pilot whales off its coast , and has for many years also pursued the mammals in the @entity235 , where it takes advantage of a scientific exemption to an international moratorium on whaling			1
it has never made a secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed			0
a @entity246 court ruled last year that the @entity235 hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as research , prompting @entity14 to suspend operations , but it vowed to redesign the programme to make it more scientific			0
the @entity254 's ( @entity254 ) panel of experts said today that it opposed @entity3 's proposal for its scientific research whaling programme , saying it did not demonstrate a need for killing whales .			1

the whales washed up along a 6 mile stretch of coast near @entity13 , @entity3
experts have dismissed rumours of impending earthquake as unscientific
the strandings sparked *comparisons* with the appearance of 50 melon - headed whales six days before the earthquake in 2011 that left 19,000 dead
officials instead believe the whales may have suffered a parasitic infection while others say the animals may have been attempting to avoid predators
