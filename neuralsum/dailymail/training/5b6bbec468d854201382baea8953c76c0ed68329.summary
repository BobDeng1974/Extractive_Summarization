the views are breathtaking but it hardly seems to be the safest place to sit at the best of times			0
yet these walkers dangling their legs over a drop of several hundred feet do n’t seem to mind the added risk – a huge crack in the cliff edge			1
and the holidaymakers on the beach seem oblivious to the dangers , too			0
for the cliffs at @entity15 , near @entity16 , @entity17 , are known to be crumbling			1
however walkers seem content to ignore warnings in place as they dangle their feet off the top vast chunks have regularly fallen and the 30ft - long crack in the pictures appeared earlier this year , after winter storms caused seven years ’ worth of erosion in only two months			1
however that was n’t putting off the many visitors enjoying the sunshine this week who were more than happy to sit near – or under – the crack			2
one onlooker said : ‘ bits of these cliffs regularly fall off , and i could n’t believe people ’s devil - may - care attitude			2
‘ they did n’t seem to realise that the ground beneath them could just disappear in a second			0
it ’s very high up and they were brazen sitting next to these massive cracks in the ground			0
’ walkers along the beach are content to stroll underneath the giant chalk cliffs , despite the fact that they could fall down on top of them at any moment			1

walkers pictured sitting along top of cliffs at @entity15 , @entity16

cliffs have seen seven years ' of erosion in six months thanks to storms
