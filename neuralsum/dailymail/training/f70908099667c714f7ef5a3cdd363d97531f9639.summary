@entity2 council staff seized and destroyed damning evidence of a hidden child sex abuse scandal , reports claim			1
the alleged cover - up has been reported just days after it emerged the abuse of 1,400 girls went uninvestigated for 16 years			0
officials are said to have ordered a raid on the town 's young people 's service centre and seized nothing but the details of victims , offenders , and grooming cases that would have contributed to a landmark report in 2000 , the @entity8 reported			1
the allegations will pile pressure on officials including embattled children ’s services chief @entity32 , who was still refusing to resign last night despite mounting evidence of her extraordinary complacency during a period of horrific and widespread child abuse			1
just five months ago she insisted that ‘ a sense of proportionality ’ was needed about the problem			1
even after several critical reports into the council ’s failure to deal with child abuse , mrs @entity32 told the @entity45 that she did not want it to focus entirely on child abuse			1
minutes of a meeting in march this year show she ‘ reiterated ’ that the council , social services and police ‘ need to retain a sense of proportionality with regard to child sexual exploitation ’			1
mrs @entity32 , who earns £ 115,000 a year , said the issue made up just ‘ 2.3 per cent of safeguarding work in @entity2 ’ , adding : ‘ although it is a very important issue , child neglect is a much more significant problem in the borough			2
’ professor @entity61 ’s report said : ‘ this is not an appropriate message for senior managers to give			0
’ defiant response : @entity32 told a meeting that agencies need to ' retain a sense of proportionality ' with regards to the widespread sex abuse scandal in @entity2 that spanned 16 years but in a defiant statement last night , mrs @entity32 said the report found the council made ‘ clear and significant improvements ’ under her leadership			1
she said : ‘ like most people , i feel appalled at the horrific experiences which many of our young people went through , and i add my sincere apologies to those who were let down by our services ... it lays bare what went wrong , and there are simply no excuses			0
‘ these are very difficult times and we need all of the experience and ability we can bring to bear			0
‘ the best way i can exercise my responsibility is to drive forward the report ’s recommendations , and make sure young people in @entity2 are even safer			0
’ mrs @entity32 ’s predecessor , @entity97 , yesterday admitted most senior staff would have known of the scale of the abuse			2
dr @entity97 , who now works in @entity101 , said she was briefed when she joined the authority in 2005			0
she said : ‘ we knew there were many children in the community at risk and feared that this was the tip of an iceberg			0
’ she admitted the predominant view had been that abuse victims were ‘ promiscuous teenagers in consensual relationships ’			2
the @entity114 has criticised mrs @entity32 for viewing prosecution of rapists as a ‘ secondary ’ priority – which it found was partly to blame for an abysmal lack of convictions			0
@entity121 , chief executive of @entity122 , last night refused to sack mrs @entity32			2
he said : ‘ @entity61 has made it very clear to me in her report that @entity32 is part of the solution in achieving better services			1
