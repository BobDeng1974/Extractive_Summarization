tuition , sporting and curricula fees for @entity3 's college , one of @entity15 's most prestigious schools , reportedly top $ 30,000 the @entity16 have been running a 17 - week diploma for @entity19 students at @entity3 's college to skip their year 12 exams and ' buy ' their entry into the sandstone university			1
' access to university should be fair and equitable , ' mr @entity0 told @entity25			0
' any scheme that gives some students an unfair advantage is unacceptable and i will be discussing this with the federal government , which is responsible for universities			0
' eight @entity3 's students gained ' direct entry ' to the university after completing the program in 2014 , according to a letter sent to parents by principal dr @entity39 , while 166 students completed the @entity8			1
the program was devised by the university 's commercial arm , @entity44 , and students who completed the course successfully were guaranteed places in a number of undergraduate level courses , including bachelor degrees in health sciences , liberal arts and science , animal and veterinary bioscience , visual arts , music and oral health , or in a diploma of law			2
opposition leader @entity61 is concerned over how this alternative would impact the @entity8			2
