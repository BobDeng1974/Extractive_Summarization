by @entity0 published : 21:13 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 05:06 est , 22 february 2013 little more than ten years ago , they were barely known and barely used			0
the only people who really knew of their existence were military experts who used them for secretive surveillance missions			0
but following a decade of conflict fighting in @entity8 and @entity9 , drones have become an essential and controversial tool for the @entity12 military			1
operators - who you imagine are rather fond of computer games - sit in offices in @entity18 and @entity19 and direct the unmanned , missile - carrying planes to their next targets			0
secretive : military drones have massively increased in popularity over the past decade			0
but there are now very real fears that they could be used by government 's domestically			2
this is a @entity29 @entity28 controversial : president @entity30 signed a new law last year which opens up the possibility of police forces in the @entity12 using drones			1
this image shows just how small some of them could be as well as being used for spying , they are increasingly used to kill			0
and with an alarming accuracy			0
but with their popularity booming under the liberal - leaning president @entity30 , there are now very real concerns about their use on a more domestic level			1
in february last year , @entity30 signed a law directing @entity12 's @entity49 ( @entity49 ) to allow drones to fly in @entity12 airspace by september 2015			1
as reported by @entity53 , they could be used for patrolling borders for illegal immigrants , hunting for criminals and even maintaining crops			1
a number of police forces in the @entity12 have already shown an interest in using drones , with some likely to carry face - recognition software			1
lethal : drones have been used heavily by president @entity30 in @entity8 to spy on targets and kill enemy fighters			1
this is an @entity67 , armed with laser guided missiles future : a whole new fleet of drones , such as this one pictured , are currently being designed by aviation companies as well as government and university researchers this has already caused a storm of opposition from across the political spectrum over the effecton personal privacy			1
and if they become a regular fixture in the @entity12 , then it seems increasingly likely it is a matter of time before they are introduced into the skies of the @entity89			2
in the past decade drones have become a must - have weapon for the most advanced militaries in the world			2
back in 2002 , when @entity12 and the western world was looking down a barrel of conflict in some of the most dangerous and inhospitable locations on @entity99 , just 200 military drones were in use by the @entity12 military			1
but , with the @entity12 and @entity89 fighting mobile enemies in a variety of locations , drones increased dramatically			2
the @entity12 military has now deployed more than 11,000			2
and it is not just the @entity12 which is using them			2
more than 50 countries have drones , including @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
concerns : a number of police forces across the @entity12 have already taken a keen interest in drones			1
this @entity119 police officer shows off a drone recently , before the city 's mayor banned their use by officers way forward : this @entity128 helicopter was another drone owned by @entity119 police before privacy concerns prevented them from being used as well as saving money , they also save lives			2
instead of sending pilots into war zones , military commanders can instead send an unmanned drone which is controlled thousands of miles away from danger			0
this has led some defence experts to suggest that within a generation they could replace most manned military aircraft			0
talking point : many of the images of drones used in this piece were first published in the march issue of @entity53 , pictured but it is now looking increasingly likely that drones will be deployed more domestically			1
a whole new fleet of drones are currently being designed by aviation companies as well as government and university researchers			0
and , perhaps frighteningly , some are just the size of a hummingbird			0
following the law signed by @entity30 , it emerged recently that @entity12 authorities are increasing the number of licenses for surveillance drones			1
the @entity49 announced earlier this month that it had issued 1,428 permits to domestic drone operators since 2007 , which is far more than were previously known			0
the permits have been issued to police , universities , transport departments and at least seven federal agencies for devices from unarmed @entity177 drones to model airplanes			0
the @entity49 estimates that as many as 10,000 drones could take to the skies by 2020			0
but this has sparked opposition in the @entity12 from across the political spectrum with many concerned about the effects of drones on personal privacy and government intrusion			1
lawmakers in 15 states are already looking at plans to restrict drone use in their airspace amid concerns over spying			0
earlier this month the mayor of @entity119 even ordered the city 's police to abandon its plan to use drones after protests from residents and privacy campaigners .			1

unmanned drones have become president @entity30 's weapon of *choice* in war
but fears are growing over their use on a domestic level
police forces in @entity12 already keen to deploy drones to catch criminals
campaigners across political spectrum left worried about personal privacy
