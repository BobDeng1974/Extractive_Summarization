when @entity2 was sold to @entity3 for around £ 50million last summer , most @entity1 fans could n't quite believe that their club had acquired such a fee for the @entity6			1
last season saw @entity2 slip down the pecking order at @entity9 as @entity10 put his faith in @entity12 and @entity13 leaving the 27 - year - old limited to the occasional appearance in defensive midfield			1
however , when analysing the @entity6 's statistics in a @entity3 shirt , there is an argument that @entity2 has actually been outshining the 2014 - 15 @entity21 backline			2
@entity2 ( left ) was sold from to @entity3 for £ 50million last summer in his 25 @entity23 and @entity24 games for the @entity25 , @entity2 has won an impressive 147 duels which is more than @entity1 's defensive duo @entity13 ( 116 ) and @entity12 ( 122 )			1
@entity2 , who can often be seen stepping in front of his opponents in a bid to win the ball quickly , has also recorded 60 interceptions - more than @entity13 and @entity12 's combined total of 47			2
it must be said that @entity2 is now playing for arguably the best team in a far less competitive league , but his figures still go some way to proving that he still had a lot to offer @entity1 - particularly with the dip in form of @entity42 vice-captain @entity13			0
@entity2 has won 147 duels and made 60 interception in 25 games for his new club @entity12 ( left ) and @entity13 have started the majority of @entity1 games alongside each other this season @entity12 has made 145 appearances in 30 games for @entity1 so far this season after several poor performances in a blue shirt , @entity13 has had to look on as @entity55 youngster @entity54 flourishes with every chance he is given by @entity10 and the 20 - year - old has already made nine appearances in a blue shirt			1
despite conceding just 20 @entity62 goals so far this season , the @entity1 defence has rarely looked as solid as games in which @entity65 and @entity2 sat in front of the back four last season for the west @entity70 club 's biggest games such as the 1 - 0 victory against @entity72 in february , 2014			2
@entity21 fans will argue that @entity2 's style of play would be too dangerous now that their team play a more expansive , possession - based games following the introductions of @entity79 and @entity80			0
@entity55 youngster @entity54 ( left ) has impressed when selected by @entity21 boss @entity10 @entity2 is set to face his former team - mate @entity12 has @entity1 take on @entity3 on tuesday night @entity2 challenges @entity84 's @entity83 during @entity3 's 2 - 2 draw on saturday afternoon @entity12 , who has been easily @entity1 's best defender this season , has managed a whopping 145 clearances so far while chipping in with five goals in just 30 games			1
@entity13 and @entity12 look set to partner each other against on tuesday night as @entity1 travel to the @entity92 in search of an away win in the @entity24 last 16 first leg			0
speaking ahead of the @entity98 clash , @entity2 told a packed press conference : ' i think and i hope in this room , i am valued more than £ 50m			0
' he 'll certainly be out to prove that point to @entity102 when the @entity6 lines up against his former club on tuesday			0
@entity2 claimed that he is worth more than £ 50m during his pre-match press conference on monday			0

@entity2 was sold to @entity3 for £ 50million last summer
@entity6 's statistics show he has been out - performing the @entity1 defence
@entity2 has made more interceptions that @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity54 combined
27 - year - old will face former club in @entity24 last 16 clash
