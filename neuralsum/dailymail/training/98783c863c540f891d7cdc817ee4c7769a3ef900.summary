@entity1 's first minister @entity0 today warned @entity2 she would be in charge of any negotiations with @entity5 to form a coalition after the next election			1
the @entity9 leader , who is not standing for @entity10 , dismissed suggestions mr @entity2 would act as a back seat driver if he is elected to @entity10 in may			1
but at a rare appearance in @entity10 this afternoon ms @entity0 said she would ' lead the position ' in any talks with other parties in the event of another hung parliament			1
asked who would lead the negotiations , she replied : ' me '			0
@entity9 leader @entity0 , who is not standing for @entity10 , dismissed suggestions @entity2 would control @entity6 negotiations with @entity5 in the event of another hung @entity26 pressed on what role mr @entity2 might play , she said : ' if @entity2 is elected - as i would be fairly confident in predicting he will be - then @entity2 will be a key part of the team in @entity10 and , of course , will have a part to play			1
' but i am the party leader , @entity32 is the deputy of leader of the party , and we will lead the position			0
' it comes after she claimed @entity40 would be better run if @entity42 sat in the @entity43 with @entity5			2
the @entity9 leader said the majority of @entity1 want @entity5 to have to share power after may 's general election , which she said would lead to ' more progressive decisions for the whole of the @entity40 '			1
she boasted that she wanted to make sure ' @entity1 's voice is heard loudly at @entity10			2
' a string of opinion polls suggest the @entity9 will make big gains on may 7 , robbing @entity54 of an overall majority and forcing him into a @entity10 coalition with miss @entity0 's party			1
a huge row erupted last week when the @entity9 announced its mps planned to vote on laws which only affect @entity61 , including the running of the @entity63			0
miss @entity0 claimed her mps in @entity10 would take part in any votes which had an impact on @entity1 , claiming the repeal of @entity63 reforms imposed by the @entity72 - @entity71 coalition would have @entity40 - wide repercussions			1
@entity72 defence minister @entity74 branded the remarks ' complete twaddle ' and warned ms @entity0 was putting the @entity77 at risk again			0
a @entity80 poll for the @entity82 newspaper revealed that 35.1 per cent of @entity1 voters would prefer to see a deal between @entity5 and the @entity9 the latest @entity86 opinion poll suggests the @entity9 could will an incredible 55 of @entity1 's 59 seats , with @entity5 reduced to a rump of only four @entity64 - with the @entity72 and the @entity71 completely wiped out but miss @entity0 today vowed that the @entity9 will vote on @entity61 tax issues and claimed a @entity5 government dependent on @entity9 support would be fairer for the whole of the @entity40			1
she told @entity94 's @entity93 show on sunday : ' if you look at polls in @entity1 , as well as showing a substantial @entity9 lead they show that the most popular outcome in @entity1 in the general election is a @entity5 government dependent on @entity9 support , ' she said			1
' because i think people recognise that would lead to better decisions that were not just , perhaps , in the interests of @entity1 but more progressive decisions for the whole of the @entity40			2
' miss @entity0 , who took over as @entity1 first minister after @entity2 stood down , said she will also seek alliances with parties such as @entity110 and the @entity111 to be a ' progressive force in the @entity113 '			1
@entity1 's first minister met @entity115 in @entity1 last week ' i think the @entity10 establishment really needs some progressive forces at its heart , ' she added			0
' i want @entity1 to become independent , you have probably noticed that over the past wee while , but that will only happen when a majority of @entity1 want that to happen			0
' in the interim , what is really important is @entity1 's voice is heard loudly at @entity10			0
' an @entity127 poll for @entity128 last week found 52 per cent of @entity1 are planning to vote @entity9 in may			0
that would give the @entity42 an incredible 55 of @entity1 's 59 seats , with @entity5 reduced to a rump of only four @entity64 - with the @entity72 and the @entity71 completely wiped out			0
it would shatter @entity5 's hopes of an overall majority , and would leave @entity54 reliant on @entity9 votes to pass laws - including those which only affect @entity61			2
@entity5 leader @entity137 has not ruled out working with the @entity9 after the general election			2
but the @entity140 mp said ' it would be wrong ' to back the abolition of the @entity144 nuclear deterrent in exchange for @entity9 votes			0
his deputy @entity147 she said she would ' no qualms whatsoever ' about going into partnership with the @entity9 after the may election			0
speaking on the @entity94 's @entity151 , mr @entity137 said : ' i think it 's important that parties work together , it happens all across @entity1 in local authorities , but what @entity156 is talking about is the same thing that i 've been talking about which is that we 're not expecting , we 're not planning , we do n't want , and we do n't need a coalition with the @entity9			0
' the fact is that come the @entity40 election here in @entity1 in may it 's really a choice of whether @entity115 hangs on to power or whether we can get @entity115 out of @entity168 , and by voting @entity9 , unfortunately , a lot of @entity1 if they do so , run the risk that by accident they ensure that @entity115 holds onto power			1
