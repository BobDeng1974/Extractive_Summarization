when @entity1 put pen to paper at @entity4 on monday , he joined a long list of @entity7 fans to have signed for the club 's fierce local rivals			1
the midfielder will wear red instead of blue on his next visit to @entity12 as he bids to claim victory against the team he grew up supporting as a boy			1

' @entity30 used to reminisce about the good old days when @entity7 won the old first division championship and the @entity36 back in the 1970s and 80s but they were n’t quite so good when i started supporting them , ' he said			0
the former @entity47 will be hoping for a @entity4 win when his boyhood club visit @entity18 in september			0
switch : @entity1 has signed for @entity4 but supported @entity52 rivals @entity7 when he was growing up @entity4 confirm @entity1 deal @entity47 : @entity1 grew up watching the likes of @entity7 legend @entity32 at @entity12 @entity55 having once described himself as ' the biggest @entity47 in @entity57 ' , @entity55 ended up playing over 500 league games for the red half of @entity60			1
however the former centre back and @entity19 columnist has freely admitted the love he had for the @entity7 growing up			0
' i was a total @entity7 fanatic right through my childhood and teens , ' @entity55 said in 2008			0
' @entity7 controlled my life and dominated my thoughts 24/7			0
i went to the away games , followed them across @entity72 and in the mid- 80s went to @entity74 so often it began to feel like @entity75			0
' @entity76 in @entity57 ' : @entity4 legend @entity55 followed @entity7 home and away as a youngster watching on : @entity4 hero @entity55 sits in the home end during an @entity7 game at @entity12 in 2013 ' when i talk about that @entity7 team i still say ' we '			1
even when i was playing for @entity4 reserves i 'd want @entity7 's first team to win the derby every time			1
' following @entity87 ' last - gasp winner which denied @entity4 the 1989 @entity89 title , an 11 - year - old @entity55 applauded lads who scrawled ' thank you @entity92 ' on the wall of a @entity57 pub. during the defender 's @entity4 testimonial against the @entity7 in 2010 , @entity55 scored for both sides - the @entity99 legend hijacking @entity101 's penalty to score an ' own goal ' from the spot			2

ask any @entity47 about the @entity115 and they 'll probably roll their eyes before admitting most of those strikes probably came against @entity7 ! @entity109 , who scored twice in @entity4 's 3 - 2 triumph in the 1989 @entity36 final over @entity7 , holds the record for the most @entity60 derby goals having found the net 25 times against the club he supported as a youngster			1

the marksman appeared on the front cover of @entity134 in 1989 wearing an @entity7 top			0
however , when shocked supporters turned to the story , it was revealed the ' transfer ' was all part of an elaborate @entity142 hoax ! ' @entity109 for @entity143 ' read page seven			0
wind up : @entity109 pretended he 'd signed for @entity7 as part of a shoot magazine @entity142 prank in 1989 @entity148 given the nickname ' @entity150 ' by the @entity18 faithful , @entity148 grew up as an @entity7 fan before joining @entity4 's academy at age 11			1
the deadly striker , who scored 183 goals for the @entity99 during two spells at the club , even turned down a move to @entity12 as a teenager after falling in love with his surroundings			0
in an interview with @entity164 in 2009 , @entity148 said : ' when i was very young i used to watch them ( @entity7 ) but i was at @entity4 when i was 11 years old – i ’ve been a @entity4 fan from then on			1
loyal : @entity148 ( right ) , pictured here in action against @entity7 in 2006 , turned down the chance to join his boyhood club ' obviously i grew up watching very , very good @entity7 sides but i always knew deep down @entity4 were a better team			1
' before i was 14 years old i had a chance to sign for @entity7 but being at @entity4 , i was quite a loyal lad and because they had raised me i just did n’t want to jump ship			2
' at that time it would have been easier to get into the @entity7 first team but i stuck to my guns and am happy with decision i made ! ' legend : @entity148 went on to score 183 goals for @entity4 after avoiding the temptation to move to @entity12 @entity182 after his father @entity183 started his career with @entity7 in the mid-sixties , @entity182 grew up supporting the @entity7			1
as a youngster , when having a kick - about with his @entity30 , @entity182 would pretend to be former @entity7 frontman @entity187			1
shortly after starting high school , @entity190 , @entity92 , @entity191 and @entity4 all showed an interest in @entity182 , and , despite being a @entity47 , the striker decided to join the @entity99			2
the frontman went on to become one of the @entity196 's most - lethal finishers and burst onto the scene by scoring on his @entity4 debut against @entity199 in may 1997			0
lethal : @entity182 slots the ball past @entity199 goalkeeper @entity201 on his @entity4 debut in 1997 idol : @entity182 would often pretend to be @entity7 striker @entity187 when having a kick - about with his @entity30 line - up : @entity182 's father @entity183 ( top row , far right ) started his career with @entity7 in the mid-sixties @entity210 @entity210 was desperate to sign for @entity7 but ended up starting his career with @entity4 before earning a move to @entity214 giants @entity213 in 1999			1
in a 2004 interview with @entity217 , @entity215 said : ' when i was younger i was desperate to sign for @entity7 but they were n't as forthcoming as @entity4			2
for a young player , 15 years old , your chances were so much better at @entity4			0
' i think that when i was about signing age @entity4 's youth policy was much better than @entity7 's			2
' @entity210 was such a big @entity47 that during @entity4 training if he ever found the net with his head the wideman would shout ' @entity230 ! ' after @entity7 legend @entity231 , who played up front for the @entity7 during the 70s			2
wing wizard : @entity235 @entity210 was desperate to sign for @entity7 but ended up joining @entity4 @entity237 legend : @entity210 would shout the name of @entity230 when he scored in training @entity240 one of the few players to have represented both @entity60 clubs , @entity240 spent four years at @entity7 between 1979 and 1983 before moving to @entity4 in 1985 after two seasons at @entity244			1
born in @entity245 , @entity4 , the tough tackling midfielder cited @entity237 legend @entity247 as his childhood hero and an @entity36 victory against @entity4 as his favourite moment in an interview with @entity252 in the early 1980s			0
despite his connections with the @entity7 , @entity240 went on to make over 200 appearances for @entity4 during a six - year period , winning three league titles and two @entity257			2
starting out : boyhood @entity7 fan @entity240 ( right ) chases down @entity244 's @entity258 ( centre ) champions : @entity240 ( centre ) holds the @entity89 trophy after victory with @entity4 @entity264 - and what about these two ... @entity266 after a photo emerged of @entity4 captain @entity266 wearing a full @entity7 kit and posing with the club 's trophies as a youngster , arguments ensued across @entity60 about whether or not the @entity99 ' talisman actually grew up a @entity47			1
however , it transpired that after @entity7 had won the @entity89 in 1987 , @entity266 ’s uncle @entity274 took @entity275 - then seven - to @entity12 to have his photo taken with the trophy and the @entity278			2
@entity274 even bought his nephew a new @entity7 kit for the photo shoot			0
rather amusingly , @entity7 fans often joke that the photo is the closest @entity266 has ever got to the title ! @entity47 ? @entity266 was dressed in @entity7 kit to have his picture taken with the @entity89 trophy and @entity278 in 1987 @entity288 rumour has it @entity4 offered a trial to @entity288 before his beloved @entity237 spotted him			1
the staunch toffee - who was once a mascot at a @entity60 derby - did accept @entity4 's offer but insisted on wearing his full @entity7 kit			1
eventually ending up at @entity12 , the frontman went on to live the dream and marked his arrival in an @entity7 shirt by scoring that goal against @entity92 in 2002 aged just 16			2
however , having once famously revealed a shirt which read ' once a @entity47 , always a @entity47 ' , @entity288 eventually went on to play in red when he joined @entity191 in 2004			0
all smiles : @entity288 poses with @entity7 captain @entity306 ahead of the @entity60 derby in 1996			0
