just five years ago @entity0 's 16 acres were nothing but neglected industrial land			1
and then entrepreneur @entity3 came along and snapped up the site for £ 750,000 from the landowner who was going bust			1
it was clearly a sound investment , as @entity0 , with its pool , trout lake , tennis courts , golfing green , triple garage – and a helipad on the lawn – is now on the market for the princely sum of £ 6 million			1
seven years ago , at the grand old age of 31 , @entity3 had retired to a villa in @entity18 with his pregnant wife @entity19 , after selling his aviation spare parts company for several million pounds			1
' i went to @entity18 to retire and relax and it was a lovely lifestyle but i could n't just switch off my entrepreneurial brain , ' says @entity3			1
from his sunlounger , @entity3 spotted a gap in the market for providing luxury corporate holiday villas for wealthy @entity44 bankers , and before long he was brokering deals of tens of thousands of pounds by the side of the swimming pool			1
mr @entity3 with his wife @entity48 and children @entity50 and @entity51 at @entity53 mansion ' we had a constant stream of bookings from directors waving around the company @entity58 card who would n't think twice about spending £ 30,000 on a week 's holiday let , ' he says			1
' but when the banking crash happened in 2008 , bookings dried up			2
' @entity3 sold the villa in @entity18 ( which he 'd bought for a seven - figure sum ) to a wealthy @entity65 , and returned to @entity66			1
restless as ever , he set up a construction company , but found that because of the recession , business was slow			2
so he set the team to work on his own house in @entity53			2
@entity73 : £ 6 million location : near @entity75 , @entity53 bedrooms : five unique features : helipad , swimming pool , trout lake , tennis courts , golf green , triple garage , nightclub - style reception area , @entity86 - controlled electrics			1
' my builders were all genuine people who i could have a real conversation with – none of the corporate falseness			0
because they were great guys , i wanted to keep them busy			0
' @entity3 spent £ 500,000 pulling down the old industrial units and a further £ 3.5 million on building the house , which is approached through electric gates along a snaking gravel drive			1
the couple worked with an architect to create a five - bedroom home that ticked all the boxes required under their planning permission , while reflecting their own unique style			1
as a condition of giving consent for such a large house , the council insisted the build must have architectural merit – so the couple built it in the traditional style of famous @entity66 architect sir @entity113			1
glitzy : the home 's reception area is styled on a nightclub - and it even boasts its own bar the helipad on the lawn has seen regular use as the couple often charter a helicopter to take them to @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			1
' it 's a great way to get in to @entity130 – i can be at a meeting in town in 12 minutes , ' says @entity3			1
the house has been designed to maximise stunning views over both the @entity23 , and the influence of the family 's time in @entity18 is in evidence in the balustrades and palm trees on the terrace			0
' this house is ridiculously ' high spec ' because we built it for ourselves			2
my wife and i created it from the drawing board , ' says @entity3 inside , the ' nightclub - style ' open plan reception area leads down to a sunken living space with vaulted ceiling			1
it has lasers , mood lighting , smoke machines , a dancing pole and a white leather and cubic zirconia bar , modelled on that found in the @entity162 of @entity130 department store @entity163			0
' this house is ridiculously ' high spec ' because we built it for ourselves			2
my wife and i created it from the drawing board , ' says @entity3			1

it was erected in 1919 for the @entity175 built for @entity177 by sir @entity113 between 1921 and 1924 , the dolls house is a perfect replica in miniature of an aristocratic home from life below stairs to the high - society setting of the saloon and dining room , no detail was forgotten the enormous bespoke kitchen is his favourite room in the house , with its huge granite kitchen island			1
' we had it shipped from @entity195 in one complete piece , ' he says			0
other extravagances include mature olive trees imported from @entity199 and gold - leaf tiles in the bathrooms			0
everything in the house can be controlled by @entity86 , including the music , temperature and @entity206			1
