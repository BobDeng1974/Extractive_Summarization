private hospitals have offered doctors six - figure sums to refer patients to them over rivals , a major investigation has revealed			1
the doctors ' regulator , the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , failed to act after receiving evidence of widespread payments to consultants in private practice in exchange for referrals to certain hospital groups , particularly those in @entity17 , it has been claimed			1
the discovery has prompted a leading medical journal to call for doctors in the @entity21 to be forced to declare their financial interests			0
the report published in the @entity25 is based on an investigation by a major health insurance company , which uncovered ' covert ' schemes often worth ' tens of thousands ' of pounds , with some payments exceeding six figures , it said			1
the insurance company called on the @entity7 to ' take a clear position on this ' , but the regulator took no action , the report said			1
the @entity25 said it had learned that the apparently widespread practice first came to light during an internal investigation launched by the insurance company in 2011			2
doctors in the @entity21 should be forced to declare their financial interests , the @entity21 's leading medical journal has said , after it emerged private hospitals have offered doctors ' tens of thousands ' of pounds to refer patients to them over rival hospitals ( file picture posed by models ) land registry records showed that many independent practices were housed in expensive @entity17 properties owned by private hospital groups			1
one document seen by @entity25 showed 73 properties , many in @entity58 locations , including @entity59 and @entity60 , are owned by the giant @entity62 hospital corporation @entity61 alone			2
in 2014 , @entity64 ( @entity65 ) issued an order that prohibits inducement schemes - but the @entity25 has heard evidence that some hospitals are continuing to ' buy ' referrals , the report added			2
one senior surgeon told the @entity25 that he had been approached by a hospital group hoping to attract his referrals away from a rival as recently as nine months ago			1
a spokesman for the @entity76 , @entity17 's largest independent hospital and an opponent of consultant incentive schemes , said although the rules had been ' tightened considerably ' by the @entity65 order ' we are still seeing consultants being approached by competitors			0
' the @entity7 's @entity84 does set standards on financial arrangements and conflicts of interest			1
but the bmj 's editor in chief , dr @entity90 , said the investigation ' shows an unwillingness to act on possible breaches of these standards '			0
the investigation by a health insurer uncovered ' covert schemes ' aimed at consultants in private practice , encouraging them to send patients to specific private hospital groups , particularly in @entity17 she added : ' the @entity7 's belief that its role is limited to offering guidance on conflicts of interests is unsatisfactory			1
' its promise to review whether more can be done to help doctors manage potentially conflicting financial ties is vague and insufficient			0
' she has called for new guidelines that stipulate @entity21 doctors ' financial interests should be included in ' a publicly available and searchable central register , updated as part of annual appraisal '			0
she warned that , ' unless the @entity7 is serious about regulating doctors ' financial conflicts of interest , insidious inducement schemes will continue to reward private hospital groups and some doctors at the expense of patients , the very people that the @entity7 is obliged to protect '			1
one document seen by @entity25 revealed 73 properties , many in @entity59 , are owned by the giant @entity62 hospital corporation @entity61 alone @entity7 chief executive @entity129 said he understood concerns about incentive schemes			2
in a statement , he said : ' our guidance states that doctors " must not allow any interests you have to affect the way you prescribe for , treat , refer or commission services for patients "			0
' we set out that doctors " must be open and honest with your patients about any such interests that could be seen to affect the way you prescribe for , advise , treat , refer or commission services for them "			0
' our guidance is comprehensive and clear in respect of the responsibilities of individual doctors and we have taken appropriate action against individual doctors in the past where there has been evidence that our guidance has been breached			0
he said the @entity7 will be writing to all independent healthcare providers to seek assurances that they are not putting their doctors in a position where they could be acting outside @entity7 guidance			2
mr @entity129 said the @entity7 is exploring the possibility of recording doctors ' commercial interests on the register			0
and he added the regulator are reviewing the @entity169 report , which highlights the potential for conflicts of interest to arise when doctors refer patients for medical treatment			1
but the insurance investigator said he found it ' staggering and totally unacceptable that the @entity7 , as the official regulator of the medical profession , can receive a report from a public body showing that one of the key duties of a doctor is being widely flouted and do nothing about it			2
' it was , he added , ' a sad day for the medical profession when a competition regulator has had to issue an order stopping such schemes because our own regulator , the @entity7 , has failed to do so			0
' the @entity7 said it did not receive a formal complaint against individual doctors and so could not investigate further .			0
