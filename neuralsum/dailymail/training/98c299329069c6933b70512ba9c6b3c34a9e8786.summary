by @entity0 for @entity1 a mother is facing a £ 7,000 bill after her 12 - year - old son ran up huge charges playing a popular online game on his phone			1
@entity8 said she and her son @entity9 were not given any warning about costs of up to £ 240 a day on @entity12			1
@entity13 said @entity14 , the developer of the game , was responsible for setting the charges			1
she added : ' the only way i have financially of raising that money is selling my car and i need my car to get to work			2
' i naively thought the industry was better regulated than this - that there were safeguards in place			0
' before you download the game it says there are in - app purchases and each time you make one you have to approve it			2
' nobody at any point alerted me to the situation			0
' ms @entity8 's son inadvertently paid extra charges that are used to progress in the game			1
in similar games , players can pay for extra gaming credits - or add - ons - which would otherwise take a long time to build up or as a fast track to unlocking content in the game			1
she told @entity18 : ' he bought two add - ons totalling £ 5.98 for the game @entity12 and the phone has kept buying ( add - ons ) at a rate of £ 240 per day			1
' @entity9 said : ' i was confused to what had happened - i did n't have a clue			0
' his mother said she did not blame her son , but added : ' he was slightly over-enthusiastic when playing on his phone			1
' @entity68 , a games expert with @entity70 website , said he had tried the game and that there were various password options for when transactions were necessary , including just once at the beginning , every 30 minutes or after each transaction			2
smartphones often operate on a system where applications themselves are free but various add - ons will then be offered to you in exchange for money			0
this could take the form of in - game credits or ' currency ' to help secure game upgrades or unlockable content or extra features with the application			2
but there are options to turn off in - app purchases off on different systems			0
on @entity101 's @entity100 the ' restrictions ' menu it is possible to turn such purchases off altogether or set your own password			2
tap on ' settings ' then ' general ' and ' restrictions ' then tap ' @entity109 ' and choose a pin and enter it a second time to confirm			0
at this point it 's possible to set restrictions from a menu and in the ' @entity117 ' menu , slide ' in app purchases ' to ' off '			2
on @entity121 open @entity120 ' and then ' settings ' and under ' @entity123 ' there is an option to enter the pin to confirm			0
at this point , tick the box to ' @entity110 for purchases ' - anyone wanting to make a puchase in the app will have to know the pin			0
on @entity132 open the @entity134 app and choose ' menu ' then ' settings ' and then select ' @entity137 before tapping on ' @entity138 '			0
at this point you can enter your @entity142 password or tick the ' @entity144 ' box , if you prefer a pin			0
but he was unable to explain how £ 240 would have been charged every day			1
' for each payment made there would have been an email receipt sent to the person whose @entity151 account is registered on the phone			0
' before you download the game it says there are in - app purchases and each time you make one you have to approve it			0
' mrs @entity8 said : ' mobile firms need to review procedures , and forget making a profit from vulnerable people			1
' @entity13 said it has placed mrs @entity8 's bill on hold to allow to her resolve the issue with the game provider			1
@entity14 refused to comment on individual complaints , but advised users to read the parent 's policy on the firm 's website .			1
