by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:25 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 20:54 est , 4 january 2013 victim : @entity3 , 46 , started to feel ill on the evening of christmas day after the meal at the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			1
she died two days later a woman who died from food poisoning two days after eating a pub @entity11 lunch had been sent home from hospital and told to lie down			1
@entity3 , 46 , was one of 30 diners to fall ill after eating a £ 39.95 four - course meal at the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			1
but while the others started to recover , her condition deteriorated and on @entity19 her husband @entity18 took her to the nearest accident and emergency unit			1
despite the fact she was obviously very unwell , mr @entity23 claims that doctors merely gave her an anti-sickness injection and told her to ‘ go home and lie down ’			1
her condition worsened , and that evening he called an ambulance fearing she barely had a pulse			1
she died the following day at @entity30 in @entity31 , less than 24 hours after being sent home by doctors in the casualty unit			1
mr @entity23 , 51 , chief executive of a recruitment firm , said the hospital had ‘ turned my wife away ’ rather than trying to save her life			2
‘ they sent her home and she just lay in my arms , basically she was dying			2
we called an ambulance and went back to the hospital but she barely had a pulse			2
it was disgusting the way she was dealt with			0
’ last autumn the hospital ’s @entity48 unit was heavily criticised by the official watchdog which warned that at times the standards of care were ‘ collapsing ’			2
suspected : @entity3 was one of 30 diners to fall ill after eating a four - course meal at the @entity5 in @entity54 , @entity7 the @entity55 also found half of patients were having to wait more than an hour to be seen by a doctor or nurse			1
speaking from his home in @entity6 , mr @entity23 said : ‘ if she was rolling around on the floor they would have admitted her – but because she was dignified she was n’t			1
‘ @entity3 was so fit and healthy , i ca n’t believe it			1
this is @entity65 were about to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary			0
’ mr @entity23 , who has a 14 - year - old daughter , said he planned to sue @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , which runs @entity30 , and the @entity5 where they had the meal			1
officials from the @entity74 have since confirmed that mrs @entity3 , whose funeral will take place today , had contracted @entity77 , a common form of food poisoning that strikes around 90,000 @entity79 a year			1
investigation : the @entity81 has launched an investigation with @entity83 to establish whether there are links between the outbreak of food poisoning and food eaten at the @entity5 it is not usually fatal and only one in around 10,000 victims die – mainly the elderly , babies or those with an underlying illness			1
symptoms include stomach cramps and diarrhoea which usually resolve themselves without treatment within 24 hours			2
it is caused by eating turkey , chicken or red meat that has been contaminated by @entity77 bacteria			0
if food is left outside a fridge for a long period of time the bacteria multiply			0
it is not clear whether this outbreak was caused by infected turkey or cold meat starters that had been served beforehand			0
treatment : mrs @entity3 was initially seen at @entity30 in @entity31 , pictured one guest at the pub who was among the 30 to have been struck down said he had ‘ never felt so ill in his life			1
’ @entity117 , who lives in @entity6 said : ‘ it ruined my @entity11 and @entity119 , but luckily i survived it			1
i ’m very sad to hear that a lady has died			0
’ a spokesman for @entity122 , which runs the @entity123 said : ‘ the local authority is investigating an alleged food poisoning outbreak at the @entity123			2
‘ we are fully co-operating			0
until the investigation is complete we ca n’t speculate about a possible cause or source			1
’ the hospital has apologised to the family although it insisted its staff gave ‘ appropriate ’ treatment			2
dr @entity134 , medical director of the trust , promised to ‘ fully review ’ the case			0
the trust is currently facing severe financial difficulties having amassed debts of £ 50million			0
the bacterium @entity77 is widely distributed in the environment and food			0
it is the third most common cause of food poisoning in the @entity79			0
if spores of the bacteria survive cooking , they can germinate to form growing cells			0
spores can not grow in a refrigerator or freezer but thrive at room temperature			0
in optimal growing conditions , the organism has a generation time of 10 to 12 minutes			0
when a large number of the vegetative cells are consumed this will more - likely - than - not lead to gastroenteritis			0
nasty : the bacterium @entity77 is widely distributed in the environment and food food poisoning from the bacteria most often occurs when foodstuffs , usually red meat or poultry , is prepared in advance and kept warm for several hours before serving			2
the illness , with diarrhoea and abdominal pain the main symptoms , generally lasts for less than 24 hours but elderly people may be more seriously affected			0
the bacteria is also responsible for 80 - 95 per cent of gas gangrene cases , a rare but severe form of gangrene .			0
