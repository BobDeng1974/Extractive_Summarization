the @entity0 have moved into their strongest poll position for almost five years			0
as @entity2 prepares to go to @entity3 to mark the formal start of the general election campaign , ending the long phoney war between the political parties , an exclusive @entity9 poll for the @entity10 and @entity11 shows the @entity12 have opened up a four - point lead over @entity14			1
@entity0 jitters about the party 's campaign will be eased by the survey , which suggests @entity14 has slipped back since last week 's bruising tv encounter between the two main party leaders and interviewer @entity21			2
it is their best vote share since @entity36 's so - called ' @entity35 , which included taxes on hot pasties and caravans , which prompted a @entity0 slump			1
the party has to reach even further back - to september 2010 - for the last time it enjoyed a four - point lead with @entity9			1
@entity44 is on 12 per cent , well down on last year 's peak of 19 per cent , with the @entity46 showing signs of a modest recovery , on nine per cent			1
the @entity49 have slipped back to five per cent			0
the poll is the mirror image of a @entity53 survey over the weekend , which put @entity14 on 36 per cent and the @entity12 on 32 per cent			1
an @entity55 poll , meanwhile , yesterday put the @entity12 ahead , on 34 per cent to @entity14 's 33 per cent			2
tbe @entity9 poll finds mr @entity2 has extended his lead over mr @entity58 over which of them is best suited to lead the country an exclusive @entity9 poll for the @entity10 and @entity11 news puts @entity2 and the conservatives up one point on last week with 36 per cent , while @entity58 's @entity14 is on 32 per cent , down three points the survey comes after last week 's bruising tv encounter between the two main party leaders and interviewer @entity21 ( pictured ) following thursday ’s television grilling by mr @entity21 , half of all adults in @entity72 think mr @entity2 would make a better prime minister -- 50 per cent -- compared to three in ten -- 29 per cent -- who back mr @entity58			1
this represents a fall of four points for the @entity78 on the last @entity9 poll , conducted last week before the tv clash			1
incredibly , 18 per cent of @entity14 voters think that mr @entity2 would make a better prime minister than mr @entity58 , suggesting even some of his party 's own supporters are unconvinced			2
this compares to just one per cent of conservative voters who think that mr @entity58 would be the better prime minister			0
with a seven - way television debate , featuring mr @entity2 , mr @entity58 and the leaders of the @entity46 , @entity44 , the @entity90 , @entity91 and the @entity49 looming this thursday , voters are around twice as likely to associate mr @entity2 than mr @entity58 with being ' good on television ' , by 64 per cent to 31 per cent			1
just 29 per cent back mr @entity58 as prime minister , which represents a fall of four points for the @entity78 on the last @entity9 poll , which was conducted last week before the tv clash mr @entity2 also has a big lead on which of the two is considered a strong leader , with 60 per cent of voters choosing him versus 33 per cent for mr @entity58			1
however , it is not all good news for mr @entity2 : he is significantly more likely to be viewed as arrogant than mr @entity58 , by 52 per cent to 35 per cent			0
the @entity14 leader has narrower leads on which of the two is seen as more genuine and understanding of the real world			0
when given a straight choice between a @entity14 - led government and a @entity0 - led government after the next election , the poll finds voters ' preference is too close to call , with 41 per cent wanting the former and 42 per cent the latter			2
however , in the event of a hung @entity120 , there is a clear preference for the current coalition to continue			0
presented with a decision between a conservative - liberal @entity125 coalition and a @entity14 – @entity90 arrangement , 45 per cent of voters say that they would prefer the @entity130 - @entity129 option , compared to just 33 per cent who prefer lab - @entity90			0
@entity132 , head of political polling at @entity9 , said : ' it is too soon to attribute any movement in the polls to the @entity21 effect			0
while this is bound to be a volatile election with both @entity14 and the @entity0 running each other close , the longer term trends points towards the @entity0 beginning to dig in and strengthen their position			0
' @entity2 ’s ratings as a strong leader will serve him well through the coming seven - way debate as the challengers attempt to bring him down			0

*tories* are up one point with 36 *****%***** , while @entity14 is down three points to 32 *****%*****
it is their best vote share since @entity36 's ' @entity35
last time they had four - point lead with @entity9 poll was september 2010
