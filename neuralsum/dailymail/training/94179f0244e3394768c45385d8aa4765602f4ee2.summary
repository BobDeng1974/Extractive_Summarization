the @entity1 military is investigating a photograph that shows a soldier allegedly raising a gay pride flag at a base in @entity6			1
the series of three photographs , which were originally posted on the wall of a @entity11 group called ‘ @entity12 , ’ have been incredibly polarising			1
while the gay community is largely praising the flag - flying , some conservatives are livid , and are saying that @entity1 troops are in mortal peril because of it			2
flying the flag : a @entity11 user named @entity21 posted this image to @entity12 and wrote : ' hubbie in @entity6 raising a gay pride flag ' sequence : the three photographs show an unidentified soldier placing the gay pride flag on a pole in what looks like a @entity1 military base in @entity6 @entity30 , president of the @entity31 , is one of them			1
he wrote : ' there , in the dusty desert of war , an @entity34 outpost saluted the colours of the homosexual lobby by flying a rainbow flag in place of @entity42			2
' these displays are an uncomfortable reminder of the open policy that few of the troops support			0
' he placed blame on president @entity50 , accusing him for being intolerant toward religious freedom			0
gay pride : last week , @entity53 became the first private military academy to host a gay pride week a woman named @entity21 posted the picture on the group ’s @entity11 wall on march 24th with a message that read : ‘ @entity61 in @entity6 raising a gay pride flag			1
’ conservative : @entity30 , president of the @entity31 the @entity64 told @entity65 that it is investigating the incident , but said they were unsure where in @entity6 the flag was raised , who was raising it , and the photograph ’s authenticity			1
ms @entity21 wrote in a follow up note that the picture was not photoshopped , and thanked people for their support			0
mr @entity30 compared the flying of the gay flag to the accidental @entity79 burnings earlier this year			0
he wrote : ‘ after february ’s accident with the @entity79 , @entity1 lives were lost			2
' what price will we pay because some want to use the military to show their gay pride ? ’ however , as @entity87 said , mr @entity30 was n’t as concerned over the @entity79 burnings a few weeks ago , saying it ‘ does n’t hold a torch to what ’s happening to faith in @entity1			1
’ the @entity92 fired back saying that to mr @entity30 , ‘ everything is an attack on @entity95			0
the mere fact that there are homosexuals in the military , now serving their country openly , is an affront to @entity30 ’ sense of religious entitlement			2
’ the gay pride flag , also known as the rainbow flag , is a well - known symbol of @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , transgender pride ( @entity111 )			0
the first known pride flag was made by @entity113 for the @entity114 in 1978 .			0
