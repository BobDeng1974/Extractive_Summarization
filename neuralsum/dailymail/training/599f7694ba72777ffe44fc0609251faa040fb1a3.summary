by @entity0 published : 08:41 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 04:00 est , 21 may 2013 @entity1 , who is seven , has had radiotherapy and will start chemotherapy for his brain tumour next month the father of a seven - year - old boy who was taken on the run by his mother to spare him the ordeal of radiotherapy has hit back at her claims that the life - saving treatment had ‘ broken ’ him			1
@entity12 , 34 , insisted their son @entity13 , who has completed 30 sessions of radiotherapy following the removal of a large brain tumour last year , was making good progress and that doctors were ‘ cautiously optimistic ’ that he would make a full recovery			0
mr @entity1 reacted after his estranged wife @entity21 , 37 , who lost a high - profile legal battle to stop her son receiving the treatment , claimed that radiotherapy had damaged @entity25 irreparably			1
in december , mrs @entity26 fled with her son to prevent him being given the treatment following the removal of the tumour in october			1
she argued that radiotherapy could cause him to suffer serious side effects such as stunted growth and infertility , and wanted to be allowed to pursue alternative treatments			0
the @entity35 , however , dismissed her case after doctors advised the child would die within three months if he was denied the ‘ gold standard ’ treatment			1
the court said her judgment had ‘ gone awry ’			0
yesterday , mr @entity1 , from @entity43 , said @entity13 was having a short break from treatment before starting chemotherapy in early april			1
he acknowledged that his son had suffered side effects such as tiredness , but said these were to be expected in the short term			0
@entity13 's mother @entity21 , left , is fighting her son 's treatment but her estranged husband @entity55 supports the doctors his wife , a @entity58 who now lives in @entity59 , claimed this week that @entity13 was ‘ grey and fragile ’ and ‘ not the boy i know any more ’			1
she added : ‘ i look into my little boy ’s eyes and there is nothing there			2
' i see this child who was always laughing and happy sitting with his little head in his hands crying			0
‘ the thing that scared me most was that the radiation would change him , damage him – and it has done both			0
’ @entity26 and @entity75 's dr @entity74 disagreed over the best treatment for ms @entity13 yesterday happier times : @entity79 and his mother @entity26 before he was diagnosed with a brain tumour a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy gives young patients up to an 86 per cent chance of survival			1
but delays in @entity13 ’s treatment cut his chances of surviving to 67 per cent			2
the @entity35 ordered that he lives with his father during his treatment , and mrs @entity26 , who spent @entity94 away from her son and his twin sister , @entity97 , is prohibited from removing him from her estranged husband ’s care			1
short - term side effects can include : tiredness , which may last for several months after the treatment is @entity103 can be a problem for many people , although doctors can prescribe anti-sickness drugs to @entity108 loss can result from feeling sick or as a result of the treatment @entity111 colour and texture can be affected , and patients can develop sores , itchiness or rashes			2
radiotherapy patients should also avoid being outside in bright sun for a year after treatment and cover up in @entity122 loss tends to develop two to three weeks after the treatment and it may take several months to grow back			2
there are risks to the patient having radiotherapy but most are small and short - term , and are far outweighed by the benefits bone marrow can be affected by radiotherapy and this will be monitored by @entity134 - term side effects are rare but can include : hair - loss or change of colour or @entity138 becoming darker or changing in @entity139 if the ovaries or testicles were in the treatment @entity142 in a limb ( lymphoedema ) can occur when lymph nodes are @entity148 spidery marks ( telangectasia ) may appear on the @entity149 of breath , narrowing of the vagina , and narrowing of the oesophagus can occur as these areas become less stretchy passing a lot of urine can happen if the bladder becomes less stretchy second cancers can very rarely be caused by radiotherapy but doctors say the risks of this happening are far outweighed by the potential benefits of the treatment			0
