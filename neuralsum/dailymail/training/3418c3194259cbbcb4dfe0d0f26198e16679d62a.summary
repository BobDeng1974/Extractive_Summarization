@entity0 , 61 , suffered from high blood pressure that does n't respond to medication around 500,000 people suffer from high blood pressure that does n't respond to medication			1
new research has shown that an implant in the leg can help them			2
@entity0 , 61 , a teacher from @entity10 , @entity11 , was one of the first in the @entity13 to undergo the procedure , as she tells @entity15			1
the patient when i was pregnant with my only child , @entity18 , 28 years ago , i suffered from pre-eclampsia , a condition which caused me to have very high blood pressure			1
at its highest it was 220/120 ( a healthy reading is 140/90 )			0
i had an emergency caesarean at eight months because my blood pressure was so high it could have triggered a stroke			1
@entity18 was healthy , but i was in hospital for three weeks because my blood pressure did not go down			1
i was put on high doses of medication and warned that a second baby could be dangerous as my pre-eclampsia could worsen next time			2
ever since , i 've visited my gp every three months to check my blood pressure and medication			1
but despite different pills and combinations , my blood pressure has remained at around 180/100			1
i 've tried to cut it by staying a healthy weight , avoiding adding salt to food , and exercising frequently			0
doctors said it was probably hereditary - my grandfather died of a stroke at 29 , and my uncle at 65			0
three years ago , things got worse			0
i spent a week with constant pins and needles in my arms and my blood pressure went as high as 220/110			1
i was immediately sent to @entity49 - i had to stay in hospital for observation for 30 hours as doctors feared i was having a heart attack			0
then i was referred to a cardiologist			0
i was on five different blood pressure drugs , with side - effects , including excruciating migraines that lasted up to three days			1
in 2012 i was referred to dr @entity58 , a hypertension specialist			0
tests showed an enlarged heart muscle - a sign it 's damaged			2
my high blood pressure meant my heart had to work harder to pump blood round my body			1
dr @entity58 gave me a liquid medication called nifedipine , which helped a bit , but when he said there was a mechanical solution i was keen to try it			0
he said it would involve having a small metal clip implanted in my thigh - it would join a vein and an artery together , so some blood from the artery could leak into the vein , reducing my blood pressure			1
i would be part of a clinical trial			0
i had the hour - long procedure in june 2013			0
first i had local anaesthetic around my groin and they inserted a thin hollow tube into an artery leading to my heart to monitor my blood pressure			1
then they inserted the implant in my right thigh			2
the teacher from @entity10 , @entity11 , had an implant fitted in her right thigh on the operating table my blood pressure dropped to 120/70			1
it was painful despite the anaesthetic and my right leg was bruised and swollen - i was off work for six weeks			0
my blood pressure is now around 140/70 , slightly raised but a great improvement			1
i still take some medication , including nifedipine , but it 's nothing compared with the cocktail of drugs i used to have			2
tests have shown my enlarged heart muscle is starting to heal itself			0
i no longer live in fear of a heart attack or stroke , or have debilitating side - effects from the drugs			0
it 's a huge relief			0
the specialist number of people in the @entity13 believed to have undiagnosed high blood pressure dr @entity58 is director of the hypertension clinic at @entity121 in @entity122			1
we need pressure to push blood from the heart to the arteries and the major organs , then back to the heart again			2
the problem is if your blood pressure is high - which affects more than 15 million @entity13 - the heart has to work harder to pump blood , which weakens it			1
increased pressure can also damage artery walls , and can cause a blockage , leading to a stroke or a heart attack			2
in a blood pressure reading , the top number ( systolic pressure ) is the pressure exerted when the heart contracts and pushes blood around the body			1
the lower number ( diastolic pressure ) refers to when the heart relaxes between beats			0
a healthy reading is around 120/80 but high blood pressure is anything above 140/90			1
she still takes some medication but it 's nothing compared with the cocktail of drugs she used to we try to treat hypertension with lifestyle changes , such as losing weight , reducing alcohol and salt			2
but high blood pressure can be hereditary , so these may not have an effect			1
some patients need medication for the rest of their life			0
it can include @entity173 inhibitors , which relax blood vessels , and beta - blockers , which make the heart beat more slowly			2
calcium channel blockers widen arteries , and diuretics flush excess water and salt but all have potential side - effects - @entity173 inhibitors can trigger a cough , diuretics can lead to erectile dysfunction			0
and in about 500,000 patients , conventional medical therapy fails to control high blood pressure			1
there are now alternative , device - based treatments for helping these patients bring down their blood pressure			1
one is the coupler device , a paper clip - sized implant inserted in the upper thigh under local anaesthetic			1
it affects how blood circulates round the body - we effectively transfer blood from a major artery into a major vein , which reduces systolic blood pressure			1
once implanted , the coupler lowers blood pressure by more than 15 per cent and this reduction seems to be long lasting			1
in a clinical trial of 83 patients , 44 patients were given the device			0
they experienced significant , lasting reduction in blood pressure , according to a study published last month in the @entity219			2
the procedure involves making a 2mm incision in the groin and inserting thin tubes into two key blood vessels , the femoral artery and vein			2
we put a guide wire in to pierce another vein and artery higher in the groin			2
we then insert the nickel titanium alloy implant ; this joins these two vessels together and keeps this passageway open			0
when blood pressure in the artery becomes dangerously high , small amounts of pressurised blood flows safely from the artery into the vein , reducing blood pressure			1
the effect is immediate for some , for others it takes a few hours			0
the procedure is reversible but has not been needed so far			0
it does have a potential side - effect			0
most patients developed leg swelling - the implant can narrow the artery , causing an increase in blood flow in the vein above it , which can lead to swelling			1
this is often rectifiable with diuretic medication to flush water from the body			0
however , 29 per cent of patients need a stent - a small tube - inserted in the narrowed arteries to treat the problem			2
@entity261 ? ' the implant is relatively simple to insert , and reversible , the downside is that you undergo a procedure , ' says @entity266 , president of the @entity267 and professor of clinical pharmacology at the @entity270			0
' some side - effects we know - problems at the insertion site and leg swelling - but some are still unknown , as relatively few people have been treated this way			0
' more research could let us help patients with hard - to - control hypertension			0
but more study is needed before it can be recommended for routine @entity283 use			0
' interested patients can email @entity286 blood pressure clinic for details			2

@entity0 , 61 , a teacher from @entity10 , @entity11 , has high blood pressure
she 's like 500,000 others who do n't seem to respond to medication
the mother opted for a new alternative , device to try bring it down
the coupler is a paper clip - sized implant inserted in the upper thigh
it effectively transfers blood from an artery into a vein , reducing pressure
