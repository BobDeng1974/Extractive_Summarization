@entity0 faces the prospect of being without power for a week today after @entity3 caused mass blackouts and triggered a series of explosions			1
in total , more than six million @entity7 across the @entity8 have been affected after the devastation wreaked by @entity3 caused power cuts on an unprecedented scale			1
in @entity0 alone , more than 600,000 residents are without power after an explosion at a @entity17 power plant			1
but much of the damage was caused by the explosion at the 14th street power station will take up to a week to repair as restoring electrical service to underground equipment requires the cleaning away of sea water to all components , drying and testing to make it safe to restore power			1
in addition to the flood waters , heavy winds have downed power lines across the region			1
a company statement said : ' @entity29 is reporting power outages to a large section of @entity17 stretching from @entity30 39th street to the lower tip of @entity17			1
' the outage was caused by flooding in company substations and engineers are working to correct the problem			2
' this will be one for the record books , ' said @entity65 , senior vice president for electric operation at @entity29			2
' this will be the largest storm - related outage in our history			1
' the previous record was more than 200,000 customers affected by @entity73 in 2011 , the company added			0
in the dark : this @entity29 graphic shows the location of power cuts across the @entity0 area crippled : the @entity79 has blanket supply problems the company released that 193,000 customers have lost power in @entity17 , 158,000 in @entity84 , 74,000 in @entity85 , 71,000 in @entity86 , 76,000 in @entity87 and 38,000 in the @entity88 as of 1am tuesday			1
because a customer is defined as an individual meter , the actual number of people affected is much higher			0
@entity29 spokesman @entity93 told the @entity94 that company ' storm riders ' were monitoring water levels and that when they reached a certain threshold the order would be passed along to cut power			1
he said : ' if the water level comes to a certain point we will have to preemptively power some equipment down , ' @entity93 said			1
' it makes it easier and faster for us to make restorations			0
if we do n’t , it will burn out			0
' @entity29 also cut steam service to 140 customers in @entity17			0
if steam pipes become inundated in cold water , they can explode			0
mr @entity65 said the cuts caused by downed overhead power lines outside major cities could be the trickiest to repair			1
' the overhead is going to be a slog , ' he said			0
in @entity33 , more than 1,900,000 residents are without power , 800,000 in @entity121 , 640,000 in @entity122 , 390,000 in @entity123 , 290,000 in @entity124 and @entity125 , 68,000 in @entity123 , 10,000 in @entity126 and 125,000 in @entity127			1
in all , 6,536,895 customers are without power and the number of outages could still go up as the storm continues			1
night city : the @entity0 skyline remains dark			0
power was cut to much of @entity17 to minimise damage from saltwater shadows : @entity139 in @entity140 during the blackout			1
it could take a week to restore power ' this will be the largest storm - related outage in our history , ' said one power executive after a back - up generator failed , @entity151 's @entity150 began evacuating more than 200 patients to other facilities , including 20 babies from neonatal intensive care , some of them on respirators operating on battery power			1
without power , the hospital had no elevator service , meaning patients had to be carefully carried down staircases and outside into the weather			2
gusts of wind blew their blankets as nurses held ivs and other equipment			0
spokeswoman @entity172 said : ' they evacuated everybody			0
' she could not say what had caused the failure of the hospital ’s emergency systems , which power critical care units there			2
many @entity0 took to the streets to experience the city as it 's rarely seen - dark			2
' it ’s not too often you get to see the city dark , ' @entity183 , 26 , an accountant who was taking pictures on the @entity30 told the @entity188			0
' i have n’t seen lower @entity17 shut down before			0
it ’s kind of amusing , ' said @entity191 , 25 , who walked across the @entity192			0
' it ’s like an apocalypse , like a movie , ' added his friend @entity196			0
the huge explosion took place at a power station on 14th street around 8.30pm , knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the surrounding areas , and it could take a week to restore power			1
amateur video footage shows a fiery explosion followed by two large bursts of blue light at the @entity29 station on the east side of @entity17 , close to the river			2
according a local tv station @entity212 , blue sparks were shooting from the plant and the buildings fell into darkness			0
people living in @entity86 posted cameraphone videos online of the incident			0
it was initially thought that workers were trapped inside , but @entity29 's vice-president later told @entity222 that no one was in or on the building			0
blackness : another @entity0 filmed the explosion from a different angle the initial fireball was followed by two blinding balls of light			2
most of the island below 39 street is without power a power company exec called it ' the largest storm - related outage in our history ' @entity29 engineers were working to restore power to an estimated quarter of a million people in @entity17 who were now without power for at least seven hours			1
' it was scary ! ' said @entity247 , 40 , on east 6th street			0
' i was watching tv , looked outside the window and heard a big explosion and saw a big flash of white light like a firecracker			2
' @entity256 user @entity255 said : ' huge explosion just rocked the @entity258 , everything went dark and i mean dark			2
# @entity3 i 'm now legit scared			1
