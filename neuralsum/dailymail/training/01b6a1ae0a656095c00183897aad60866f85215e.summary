terror experts believe a @entity2 woman dubbed ' @entity3 ' could be a senior @entity4 leader after she was tracked visiting all of the terror group 's stronghold over the past three weeks			1
the mysterious jihadi , who is thought to have only left @entity2 in late - november , uses the @entity10 name @entity11 , although counter-terror analysts refer to her as ' @entity14 '			1
they have been able to follow her visiting @entity4 ' @entity17 strongholds of @entity18 and @entity19 in recent weeks , as well as the @entity21 city of @entity22 , because she has left geocoding activated on her mobile phone , effectively tagging every @entity10 message she posts with details of her location			1
although hundreds of @entity31 women have joined the terror group , the locations she has visited and the speed with which she moves around is unprecedented for a female @entity4 jihadi and suggests she has quickly risen through the ranks of the terror group			1
the experts say they have never seen a female @entity4 fighter moving so frequently and so rapidly , which suggests ' @entity14 ' is operating in a senior capacity , possibly in surveillance or spying role			2
another option is that she is a messenger or courier for the terror group 's leadership and is used to pass covert operational and security details between senior militants who are reluctant to risk having the information intercepted by internet or phone taps			1
whatever the reality , it is clear that ' @entity14 ' - who is understood to be a @entity2 national of @entity75 descent - has made an unprecedented rise within @entity4 since her arrival in @entity17 on december 8			1
before her departure , terror experts had simply considered her a terror sympathiser thanks to her penchant for posting @entity85 messages on @entity10 from @entity86			2
it is not known how she arrived in @entity17 , but she is thought to have left @entity2 sometime after november 23			1
within days of her arrival she had changed her @entity10 banner image to a shocking photograph of the severed head of a @entity17 soldier , according to @entity93			0
she also started posting brazen messages celebrating atrocities by the terror group			2
some woman do join @entity4 all - female police force known as the @entity99			2
however these women still stay in the city in which they operate and do not travel around @entity4 - held territory particularly frequently speaking of her unexplained rise , @entity44 's @entity103 told @entity105 : ' what is really surprising is that in a very short period of time , @entity14 appears to have taken an extremely active role with @entity4			1
' ' we have never seen someone move about this rapidly ... what makes it even more unusual is that she is newly traveled to @entity116			0
having only been there since dec. 8 , it is odd that she would become so active so quickly once arriving , ' he added			0
' based on ' @entity14 's ' locations and congruent battles in these locations , it is been assumed that she is conducting , at least on some level , surveillance for the @entity116 , ' he went on to say			0
although hundreds of @entity31 women are known to have travelled to join @entity4 in the @entity48 , the vast majority of them marry and fighter and settle into a life of cooking , cleaning and childbearing in whatever city they are instructed to settle down			0
most will leave their homes only rarely after marriage and even then usually only to go shopping , so they idea that one woman is buzzing around @entity4 ' territory suggests she is a high ranking militant			2
another possibility is that she married a militant of such prominence that the usual expectation of settling her family in one place is unrealistic , as the home would immediately become a target for @entity31 and @entity154 airstrikes			0
tool : although leader @entity157 ( pictured ) does not have a @entity10 account , several prominent @entity4 commanders do maintain a social media presence			1
the internet has proved an invaluable tool for @entity4 ' @entity14 ' has only used her @entity10 account to send 131 tweets and is understood to have just 145 followers , meaning her social media presence pales in comparison to that of other @entity31 jihadis			0
all of her messages are in @entity171 and their content suggests she is a member @entity175 tribe of @entity75 origin			0
she often posts hate - filled messages about the @entity75 royal family			0
despite the seeming innocuity of her messages , @entity44 have been able to locate the exact homes from which many of them have been sent - proving many of the messages were sent from properties known to be used by ' key players ' within @entity4			0
it is not possible for geocoding to be faked , and many people are unaware that their phone is always giving off information about their whereabouts unless the function is manually turned off			0
although @entity4 leader @entity157 does not have a @entity10 account himself , several prominent @entity4 commanders do maintain a social media presence			1
the internet has so far proved an invaluable tool in @entity4 ' campaign of terror , with the militants using social media to recruit fighters and jihadi brides and to distribute propaganda , including the horrific murder videos of @entity31 hostages .			2
