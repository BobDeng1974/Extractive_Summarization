click here for stats , heat maps and more ! @entity3 must have been taking notes when @entity6 manager @entity5 visited @entity9 ’s @entity8 training ground for lunch on friday			1
for there was certainly an air of the legendary @entity6 sides about @entity9 as they took apart @entity15 at @entity16 — in the first half , at least			1
two of their starting @entity20 were @entity21 — @entity22 and @entity23 — and @entity24 was born there before switching allegiances to represent @entity27			1
all three were integral to this punishing , pin - point passing performance			2
‘ the quality of our football was high , ’ he said			0
‘ we were playing so well , so fast , so fluid			0
' we made the pitch very wide			0
we create spaces to play inside			0
we scored two goals , we should score much more than that			0
’ indeed , the great @entity6 side which won the 1970 @entity108 in @entity109 would have been proud of a move of the highest calibre that led to the opening goal on 11 minutes			2
@entity22 exchanged a tidy one - two with @entity23 down the left - hand side and then passed the ball to @entity52 on the overlap			2
the full - back played the ball back to @entity22 who sent in a cross as nonchalantly as you like which @entity24 controlled with his chest before finishing for his 11th @entity34 goal of the campaign			1
only 25 minutes in and @entity9 were two ahead , although it could have been four or five at that point were it not for @entity65 ’s form in @entity15 ’s goal			1
a simpler move , but as equally clever as the first , doubled the lead			2
@entity22 played a corner from the left along the ground straight to @entity132 , who took one touch to take the ball around @entity72 before burying a low finish			2
four minutes later , @entity15 ’s afternoon became considerably worse when @entity71 was shown a straight red card by referee @entity88 for jumping in to challenge @entity24			1
at this point , @entity15 manager @entity86 feared the worst			2
‘ there ’s been an 8 - 0 in the league this season and when you ’re 2 - 0 down with 10 men at @entity16 with most of the game to play , you fear the worst , ’ he said			1
‘ it was important to get my players focused and make sure we did n’t end up on the wrong end of a high score			0
’ but @entity9 were already running the show as if they had a man advantage before the sending off			2
@entity132 makes it 2 - 0 in the 25th minute as @entity9 cruised to another win in the @entity34 to remain unbeaten hazard shoots and scores to make it 2 - 0 at @entity16 against @entity15 on saturday as @entity3 's side dominated hazard gets a hug from @entity91 as @entity24 runs over to join in the celebration after taking a 2 - 0 lead hazard gives a thumbs up as @entity9 continue to dominate the @entity34 and added another win to their impressive season @entity165 miles @entity9 105.1 65.3 @entity91 90 11.6 7.2 @entity54 90 11.0 6.8 @entity132 90 10.2 6.3 @entity15 98.6 61.3 @entity72 90 11.4 7.1 @entity76 90 11.2 6.9 @entity68 90 10.2 6.3 the @entity166 said ‘ there was a long conversation , with an exchange of ideas about football ’ when @entity5 met @entity3			1
yet @entity9 ’s players were making the most complex football ideas appear simple on the pitch @entity22 struck an outside - of - the - boot curler from the edge of the box on 15 minutes , which @entity65 dived to keep out before smothering a @entity24 effort who had pounced on the rebound			1
moments later and he was at it again			0
@entity22 , seemingly everywhere on the pitch and this time on the right , reached the byline before passing back to @entity49			0
the full - back ’s first - time cross was met by @entity24 , who tried to side - foot home but the ball flew across goal and went wide of a post			1
still wave after wave of blue roared towards @entity15 ’s goal			2
@entity132 sent a ball over the top , which @entity24 managed to control only for @entity65 to come hurtling out to block , then react fastest to punch the ball away from @entity22 ’s feet			1
@entity65 thwarted @entity22 again when another @entity9 move ended with the forward taking a touch and attempting an audacious back - heel			1
there were cried of ‘ @entity204 ’ from the @entity16 crowd , midway through the first half , as a triangle of @entity91 , @entity208 and @entity22 played the ball out from the left corner of their own half , with a cheeky flick from the @entity21 thrown in			1
@entity15 midfielder @entity71 ( right ) is sent off after this tackle on @entity9 striker @entity24 , who goes down in pain @entity24 gets up angrily after the nasty challenge by @entity71 , which saw @entity15 reduced to 10 men with a full half still to play @entity71 gets a sympathetic pat on the back from @entity15 manager @entity86 after being sent off at @entity16 but whatever @entity3 told his players at the break reined them in and the second half was a far more solemn affair , still dominated by @entity9			1
whatever ideas he had shared the day before , this was vintage @entity3 , straight from his personal tactics book			0
kill a team off then suffocate them with possession to ease to victory			0
‘ we decreased the intensity , ’ @entity3 said			0
‘ it made it easier for them			0
’ still their utter domination in @entity15 ’s half allowed for breaks			1
five minutes after the restart @entity51 was denied by @entity65 with a powerful header and on 73 minutes @entity91 threaded a pass between five players to set hazard free inside the box			0
he shimmied to put the goalkeeper off , before taking a shot			0
yet again , @entity65 was in the way			0
@entity22 was among those performing at the highest standard for @entity9 against @entity15 @entity91 ( left ) swaps shirts with @entity74 of @entity15 after another convincing win at @entity16 @entity91 was all over the pitch for @entity9 as his heat map shows			1
