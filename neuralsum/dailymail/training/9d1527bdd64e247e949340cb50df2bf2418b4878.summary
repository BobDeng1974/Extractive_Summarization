the dentist , from @entity29 , said : ' i 've been really blessed in my career so far to work on a variety of animals			2
' i 've operated on everything from a small bat right up to a six tonne elephant			2
' there 's been plenty of carnivores too - lions , tigers , leopards , cheetahs			1
' but the most hair raising experiences have been with the hippos and elephants			0
' i 've had elephants wake up on me in the middle of a surgery , and that can be because they are upset			0
difficult : as well as working on large , fierce predators , dr @entity14 works with some of the world 's smallest			1
he is pictured operating on a hedgehog tricky : the most common complaints from his animal patents are fractures of teeth , infections and abscesses			0

the father - of - two said : ' the first time i worked on a hippopotamus was at @entity138 - that was quite an interesting experience to say the least			0
' anaesthesia in these animals is quite difficult			0
this particular animal halfway through the procedure decided to wake up and get to his feet unexpectedly			0
' in a confined space with a 1.8 tonne animal , it can be rather hair raising			0
' ferocious : although dentists often have to deal with grumpy patients , its doubtful many can be as hot - tempered as this tiger surgery : this elephant has some emergency repair work carried out on its teeth fortunate : despite the wild nature of the majority of his patients , @entity99 , @entity14 has largely avoided injury			1
a lion is pictured in the back of his hatch - back thankfully , despite the wild nature of the majority of his patients , dr @entity14 has largely avoided injury			1
he added : ' i 've been fortunate that often these animals are anaesthetised , so i 'm not usually the first person to come into contact with them when they are in pain and wide awake			0
this is when they are most capable of injuring people			0
' we have had some difficult situations as some of these animals are very huge , so you need to keep your distance			0
looking good : a leopard shows off his new teeth following work by dr @entity14 fascinated : schoolchildren watch at the talented dentist operates on a cheetah good work : dr @entity14 operates on a hippopotamus ' teeth , right , and a cheetah , left ' we try and make sure that everybody will be safe , including the animal , before , during and after the procedure			1
