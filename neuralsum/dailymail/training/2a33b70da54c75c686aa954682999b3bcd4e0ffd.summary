@entity2 's sexting mate @entity3 has revealed her ten point plan for other loose women who might wish to follow her lead and seduce a lusty politician @entity8 ' guide has appeared on xojane.com , the controversial and provocative women ’s lifestyle website described as ‘ where women go when they are being selfish , and where their selfishness is applauded			1
’ much of her unlikely advice reads like a list of lazy clichés for how one might go about seducing a powerful man - consisting of ego massage , coyness and more ego massaging – but considering what @entity2 has previously revealed about himself , every word may well be true			1
her number one advice for snaring a politician is to ‘ indulge his crazy alter - ego , and whatever you do , do n't laugh at him			1
’ @entity8 writes that politicians require a lot of attention , needing to be ‘ coddled like a baby ’ and so she says you must be prepared to be there for them at any time of day or night			2
in her ten point plant for seducing a politician , @entity8 paints a picture of @entity2 as a deeply insecure and incredibly vain man who was constant looking for reassurance , much like a small child @entity8 is refusing to bow out of the public spotlight , much to the chagrin of @entity14 mayoral hopeful @entity2 and his wife @entity66 ‘ basically , pretend like you 're dating the middle school version of yourself			1
like the prepubescent horny teenage girl with all these emotions , ’ she writes , while noting that keeping a straight face is also extremely important			0
she reveals that @entity2 thanked her every time she helped him have an orgasm and that his incessant use of the word ‘ baby ’ when addressing her was ‘ too much			1
’ another of her golden rules is : ‘ find a horny non-politician to finance all the expensive shoes and lingerie pics you 're sexting your politician boyfriend			1
’ according to leather a relationship with a politician is all about excitement and fun but she also recommends having someone else on the go to provide security and help finance your politician sexting			1
‘ with a politician , you have to remember : you 're probably not going to get money			2
you 're in it for the thrill of it , ’ she writes			0
she reveals that at the same time as her affair with @entity2 , she had a ‘ bored , rich man ’ sending her money in return for ‘ selfies ’ - sexy pictures of herself in provocative positions and langurie			1
another lesson from this sexting master is : ‘ figure out his weaknesses early on			2
if he 's insecure , you 've hit gold			1
then torture him by playing hard to get			2
’ in order to gain the upper hand in a game of control with any politician , @entity8 recommends never responding to anything immediately and often waiting up to two days before replying			2
this technique ensured that @entity2 remained interested in her , but she also confesses that she ended up planning her days around him because they talked and sexted so regularly			1
‘ pathetic , but at least he never knew that , ’ she writes			0
@entity8 has revealed that @entity2 would ask her to rate photos of him and be specific about how sexy he looked her next piece of advice is ‘ be a little coy first			1
do n't be so aggressive			0
’ she reveals that when @entity2 first flirted with her she would pretend she did n’t know what was going on which only encouraged him more			2
‘ that just makes them 10 times more interested			2
it 's a little trick , ’ she writes			2
but then with her next golden rule , @entity8 appears to contradict herself : ‘ give him more attention than he 's ever known from a woman			2
tell him he is sexy , and be specific about why he is			2
’ it ’s hardly a revelation but @entity8 writes that ‘ politicians are the biggest attention whores you will ever meet			0
’ @entity8 has revealed that @entity2 used to regularly trash talk current @entity14 major @entity141 she also gives an interesting insight into @entity2 ’s ego when she reveals that he would ask her to be specific about how sexy he was and would ask her to rate photos of him			1
‘ he would really want to know which rant on the house floor was the sexiest			0
what turned me on the most. , ’ she writes			0
according to @entity8 as playing coy you also have to sometimes ‘ play along with whatever he wants ’ in order to drive him wild			1
‘ with @entity2 , i said whatever he wanted to hear , and i took a ton of pictures			1
we talked on the phone all the time			0
i gave him as much attention as he wanted			0
it was like a drug for him , ’ she writes			0
she even referenced an example of sexting between the pair : @entity162 : i was reading your tweets and looking at your pics			0
so i thought i 'd hold your wrists to settle you down			0
@entity167 : ... you have no idea how turned on i am right now			0
i really want you to manhandle me			0
