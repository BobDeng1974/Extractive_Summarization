it looks like any other anonymous office building			2
but this nondescript garage in @entity3 , @entity4 , is where @entity5 is believed to be building its self driving ' @entity9 ' cars			1
one blog claims the address is the hq for the project which could one day take on @entity14			0
the building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named @entity22			1
claims that @entity5 is building a car may seem like a leap , but it is n't the first time such projects have been discussed by the @entity4 firm			1
in an interview last year , @entity5 board member @entity30 said that before his death in 2011 @entity32 had considered building a car			1
he told @entity35 : ' @entity32 was gon na design an @entity36			0
' i think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design			0
' ' two people with knowledge of the project say @entity5 has been working on it and receiving shipments related to its development at a building just minutes from 1 @entity48 , in the town of @entity3 , ' wrote @entity50			1
' we can confirm that @entity5 does indeed have a large presence at the location , and that numerous automotive - related renovations , including an ' auto work area ' and a ' repair garage , ' have been constructed on the premises			1
' the building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named @entity22			1
aside from a sparse website registered through @entity63 less than a year ago that reveals virtually no information about the company , @entity22 has no discernible online presence			1
' we are experts in market research ; helping companies find the relevant market data and industry analysis required to make informed decisions , ' its site says			0
the building is apparently known as @entity73 within @entity5 , and issues visitor passes identical to @entity5 's - minus the logo			1
@entity5 could have an electric car ready to go on sale by 2020 , putting it in direct competition with rivals @entity14 and @entity80 , according to an industry expert			1
evidence is mounting that the tech giant is gearing up to revolutionise the automobile market , just as it did with smartphones and tablets			1
images taken over the past few weeks have shown a prototype car that suggests @entity5 is testing the water - ahead of a release in as little as five years			1
when @entity50 visited @entity22 's headquarters at building ' 175 ' earlier this week , its windows were a ' frosted ' opaque , and security cameras were visible outside			1
@entity94 has claimed that @entity5 could have a car ready by 2020 , based on images of a test car			1
after the first mysterious camera - mounted car was spotted in @entity4 last week , further sightings of @entity5 's minivans have been posted online , with equipment on top ( shown here ) according to @entity105 from @entity94 , automakers ' typically spend five to seven years developing a car '			1
and a 2020 timeframe would underscore @entity5 's ' aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with @entity14 and @entity80 ' both of those are planning to release a sub- Â£ 26,000 ( $ 40,000 ) electric car in 2017 that can travel more than 200 miles ( 320km ) on a single charge			1
@entity117 , author of ' @entity118 , ' a book about the automotive battery industry , said on @entity121 thursday : ' was @entity80 really going to be able to match @entity14 ? @entity5 can			1
' this latest speculation follows sightings of mysterious camera - mounted cars registered to @entity5 in the @entity126 last week			1
at least two videos - one recorded in @entity4 , another filmed in @entity129 - suggest the top - secret project is more widespread than first thought			0
and rumours range from a @entity134 - style mapping service to an electric car that will rival @entity14 or a self - driving van to rival @entity137			0
the @entity4 footage was sent to @entity139 and shows a silver people - carrier driving down a street in @entity142			0
the @entity129 recording was filmed on a highway in @entity145 and uploaded by @entity146			0
this footage shows a white @entity147 fitted with cameras on the roof			0
as the filmmaker pulls alongside the van , they wave at the two men inside			0
the passenger is seen concealing an @entity155 from view , while the driver points to the camera and drives off			0
the @entity129 recording ( pictured ) was filmed in @entity145			0
this footage shows a white @entity147 fitted with cameras on the roof			0
as the filmmaker pulls alongside the van , they wave at the two men inside and the passenger is seen concealing an @entity155 from view other reports have spotted the vans in @entity168 and @entity169			0
the latest vans have n't officially been confirmed as belonging to @entity5 , but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are			1
the far - reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims @entity5 is developing a mapping service			1
with 12 cameras on top of the car , however , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity137 's @entity134			0
plus , reports recently claimed @entity5 has several hundred employees developing an electric car at a secret lab. this project has been dubbed ' @entity9 '			2
this @entity5 research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away - and is being overseen by @entity5 designer sir @entity191			2
@entity5 could , of course , be using the vans for both projects			2
the @entity195 added that hundreds of employees are working on the @entity9 project and boss @entity198 approved the project close to a year ago			0
the @entity4 footage ( pictured ) was sent to @entity139 and shows a silver people - carrier driving down a street in @entity142 these reports followed rumours that @entity5 was developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape and give @entity14 a run for its money			2
' the claims were made in an email from an unnamed @entity5 employee			2
in an interview last year , @entity5 board member @entity30 said that before his death in 2011 , @entity32 had considered building a car			1
an unnamed @entity5 employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape and give @entity14 a run for its money			1
' it followed sightings of an @entity5 - owned car fitted with cameras ( pictured ) in @entity4 in particular , @entity5 may be working on an electric car to rival @entity14 's range ( the @entity229 is pictured ) or the email could be referring to an advanced @entity233 in - car control system that would rival @entity14 's software the head of self - driving cars for @entity137 expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years			1
@entity239 said the cars would still be test vehicles , and @entity137 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians			0
but mr @entity239 would n't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse , saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly			0
he told reporters last month at the @entity250 in @entity251 that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars			0
he told @entity35 : ' @entity32 was gon na design an @entity36			0
i think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design			0
' alternatively , the @entity5 employee 's email could be referring to an advanced @entity233 in - car control system that would rival @entity14 's software			2
the original @entity265 van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog @entity268 in @entity270			0
the blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing , but he refused to give an answer			0
the @entity276 ( @entity277 ) confirmed the vehicle was leased to @entity5			2
last year , footage emerged of a self - driving @entity147 that looked like the current @entity5 minivans			2
when contacted by @entity281 , @entity5 declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was			2
with 12 cameras on top of the mysterious @entity5 car , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity137 's @entity134 ( pictured left )			1
@entity137 launched its @entity134 technology in 2007 , and has refined the technology ever since ( @entity134 screenshot near @entity295 in @entity296 pictured right ) alternatively , the vehicles spotted in @entity4 and @entity129 could be self - driving cars			0
the cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software , for example			2
if @entity5 was developing such systems , they would would rival @entity137 's self - driving cars ( pictured )			2
