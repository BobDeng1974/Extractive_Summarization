@entity1 captain @entity0 has been challenged to raise his game to even greater heights on saturday – to set the tone for a famous victory over the @entity6			1
the 28 - year - old @entity8 flanker delivered a superb individual performance last saturday at @entity10 , emphatically out - playing his iconic opposite number , @entity12 , as the tourists dominated the first test for long periods before subsiding to a 20 - 15 defeat			2
yet , while @entity0 was a massive influence around the field , particularly with his ball - carrying and astute work as a link - man in attack , @entity12 had a greater impact in terms of claiming turn - overs			2
raise your game : @entity0 has been challenged to perform even better in the second test missing link : while @entity0 's ball - carrying was good , he was beaten at the breakdown by @entity12 poacher : the @entity1 skipper has a long way to go to match the @entity6 ' leader in forcing turnovers given the crucial importance of breakdown poaching in a @entity41 7 ’s repertoire , the @entity1 management have re-emphasised to their skipper the need to compete over the ball			1
their demand for a greater ruck return is in keeping with the overall quest for a leap in standards this weekend , from an already impressive base			0
asked to reflect on @entity0 ’s exploits in @entity54 and what was expected of him in the second test , forwards coach @entity57 said : ‘ he was industrious last week			1
i thought he had a good game			0
we have been through his game and there are things he has to be better at , but he knows that			0
he will be the last one off the training field , doing his extras			0
‘ i ’m delighted with how he is going but he knows he ’s going to have to come up another level tomorrow			2
for @entity0 , that means finding another level in everything he does , but there are more breakdowns than anything else in the game and that is one area we coach daily			1
’ @entity79 role : @entity80 ( centre ) moves to the wing on saturday as the back line in reshuffled straight back in : @entity84 takes his place at fy - half having joined the camp after the @entity89 rugby final brothers in arms : the now full - strength @entity1 squad listens to @entity0 during the captain 's run in @entity95 on a high : @entity97 has recovered from an ankle injury and will partner @entity99 in the centres @entity1 have recalled @entity101 at blindside flanker in place of @entity104 , who was arguably their most effective breakdown asset at @entity10			1
but @entity101 and @entity0 – aided and abetted by the likes of lock pair @entity108 and @entity109 – led a ferocious rucking onslaught 18 months which was at the heart of a record victory over @entity6 at @entity113			1
that same raging intensity at the collision areas will be vital this time , if @entity1 are to disrupt the hosts ’ possession and ensure their backs have quick ball to work with			2
that would allow them to set about dispelling the local perception that they want to play a slow , turgid game ; a view which @entity57 took his turn to dismiss out of hand			1
recalled : @entity101 will play at blindside flanker in the only change to the starting forward pack on a high : @entity101 comes in for @entity104 after captaining @entity132 to victory over @entity134 @entity135 : @entity136 will call on the likes of @entity138 from the bench at @entity140 perfect conditions : @entity1 and the @entity6 will go into battle under the roof at the @entity145 ' home ground ‘ we want to play quick , ’ said the former prop			1
‘ i was alarmed by some of the comments in the press this week saying we want to slow the game down			0
we want to play quick because we have a lightning - fast backline and a dynamic group of forwards , and that stadium will suit us			2
‘ in my opinion , the squad is a lot fitter – and i ’m sure the data would back that up as well – than it ever has been			0
that is certainly helping the way we want to play			2
we want to play a challenging game and we want every tool available for a driving game or a quick game			0
’ there was a degree of doubt about whether or not @entity140 – with its roof - covered surface – would suit @entity1 ’s kickers , after @entity171 had some trouble shooting at goal there during the last @entity174			2
but the indications from training there this morning are that @entity84 and @entity177 endured no such problems			0
kicking game : @entity84 will be playing under a roof in the second test waiting game : @entity184 hooker @entity183 will be back - up for @entity186 , who impressed in the first test to keep his starting spot @entity190 recovery : scrum - half @entity191 starts after missing the first test with a shoulder injury warming up : @entity1 ease into their session in the stadium nicknamed the @entity196 warming up : @entity1 ease into their session in the stadium nicknamed the @entity196 testing time : while @entity199 ( left ) is rock solid under the high ball , @entity80 ( right ) will be peppered on the wing ‘ @entity203 missed a shot this morning , ’ said @entity57			1
‘ i was marvelling at how easy he makes it			0
@entity207 , i ’m glad i never had to do that for a living , under that pressure , but they both ( @entity84 and @entity177 ) kicked well this morning			0
’ @entity1 have stocked their bench with high - calibre , heavyweight replacements , in the hope of blasting to victory in the final quarter against a tiring @entity6 defence			1
there will be a major onus on the visitors to maintain their intensity levels for the entire match , which they were unable to do last weekend			0
‘ you have to be able to play until the last 10 seconds , ’ said @entity57			1
‘ @entity6 have shown that , particularly in their victory in @entity226 last autumn			1
we have to be pounding away at the end there			0
that 's something we are constantly speaking about ; being there and accurate in the last few seconds of the game			0
it 's certainly a work - on for us			0
’ so near , yet so far : @entity0 saw @entity1 concede a late try against @entity6 in the first test on the charge : @entity0 will look to lead @entity1 to victory in the second test			1

@entity1 lost to @entity6 *narrowly* in the first test
captain @entity0 challenged to play even better and lead his side to victory
@entity57 wants @entity0 to find another level
