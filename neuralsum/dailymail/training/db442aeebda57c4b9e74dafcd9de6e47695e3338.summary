by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:23 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 07:44 est , 12 april 2012 @entity3 @entity2 has issued an apology after being criticised for a @entity6 message that urged people to rush home during wednesday 's tsunami scare and order a bucket of @entity3 chicken			1
as people were being urged to evacuate from beach areas , the company posted this message : ' let 's hurry home and follow the earthquake news			1
and do n't forget to order your favorite @entity3 menu			1
' it prompted hundreds of angry comments on a variety of @entity2 web forums that denounced the company as insensitive and selfish			1
by thursday the message was removed and replaced by one that asked for forgiveness			2
wednesday 's earthquakes in @entity29 revived memories of the 2004 @entity32 tsunami that claimed 230,000 lives , including more than 8,000 people in @entity2			1
@entity35 : clogged streets in @entity37 as people grab whatever vehicles they can find and head to the hills			0
there were fears that a tsunami could be as bad as the one on @entity45 in 2004 panic : people in @entity48 scramble to ecsape the city after a tsunami warning was issued it follows news that five people died after suffering heart attacks with several more injured in the aftermath of yesterday 's @entity29 tsunami earthquakes that sparked mass panic			1
two powerful earthquakes in the region 's westernmost province , @entity48 , triggered hysteria for millions of people as they fled high ground when a tsunami warning was raised			1
@entity48 , close to the epicenter of yesterday 's tremors , bore the brunt of the tidal wave eight years ago but millions were breathing a sigh of relief after the tsunami warnings were lifted			1
life quickly got back to normal today as residents assessed the damage left by the earthquake , consisting of cracks in the walls of houses and structural damage to a bridge			0
@entity81 , 45 , who lost one of his sons in the 2004 disaster that killed 170,000 people in @entity48 alone , said : ' i really feel my prayers were answered			1
' we 've gone through enough trauma already			1
' buildings shook for four minutes and there were reports of people jumping from windows in a desperate attempt to escape			0
patients also poured out of hospitals , some with drips still attached to their arms			0
in some places , electricity was briefly cut			0
there were also scenes of panic in @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 in @entity109 as terrified people fled their homes and offices			2
then , two hours later , a massive aftershock - with a similarly huge magnitude of 8.2 - struck only 110 miles further out to sea , unleashing even more panic			2
tsunami waves , measuring 3ft in height , hit @entity119 , the island @entity48 is on			0
but experts discovered that both quakes were the wrong type to issue a disaster and the warnings were lifted			1
@entity35 : residents of @entity48 evacuate following a tsunami warning after two massive earthquakes piled up : a father loads his wife and four children on to his moped and drives off @entity132 , seismologist at the @entity134 geological survey who has studied @entity119 's fault lines , said the earthquake was a strike - slip quake			1
the tsunami triggering 9.1 - magnitude earthquake of seven years go - which killed 230,000 people , three quarters of whom lived in @entity48 - was a thrust quake , which causes the sea bed to flip up			1
the earthquakes occurred as prime minister @entity147 visited @entity29 's capital , @entity149 , which is 1,600 miles south - east of @entity48 and on a different island , @entity151			1
no tremors were felt there			0
he told president @entity155 : ‘ our thoughts should be with those who are affected			0
‘ @entity134 of course stands ready to help if help is required			0
‘ we will stand with you and your government and your people at this time of worry			0
fears : lines in the ocean show how far tsunami waves could travel in just a few hours impact : both quakes hit just a few hundred miles off the coast of @entity48			2
the first hit at 8.38am gmt. it was followed by a massive aftershock ( marked 2 ) at 10.43am gmt. the black star indicates the epicentre of the 2004 earthquake that triggered a devastating tsunami			1
the region is prone to tsunamis because there are several tectonic plates moving about on the floor of the expansive @entity183 , pictured right strike point : the spot where the earthquake hit			2
the bubbles represent previous quakes @entity190 : an elderly woman is helped by her family as they attempt to flee the city elsewhere : tourists in @entity197 , southern @entity2 head to high ground amid fears a tsunami could strike there again moving out : @entity109 leave their houses after the government announced a tsunami warning			1
it was later repealed along with most other countries in the @entity183 leaving : office workers evacuate from buildings in @entity208 , @entity109 after tremors were felt there gone in a blur : acehnese people escape in motorcycles and tuk tuks concern : an @entity216 woman with a child tries to stop a car to go to higher ground after tremors are felt mr @entity155 moved to calm nerves , saying that there appeared to be no serious casualties and local residents had been taken to safety			2
he added that ‘ as of this time there is no threat of tsunami ’ - despite an international warning being issued			0
he added : ‘ the situation is under control so far			0
it is a very different situation from 2004 when @entity48 was faced with a deadly tsunami			2
’ the tremor was felt in @entity234 , @entity2 , @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity107			2
a tsunami warning has been issued for cities all along the coast of @entity119			0
visit : @entity147 talks to @entity29 president @entity155 after his arrival at the @entity242 in @entity149 today there were also reports of the water level dropping in the @entity2 resort of @entity197 - a sign that the sea is drawing back in preparation to launch an enormous wave			1
a tsunami watch means there is the potential for a tsunami , not that one is imminent			0
since 2004 such warnings are issued after every earthquake in the @entity257			2
@entity29 straddles a series of fault lines that makes the vast island nation prone to volcanic and seismic activity			2
last year 's devastating tsunami in @entity263 was triggered by an earthquake with a similar hypocentre depth 20 miles below the surface			1
the earthquake that struck off the coast of @entity48 today has chilling parallels with the disaster that obliterated the region on @entity45 , 2004			1
more than 230,000 thousand people were killed by the resulting tsunami that swept inland and washed away homes			1
a further 250,000 people were injured by the catastrophe , which was the sixth deadliest ever recorded			0
but so unpredictable is the whim of nature that today 's earthquake - despite being almost as powerful - has not had the same fatal effects			2
the tsunami that struck in the @entity183 in 2004 , was caused by a 9.1 magnitude earthquake			1
today 's earthquake measures 8.7 on the @entity284			2
damage : residents are swept away in the raging torrents that engulfed parts of @entity109 after the earthquake off the coast of @entity29 in 2004			1
the quake was more catastrophic than the recent one flood waters in @entity2 lap around the damage homes that were crushed by the tsunami that struck off @entity29 in 2004 power : a wall of water crashes over a street in @entity299 , @entity263 during last year 's devastating tsunami there although there is a slight difference in the strength , it would still be strong enough to cause significant damage			1
the biggest tsunami ever recorded was triggered by an 8.3 magnitude earthquake in @entity308 , @entity309 on july 9 , 1958 - less powerful than the most recent quake in @entity29			1
and the @entity263 2011 tsunami was brought on by 9.0 magnitude quake			0
so why has today 's quake not caused a killer tsunami ? the quake struck 20.5 miles below the sea bed whereas the one in 2004 was slightly closer to the sea at just 19 miles			1
however , due to continual movement of the plates over the last eight years there position today will be different to when disaster struck before			0
the position of the plates when one of them breaks and causes seismic waves is a vital part of what causes the tsunami			0
although both earthquakes formed on the fault line where the @entity107 and @entity335 plates meet , today 's earthquake did not cause disruption in the water			2
@entity132 , seismologist at the @entity134 geological survey who has studied the fault lines off @entity119 in northern @entity29 said that today 's tremor was a strike - slip quake , not a thrust quake which causes the sea bed to flip up			1
it is not impossible for strike - slip earthquakes to generate vertical uplift of water , ' when i first saw this was an 8.7 near @entity119 , i was fearing the worst , ' mr @entity132 said			0
' but as soon as i discovered what type of earthquake it was , then i felt a lot better			2
' mega tsunamis strike when the plates create changes in the water pressure			0
the plates will have moved under each other differently today than how they did in 2004 , creating less change in the water pressure			0
moreover , researchers studying the 2004 quake found small but significant jumps of between 5 and 10 millimeters at stations as far as 3000 kilometres from the epicentre			0
they also found the rupture was 1000km long and spread rapidly northwards from its origin			0
this damage makes a significant difference because it is the ' snapping ' motion of the earth 's crust below the ocean that causes movement in the water above it			0
if the plates do not displace a large amount of water , the power of the underwater waves will be less			0
in this case it appears that even though an underwater earthquake has been recorded , the disruption to the sea bed has not been strong enough to create momentum in the water			0
the analyusts from @entity390 ( @entity390 ) in @entity391 studied gps data showing that the damage caused by the earthquake was at least 200km north of its epicentre			0
the severity and location of the damage to seabed caused by today 's earthquake is still unclear			2
one aspect of tsunamis that is within man 's control are the warnings that can be put in place			1
in 2004 there were no alerts telling people that a tidal wave was on its way			1
following the damage , the @entity412 was established following a @entity415 conference in @entity416 , @entity263 , in january 2005			0
seventeen seismic stations were placed in the ocean to detect plate movements and tremors			0
these sensors then pass the information to two recording stations which sound sirens and even make automated phone calls and send text messages and emails to residents			0
