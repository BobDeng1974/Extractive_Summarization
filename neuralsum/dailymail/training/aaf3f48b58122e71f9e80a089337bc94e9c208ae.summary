the manager is due to take part in a question - and - answer session in downtown @entity12 on thursday despite his @entity4 team being just a week away from their first game against @entity15			0
grilling : @entity1 will sit down with fans in @entity5 ahead of the @entity17 the willingness of @entity1 to engage with fans contrasts with the approach of his predecessors , who might have taken part in stage - managed sponsorship events in the @entity24 but never on the road with a tournament beckoning			1
after a remarkably calm build - up to @entity28 , @entity1 ’s dilemma over whether to play the out - of - form @entity30 in @entity32 on june 14 will surely be a subject he is asked about			0
and fans will not countenance @entity37 spin doctors deciding what questions can be put to @entity1 , with even a query about @entity40 being ruled out at the last press briefing			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity42 , the sports psychiatrist with the @entity4 @entity17 party , sat in on @entity1 ’s pre-match media conferences at @entity45 last thursday			1
but it would have been far more beneficial for him to witness @entity1 in interviews straight after games when the pressure on any manager is so much greater			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity51 is not just cashing in on the @entity17			0
legends 10 , run by former @entity54 director @entity53 , have bought the @entity28 icon ’s intellectual property rights and are doing as many deals as possible to take advantage of the 2016 @entity60 build - up			0
it will not be one of his bigger paydays but @entity51 has agreed to do an interview with @entity66 which the @entity68 football presenter is flying out to @entity28 early to record			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity70 chief executive @entity69 , who has promised to meet various anti-discrimination groups in the wake of his sexist email exchanges with tv rights lawyer @entity74 , has started at the top			2
@entity69 had a meeting at the @entity77 last week with @entity79 confederation chief @entity78 , who heads @entity81 ’s anti-discrimination task force			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... former @entity37 vice-chairman @entity82 , one of football ’s great networkers , is expected to help @entity85 implement his commission findings			1
@entity37 chairman @entity85 , who is likely to receive a negative reception to his b team proposals at the @entity90 conference this week , needs all the support he can get to ensure his recommendations are n’t kicked into the long grass			2
and @entity82 , a close contact of @entity85 ’s since they were both part of the @entity70 formation group , is understood to have discussed how he could assist — having strong views himself on improving the @entity4 team			1
an official role for @entity82 has yet to be agreed			2

minister for sport @entity113 will be in @entity115 for the @entity117 match on june 19			0
@entity81 snub to @entity118 the email files of disgraced former @entity121 member @entity120 might not be the smoking gun that derails the @entity123 , but they give more detail about @entity4 ’s doomed 2018 bid			2
it is now clear that in the build - up to the @entity129 election , @entity130 , prince @entity131 and @entity118 all failed to get time with @entity133 , whose vote they were courting			0
meanwhile , just as the @entity70 are considering a police complaint over secretary @entity138 acquiring chief executive @entity69 ’s private emails so , it is understood , is @entity133 over how the @entity141 gained possession of his cache			2
