by @entity0 tiny sponges could be the unlikely key to saving the victims of gunshot wounds			2
researchers have developed a small syringe that can simply be injected into the would			1
the team behind it say it could save dozens of lives , as it can seal the wound within fifteen seconds			2
the @entity12 , a small syringe of expandable sponges that can simply be injected into a gunshot would to seal it			1
the key to the system is a specially developed syringe			2
it can inject dozens of small sponges into the wound			1
the sponges are coated in a clotting agent and compressed			2
in the wound , the @entity12 sponges expand and create a barrier to blood flow , present a large surface area for clotting			1
they also provide gentle pressure , freeing up medical staff			0
' @entity37 works by applying a group of small , rapidly - expanding sponges into a wound cavity using a lightweight applicator , ' @entity34 , the firm behind the gadget , said			1

no direct manual pressure is required			0
two applicator sizes are under development : a 30 mm diameter applicator for larger wounds and a 12 mm diameter applicator for narrow wound tracks			0
the @entity37 sponges are made from standard medical sponge that is coated with a hemostatic agent and compressed			0
the invention already has fans in the @entity58			1

' hemorrhage is the leading cause of death on the battlefield , and one of our most challenging forms of hemorrhage has been junctional [ the junction of the legs or arms with the torso ] hemorrhage , or hemorrhage from deep wounds on which it is impossible to put a tourniquet or apply manual compression externally , said dr. @entity80 , portfolio manager of the @entity81 and @entity82			0
' this @entity84 device allows the haemostatic material to be put [ injected ] into the wound tract , and then it expands from the inside out , putting pressure on the bleeding to stop it , ' said @entity80			1
' it is a capability that has never existed before , and can be used in the field setting by medics , possibly even with buddy aid [ first aid administered by battlefield ' battle buddies ' ]			0
' how it works : ' @entity37 works by applying a group of small , rapidly - expanding sponges into a wound cavity using a lightweight applicator , ' @entity34 , the firm behind the gadget , said			1
' this project started with the @entity104 , ' he said			0
' the research looked promising enough that the @entity58 chose to fund it through its completion			2
' @entity80 said that he expects that units will be able to purchase the device for themselves			0
he also believes that the @entity84 device will transcend military medical use and find its way into the field of civilian medicine for widespread public use in trauma scenarios .			0
