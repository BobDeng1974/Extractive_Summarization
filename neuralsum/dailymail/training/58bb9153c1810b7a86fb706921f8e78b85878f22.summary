the draft gives @entity3 15 days to comply or risk the adoption of tougher measures			0
@entity7 , along with @entity140 and @entity283 , are hoping that a briefing tomorrow about the @entity267 ’s findings by secretary - general @entity286 and @entity288 ’s prime minister @entity287 will help convince the @entity256 not to use their veto			2
@entity256 ’s @entity226 envoy @entity290 said he could n’t see the resolution being passed as it stood , but added that negotiations would continue down to the wire			2
