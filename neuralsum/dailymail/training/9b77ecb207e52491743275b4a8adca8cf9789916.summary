by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 01:00 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 13:27 est , 22 may 2012 former president @entity3 's foundation expressed outrage today after a vial said to contain his blood taken after a failed assassination attempt was put up for sale in an online auction			1
the @entity11 - based @entity10 claimed the blood was from a sample taken after the president was shot and seriously wounded outside a @entity15 hotel in 1981			1
as the bidding passed $ 9,700 yesterday , @entity16 , executive director of the foundation , threatened legal action and said it would fight to stop ' this craven act			1
' presidential fluid : the seller 's mother asked the director of the lab that handled @entity3 's blood tests where she worked if she could keep the tube he said the hospital where mr @entity3 had been treated had assured the foundation that an inquiry was under way into ' how something like this could possibly happen			1
' the website for @entity10 showed a picture of a blood - filled vial with a label stuck to it showing the president 's name			2
the glass vial is five inches long with a half - inch diameter , and has a white label with purple ink writing attached to it			2
the label reads ' @entity46 ' , lists the president 's patient identification and the exact date of the assassination , march 30th 1981			2
@entity3 's birth date is incorrectly listed as february 2nd 1911			1
his actual birthday is february 6th of that year			0
mr @entity3 suffered a punctured lung and internal bleeding when he was shot by @entity55 outside the @entity56			1
@entity3 survived the assassination attempt at the @entity56 in @entity15 where he was for a speech			1
sale : a seller whose deceased mother gave him a vial of @entity3 's blood she had kept since his 1981 assassination attempt is auctioning the tube @entity67 was later found not guilty by reason of insanity			1
he is allowed to visit his family away from the psychiatric hospital where he is being treated			0
also posted on the @entity10 site was an image of a form from @entity75 that lists @entity77 @entity76 as the source of the vial , along with a statement from an unnamed person offering the vial for sale			0
the seller wrote that the vial came from his or her late mother , who took it from her workplace at @entity91 - based @entity75 , where blood work and testing were done for @entity77 hospital			2
the seller said he had contacted the @entity97 - based @entity96 and @entity98 , which is run by the late president 's foundation , months ago and had been told that mr @entity3 's family would like to have the vial given to them			1
in a letter of provenance on the site , the seller claims : ' the test tube and the lab slip that i have are for his blood work to be tested for lead on			0
the testing was completed and the test tube was sitting on my mother 's desk			0
' at the end of the week , she asked the director of her laboratory if she could keep the paper work and the test tube			0
the director of the lab told her no problem and really never gave it a second thought			0
it has been in my family ever since			0
' attempt : @entity3 waves during his time at a @entity15 hotel moments before he is shot in a near assassination on his life next move : the son or daughter of the woman who kept the blood tube after @entity3 's assassination attempt ( pictured ) tried to figure out what to do with the vial the blood residue remained with her family for three decades			1
after the seller 's father passed away in 2009 and the mother died in late 2010 , the seller inherited the presidential fluid			0
the seller said that an official at the @entity96 had checked with lawyers , the @entity152 , the @entity153 and other agencies before telling him or her ' everything was ok '			0
' since 30 years had passed by , he thought that it was simply something that was of no importance at this time and that i was free to do with whatever i wanted with it			2
' he then stated that he felt the family would be interested in it being returned to them and if i was interested in doing so to contact him and he would make all of the arrangements			0
' i told him that i did n't think that was something that i was going to consider , since i had served under pres. @entity3 when he was my commander in chief when i was in the army from ' 87 - ' 91 and that i was a real fan of @entity171 and felt that pres. @entity3 himself would rather see me sell it rather than donating it			1
' ' real fan ' : the seller really liked @entity3 's economic policies so decided to sell the blood tested when he was wounded in 1981 instead of donating it the seller claimed to have contacted the @entity3 national library and national archives about whether they would be willing to purchase the blood			1
but neither entities were interested in the vial and paperwork - though they did threaten to have the seller investigated by police over his or her possession of the artifacts			2
mr @entity3 , who went on to serve two terms as president , died at the age 93 in 2004			2
a spokesman for @entity10 was unavailable for comment yesterday			0
