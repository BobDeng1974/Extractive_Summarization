nearly half of children have reached the age of 11 without using public transport - and most children now have mobile phones today 's children are so cosseted that nearly half have never set foot on a bus or train , a major study reveals today			1
the research paints a picture of a gadget - obsessed generation who spend hours in front of screens but enjoy limited freedom			1
it found 48 per cent had reached the age of 11 without ever travelling on public transport – even with an adult			1
but more than one in six spent at least three hours a day watching television or dvds on a computer			1
for the most heavily addicted , the daily time spent in front of a screen could add up to seven hours			1
the findings come from the state - funded @entity30 , which is tracking 13,000 @entity33 children born in 2000 , 2001 or 2002			1
a snapshot taken when the participants were 11 shows the extent to which childhoods have changed in half a generation			2
three - quarters now have their own mobile phone and six in ten have a television in their bedroom			1
contact with friends is just as likely to be via technology – either mobile phone calls or social networking sites – as it is to be face - to - face			1
‘ social media undoubtedly plays a central role in the lives of most of these children , ’ the study said			2
‘ with the evolution of social networking sites such as @entity57 and @entity58 , friends have become redefined as not only those they see but virtual friends			0
‘ communication with many of them exists solely in a virtual world			0
’ despite this , not all children were constantly using social media			0
the study found 46 per cent of boys and 31 per cent of girls never messaged their friends			2
researchers asked parents were how much freedom they gave their children to make journeys on their own around the local area			0
‘ the survey clearly showed the ever - greater reliance on the family car for all journeys , ’ the report said			0
‘ very few children had travelled on public transport on their own ( four per cent ) , while a surprisingly high proportion ( 48 per cent ) had never even travelled on public transport with an adult			1
’ more than one in six spent at least three hours a day watching television or on a computer , a study revealed just over half of boys and 44 per cent of girls were allowed to make journeys on their own on foot			1
boys were also more likely to be allowed to play unsupervised with their friends			0
fifty - one per cent said they did so most weekends compared to 43 per cent of girls			0
around a quarter of parents did not allowed their children any unsupervised time with friends			2
the study also shed light on tensions within the family			0
twenty - nine per cent of parents said they had ‘ frequent battles ’ with their 11 - year - old			2
and around one in ten disciplined their children by sending them to their bedrooms or denying them treats			0
previous research has suggested the emergence of a ‘ sensible ’ generation			0
the @entity117 echoed these findings , saying the behaviour of 11 - year - olds ‘ was giving little cause for concern ’			1
seventy - six per cent said they had been bullied by a sibling and 58 per cent reported being picked on by another child			0
but around half – 52 per cent – rated themselves as being ‘ completely happy ’ .			0
