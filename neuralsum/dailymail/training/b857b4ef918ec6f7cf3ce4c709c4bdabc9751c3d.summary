by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 10:02 est , 4 march 2014 it is probably not what the driver had in mind when he forked out £ 230,000 for one of the most luxurious rides going			1
but today an unknown motorist discovered that his white @entity9 has been written off after a dramatic - looking crash in which , thankfully , nobody was hurt			1
the person behind the wheel lost control of the performance car and smashed it into a tree , damaging it beyond repair			1
write - off : the £ 230,000 white @entity9 was seen wrecked at the side of the road wreckage : a passing motorist pictured the totalled vehicle , which the driver had lost control of repairs : rescue crew tinkered with the damaged car before it became clear it was unsalvageable impact came after the care came off the road , shooting 20 yards up a grassy embankment before being stopped in its tracks by a tree			1
the crash made a mangled wreck of the 208mph , 651bhp vehicle , which was photographed by passing drivers on the southbound carriageway of the @entity40 in @entity41			1
@entity42 , of @entity43 , said : ' my friend called me up to say there had been a bad crash on the road involving a really nice @entity9			1
' i drove there myself to have a look and it was a complete write off			0
it 's such a beautiful car and i 'm sure the owner 's absolutely devastated			1
supercar : the @entity9 has a top speed of 208mph and features mounted tv screens for rear passengers ' but the main thing is that he 's ok			1
a car can be replaced at the end of the day although it 's going to cost quite an amount to replace that			2
' police confirmed that the 6.2 - litre car , which boasts a leather interior and tv screens for rear passengers , was the only vehicle involved in the accident			1
a spokesperson for @entity65 said : ' there will be no further involvement from the police			0
' when the @entity9 was launched in 2011 , motoring editor @entity76 took one for a spin			0
here 's what he had to say ... @entity9 has really put the boot in with this shooting brakestyle , four - wheel drive supercar			2
designed by legendary @entity85 styling house @entity83 , it aims for practicality with power			0
the new @entity9 is a sexier , faster , replacement for the 612 scaglietti @entity89 and combines style with massive on - road presence			0
it 's @entity9 's first production four - wheel drive , sending power to the front wheels as well as the back if the rear wheels ca n't transmit all the power the driver is demanding			2
@entity9 says it 'll take four people plus luggage with 450 litres of boot space - slightly less than a @entity103 estate			0
style : motoring editor @entity105 was taken by the car 's ' massive on - road presence ' it bears more than a passing resemblance to @entity111 classics of the @entity112 - the @entity113 and @entity114			2
expect @entity115 , and maybe @entity116 , to follow suit			0
the @entity9 boasts colossal performance with 0 - 62mph in 3.7 neckwrenching seconds and 0 - to - 124mph in 11 seconds using the computer - operated launch control			0
with a top speed of 208mph , it 's totally relaxed cruising at motorway speeds , as the fabulous sound from the v12 engine is directed into the cabin			1
despite an enormous 651bhp from its 6.2 litre engine , it 's easy to drive			0
its seven - speed @entity131 dual clutch gearbox can even be left in automatic if you feel lazy			2
in terms of pure aesthetics , the styling is rather ungainly from some angles			0
but would i care ? nah .			0

the supercar , top speed 208mph , came off the @entity40 and hit a tree on *sunday*
driver was *unhurt* in the crash in @entity41 and nobody else was involved
but the luxurious car , with leather interior and tv screens , is beyond repair
