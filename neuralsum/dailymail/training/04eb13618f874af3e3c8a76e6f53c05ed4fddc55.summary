in a joint statement as they brought the four surviving copies together , the library and the cathedrals said : ' @entity32 could surely never have anticipated the enduring global legacy of @entity1 when he agreed to its terms in 1215			1

. staff at the @entity206 in the early 19th century also made it harder to read by using outdated techniques to flatten and mount the historic document			0
the @entity23 @entity1 has been at the @entity23 since the 13th century			1
it may have been deposited there by @entity211 , @entity212 and one of @entity32 ’s chief advisers , or it may have come from @entity215 , who supervised the building of the @entity23 from the 1220s			2
