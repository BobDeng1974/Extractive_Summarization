as lithe male models sashayed their way down the @entity4 runway at @entity5 's this afternoon you 'd be mistaken for thinking they 'd showed up for the wrong show			1
for this season the fashion house clearly wants the gentleman in your life to explore his feminine side with outfits including pussybow blouses , lace tops and floral patterned vests			2
these items , worn with low slung , wide legged trousers , seemed to be the mainstay of the company 's autumn / winter 2015 collection , with many models also sporting a pair of the @entity25 brand 's classic leather loafers			1
the stars of @entity4 's fashion show in @entity5 wore feminine - looking clothing such as a frilled shirt ( left ) and pussybow blouse ( right ) this is not the first time @entity4 has decided to go for feminine prints for men			1
the label 's spring / summer 2014 collection was made up of floral suits and shirts , with clashing patterns on the top and bottom			0
the models it seemed too had been chosen with an androgynous look in mind with soft features and unstyled hair			0
perhaps even more controversial than the clothes themselves was the fact that some of the models were wearing sandals with socks - thought to be one of the all time fashion no - nos. these out - there designs follow @entity59 collections : men where the models were dressed in all manner of bizarre get up			1
at the @entity63 show they had their faces adorned with @entity65 , with some of the masks so big the models could barely see in front of them			0
at the @entity4 show today one gentleman wore a floral vest with a neck tie detail ( left ) another wore his pussy bow blouse with a beret ( right ) then at the house of @entity76 the models were photographed coming down the runway with plastic bags on their heads and others had the same emblazoned on their jumpers			1
then at the @entity85 show and @entity86 in @entity5 it was all about giant winter warmers			0
while @entity85 controversially showed giant fur hats and huge lined coats , @entity86 had models walk down the runway in giant scarfs			0
@entity5 men 's fashion week started in earnest on friday with brands showing off the @entity97 ranges			2
stars such as @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 are all in town to see the shows			0
this red lace number - worn with socks and sandals and dark orange trousers - would be just as at home in a woman 's wardrobe over-sized coats were also on show at @entity4 in @entity5 with one model a dead ringer for @entity115 's @entity115 ( right )			2
