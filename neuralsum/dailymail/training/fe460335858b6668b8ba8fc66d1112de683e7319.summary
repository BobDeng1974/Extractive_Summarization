many of the women signing up for ultra marathons and marathons today will take for granted their right to compete			1
but only 40 years ago , it was not an option			2
as recently as the @entity8 , it was thought to be too dangerous for women to run long distances			1
it was n't until the @entity12 that big city marathons began to allow women to compete			1
and women were not allowed to take part in the marathon at the @entity18 until 1984			1
since then , women 's participation in marathons , ultra marathons , and adventure races has flourished			1
not just for macho men : a quarter of the @entity27 entrants are now female one race series involving a tough army - style assault course is attracting an increasing number of female participants despite being sponsored by a men 's magazine			1
the @entity27 series is not just about males proving their strength and stamina as now a quarter of the 18,500 entrants are women			1
the race , held in cities across the @entity44 , involves running at least 10k over an urban assault course where challenges including swinging across monkey bars , scaling high walls and scrambling through mud under a net			0
@entity51 , founder of @entity52 , who organises the @entity27 races and other endurance events , said : ' over the past two years we have seen a significant increase in women taking part in our events			1
' there could be several reasons for this increase , but in my opinion i believe that a lot of women are using endurance races and events as a target to help motivate them to lose weight , or improve their fitness			2
' one of the women who has decided to take part in the obstacle course race for the first time this year is @entity77 , 35 , who lives in @entity78			2
no walk in the park : the obstacle course races involve scaling walls and crawling under nets through the mud she told @entity86 : ' i have signed up for it as part of a series of challenges i have committed to doing for a year to raise money for charity whilst also getting fit			0
' i wanted a wide range of challenges , rather than just running straightforward @entity94			0
i also wanted to do events where you could enter as a team , so i am doing this with a group of former colleagues			0
' despite the masculine name of the series , @entity77 said she was n't put off entering the @entity27 event in @entity104 this november			1
she said : ' it has never crossed my mind that these events would be male dominated			0
it 's great to see more women getting involved			2
' meanwhile , another of @entity52 events - @entity113 - is also appealling to more women			0
at this year 's race , which follows an off - road route along @entity117 , 40 per cent of the entrants were female			1
up for the challenge : @entity77 , 35 , left , is training for a @entity27 event , while @entity121 , 37 , finished @entity122 @entity121 , 37 , from @entity123 , in @entity124 , was the first woman to finish the 69 mile run in 2014			2
she said : ' i 've met lots of ultra runners / adventure racers in the last few years and i think the women are definitely tougher than the men ! once we put our minds to something we usually follow it through to the end , no matter how hard it gets			1
' we 're used to juggling jobs , kids , hobbies and home life			0
it 's often a struggle to fit everything in but i think that 's what makes us more determined to finish these races			2
dropping out is n't an option			0
' the women taking part in such long distance events have some inspiring role models in ultra distance runners like @entity153 and @entity154			1
@entity153 , 37 , from @entity155 , has won @entity158 du @entity156 five times and in 2013 set a new world record running from @entity161 to @entity162 in @entity163			0
meanwhile , @entity154 , 35 , became the first @entity44 woman to win the @entity165 - an undulating 55 mile race - this year			0
they have proved that women can run for as long as men - and often at a faster pace than them as well			2
@entity171 : @entity172 campaigned for women to be able to run marathons and was the first to complete the @entity175 , despite race officials physically trying to stop her @entity172 was one of the women who campaigned for the right for women to compete in the marathon			1
she became a figurehead for the cause after she took part in the @entity175 in 1967 - and organisers physically tried to remove her from the race when they realised she was a woman			0
@entity172 , now 67 , said of her desire to take part : ' i was just a kid who wanted to run , and was there as a reward from my coach who did n't believe that a woman could run the distance			2
' i had heard that other women had run marathon distances and that one woman in 1966 ran the @entity175 but without a bib number , so i was n't trying to break any barriers			1
it was n't until a race official attacked me during the run did i become determined to finish and speak out on behalf of all women			1
' she did finish and went on to run many more marathons - as well as helping other women have the right to do the same			2
she said joining the successful campaign to make the women 's marathon an @entity18 event by 1984 was her biggest ' life victory '			1
she said : ' i knew when the world saw women in the most difficult of all running events , competing in the most important and prestigious sports event the @entity18 it would change world attitudes about women 's capability			1
everyone everywhere understands that 26.2 miles ( or 42.2 km , ) is a long way to run , and when they see women doing it they know that women can do anything and should be allowed to participate			1
' ten years ago , just 13 people set off together on a timed 5k run around their local park in @entity155			0
this weekend thousands around the world will do the same thing thanks to the growth of the parkrun organisation			0
founded by @entity239 , who has been awarded a cbe for services to grassroots sport , parkruns are held across the @entity44 and in other parts of the world every saturday at 9am			0
the ethos is it 's a ' timed run ' not a race - so everyone is welcome regardless of their fitness or competitiveness			2
children can take part ( and in some areas there are 3k junior parkruns ) , as can parents with pushchairs and dogs with their owners			0
all the runs are free and require no pre-entry			0
all people have to do is sign up once on the parkrun website and print off a personal barcode to take along on any saturday they want to take part ( the barcode is how you get your time after the run )			0
for many people , their local parkrun has become part of their fitness routine or started them on a journey to become a marathoner or ultra marathoner			0
for others , it 's just a free , fun way to stay healthy - so it 's no wonder ten years later , 13 has become 850,000 from @entity278 to absolute beginners			0

quarter of @entity27 entrants are female
women not put off by masculine race title
ultra marathon races also increasing *popular* with fairer *sex*
yet not that long ago women were n't allowed to enter marathons
thought to be too dangerous for them to complete long distance
women 's @entity18 marathon was n't established till 1984
