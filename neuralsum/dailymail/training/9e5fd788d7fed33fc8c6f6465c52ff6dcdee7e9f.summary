@entity0 is a perfectly normal nine - year - old boy			1
his favourite band is one direction			1
and his favourite cartoon is @entity4 on the @entity5			1
but he has an exceptional talent			2
when he sits down at the enormous white grand piano in the sitting room of his parents ’ home , you realise @entity0 is a little bit different			1
for a brief moment , he is perfectly still , fingers hovering over the keys			2
then , suddenly , he ’s off like a rocket , launching into a @entity17 prelude and fugue in d minor			2
piano player @entity0 , nine , is releasing an album after becoming the youngest person in the world to pass a university - level piano diploma @entity0 ' @entity25 took nearly two years of study and involved two hours of daily practice			1
his mother @entity28 , pictured with him left , is also a pianist there ’s a look of intense concentration on his face			2
his fingers whizz up and down the keys as he switches into a @entity36 etude in e major			2
the entire piece of music – lasting around 10 minutes – is done from memory			2
there ’s not a sheet of music in sight			2
from the other side of the room , his mum @entity45 , 40 , looks on with pride			2
@entity0 - all 4ft 3in of him - is a musical prodigy , a mini @entity0 , a budding @entity0			1
he plays to concert halls and has just become the youngest person in the world to be given an associate of @entity54 ( @entity25 ) diploma			1
the diploma – which took nearly two years of study and involved two hours of daily practice – is the equivalent of passing the first - year of a university music @entity61 had to play for more than half an hour in a church hall in @entity63 , not far from their home in @entity0 began playing when he was just three @entity66 , @entity67 , in front of an examiner			1
the other two piano students sitting the exam that day were much older - 19 and 38			2
‘ i was nervous before i went in , ’ he giggles now			2
‘ but when i sit down at the piano , i feel calm and relaxed			2
i think : “ i ’m just going to sit here for a few seconds and start			2
” ’ he also had to write 700 words of ‘ programme notes ’ explaining his choice of pieces – the @entity17 he plays today , as well as a @entity0 sonata in d major and a @entity83 impromptu in g flat major			1
he says he did these himself at the computer in the upstairs study without help from his mum @entity45 or his dad , @entity89 , 45 , a graphic designer			1
this remarkable achievement is the culmination of six years of hard work			1
@entity0 started playing at the age of three after begging @entity45 , herself a professional concert pianist and piano teacher , for a go while she was playing			1
‘ i used to play him lullabies before bed , ’ she says			2
‘ because i was doing it , he wanted to			2
so i taught him his scales			2
’ the first song he learned in full was @entity104 – rapidly followed by the @entity106 theme and then @entity0 ’s @entity107			1
‘ i realised he was talented almost immediately			2
he picked things up very quickly , ’ says @entity45			0
at the age of four , @entity0 could read music by sight and took his @entity114 exam			1
‘ when we turned up at the exam centre , they thought it was me taking the exam , ’ laughs his mum			0
‘ he was so little that he had to helped up onto the piano stool			0
’ he passed and has since has whizzed through the grades			0
he passed the final one , @entity123 , last year , becoming the youngest pianist ever to do so			1
his first concert performance was three years ago , when a friend of his mum asked if he would play at a show to raise money for the homeless			1
he chose a piece by @entity131			0
@entity0 aged seven , when he had already passed his grade eight piano exam now he gives several performances a year - playing three times at the @entity36 museum in @entity138 and performing in front of an audience of more than 2,000 people at @entity143 ’s @entity142			1
‘ i was a teensy bit nervous , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ but it was exciting			0
’ in 2011 , piano manufacturers @entity146 invited him to the firm ’s hq in @entity151 headquarters and offered to sponsor @entity0 , loaning him keyboards for performances			1
not that it has all been plain sailing			0
two years ago , @entity0 was hugely disappointed when he entered @entity158 ’s @entity157 ’s @entity156 contest			1
after receiving a standing ovation from the judges at the audition stage , he was told to prepare to return for the televised announcement of the semi-finalists two months later			0
but two days before filming , he received a call saying that , in fact , he had n’t made it through			0
‘ we were all set to go – we had a hotel booked in central @entity67 and everything , ’ says @entity45			0
‘ @entity0 had his suitcase packed – we were very disappointed			1
’ ‘ i was looking forward to playing for the @entity171 , ’ adds @entity0 , wistfully			1
two years ago , @entity0 was hugely disappointed when he entered @entity158 's @entity173 s got talent contest he was heartbroken			1
perhaps , @entity175 ’s low - brow musical tastes do n’t stretch to @entity36 and @entity131			0
bouncing back from that setback , @entity0 had the challenge of juggling piano practice with his year five school work at the £ 16,000 - a - year @entity180 ’ @entity181 in @entity182			1
though an average week involves six hours of piano practice , his mum says school work is his priority			1
‘ we only ever practice piano if he ’s finished his homework , and though he receives a couple of invitations to perform each month , he can only do concerts on weekends or in the school holidays			1
’ even once his homework ’s done , piano is n’t the only after - school activity			0
@entity0 is a keen ice skater and footballer			1
he and his eight - year - old sister @entity198 – who plays the piano and the harp - take lessons at the local @entity201			0
@entity0 also plays defence for the school football team			1
despite his musical talent , his mother says homework always comes first and it all has to be fitted in before bed at 8pm			0
it ’s an awful lot for one little boy , but his mum insists she is no @entity211			0
‘ it ’s important he has other interests			0
i ’d never dream of sending him to a stage school			0
he ’s intelligent and needs a proper education and normal friends			0
’ she says that had he not been so eager to learn in the first place , she would n’t have forced him to take up piano			0
‘ i do n’t want to push him but he loves performing			0
he loves music – i ca n’t imagine him not wanting to do it			0
‘ does she ever worry about the effect of so much success so young ? there ’s no shortage of cautionary tales about child prodigies collapsing under the weight of expectation			0
‘ i think within classical music there are child prodigies – such as the @entity235 pianist @entity234 – who go on to do well , ’ says @entity45			0
‘ and @entity0 has balance			1
he has a normal school life and normal friends			0
’ what if he were to lose interest and pack it all in ? ‘ i would n’t mind if he really did n’t want to do it			0
but he ’s got a talent and to be able to play and make people happy is a rare thing			0
it makes him happy , so it would be a shame			0
’ listening to @entity0 reeling off his favourite composers - @entity17 and @entity83 and @entity36 and @entity0 ( ‘ because he ’s fast and fun ’ ) and pianists ( ‘ @entity234 and @entity254 ’ ) - it ’s hard to disagree			1
he ’s bubbly and confident and bursting with energy , bustling around showing me @entity258 videos of @entity254 playing @entity259 on @entity45 ’s @entity260 and talking excitedly about his football heroes , @entity262 and @entity263			0
i ca n’t imagine him being forced into anything			0
he ’s clearly mad about playing			0
happily , @entity0 says he ’s ‘ definitely not ’ tempted to quit piano – not even if he got the chance to join one direction			1
in november , he plans to release a cd and wants to take the next qualification – equivalent to a full three - year undergraduate degree			1
he also wants to learn how to compose and conduct			0
when he leaves school , he wants to go to university to study politics and maths			1
and then what – can he see himself becoming a professional pianist ? ‘ well , if my piano gets very good , i ’d like to be a piano player with an orchestra , ’ he says , thoughtfully			0
‘ but i ’d like to be prime minister as well - and maybe a doctor			0
a concert - giving , piano - playing , doctor prime minister ? @entity284 had better watch out .			0

he is youngest person to be given an @entity25 diploma
took nearly two years of study and involved two hours of daily practice
@entity0 is about to release his first album
