i was made a scapegoat ... and @entity2 wanted a team of @entity4 ' @entity5 ' prior was a schoolyard bully the day @entity7 told prior to ' f * * * off ' i did n't tell @entity9 how to get @entity10 out @entity11 has accused @entity2 of ‘ treating me like something stuck to the sole of his shoe ’ from the outset of his reign as @entity20 coach			1
the former @entity20 batsman is unsparing about his @entity23 adversary in his book @entity11 : the autobiography , which was released on monday			1
@entity11 , who had sought to have @entity2 sacked as assistant coach at the same time as @entity27 was first ousted , believes that the man who turned out to be @entity20 ’s most successful supremo was a control freak who was after him from the beginning			1
@entity11 ( left ) sits next to @entity2 , the man he called the ' @entity33 ' in 2012 the problems between them began when @entity2 was appointed as caretaker successor to @entity27 on the @entity20 tour to @entity38 in the early spring of 2009			1
while insisting that he conducted himself as the model professional , @entity11 accuses his coach of ‘ looking to pick a fight ’ by demanding that he showed a look of greater interest when other people were talking at team meetings			1
' with flower it was always about control , ' alleges the @entity9 born batsman			0
he accuses him of wanting to ‘ neutralise ’ him as the team ’s most talented player and ‘ keep me on the periphery until such time as he was ready to show me the door ’			0
@entity11 hits @entity2 , much respected by many others who played under him , with a stream of invective in the book , describing him as ‘ contagiously sour ’ and ‘ infectiously dour ’ , saying that he was the kind of man who could walk into a room and suck the life out of it			1
he calls him the ‘ @entity71 ’ and adds that the only time he felt really happy and appreciated in the @entity20 set up was under @entity67 and @entity68 , who masterminded the 2005 @entity70 triumph			1
flower makes a point to @entity11 last summer but the batsman said the former coach ' treated him like dirt ' @entity11 details how @entity2 banned the traditional touring fines meetings on that tour of the @entity79 , when over a beer players would bond and tease each other about their shortcomings , because it made some of the management team uncomfortable			1
he puts this down , again , to flower not feeling entirely in control of the situation			0
while admitting that he occasionally saw glimpses of a flower that he – and it should be said numerous others - found more appealing , he describes the coach as being ‘ f * * * ing horrendous ’ 95 per cent of the time			2
it must be emphasised that plenty who played under @entity2 would disagree with @entity11 ’s opinion of a man who won three @entity70 series as a coach and showed tremendous personal courage in his stand against @entity104 with @entity105 during the 2003 @entity106			1
the antagonistic nature of their relationship is a thread that runs through the whole book as the batsman places the blame for many of his woes as an @entity20 player at the door of the @entity118			2
@entity11 points the finger at @entity90 during a nets session at @entity121 in 2011 he does not rate him as a technical coach , and is very critical of the way he felt @entity2 allowed a group of bowlers to form themselves into a clique that alienated others , @entity11 more than anyone			1
the hurt that the batsman felt over the @entity133 account that continually teased him is something he believes that @entity2 should have stopped , and he connects the state of mind it put him in directly to the ‘ @entity138 ’ incident involving @entity10			0
he actually accuses flower of trying to prolong the whole @entity138 affair at one point , and describes the ‘ torture ’ that he thinks the management put him through as part of the reintegration process that led to him getting back in the team			0
another failing , he maintains , was allowing @entity7 ’s problems to get out of hand before he had to fly home from the disastrous @entity70 tour in @entity152			2
@entity11 believes that @entity2 was obsessed with his legacy being ruined by that dreadful winter , and was like ‘ a deer in the headlights ’ during the 5 - 0 drubbing			2
another crime of the coach was his closeness to @entity161 , who also bears the brunt of his most coruscating observations			0
@entity165 , @entity166 and , quite gratuitously , batsman @entity167 , are among others who do not escape the sharp end of his tongue			0
the neediness of @entity11 does show through in some of this analysis , like when he got upset that @entity2 did not want to join @entity173 in having a beer to celebrate the batsman ’s landmark of making 8,000 @entity177 runs			2
he even accuses him of smiling on one occasion when informing the player that he was being dropped			0
there was doubtless some blame on both sides , and @entity2 may want to give an equally comprehensive account of his version of events , which might differ considerably			0
it clearly goes way beyond the professional and is a very personal enmity			0
for all their talents , achievements and attributes as people and cricketers , it is clear that these two were never destined to get on , to put it mildly			0
@entity11 : the autobiography is published by @entity198 , priced £ 20 plus p&p .			2

@entity11 says @entity2 was ' always looking to pick a fight '
