by @entity1 reporter published : 02:17 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 31 may 2013 the @entity3 has had to ground an entire fleet of training aircraft following two incidents when propellers came off in mid-flight , meaning they have been unable to teach new pilots for almost five months			1
defence sources have described the grounding of the @entity13 aircraft , which are maintained by defence contractor @entity14 , as a ' complete fiasco '			1
the aircraft have not flown since january 9th following an incident at @entity18 in @entity19 when a plane 's propeller broke off in flight forcing an emergency landing			1
a @entity25 ' aircraft at @entity18			1
the @entity3 's entire fleet of the @entity28 - built planes has been grounded following two incidents when propellers broke off in mid air an almost identical incident which took place on august 23 , also near @entity18 , had been put down to lightning strike			1
and in 2004 , a propeller on one of the @entity36 broke up as it performed an aerobatic manouvere			2
both @entity39 @entity38 and @entity40 flew @entity36 at @entity18 as part of their training to become helicopter pilots			1
the aircraft , which have a top speed of around 200mph , were introduced into the @entity3 in 1999			2
prince @entity38 is seen next to an instructor in the cockpit of a @entity48 during his training to become a helicopter rescue pilot in 2008 the @entity3 website states : ' the tutor is a cost - effective , modern elementary training aircraft			2
the combination of docile handling characteristics and good performance make it very suitable for its training role			0
' a defence source told the @entity59 : ' there is now a bottleneck			0
no military pilot has started training for six months and there is no solution in sight			0
' according to the source a row has now broken out between the defence contractor @entity14 and the @entity28 manufacturers about who was responsible for the failures			1
safety fears : on both occasions the aircrafts ' propellers broke off in mid flight the source added : ' the aircraft are provided by @entity14 under a @entity80			1
the contract is to provide plying hours per year			2
' they are wriggling out of it saying it is a design fault , which is surprising considering the the supply of flying hours is the essence of the contract			0
' according to the @entity59 a second defence source suggested an attempt to fix the problem using a newly designed propeller had so far failed and that there were problems with the oil supply			0
an @entity96 spokesman said : ' the @entity96 can confirm that the @entity98 aircraft are currently undergoing a pause in flying operations whilst an on - going mechanical issue is investigated			2
' the impact to the training pipeline is being mitigated by the adoption of a number of measures including the use of other platforms			0
' whilst the @entity13 aircraft is not being utilised to deliver basic flying training at this time , flying training activity as a whole has not ceased			1
there has been no impact to the front line			0
' @entity14 are expected to comment later today			0
in 2009 , two teenage air cadets and two pilots were killed when two @entity118 collided in mid air above the @entity121 nature reserve			0
following the disaster the @entity3 has completed a Â £ 2.8m safety upgrade to all its basic training aircraft .			0

the @entity28 - built @entity13 aircraft have not flown since january 9th
it follows two incidents at @entity18 in january and in august last year
on both occasions propeller came off in flight forcing an emergency landing
@entity135 has broken out between manufacturer and *maintenance* contractor
