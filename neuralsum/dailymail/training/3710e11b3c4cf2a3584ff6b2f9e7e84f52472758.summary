city watchdogs will look at high - interest cards – dubbed ‘ payday loans with plastic ’ – and controversial no - interest deals that come with hefty penalties for those who miss a repayment			1
the @entity19 probe comes amid concerns that 18 per cent of @entity22 adults are vulnerable as they have too much debt			1
@entity19 chief executive @entity24 accused some lenders of pushing struggling households further into the red by dishing out credit cards			1
he said more than a million customers pay off only the minimum of their balance each month			0
many so - called ‘ survival borrowers ’ are juggling multiple cards and struggling to cope with their bills			1
mr @entity24 added that firms providing credit would have to examine ‘ fundamental questions of culture , ethics , business models and the like ’			0
the investigation , to be launched later this year , is the @entity19 ’s first major act since taking responsibility on tuesday for regulating around 50,000 ‘ consumer credit ’ firms , including payday lenders and debt management companies			1
but banks , building societies and other credit card providers will also fall under its scope			0
investigators will look into whether firms are selling suitable products to customers , whether the costs of credit are made clear at the outset , and how they deal with those who fall behind on repayments			0
one area likely to face scrutiny is the sale of hugely popular zero per cent balance transfer deals on credit cards			2
concerns : almost a fifth of @entity22 are vulnerable because of high levels of debt , according to figures ( file photo ) as a ploy to attract new customers , some banks offer interest - free periods of up to 31 months on their debts			1

mr @entity24 also warned that consumers are being given the equivalent of ‘ plastic pay day loans ’ – high - interest credit cards with low credit limits of a couple of hundred pounds			1
these tend to be offered for specialist lenders that cater for customers with poor credit records , such as @entity92			0
he said : ‘ why are card issuers providing the means , in some cases , for the most indebted consumers to escalate their way into further debt ? ’ consumer campaigners welcomed the probe			2

’ @entity19 chief executive @entity24 questioned why so many people in debt are offered more credit @entity107 , managing director of @entity108 , said : ‘ the customers who end up paying hundreds of pounds in interest and charges are those who can least afford it			2
’ the regulator has the power to fine firms up to 10 per cent of annual sales			0
it can also refer the matter to the @entity119 , which could break up companies			0
about 56million credit cards are issued to around 30million @entity22 customers , with £ 150billion spent on plastic last year			1
the total outstanding balance stands at £ 57billion			0
meanwhile , 8.4million households have no savings , warned the @entity19			0
