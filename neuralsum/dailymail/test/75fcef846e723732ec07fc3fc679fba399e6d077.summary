@entity0 may have to revert to a midfield role at @entity2 on saturday night after @entity3 and @entity4 were two of four @entity7 players ruled out of the clash with @entity9			1
centre - backs @entity11 and @entity13 will also miss the trip to the @entity16 leaders , and with @entity17 completing his six - match ban , @entity10 described it as ‘ the worst scenario ’			1
@entity11 and @entity4 , who was injured by @entity22 ’s controversial challenge in the @entity24 derby last weekend , both have ankle injuries while @entity3 limped out of that game with a tight calf and @entity13 later reported a stomach muscle problem			1
@entity3 limped off against @entity29 while @entity13 picked up an injury soon after @entity10 also revealed in his pre-match press conference that @entity4 and @entity11 are out @entity0 has impressed up front in recent weeks but may have to drop further back @entity10 puts his arm round @entity7 captain @entity0 during training this week @entity34 has revealed that @entity0 may play in holding midfield role against @entity9 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 : @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity0 ; @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ; @entity45 @entity7 ’s injury setback means that @entity40 and @entity45 could both be recalled against @entity48 ’s side			1
‘ i have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that ’s not so good for us , ’ said @entity34			1
‘ we had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it ’s not like that			1
@entity3 is out and @entity13 is out , but also blind and @entity11			1
‘ that ’s the worst scenario because @entity13 and @entity11 are good players at the left central defender position			1
@entity17 is suspended so we do n’t have many choices			2
@entity60 and @entity3 could play the midfield holding position and i do n’t have any other option , or i have to play @entity0 in that position again			1
i have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow			2
‘ other players can take profit of the momentum now			2
it ’s always like that			2
it ’s not special in the life of a manager or a team			2
‘ you have seen that i took @entity11 off pitch ( against @entity29 ) because of injury , you have seen that @entity3 was off the pitch , you have seen the tackle of @entity80 against @entity60			1
only @entity13 is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match			1
‘ it ’s because of the distance between the matches			2
@entity60 and @entity11 were very close to playing but it was not enough			1
‘ other players can take profit of the moment now			2
it ’s always like that			2
it ’s not special in the life of a manager or a team			2
’ @entity10 addresses the media ahead of @entity7 's crucial @entity16 clash with @entity9 @entity40 has n't featured under @entity10 recently but should return to play at left back @entity41 is closed down by his @entity7 team - mates during a training session on friday @entity43 will be hoping to continue his impressive form against @entity9 on saturday evening @entity100 is embraced by his team - mates after scoring against rivals @entity29 last week sports analysts @entity102 predict that a @entity9 win is easily the most likely outcome at @entity2 asked if @entity40 could return for the first time since being substituted in the @entity107 defeat to @entity108 last month amid concerns over his fitness , @entity34 replied : ‘ maybe you shall see tomorrow			1
@entity40 is fit enough i think			1
he has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and i do n’t like that			2
but we train and i think he is fit enough			2
’ with @entity9 holding an eight - point lead and a game in hand over third - placed @entity7 , @entity34 believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title			1
he also claimed that @entity48 will be happy with a draw			0
‘ it ’s still possible , i ’ve said that before , ’ he added			0
‘ it is not logical but it is possible			0
it ’s more when and if , and i do n’t believe in when and if			0
the fact is that we are behind @entity9			1
‘ but , alright , we have to play against them and so do @entity108 so we can lay pressure on @entity9 ’s shoulders			1
you never know , you ’ve seen it in previous @entity16 seasons			0
so i can not say it is not possible , but it is not logical			0
‘ they play at home but i think that @entity9 will be satisfied with a draw			1
of course they will want to beat @entity7 and we want to beat them , the question is how long players can play in the discipline			1
‘ we live for these titles , we are doing this for that			0
the only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title			0
when you are second or third you can play @entity150 , but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it			0
that ’s why managers are fixated on titles			0
when you reach that goal you are happy			0
‘ to be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal , that is also a goal of mine			0
that is why i ’m still a manager because i do n’t have to work anymore – you can count on that			0
i like to work with young people and help them in their career			0
’ @entity168 ( back right ) has only been training with @entity7 for a week but may return to feature @entity34 gave a young @entity48 his break in coaching at @entity172			1
asked to compare the @entity174 with his current assistant @entity175 , the @entity7 boss admitted that he has been surprised by the @entity178 legend ’s work ethic			1
he said : ‘ it ’s always difficult			0
people compare with each other because @entity48 was not the world - class player that @entity175 was			0
so that ’s the same thing with me			0
i was not as world - class as , for example , @entity186 yet our ambition is maybe then higher			0
‘ but i have to admit that i could not imagine when i spoke with him ( @entity175 ) in may or june to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it , that he works very hard			0
as an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker , and he reads the game very well like @entity48			0
but to manage a group you have to work , and what i can see is that he ’s learning quickly			0
’ @entity38 celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at @entity178			0

@entity7 have won six games in a row ahead of @entity9 clash
but @entity10 will travel to @entity2 without several key men
@entity11 , @entity13 , @entity3 and @entity4 are all *sidelined*
@entity40 should start at left back on return to @entity7 side
@entity0 may have to revert back to holding midfield role
@entity10 describes injuries as ' the worst possible scenario '
