by @entity0 published : 09:39 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 12:49 est , 14 march 2012 many people are subjected to their neighbours ' noisy attempts at @entity4			2
however , most of us might only have to endure it on the weekends or on @entity8			0
so spare a thought for the residents in this @entity12 road whose lives were made a misery for ten years while their noisy neighbour built a microlight plane and a boat - in his one - bedroom flat			1
mad mechanic @entity19 - who shares his name with the prime minister - transformed the block of flats he lived at in exclusive @entity24 into his own personal workshop for a decade			1
scroll down to see what mr @entity19 's neighbours experienced ! ... his own personal workshop : huge chunks of @entity19 's contraptions were built in his flat then taken outside and assembled the end of their tether : @entity35 said they had enough of him operating heavy machinery , tinkering with engines and sawing and hacking at wood on the doorstep of their apartment block first he built his own full - sized microlight - fitted with a cockpit and propellers - at the property and then spent two years constructing his own 12ft by 10ft speed boat			1
now the housing association tenant is to be evicted from his home			2
huge chunks of @entity19 ’s contraptions were built in his flat then taken outside and assembled			1
however both were dismantled when neighbours complained to housing association chiefs - about the incessant banging , crashing , sawing and angle - grinding which has gone on for a decade			1
@entity35 said they had reached the end of their tether with him operating heavy machinery , tinkering with engines and sawing and hacking at wood on the doorstep of their apartment block			0
on one occasion @entity19 was caught single - handedly lowering a 12ft metal girder from his bedroom window on a piece of old rope			1
on another occasion he was filmed with sparks flying on to the street as he recklessly operated an angle grinder on his front garden wall			0
housing bosses confirmed they had lost patience with @entity19 and were giving him the boot			1
mad mechanic : he first built his own full - sized microlight fitted with a cockpit and propellers at the property and then spent two years constructing his own 12ft by 10ft speed boat quite the handyman : at one point @entity19 built a microlight aircraft in his one bedroom flat constant and incessant noise ... but @entity19 's contraptions were dismantled when neighbours complained to housing association chiefs the pensioner is being evicted after he was finally ruled to have breached his tenancy agreement and ignored an injunction he was served with last year			1
@entity95 , 55 , a father of two , who lives below @entity19 said his life had been made a ' living hell '			1
the former computer engineer said : ' there is constant crashing , sawing and chopping , which goes on for hours			0
' it started when i moved in and he built a plane			0
he then spent years repairing bike engines in his little one bedroom flat			0
' then about two years ago he started building a boat			0
i have asked him to stop dozens of times but he just threatens me			0
' he caused flooding on christmas morning and even lowered a massive steel girder from his bedroom window entirely on his own			0
' it 's amazing he can do all this in his flat but he has caused havoc for the rest of us			2
causing havoc : @entity19 's work left neighbours so distressed that housing officers are now in the process of evicting him on one occasion @entity19 was caught single - handedly lowering a 12ft metal girder from his bedroom window on a piece of old rope ' i have been trying to get him stop and he has been taken to court but he just does n’t listen			1
all i have ever wanted is peace and he has not allowed me to have that			0
' in september last year @entity129 sought a court injunction preventing @entity19 from undertaking large building work in his second floor flat , which is in a converted town house with three other apartments			1
but at the start on february 10 housing officers were forced to visit @entity19 after receiving more complaints from distressed neighbours			1
he failed to comply with a final warning and a notice to possess his property was sent last week			0
a spokesman for housing association @entity129 , said : ' following repeated complaints about mr @entity19 we sought a court injunction to prevent further work from taking place			2
' as the resident has consistently ignored the previous warnings and the injunction , @entity129 has been left with no other alternative but to seek possession of the property			0
' in terms of how mr @entity19 was building the plane and boat , he was constructing various bits in his flat			2
he claimed that the full thing was then being constructed away from his flat			0
' video : @entity19 worked on the microlight plane and boat for ten years			2

mechanic - called @entity19 - drove his neighbours crazy with noise
he is being kicked out of his home in @entity12 's @entity168
