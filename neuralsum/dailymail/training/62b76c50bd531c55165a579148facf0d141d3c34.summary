this amazing image was created by designer @entity6 , and shows data of every recorded event since 1851			1
it also offers a unique perspective of the earth from the bottom up - with @entity13 in the middle , the @entity15 on the right and @entity17 on the left an astonishing new map reveals all of the world 's hurricanes and intense weather events since 1951 in a single image			1
@entity24 , the user experience and mapping manager for @entity27 , a data visualization company , claims the unique view was the best way to tell the story of the data			1
' when i put it onto a rectangular map it was neat looking , but a little bit disappointing , ' @entity6 told @entity38			0
but the unorthodox , bottom - up perspective allowed the curving paths the storms make across the world 's oceans to shine , he said			1
@entity6 used @entity45 government data on tropical storms and hurricanes from 1851 through 2010			0
the hurricane map is the latest in a series of maps @entity6 has made that showcase the planet 's natural phenomena in arresting ways			0
a map of the world 's earthquakes since 1898 and a map of the rise in @entity45 wildfires since 2001 also offer unique , wide - scale looks at natural disasters			2
the designers tried several different ways of displaying the data before deciding on the final version			0
he also revealed some of the behind the map , including a timeline version that shows storms over time			2
it shows the number of storms leapt up in the latter half of the 20th century , because of technological advances			2
' when first registering the data , i accidentally assigned time as one of the location coordinates and , after the initial disappointment of what i though was mucked up data , realized that what i was actually seeing was a timeline visualization of where we 've historically paid mind to collecting storm data , ' he said			0
' check out this bit of happenstance that showed me we only really started logging the @entity93 and @entity95 hemisphere versions of these things around 1978			0
' in addition , the dearth of storms in the @entity100 and @entity99 is also a product of a lack of data			0
the @entity45 began to add storms from these regions to the archive beginning only in 1978			2
this test image reveals a timeline visualization of where storm data is collected around the world .			1
