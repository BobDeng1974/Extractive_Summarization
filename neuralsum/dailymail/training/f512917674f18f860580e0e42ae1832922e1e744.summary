by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity2 has backed plans for a @entity5 gypsy camp in one of @entity1 's most exclusive neighbourhoods saying there is no reason it would n't work the prime minister of @entity12 has infuriated cabinet colleagues by backing plans to set up a @entity5 gypsy camp in one of the most affluent districts of @entity1			1
@entity2 , one of the most traditional @entity17 in his government , said he could see no reason why the plan for the 16th arrondissement should not be a success			1
‘ why not ? ’ he said , when told about the project put forward by elected officials from the @entity25			0
it would see thousands of mainly @entity28 gypsies setting up their caravans and huts around a chic area renowned for its upmarket shops and restaurants			1
this is despite efforts by successive @entity12 governments to smash the camps to pieces and to deport the gypsies who live in them			0
such issues will be of particular interest to @entity43 , which is preparing to welcome thousands of @entity28 and @entity45 immigrants next year when @entity47 labour laws revised			0
last month mr @entity2 ’s colleague @entity48 , the interior minister , said it was ‘ an illusion to think that we can solve the @entity5 problem through integration			1
’ mr @entity48 wants to do everything possible to keep the @entity5 out of @entity12 , as he associates them with crime and public health problems			2
his views were supported by a @entity59 poll which revealed that 77 per cent of @entity12 people agreed that @entity5 were inherently ‘ different ’			2
but the more liberal mr @entity2 said the gypsies could be integrated into @entity12 life , adding : ‘ solutions can be found , as long as the people in question respect the @entity67 ’s laws			2
’ the @entity5 have long been victimised across @entity68 for their associations with poverty and crime this is the town of @entity73 , a fomer attempt to integrate the @entity5 in @entity45 that ended up by being demolished by the gypsies it once sheltered the 16th arrondissement is the @entity1 equivalent of @entity79 in @entity80 – full of extremely rich residents and expensive properties			1
@entity83 , of the @entity84 , said : ‘ ten thousand of the seventeen thousand @entity5 immigrants who live in @entity12 live in @entity1 in conditions of extreme poverty			0
’ many are in shanty towns on the edge of the capital , from where they take public transport into the city to beg and steal			0
the news will alarm some in the @entity43 who fear an influx of the travellers after boarder controls with @entity28 are relaxed next year in @entity12 the irony has long been acknowledged that wealthy liberals want to integrate foreigners , but not near their own homes mr @entity83 said putting them in the large , prosperous 16th would make them feel more integrated , especially as there was plenty of space for a new camp			0
@entity111 , the conservative mayor of the 16th arrondissement , said the proposed plan was an ‘ outlandish ’ one , and should be opposed at all costs			1
many have pointed to the hypocrisy of rich @entity1 liberals who call for more efforts to be made integrating immigrants , while refusing to have them anywhere near their own homes .			0

proposed camp would be in 16th arrondissement
area is known for its upmarket shops and restaurants
@entity2 said he can see no reason camp would n't work
@entity48 last month called for all @entity5 to return to home country
