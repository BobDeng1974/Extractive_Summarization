scientists have mapped out the best ways for men suffering back pain to have sex			1
contrary to popular belief ' spooning ' is not always the best position for those who suffer back ache , researchers found			1
instead having sex ' doggy - style ' may work better for many couples , they said			1
scientists at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , documented precisely how the spine moves during sex			1
they then created a set of guidelines that recommended different positions and ' thrusting techniques ' based on what triggered a man 's back pain			0
the findings , published in the journal @entity36 , included a recommendation for men who were flexion - intolerant - meaning those whose back pain was made worse by touching their toes or sitting for long periods of time - who should replace spooning with doggy - style sex			1
they should also try a ' hip - hinging motion rather than thrusting with their spines ' , the authors said			0
researchers said back pain could leave some couples to be celibate lead author @entity51 said : ' before now , spooning was often recommended by physicians as the one position that fit all			1
' but as we 've discovered , that is not the case			0
' sex positions that are suitable for one type of back pain are n't appropriate for another kind of pain			2
' for the first time ever , we now have very solid science to guide clinicians on their recommendations for patients who suffer debilitating back pain , but still want to be intimate			0
' this has the potential to improve quality of life - and love - life - for many couples			0
' professor @entity74 , of the @entity11 's faculty of applied health sciences , added : ' any family doctor will tell you that couples often ask them how to manage their back pain during and after sex			2
' many couples will remain celibate because one night of love - making can lead to months of back agony			2
' until now , doctors have never had any hard science to base their recommendations upon			0
' the researchers plan to publish details about what happens to the female spine in coming months .			0
