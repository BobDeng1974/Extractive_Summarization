‘ i ’d always ask people to repeat themselves			1
i felt like a stuck record , ' said @entity3 @entity3 had struggled with her hearing for 15 years before she realised she had a genuine problem			1
‘ everything sounded muddy , as if through a door — but i assumed it was hay fever blocking my ears , ’ says the 44 - year - old administrator from @entity7			1
however , over the years it gradually got worse			0
@entity3 had to turn up the tv volume louder and louder , and could understand people only if she could see their mouths			1
‘ i ’d always ask people to repeat themselves			1
i felt like a stuck record , ’ she says			0
but it was only when , in 2012 , she saw an advert about hearing tests that she decided to take action			1
she had lost 60 per cent of her hearing and needed two hearing aids			1
the difference they made , is , she says , ‘ amazing ’			0
‘ as i walked into our kitchen i asked what the ticking noise was — it was a huge clock that i ’d never realised made a sound , ’ says @entity3 , who is married to @entity26 , 52 , the director of a building company , and has two daughters , aged 23 and 20			1
‘ i ’d stopped working in a big office — now i have the confidence to do it again			0
' and i use the train — previously , talking through a ticket office window was a no - no. ’ more than ten million @entity38 — one in six — are thought to have some hearing loss , yet many wait years before seeking help			1
there are two main types			0
conductive hearing loss occurs when sounds can not pass from the outer ear to the inner ear			1
causes include a blockage , fluid build - up , or a problem with the small bones inside the ear that help you hear			0
@entity3 has conductive loss , diagnosed by a specialist after she ’d had a standard test at a branch of @entity59 , a hearing aid chain			1
@entity61 is caused by otosclerosis — an abnormal , often genetic , growth of bone in the middle ear , affecting 1 to 2 per cent of people			1
the second type is sensorineural hearing loss caused by damage to tiny hair cells inside the cochlea , the spiral - shaped structure in the inner ear , or to the auditory nerve			1
hearing relies on sound waves entering the ear and causing the eardrum to vibrate			2
@entity3 needed two hearing aids			1
the difference they made , is , she says , ‘ amazing ’ the vibrations are passed to the inner ear , where the hair cells move in response and send a signal through the auditory nerve to the brain			0
these hair cells can be damaged by injury or noise exposure , but it also happens naturally with age			0
more than half of people over 60 have some hearing loss , and campaigners are pushing for everyone over 65 to have their hearing screened on the @entity100			1
but some experts say we should be having hearing tests even earlier			2
@entity104 , professor of auditory neuroscience and director of the @entity107 , says : ‘ we start losing our hearing as babies , but do n’t notice it			2
' but by their mid- 40s most people will have some hearing loss that affects their day - to - day life			1
’ generally , we lose our ability to hear higher frequencies first			0
this can make deciphering speech difficult because consonants that help make words distinct are in the high frequencies , around 3 - @entity121			0
standard hearing tests , or audiograms — which measure your hearing by playing sounds at different volumes and pitches and ask you to respond by pressing a button — test up to @entity131			2
professor @entity104 would advise anyone over 45 to get their hearing checked — for example , at a @entity138 optician that offers a free hearing test — even if they do n’t think they have a problem , as people do n’t always realise what they should be able to hear			1
this is because not seeking help when you need it can make things worse : hearing loss can not only cause social isolation and depression , but there are concerns that it could lead to cognitive problems			1
in 2011 , @entity159 researchers found older people with hearing loss are more likely to develop dementia , perhaps because a common brain pathway underlies both conditions			1
another theory is the strain of trying to decode sounds can overwhelm the brain , leaving people more vulnerable to dementia			1
research is continuing about whether hearing aids can reduce the risk			2
studies suggest that for every 25 decibels of hearing loss ( decibels relate to volume of sound — normal speech is around 60 ) a person experiences , they age cognitively by seven years — so a 59 - year - old who has lost 25 decibels will perform like a 66 - year - old in mental tasks			1
professor @entity104 says : ‘ not hearing properly can add to what ’s known as your cognitive load			2
‘ i ’d stopped working in a big office — now i have the confidence to do it again			0
and i use the train — previously , talking through a ticket office window was a no - no , ' said @entity3 ' the more cost you put to your brain while straining to hear someone speak , the fewer resources you have to do something else at the same time			1
’ and parts of the brain involved with hearing can start to shut down without enough input — so your hearing may get worse if you delay treatment			2
‘ it can take three months for your brain to tune in to a hearing aid , especially if you ’ve had the problem for a long time			2
’ he also warns that even top - ofthe - range versions have limitations			0
‘ hearing aids will help , rather than cor rect , your hear ing , ’ he says			2
‘ so you should be given proper expectations of what they can do — they amplify sounds but wo n’t necessarily discriminate between them			0
’ but there ’s another complicating factor to be aware of			0
according to professor @entity104 , younger people ’s hearing loss may occur for a different reason from older people ’s — and it ’s one that ’s hard for specialists to detect			1
‘ we ’ve identified a problem called “ hidden hearing loss ” — so called because it ’s not picked up by traditional hearing tests , ’ he says			1
more than ten million @entity38 — one in six — are thought to have some hearing loss while extremely loud noises — such as a chainsaw — can permanently kill off hair cells , it is thought that in hidden hearing loss , the damage affects the nerve cells in the cochlea			1
rather than dying off , they lose their connections with the hair cells , so can not send information to the brain			0
it ’s possible the culprit need only be moderate noise , such as that of a busy street , although more research is needed into how much exposure would cause this			0
one type of nerve cell particularly affected is the kind that only responds to sounds above a certain volume			0
this means as this nerve cell is damaged , so is our ability to distinguish particular sounds against loud noises			0
professor @entity104 adds : ‘ an audiogram only measures your ability to hear distinct tones against a backdrop of silence			0
' so you may get a clean bill of health but still have hearing deficit			2
’ there are currently no accurate ways to diagnose this problem , and researchers are looking at whether hearing aids can even help			2
@entity281 , head of biomedical research at the charity action on @entity284 , says : ‘ we know there are lots of people with good hearing who struggle to follow conversation in background noise , but it ’s not yet clear if they all have hidden hearing loss or something else , such as problems with cognitive processing			1
’ what does seem clear is that many people with hearing loss delay seeking help — by an average of ten years , reckons the charity @entity304			1
reasons include not realising they have a problem to the social stigma surrounding hearing aids			2
it ’s a stigma that @entity310 , 30 , has grappled with			0
the health and fitness journalist , from @entity313 , shrugged off her poor hearing at first — but it became harder to ignore when it started affecting her work			2
‘ in my 20s i started tv presenting , but could n’t cope with the producers talking into my earpiece			0
' i stopped doing that type of presenting because i relied on lip - reading a lot			0
’ @entity310 admits the only hearing test she ’s had as an adult was when she was 24 , at a @entity138 optician ’s offering hearing tests			0
‘ they confirmed my hearing was well below what it should be and that i ’d need a hearing aid			0
but i never went back			0
’ she adds : ‘ when i meet someone new i joke about being deaf			0
' it ’s deteriorated recently and i ’m worried that when i ’m 40 i wo n’t be able to hear at all			0
