for a man who does n't smoke , @entity0 has developed an unfortunate habit of falling onto cigarettes and pipes			1
three times now he has either been pictured fag in mouth or shisha pipe in hand			1
that ’s a decent number for a player who , after ( unlucky ) strike one in 2013 , said : ‘ i made a mistake			2
i 'm not a smoker			2
’ around the time he also tweeted a picture of @entity18 having a cigarette			2
on that logic , he could have also referenced @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 or @entity25			2
@entity0 with friends , holding a shisha pipe in a @entity28 @entity0 was first spotted smoking outside @entity30 in @entity31 in october 2013 @entity0 was again pictured with a cigarette in his mouth , this time after the @entity34 while on a stag - weekend in @entity35 in july 2014 @entity0 has once again made the headlines for the wrong reasons			1
when is he going to realise his place in the @entity40 team is under serious threat and start acting like a professional ? @entity43 , @entity44 surely it ’s time to start educating @entity0 and have somebody explain to him how to behave			1
if he was smoking that pipe , even if it does n’t do him any serious damage as a player i would n’t put myself in that position			1
the goalkeeper has already lost his place over a smoking issue so you would never dream of being seen with anything – cigarette , shisha , lager , anything			1
being in the team means so much to you and is such a reward for your efforts that it ’s not worth that risk			2
he is obviously going out and thinks he is in a private situation but you never are as a footballer , there is always somebody on the lookout			2
you have to be squeaky clean and if you are serious about your football that ’s how you should want to live anyway			2
@entity76 good company and good puffers , but he might start to feel left out when the smoke clears and he sees how many medals they have each won			2
with @entity0 , that might always be the cliched punchline			1
at 23 , his solitary @entity88 winner ’s medal does n't seem quite enough			2
in a team game it would be wrong to draw too much from that statistic			2
but what , then , to make of his talent when set against the staggering potential ? has one of @entity96 ’s great young prospects become one of @entity96 ’s great players ? how much serious interest is there among title - contending clubs around @entity103 to sign him ? it ’s been almost a year since @entity106 said : ' @entity0 , he came on the scene and what a top player he looked , but he ’s never really gone on			1
he needs people like [ @entity112 ] @entity111 to take him to the next level			0
his development , he does n’t look any better now than he did at 17			0
’ @entity0 has not played since novemeber after picking up an injury against @entity116 @entity0 posed a picture of himself in hospital after ankle surgery at the end of 2014 @entity0 stepped up his return from injury and was pictured at @entity40 's training ground with @entity124 @entity0 made contact with @entity106 after that and , after a bit of good form for club and country , @entity106 backtracked			1
in october , the former @entity116 midfielder said ‘ the penny has dropped ’ for @entity0			1
and yet it has n't			0
certainly not when it comes to smoking			1
and as a player has he really turned a corner ? there will always be spectacular moments that make you think so			0
his performance in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity144 in september was simply sublime			0
but his talent has never been in doubt			0
everyone knows he has brilliant physical gifts and a mind that knows how to work them			0
he is a unique talent			0
the ambiguity comes over his ability to sustain any kind of form and with that comes his never - ending challenge of staying injury free			1
the rent - a - quotes have had a good run in explaining that smoking will hardly accelerate a return from injury			1
that much is obvious , regardless of how many successful sportsmen have an occasional cigarette , and regardless of how little damage a sporadic cigarette might do			0
but the point remains , smoking is something smokers of all levels of dedication try to get away with			1
it is not something that will enhance anyone physically			0
if there is an affect from smoking , the scientists and doctors of this world are really rather confident about which way it goes			1
@entity0 celebrates scoring against @entity144 at the @entity184 earlier this season @entity0 has won 26 caps for @entity96 - but could have won far more had he not suffered so many injuries for @entity0 , once more an injured athlete , surely now is the time to maximise his chances of good health			1
surely the onus should be on returning quickly from his latest ankle problem , this one having kept him out since november 22			1
surely , the desire to make up for lost time in a stop - start career must be overwhelming by now			0
those are the assumptions , anyway			0
his frustrations and disappointments at his injuries – 84 appearances in four seasons since his breakthrough in 2010 - 11 is simply not enough – must be incomprehensible to anyone beyond the man himself			0
but aside from pontifications such as this and the many others that accompany this sort of subject , his employers have already been clear on the subject			0
@entity21 and @entity24 are two players who have smoked in their career this was @entity217 in response to the 2013 incident : ‘ i disagree completely with that behaviour			1
i do n't know really what happened , so i will need to have a chat with him about that			0
’ this was @entity217 in 2014 , after @entity0 ’s @entity227 cigar : ‘ i have n’t spoken to him so it ’s very difficult for me to make any statement			1
i know what you can make of the pictures			0
‘ i have to speak to him before i come out publicly			0
we will speak this week			0
i am not deeply concerned by it but i just want to know what happened			0
’ goalkeeper @entity236 was caught smoking on @entity237 - and is now out of the team quite aside from the thought that @entity217 ’s hairdryer is not enough to extinguish a cigarette – @entity236 felt comfortable enough lighting up in the shower on @entity237 , even though he has since been left on the sidelines – @entity0 is plainly ignoring advice from his manager			1
he will doubtless offer contrite words			0
but it should n’t be about whether he is sorry or not			0
it should be about a realisation that his career is ticking away and it might not be a tremendously good idea to stand in front of a camera with a pipe .			2
