support : @entity1 , who is urging the government to stop punishing middle class families with the 40p rate the 40p tax rate is killing ambition and the chancellor must act to stop punishing middle - class families who are not well - off , a leading @entity9 warned last night			1
@entity1 , secretary of the influential @entity10 , said the government risked ‘ undermining aspiration ’ by allowing millions of middle - income earners to be dragged into the 40p tax bracket , which was once reserved for the wealthy			1
the government has raised the threshold at which people pay basic - rate income tax to £ 10,000			2
but @entity9 @entity19 are now lobbying chancellor @entity20 hard ahead of next week ’s budget because workers are now hit with the 40p rate as soon as they earn £ 41,450 a year			1
when @entity9 chancellor @entity24 cut the top rate of tax to 40p in 1988 , just one in 20 taxpayers – some 1.35million – was affected			2
by 2010 , when @entity30 entered @entity31 , there were three million workers paying 40 per cent tax , while today there are 4.4million			0
speaking to the @entity35 , mr @entity1 warned the number would soar even higher , adding : ‘ paying 40p to the government of every pound earned over the present threshold of £ 41,450 is at best demoralising			1
‘ at worst , it can kill ambition and undermine aspiration			0
‘ the number of workers paying the higher 40p tax rate is expected to rise from 4.4million this year to more than 6million in 2015 because the threshold rate will not increase in line with inflation			1
’ calling for a rise in the threshold , he said : ‘ this tax rate , when conceived years ago , was for the relatively well - off			1
yet my constituents who earn that sum of £ 41,450 are far from “ well - off ”			1
‘ mortgage or rent , season ticket , council tax , household bills , car , insurance – the list goes on , leave little for luxuries one would normally associate with the well - off			0
’ he pointed out that the net income after tax and @entity65 of someone on £ 41,450 is just £ 30,000 – just £ 4,000 above the household welfare cap of £ 26,000 a year , adding : ‘ is that not a stark indication of how imbalanced the present threshold is ? ’ ‘ for these middle - income earners who are instinctively striving to improve their lot and yet bearing a considerable price for the failed debt - ridden policies of the last @entity77 government , what better means to show our support than to make it clear we want to increase the threshold where employees pay 40 per cent tax ? ’ @entity24 ( right ) cut the top rate of tax to 40p in 1988 and just some 1.35million were affected			1
when @entity30 took power , there were three million workers paying 40 per cent tax , while today there are 4.4million he spoke out as @entity9 activists went even further , demanding the abolition of the 40p tax rate			1
@entity94 , of the grassroots renewal group , which wants the @entity9 to do more to appeal to northern and working - class voters , said the 45p rate – which applies to those earning at least £ 150,000 – should kick in on earnings above £ 62,000			1
the plan would mean two million middle - class workers would get a tax cut of up to £ 2,000 a year			1
but mr @entity1 said he would not back the plan because it would simply move the problem slightly higher up the income scale			0
even @entity106 , the mp for @entity107 and a lynchpin of @entity109 , says he would rather see further cuts for those on low incomes			0
next week ’s @entity113 is expected to increase the basic - rate income - tax threshold to at least £ 10,500 , at a cost of around £ 1billion , raising the prospect of the 40 per cent threshold being lowered again to limit the benefit to higher earners			2
but mps say the time has come for mr @entity20 to do something for the ‘ squeezed middle ’ earning between £ 40,000 and £ 60,000			0
mr @entity94 said : ‘ more and more people on middle incomes have been dragged into paying the 40 per cent rate of tax over the past decade or so			2
that includes teachers , nurses , bricklayers , police officers and tube drivers			0
these are not the type of people who should be paying higher - rate tax			2
’ treasury officials decline to comment on @entity113 deliberations			0
by @entity106 mp for @entity139 and @entity140 of @entity142 debate about tax rates in this @entity144 has tended to concentrate on the two extreme ends of the spectrum			0
@entity77 has made constant reference to those benefiting in the reduction of the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p ( despite the fact that just 6.3 % of those paying the 50p tax rate would be people earning £ 1 million or more according to @entity157 ’s @entity156 )			1
at the other end of the scale , conservatives have been right to highlight the success of raising threshold at which people being paying income tax from £ 6,475 in 2010 to £ 10,000			0
@entity166 is simply squabbling when he worries more about who gets the credit for it than who benefits from it			0
indeed , all conservative mps are rightly proud that it has been a @entity174 - led government that has cut taxes for 24 million people , including lifting 2.7 million out of paying tax altogether			0
@entity1 says the number of middle income earners who are being captured in the so called ' higher ' earnings tax rate of 40p has increased this is no mean achievement during a time of austerity , when balancing the books has been the single most important task for the government			1
that task had been made all the more difficult by the top rate of tax being raised to 50p in the last days of the previous @entity77 government ; study after study has shown that this move actually cost money , perhaps as much as £ 4 billion a year			2
full marks go to @entity20 for ignoring the shrill voices of the left and reducing this rate back to 45p			0
it will collect more tax in total and sends a clear message to both @entity204 and overseas investors			0
but whilst these debates have raged there is a slow but substantial increase in the number of middle income earners who , whilst having benefited from the new threshold of £ 10,000 , are being captured in the so called " higher " earnings tax rate of 40p			1
the mp says the tax rate , when conceived years ago , was for the relatively well - off			1
but many of his constituents who earn £ 41,450 are far from ' well off ' , he insists this higher rate kicks in at earnings over £ 41,450 a year			1
to be precise the number of workers paying the higher 40p tax rate is expected to rise from 4.4 million this year to more than 6 million in 2015 because the threshold rate will not increase in line with inflation anymore therefore dragging more people into this tax band			1
this tax rate , when conceived years ago , was for the relatively well - off			1
yet my constituents who earn that sum of £ 41,450 are far from ' well off '			2
mortgage or rent , season ticket , council tax , household bills , car , insurance ( the list goes on ) leave little for luxuries one would normally have associated with the well - off			0
indeed , the net income after tax and @entity65 of someone on £ 41,450 is £ 30,000 : just £ 4,000 above the household welfare cap of £ 26,000 a year			2
is that not a stark indication of how imbalanced the present threshold is ? for these middle income earners who are instinctively striving to improve their lot and yet bearing a considerable price for the failed debt - ridden policies of the last @entity77 government , what better means to show our support than to make it clear we want to increase the threshold where employees pay 40 % tax ? i do n't suggest that the chancellor can do this now or even before 2017 , but he can make it clear that this is the direction of travel for the conservative party			0
he can take comfort from the fact that presently the top 1 % pay a record 29.8 % of all income tax , and the top 16 % of earners pay 67 %			0
that is more than enough justification to introduce a modest change to the threshold			0
let ’s face it : paying 40 pence to the government of every pound earned over the present threshold of £ 41,450 is at best demoralising			2
at worst , it can kill ambition and undermine aspiration .			0

@entity1 says 40p tax rate ran risk of ' undermining aspiration '
said middle - class , not well - off families , were being punished by tax
workers hit with 40p rate as soon as they earn £ 41,450
