by @entity0 published : 19:02 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 10:35 est , 14 may 2013 @entity0 is proud to be a @entity1 our ruling classes have a new term of abuse - nimby			1
the not in my backyard brigade - anyone brave enough to stand up and shout they do n't want a pylon , a smelly pig farm , a waste disposal unit , a travellers ' encampment or a high - speed rail link in their neighbourhood			0
nimbys are not small - minded petty bigots but normal voters and taxpayers			0
they wave home - made placards , march on town halls to fight ugly estates springing up around their small towns , organise sit - ins to keep cottage hospitals and maternity wards open and who do n't want gorgeous views blighted by windfarms			0
far from being celebrated for protecting everything we value about @entity34 , @entity1 are trashed by politicians as selfish irritants , objects of derision			1
last week , planning minister @entity39 - a man determined to concrete over as much of our green and pleasant land as possible in the name of ' progress ' - finally admitted he would never be able to defeat @entity1			1
this in spite of pushing through radical changes to the planning laws which could see disused barns being turned into cafes and shops , and huge new housing schemes going ahead on farmland no matter what residents say			0
@entity39 had the cheek to say @entity1 should ' channel ' their anger , stop objecting and ' get involved ' with developers to ' create an environment '			1
that 's like asking us to shake hands with the devil			2
we need new homes , but not at the expense of our precious countryside			0
developers are sitting on huge banks of land they have been stockpiling for decades , and there are enough brownfield sites to fill most of our housing needs			0
there is no need for councils to greenlight new projects permitted by mr @entity39 's new laws until developers build on sites they already own			2
i 'm proud to be a @entity1			1
i signed a petition against a huge electrical sub-station for an offshore windfarm being built on the edge of @entity85 in @entity86 - but @entity87 ( who claims he cares about the environment ) , planning minister at the time , gave it the go - ahead , and now ugly concrete bunkers desecrate this lovely spot			1
@entity0 has signed petitions to stop wind farms being built since she feels they ruin the landscape on - shore windfarms are not cost - efficient and when the technology has been superseded , who is going to go around the @entity34 digging up the ugly concrete pads these things sit on and put the soil back ? windfarms are to be built on @entity105 farmland near @entity106 in @entity107 , destroying a view that inspired painters for centuries			1
in @entity112 , the @entity105 granted rights to @entity112 and @entity114 for an offshore windfarm which would have desecrated beautiful @entity116 - thanks to @entity1 , those plans were eventually abandoned			1
another @entity1 victory saw @entity118 rethink ludicrous plans to allow neighbours to build giant extensions ( up to 26ft long ) without planning permission - twice the current limit			1
the proposed @entity125 high - speed rail link between @entity126 and @entity127 was foisted on us as if it 's going to save the @entity34 economy singlehanded , when we already have a rail network that does n't work properly and needs upgrading			2
@entity1 recently won an important victory with a high court ruling that plans for compensation were unfair so the government must go through the consultation process all over again			1
attacking the brave @entity1 , @entity137 accused homeowners of ' putting family interests ahead of national interests '			2
could this be the same bunch of politicians who complain if any new roads and factory farming units might be sited near their second homes in the country ? why should n't homeowners demand the full value of their home and damages if forced to leave their neighbours and decamp somewhere fresh so a train can whizz through the beautiful @entity153 and @entity154 , delivering businessmen to @entity156 a little bit quicker ? by the time the railway is built , business will be conducted via the internet and this ' need ' for intercity commuting will have evaporated ! last week , a @entity162 decided that instead of building a new airport in the @entity165 , @entity163 should be allowed two more runways further to the @entity167			2
these mps assumed that we need more airport capacity in the @entity127 area , when there is plenty of evidence we have enough airports all over the country to take more flights			0
expect @entity1 living west of @entity127 to start marshalling their opposition - and that will include all the @entity168 whose constituencies these extra ' essential ' flights will be polluting with fumes and noise from early morning to late at night			2
some planning reforms are long - overdue - allowing offices , hotels and leisure facilities to be turned into housing and schools , for example			0
anything which breathes life back into our @entity194 is to be welcomed			0
but asking @entity1 to stop protesting and cosy up to developers - whose agenda is pure profit - is nothing more than wishful thinking			1
i will go to my grave a @entity1 - and i 'm not going to be told i 'm unpatriotic or small - minded			2
@entity202 ... ageing pop star needs publicity to promote his new album			0
how to shock ? pose as a @entity207 - like figure singing in a basement bar frequented by priests , a boozy cardinal and some gorgeous semi-clad hookers			0
@entity213 's embarrassing video for his new single @entity214 was removed from @entity215 for ' violating the terms of service ' - in other words for causing offence			1
' @entity213 's embarrassing video for his new single @entity214 was removed from @entity215 for " violating the terms of service " - in other words for causing offence ' later - when the ban made news - it was reinstated with a warning about ' adult content '			1
we 're told @entity213 ' wrote and conceived ' the video - but he 's no @entity231			1
in this parade of hackneyed imagery , the gorgeous @entity232 writhes around in a corset spouting blood from stigmata in her hands , while @entity240 does a feeble impersonation of a priest			0
it is about as subversive as a cup of cocoa			0
the @entity247 church has huge problems , from allegations that abuse has been routinely ignored to the @entity252 's refusal to accept women as bishops , but would @entity213 have had the guts to attack @entity256 in the same way ? blow the whistle on fergie fever @entity261 manager @entity260 arrives on the pitch at @entity263 for the last time before retiring you 'd think @entity34 was mourning the loss of a monarch - the retirement of a football manager has been elevated to an event of national importance			1
sir @entity260 has been touted as one of the great - est businessmen this cen - tury - but , please let 's get his achievements in perspective			1
@entity260 did n't discover a cure for cancer , or find a crop that would feed starving farmers in @entity280			2
as for his wife @entity282 - do we need to worry how she will ' adjust ' to life with her irascible husband hanging around the house ? @entity286 might give pleasure to millions , but during @entity260 's reign , the players were vastly over-rewarded , while the poor , loyal fans paid through the nose			1
a vote for @entity293 thanks to the hundreds of you that wrote and emailed after i told @entity297 off for his patronising suggestion that ' wealthy ' pensioners should hand back their winter fuel allowances			0
@entity301 has done an excellent job of alienating voters - many of you suggested we form the @entity307 and i stand for @entity308			0
removing our entitlements like bus passes seems to be a sure - fire way of committing political suicide - especially as mps enjoy subsidised food and drink in their many in - house hostelries			0
as you point out , free bus passes keep rural services running during the day and we use them to visit town centres , shop ( even if it 's in @entity321 ! ) and meet mates for coffee or ' two for one ' lunches			0
i 'm not sure i want to stand for @entity308 - being a dictator is more my style .			0

*columnist* says @entity1 should be *praised* , not *criticised*
has signed petitions to stop wind farms being built
says we should put @entity335 @entity260 's achievements into perspective
and *wonders* if @entity213 has gone too far in his latest music video
