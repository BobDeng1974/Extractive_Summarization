by @entity0 almost a year ago today the world 's first lab - grown burger was unveiled and eaten , albeit at the mouth - watering price of £ 250,000 ( $ 420,000 )			1
but in anticipation of a future where lab - grown meat is the norm , @entity7 - based scientists , chefs and artists have launched a tongue - in - cheek cookbook for artificial food			1
the bizarre assortment of test - tube dishes includes roast raptor leg , dodo nuggets and in - vitro oysters			2
it comes a year after the first lab - grown burger was unveiled to the public			1
the tongue - in - cheek book envisages food that might one day be eaten the @entity35 was unveiled in @entity26 a year after scientists revealed the world 's first lab - grown beef burger in @entity40 , in what is hoped to spark a global food revolution			1
it looked like something you ’d chuck on the barbecue without a second thought , but this artificial round of meat costs a very beefy £ 250,000 ( $ 420,000 ) - as the world ’s first test - tube burger			2
after the patty was lightly fried in a little butter and sunflower oil last year , the two volunteers chosen to taste it in front of a live audience were hardly effusive , though			0
‘ i was expecting the texture to be more soft , ’ said @entity60 food researcher @entity59 , taking 27 chews before being able to swallow a mouthful			0
‘ it ’s close to meat - it ’s not that juicy			2
’ the second volunteer , food writer @entity68 added : ‘ the absence is the fat			0
but the bite feels like a conventional hamburger			0
what was conspicuously different was flavour			0
’ the 186 - page cookbook will cost £ 19 ( $ 32 ) and is based on the idea that meat can be ' grown ' in a bioreactor from cells taken from live animals			1
it is packed with new suggestions on what future cultivated meat products could look like			0
' this cookbook aims to move beyond in vitro meat as an inferior fake - meat replacement , to explore its creative prospects and visualise what in vitro meat products might be on our plate one day , ' says scientist and philosopher dr @entity93 , one of the book 's main contributors			2
all recipes were created by a team of chefs , designers and artists , said dr van @entity93 in its preface , adding : ' while some dishes are innovative and delicious , others are uncanny and macabre			0
' the book also explains how to cultivate home - grown meat in a lab kit , before harvesting it for the pot. for instance , on page 63 there 's ' @entity115 ' , which uses chicken tissue to grow meat around ' dinosaur bones ' made in a 3d printer to create anatomically accurate models of dinosaur parts			1
' let the dinosaur rest for 15 minutes before carving and serving , ' it suggests after cooking			0
the book includes meat from animals that are extinct in the modern day such as ' @entity127 ' ( shown ) the book ( left ) is available to pre-order now and includes ' instructions ' on how to make a ' bacon roll ' ( right ) one of the pages has rather gruesome instructions on how to make a ' meat foam cocktail ' ( shown ) in another recipe , tissue engineering and advanced genetic sequencing from a dodo sample preserved by the @entity138 will allow history aficionados to ' sample what the first sailors to visit @entity143 did in 1598			1
' there are decidedly less appetising ideas too , for instance oysters grown from meat stem cells			0
' bathed in a warm sea of serum , row upon row of miniature bioreactors nurture small morsels of flesh , ' is how the cookbook describes the test - tube oyster farm			0
' connoisseurs may become adept at picking out the terroir of each lab , from the briny metal overtones of @entity163 serum to the sweeter , more rounded flavour from @entity166 facilities , ' the book said			0
in a future where artificial meat is possible , the scientists suggest we could even eat dinosaur meat lab - grown meat could also be altered so , for example , meatballs could be styled in different colours ( shown ) last year professor @entity176 of @entity177 in southern @entity7 unveiled the so - called ' @entity178 ' in @entity40 , showing that cultured beef using strands of meat grown from muscle cells was indeed possible			1
scientists insist artificial beef is safe , claiming it could eventually replace ordinary beef in the diets of millions of people and in so doing reduce huge environmental pressure caused by raising livestock			1
' our aim is not to promote lab - grown meat , nor to predict the future , but to visualise a wide range of possible new dishes and food cultures to help us decide what future we actually want , ' @entity190 said			1
the scientists say artificially producing meat could help alleviate the strain on livestock in the future			2

scientists in @entity26 have unveiled a cookbook for future artificial meat
it comes a year after the first lab - grown burger was unveiled to the public
the tongue - in - cheek book envisages food that might one day be eaten
it includes meat from animals that are extinct in the modern day
for example one page has a suggestion for ' @entity115 ' while another *discusses* how best to eat ' @entity127 '
authors say it is merely meant to be an example of what could be possible
scientists say lab - grown meat could reduce the huge environmental pressures caused by raising livestock
