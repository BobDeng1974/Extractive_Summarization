by @entity0 the world 's largest wine tasting competition returns to the @entity3 this summer , and it is women who are expected to crack open the @entity5			1
the palate contest , launched by wine merchant - @entity7 , has announced it 's annual search for the @entity3 's best amateur wine taster and is expecting to see more entries than ever before with 25,000 entrants anticipated			1
the last few years have seen a succession of women sip their way to victory with the past two winners being female			1
@entity21 is soon to become one of the less than three hundred @entity33 worldwide and will be one of the younger ones in the @entity3			2
she agrees that when it comes to wine , she is seeing far more of a women 's touch			1
' i think the industry probably is more male dominated , however recent movements have seen women with more dominant roles			2
traditionally women have been less confident in the industry but they have more confidence nowadays			2
' @entity49 gives you the low - down on how the oh - so - sophisticated yet surprisingly simple art of wine tasting			1
' my first most important tip would be to surround yourself with friends , it makes it less complicated and more fun			0
' go for one that 's a bit different			0
' look at the colour if it is pale it will be a lighter drink and if it 's darker it will tend to be heavier			0
' smell it , if it 's fresh and vibrant it will have a lighter taste if it smells spicy it might be more concentrated and richer in flavour			0
' take a good sip , not a gulp but a good sip and try and draw some air through it to open up its flavours			0
' now swallow , there is no point in spitting unless it tastes horrible ! ' see how long the taste stays , if it 's two seconds it is probably not a very good wine , if it 's around twenty then it is a much greater quality			2
' @entity79 says , despite the fact the past three winners of the palate have been women , she does n't necessarily think that women are better wine tasters as such , but she agrees that they are an equal match for men			1
' what i would say is that our last two winners of the palette competition have been women , so they are at least as good as men , but none is better than the other			1
it is just amazing to see so many women engaging in the wine industry			1
' with over ten years experience in the industry , does @entity49 have any advice on what makes a good wine taster ? ' you have to have a mixed knowledge and to know all aspects but it is also about being able to communicate clearly and actively with people about the wine , it 's a pursuit of knowledge			1
' what i always tell my customers is if you like the wine then it 's a good wine ! there are a few faulty wines out there and you can tell if they are if they smell musky or unfresh			2
' even with this advice on board , contestants must ready themselves for some tough competition with only 64 of 25,000 entrants making it through to the semi-finals			0
the competition starts in 35 individual @entity7 branches before the semi-finals that will take place in @entity130 this june			0
the semi-finalists will enjoy the priceless opportunity to learn from one of four renowned wine experts in the @entity3 at a ' boot camp ' , where their taste - buds will be out to the test by the best in the business			1
last year 's judges @entity140 and @entity142 , both @entity33 , will be joined this year by writers @entity143 and @entity145			0
each judge will host their own boot camp for 16 semi-finalists before selecting just four participants each to go forward to the grand final in september			0

@entity165 , managing director of @entity7 , said that despite the fierce competition , they are trying to take away stuffy stereotypes that often come with wine tasting			1
' we are committed to making wine appreciation as unstuffy , approachable and democratic as possible			0
' last year 's finalists , most of whom were incredibly surprised to discover they had a talent for wine appreciation , came from a very diverse range of backgrounds			0
' the format this year introduces some fun rivalry between four of the @entity3 's leading wine experts , who will be tasked with preparing their boot camp winners for the rigours of the grand final			1
' @entity142 , says the competition has the same talent scouting aspects as popular reality tv			0
' the palate is wine 's answer to @entity194			0
it 's a brilliant way for everyone in the country to give wine tasting a go and discover just how good their own palate is			1
the idea is to be challenged , have fun and not feel intimidated by wine , and we can all raise a glass to that ! ' for more information on the palate visit @entity209 - 2014			0
