professor @entity309 from the @entity310 ( @entity310 ) said : ' obviously @entity0 adds instant messaging to @entity6 which must strengthen their position for the moment			1
' equally , all app types rise and fade , so established social media formats like @entity6 will be overtaken by something new , and picking up candidates that might have ultimately replaced them may be a good survival strategy for a while			2
