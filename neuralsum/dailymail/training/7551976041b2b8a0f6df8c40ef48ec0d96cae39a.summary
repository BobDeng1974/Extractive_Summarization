an @entity3 inmate put to death for murder was tortured by his unusually slow execution , the man 's daughter said on friday , as she announced plans to file a lawsuit over her father 's death			1
@entity12 's daughter , @entity11 , referred to the ' agony and terror ' of watching her father as he appeared to gasp in his final moments on thursday , during a previously untried execution method			1
' it was the most awful moment in my life to witness my dad 's execution , ' she said			2
' i ca n't think of any other way to describe it than torture			0
' @entity3 could face a number of legal challenges over the method			0
his family are now suing , saying he was ' tortured ' during the execution upset : @entity35 , left , recounts the execution of her father , @entity12 , as her sister - in - law @entity38 cries at a news conference on friday			1
' i ca n't think of any other way to describe it than torture , ' @entity11 said the execution violated @entity12 's constitutional right not to be treated or punished in a cruel or unusual way , said defense attorney @entity46 , representing @entity38 's adult children			1
@entity38 's attorney @entity48 called the killer 's death ' a failed , agonizing experiment			1
' he added : ' the people of the state of @entity3 should be appalled at what was done here today in their names			1
' @entity38 , 53 , was put to death for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of a pregnant newlywed , @entity59			1
he made loud snorting noises during one of the longest executions since @entity3 resumed capital punishment in 1999			1
nearly 25 minutes passed between the time the lethal drugs began flowing and @entity38 was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m. this is the longest execution in @entity3 since the state resumed capital punishment 15 years ago , records show			1
the next - longest execution was the 22 minutes it took killer @entity72 to die in 2011 , according to an @entity74 analysis of the timelines of the 53 @entity3 executions since 1999			1
@entity72 received a lethal dose of a different drug			0
during the execution he opened and shut his hands as if waving to his son , daughter and daughter - in - law sitting a few feet away and a full minute later he stood up and told them , ' i love you , i love you			2
' anger : @entity38 , left , listens to her husband , @entity12 , at a news conference on friday in @entity90 , @entity3 , where they announced their planned lawsuit over the unusually slow execution of his father , also named @entity12 experimental : @entity38 was executed at this facility by @entity3 's untested execution method punishment : the death chamber at the @entity101 in @entity102			1
@entity3 used intravenous doses of two drugs , midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller , to put @entity38 to death @entity3 has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the @entity114 manufacturer of the previous drug , pentobarbital , stopped allowing its use in lethal injections			1
marketed in @entity121 - speaking countries and @entity122 under the trade names @entity124 , @entity124 , and @entity124 , midazolam is a short - acting sedative in the benzodiazepine class of drugs developed by @entity128 in the 1970s			0
the drug is used for treatment of acute seizures , moderate to severe insomnia , and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures			0
it possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic , amnestic , hypnotic , anticonvulsant , skeletal muscle relaxant , and sedative properties			0
@entity141 is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class			0
it is a derivative of morphine			0
an expert in @entity12 's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what 's known as ' air hunger ' or simply an acute shortness of breath			0
the clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one 's breathing effort			0
it is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations			0
reports from @entity38 's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred			1
as such , the appropriateness of the drugs , and the extent to which they may be cruel , will likely be reviewed by @entity3 officials before they are used in another execution			2
@entity38 was then still for five minutes before emitting a loud snort as if snoring and continued to make this noise for several minutes			0
his stomach rose and fell several times as he repeatedly opened and shut his mouth , making what the @entity180 described as ' deep , rattling sounds			1
' his family sobbed as they watched him slowly die			0
' oh , my @entity185 , ' @entity35 , said as she watched his final moments			1
a coughing sound was @entity12 's last apparent movement , at 10:43 a.m. he was pronounced dead 10 minutes later			2
@entity38 as first injected with the drugs at 10:29 a.m. the convicted murderer 's attorneys had argued against using intravenous doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone , claiming the combination would cause ' air hunger			2
' this medical phenomenon describes where someone experiences immense terror and agony as they strain for breath during the execution			0
the new method was adopted after supplies of a previously used drug dried up because the manufacturer declared it off limits for capital punishment			1
@entity38 's snorts and gasps , and prolonged death , suggest he may have indeed suffered ' air hunger ' and could prompt @entity3 officials to review using the drug cocktail			1
executions under the old method were typically much shorter and did not cause the kind of sounds @entity38 made			0
what was particularly unusual thursday was the five minutes or so that @entity38 lay motionless on the gurney after the drugs began flowing , followed by a sudden snort and then more than 10 minutes of irregular breathing and gasping			0
normally , movement comes at the beginning and is followed by inactivity			0
it 's almost certain lawyers will use @entity38 's execution to challenge @entity3 's plans to put a condemned @entity236 - area killer to death in march			1
a few minutes before @entity38 was put to death , @entity3 prison director @entity238 said he believed the state 's planning would produce ' a humane , dignified execution ' consistent with the law			1
victim : @entity38 , 53 , was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of @entity59 in @entity247 in western @entity3			1
the 22 - year - old @entity248 was newly married and pregnant @entity3 prisons spokeswoman @entity249 had no comment on how the execution went but said a review will be conducted as usual			2
@entity38 's attorney called on @entity254 gov. @entity254 to impose a moratorium on future executions , as did a state death penalty opponent group			1
the move will likely echo across the country as other states contemplate new drug methods , said @entity262 , executive director of the @entity263 , which opposes capital punishment			2
' judges will now realize that the warnings being raised about these untried procedures are not just false alarms , ' he said in an email			0
' @entity270 will now have more of a burden to show that they are using a well thought out best practice			0
' in pressing for the execution to go ahead , state assistant attorney general @entity274 had argued that while the @entity31 @entity278 bans cruel and unusual punishment , ' you 're not entitled to a pain - free execution			1
' @entity31 district judge @entity281 sided with the state			0
but at the request of @entity38 's lawyers , he ordered officials to photograph and preserve the drug vials , packaging and syringes			1
@entity38 , strapped to a gurney in the death chamber , thanked @entity248 's family members , who witnessed the execution , for their ' kind words ' in a letter he apparently received from them			2
crime scene : the pregnant 22 - year - old was found dead in a dark wood , pictured , in 1989 tragic : in the letter @entity302 's sister wrote , she described her 10 - years - younger , adopted sister as the light of her family 's life ' i 'm going to heaven			0
i 'll see you there when you come , ' he said			0
@entity248 's slaying went unsolved for 10 months until @entity38 , jailed on an unrelated assault and hoping to improve his legal situation , told investigators he had information about the death			2
his attempts to pin the crime on his brother - in - law quickly unraveled , and he was accused of the killing			0
more than a decade later , dna evidence confirmed @entity38 's guilt , and he acknowledged his responsibility in a letter to @entity254 last month			2
the death row inmate 's lawyers argued @entity38 was mentally , physically and sexually abused as a child and had impaired brain function that made him prone to act impulsively			2
' we have forgiven him , but that does not negate the need for him to pay for his actions , ' @entity248 's family said in a statement after the execution .			0

convicted killer @entity12 , 53 , took 25 minutes to die - the longest ever execution since @entity3 resumed capital punishment in 1999
@entity38 's stomach rose and fell several times as he loudly gasped and snorted , a death his daughter @entity11 described as ' torture '
his adult children sobbed a few feet away in a witness room as they watched his final moments and his daughter *exclaimed* ' @entity185 '
a two - drug combination was used after supplies of the state 's previous drug dried up
@entity38 's attorney said the execution violated his constitutional right not to be punished in a cruel way and was a ' failed , agonizing experiment '
' the people of the state of @entity3 should be appalled at what was done here today in their names , ' he added
@entity38 was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of @entity59 in @entity247 in western @entity3
