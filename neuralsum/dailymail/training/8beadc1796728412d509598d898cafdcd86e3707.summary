it was an accolade previously held by the @entity1			0
but today , as @entity3 cheered @entity4 to fourth round victory at the @entity6 showcasing yet another affordable gem , it was clear she has earned the title @entity9 of the @entity10			1
despite having her own successful company painting animal portraits - not to mention a boyfriend worth millions - @entity3 always looks to the high street for her courtside outfits			2
but with her glossy hair , expensive highlights and that darn @entity20 bag we 've been coveting for over a year now , she makes absolute bargain @entity10 buys look anything but			0
@entity3 looked chic courtside today wearing a £ 129 printed @entity25 dress - on sale at @entity28 for £ 77 - and fitted denim jacket with @entity31 bracelets , £ 55 , at her wrists @entity3 has managed to keep her trusty @entity34 handbag looking immaculate over the course of a year - it 's a fashion conundrum			1
does she every put it down ? her £ 1,350 @entity34 has proved to be a real favourite			2
she has been carrying it since last year and her fondness shows no sign of abating ( we 're wondering how she has kept it looking so new - does she have multiple , like the @entity9 and her @entity46 bags , or @entity1 and her nude @entity48 pumps ? it 's a conundrum we would love to solve : answers in the comments section below )			0
@entity3 turned up at the @entity52 stadium to support her boyfriend of eight years as he took on @entity56 hope @entity54			1
he may have beat the @entity56 in straight sets , but it was no easy ride - @entity4 fought hard to win , taking him through to the quarter final - and another step closer to picking up the @entity61 for the first time			1
@entity3 cheers @entity64 on as he beats @entity56 hope @entity54 in straight sets @entity3 has attended all of @entity64 's matches in @entity68 so far - but has still had time to work on her tan ... yes , we are a little bit envious @entity4 will next face the winner of the @entity72 match , which is underway now			1
and while it is often pointed out that @entity3 is a loyal girlfriend to @entity4 , it is clear from the tennis ace 's comments that the two are very much a team			2
@entity4 recently praised miss @entity80 ’s ability to gauge when he needs company and when he wants to be alone as ‘ fundamental ’ to their relationship			0
he said : ‘ @entity3 sees all of the emotions when i win or lose a match , she can tell how i ’m really feeling			0
’ and he says that @entity3 helps him from a business perspective too			0
after banking nearly £ 20million in prize money , @entity4 admits to feeling ‘ vulnerable ’ when bombarded by people wanting to do deals , so he relies on ‘ savvy ’ miss @entity80 to spot those trying to leech on to him			0
@entity93 's very visceral reactions to @entity96 's tough @entity95 ... not happy ... happy ! ... outraged ... delighted ! ... tense yet hopeful jubilant ! @entity64 stayed strong during his match - despite @entity54 proving to be a tough opponent graceful in defeat , @entity54 enjoys the reception from fans after the game @entity64 had plenty of fans in the crowd as he stormed to victory @entity64 's mother @entity107 looked quietly confident as she watched the match today @entity3 's £ 129 @entity110 print dress from @entity25 is sold out but her @entity34 bag is still on sale at £ 1,350 a joyful @entity3 carried the same back last week as she celebrated @entity64 winning his round two match against @entity115 of @entity56 last week ' @entity3 's always been there for me ' : in his new book reflecting on his life and career so far , the @entity119 champion is effusive about his girlfriend , who he first met at the @entity124 in 2005 last seen : @entity4 and @entity3 were last pictured together at @entity125 , where he was given an @entity126 in @entity128 shorts and a white blouse to support @entity4 last week at the @entity6 miss @entity80 wore @entity128 again after wearing the designer 's shorts on tuesday - when @entity4 won earlier this year , @entity3 wore an £ 85 blouse from @entity134 , left , and then a £ 150 dress from the same store , right , with her @entity138 blazer to watch @entity64 play tennis @entity3 wore whistles again as she cheered her boyfriend to gold at the @entity143 last summer @entity3 wore a £ 65 bright yellow blazer from @entity138 in january as she watched @entity64 progress to the grand slam final after he defeated @entity72 in five sets @entity3 arrived at @entity119 in july in a colourful £ 49.99 @entity149 dress			1

@entity4 beat @entity56 @entity54 in 4th round match
