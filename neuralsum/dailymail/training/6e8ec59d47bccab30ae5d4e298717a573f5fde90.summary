it might not look like your standard hotel , but this 18 square metre container has everything that a guest would want			1
there is a double bed , a sitting area , a bathroom with shower , a veranda and even breakfast served in the morning			1
what it not normal , however , is that it is moveable			0
hotel chain , @entity17 , has just introduced their portable hotel room : the @entity17 ' to go ' the moveable hotel room was first launched in june 2014 and has visited locations all over @entity21 the portable hotel is the latest marketing gimmick by @entity25 hotel chain , @entity17			1
@entity17 ' to go ' was launched in june 2014 and has so far visited locations all over @entity21			1
it has stood in central @entity28 , in @entity29 in central @entity30 , on a beach in @entity32 and by a lake in @entity34			1
today it 's being positioned onto a marina in @entity37 , a leafy green island in central @entity28			1
the sheer logistics of putting the container in place does limit location options somewhat			2
@entity17 says guests ' preferred spot has to be accessible by road or by boat - and of course be big enough to accommodate the room			1
so a request for the top of a high mountain is unlikely to be approved			2
potential guests can request where they would like the hotel to be set up , but certain locations may not be possible so far , the hotel has stood in central @entity28 , in @entity29 in central @entity30 and on a beach in @entity34 @entity57 , a 33 - year - old property developer , applied to stay in the hotel several months ago			1
in her application she said that she would be happy with any central @entity28 location			1
@entity17 then found the @entity37 location and asked whether she was happy to spend a night there			1
keen to have a night away from the children with her husband she agreed			0
the room costs 2500 kronor per night ( £ 220 ) , which places it in the middle to high end price range of @entity28 hotel rooms			1
but @entity57 says the view of central @entity28 and the waterfront from the veranda is priceless			1
' i do n't think you will get this view in any other hotel room			1
it is really a once in a lifetime opportunity			0
' after looking through the container she says she is also impressed by how the room looks			2
the room itself costs about usd $ 347 or £ 220 , putting it on the higher side of hotel prices in @entity32 room with a view ! there is a sitting area , a bathroom with shower , and even a veranda to enjoy ' first i had a look at the back before coming around to check it out			1
and it exceeds all expectations			0
' the container has a water tank and a sewage tank			2
in most locations @entity17 plugs it in to a local electricity source , but for remote locations there is a generator that can be used			1
' this is really a combination of two trends that we have seen developing , ' says @entity115 , @entity17 vice president of @entity116			2
' the first is the ' to go ' trend			0
you take things with you wherever you want to go			0
you take your coffee and your sushi to wherever you want			0
and the second large trend is the pursuit of experiences			0
people have already experienced so much so just checking in to a regular hotel room is not enough anymore			1
so this is an answer to that particular trend , this is an experience beyond the regular			0
' recent locations where the room was placed include a theme park in central @entity32 in september and at a golf course in @entity32 in early october			2
but there are still some days available where guests can apply for their own preferred locations			0
in even more remote locations , a generator can be used to provide electricity to the pod there are still some dates available where guests can apply to have it set up in their own preferred locations while it may be a brilliant marketing gimmick for the hotel chain , there 's no denying it 's also a fantastic idea @entity115 says that they do get some unorthodox requests , some of which they have to reject for logistical , or legal , reasons			1
' the strangest request we have had was from a prisoner			0
he wanted to put it up in the prison			0
that would have been a rather strange place for it			0
but i guess it could also be some sort of advanced escape attempt , i guess he could have tried to go out with it when we removed it			0
' breakfast is delivered by @entity17 staff each morning and for some locations , such as central @entity28 , @entity17 also provides security guards to keep an eye on the container			1
with all the additional expenses @entity17 does not make much profit on the project , but profit was never the idea according to @entity115			2
' of course we wo n't make much money out of this project			0
but we learn a lot about our guests and we are at the cutting edge of the expansion of available offers			2
that also means a lot , ' he says			0
according to a 2013 report by the @entity198 , @entity28 is the @entity200 's most popular tourist destination with 11 - million overnight stays in 2013 , an increase by 2.5 percent compared to 2012			1
the majority of people visiting @entity28 are domestic tourists and business travellers followed by tourists from @entity208 , the @entity209 and @entity30			2
there are currently nearly 300 hotels in greater @entity28 with a capacity of around 30,000 rooms a night			2
@entity214 , marketing manager for @entity28 says that the @entity17 ' to go ' concept is a marketing gimmick for the @entity17 hotel chain			1
' this is a clever piece of marketing of course			0
they want people to talk about them			0
but of course , it is also very exciting			0
' it is like a caravan but without wheels - you decide where you want to go			0
i 've seen pictures and it looks great and of course it is fantastic to be able to choose where you live and wake up in the morning			0
' visitors can request a location and book at @entity241 .			2

@entity17 's ' to go ' hotel room is an 18 square metre portable container
guests can request it to be set up in almost any @entity21 location
offers double bed , bathroom with shower , electricity and a veranda
has so far been parked in central @entity28 and on a beach in @entity34
