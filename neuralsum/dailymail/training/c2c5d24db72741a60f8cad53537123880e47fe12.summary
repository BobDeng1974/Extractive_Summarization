by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 ’s new man in @entity4 is set to be a @entity6 peer he seems to struggle to get @entity7 to listen to him			1
lord @entity9 – who once tried , and failed , to resign from the government - has been nominated as the @entity3 's candidate to become @entity13 commissioner			1
but just three weeks when asked if he would take the job , he replied : ‘ non , non , non			2
’ lord @entity9 insisted three weeks ago that he did not want the @entity17 job , but his name will be put to a summit in @entity4 this week lord @entity9 had been @entity20 but at a @entity22 summit he on wednesday night his name will be put the @entity24 's 28 national leaders			1
the prime minister said he had picked the former education minister for his ' excellent combination of political and private sector experience '			1
' half his career has been spent in business , half in government at the highest levels , most recently doing an excellent job as @entity35 where he has proven a skilled negotiator respected by all parties , ' he said			0
' and having founded his own company , he also has a strong understanding of the private sector and how the @entity24 can help businesses to generate growth and create jobs			2
' however , the appointment attracted ridicule as it emerged mr @entity7 appeared to have ignored lord @entity9 ’s own misigivings , and not for the first time			1
in 2012 , he secured a meeting with the @entity25 to tender his resignation			0
but instead of accepting – or protesting – lord @entity9 ’s decision , mr @entity7 reportedly told him to carry on his good work , and strode out of the room after being told he was late for a photocall			1
as a result , lord @entity9 remained in post			2
then last month he appeared to rule himself out as a candidate for @entity17			0
asked if he wanted to go to @entity4 , he told the conservative home website : ' non , non , non			0
‘ first , i do n't believe i 'm going to be asked			0
secondly , i like it here			0
i quite like it at home , in the @entity63			0
' in a separate interview with @entity65 , @entity9 also confessed : ‘ i am not very good at thinking long term			2
’ yet his role in @entity4 could be key to mr @entity7 ’s hopes of securing major reform of the @entity24 , before @entity3 holds an in - out referendum in 2017			1
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ sometimes in @entity4 not being seen to campaign for jobs is an effective way to go about your business			1
’ prime minister @entity7 said @entity9 has a strong understanding of the @entity24 lord @entity9 worked in the @entity79 and as special adviser to @entity81 in the 1980s and served in the @entity82 1991 - 2 and as political secretary to prime minister @entity84			1
the choice of @entity9 , ahead of widely - mooted contenders including @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , means that mr @entity7 avoids a potentially difficult by - election			1
lord @entity9 said he believed the @entity3 should play ' a leading role in the @entity24 '			1
' the @entity24 faces two great challenges			0
first , how to spread growth and jobs across @entity13			0
second , how to strengthen public support in many countries for the @entity24 , ' he said			0
' the @entity98 will have a vital role to play in delivering that change			0
' so it 's a huge responsibility to have the opportunity to play a part in reforming the @entity24 but it is one that i am excited to have been offered			1
i look forward to working with @entity106 , other member states and the @entity108 to achieve this change			0
' i also believe that the @entity3 's interests are best served by playing a leading role in the @entity24 , shaping the organisation as it changes to meet the challenges it now faces			1
' in five years ' time , when the next @entity13 elections take place , i want to be able to say to people across @entity13 - including @entity3 - that the @entity98 has heeded their concerns and changed the @entity24 for the better			2
' a @entity120 history graduate , @entity121 cut his teeth politically in the @entity123 , joining in 1985 - two years before @entity7 trod the same path - having decided that a job in the @entity125 was not for him			2
a big break came the following year when he landed a plum position as special adviser @entity81 , then newly promoted to employment minister in @entity131 's @entity130 , and going on to follow his new boss to postings at health and trade and industry			0
after brief stint in @entity138 , the rsie to power of @entity84 saw him return to the world of politics in 1991 with a job in the @entity144			0
his next big break came on the eve of the 1992 general election when mr @entity84 chose him for the crucial post of political secretary			0
he was at the prime minister 's side throughout the campaign , and in the bitter parliamentary battles that followed with the @entity156 over the ratification of the @entity159 treaty			1
@entity160 , chief executive of manufacturers ' organisation @entity161 and chair of @entity165 , the organisation representing @entity13 manufacturing in @entity4 , said : ' @entity9 's nomination is a positive and diplomatic move			2
' it is essential that he secures a key economic portfolio on behalf of the @entity3 so that he can bring some rigour to economic reform and industrial revival in @entity4 , with a focus on further trade deals and supportive and flexible social policies			2

prime minister nominates @entity6 peer as the @entity3 's new @entity24 commissioner
three weeks ago @entity9 said he did not want job and liked living in @entity3
in 2012 , he tried to resign as education minister but the *pm* did not notice
now he will play a key role in @entity7 's hopes of securing @entity24 reform
