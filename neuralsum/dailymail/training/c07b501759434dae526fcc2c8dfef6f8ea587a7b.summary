by @entity0 published : 18:37 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 18:39 est , 23 august 2013 living the high life : speaker @entity3 's stays at top hotels have cost the taxpayer £ 96,000 since 2010			1
his wife @entity6 did not accompany him on the trips @entity3 has billed the taxpayer for stays at some of the world ’s most exclusive hotels , it emerged yesterday			1
documents reveal that the @entity3 has stayed at a string of five - star establishments during official travels costing the taxpayer £ 96,000 since 2010			1
the total includes flights and other costs , but more than £ 10,000 went on hotels			0
despite paying lip service to the need for austerity , the accommodation list for mr @entity3 , who was travelling without his wife @entity6 , suggests a weakness for the finer things in life – particularly when the taxpayer is picking up the bill			1
his stop - offs during taxpayer - funded trips have included the exclusive @entity32 hotel in the @entity34 capital @entity35 , the opulent @entity36 in @entity37 and the @entity38 in @entity39 , where rooms can cost £ 2,000 a night			1
the speaker and an aide ran up a bill of £ 1,062 for a two - night stay at the @entity32 in february last year			1
the hotel – where some rooms cost £ 1,000 a night – boasts ‘ spa - inspired limestone bathrooms ’ , a sky - lit indoor swimming pool with whirlpools and a spa offering ‘ facial treatments and a private aromatherapy steam shower ’			1
in the same month mr @entity3 and an aide ran up a £ 491 bill during a one - night stay at the @entity57 , listed as one of the ‘ world ’s best places to stay ’ by @entity61			1
mr @entity3 also chose to relax in the luxury of @entity64 ’s @entity63 during a trip to the @entity66 in june last year			1
the designer hotel , where room rates this weekend started at £ 395 , claims to be the only five - star hotel on the @entity70 and describes itself as ‘ unique , beautiful and daring ’			0
the speaker and an aide clocked up a £ 1,036 bill for a two - night stay at the @entity74 in @entity75 in february 2011			1
the hotel describes itself as ‘ the renowned address for celebrities ’ visiting the @entity80 capital			0
hypocrite ? mr @entity3 has publicly said @entity66 must do its fair share to cut the deficit but appears to enjoy the finer things in life @entity37 ’s five - star @entity85 is home to one of the city ’s most exclusive nightclubs where , despite @entity94 ’s continuing poverty , bottles of champagne sell for £ 250			1
details of the lavish expenses were revealed following a @entity98 request by the @entity99			0
commons officials initially refused to publish the list of hotels on ‘ security ’ grounds			0
they argued that mr @entity3 ’s safety would be put at risk if people were able to build up a ‘ pattern ’ of the places he stays			2
in fact the list , which has been released following an appeal , shows that mr @entity3 has never stayed in the same hotel twice on his official travels			2
the speaker , who is paid £ 142,162 , has said @entity66 must play its part in cutting the deficit and is driving through a number of cost - cutting measures			1
but his own expenses are anything but modest , with his accommodation list reading like a tour of some of the world ’s finest hotels			0
@entity128 , chief executive of the @entity129 ’ @entity127 , questioned why mr @entity3 had to stay in such lavish accommodation			2
he added : ‘ the speaker ’s gallivanting is an expensive habit that taxpayers can not afford and nor should they			0
‘ @entity3 should lead by example and end his love affair with five - star accommodation			2
it ’s hypocritical for him to dip in taxpayers ’ wallets to pay for grandiose hotel bills given @entity144 ’s necessary drive to cut spending			0
‘ it ’s clear that the speaker realises these expenses are extravagant given his determined attempt to bury the true cost of his globe - trotting			2
’ since the election in 2010 mr @entity3 has visited almost 20 countries , as well as clocking up thousands in expenses for travel in the @entity156 mainly on projects to increase awareness of the work of @entity66			1
the most expensive foreign trip cost a total of £ 11,252 , including business class return flights to @entity163 for mr @entity3 and two aides in september 2010			1
it included a three - night stay at the luxury @entity167 in @entity168			2
commons officials have defended the spending , arguing that it is ‘ an important duty of the speaker to represent @entity66 abroad and foster good relations with fellow speakers and parliamentarians ’			2
a source said officials tried to achieve ‘ value for money ’ when booking the trips , many of which are at the invitation of foreign parliaments			0
but @entity185 mp @entity184 questioned why the @entity156 taxpayer should pick up the bill			0
‘ in such difficult economic times this looks , to the public , quite extravagant , ’ he said			0
‘ that is not good for @entity66 ’s reputation , whatever the motive for the visits			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity3 insisted he often had little say over where he stays			0
the spokesman said : ‘ overseas hotels are usually booked by the hosts and the @entity200 pays the bill – we are therefore not involved in specific arrangements			0
for travel within the @entity156 , hotels are chosen for their proximity to official engagements			0

stop offs included hotels where rooms can cost up to £ 2,000 a night
stayed at @entity57 billed as one of ' world 's best places to stay '
@entity3 has said @entity66 must help reduce the deficit and is driving through cost - cutting measures
but £ 142,162 - a - year speaker appears to enjoy the finer things in life
