the gang from @entity9 , who were based in the cathedral city of @entity12 , struck across the @entity13 and were only caught when police stopped a vehicle laden with stolen lead on the @entity17			1
they made almost £ 70,000 from selling stolen lead over nine months in 2011 , but six of the gang were arrested after being linked to the offences through sales of stolen metal to recycling yards			1
@entity37 is not pictured some of the metal had traces of ‘ smart water ’ which allowed officers to identify from where the lead had been stolen - and police believe they were also responsible for a number of other raids			1
dna evidence left behind on a cigarette butt and a beer can at one church , along with evidence from automatic number plate recognition cameras , also led to some of the gang being identified			0
investigators believe the gang were the main reason for the high number of church thefts last year in @entity60 , when 186 religious buildings were hit - making it the second most affected county			1

‘ these churches were fairly isolated and some of them did not have houses nearby			0
' in some cases it was some time before the thefts were discovered , allowing the ingress of rainwater			0
extensive infrastructure damage was caused to some of the churches			0
’ the crime became so prevalent that the @entity109 , which provides insurance to @entity4 churches , restricted claims to £ 5,000 per church - allowing one claim per year			1

the overall costs to the 20 churches , i am told , is in the region of £ 1million			1
‘ it is a great deal of money			0
it is very important and the distress felt by @entity146 at the desecration of their scared places of divine worship should not be underestimated			0
‘ you lot could not care less about those feelings			0
all you were interested in was stealing lead , weighing it in , and making money			0
’ among the buildings hit in august last year was the @entity115 in @entity116 , near @entity117 , @entity85			0
