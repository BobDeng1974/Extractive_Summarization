@entity0 love their traditional music			2
they have a tv channel devoted to it , and one show – a sort of @entity0 ’s @entity5 for folk acts – features people of all ages swaying in stately unison			1
indeed , they are so proud of the music that when asked to include something in the capsule aboard the @entity16 space probe , they sent tracks from the album @entity19 , in the hope that aliens would like it too			2
colourful outfits ! villagers dressed in the traditional @entity0 costume i love this kind of folklore as long as it really is part of the local culture and not just put on for tourists			2
in @entity0 it is genuine : practically every village in the mountains has at least one choir , and their own particular variation of traditional dress , and many hold festivals in the way that @entity40 villages stage fetes			1
when i decided to go to @entity0 i looked for a holiday combining exploring the remote southern mountains with a festival			1
despite much trawling on the internet , i could n’t find a package on the right dates , so instead i combined a group walking tour with an independent excursion of my own			1
i began by joining a group of 11 other walkers , led by a guide who , it turned out , danced as naturally as she walked			2
we stayed in a village called @entity58 high in the remote @entity60 mountains			1
golden wonder ! the autumnal colours shine on the @entity60 mountains in @entity0 apart from the hotel , @entity58 was totally devoid of any tourist infrastructure			1
the hole in the wall was not a cash machine but a spring			2
for the people living there , the end of communism did not appear to have resulted in a dramatic increase in consumer choice – the only two shops sold the barest of necessities			2
each morning we set off through pine forests and scrambled above the tree line to meadows so full of wild flowers that i counted 22 varieties in one square metre as i was having my picnic			0
we walked up to nine miles every day			1
the level of difficulty was described as ‘ moderate ’ but i found it quite challenging			0
unlike most of the other members of the group , i did n’t have walking poles , so i picked up two sticks and tapped along until i got into a rhythm			1
@entity95 in @entity60 in part of the @entity97 and was the result of an earthquake that made the huge cave in the marble bed of a river on the way down , we walked past fields of potatoes – the staple diet in the mountains – and through @entity109 villages , a legacy of the @entity112 empire			1
it was easy to see why folklore survived in these places as they are so cut off from the outside world			0
at the end of one walk we scrambled down to the @entity121 cave system , its luminescent stalactites and stalagmites dripping eerily as they have done for millions of years			1
evidence of prehistoric man was displayed almost casually , including a mug with a handle that looks as if it could be used to served tea today			0
picturesque scenery ! old stone bridge and mountain stream near the cave of @entity58 on my last evening , a group of villagers came to the hotel to entertain us			0
rashly , some of us agreed to put on traditional costumes too and dance rather inelegantly with them			0
when i came to leave the group the next morning , i had to sign a release form saying i was responsible for my own actions , which made my trip to the festival seem more adventurous than it really was			0
i splashed out on a cheap taxi for the trip across the mountains to the ski resort of @entity152 ( the one place i do n’t want to go back to )			1
next morning , things became more difficult as the locals use the cyrillic alphabet which i found impenetrable , so i could n’t read the destination on the bus timetable			0
trees covered in a fresh snowfall on @entity161 , in the @entity162 fortunately , a woman , who told me in broken @entity40 that her daughter was picking tomatoes in @entity166 , spooned me on to a crowded minibus to the @entity162 mountains			1
through the trees came the sound of singing and the banging of drums			0
each village had a stage of its own where its people performed their songs and were awarded certificates for participating			1
traditionally , women are n’t allowed to play instruments so they sang while the men played flutes , fiddles and drums			0
traditional @entity0 national costume worn by villagers in the @entity162 mountains it was a joyous occasion , put on for their own pleasure , not for tourists			2
once the certificates had been awarded , everyone joined in , regardless of whether they were wearing traditional costume or jeans			0
i resisted invitations to dance and just sat and watched			0
a young teacher said she ‘ revered ’ their customs			0
‘ i hope you are getting a good impression of @entity0 , ’ she said			0
