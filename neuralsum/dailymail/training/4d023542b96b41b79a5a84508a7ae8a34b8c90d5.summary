' she was then asked if she was saying that she did not think he was suitable as a president			2
she said : ' you know what political figures are like			0
they do n't become president if they 're not self - centred , or if they 're not sometimes economic with the truth			0
' i 've followed other presidents in my professional career , i 've only known one intimately , but the majority of them have these faults , in that they 're completely egocentric			0
