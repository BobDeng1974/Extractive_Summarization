@entity1 victims of horrific acid attacks are relying on the generosity of strangers to help them after failing to get any financial support from their government			1
acid attacks are sadly not uncommon in @entity1 , often targeting women in public places as a form of revenge linked to family disputes , sexism or misogyny			0
one victim , @entity15 , 18 , was disfigured and lost an eye after her brother - in - law and his friends pinned her down and doused her face with acid			1
@entity21 : it is thought @entity15 , 18 , was singled out for an attack because of her beauty and popularity disfigured : her brother - in - law and his friends threw acid in her face @entity15 's elder sister @entity29 , whose estranged husband carried out the attack in may , witnessed the assault and suffered burns on her arms , but wishes she had been the main target			1
the family believe @entity15 was singled out because of her beauty and popularity			2
the once pretty and out - going commerce student now describes her face as ' so scary ' as she has an empty eye socket and painful scars			1
she no longer socialises with friends but hides away in her family 's cramped @entity43 home			0
she faces lifelong scars and the social stigma attached to being an acid attack victim			2
@entity15 should have received swift state aid after @entity1 's top court ruled that victims were entitled to 100,000 rupees ( £ 1015 ) within 15 days of an assault and a total of 300,000 rupees ( £ 3046 ) in compensation			1
but , five months later , she is yet to receive a penny			2
' one of my eyes is ruined , yet no help is coming , ' said @entity15			2
in pain : @entity15 's mother attempts to ease some of her discomfort by rubbing a cream on her scars ' no help is coming ' : the teenager reveals she has yet to receive any compensation @entity15 , the adored youngest child of a taxi driver , was attacked in her family 's northern home state of @entity70 , and the fact that she lives in @entity43 complicates her claim			1
her relatives have clubbed together and taken out loans for her treatment , but doctors have said she may need up to 10 more operations			0
' after that things will be better , but still nothing will be alright , ' @entity15 said			2
now she is relying on donations to help her get the treatment she needs after the volunteer network ' make @entity83 ' , have set up a crowdfunding page on the website @entity86 on her behalf			0
the immediate target is £ 1,367 , although her overall costs are expected to be much higher			0
the group have previously successfully raised money for another @entity1 acid attack victim , @entity92 , who is now receiving treatment			1
as she was : since the attack , the once out - going @entity15 has become reclusive desperate for justice : her family have clubbed together to raise money for @entity15 's treatment but it 's not enough so now a crowdfunding page has been set up for her make @entity83 turned to the internet to help victims after becoming frustrated by the lack of government aid			1
@entity15 and @entity92 are not the only ones who have n't received compensation despite the steps taken to help improve the situation for survivors			1
@entity111 of the @entity114 - based @entity113 campaign group said : ' still there 's no awareness on the issue ... people do n't know how to apply for compensation			0
the authorities do n't know			0
' he said he knew of no - one who had received the initial 100,000 rupees within 15 days of an assault , while only two in 100 cases had managed to win the full 300,000 rupees			1
he added that even if claims were successful , the figure is ' not at all enough ' for the costly and multiple plastic surgeries required			0
life changing injuries : @entity15 lost an eye as a result of acid being thrown on her campaign for change : the teen wants more to be done to stop other women suffering from her fate bringing the perpetrators of acid attacks to justice is another controversial area			1
last year , acid attacks were made a specific criminal offence in @entity1 punishable with at least a decade behind bars			0
but court cases can drag on for years			0
in @entity15 's case , her brother - in - law was arrested and jailed , but a juvenile in the gang has been freed on bail and two other accomplices remain at large , according to her family			1
' the police do n't say anything , they do n't search anything , ' @entity15 said			0
she added that she wants them apprehended so ' they should not be able to do to other girls what they have done to me			0
' @entity162 of @entity163 added that , particularly in northern states , ' police are not very cooperative and we have heard of cases where they try to get families to change their statement			0
' meanwhile , the @entity171 in july last year gave @entity1 states three months to enforce restrictions on the sale of acid , but campaigners say it remains easy to purchase - making future attacks likely .			2
