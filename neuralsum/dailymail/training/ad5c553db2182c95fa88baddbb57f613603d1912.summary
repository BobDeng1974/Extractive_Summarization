by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 29 may 2013 the @entity8 , with help from @entity4 product designers at @entity5 and @entity7 illustrators , has developed a mapping - style ' game ' prototype that could be used to launch cyberattacks at the click of a button			1
dubbed ' @entity15 ' the system uses @entity17 touch table technology to control network topologies - or a group of connected nodes - that look like ' constellations of stars '			1
military strategists can press a node to open a drop - down menu that lets them visualise all possible attack scenarios and choose exactly how and where to send the attack			1
this is n't exactly what the prototype looks like because @entity39 is keeping the design a secret for security reasons			2
the prototype includes red ' target ' nodes as well as ' weapon packages ' and ' battle unit ' nodes using a @entity51 touch table , the mission name is shown in the top right - hand corner of the screen along with a red star showing the attack target			1
below it is a network of connected nodes			1
tapping on the red ' target ' star causes blue wedges to pop up around it , with icons such as lightning bolts or disks , as well as a number			2
these numbers correspond to ' weapon packages ' each containing different types of weapons , with different costs and risks associated with them			0
strategists can then pick battle units that detail the method of the intended attack			1
other battle units can be selected to track how the mission is going , and strategists can change course if need be			0
as each node is selected , new routes appear along the network and become more detailed			1
a prototype of the system was exclusively revealed to @entity83 from @entity84 by @entity85 , a cybersecurity specialist who has been developing @entity86 he told @entity83 : ' say you ’re playing @entity88 , and you ’ve got this type of sword , +5 or whatever			1
' you do n’t necessarily know what spells were used to create that sword , right ? ' you just know it has these attributes and it helps you in this way			1
' it ’s the same type of concept			0
you do n’t need the technical details			0
' using a @entity51 touch table , @entity85 explained that the mission name is shown in the top right - hand corner of the screen along with a red star showing the target , which in this instance was the botnet 's server			1
@entity85 taps on this red ' server ' star and four blue wedges pop up around it , with icons such as lightning bolts or disks , as well as a number			0
these numbers are ' weapon packages ' each containing different types of weapons , with different costs and risks associated with them			0
the team behind @entity86 use a @entity51 touch table to manipulate the network topology			1
as each node is pressed , menu options appear			0
as more options are selected , more nodes appear and the more intricate the choices become			2
strategists will be able to map out entire cyberattack scenarios using the system , weighing up cost and risk , before an attack is launched @entity85 continued : ' maybe some technologies were more expensive to develop			1
maybe it ’s more risky or controversial			0
' maybe we spent $ 5 million building x , and if we use it , there ’s a 50 % chance we might lose it			0
' although he adds that the numbers are meaningless on the prototype , they ’re meant to convey each cyberattack has a different cost associated with it			2
during the demonstration , @entity85 picked a weapon package called @entity151 , which cost him 10 points			2
he then picked from a list ' battle units '			0
@entity84 explained that these could potentially include downloading rootkits or launching a denial of service attack , although @entity85 was reluctant to use these specific terms			2
other units could measure how successful the mission is and as @entity85 selected nodes , new routes along the network appeared and became more detailed			1
the @entity8 announced @entity39 was working on @entity86 in october last year , in a bid to upgrade its military force to be better prepared to fight in the digital age			1
at the time @entity39 appealed for help from labs , universities and computer - game programmers to help create a team of cyber warriors			1
it was the first time the @entity175 government had sought outside support for its cyber strategies the @entity8 announced that @entity39 was working on @entity86 in october last year , in a bid to upgrade its military force to be better prepared to fight in the digital age			1
at the time @entity39 appealed for help from labs , universities and computer - game programmers to help develop these new cyber technologies			1
it was the first time the @entity175 government had sought outside support for its cyber strategies , and was hoping it would work in a similar way to its other military contracts			2
for example , @entity189 holds contracts with the military to build conventional weapons			0
the @entity8 was quick to add that @entity86 would not fund the development of cyberweapons , but instead it would work to create tools to make existing ones more effective			1
experts claimed that this would range from taking out power grids to disabling a pacemaker in an enemy combatant			0
@entity203 : the @entity8 's project titled ' @entity86 ' was launched in october 2012			1
it hopes to improve the @entity175 military 's ability to wage cyberwars and prevent cyberattacks the program hopes the development of new technologies will allow the military to ' dominate the cyber battlespace , ' while simultaneously implementing a clearer strategy for using cyberattacks			1
@entity86 has already received $ 110 million in funding for the next five years , which it hopes to dole out in military contracts to researchers around the country			0
' if they can do it , it ’s a really big deal , ' @entity221 , a cybersecurity expert with the @entity222 told the @entity225			0
‘ if they achieve it , they ’re talking about being able to dominate the digital battlefield just like they do the traditional battlefield			0
' one of the main priorities for @entity86 was creating this comprehensive , visual map that plots out the digital locations of tens of billions of computers around the world			0
outside help : the military is offering contracts to the private sector to encourage the development of new technology			0
@entity5 and illustrators from the @entity245 films have already joined the team this can be used to identify and target hostile servers and networks that they could then disable			2
they also hope to create a stronger operating system that will allow for quicker attacks , while also making computers at home less susceptible to foreign attacks			1
officials told the @entity225 that they hope this new system will look like an armored truck when compared to the suv that is existing computer operating systems			2
@entity86 also hopes to set guidelines on how and when to use cyberattacks			2
ultimately , they hope to use the prototype and have other technology and organisational capabilities in place to be able to carry out smaller , more precise attacks orchestrated by individual commanders in the field			0
the practical uses , though still far out , are incredible , says @entity273 , an information warfare professor at @entity275 's @entity274			0
specifically , he explains how eliminating power grids can be much more effective and less detrimental than during the conflicts in @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281			0
' in all of those conflicts , ' he said , ' we went after the other side ’s electricity with bombs			0
' but now , the military can be much more humane , taking out power only when necessary and then being able to quickly restore it , without having to build an entirely new grid .			0

@entity4 product designers and @entity7 illustrators help @entity8 create system that can plan and launch cyberattacks as well as head off improve cyber defences
the new mapping ' game ' uses touch tables and a network of connected nodes to weigh up the cost and risk behind each attack
