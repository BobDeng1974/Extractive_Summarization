the @entity0 has been voted the worst female beauty sin , topping a list of crimes that includes foundation tidemarks , spidery eyelashes and caked - on powder			1
the dark , angular , pencilled - in brow look has been showcased over the years by @entity9 celebrities @entity10 and @entity11 - but has recently fallen out of favour as girls go for a more natural power brow look like @entity15 's			1
the survey , which found that over-plucking the brows is almost as offensive as pencilling them in too strong , revealed also that women are harsher judges of each other 's looks than they are of men 's			1
@entity23 @entity10 and @entity11 have both fallen victim to the so - called @entity0 in the past - a strong , dark , angular pencilled - in brow the study found that 78 per cent of women would negatively judge a woman with badly applied make - up , and a particularly disparaging 22 per cent would even refuse to socialise with women who happened to be poorly presented			1
in what is no doubt a blow to sisterhood , the new survey showed that the fairer sex are nearly five times more likely to judge a woman by her appearance than a man			2
the survey of over 1,000 women revealed that 78 per cent of women admitted they would look negatively upon a woman whose make - up was poorly applied			1
over half added that they would view a woman with badly applied make - up as grubby and lacking in essential presentation skills with one fifth of women adamant that a woman with bad make - up would not be welcome in their social circle			0
the @entity0 came top in the list of deadly beauty sins with women saying it was the worst beauty blunder			1
other cosmetics crimes included foundation tidemarks on the face , patchy fake tan and concealer on the lips			2
a particularly disparaging 22 per cent would even refuse to socialise with women who are poorly presented @entity68 eyebrows , too much mascara and clumped ' spidery ' eyelashes also took a lashing as the worst face faux pas			2
scouse brow 21.2 % 2			0
foundation tidemarks 20.4 % 3			0
patchy fake tan 16.4 % 4			0
concealer lips 9.3 % 5			1
@entity68 eyebrows 8.7 % 6			0
@entity79 ' spidery ' eyelashes 6.7 % 7			0
caked - on powder on face 4.5 % @entity82 from @entity83 who conducted the survey said : ' it 's no secret that many women these days like to take an interest in other women 's appearances - whether positively or negatively			1
' of course it 's never nice when this leans towards the malicious side of the spectrum			0
' ' a lot of these beauty ' sins ' can easily be avoided by paying a little more attention when getting ready , though			0
' as for the @entity0 coming up trumps in the list of blunders - style icons like @entity102 and @entity15 both have bold brows , which have become an intrinsic , much - coveted element of their looks			2
' so it seems that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder			0
