a failure in @entity2 handwriting analysis 14 years ago meant that @entity3 was free to kill again , according to a search warrant			1
@entity3 , a member of a wealthy @entity6 real estate family , was arrested in @entity7 over the weekend and charged with murder for the shooting of @entity10 in december 2000			2
police focused on @entity3 's handwriting 14 years ago , after a note in an envelope tipped them off to @entity10 's death			1
but a document examiner wrongly concluded that the handwriting did not match @entity3 's			1
he escaped police attention for years , partially due to a failed handwriting analysis 14 years ago writing on the note and envelope , which was written in block lettering , misspelled ' @entity47 ' and included the word ' cadaver ' along with @entity10 's @entity51 address			1
in 2001 , @entity2 document examiner @entity52 concluded it was ' highly probable ' that it was written by @entity55 , @entity10 's manager and friend			2
the assessment was ' rubber stamped ' by @entity52 's supervisor , who told detectives in september that she had not backed the findings up with an independent technical review			0
investigators had initially failed to analyze examples of @entity3 's handwriting , and it was n't until eight months later that a comparison was made			1
@entity52 said ' similarities ' were enough to request more writing samples , which police eventually obtained			0
in june 2003 , @entity52 revised his assessment to conclude that the handwriting was likely @entity3 's			1
the conflicting analyses meant that valuable time lost			1
by then , @entity3 had been charged in @entity75 with the murder and dismemberment of @entity78			0
investigation : law enforcement officers stand outside the @entity3 's @entity82 home forensic : @entity3 himself may have implicated the property in a recording made while talking to himself after a tense interview for the @entity21 series eventually , the envelope , letter and writing samples were sent to the @entity92 and an investigator concluded that @entity3 was ' probably the author of the cadaver letter and note '			1
the @entity97 case went dormant , and was n't revived until 2012 , when law enforcement learned of a six - part @entity21 series about his links to three killings entitled @entity103 : the @entity104 of @entity3			2
he is suspected of killing his first wife , who disappeared in @entity6 in 1982 ; @entity10 , the daughter of a mobster , who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared ; and a 71 - year - old neighbor in @entity75 , whose dismembered body was found floating in @entity111 in 2001			2
the filmmakers say they shared tape with police months ago of interviews with @entity3 , including his reactions to handwriting analysis and what appears to be a confession to @entity10 's killing			1
in october and november , the @entity2 had two independent examiners analyzed the documents and both concluded that @entity3 was the author			2
@entity3 was arrested earlier this month , shortly before the finale of the @entity21 documentary			0
he has only ever been tried for the @entity75 killing , and he was acquitted of murder			0
authorities on tuesday searched @entity3 's @entity82 home , and the warrant released wednesday details the timeline of the @entity10 case			1
the @entity2 has declined comment until @entity3 is in its custody			0
he is currently being held in @entity136 on gun charges			0
@entity3 's attorney , @entity138 , said the conflicting determinations on the handwriting ' shows you what junk science really is			1
' he also questioned what evidence police expected to find in @entity3 's @entity82 home			1
but @entity3 himself may have implicated the property in a recording made while talking to himself after a tense interview for the @entity21 series , which concluded sunday			2
just before saying he ' killed them all , ' he says , ' i do n't know what 's in the house '			0
the search warrant affidavit showed that authorities were concerned @entity3 , who has an estimated net worth of $ 100 million , might be preparing to flee the country			0
he had withdrawn large sums of money from multiple bank accounts , including daily amounts of $ 9,000 , for 35 days starting in october			0
@entity3 was under @entity164 surveillance			0
agents arrested him in a @entity7 hotel under the name ' @entity169 , ' finding nearly $ 43,000 in cash , a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his room , the affidavit says			0
a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said that it was a kind of ' old man mask ' , and investigators were looking at whether he had been using it to travel anonymously			0
@entity3 could face the death penalty if convicted of killing @entity10 .			2

in 2001 , police analysed the handwriting on a note *alerting* them to the death of @entity10
they wrongly concluded that it did n't match @entity3 's writing
this meant that valuable time was lost
@entity197 is suspected of three *brutal* murders
