passengers and crew of the missing @entity5 flight most likely died from suffocation as the plane coasted into the ocean on autopilot , @entity1 officials have said			1
in a new 55 - page report , the @entity10 said investigators arrived at the conclusion after comparing conditions on the flight with previous disasters			0
the news comes as authorities announced the @entity1 - led search will now focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area further south in the @entity21			1
' given these observations , the final stages of the unresponsive crew / hypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of @entity5 's flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction , ' the @entity10 report said			0
officials said this suggested the plane was most likely to have crashed further south than previously thought			1
they said they are confident the @entity47 , carrying 239 people , was set to autopilot several hours before its demise into desolate and unmapped waters			0
deputy prime minister @entity23 said : ' it is highly , highly likely that the aircraft was on autopilot otherwise it could not have followed the orderly path that has been identified through the satellite sightings			1
' the new analysis comes more than 100 days after the plane disappeared on march 8 shortly after taking off from @entity59 bound for @entity60			1
mr @entity23 said the new phase of the search could take more than a year and involves mapping 23,000 square miles of ocean , while the previous search area was only 330 square miles investigators say what little evidence they have to work with suggests the plane was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route before eventually plunging into the @entity21			1
the search was narrowed in april after a series of acoustic pings thought to be from the plane 's black box recorders were heard along a final arc where analysis of satellite data put its last location			1
but a month later , officials conceded the wreckage was not in that concentrated area , some 1,600 km ( 1,000 miles ) off the northwest coast of @entity1 , and the search area would have to be expanded			1
the new analysis comes days after @entity85 police said pilot @entity86 , 53 ( pic ) , is the main suspect in the disappearance ' the new priority area is still focused on the seventh arc , where the aircraft last communicated with satellite			1
we are now shifting our attention to an area further south along the arc , ' @entity93 told reporters in @entity99			2
@entity23 said the area was determined after a review of satellite data , early radar information and aircraft performance limits after the plane diverted across the @entity85 peninsula and headed south into one of the remotest areas of the planet			1
the next phase of the search is expected to start in august and take a year , covering some 60,000 sq km at a cost of a $ 60 million ( $ 56 million ) or more			2
the search is already the most expensive in aviation history			0
the new priority search area is around 2,000km west of @entity115 , a stretch of isolated ocean frequently lashed by storm force winds and massive swells			2
two vessels , one @entity121 and one from @entity123 engineering company @entity122 , are currently mapping the sea floor along the arc , where depths exceed 5,000 metres in parts			0
a tender to find a commercial operator to conduct the sea floor search closes on monday the new search area has been the subject of an aerial search previously , but efforts will now head below the waves , combing the ocean floor which is some 5km deep in parts			1
the shift was expected as the head of the @entity10 , @entity140 , said last week it would move south			0
' this site is a most likely place where the aircraft is resting , ' he said			0
' the search is going to be painstaking â€“ of course we could be fortunate and find it in the first hour or the first day , but it could 12 months			0
' mr @entity23 said @entity1 remained dedicated to the task of solving ' this greatest aviation mystery in total history			2
' @entity5 vanished during a flight from @entity59 to @entity60 on march 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard the new analysis comes just days after @entity158 pilot @entity86 , 53 , was revealed to be the prime suspect behind the plane 's disappearance			2
@entity85 police made the announcement after discovering files on @entity86 's home flight simulator showing he practiced landing on small airfields , including several in the @entity21			2
the files had been deleted from the computer before officials seized it , but have since been recovered by detectives			0
the criminal inquiry completed intelligence checks on all of the people on board the flight to @entity60 via @entity59 , but the only individual arousing suspicion was captain @entity86			0
the father - of - three was found to have no social or work - related future plans , unlike the rest of the crew including his co-pilot , @entity180			0
the criminal inquiry , which is yet to rule out other reasons for the plane 's disappearance including a mechanical failure and terrorism , has so far only released its results to foreign governments and their investigators .			0

officials say new analysis suggests plane crashed further south than previously thought
@entity1 deputy *pm* says it is ' highly likely ' plane was on autopilot
search operation will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area further south in the @entity21 based on new satellite *projections*
