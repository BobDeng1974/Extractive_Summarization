by @entity0 follow @ @ adamjshergold @entity3 coach @entity2 's glamorous girlfriend @entity1 kept a close eye on the progress of the team as they trained on thursday ahead of their ' @entity10 ' clash with @entity11			1
wearing shades and a baseball cap to keep out the strong @entity15 sun in @entity16 , miss @entity1 watched on from the sidelines as her partner @entity2 took the session			2
with two days left , the coach must make a decision over whether to play the in - form striker @entity22 against @entity11 in their opening group d clash at the @entity24 in @entity25			1
close watch : @entity2 's girlfriend @entity1 checks on the progress of the @entity3 team as they trained in @entity30 ahead of saturday 's @entity32 opener against @entity11 in @entity25 blowing a kiss ? @entity2 poses for the camera as he leads @entity3 's training session close to their @entity37 base @entity22 , who scored 23 goals in 34 matches for @entity41 last season , proved he could adapt easily to the international stage when scoring a hat - trick and setting up two more goals in @entity3 's 5 - 3 win over @entity47 on sunday			1
that result was welcome after disappointing draws against the @entity49 and @entity50 suggested the @entity3 were far from ready to tackle a group containing @entity11 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
even though @entity3 have not yet made the four - hour flight up to @entity25 , where temperatures are expected to top @entity56 during the @entity11 game , some of their players seemed to be struggling with the heat			1
@entity62 and @entity63 looked to be among those struggling as the sun beat down on their training at the @entity68			2
hot work : @entity62 and @entity63 take a breather as @entity3 trained in sweltering conditions at the @entity68 selection dilemma : @entity2 must decide whether to play in - form @entity41 striker @entity22 against @entity74 's men dream partnership : immobile could start up front alongside @entity62 ( left ) in @entity25 despite pre-tournament expectations in @entity3 being quite low , @entity79 coach @entity78 has called for unity and a belief that they can advance to the latter stages of the tournament			1
@entity78 told the team to take inspiration from his @entity79 side that won the @entity89 last season			0
' when you take part in a @entity32 there is always a lot of excitement and tension and everyone needs to chip in if you want to achieve something big , ' said @entity78 in a letter published in @entity100			0
' however , people are sceptical about our chances , and do not believe in us			0
well , i can guarantee that if the team and the coaching staff stay united and all read from the same page , then the atmosphere will become more favourable , and results are more likely to go our way			0
inspiration : @entity78 has called on @entity3 to follow the achievements of his @entity79 side in the @entity89 and advance far in the @entity32 close control : @entity62 ( left ) , @entity115 ( middle ) and @entity117 perform keepie - uppies on the training pitch leader of the pack : @entity63 leads ( left to right ) @entity122 , @entity115 , @entity123 and @entity62 in the warm - ups still got it : @entity2 in the thick of things during training as @entity3 prepare for the @entity11 clash on saturday ' that is how @entity79 won the @entity89			1
that 's why now it 's important to encourage @entity132 to get behind our lads			0
' the @entity132 admitted that @entity2 's side are far from being the tournament favourites , but also pointed out @entity3 were unfancied before the victorious @entity137 of 1982 and 2006			2
' we are in a difficult group , ' admitted @entity78 , ' but our opponents should be worried about our presence in it			0
one thing is for certain , facing @entity3 is difficult for every team			0
we are a strong team tactically , we are experienced and we have players that can make the difference			0

@entity3 train close to their @entity37 base ahead of flight to @entity25
*azzurri* open their @entity32 *campaign* against @entity11 on saturday night
@entity2 faces selection dilemma as @entity22 *pushes* for *inclusion*
@entity62 and @entity63 appeared to be feeling the heat in session
