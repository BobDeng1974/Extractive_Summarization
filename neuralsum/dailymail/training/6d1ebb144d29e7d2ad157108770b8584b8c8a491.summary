by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 4:45 pm on 20th october 2011 it is a haunting scene which could have come straight from a @entity4 film set - a lone female protester stands clutching a crucifix against a desolate backdrop of burning caravans and smouldering embers			2
but the carefully - crafted image at @entity11 is not all that it seems – far from it			1
for the woman in the picture is not even one of the travellers who had vowed to ‘ fight to the death ’ for their homes			2
despite this , she has made it onto the front pages of the majority of national newspapers			2
not even a traveller : @entity24 holds aloft a crucifix at the @entity11 site amid the burning rubble			1
she 's a regular at the site for three years in the lead up to the eviction at the illegal camp she is actually an agitprop activist who hurries to join anarchist groups wherever they are gathered			1
yesterday 45 - year - old @entity24 was at @entity35 ’s biggest illegal travellers ’ site likening the plight of its inhabitants to the suffering of the @entity39 in @entity40			2
her devotion to the cause is plain for all to see - indeed her zealous belief in trying to save the site from the bailiffs is so strong that it has brought her into conflict with her fellow activists			2
during meetings around the camp fire in the weeks before the final showdown , she would often interrupt a speaker to insist her point was heard			0
darkness and flames : riot police stand in front of the floodlit scaffold entrance to the illegal site a silhouetted image of @entity24 , who also calls herself @entity61 , against a backdrop of smoke and fire ‘ we love her desire to help the travellers , but sometimes we need a break from her because she can be a pain in the neck , ’ said one protester			1
miss @entity24 ’s activism was borne out of a troubled childhood characterised not by idealism but by violence			0
growing up on the streets of @entity77 in @entity78 in the 1970s , raised by a mother and stepfathers , she joined one of the capital ’s first girl gangs , called @entity84			1
at 13 , she was ‘ locked up ’ in a government assessment centre for two years and then lived on the streets for another eight years			1
after moving to @entity87 in south - east @entity78 , she became an active member of the anarchist group @entity89 , which campaigns against globalisation by holding impromptu parties on major roads to cause disruption			1
a face of anger : @entity24 emerges from a tatty caravan waving her cross			0
she has also alienated fellow protesters with her outspoken and misguided views clashes : a traveller , and unlink @entity24 a full - time @entity11 resident , turns on her heels as police enter the site yesterday			1
right , one of @entity24 's crowd is pulled down from the scaffolding at the entrance to the site miss @entity24 , whose real name is believed to be @entity112 , then turned her attention to trying to stop child abuse and gang culture			1
she regularly appears in her local paper trying to drum up support for her latest campaign and has spoken at numerous demonstrations			0
the activist ’s three current campaign groups are the ‘ @entity122 ’ , the ‘ @entity123 ’ and the ‘ stop the @entity124 ’			0
her recent internet posts reveal the extent of her anti-capitalist and anarchist credentials			0
in one post she wrote : ‘ are you ready for the revolution ’			0
and when she became aware of the issues surrounding @entity11 , miss @entity132 was quick to get on board			1
the professional activist , who also calls herself @entity135 , first started visiting @entity137 ’s largest traveller site three years ago			0
she claims she is directly related to some of the travellers on @entity11			1
during interviews yesterday , miss @entity24 was keen to describe the suffering of the travellers			0
‘ there is a lot of police brutality going on , ’ she declared			0
she claimed a woman traveller ’s back had been broken by the police when they stormed the compound			0
officials said the woman had in fact been admitted to hospital with minor spinal discomfort .			0

other @entity11 protestors claim she is a ' pain in the neck '
she joined @entity78 's first girl gang and was ' locked up ' at 13
