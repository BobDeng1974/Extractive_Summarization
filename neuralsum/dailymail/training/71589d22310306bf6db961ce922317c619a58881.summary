by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 16:48 est , 2 june 2013 @entity1 , pictured with daughter @entity2 , became curious about what could have caused her bolt of panic giving birth is one of the most momentous challenges in a woman 's life			1
for the rare few , it is an unmitigated joy ; for most , an excruciatingly painful means to an end			0
for some women , though , like @entity16 , childbirth is truly terrifying - but not for the reasons you 'd expect			1
her two daughters , @entity21 , 16 , and @entity2 , seven , were born nine years apart in very different circumstances			1
but common to both births was @entity1 's sixth sense that something terrible was about to happen			1
' on both occasions labour stopped when i was exactly 4cm dilated			0
quite simply , i froze with fear and my whole body seemed to go into lockdown			0
i had to have a traumatic emergency caesarean section			0
' following @entity2 's birth , @entity1 , 45 , became curious about what could have caused this sudden bolt of paralysing panic , and decided to look into her family history			1
what she discovered shocked her			0
a hundred years ago , as her great - grandmother was giving birth to @entity1 's grandmother , her toddler son 's clothing caught alight on an open fire and he came running into the room in flames			1
he died three days later			2
the overwhelming panic she 'd encountered was sudden and came out of nowhere , probably much like that experienced by her poor relative all those years ago			1
could she have inherited the sense of trauma from her great - grandmother ? there is no doubt that a woman 's experience of childbirth is often similar to her mother 's and grandmother 's			1
most doctors and midwives recognise the likelihood that we will inherit a physiological similarity from our mothers			0
but could ' ancestral memory ' of specific events and experiences also play a part ? @entity1 's labour stopped when she was 4cm dilated with both @entity21 , now 16 , and @entity2 , now seven having interviewed many women for a book i 've co-written on the subject , i am convinced the answer is yes			2
from the impact of war , to illegitimacy , insanity and other family secrets , all these have ways of re-emerging down the generations			0
@entity1 , who lives in @entity82 , questioned several relatives			0
' i became aware , through half - told stories , that there was a lot of tragedy connected to motherhood in my family history , ' she says			2
hence the story of @entity91 , her paternal great - grandmother and an @entity93 immigrant in @entity94 in the early 1900s			1
' an aunt told me that for the rest of her life , @entity91 was overwhelmed by the loss of her son , ' adds @entity1			2
' what echoed was the sense i had that birth was synonymous with death , and that if i let my body go , something terrible would happen , ' she explains			1
' it was as if i still held the horror of what had happened to @entity91 in my own body			0
' in 2010 , there was a surge of 40 per cent in the number of women seeking elective @entity114 because they had experienced trauma during previous births , prompting the @entity118 to introduce special birth trauma units and counselling services as well as funding research into why this is happening			1
during the bith @entity123 began to haemorrhage and spent five weeks drifting in and out of a coma ' it 's vital for the @entity118 to understand why so many new mothers are left traumatised , ' confirms dr @entity128 , head researcher at the @entity129 at @entity130			1
' this affects so many women , their future fertility and their psychological well - being			2
' holistic therapist @entity135 , and co-author of my book @entity139 , has experienced the phenomenon herself			2
@entity135 , 49 , lives in @entity141 with her three children , now aged 14 to 21			0
she gave birth to her first , @entity144 , at the age of 28			2
' i discovered my grandmother had given birth to my mother at 28 , and my mother to me at the same age , ' @entity135 says , ' and my daughter 's difficult birth seemed to reflect what my mother and grandmother went through			1
' @entity144 was born three weeks prematurely , just as her parents were moving house			1
@entity135 was in labour for 37 hours , and her daughter was so jaundiced she had to be kept in hospital for ten days			0
' at the time i felt totally alone and unsupported			0
i ended up with post-natal depression for six months			0
' when she discussed it with her mother , she found she had experienced similar feelings , though for different reasons			2
' my mother was in a foreign country , with few friends and no family			0
similarly , when my mother was born , my grandfather was in @entity173 on a sabbatical and my grandmother felt abandoned and lonely , ' she says			1
' i think that came through my mother to me			0
' of course , many people will argue that a woman 's experience of childbirth is largely down to @entity180 there are theories that the chemicals released by the mother during a traumatic birth can fundamentally alter an individual			1
such are the similarities between @entity189 's own birth and that of her son , that the 29 - year - old is convinced there is a link			1
@entity189 experienced a traumatic birth when her son @entity196 , now aged 5 , was born @entity123 had @entity197 , now five , at home in @entity199			1
during the birth she began to haemorrhage and spent five weeks drifting in and out of a coma after getting an infection			1
she says : ' i was born eight weeks premature and was taken away from my own mother for five weeks and put in an incubator			1
when i had @entity197 , i believe it was my own birth playing out again			2
' fear of giving birth is known as tokophobia after recovering , @entity123 began training as a birthing assistant , or doula , and attended many births			1
so when she became pregnant with daughter @entity214 in 2011 , she felt confident enough to proceed without consulting a midwife or doctor			0
after a short , easy labour , she gave birth last september in a birthing pool at home , with just her husband and a friend in attendance			2
however , when @entity123 registered the birth , a social services file was opened alerting the @entity118 to what they termed a ' concealed birth ' , prompting several visits to her home by suspicious health @entity231 later discovered this , too , had a precedent			0
for some women childbirth is truly terrifying she explains : ' i discovered my mother was born in secret			0
she was the result of an affair that my grandmother had , and although everyone pretended the baby belonged to my grandfather , my grandmother was shunned by society and her husband eventually kicked his wife and her daughter out			0
' all the women and childbirth practitioners we interviewed for our book said it was important to explore one 's family history around giving birth			1
' you can eat well , exercise and organise birth pools , ' says @entity123			0
' but if you do not work on clearing the past , you will experience what happened when you were born and your mother was born and so on			0
' @entity16 recalls how enlightening it was to unravel the mysteries of her own family line			1
' i explored all the stories and family myths i had inherited surrounding motherhood and childbirth , ' she says			0
' i found out about stillborn babies and children born in secret and surrendered for adoption , and women who struggled as i did to enjoy motherhood			0
' i began to understand how ideas of birth can be inherited , just as we inherit the colour of an eye or an aptitude for music			2
' while these latter traits can never be changed , there are many who desperately hope they can influence their birth experience , whether they believe it 's pre-destined or not			2

@entity16 experienced paralysing panic while giving birth to both daughters
great - grandmother 's son caught alight during grandmother 's birth and died
