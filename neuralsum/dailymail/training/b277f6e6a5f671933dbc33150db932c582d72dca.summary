by @entity1 reporter whether you prefer an early night and rise the crack of dawn - or stay up late and lie in half the day - could depend on your genes , according to new research			1
experts believe our genetic make - up determines exactly whether we are early or late risers - dubbed larks and owls			1
@entity11 dr @entity10 , of @entity12 , says understanding a person ’s chronotype - the time of day they function best - can help us live more healthily			1
whether you 're an early riser or a late sleeper may be down to genetics , experts say ( library image ) dr @entity10 told the @entity21 : ‘ whether we like it or not , our parents are telling us when to go to bed - based on the genes that they gave us			1
’ we all have internal circadian clocks - our master clock is made up of thousands of nerve cells in a wing - shaped structure located in the hypothalamus , at the base of the brain			0
the hypothalamus controls all kinds of bodily functions , from releasing hormones to regulating our temperature and water intake			0
this internal clock is reset every day by light			0
people who get up early are dubbed ' larks ' and late sleepers ' owls ' in the research by scientists at @entity12 you might expect that since the earth ’s day lasts 24 hours , everyone ’s clocks would run to a similar schedule			1
that ’s why there are larks and owls			1
families of extreme owls , with @entity58 , were found to have a different mutation in the same genes			1
@entity61 , a professor of pharmacology in @entity63 , said he is an extreme lark			0
‘ people i communicated with in @entity66 will always notice that they get emails from me very early in the morning			1
the other thing i like a lot which fits in with the early mornings is that i ’m a fairly serious bird watcher			2
‘ it ’s much easier for me than other people to get up and see the birds at dawn			0
’ he said his early starts run in the family			2
‘ my mother would always drag us out of bed at 4 in the morning to go on vacation , and my daughter works out early in the morning			2
’ dr @entity10 , who is studying families like @entity61 ’s that have @entity86 syndrome , said he started researching sleep patterns after his colleague dr @entity88 met a 69 - year - old who was worried about waking up very early			2
dr @entity10 said : ‘ we recognised this was a strong genetic trait			0
we found the mutated gene resided near the end of chromosome 2			0
’ @entity97 - @entity96 , @entity98 of @entity100 ’s @entity99 , said : ‘ if you have a fast clock you like to do things early , and if you have a slow clock you like to do things late			0

experts at @entity12 say sleeping *habits* are down to genetics
early risers dubbed ' larks ' and those who like to lie in ' owls '
