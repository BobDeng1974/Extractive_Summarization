by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 2:29 pm on 1st december 2011 militant union leaders failed in their campaign to bring @entity4 to its knees yesterday			1
@entity6 dismissed as a ‘ damp squib ’ a strike billed as the biggest for a generation			1
with picket lines sparsely populated , only a quarter of civil servants took action , the @entity10 suffered minimal disruption and @entity4 ’s borders operated more smoothly than normal			1
jobcentres remained open , courts were sitting , rubbish was collected and driving tests went ahead			2
packed : the combination of striking workers and children off school meant thousands descended on the @entity26 in @entity27 yesterday , triggering a pre-christmas mini sales boom extra time off : the @entity26 saw a rise in numbers that meant the 11,500 capacity car park struggled to cope in @entity36 , @entity35 's @entity34 shopping centre reported 15,000 extra visitors than on a normal weekday however , schools were severely affected , with almost two in three in @entity40 closing their doors , forcing many parents to take a day off work or make emergency childcare arrangements			1
@entity46 barons insisted the strike , over reforms to generous public sector pensions , had been a ‘ historic ’ success and claimed two million joined the action			2
that figure was rubbished by the @entity53 , which said it was a wild exaggeration and probably only half that			0
ministers appear emboldened by the failure of the action to cripple the country as unions had threatened			2
in some parts of the country , the combination of striking workers and parents trying to entertain their children on a day off from school triggered a pre-christmas mini sales boom			0
car parks were packed at shopping centres throughout the country			0
at the @entity26 , near @entity27 , there were long queues in the 11,500 capacity car park as families waited to go home			1
ignored : three @entity4 @entity77 workers picket outside their office , in @entity79 , but another seems oblivious to the action roadblock : unite members strike outside the @entity84 entrance to the @entity85 which was closed for the day two strikers wore their banners outside @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90 empty : chaos was threatened at @entity92 bur border controls at the airport actually ran more smoothly than usual two civilian police workers had travelled to the centre after an hour on the picket line			1
a male fingerprint officer , aged 42 , who would n’t give his name , said : ‘ we ’re here to do some @entity101 shopping as we ’re on strike			0
’ his female co-worker , 39 , added : ‘ i ca n’t believe it - it ’s full of strikers and people with kids			2
’ also there was a 26 - year - old teacher whose secondary school was closed because of the strike			0
clutching three bags , he said : ‘ we needed to make a stand but it ’s nice to have a day off to buy some presents			0
‘ i ’ve treated myself to some new jeans as well			0
’ a spokesperson for the centre said : ' @entity101 is well and truly underway at the @entity26 today , as people take advantage of a mid-week day off			1
' @entity27 has experienced a huge jump in footfall , compared to the same day last year			1
' in @entity131 ’s thronged @entity130 , sisters @entity125 , 27 , and @entity126 , 19 , who both work for @entity128 , were weighed down by ten shopping bags each – but denied accusations of hypocrisy			1
march : protesters make there way down the @entity136 from @entity137 during yesterday 's strike an elderly woman pickets outside the @entity140 of @entity141 miss @entity125 , who refused to cross a picket line for her job in the council ’s regeneration department , said : ‘ if people see this as an excuse for public - sector workers to have a day off and come shopping , what they have to remember is that we are losing a day ’s pay			1
so it is n’t a day off and there is a good reason for it			0
’ a spokesperson for the @entity130 said : ‘ it has been a very , very busy day today			2
’ a spokesman for @entity161 , north - west @entity90 , said : ' we ’ve had a lot of families and parents who have had to look after their kids because of the strike it ’s been a great day			0
' it ’s felt a bit like a busy weekend not a week day			0
' in the @entity170 , mr @entity6 launched an extraordinary attack on @entity173 leader @entity172 for expressing sympathy with the strike , describing him as ‘ irresponsible , left - wing and weak ’ and claiming the unions paid him to ask questions			1
amid increasing signs that senior @entity181 want to tighten union law , the prime minister vowed to end the £ 130million - a - year taxpayer funding for the salaries of union officials in the workplace			0
other cabinet ministers want to go further , and are proposing changes to introduce a new threshold for strike ballots to be legitimate and to make strikers give employers more notice of their intention to withdraw their labour			2
mr @entity6 said he thought the government had made a ‘ very reasonable , very fair offer to public - sector workers ’ , pointing out that a nurse earning £ 34,000 would currently retire on an annual pension of £ 17,000 but would get £ 22,000 after the government ’s reforms , though money would be saved through increased contributions and later retirement ages			2
‘ i do n’t want to see any strikes , but this government has to make responsible decisions , ’ he said			0
mr @entity172 said he had ‘ huge sympathy ’ for those whose lives were disrupted by the strike			1
but he said he was ‘ not going to condemn the dinner ladies , nurses , teachers who have made the decision to go on strike because they feel they have been put in an impossible position by a government that has refused to negotiate properly ’ .			0
