the @entity1 is using laws designed to catch terrorists and organised crime networks to track down people who dodge the licence fee , it emerged yesterday			1
the publicly - funded corporation uses the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , designed by the last @entity10 government to fight terrorism , to catch those who evade paying the £ 145.50 fee			1
now , however , its ability to use sweeping surveillance powers could be stopped by a new review announced yesterday by culture secretary @entity17			1
mr @entity17 's independent inquiry into tv licence fee enforcement will examine the corporation 's use of covert surveillance operations on those it thinks have not paid the obligatory licence fee			1
appearing before the @entity35 yesterday , mr @entity17 was asked whether he felt it was ' appropriate ' for the corporation to use @entity8 powers			1
he replied : ' this whole issue of people who are n't paying the licence fee , how do you go after them and get them to pay , needs to be looked at very carefully			1
' and that 's exactly why i set up this review , which is an independent review			1
' he said that the inquiry will be led by leading barrister @entity48 , and will conclude next june			0
mr @entity49 has previously advised the @entity50 on the cash for honours scandal , and acted for the @entity50 on the prosecution of radical @entity55 hate preacher @entity54 for murder and race - hate offences			0
the review 's primary purpose is to investigate whether evasion should be decriminalised following concern at the number of convictions			2
almost 200,000 people are prosecuted a year – one in nine of all lower court cases - and more than 50 people were sent to prison in 2012 - 2013 for failing to buy a tv licence			1
many get penalties of up to £ 1,000 and a criminal record			0
the @entity1 has been used anti-terror spying laws to catch licence fee dodgers , but maybe not for much longer mr @entity17 said : ' when the licence fee was put in place it was a long , long time ago and some people argued that you needed to have criminal sanctions because there is no way to cut off someone if they do n't pay their fee in the way you can cut off someone 's electricity supply			1
' but clearly times have changed			0
' technology has moved on			0
also , there is a question of fairness – 50 people went to jail for not paying their licence fee			1
i think this raises considerable concerns			0
' @entity101 mp @entity100 , who chairs the culture committee , said there were ' big question marks ' over the @entity1 's use of @entity8 powers			1
he added : ' the problem is , the @entity1 wo n't tell us how it is being used , or in what circumstances			2
that means we ca n't be sure it is being used properly			0
' this legislation was designed to fight terrorism and organised crime			1
i ca n't imagine it was intended for people who do n't pay their tv licence			1
' @entity119 , of the campaign group @entity120 , said : ' the public were told these powers were going to be used to catch terrorists and paedophiles , not to help the @entity1 to snoop on people who have n't paid the licence fee			1
' it is clear that the use of these powers has reached unacceptable levels			0
it is important that there is a wholesale review of how these [ powers ] are being used not just by police and intelligence services but also by organisations like the @entity1			2
' home secretary @entity138 recently ordered that the rules governing the use of @entity8 should be tightened so they are used only to investigate serious crimes			2
the @entity142 has come under fire for using the powers to access the phone logs of reporters on two newspapers to trace their sources			0
in 2012 , @entity120 discovered 345 councils had been authorised to use @entity8 9,607 times in just three years – the equivalent of around nine spying missions a day			2
seven public authorities , including the @entity1 , refused under the @entity154 to disclose why or how often they had used the powers			2
new @entity160 chairman @entity159 , pictured at a previous meeting , was accused of ' going native ' by @entity101 mp @entity163 after her initial report on the corporation described it in glowing terms at the time , the @entity1 said the reason for its secrecy was ' to ensure people without a valid tv licence do n't use this information to their advantage '			1
last night a @entity1 spokesman said : ' legislation explicitly grants the @entity1 the right to use these powers to detect unlicensed use of television receivers			2
' we 're regularly inspected by independent regulators and have always been open about using this power when there is no other option to help reduce evasion on behalf of the vast majority of the population who pay for their licence			0
' @entity8 , passed by @entity10 in 2000 ostensibly as an anti-terror measure , gives public authorities sweeping powers to snoop on the public			1
the most common use of the legislation is to demand phone companies hand over an individual 's communications data			0
this would include details of who a person called , when and for how long			0
however , the act can also be used to mount undercover surveillance operations – such as secretly following a person to see when they are at home			0
this could , in theory , be used to match the times when a tv is believed to have been in use			0
@entity159 , the new chairman of the @entity160 , the independent governing body of the @entity1 , was accused of ' going native ' after giving a glowing initial report into the corporation			2
many had hoped @entity216 , who had extensive private sector experience before joining the @entity160 , would bring a firmer approach to the corporation whose image had been tarnished by scandals including large pay - offs for departing executives			0
conservative mp @entity224 said he was ' alarmed ' by @entity216 not having identified a single weakness yet , and asked her ' have you gone native in record time ? ' she replied : ' absolutely not			0

@entity1 admits using @entity8 anti-terror legislation to find licence fee dodgers
law was *introduced* under @entity10 to combat terrorism and organised crime
but new review into tv licence fee enforcement may stop the @entity1 practice
@entity17 's independent review will examine ' *current* enforcement regime '
almost 200,000 people are prosecuted a year for *non-payment* , and 50 jailed
