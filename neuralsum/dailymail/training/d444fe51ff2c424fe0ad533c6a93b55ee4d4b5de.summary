thanks to an overwhelming response from well - wishers , they have now raised $ 154 , 500 ( around £ 80,000 ) dr @entity6 said : ' if it was n't for her [ the baby ] , we would do our best and let nature take its course			1

i 'm doing it mainly for @entity14 and my daughter now			2

@entity100 ( also known as @entity100 ) targets a protein that helps cancer cells develop a new blood supply			2
it blocks the protein and stops the cancer from developing new blood vessels			0
this reduces its supply of oxygen and nutrients so the tumour shrinks or stops growing			0
the drug is licensed to treat some types of cancer that have spread from where they first started ( advanced or metastatic cancers )			1
it may be used to treat an advanced type of lung cancer or advanced cancers of the bowel , breast or kidney			2

writing on the fundraising page to express her gratitude , mrs @entity97 said : ' the past 48 hours have been a whirlwind of love , grace and generosity , demonstrating the enormous power of a story , relationships and social media to rally around a cause			0
' @entity6 and i have been given more than we could ever have asked or imagined toward the cost of his treatment and the care of our baby			2
our target long exceeded , we just want to thank everyone so very much for their kindness			0
' to all those who gave , appealed and reposted on our behalf , often with words that brought tears to our eyes ... our hope is that we will have just a little while longer together and with our baby as a result of your generosity			0
