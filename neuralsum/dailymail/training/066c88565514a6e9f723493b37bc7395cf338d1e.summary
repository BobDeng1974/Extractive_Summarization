this kitten has been nicknamed ' @entity1 ' after being born with a deformity in her front paws that means she sits and walks on her hind legs like a squirrel			1
@entity8 , a five - month - old , suffers from a rare condition that means she has no bones after the elbow joint in her front legs so they are permanently bent inwards			1
she is unable to run like other felines and has no choice but to either waddle on her rear legs or slouch forward onto her crooked limbs			2
@entity8 's condition - radial hypoplasia - is believed to be the result of inbreeding among a group of unneutered cats kept in a house together			1
her mother , @entity36 , was taken to a cat rescue centre and gave birth to a litter of three kittens , but only @entity8 survived			2
staff at the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , took her to the vets who advised them to gently massage her twisted legs until she was old enough for an x-ray			0
@entity8 : her condition - radial hypoplasia - is believed to be the result of inbreeding among a group of unneutered cats kept in a house together @entity1 : @entity8 , the grey kitten , has been compared with a squirrel when she was nine - weeks - old a scan revealed that she had the deformity , and although it is not life threatening , it could mean she has medical problems in the future			1
pictures of @entity8 were posted on the rescue 's @entity65 page , and as a result she was adopted by @entity68 , 35 , who has another cat , honey , with a similar condition			1
@entity72 , founder of @entity43 , said : ' @entity8 's mum , @entity36 , was brought in to us when she was pregnant			2
' the owner did n't get the cats neutured and did n't let them outside , so the babies were inbred			0
she had three kittens , one was still born , another sadly died , but little @entity8 survived			2
' we could see from a very early age that there was a problem , she would try and run around and when she stopped she would sit up like a squirrel			0
' we nicknamed her " @entity1 " because she looks like a squirrel as it sits back on it 's hind legs and eats a nut			1
' we took her to the vets and they said to massage her legs until she was old enough for an x-ray but there was no improvement			0
' when she was about eight or nine weeks old we took her for a scan where we found out she had radial hypoplasia			0
' some people think cats who have deformities need to be put down but this is n't the case , we wanted her have a comfortable and happy life and she now does			0
' both @entity68 's cats walk on their back legs like humans or lean forward onto their elbows and when they are not moving they sit up in a way that has been compared to a squirrel or meerkat			1
rare condition : @entity8 's owners discovered she had the condition when she went for a scan aged nine weeks			1
she is being held here by @entity119 @entity68 , who is a support services officer in a mental health unit , from @entity121 , @entity122 , said : ' i was working in a veterinary practice when @entity70 was brought in and left in a box			0
' she was just three - weeks - old and as soon as i saw her i knew i wanted to look after her , so i began enquiring about her front legs and seeing if she needed an operation			2
' she had a heart murmur so any operation ran a risk , i sought advice from my vet , and also heard about a cat who had lived a normal life with the condition			0
friends : @entity8 ( front left ) and @entity68 's other cat honey ( back , and right ) who has a similar deformity ' i also set up a @entity65 page to seek advice and in the end i decided not to go ahead with the operation			1
' a friend sent me a link to little @entity8 and i messaged the rescue centre and said i would be more than happy to adopt her too			0
' she is getting on really well and both her and @entity70 have become firm friends and have regular check ups to monitor them and make sure there are no health complications			0
