@entity0 pictured here at the internment camp where he was held when @entity6 pilot @entity5 crashed his @entity7 into a peat bog in @entity9 during @entity10 , few thought it would ever be seen again			1
the pilot who bailed out immediately wanted to climb into the cockpit of another military aircraft and continue fighting for the allies			2
knowing that his fighter was doomed , the young @entity16 officer had radioed : ' i 'm going over the side ' before parachuting to safety moments before impact			0
but instead of fighting again the serviceman was interned in a camp - where captured @entity25 and @entity6 troops mixed freely with the @entity27 enemy			1
despite managing to escape @entity9 , neutral during the war , and make his way back to @entity25 , the 23 - year - old was sent back to the camp			1
fearing a diplomatic row , the @entity32 returned @entity0 to the most relaxed of ' prison ' camps in @entity9 where he was kept for a further two years			1
the pilot from @entity38 had been stripped of his @entity6 citizenship after agreeing to fight for the @entity25 because the @entity6 had not yet joined the war			1
now almost 70 years after the pilot from the 133 ' @entity42 crash - landed in the north of @entity9 in november 1941 , his crashed plane has been recovered			1
the @entity7 was the first of 20 made with a donation from a @entity48 millionaire called @entity49 who wanted to support the @entity50 in the @entity51 with a Â£ 100,000 donation			1
remarkably large parts of the plane have been recovered from the bog			2
six machine guns and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition were also discovered by archaeologists searching the @entity60 in @entity61			0
@entity62 lost his @entity6 citizenship in 1941 when he signed up to fight for the @entity16 the excavation was carried out as part of a @entity67 @entity9 programme			1
historian @entity68 said : ' the plane itself is obviously kind of wreckage and the big pieces survived			0
we 're expecting to find things like the engine and there still may be personal effects in the cockpit			0
' it 's just incredible because it 's just so wet here that the ground just sucked it up and the plane was able to burrow into it and it 's been preserved			0
' it 's in amazing condition , ' he told @entity90 radio			0
a team of @entity93 recruits at the @entity94 , just outside @entity95 , where @entity0 was held for two years during @entity10 historian @entity68 led the project to dig the @entity7 out of the peat bog almost 70 years after the pilot bailed out of the doomed plane mr @entity68 said mr @entity100 was forced to abandon his spitfire over the @entity102 when its engine overheated about 13 miles from his base at @entity105 , now @entity106 , in @entity9			1
aviation archeologist @entity107 told the @entity108 that it was highly significant that the doomed plane had been recovered			2
' the pilot was lucky to survive that day because if his engine had failed a few minutes earlier he would have ended up in the sea , ' he said			2
landing on neutral soil , the 23 - year - old pilot was interned at @entity115 detention camp in @entity116 for two years			1
with fishing trips , fox hunts and football matches it sounded almost like a holiday camp - and seemingly the ideal place to be holed up as war raged across the rest of @entity125			1
the guards were only issued with blank rounds , visitors were permitted and there were frequent excursions to nearby pubs			0
around 40 @entity16 pilots who crashed in @entity9 were held in the corrugated iron huts alongside the @entity27 enemy			2
the crew of destroyed u-boats and @entity138 planes also ended up at the camp			0
the warring nations even played football matches against each other - with the @entity27 defeating the largely @entity144 team 8 - 3 , in a precursor to their repeated post-war footballing triumphs over their @entity148 enemy			2
spitfires fly over @entity25 - the recovered fighter had been remarkably well preserved by the bog but although servicemen were free to come and go from the camp @entity0 , who died in 1994 , was determined to fight on			1
in december 1941 , just two weeks after his crash , the serviceman made his way into @entity95 before hopping onto a train to @entity159 which was @entity25 territory			1
as his doomed plane came down he parachuted out before watching it plunge into the ground half a mile away			0
although he made his way back to @entity105 , he was returned to the @entity93 camp where he spent a further two years before it was closed			2
belatedly he got his wish , and in 1943 he was allowed to return to frontline action as the tide of the war turned in the @entity50 direction			0
it is only because of the unusually soft ground that the crashed @entity171 could be recovered in the 70th year after the crash			0
the @entity173 said the six @entity175 machine guns and approximately 1,000 rounds of ammunition were discovered by a team of archaeologists from @entity180 buried up to 30 feet in the bog			0
' the six machine guns and ammunition have been removed by the bomb disposal team to a secure military location where they will be decommissioned and cleaned before being handed over to the @entity188 , ' a spokesman added			0
the plane will now be preserved and go on display at the @entity191 in @entity106 .			0
