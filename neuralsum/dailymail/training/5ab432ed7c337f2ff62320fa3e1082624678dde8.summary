by @entity0 published : 07:59 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 19:23 est , 30 july 2013 controversy : lord @entity2 of @entity3 said fracking could go ahead in the @entity5 because it was inhabitable a @entity7 peer provoked a storm of criticism yesterday by suggesting fracking should be concentrated in the @entity5 of @entity11 because it is ‘ desolate ’			1
lord @entity2 , the father - in - law of chancellor @entity12 , said ‘ beautiful rural areas ’ further south should be spared the disruption caused by the controversial method of shale gas extraction			1
the peer , who as @entity2 was energy secretary under @entity19 and long - serving mp for @entity3 in @entity21 , claimed that the @entity5 was so sparsely populated that fracking could take place without any impact on the environment or local people			1
his comments in the @entity28 drew gasps of astonishment – and immediate condemnation			1
archbishop of canterbury @entity32 tweeted : ‘ @entity5 very beautiful , rugged , welcoming , inspiring , historic , advancing , not “ desolate ” as was said in @entity28 today			1
’ @entity33 accused @entity2 , 77 , whose daughter @entity34 is married to the chancellor , of wishing to protect @entity7 heartlands in the @entity37 while condemning the @entity5 to shale gas drilling			1
the peer later apologised for ‘ any offence caused ’ but his comments are embarrassing for the conservatives , who must gain seats in the @entity5 to have any hope of winning the 2015 election			1
last night @entity47 distanced themselves from @entity2 , pointing out that he was no longer connected to the government after stepping down in april as @entity50 ’s adviser on energy			1
his intervention came as villagers entered the sixth day of protests against fracking in the @entity56 countryside			0
some 23 people have so far been arrested in @entity58 , which has been earmarked for exploratory drilling by fracking company @entity60			0
stand - off : there is a heavy police presence today escorting vehicles past protestors at a proposed fracking site in @entity58 , @entity56 police lines : officers have been forced to escort lorries on to the fracking site at @entity58 protest : opponents of fracking claim it can trigger earthquakes and risks polluting waterways forcibly removed : former page 3 model @entity78 was carried away from the scene where protestors were blocking a lorry at a proposed fracking site near @entity58 , @entity56 police outnumbered the campaigners yesterday morning , with officers forming a human shield to enable delivery lorries to enter the site unhindered by a group of 50 protesters who included @entity93 ’s ex-wife @entity92			2
fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel			1
lord @entity2 told the @entity28 that it would be a ‘ mistake to think of and discuss fracking in terms of the whole of the @entity107 in one go ’			1
‘ there obviously are , in beautiful rural areas , worries about not just the drilling and the fracking , which i think are exaggerated , but about the trucks , and the delivery , and the roads , and the disturbance , ’ he said			2
‘ and those are quite justified worries			0
‘ but there are large and uninhabited and desolate areas			0
certainly in part of the @entity5 where there ’s plenty of room for fracking , well away from anybody ’s residence , where we could conduct without any kind of threat to the rural environment			2
’ despite stunned exclamations from peers , lord @entity2 continued unperturbed , saying that a distinction ‘ should be made between one area and another , rather than lump them all together ’			1
@entity33 ’s @entity136 , former leader of @entity137 , said : ‘ @entity141 spoke of pre-war @entity142 as “ a far away country of which we know nothing ”			2
lord @entity2 clearly has a similar view on the @entity5 and his comments once again highlight the @entity47 ’ problem with the @entity5			1
’ while @entity146 is @entity11 ’s least densely populated county , the @entity5 , far from being desolate , contains a wealth of spectacular scenery including the north @entity149 , the @entity150 and a national park , as well as two @entity152 : @entity153 and @entity154			2
@entity155 , director of renewal , which campaigns to broaden the appeal of the @entity7 , said : ‘ the @entity5 boasts some of the finest landscapes in the country			1
i ’d be delighted to give @entity2 a tour			2
‘ the choice over where fracking should take place should be taken by local communities			0
’ @entity165 , of @entity166 , said : ‘ he ’s probably never been up here in his life			0
’ last night lord @entity2 was forced into a humiliating climbdown			1
in a statement he said : ‘ i apologise for any offence caused			0
i certainly did not intend to suggest that the @entity5 is desolate			2
‘ there are parts of the country that are less densely inhabited than others			0
that includes parts of the @entity5 but also other areas in the @entity180 as well			2
