by @entity0 published : 10:09 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 2 august 2013 a middle - class pensioner has taken squatting to new heights by ' occupying ' a public toilet block to prevent its closure			1
campaigner @entity5 , 67 , has taken up residence in one of the cubicles of @entity10 public loos in @entity11 with a sleeping bag , food and water			1
she is furious at plans by @entity11 to close several public toilets across the area			1
ms @entity5 believes it is a cost - cutting exercise which hits the most vulnerable in society such as the elderly and disabled			1
' the priorities are wrong nationally and locally , with huge capital budgets for massive projects that primarily serve vested interests			2
' i start with local toilets , which serve one of our most basic human needs , where closure hurts the most vulnerable , elderly , women , children and disabled people			1
' ms @entity5 has previously been a member of the @entity43 the @entity45 campaign which successfully fought off the closure of toilets near her home in @entity10 , @entity11			1
she set up an online petition to save toilets earmarked for closure , including @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity25			0
bedtime : @entity23 has taken her sleeping bag and other supplies she needs to make her toilet cubicle comfortable to sleep in upset : the 67 - year - old is unhappy that @entity11 has earmarked a number of public toilets for closure in order to save money armed with her camping equipment , she moved into @entity25 loos on wednesday - the day they were due to close - and intended to stay for three nights			1
but her one - woman protest has attracted so much local support that she has vowed to continue			0
a number of local residents have turned out to support her , waving banners reading ' @entity25 needs loos ' and ' refuse to lose our loos '			1
she said : ' i am occupying these toilets for three reasons			0
' there was some good campaigning by @entity25 people to keep the toilets open , with a petition of 97 signatures handed in and another petition of at least 50 signatures gathered , but many people in @entity25 still do not know our toilets are closing , and we need to know and mobilise			1
' the second reason is that although i have been campaigning to save the @entity10 toilets , people need all these facilities			0
' we are stronger if we work together , so this widens and intensifies the campaign			0
' the third reason is to put this in the context of cuts that are unnecessary , unreasonable and unwanted by people who can vote			0
' row : councillors have not been entirely sympathetic to her protest , asking her if who would be willing to clean and open them every day for free in an open letter to @entity109 deputy leader councillor @entity108 , the @entity43 the @entity45 campaign sets out the reasons for keeping the facilities open			1
it states that one in five people suffer with a variety of urinary or bowel problems who need convenient , accessible toilets , and that closing them would damage local shopping areas as people will stop using them			0
but councillor @entity108 was unsympathetic to the occupation , saying it was necessary to save £ 120,000 a year			0
he wrote on @entity123 : ' seriously , you are occupying some loos			2
they will start to smell after a few weeks			0
' if you fancy cleaning them , opening and locking up each day , that would be great			2
enjoy ! ' the petition is rather pointless			0
we have prioritised loos where people stay for longer periods of time such as play areas , those will be kept in better condition too moving forward			2
' i have a £ 120k saving that @entity109 require me to make on loos , i think that we have prioritised the right ones			2

@entity5 , 67 , is angry at *proposals* to shut loos across @entity11
pensioner has moved into a cubicle and sleeps on its *floor* in a sleeping bag
*decision* to shut them will hurt vulnerable who need them , she says
councillors have asked if she is willing to clean and open them each day
