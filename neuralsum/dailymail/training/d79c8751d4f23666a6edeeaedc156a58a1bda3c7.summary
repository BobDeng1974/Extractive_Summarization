@entity0 never dreamed he would earn a 50th one - day international cap eight years after his 49th , let alone that it would come with a country other than @entity5			1
yet @entity7 ’s new captain began another chapter in the most diverse of careers when he played for @entity10 in their first two official 50 - over internationals			1
@entity0 , 38 , has been involved with the country of his birth for three years and lined up against @entity15 last month in their first games since being given full one - day international status			1
former @entity5 wicket keeper @entity0 has taken up playing odis for birth country @entity10 @entity0 ( right ) was part of the @entity5 team that defeated @entity22 to win the 2005 ashes @entity0 plays a shot during @entity10 's @entity26 qualifier against @entity15 ‘ it ’s absolutely fantastic , ’ said the man who was @entity5 ’s wicketkeeper in the fabled 2005 @entity23 triumph			1
‘ when i started playing for @entity30 i never believed it would lead to my 50th cap but the improvement in their cricket has been dramatic			0
‘ most of the guys play professionally in @entity22 now and i thoroughly enjoy being a part of what they are doing			0
there is pressure to perform , without all the pressure that surrounds playing with @entity5			1
‘ i do n’t keep wicket , i play as a batsman and try to pass on my experience			0
the players are hugely proud and passionate but you can just get on with it without huge scrutiny and that ’s refreshing			0
’ it is the latest step in quite a journey for the son of a pair of @entity56 teachers who spent 10 years in @entity10 before settling in @entity22			2
@entity0 came to @entity57 to explore his roots but ended up forging a long and successful career with @entity60 that earned him 34 test caps with @entity5			1
most notably he was an integral part of @entity64 ’s side that thrillingly claimed the @entity23 and took the catch that clinched what has since been described as the greatest test of them all			2
the snaffling of @entity70 off @entity72 ’s bowling by @entity0 when all seemed lost for @entity5 , and the slow raising of @entity75 ’s crooked finger , earned the most extraordinary two - run victory at @entity77 and remains one of the iconic moments in @entity81 sporting history			1
@entity0 came to @entity5 and built an impressive county cricket career playing for @entity60 @entity5 players celebrate after taking the last @entity22 wicket during the second test at @entity77 @entity5 may have won the @entity23 three times since 2005 — and been thrashed 5 - 0 twice since then , too — but nothing can quite compare with the series in which @entity5 defeated the great @entity89 in their prime			1
‘ people still tell me that they watched that @entity77 game on tv from behind their sofa , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it was incredible to take the winning catch there and to put on runs with @entity100 at @entity101			0
‘ i scored 85 in that game and if i have one regret it ’s that i did n’t go on and make an @entity23 hundred			2
other than that i ’m extremely satisfied with what i did with @entity5			2
‘ it ’s amazing to think that @entity23 series was nearly 10 years ago and i know there are a few things being lined up for the anniversary			2
i will always look back and be hugely proud of what we achieved			0
’ now he not only has a new international challenge with @entity10 , but also a new one in the county game , having left @entity60 for @entity116			1
‘ i thought my career might be coming to an end and started to seriously consider umpiring , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but the chance has come up to lead @entity7 in four - day cricket and i ’ve jumped at it			2
i ’ve got to prove i can still do it and i know i will have to particularly work at the physical side of things because @entity126 put huge emphasis on that but it ’s very exciting to be captain of a young side			0
’ @entity0 and @entity100 celebrate after reclaiming a memorable ashes on home turf in 2005 ( @entity134 ) @entity0 , @entity135 , @entity64 , @entity136 and @entity100 celebrate victory @entity0 is looking forward to captaining @entity126 the end at @entity60 came after he lost his place last season to one of the domestic game ’s most exciting young talents in @entity144			1
‘ i ’m delighted for @entity144 and there are certainly no bad feelings on my part , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ he ’s always had huge potential but he went to @entity22 last winter , threw himself into improving and everything clicked for him			0
‘ he has incredible potential and i can see him playing @entity153 cricket in the near future because he is the sort of dynamic player @entity5 are crying out for			1
as well as batting and keeping i think he is the best fielder in the country and i could see him playing in an @entity5 side alongside @entity160			1
’ @entity144 , who was added to @entity5 ’s provisional @entity26 squad when @entity162 was forced to pull out , could even come up against @entity0 if @entity10 come through qualifying for the @entity163 in @entity164 in 2016			1
‘ the qualifiers are in @entity166 and @entity167 next july and i hope my @entity7 commitments allow me to be there , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i never made it to a @entity26 with @entity5 so that would be quite something			0
’ whatever happens it has been quite a career , considering professional cricket was the last thing on @entity0 ’s mind when he ventured to @entity56 from his adopted home in @entity178			0
‘ i did n’t play professional cricket until i was 24 so it ’s been quite a journey , ’ added @entity0			0
‘ i ’ve got a two - year contract at @entity7 which will take me up until i ’m 40 and i ’m quite proud of that			0
‘ my wife tells me that none of it would have happened if i had n’t met her soon after arriving here because i would probably have gone back to @entity22			0
she ’s probably right , too			0
