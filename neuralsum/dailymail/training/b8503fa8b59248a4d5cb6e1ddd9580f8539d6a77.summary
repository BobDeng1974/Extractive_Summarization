@entity0 is facing furious demands to axe a controversial drama that hijacks a real terrorist murder of a senior @entity5 mp for entertainment			1
the family of @entity8 are fighting to ban the fictional thriller , which uses genuine news footage of the car bomb that killed him in the @entity14 car park , from being aired tomorrow			1
producers of the drama @entity17 pretend that his 1979 death was perpetrated by a secret @entity20 cell , when in fact he was murdered by the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , an @entity24 splinter group			1
close : @entity25 with her friend and advisor @entity8 at a 1978 press conference slurs : @entity8 is shown drinking and plotting in @entity0 's @entity17 his devastated family – who were not consulted by the channel – last night said they were intending to take action after learning how the prime - time series had fictionalised the atrocity ‘ in the name of entertainment ’ as well as falsely depicting him as a debauched and conniving figure			1
the drama muddies the line between fact and fiction , drawing heavily on debunked conspiracy theories that mr @entity8 – a war hero who escaped @entity45 – was assassinated by the government			1
the programme includes genuine footage showing the blood - stained wreckage of mr @entity8 ’s car , paramedics racing to save his life and @entity25 ’s reaction to news of the murder of her close ally and confidant , lending the fiction a veneer of credibility			1
mr @entity8 ’s youngest son @entity61 , 60 , told @entity62 : ‘ i am upset and i would dearly like to protect my father ’s reputation from lies and fabrication			1
' it seems that when somebody dies , people can say whatever they like			2
we would love to stop it from airing			2
’ @entity73 – a close friend and colleague of @entity8 who himself survived an @entity24 bomb – said : ‘ to attack a man like that who is dead and can not defend himself is despicable			1
’ in the first episode of @entity17 ’s second series , which airs tomorrow at 10pm , mr @entity8 – played by @entity79 ’s @entity78 – is portrayed as a hard - drinking double - dealer who connives with spies			1
@entity85 red wine over lunch , he is seen striking a murky deal with the security services to bring down @entity89 ’s @entity46 by silencing a prominent @entity91 mp – by whatever means necessary			2
real murder : @entity8 's bomb - damaged car on the ramp of the @entity14 car park report : @entity98 front page of the attack in 1979 @entity61 , a @entity102 ’s underwriter who was 26 when his father was murdered , added : ‘ i do n’t know why @entity0 would want to make such sensationalist claims when they are just not true			1
' the suggestion that my father was a drinker is particularly upsetting and utterly dishonest			2
after his heart attack in 1959 , he gave up drinking altogether			0
we may well have to take action over this			0
’ @entity61 ’s brother @entity114 , 66 , branded the drama an ‘ utter travesty and a cynical , money - making exercise ’ , adding : ‘ who do these people think they are , reinventing history for the purpose of entertainment ? to show real - life footage of my father ’s death is in incredibly poor taste , real in - the - gutter stuff			1
‘ we will be sending a very terse message of disapproval to the head of @entity0			0
they did n’t even have the courtesy to contact us about this			0
that is the very least they should have done			0
‘ this is nothing more than propaganda			0
@entity0 is watched by people in their 20s and 30s			0
they will think this mock history is the truth			0
that is monstrous and wrong			2
’ @entity114 ’s wife @entity144 , 61 , added : ‘ this is appalling – we all want to get it stopped			0
my father - in - law was a dear and able man			0
he was not a drinker and he was most certainly not killed by @entity20			1
' we will do all that we can to shut this series down			0
frankly , it is disgusting that anyone would think that slurring a man ’s character and reputation in the so - called name of entertainment is remotely appropriate			0
’ a hero 's burial : @entity114 , left , and @entity159 grieve with their mother @entity160 at @entity8 's funeral in 1979 mr @entity8 ’s eldest child @entity163 , 70 , also called for the programme to be cancelled , saying : ‘ we are not happy at all and i would like to see it banned because i do n’t see any point in it			1
the man portrayed is not the man i knew			0
’ @entity171 , the secretary of the @entity172 , added : ‘ @entity0 has crossed the line			0
@entity8 was a war hero , the first @entity8 to get back from @entity45			1
he had a fine record			0
' i am very saddened to hear this drama is going out			2
it ’s terrible that a great man ’s name should be dragged through the mud			0
’ the script weaves conspiracy with real life			0
mr @entity8 , who was @entity184 at the time , was killed just two days after the vote of no confidence which brought down @entity89			1
in 2005 , @entity17 creator @entity188 wrote a stage play @entity190 , about a teenager in thrall to @entity193			1
but he is best known for writing @entity194 with comedian @entity195 and @entity197 sitcom pulling with @entity198 , who quipped of the show : ‘ there is n’t a moral centre because @entity188 and i do n’t have one			0
’ @entity188 himself admitted of @entity17 : ‘ i ’m capable of being a c * * * , a not very nice person			1
’ the vote would have made mr @entity8 northern ireland secretary			1
the @entity23 killed him because they believed he would have brought their ‘ armed struggle to its knees ’			1
but on screen , mr @entity8 is silenced by @entity209 , a fictional , secret clique within the intelligence community , to prevent him from revealing its existence			1
the drama also suggests that sir @entity215 – the @entity216 ambassador to the @entity217 who was shot dead by the @entity24 just a week before mr @entity8 ’s assassination – was killed by security services for the same reason			1
again , genuine news footage of the diplomat ’s killing is used , with a graphic shot of a pool of sir @entity215 ’s blood shown after an agent is told : ‘ deal with @entity215			0
’ @entity229 , 56 , the wife of sir @entity215 ’s son @entity230 , said : ‘ the family has been made aware of the programme but we do not wish to comment			2
’ the episode ends with an agent from the network , played by @entity238 ’s @entity237 , admitting responsibility for @entity241 ’s murder			0
perversely , the 27 - year - old actress has even suggested the fiction is , in fact , a ‘ history lesson ’			0
she said : ‘ the political intrigue , the way the @entity8 story is woven in , it ’s brilliant			1
‘ it was a real history lesson for me as well			0
i was embarrassed about how little i knew of the 1970s			0
’ claims that mr @entity8 was killed by the security services were first raised by @entity253 , an @entity254 journalist , who believes the politician was killed by @entity257 agents working with the @entity258 because he was about to expose corrupt , senior members of the intelligence community			1
propaganda : @entity17 star @entity237 says the untruths are ' a history lesson ' but @entity264 , a counter-terrorism expert , said : ‘ there ’s no evidence to support these spurious conspiracy theories			1
they were totally discredited at the time			0
‘ all right - minded people always realised it was just tittle - tattle			0
it is incredibly offensive to the family of @entity8 to give these claims oxygen again			1
’ a @entity0 spokesperson said : ‘ the drama series @entity17 is entirely fictional			1
' a conspiracy thriller about a fictional organization called @entity209 , @entity17 occasionally blends real moments in history with fictional storylines , and therefore some events and characters have been adapted for dramatic licence			1
' it was not our intention to cause offence and @entity17 does not suggest that any other real organisation was responsible for the death of @entity8			1
that period in history has been both widely reported and dramatized over the last 35 years and is the subject of many conspiracy theories			0
' @entity73 and his wife @entity293 narrowly avoided death when @entity296 ’s @entity295 was blown up by the @entity24 during the 1984 @entity5 conference , killing five and leaving @entity293 requiring a wheelchair			1
here he describes his ‘ disgust ’ over @entity0 using @entity8 ’s murder for entertainment			2
i struggle to find the words to describe the extent of my disgust at the piece of so - called television drama concerning my dear , late friend @entity8 , on @entity0			1
if reports that they are proposing to use real news footage of his cruel murder by @entity254 terrorists are accurate , it must surely mark a new low point in @entity216 broadcasting			2
it is a nauseating example of the victory of greed and sensationalism over respect for the dead , over the feelings of the loved ones of those who have died , and over that derided old - fashioned quality , decency			0
anger : lord and @entity329 i had the privilege of knowing @entity8 , a man who showed the kind of bravery and dedication to his country that is alien to broadcasters in cynical pursuit of titillation , higher ratings and money			2
in a bygone world , a man of @entity8 ’s honour would have challenged the film maker to a duel			2
sadly , @entity8 is not around to throw down the gauntlet			2
to trash his reputation in this way is bad enough , but to do it to a man who is dead and can not defend himself is despicable			0
i have a much better film idea for @entity0			0
it has all the drama and excitement they like			2
it is about the first @entity216 officer to escape @entity45 , who nearly starved to death on the way back to @entity216 as he avoided the @entity359 , but made it in one piece , who spent the rest of the war directing the operation that enabled other heroic pows to negotiate the same perilous route back home and was awarded the @entity369			2
a man who played an important role in the @entity372 of @entity374 war criminals , became an mp , survived a heart attack , was among a small band of far - sighted and self - effacing politicians who saw the remarkable talent of a grocer ’s daughter from @entity382 , helped her save the country and was rewarded for all this by being blown to bits in the @entity386 itself by terrorists			2
a film about this story was made many years ago , but a new one would be most welcome			0
there is only problem : every word is true , so i doubt @entity0 will be interested .			0

cruel tv drama says @entity25 confidant was drinker killed by @entity20 agents
however , family of @entity5 mp @entity8 say : ' it 's a monstrous travesty '
producers of @entity17 pretend that his 1979 death was perpetrated by @entity20
in reality , he was murdered by the @entity23 ( @entity23 )
