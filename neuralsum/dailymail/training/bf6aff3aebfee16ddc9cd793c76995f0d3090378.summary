a spacecraft called @entity1 launched by @entity2 to map the stars in the @entity4 could be repurposed to find planets in the galaxy , say scientists			1
they say it could be used to find 70,000 worlds outside the solar system , including many that have previously been difficult to find			2
this would include huge @entity15 - sized worlds around dim stars - but might not include @entity18 - like habitable worlds			1
researchers from @entity20 in @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 say @entity1 ( illustration shown ) could find thousands of planets during its mission			1
primary goal of the spacecraft is to map one billion stars in the @entity4			1
but a ' by - product ' could also be the discovery of planets researchers from @entity20 in @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 calculated that the observational satellite @entity1 could detect as many as 21,000 exoplanets during its five - year mission if extended to 10 years , @entity1 could detect as many as 70,000 exoplanets , the researchers report			1
exoplanets will be an important ' by - product ' of @entity1 's mission , first author dr @entity41 of @entity20 said			1
built and operated by @entity2 and launched in december 2013 , @entity1 will capture the motion , physical characteristics and distance from @entity18 - and one another - of roughly one billion objects , mostly stars , in the @entity4 galaxy with unprecedented precision			1
@entity1 â€™s goal is to create the most accurate map yet of the @entity4			2
it will make precise measurements of the positions and motions of about one per cent of the total population of roughly 100 billion stars in our home @entity57 to help answer questions about its origin and evolution			2
repeatedly scanning the sky , @entity1 will observe each of its billion stars an average of 70 times each over five years			1
in addition to positions and motions , @entity1 will also measure key physical properties of each star , including its brightness , temperature and chemical composition			0
eventually , the @entity1 data archive will exceed a million @entity78 , equivalent to about 200,000 dvds of data			0
the presence of an exoplanet will be determined by how its star ' wobbles ' as a result of the planet 's orbit around it			0
more important than the numbers of predicted discoveries are the kinds of planets that the researchers expect @entity1 to detect , many of which - such as planets with multi-year orbits that pass directly , or transit , in front of their star as seen from @entity18 - are currently difficult to find			2
the satellite 's instruments could reveal objects that are considered rare in the @entity4 , such as an estimated 25 to 50 @entity15 - sized planets that orbit faint , low - mass stars known as red dwarfs			1
unique planets and systems - such as planets that orbit in the opposite direction of their companions - can inspire years of research according to dr @entity41			0
' it 's not just about the numbers			0
each of these planets will be conveying some very specific details , and many will be highly interesting in their own way , ' dr @entity41 said			0
one of the main objectives of the @entity1 mission is to establish the currently uncertain distance from @entity18 to various stars , which would allow a much better understanding of the properties of the stars and the planets orbiting them			2
this image shows the distances from @entity18 ( centre ) to the stars ( black dots ) of some exoplanets the kinds of planets that the researchers expect @entity1 to detect would include planets with multi-year orbits and others that are more difficult to detect via other methods			2
this would include @entity15 - sized worlds orbiting dim stars , but is unlikely to include many @entity18 - like planets ( @entity18 - like @entity147 illustration shown ) ' if you look at the planets that have been discovered until now , they occupy very specific regions of discovery space			1
' @entity1 will not only discover a whole list of planets , but in an area that has not been thoroughly explored so far			0
' ultimately , a comprehensive census allows scientists to more accurately determine how many planets and planetary systems exist , the detailed properties of those planets , and how they are positioned throughout the galaxy			0
' our assessment will help prepare exoplanet researchers for what to expect from @entity1 , ' dr @entity41 added			0
' we 're going to be adding potentially 20,000 new planets in a completely new area of discovery space			0
it 's anyone 's guess how the field will develop as a result			0
' @entity20 and @entity22 researchers project that the recently launched @entity177 satellite @entity1 could discover tens of thousands of planets during its five - year mission			1
in this image , the colored portions indicate the number of observations @entity1 would make of a particular part of the sky during its mission			0

researchers from @entity20 in @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 say @entity1 could find thousands of planets during its mission
primary goal of the spacecraft is to map one billion stars in the @entity4
but a ' by - product ' could also be the discovery of planets
in five years it could find 21,000 and in ten it could find 70,000
these would be planets that are usually hard to find by other methods
would include @entity15 - sized stars orbiting around dim stars
