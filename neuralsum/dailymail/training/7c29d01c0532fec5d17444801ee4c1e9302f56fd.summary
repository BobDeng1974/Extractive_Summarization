if sending rovers to @entity2 was n't enough , @entity0 now wants to send submarines to @entity4			2
the space agency has outlined plans to launch the huge structure to @entity9 's largest moon by 2040			1
@entity4 is unique in the outer solar system in that it is the only one of the bodies outside the @entity13 with liquid lakes and seas on its surface			2
the space agency has outlined plans to launch the huge structure to @entity9 's largest moon by 2040			1
pictured is an illustration of what the submarine could look like the @entity28 seas , however , are seas of liquid hydrocarbons – and astronomers now what to find out what lies beneath			1
specifically , they want to send a submarine to @entity4 's largest northern sea , @entity35			1
sprawling over 154,000 square miles ( 400,000 square km ) , and around 300 metres ( 1,000 feet ) deep , @entity35 is comparable in size to the @entity37 in @entity38			1
@entity0 's conceptual @entity4 submarine would weigh about one tonne ( 2,200 lb ) , and would use conventional electric propulsion over a 90 - day mission			1
@entity0 's @entity4 submarine would weigh about one tonne ( 2,200 lb ) , and would use conventional electric propulsion over a 90 - day mission sprawling over 154,000 square miles ( 400,000 square km ) , and around 300 metres ( 1,000 feet ) deep , @entity35 is comparable in size to the @entity37 in @entity38			1
@entity4 's atmosphere is largely made up of nitrogen and methane at a pressure one and half times that of @entity13 's , and with a temperature of @entity49 ( -179 ° c ) @entity0 says it plans to send the submarine to @entity4 using a winged spacecraft similar to @entity54 @entity53 x- 37			1
the craft would survive hypersonic entry into moon ' atmosphere , release the submarine , while its sinks to the bottom of the alien ocean			1
@entity4 's atmosphere is largely made up of nitrogen and methane at a pressure one and half times that of @entity13 's , and with a temperature of -290 ° f ( -179 ° c )			1
the space agency said the submarine would be driven by a @entity69 generator that would propel the craft and also prevent it from freezing			1
' the vehicle would observe – and perhaps ultimately exploit - tidal currents in the sea , which follow a cycle once per @entity4 day , or 16 @entity13 days , ' the researchers write in the design proposal			2
@entity0 said the submarine would be driven by a radiothermal @entity69 generator that would propel the craft and also prevent it from freezing @entity0 says it plans to send the submarine to @entity4 using a winged @entity82 craft would survive hypersonic entry into moon ' atmosphere , release the submarine ( right ) , while its sinks to the bottom of the alien @entity35 waters ( left ) overall , scientists estimate the boat will be able to travel at one metre per second ( 3.6 km / h , 2.2 mph )			1
if @entity35 is as deep as estimated , it could cause the proposed nitrogen ballast tanks to could condense into a liquid , making the craft sink			1
@entity0 has planned for this , and says a piston would enable liquid to pass liquid in and out , rather than simply relying air pressure			0
the mission would primarily look for traces of compounds that could give scientists a better understanding of how life began on @entity13			1
' we will investigate a full spectrum of oceanographic phenomena : chemical composition of the liquid , surface and subsurface currents , mixing and layering in the ' water ' column , tides , wind and waves , bathymetry , and bottom features and composition , ' said @entity0			0
' measurements of all these aspects of @entity4 's hydrocarbon ocean environment can only be made through focused in situ exploration with a well - instrumented craft			2
the design was developed for the @entity126 , by @entity128 ’s @entity127			0
the design was developed for the @entity126 , by @entity128 ’s @entity127			0
other proposals include : @entity131 ( @entity132 ) a propellant-less propulsion concept for deep space missions			0
herts is like an electric solar sail - it is an array of wires extending out up to 20 miles ( 30km ) from a rotating spacecraft that would gather energy from the sun. it would be capable of reaching speeds more than 430 miles ( 700km ) per second - and at top speed could travel from the sun to @entity146 in a year			2
@entity148 method for working out the gravity and mass of small solar system bodies ( such as asteroids and comets ) using a swarm of small , low - cost probes ( illustration below )			0
the @entity157 : ultra-high @entity158 at @entity160 giant disc that could boost the viewing power of space telescopes by up to a factor of 1,000			0
exploration architecture with @entity165 and in - situ @entity167 - on - a - chip systems , @entity169 , would be deployed on other planets or moons such as @entity172 to perform science at reduced time and risk ( illustration to the right )			0
@entity179 & @entity180 device to be used on manned spacecraft that could turn light from the sun into oxygen			0
wrangler : capture and @entity188 nanosatellite - scale sub-satellite , called the @entity189 grapple to @entity190 ( @entity185 ) system , will capture and de-spin a space object such as an asteroid using a large ‘ net ’ , in tandem with a tether deployer and winch mechanism			0
@entity197 a small rotorcraft weighing under 10kg ( 22lbs ) , not too dissimilar to small portable quadracopter drones on @entity13 , that would be deployed on @entity4 by a balloon to acquire close - up , high resolution imagery and mapping data of the surface			0
using the @entity205 in the @entity206 to @entity208 method to measure the ice depth on outer planet moons such as @entity172 , @entity211 and @entity212 using experimental techniques adapted from high - energy physics ( illustration below )			0
periscope : @entity216 proposed method to map subsurface structure on the moon using a ‘ seeing - around - the - corner ’ imaging technique adapted from periscopes			0
@entity223 device for studying the survival of terrestrial life forms on the surface of @entity2			2
it would take life from @entity13 and see if it can live on the red planet as a precursor to one day terraforming @entity2			2
@entity232 : harvesting @entity233 from @entity234 to enable fast and @entity235 tethered spacecraft that hitches rides on comets to tour the solar system			0
this would be done by firing a ‘ harpoon ’ with a tether attached that would reel the spacecraft in , like a sort of cosmic fishing rod ( illustration below ) .			0

submarine will head to the largest northern sea , *dubbed* @entity35 , on @entity9 's biggest satellite
it would weigh around one tonne ( 2,200 lb ) and travel at one metre per second ( 3.6 km / h , 2.2 mph )
with sea temperature of -290 ° f ( -179 ° c ) , a radiothermal @entity257 generator will prevent it from freezing
@entity261 will look for traces of compounds that could give a better understanding of how life began
