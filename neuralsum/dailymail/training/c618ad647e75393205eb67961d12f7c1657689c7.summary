veteran war correspondent @entity0 inserted a clause into her will expressly designed to stop her former husband benefiting from her £ 1.1 million estate , @entity5 has learned			1
journalist and author @entity6 was ‘ mystified and upset ’ last night to find she had gone to such lengths			1
friends were equally baffled as the pair were apparently on good terms			1
@entity6 said he would never have challenged the will , nor did he expect to inherit any part of 56 - year - old @entity15 ’s estate			1
indeed , having remarried two years before the document was drawn up , he would have been legally unable to do so			2
fiery : @entity0 , left , may have been upset with her former husband @entity6 , right , when she wrote the will , say friends both he and @entity15 had remarried since their divorce nearly 20 years ago , but had apparently remained good friends until she was killed by @entity25 army shelling in the besieged city of @entity27 last february , while on assignment for @entity29			1
despite their closeness , however , she went out of her way to specify that he should not be among the beneficiaries of her will			2
the document , drawn up in 2010 , stated : ‘ i wish to make it known that @entity6 , my former spouse , is deliberately not named in my last will and testament			1
i do not wish him to inherit from it , and i make this clause expressly known should he attempt to contest it			2
’ a legal source confirmed that under the @entity43 , former spouses or civil partners can contest a will only if they have not themselves remarried			2
shocked @entity6 , 60 , said last night : ‘ i did n’t know what was in the will and it ’s rather upsetting to hear			1
’ ms @entity0 gives an address at @entity48 in november 2010 , saying : ' we always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story ' he insisted he never had any intention of contesting the will , adding : ‘ nothing could be further from my mind			1
i do n’t know what is behind it			0
we were on good terms and it ’s a complete mystery to me			0
’ the pair married in 1989 but had a tempestuous relationship and divorced in the early nineties			1
@entity63 - born @entity15 ’s second marriage , in 1996 to a @entity66 journalist , was even briefer			0
one old friend of @entity15 was last night equally baffled by the will ’s contents , but suggested the famously fiery journalist might have been temporarily upset with @entity6 when she wrote it			1
‘ as far as i know they were on pretty good terms when she died , ’ said the friend , who declined to be named			0
‘ i ’m sure there was no deep animosity between them			0
‘ more likely is that she was miffed at something he ’d said or written at the time she drew up the will , and in a fit of pique just decided to add a clause which said “ * * * * you , @entity6 ! ” and probably would have forgotten about it the following day			1
‘ it ’s a shame , really , because few people were there for her as much as @entity6 – he may well have saved her life in @entity90			1
’ after their divorce , @entity15 and @entity6 were reunited in 2000 in the most dramatic fashion when she was reporting on the war between @entity90 and @entity94			1
foreign correspondent @entity0 was killed by a @entity25 shell in the besieged city of @entity27 last year she became trapped with rebel fighters as the @entity94 surrounded their position , leaving only a treacherous 12,000ft mountain pass to @entity100 as their escape			1
in an eight - day midwinter journey , she waded through chest - high snow and braved altitude sickness , hunger and exposure			0
@entity6 , also a foreign correspondent , heard of her predicament and set off from @entity109 to the @entity100 capital , @entity111			2
there , together with her colleague @entity112 , he helped to organise a helicopter from the @entity115 to pluck her off the mountainside to safety			0
as @entity15 wrote : ‘ i was never happier to have an @entity63 passport			0
’ similarly , in 2001 , when she was badly injured and lost an eye from a grenade explosion in @entity122 , it was @entity6 she turned to , describing him as her ‘ nurse ’			2
@entity6 is now a successful author of books such as @entity125 , about the @entity127 pilots of @entity128 , and @entity129 , which both chart the @entity132 ’s bloody campaign in @entity133			2
in 2008 he married writer @entity134 and they live in @entity136 with their young daughter			0
he paid fulsome tribute to @entity15 after she and @entity140 photographer @entity139 were killed by @entity25 forces at a makeshift press centre in @entity27			0
it was believed they were deliberately targeted			0
probate records disclose that @entity15 left £ 1,228,403 , reduced after liabilities to a net estate of £ 1,140,470			0
the will left the bulk of her estate to a niece , two nephews , a sister and a brother			0
but she also left £ 100,000 to her close friend @entity156 , and a painting of a boat to her partner in recent years , businessman @entity160			0
her final request was that she should be cremated and her ashes scattered on the @entity163 .			0

@entity6 insisted he had no intention of contesting the will
the pair split in early @entity170 and had both remarried
friends of @entity0 say she was probably upset with him at the time
