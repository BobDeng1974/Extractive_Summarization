making her comeback : @entity2 yesterday publicly announced her return to @entity4 she left @entity4 behind four years ago , all dimples and optimism , believing she was about to conquer @entity7 and launch an international career			1
now @entity2 is – somewhat embarrassingly – right back at square one			2
she is returning to @entity11 ’s saturday night series , playing the adoring foil to mogul @entity13 – a man who , until fairly recently , she heartily despised			1
@entity13 desperately hopes @entity2 will help revitalise the flagging show			1
her last appearance , in 2010 , was watched by 17.7million viewers , while the most recent series of @entity4 , the tenth , had a peak audience of 11.5million			1
however , while her return will undoubtedly give the talent contest a fillip when the next series begins later this year , whether @entity2 can effect a long - term boost is very much open to question			1
professionally , she is in the doldrums			2
she may have a fortune of around £ 20million , but her pop career is fading			1
she hired eccentric @entity31 star @entity30 against all advice as her manager , and then had to fire him			1
her @entity7 tv experiment in 2011 was a disaster – she lasted only two days of filming on @entity37			1
her @entity39 accent baffled viewers , who failed to warm to her			2
on a personal level , she remains painfully single – posting teenager - ish outpourings of angst on her @entity45 account only last week			1
‘ do n’t believe the things you tell yourself so late at night			2
you are your own worst enemy ! ’ she wrote			2
she also added a picture of herself looking tearful while wearing a baseball cap			2
the picture was captioned ‘ not today ’ and featured some sad - faced ‘ emoticon ’ symbols			2
friends say she is anguished because her best friend , former bandmate @entity55 , is pregnant while her own dream of motherhood remains unfulfilled			0
and despite her often - trumpeted status as the nation ’s sweetheart , she has made blunders time and again			2
take her bid to be ‘ gorgeous and free ’ in style like her heroine @entity64 , the chart - topping @entity65 superstar with the racy reputation			1
it resulted in a shockingly nasty rose tattoo all over @entity2 ’s previously perfect derriere			0
it was said that beauty giant @entity71 was thinking of dropping her from her big - money contract last year because they were so annoyed by it			1
so what is the truth behind @entity2 ’s re-emergence ? presumably rather a lot of humble pie has been eaten			0
after all , when she was sacked from @entity37 in 2011 , she sent @entity13 the following text message : ‘ f * * * you			1
f * * * @entity83			0
f * * * @entity82 ’s @entity81			0
f * * * the orange and purple outfit			0
f * * * big hair			0
f * * * the @entity87 @entity4			0
f * * * you all			0
’ in her 2012 autobiography @entity2 : my story , she painted a very unflattering picture of @entity13			1
in one of their earliest conversations , she said , @entity13 spent the whole time looking over her shoulder because he could see his reflection in a mirrored building opposite			1
she claimed that , while sacking her from @entity37 , he offered her the post of head judge on the @entity87 version , even though he had already given it to @entity103			0
she posted this photo on @entity45 yesterday to break the news , adding : ' guess what ! !			2
. ? ? i 'm @entity107 ! ! ! ! ' delighted : @entity13 gave a thumbs up to crowds at a press conference at @entity111 's @entity112 @entity13 has always been a fan , despite @entity2 's unflattering portrait of him in her 2012 autobiography he then allegedly offered to sack either @entity115 or @entity116 to make way for her , and said she could choose which one should go			1
it seemed that there was n’t much love lost between them			0
however , despite the success of her single @entity125 , released in june 2012 from the album @entity127 , it has become obvious to @entity2 that her career without @entity13 does n’t amount to much			1
a @entity129 had just a fraction of the sales of the previous two albums , and industry insiders say the next one , due out this summer , will make or break her career			1
@entity30 had promised that he would help her conquer the @entity7 market and said that there would be duets with artists such as @entity64			1
these did n’t materialise , and @entity2 did n’t get a @entity7 recording contract either			1
late last year , she cut the cord with him			2
@entity143 , the manufactured pop band which took @entity2 from a council estate in @entity146 , @entity147 , to stardom , reunited for a farewell tour last spring but are decisively apart now			1
in october , @entity2 announced that she had signed with @entity150 – which also looks after @entity4 alumni such as @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			0
( she had been suing @entity160 productions , the makers of @entity37 , for £ 1.4million of lost earnings			0
the lawsuit was settled to the satisfaction of both parties in november			0
) @entity13 is hoping @entity2 's return will bring the ratings back to their chart - topping high			1
there were 17.7m viewers when she last appeared on the panel			0
but the most recent series had a peak of 11.5m the pair were known for their flirtatiousness			0
he would peak down her dress and she would do bunny ears she will earn a reported £ 1.5m on the show , and joked that she only returned to stop @entity13 's begging it was clear that @entity2 was turning to @entity13 again – and the combination of mass exposure and well - funded marketing which he offers via his tv shows			1
indeed , it was @entity150 which apparently came up with a three - year plan to try to extend her life as a celebrity ( she will be 31 this summer )			1
being a part of @entity4 – just for one year – was a key part of trying to get the public to engage with her again			2
despite the falling out , @entity13 has always been a fan			1
he once told her : ‘ if i knew what made you so special , i would literally bottle it and sell it			0
’ he had apologised to her over and over again for the sacking , and she has finally been persuaded to come back on board			0
when asked why she had agreed to return , she joked : ‘ i mean there ’s only so much begging one can take			0
it ’s not nice to see a grown man cry			0
‘ if you had asked me the previous two years i would have said “ absolutely not ”			2
this year it just feels right			2
i always go for my gut instinct			0
we had a hit show the last time i was on it			0
i ’m really excited to be on it again			0
’ of course it will be financially worth her while – she is being paid a reported £ 1.5million – but @entity13 also promised her it would be ‘ fun ’			1
talking about their on - screen reunion yesterday , @entity13 said : ‘ it took me 2,000 calls , it ’s not bad			1
i know it sounds corny , but it is nice to work with people i like			0
‘ i know we had a massive fallout but i do consider @entity2 to be a friend			0
i trust her and she is loyal			0
we can pick up where we left off			2
’ viewers can expect the tight - knit duo to carry on where they left off as @entity13 says she is a genuine friend @entity2 's pop career is fading , and she is still getting over her broken marriage , so this should be a boost @entity13 is returning to the show as well , and believes that the public will be intrigued to see the pair ’s flirtatious best - of - ‘ frenemies ’ relationship on screen again			1
that relationship was , admittedly , conducted on a puerile level			0
@entity13 would ostentatiously peek down @entity2 ’s dress and make a schoolboyish comment one day , she would make ‘ bunny ears ’ above his head the next – but the audience did seem to enjoy it			1
people who know @entity2 say that she could use some fun in her life			0
they suggest that she is still getting over the messy collapse of her marriage to footballer @entity250 , who was caught out ‘ sexting ’ a blonde stranger in february 2010 , only four years after their wedding			1
a subsequent romance with @entity7 dancer @entity254 failed to last			1
@entity2 now lives in a rented flat in north @entity111 , which she shares for much of the time with her brother @entity257 and mother @entity258			0
though she has posted a series of downright miserable messages on @entity262 and @entity45 , there have also been signs that , after a difficult few years , she has recovered some of her pugnacity			2
as she recently tweeted : ‘ before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self esteem first make sure you are not in fact surrounded by * * * * holes			0
’ what she will think of her famous colleagues by the time the next series of @entity4 ends remains to be seen .			0

@entity143 star left 4 years ago to break @entity7 , *blasting* @entity13 in her book
@entity30 promised duet with @entity64 and record deal but all fell through
now career fading - and x factor viewing figures dropped by *6m* since 2010
@entity13 and @entity250 hope the move will give both a boost this year
