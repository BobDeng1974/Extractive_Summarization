by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 06:34 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 28 march 2013 sir @entity2 is likely to have been sacked had he not stood down in october last year a former chief constable who oversaw the aftermath of the @entity7 disaster is likely to have been sacked if he was still a serving officer , it has been found			1
sir @entity2 tried to influence public perception as the @entity9 was deciding whether to refer him to the @entity10 following the @entity12 report last year , the @entity10 has concluded			1
it said : ' while it was evident sir @entity2 made no attempt to prevent the referral happening , the @entity10 investigation concluded that he attempted to manipulate the public perception of the referral process for his own self - interest			1
' the commission said its finding would justify sir @entity2 's dismissal if he was still a serving chief constable			1
but lawyers for the former @entity25 chief constable said today that the way the @entity10 conducted its inquiry ' calls into question the fairness of such a process '			2
the @entity10 investigated his actions in relation to the process by which complaints about his involvement in the aftermath of the @entity7 disaster were referred to the commission			2
the former chief , who has always denied any wrongdoing , resigned from his post in @entity25 last year			0
the @entity10 said in a statement today : ' the @entity10 concluded sir @entity2 had a case to answer for discreditable conduct and abuse of authority , breaches which , if proven in a disciplinary hearing , would amount to gross misconduct as they would justify dismissal			1
' however , as sir @entity2 left the police service in october 2012 he can not face a disciplinary hearing in which the evidence could be tested			1
' instead , the @entity10 is publishing its findings for the public to judge			0
' an investigation into sir @entity2 's conduct in the period following the 1989 disaster that claimed the lives of 96 people , when he was involved in @entity63 's inquiry into what happened , is ongoing			1
@entity10 deputy chair @entity65 said : ' the @entity7 disaster and its aftermath have become synonymous in the public consciousness with allegations of police attempts to cover up the truth , manipulate messages and deflect blame			2
' sir @entity2 is facing investigation in relation to allegations that he played a key part in this			2
complaints were sent to the @entity10 about his involvement in the aftermath of the @entity7 disaster ' we do not pre-judge the findings of that investigation			0
however , given the effect that those allegations have had on the public perception of him and policing generally , his attempts to manipulate and manage the perception of the referral of complaints about him , for his own self - interest , is particularly concerning			0
' it is also conduct that falls far short of what should be expected of any chief constable			0
' it was the @entity10 's view at the start of the investigation , as it was the view of his @entity9 , that sir @entity2 's actions , if proven , fell so far short of what is expected of a chief constable that dismissal would be justified			1
' the evidence uncovered during the investigation supports that view			0
while we can not bring this case to misconduct proceedings , we can publish the evidence and our conclusions , so that the public can judge for themselves			0
@entity10 deputy chair @entity65 said the aftermath of @entity7 had become synonymous with police attempts to cover up the truth , manipulate messages and defect blame ' this case should also serve as a salutary reminder to chief officers everywhere of how much public confidence in policing is damaged when the conduct of leaders is called into question			2
' sir @entity2 was a chief inspector with @entity63 at the time of the disaster			2
he attended the match at @entity136 's ground as a spectator but , after the tragedy , he was involved in the subsequent force investigation			0
his involvement in that inquiry has provoked waves of allegations and criticism from the families of those who died and has dogged his career , which included a stint as the chief constable of @entity150			0
following the publication of the @entity152 last year , sir @entity2 was referred to the @entity10 over claims that he gave misleading information in the wake of the tragedy and that he tried to influence @entity158 's decision - making process in relation to the referral			1
he resigned as the @entity25 chief in october , saying it was because the controversy had become a ' distraction to policing in @entity25 '			0
in a statement issued through the police authority at the time , sir @entity2 said he had never blamed the fans for the tragedy			1
and he dismissed a claim first highlighted by @entity150 mp @entity172 that he had once bragged to a fellow student in a pub about ' concocting ' the police version of events , describing the allegation as ' both incredible and wrong '			0
at the time of his resignation , sir @entity2 said the police authority and some of the candidates in the forthcoming police and crime commissioner elections made it clear that they wanted him to go			1
last month , home secretary @entity183 promised a crackdown on police who avoid disciplinary hearings because they resign or retire			0
sir @entity2 was a chief inspector with @entity63 at the time of the disaster and was at the match as a spectator on the day mrs may said proposed reforms would mean such proceedings will be completed regardless of the officer 's departure			1
in today 's full report , the @entity10 said : ' a finding that sir @entity2 has a case to answer is not a finding that he is guilty			1
' such a finding could only follow a formal misconduct hearing in which the evidence would be tested and , as sir @entity2 is no longer a police officer , such a hearing can not be held			2
' i am very mindful of the public concerns around officers resigning or retiring while under investigation , thereby escaping a misconduct sanction			0
' i do find it unacceptable that officers take that option rather than facing up to the case against them			0
' on 23 october 2012 sir @entity2 announced his intention to retire with immediate effect			2
this decision was not under investigation , but it seems that , in this case , sir @entity2 's departure was a direct result of actions by the @entity9			1
' it is clear from the evidence provided by both sir @entity2 and the chief executive of the authority that , in fact , the police authority required sir @entity2 to resign on 24 october 2012 , and it was not sir @entity2 's wish to go at this time			1
' according to today 's report , the key issue was sir @entity2 's desire to refer himself to the @entity10 and , therefore , control the process			1
sir @entity2 ( pictured in 2008 ) today questioned the ' fairness ' of the @entity10 report the report concluded : ' it is concerning that his first thoughts appear to have been to protect his own position			1
' on the balance of probabilities it is considered that the evidence indicates that sir @entity2 was trying to influence the decision - making of the @entity9 because he wanted the public to believe that he had referred himself to the @entity10 , to avoid any public impression he had done something wrong			1
' sir @entity2 put his own reputation as an individual above the need to ensure that a proper and transparent process was followed			2
@entity253 , of the @entity252 , said sir @entity2 should be stripped of his knighthood , police pension and other accolades ' sir @entity2 's pre-occupation with what the public would think of him as an individual led him to try to adopt a process , and persuade others to adopt a process , which removed the independent consideration of the issues from the committee whose responsibility it was to make that decision			1
' instead , he was trying to present them with a ' fait accompli ' that they could then endorse , rather than allow them to reach their own decisions without his influence			0
' the @entity10 found that , in doing this , sir @entity2 exploited his privileged access to the police authority			1
it said : ' it is accepted that , following the publication of the @entity12 report , sir @entity2 was under a great deal of media scrutiny and criticism			2
' while he may have wanted to try to mitigate that criticism , the way he tried to do that was not acceptable			0
' his actions ... do not suggest that he was seeking to avoid an investigation of his actions regarding the @entity7 disaster			0
' instead , they can more accurately be described as seeking to manipulate the referral process and the way that referral and the investigation following that referral were seen by the public			0
' reacting to the report , @entity253 , of the @entity252 , suggested sir @entity2 should be stripped of his knighthood , police pension and other accolades			1
she said : ' in the @entity10 's own words , this was gross misconduct and , in my mind , that is a very serious offence and the fact that he resigned should not mean that this report is the end of it			2
' we want to see him stripped of his honours - his knighthood and his @entity314 from @entity316 @entity315			0
' i believe he resigned to protect his pension and his behaviour has shown he is not deserving of that pension			0
' mrs @entity253 , who lost her 18 - year - old son , @entity320 , in the disaster , added that today 's report was ' another step on the road to justice ' for the 96 victims			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
