authorities in @entity1 have released the 911 call that led to two ' free range ' getting picked up and held by police and @entity5 for five hours over the weekend			1
the unnamed caller gave the operator a blow - by - blow account as he wandered behind @entity9 , 10 , and his sister @entity10 , 6 , in @entity11 on sunday			1
the 7 - minute call would reignite a controversy focused on those kids and their scientist parents , @entity16 and @entity17 , who espouse the hands - off parenting style			1
the caller , who was out walking his dog in the suburb adjacent to @entity22 , said he saw ' two kids that are unaccompanied , and they 've been walking around for probably about 20 minutes by themselves			0
' scene : the 911 call that reignited the ' free - range ' parenting controversy for two @entity28 parents has been released and reveals that @entity9 , 10 , and his sister @entity10 , 6 , were picked up by police while walking through this vicinity of the @entity22 - adjacent suburb of @entity11 on sunday the operator asked , ' have you talked to them to see , you know , why are they just walking around by themselves ? ' ' no , no , they came up and asked to pet my dog , i let them , and that was it ... i do n't want to scare them , ' he said			1
the man continued to tail the children , who eventually did become frightened when they realized they were being followed , until police arrived			0
their parents @entity16 and @entity17 have been cited multiple times for allowing their kids to roam free in their suburban neighborhood			1
but the @entity52 say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up @entity9 and @entity10 and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents			1
picked up : officials seized @entity10 , 6 , ( far left ) and 10 - year - old @entity9 ( left , blue hat ) on sunday in a @entity28 park			1
the parents @entity16 and @entity17 ( right ) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours picked up again : the @entity52 say they were left to panic for hours by @entity5 workers after their children -- who they raise with a so - called ' free - range ' approach -- were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone attorney @entity72 , of the firm @entity73 , is representing the @entity52 and on tuesday sent a pointed letter regarding sunday 's events			1
@entity76 wrote : ' the actions of @entity5 and @entity78 violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children			1
' this fundamental , constitutional right of parents can not be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent 's reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children			2
' the firm declined to say who the suit would be against , exactly , when asked by the @entity90			0
however , the attorney has vowed to pursue ' all legal remedies ' to protect the rights of the @entity28 parents			2
the @entity52 made headlines just before @entity96 when police found @entity9 and @entity10 walking the sidewalk on their own			1
' besides the policeman pulling up ... no ' : asked if he was scared during the hours - long ordeal sunday , 10 - year - old @entity9 admitted he was , but not because he 'd been left alone with his sister free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '			1
' helicopter parents ' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring , micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe			0
however critics believe this creates under - confident , over-reliant children , while also causing the parents stress			0
free - range parents advocate a more hands - off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own			2
instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe , the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time , and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves			0
on sunday , a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home			0
the children were picked up by police , who say they followed protocol by turning them over to @entity5			2
meanwhile , mrs @entity143 tells @entity144 that @entity5 workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe			2
what 's more , the elder child , @entity9 , insists the scariest part of the hours - long ordeal was being picked up by police			1
' they kept the kids for hours , ' a shaken @entity143 told @entity144 5 after being reunited with them			0
' it 's 10:30 at night			0
they 've been missing since 6 o'clock â€¦ somebody called 911 and the police called @entity5 and they decided to bring the kids here and they did n't call us			1
' according to mrs. @entity143 , the children were expected home no later than 6:30			0
when 6:30 came and went , they became frantic			0
they would not receive a call from @entity5 until 8pm			0
even then , they say they were n't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours			1
in the interim , @entity9 tells @entity144 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift			2
@entity9 said : ' the policeman said ' we 'll give you a ride home ' when we were like two blocks away			0
and two and a half hours later , after sitting in the car two and a half hours , he said ' i 'll bring you home ' and , instead , he brought us here			0
' ' here ' was @entity183 , @entity9 said			0
and as he and his sister sat waiting to go home , their parents say ' upper management ' at @entity5 was involved in keeping that from happening			2
only at 10:30pm did mrs. @entity143 say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash			0
parenting style : the @entity52 believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age guarantees : as part of their free - range parenting philosophy , the @entity52 make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street ' they made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up , ' and i 'm not gon na risk my kids being snatched again like this by @entity5			1
' when questioned , the @entity52 say they believe in a so - called ' free - range ' approach to parenting , which encourages independence from infancy			1
in march , the @entity5 found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone			1
it meant the agency would start a file on the family 's activities and whereabouts for at least five years			0
the @entity52 hit back at the ruling , insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences			2
unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge , but is in most cases a prelude to such charges			0
it usually comes when the @entity5 has deemed parents to have neglected their children , but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action .			2

police seized @entity9 , 10 , and @entity10 , 6 , in a @entity28 park on sunday and their parents say they were n't reunited by @entity5 for hours
scientists @entity16 and @entity17 believe in ' free range parenting ' meaning the children are afforded total independence from infancy
the @entity52 were found guilty of neglect in march . after sunday 's *incident* they were forced sign a paper *pledging* not to leave them unattended
