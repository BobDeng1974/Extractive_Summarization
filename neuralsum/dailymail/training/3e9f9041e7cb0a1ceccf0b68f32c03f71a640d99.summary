mr @entity9 , who will be 92 later this month while his wife will be 94 , failed to turn up to their first date after he was scrambled to go on another raid - and had forgotten to ask for her name			1

within weeks he had proposed			0
mr @entity9 waves from the cockpit of a restored @entity16 bomber mrs @entity22 said : ' i think it went something like , " if i 'm alive at the end of the year , we 'll get married "			1
