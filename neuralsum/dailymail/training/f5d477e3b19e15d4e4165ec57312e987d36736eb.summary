there 's a pile of office payslips sitting on the desk in front of you and no one else is around			0
could you resist a little peek to reveal how much your colleagues are being paid ? if you think temptation would get the better of you - you are in the minority , but only just			2
a new study into nosy @entity13 revealed that in this enticing situation more than two in five ( 41 per cent ) would not be able to restrain themselves			1
out of those , one in five ( 20 per cent ) admitted they ’d briefly skim through the top ones			2
a more daring eight per cent would flick through the whole stack whilst a less brave ( but more devious ) 13 per cent said they would try to find a trusted colleague to snoop in their stead			2
fifty per cent of @entity23 said they would snoop on colleagues payslips but nearly two thirds of @entity27 and a similar proportion of @entity30 respondents would resist believing it ’s ‘ none of their business ’ the nosiest group by far were – perhaps unsurprisingly – competitive @entity23 ( 50 per cent said they would snoop )			1
by far the least inquisitive were @entity27 and @entity30			1
nearly two thirds of @entity27 ( 64 per cent ) and a similar proportion ( 62 per cent ) of @entity30 respondents would resist looking at the payslips stating it ’s ‘ none of their business ’			1
overwhelmingly , the @entity40 chose the less daring option of not looking at the payslips themselves but convincing a colleague to snoop instead			2
the most likely ( 29 per cent ) to quickly scan through the top of the pile were from the @entity47 , however @entity48 turned out to be the most intrepid : they were the most likely to read through the entire pile , even ahead of competitive @entity23			0
the research was carried out by online anonymous diary site @entity52 as part of an experiment to discover how nosy and gossipy we are as a nation			2
the survey , which polled 2,000 individuals , also tested our our ability to keep a secret			0
the region most likely to tittle - tattle was the @entity47 , with a staggering 72 per cent admitting they ’d be unable to keep the secret of an office affair the telling research found that on discovering a work colleague was having an affair , a staggering two thirds of us would be unable to keep the knowledge to ourselves			1
only a meager 31 per cent would consider it to be ‘ none of our business ’ and keep mum			0
of the two thirds ( 66 per cent ) who would be unable to contain themselves , a relatively cautious 36 per cent would only share the information with people outside the office but a less discreet 30 per cent admit they ’d let the cat out of the bag at work			1
of those , one in ten would purposely drop subtle hints or try to share the secret anonymously , one in eight ( 13 per cent ) would tell their closest co-workers and 4 per cent say that despite their best intentions they ’d be likely to accidentally let it slip			0
a rather judgmental 2 per cent would share the information openly with everyone , feeling morally justified to do so			0
a new study into nosy @entity13 revealed 41 per cent would not be able to resist looking at confidential documents one percent would ‘ tell everyone ’ because the secret is ‘ too exciting to withhold ! ’ the region most likely to tittle - tattle was the @entity47 , with a staggering 72 per cent admitting they ’d be unable to keep the secret			1
once again @entity30 and @entity27 were the most discreet , with 45 per cent and 42 per cent respectively saying it was ‘ none of their business ’ those most likely to intend to keep schtum yet admit they ’d probably accidentally let the secret slip were @entity48 – six times more likely to do this than @entity106			1
surprisingly , @entity27 were the most likely by far to feel justified if openly sharing the information as ‘ an affair is morally wrong ’ – three times more likely to say this than other regions			1
no respondents from @entity113 , @entity114 or the @entity47 chose this option , compared with three per cent of @entity27			1
the poll was conducted by @entity117 , which already hosts close to 40,000 anonymous journals covering intimate aspects of people ’s lives : from cheeky sexual escapades to accounts of infidelity , bereavement and addiction			0
it allows users – who can not be identified even by the website ’s own internal staff – to post 200 words about their lives each day alongside music , videos or photos			0
@entity117 founder @entity136 said : ' the stratospheric growth our site has enjoyed since it launched shows there is clearly a natural curiosity about others ’ private thoughts and real life confessions – as well as an inherent desire to share our own secrets , so we wanted to find out how these attitudes vary around the @entity13			0
' this research into our penchant for tittle - tattle shows that whilst @entity13 might have a reputation of keeping a ‘ stiff upper lip ’ we appear to have a very mobile lower one ! '			0
