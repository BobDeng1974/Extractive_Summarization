@entity1 grandee : @entity2 said ragwort was a big problem in his part of @entity6 young unemployed people should be made to pull up ragwort from roadside verges in return for benefits , a @entity1 grandee has said			2
former conservative cabinet minister @entity2 , 83 , made the proposal to combat the rampant weed in a letter to an insect charity			1
he wrote to @entity16 , chief executive of a charity called @entity18 , which is concerned about the effect of declining ragwort on bees and rare insects			2
@entity2 said ragwort was a major problem in his part of @entity6 and proposed it could be weeded out by ‘ @entity24 ’ - young people who are not in education , work or training - and ‘ low level criminals ’			1
@entity29 , also known as @entity30 , is a common wildflower which is poisonous to cattle and horses			0
he wrote : ‘ i suggest you come to the @entity37 / @entity36 border areas of @entity6			0
landowners who wish to control ragwort face an impossible task when roadside verges are dominated by it to an extent i can not remember in the past			0
‘ there would be little cost to bring that under control if @entity47 and low level criminals were required as part of their contribution to the society which finances them , or which they have abused … to uproot this weed			1
’ @entity2 later told the @entity54 : ‘ given a bit of organisation , they would be happy doing something constructive			2
that ’s something constructive for them			0
‘ it ’s appealing , it gets rid of a weed which is a danger to some animals and helps landowners in the cultivation of their land			0
collected from roadside verges : @entity29 , also known as @entity30 , is a common wildflower which is poisonous to cattle and horses ( file picture ) criticism : @entity74 ( above ) , the shadow welfare reform minister , said the comments reflected the ' values of the @entity78 workhouse ' in which out - of - work people were forced to perform demeaning , unpaid labour ‘ that was my thought that caused me to suggest the idea … in a way it ’s a form of national service , of doing something for society in a way in which anyone unless they are physically disabled can participate			1
’ asked whether he acknowledged some might find the idea of forced labour in return for benefits controversial , he said : ‘ it ’s workfare but i think there are some powerful arguments for workfare and so does [ @entity100 mp ] @entity99 for example			1
it ’s not a way - out idea in that sense			0
‘ if you go back to the @entity106 on which the whole welfare state has been based , you ’ll find he took the view that youngsters who had never worked should not receive benefits because they have not contributed anything			0
’ suggestion : @entity2 , pictured with his wife @entity112 in april at their home in @entity115 , @entity36 previous comments : @entity2 , who was a minister under @entity117 ( together in 1982 ) , was famous for telling the jobless to get on their bikes and look for work - as his father had in the 1930s @entity2 wrote to @entity16 ( pictured ) , chief executive of @entity18 , which is concerned about the effect of declining ragwort on bees and rare insects he added : ‘ i am much more modest about this than @entity131 was and i suspect @entity132 might have been on my side in it			1
i just think a lot of those youngsters want something to do which is constructive			0
’ however , @entity100 mp @entity74 , the shadow welfare reform minister , said the comments reflected the ‘ values of the @entity78 workhouse ’ in which out - of - work people were forced to perform demeaning , unpaid labour			1
he told the @entity54 : ‘ there ’s one weed that i would like to uproot : it ’s sitting in the @entity145			0
' @entity2 ’s proposal , which effectively equates being out of work with being a criminal , is both offensive and ludicrous			2
’ @entity2 , who was a minister under @entity117 , was famous for telling the jobless to get on their bikes and look for work – as his father had in the 1930s .			1
