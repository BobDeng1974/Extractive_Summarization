by @entity0 published : 11:55 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 11:55 est , 2 june 2013 the popularity of @entity3 music is declining internationally as fans around the world choose to listen to music produced in their own country instead			1
@entity3 's share of the global pop charts has steadily dropped since the so - called @entity10 of the 1960s when @entity12 and the @entity13 ruled the world			1
research shows that while @entity3 is still punching above its weight , music fans are increasingly choosing to listen to songs produced by domestic artists			1
flying the flag : @entity21 and @entity22 were the only @entity23 to feature on a list of international ' superstars ' economists @entity26 , a professor at @entity28 , @entity29 , and his co-author @entity30 took data from the charts of 22 countries between 2001 and 2007 - which represented 98 per cent of the global music market			1
the project , which looked at the work of 23,000 artists , found that during the 1960s 30 per cent of music in the charts was made by a @entity40			1
since then it has steadily declined after a brief jump in the mid- 80s when bands like @entity44 and @entity45 were the most popular groups in the world			0
the popularity of @entity49 music has continued to grow but the emergence of the internet has also helped artists from smaller countries			2
according to the economists , 31 artists appeared in at least 18 country 's charts simultaneously for at least a year between 2001 and 2007			1
twenty - three , such as @entity61 , @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity60 , were from the @entity49 @entity3 invasion : @entity3 artists made up 30 per cent of the international charts in the 1960s but its share has declined almost continuously since industry boost : bands like @entity44 ( pictured ) and @entity45 ! helped increase @entity3 share in the 1980s only 31 artists across the world featured simultaneously in 18 countries 's pop chats for at least one year : @entity49 artists : @entity74 - ( @entity76 but first album made in the @entity49 ) @entity61 @entity77 @entity78 @entity79 @entity58 @entity80 @entity59 @entity81 ( @entity83 but first album made in the @entity49 ) @entity84 @entity85 @entity86 @entity87 @entity60 @entity88 @entity89 @entity90 @entity91 p ! @entity92 @entity93 @entity94 @entity95 @entity96 @entity3 artists : @entity21 and @entity22 others @entity99 ( @entity100 ) @entity101 ( @entity102 ) @entity103 ( @entity104 ) @entity105 ( @entity106 ) @entity107 ( @entity108 ) @entity109 ( @entity110 ) just two @entity23 - @entity21 and @entity22 - made it onto the elite list			1
@entity49 music currently makes up 60 per cent of the charts , up from about 40 per cent in the mid- 1980s			2
despite @entity49 dominance in the list of ' superstars ' , @entity26 and @entity30 said the amount of music bought by indigenous stars is also on the rise			0
in the 1980s about half of the music bought was by domestic artists but by 2007 that had increased to 70 per cent			0
they credited the growth of the internet and @entity129 as helping to ' democratise ' music and help increase the popularity of home - grown artists			2
the authors said : ' some smaller countries actually benefit substantially in this global market , as they are able to achieve market shares that are sometimes two or three times larger than the relative sizes of their economies			0
' moreover , new technologies that lower trade costs do not appear to have a destructive effect on local production and consumption of music			0
' it is not all bad news for the @entity3 music industry either			1
the @entity3 is one of just six countries - alongside @entity153 , @entity154 , the @entity49 , @entity155 and @entity76 - whose music industry share is greater than their relative gdp share			2
the report , published in the @entity159 , found : ' despite widespread fears about @entity49 dominance , music trade is roughly proportional to countries ' gdps ' @entity3 music sales were 52 per cent higher than its relative world gdp share			1
@entity153 - the home of the likes of @entity169 and the @entity170 - had sales 59 per cent above its gdp , compared to @entity49 's 33 per cent			0
@entity26 said far from killing diversity in the music industry , @entity129 and the growth of the internet has actually had a positive effect			0
he said : ' overall , our findings suggest that concern about cultural domination by large economies – particularly the @entity49 – may be misplaced for music			0
' although , the study does not include digital sales in the past six years , the trend suggests the internet will continue to help artists , such as @entity190 's @entity189 , reach a global audience			0
the internet has helped artists like @entity189 , from @entity190 , reach a global audience			0

study found popularity of @entity3 music declining internationally
domestically produced music featuring more *heavily* in international charts
@entity21 and @entity22 only @entity23 to make it to list of artists that appeared simultaneously in 18 countries ' pop charts for at least a year
study by leading economists found @entity3 is still punching above its weight
