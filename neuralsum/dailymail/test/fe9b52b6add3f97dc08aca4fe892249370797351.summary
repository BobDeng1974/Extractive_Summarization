an intriguing picture on @entity1 has given an insight into the meticulous preparation of a commentator for a football match			2
@entity8 commentator @entity7 's notes for monday night 's @entity10 clash between @entity11 and @entity12 at @entity13 were posted ahead of kick - off			1
@entity8 commentator @entity7 's commentary notes for @entity11 's league match against @entity12 @entity7 has worked for the @entity8 since 2004 and @entity7 was not far off from correctly predicting the starting line - ups , naming 19 of the 22 players who took to the field			1
however , he surprisingly , and incorrectly , predicted that 18 - year - old midfielder @entity21 would make his first @entity11 start			0
instead @entity23 returned from injury , while @entity21 was an unused substitute in @entity11 's 2 - 0 win at @entity13			1
the notes are thorough from start to finish with numbers for appearances , goals , transfer fees and other interesting tidbits to keep the millions of listeners across the country well informed			0
@entity11 goalkeeper @entity36 's political science degree is noted , as is the fact that @entity23 - though the 19 - year - old 's first name was spelt incorrectly in the notes as ' @entity23 ' - was born on @entity42 's first birthday			1
also mentioned is @entity12 goalkeeper @entity43 congratulating @entity45 's @entity44 on his goal in the recent @entity47 , @entity50 's @entity49 grandad , and the fact that @entity12 defender @entity52 is a @entity11 fan			1
@entity7 , 43 , was the youngest ever television commentator on a @entity54 final when he covered the 1998 edition for @entity56			0
he has worked for the @entity8 since 2004			0
@entity8 's commentators now have it harder than ever after a recent change to bring the station 's games in line with tv coverage , with just one commentator and one summariser			2
in previous years there had been two commentators who switched at the mid-point of each half , with a summariser interjecting for 90 minutes			0
however since 2012 the @entity8 commentaries have been reduced to a single commentator , putting more pressure on the likes of @entity7 to be better prepared than ever			2
@entity42 celebrates after scoring the opening goal for @entity11 at @entity13 on monday night @entity7 's notes are more detailed , but less colourful than those produced by another @entity8 commentator , @entity77 , who works for the corporation 's @entity12			1
@entity77 posts some of his notes for @entity12 games on @entity1 , complete with his commentary microphone , showing off his artistry as well as his research			0
the local radio commentator 's notebook included hand - drawn kits and national flags for each player , as well as colour - coded notes on the visiting club 's form and the predicted line - ups in formation			2
@entity77 ' notebook , from a picture posted to @entity1 , showing his notes on @entity96 ahead of their game against @entity45 last week @entity77 tweeted his notes on @entity12 ahead of the 154th @entity98 , which @entity45 won at @entity99			0
