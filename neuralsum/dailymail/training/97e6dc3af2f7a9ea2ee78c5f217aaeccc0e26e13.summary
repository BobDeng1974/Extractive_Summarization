by @entity0 published : 16:52 est , 14 november 2013 @entity2 : 16:53 est , 14 november 2013 parts of @entity5 engines powering passenger jets could soon be made by 3d printers			1
the @entity9 firm says the technique could allow it to produce complicated components more quickly and cheaply			2
3d printers , which are available in high street shops , make solid objects from digital models instead of reproducing text or images on paper			1
elaborate : the engineering company has said it could build its famous passenger jet engines , pictured , from parts made by 3d printers the 3d printers , some which will fit on to a desktop , create three - dimensional objects rather than 2 - dimensional images on a page			2
@entity5 head of technology strategy dr @entity29 said : ‘ one of the great advantages in the aerospace world is that some of these parts that we make have very long lead times , because of the tooling process			1
‘ and then it takes potentially 18 months to get the first part after placing an order - versus printing it , which could be done quite rapidly			2
even if it takes a week to print , that ’s still a lot faster			0
‘ 3d printing opens up new possibilities			1
through the 3d printing process , you ’re not constrained by having to get a tool in to create a shape			1
you can create any shape you like			0
‘ there are studies that show one can create better lightweight structures , because you just take the analogy of what nature does and how bones are built up			0
and so things that are simple things like brackets can be made a lot lighter			0
’ hi - tech to high street : 3d printers are now available in shops for around £ 1,600 and are moving into mass production dr @entity29 said @entity5 could also make cost savings because it would not need to spend money to store key parts but could ‘ print ’ them as required			1
the technology is set to transform many areas of manufacturing			2
sales of 3d printers soared last year to £ 1.5billion and is expected to hit £ 4billion by 2017 , say @entity80 experts at analysts @entity82			0
savings : using printing technology to make parts could save substantial sums currently spent on lengthy construction and storage once seen as a hi - tech piece of specialist equipment , 3d printers have begun to move into mass production in recent months			1
high street electronics store @entity94 is selling the first version on the high street for £ 1,600			1
the technology dates back to the 1980s when 3d printers used plastics			2
but the latest versions of the technology is capable of building complex shapes from ceramics and metal			0
they can be programmed to create a host of items , from sports shoes ton hip - replacement and hit the headlines recently amid claims they were being used to manufacture parts for guns			0
scientists are even experimenting with the technology with a view to using cells to create spare body parts and organs			2
pupils in @entity9 schools are also to be taught to experiment with the technology under new government plans to drive up standards in subjects such as maths and science			0
@entity129 ’s @entity128 is currently exhibiting 600 3d printed objects			0
@entity5 plc chief executive @entity131 has vowed to crack down on costs in a bid to keep up with arch - rivals in the aero - engine world such as @entity137 giant @entity136 which also plans to use 3d printers , including to form fuel nozzles for jet engines			0
@entity142 electronics giant @entity141 and car - maker and aero - engine manufactuerer @entity145 are also developing 3d printing applications			1
@entity147 , exhibition leader at @entity129 ’s @entity128 said : ‘ 3d printing enables engineers and designers to manufacture things they could n’t make with traditional methods			1
‘ every day we learn about new ways in which people from across society are capitalising on the technology to realise their ideas and enrich people ’s lives			0

the new technique could allow quicker and cheaper production
head of technology strategy dr @entity29 *hailed* the development
he said it could cut the production time of complicated parts by months
3d printing technology is now available on the high street
