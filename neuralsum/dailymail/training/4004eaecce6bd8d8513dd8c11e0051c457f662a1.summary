for @entity1 all that counts is the result			0
somehow , this @entity4 team got there in the end			2
the playing conditions , along with that feeling you get at the start of a new season and facing a team without a manager should have suited them down to a tee			0
@entity4 were ordinary , a world away from the team that stripped @entity19 of their self - respect at @entity22 in the @entity23			1
last - gasp : @entity24 ( right ) is congratulated after pouncing in stoppage time to earn all three points for @entity4 against @entity27 at the @entity28 poacher : @entity24 finished from close range after @entity31 was unable to hang on to @entity33 's effort roar of delight : @entity36 celebrates with @entity37 after heading @entity4 level on the stroke of half - time at the @entity28 twist and turn : the @entity44 defender timed his run to perfection to get in behind the @entity27 defence and meet a lovely free - kick from @entity48 on the left well beaten : goalkeeper @entity31 can only watch helplessly as the ball flies past him and nestles in the bottom corner of the net breakthrough : @entity54 ( fourth right ) is congratulated by his @entity27 team - mates after heading them into the lead after 35 minutes towering : @entity54 timed his run to the front post perfectly to meet @entity60 's inswinging corner and put @entity27 in front @entity4 : @entity62 6 , @entity33 5.5 , @entity63 6.5 , @entity36 7 , @entity64 6 ( @entity65 53 ) , @entity66 5.5 , @entity67 7 ( @entity68 69 ) , @entity24 6.5 , @entity69 5.5 , @entity48 6 , @entity70 5 ( @entity71 62 ) substitutes not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 scorers : @entity36 45 ; @entity24 90 booked : @entity63 , @entity69 @entity27 : @entity31 6.5 , @entity77 6.5 , @entity54 6 , @entity78 7 ( @entity79 74 ) , @entity80 6.5 , @entity60 6 , @entity81 7 , @entity82 7 , @entity83 6 ( @entity84 90 ) , @entity85 7.5 , @entity74 6.5 ( @entity86 85 ) substitutes not used : @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 scorer : @entity54 35 booked : @entity60 , @entity77 , @entity85 sent off : @entity60 referee : @entity93 attendance : 59,962 player ratings by @entity96 at the @entity28 @entity27 , without a manager after @entity98 walked away on thursday evening , felt aggrieved			1
yes , they probably deserved a point			2
that was until @entity24 , a tad subdued in the centre of @entity4 ’s midfield alongside @entity67 , came to their rescue in the final minute			1
for once the @entity4 fans stayed with their team , waiting patiently for the moment when they could win this game with @entity24 ’s stabbed effort			1
‘ i am grateful to the fans because we have to face up to the frustration , ’ admitted @entity1			0
‘ when we were one nil down they stayed behind the team , and at 1 - 1 they gave us some energy			2
’ at 2 - 1 , they had done their job , sticking it out and sending their supporters scurrying home happy			2
@entity24 ’s goal was in the last knockings , when @entity27 were down to ten men after @entity60 was foolishly sent off for a second booking			1
it was reckless and ill - disciplined , the kind of mistake that would have had @entity98 having kittens in the technical area			2
@entity4 , though , are up and running , recovering from the setback of @entity54 ’s debut goal in the 35th minute to go on and secure their first three points of the season			1
they were far from impressive			0
perhaps , in time , we will look back on this result and salute them for sticking this out to the bitter end and biting @entity27 where it really hurts			1
it is a measure of any decent team that they are prepared to be patient at times , waiting for the moment to pounce			0
@entity27 will know that , particularly after some slack marking allowed @entity36 to run unmarked into their penalty area and guide @entity48 ’s free kick beyond @entity31			1
@entity48 has the touches , whipping the @entity4 crowd into a frenzy with a series of step - overs at bewildering speed in the first half			1
what a player he can be			0
‘ he needs to improve his understanding with his team - mates , ’ was @entity1 ’s assessment of the £ 33m @entity162 winger			2
in time it will come			0
striding away : @entity48 gets clear of palace duo @entity80 ( left ) and @entity82 as the new signing from @entity168 shows what he can do foot in : @entity83 attempts to cut out a cross from @entity4 's right - back @entity33 whoops : referee @entity173 has a little trouble with the vanishing spray now used in @entity177 games , spraying it accidentally into @entity69 's face stinging : @entity69 turns away to rub his eyes after the referee 's malfunction with the can of vanishing spray marker : vanishing spray is used to mark the correct position of a free - kick taken by @entity4 's @entity69 busy week : @entity27 chairman @entity188 in the stands at the @entity28 after a week in which manager @entity98 left the club unimpressed : @entity4 manager @entity1 wears an annoyed expression as he stands on the touchline @entity194 miles @entity4 total 110.4 68.6 @entity24 90 11.9 7.4 @entity66 90 11.1 6.9 @entity33 90 11.1 6.9 @entity27 total 109.7 68.2 @entity85 90 11.5 7.2 @entity82 90 11.2 6.9 @entity81 90 11.0 6.9 so , too , will the performances from this entire @entity4 team as they settle into the rhythm of the regular season			1
they have already lost @entity64 to a hamstring injury and they can not allow another congested medical room to affect their season			0
there are other issues , such as the scandalous failure to spot @entity54 ’s run for his debut goal			1
not one @entity4 player tracked him			2
it was a training ground move , straight out of @entity98 ’s book and brilliantly executed by @entity54 when his diagonal run met @entity60 ’s left - footed inswinging corner			1
in midfield the nice touches from @entity67 , @entity66 , @entity69 , @entity48 and @entity24 were going nowhere			1
they lacked direction and purpose			0
@entity36 ’s set - piece equaliser changed the game , giving @entity4 the impetus to start the second half in a different gear			1
the highlights must include @entity37 ’ performance at the back			0
he was exceptional , breezing through this game and adapting to his new role in the team			0
his positioning and anticipation is first class , a refreshing way to look at a young , @entity238 central defender			0
he is a top signing			0
@entity1 knows it and there is a chance that the former @entity244 right - back will face @entity245 in tuesday ’s @entity247 qualifier in @entity248 on tuesday			0
domestic matters will dominate at @entity27 this week as attentions turn to the appointment of a new manager			2
@entity27 ’s directors held a board meeting before saturday ’s game , but they have yet to make a decision on the identity of their next manager			2
@entity259 to head : @entity260 of @entity4 goes up for the ball with giant @entity27 centre - half @entity54 @entity262 and large : @entity48 turns away with the ball as @entity27 's @entity82 tries to catch up with him painful : @entity48 grimaces during his first @entity177 start following his £ 30m move from @entity168 bit of a stretch : palace captain @entity81 positions his body to try and stop @entity24 from advancing forward for @entity4 at the helm : @entity27 caretaker manager @entity268 gives the thumbs up from the sidelines			1
he is in temporary charge after @entity98 left the club on the charge : new @entity4 signing @entity33 attempts to get clear of @entity27 's @entity83 during the first - half of the match sunny delight : @entity4 fans shield their eyes from the early evening sun at the @entity28 as @entity177 football returns for another season grilling : @entity1 is questioned by a reporter from @entity283 ahead of the match new hero : an @entity4 fan with a shirt with the name and number of @entity48 and a @entity291 flag outside the @entity28 before the match @entity4 ’s chronic set piece problems look likely to continue			1
new full - back @entity33 was guilty of completely losing scorer @entity54 for the opening goal , with the @entity27 defender ending up five yards off his marker			1
it remains an area of concern for @entity1 particularly when @entity301 is unavailable			0
there is an outside chance that they will give it to @entity268 , the impressive and unassuming caretaker coach who took the team yesterday			0
he said : ‘ i will speak to the chairman			0
the players respect me and my decisions			0
‘ it is the start of the season and only one game into it , but we know we can compete at this level			0
‘ we have identified the areas we need to strengthen and the three players we brought in did well			0
’ they did , but they switched off at the crucial moment when @entity36 ’s header was knocked back across goal by @entity71 , before @entity33 ’s shot was parried by @entity31 only for @entity24 to prod it home			1
without @entity24 , @entity4 would be facing up to some familiar problems .			1

@entity24 turned ball in from close range in stoppage time to earn @entity4 all three points after @entity31 could *n't* hold point - blank shot from @entity33
@entity54 headed @entity27 into a 35th - minute lead with a near - post dart to meet @entity60 's corner
@entity36 met an @entity48 free - kick to head @entity4 level on stroke of half - time
@entity60 picks up second *yellow* card late as @entity27 's *stubborn* *resistance* is finally broken
@entity48 impressed on @entity177 debut following £ 30m move from @entity168
