by @entity0 last updated at 3:33 pm on 28th december 2011 at first glance , this picturesque @entity2 manor house appears to have little in common with the grand mansion featured in @entity5			1
but according to historian @entity8 , @entity6 in @entity7 is the building that inspired writer @entity9 to create his hit television show			1
for mr @entity8 has revealed that the house once employed @entity14 winner 's family as servants			1
at that time it was far larger boosting a further 60 rooms			1
it was only downsized to its present size after the owner demolished an entire wing to save money			1
as it stands today : the manor house is half of its original size after an entire wing was demolished to save money and make it a more manageable size as grand as @entity5 : @entity6 as it stood in 1885 after it had been extended adding a further 60 rooms @entity34 which is used as the backdrop for the tv series			1
historian @entity8 said : ' it is easy to see the similarities between what it was like at the @entity41 and what is shown on @entity5			1
' the manor house once employed the family of @entity5 series writer @entity9 ( right ) as household servants but back in the 1800s when @entity9 ' relatives worked on the @entity49 estate @entity50 was the hub of the wealthy and well - heeled			1
@entity52 has revealed that in 1875 @entity9 great - grandfather , @entity54 , worked for landowner @entity55			1
@entity5 's @entity56 is believed to be based on mr @entity55 who was a wealthy director of two railway companies as well as the owner of @entity6			1
it was during this period that the buildling was given a massive makeover and the building was extended with a further 60 rooms being added			1
@entity52 said : ' the son of @entity66 , @entity67 had very grand ideas and he wanted to extend the buildings			1
' he had great plans for expanding it and they built on it far more than they ever needed			2
' @entity67 made considerable changes to the house soon after his father 's death in 1885			2
' setting the scene : in the hit tv series , @entity5 provides a grand backdrop for the drama centered around the @entity83 family @entity84 who plays housemaid @entity85 in the series			1
historian @entity87 said the servants in the country house drama look too clean and act far too familiar with their employers			2
but some 30 years later after the house had been sold to a former army general the extensions were reversed to become a 32 - room building			1
@entity52 is n't sure when this took place but placed it between 1907 and 1926			2
' the servants in the programme are far too clean			2
the reality would have been a lot more grubby , i do n't think people realise the servants stank ' he said : ' the general 's wife was widowed and it was too much for her to take on			2
' it is a lovely building and much of what you see in @entity5 reflected life at @entity6			1
' the @entity112 were wealthy landowners and were very much at the heart of the local community			2
' it is easy to see the similarities between what it was like at the @entity41 and what is shown on @entity5			1
' however , despite the plaudits the series has received some experts are critical that the series is not as true to the past as it could be			2
historian @entity87 said the image of life at @entity5 is completely wrong and ' infuriating to watch '			1
she claims the servants in the country house drama look too clean and act far too familiar with their employers			0
' i find it infuriating to watch , it sets my teeth on edge , ' she said			0
' the relationship they have with their employers is totally wrong			0
' viewers who watched the @entity140 special saw members of the aristocratic @entity143 family support valet @entity144 and his wife , housemaid @entity146 , during his trial and eventual conviction for his first wife 's murder			0
the @entity152 also hosted a dance for the servants			0
the two - hour episode ended with @entity156 finally going down on one knee and proposing to @entity158			0
ms @entity87 , the editor of @entity160 magazine and author of a new book called women 's lives , has read hundreds of letters and diaries kept by people who worked in service and the families they worked for			0
' there was one butler who said that even if in a moment of weakness an employer could ask for advice they would n't give it because it could be held against them , ' she said			0
' the servants in the programme are far too clean			0
the reality would have been a lot more grubby , i do n't think people realise the servants stank			0
gun enthusiast and former editor of the @entity186 , @entity187 , also picked out inaccuracies with clothes during the @entity140 special			0
mr @entity187 , 74 , said the show was ' full of errors ' , especially the scene involving the game shoot			0
' the scene is supposed to depict a shooting party in 1919 - 20 , but they are dressed as though they are in the 1890s , ' he said			0
' it is full of errors			0
why on earth did n't they do their research properly and get it right			0
' mr @entity187 , who has published several books on shooting , added : ' the guns are wearing leather gaiters - an item of clothing that would not have been work during the @entity212			0
' all would have worn stockings , plus fours and possibility light - coloured spats			0
the only people who would have worn gaiters would have been the hired help			0

' it is a lovely building and much of what you see in @entity5 reflected life at @entity6 '
