by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 , @entity3 correspondent a wave of weddings among pensioners is driving a rise in the popularity of marriage , according to the latest official figures yesterday			1
the number of those aged between 65 and 70 who were married in 2012 went up by a quarter among men and more than a fifth among women			1
the growing trend to marriage in retirement points to a generation of pensioners who no longer believe their lives are settled when they collect their bus pass			1
it follows evidence of increasing levels of marriage breakdown among the newly - retired			1
there was an annual rise of five per cent in the overall number of weddings in @entity31 and @entity32 to 262,240 – the highest total in any year since 2004			0
although the fast - rising population is partly the cause , marriage rates are also at their highest since the mid- 2000s			2
there were more brides and grooms in every age group , but the figures from the @entity42 show that people are choosing to marry later in life			2
the average age of a bride is now 34 , compared to under 29 in the 1970s			0
the biggest leap in marriages was among those aged between 65 and 70			1
@entity51 in their late 60s increased by 25 per cent between 2011 and 2012 , to 3,520 , and brides of the same age went up by 21 per cent , to 1,990			0
around one in 10 were single before tying the knot , two thirds were divorced and the rest widowed			1
the overall rise in marriages was accompanied by an increase in couples choosing church weddings – up by 4.6 per cent in a year to 77,910 after years of decline			1
however seven out of 10 weddings are now civil ceremonies , most of them conducted in ‘ approved premises ’			2
@entity69 , of the @entity71 think - tank , said the figures were ‘ excellent ’ news but added : ‘ many more years of similar rises are needed to reverse the catastrophic long - term trend away from marriage			2
‘ the awful reality is that only one in six parents who do n’t get married stay together compared to four in six parents who do get married			0
less marriage means more family breakdown			0
’ the trend means the average age of marriage for men and women was 36 and 34 respectively , a figure which has been rising steadily after a slight fall in 2007 and 2008			1
@entity89 , head of family law at @entity92 solicitors , said : ' in the past , people might have considered that they might be too old to remarry once they 'd reached pension age			0
' ' however , that baby boomer generation with longer life expectancy , improved health and financial security can see that it 's not necessarily too late to start a new life			0
' going by current examples , it 's still possible to have a long and happy marriage after the age of 65			0
' however , the @entity42 also found that a third of marriages will end in divorce by the 20th wedding anniversary			1
commenting on the rise in pensioner weddings , @entity89 , of law firm @entity92 , said : ‘ the baby boomer generation with longer life expectancy , and improved health and financial security can see that it ’s not necessarily too late to start a new life			0
it ’s still possible to have a long and happy marriage after the age of 65			0
