earlier this year , global warming was blamed for the ‘ irreversible retreat ’ of west @entity3 glaciers			0
but now scientists claim that warming of the planet is in fact behind a paradoxical growth in @entity10 sea ice			1
the comments come as @entity13 ’s sea ice set a record this week , reaching 815,448 square miles ( 1,312,000 square km ) of ice above its normal range			1
@entity3 ice maps for september 2009 until september 2012 reveal an increase in the level of sea ice scientists believe the shift is caused by water melting from beneath the @entity3 ice shelves and re-freezing back on the surface			1
‘ the primary reason for this is the nature of the circulation of the @entity35 — water heated in high southern latitudes is carried equatorward , to be replaced by colder waters upwelling from below , which inhibits ice loss , ’ @entity26 , director of the @entity27 and @entity28 , told @entity29 at @entity30			1
however , as reported in a separate blog post by mr @entity29 , @entity41 scientist @entity40 said that growing @entity3 sea ice coverage is less significant a measure than declining @entity46 sea ice coverage when assessing climate change			1
earlier this year , global warming was blamed for the ' irreversible retreat ' of west @entity3 glaciers			0
but now scientists claim that warming of the planet is in fact behind a paradoxical expansion in @entity10 sea ice despite ice coverage increasing in some areas , @entity41 claims that in a few hundred years the irreversible melt that has already started from the @entity60 sector of the @entity13 ice sheet , pictured , has now ' passed the @entity62 ' and could eventually add four to 12 feet ( 1.2 to 3.7 metres ) to current sea levels on the left here is the elevation of the region , while on the right the various glaciers that will be affected by the melting of the @entity60 region			1
@entity41 scientist @entity40 said that growing @entity3 sea ice coverage is less significant a measure than declining @entity46 sea ice coverage when assessing climate change last year , team from the @entity75 found that the fresh water melting from the @entity3 ice sheets had a relatively low density compared to the denser salty seawater			1
this means that the water accumulates and freezes in the top layer of the ocean during the summer months , as reported in the @entity84			0
surrounded by @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , the @entity46 ice cap floats on the ocean , not land			0
it has lost a large amount of its older , thicker sea ice over the last 30 years , making it more vulnerable to the warming trend			2
last year , a team from the @entity98 's @entity75 found that the fresh water melting from the @entity3 ice sheets had a relatively low density compared to the denser salty seawater			1
this means that it accumulates in the top layer of the ocean during the summer months the @entity3 , however , is a continent circled by open waters that lets sea ice expand during the winter but also offers less shelter during the melt season			1
the @entity110 report found that despite the increase in surface ice expansion each winter , the total mass of ice around @entity13 is continuing to shrink because of the underwater ice melt			0
in may , @entity41 scientists told reporters that vast glaciers in @entity13 seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries			1
in a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet ( 1.2 to 3.7 metres ) to current sea levels			0
the @entity3 ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a new study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously believed			2
the study in may revealed that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago causing a rapid sea level rise			0
during one period 14,600 years ago , melting glaciers released so many icebergs into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft ( 2 metres ) in just 100 years			0
the results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in @entity3 's and reflect predictions for the region 's future			0
it also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the @entity3 ice sheet has already begun and could be ' unstoppable			2
' the study was conducted by an international team including researchers from @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			0
periods of rapid increase in iceberg - rafted debris suggest that more icebergs were being released by the @entity3 ice sheet			2
the researchers discovered increased amounts of debris during eight separate episodes beginning as early as 20,000 years ago , and continuing until 9,000 years ago			0
up until now , melting of @entity3 ice sheet was n't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago .			2

claim was made by @entity26 , director of the @entity27 and @entity28 , when *speaking* to @entity29 at talking about the *weather*
shift is caused by water melting from beneath the @entity3 ice shelves
scientists claim it is then *re-frozen* back on surface , increasing sea ice
however @entity41 warns that growing @entity3 sea ice is less significant a measure than declining @entity46 sea ice when assessing climate change
@entity13 ’s sea ice set a record this week , reaching 815,448 square miles ( 1,312,000 square km ) of ice above its normal range
