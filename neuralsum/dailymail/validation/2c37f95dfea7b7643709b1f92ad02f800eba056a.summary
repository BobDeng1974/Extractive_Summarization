@entity0 has taken a fight with the @entity2 to a new level - by countering what it sees as misleading , inaccurate reporting with a gif of a laughing baby			1
the search giant turned to fodder more usually seen on teenage blogs and social media in an escalating conflict based on a @entity13 report uncovered by the @entity2			2
the search giant used the looping clip while retaliating against an article in the newspaper which quoted the report , which uncovered officials ' reservations about @entity0 's business practices , and was supposed to remain private			2
gif war : a @entity0 public relations official deployed this picture of a laughing baby to counter reporting she objects to in the @entity2 boss : @entity28 , pictured , was the author of the blog post			1
she worked for the @entity30 before joining the search giant it also took umbrage to the suggestion that @entity0 staff members visiting the @entity37 230 times president @entity36 took office could have affected the probe			1
ultimately the @entity13 concluded that it was n't worth trying to sue @entity0 , and instead negotiated changes to its practices , which the company implemented			0
but rather than respond directly to what it saw as the @entity2 's inaccurate reporting , @entity0 posted the cutesy image and implied that the newspapers ' publishers were being hypocrites			2
implications : @entity28 's post took aim at @entity2 owner @entity52 , whose lower - brow publications were also given a mention @entity28 , senior vice president in @entity0 's @entity56 department , wrote the post , which began with aspersions against @entity59 , the company which ultimately owns the journal			1
she said : ' last year @entity61 , ceo of @entity59 , accused @entity0 of creating a " less informed , more vexatious level of dialogue in our society			0
" ' given the tone of some of your publications , that made quite a few people chuckle			0
' she then followed up with the baby gif			2
the mention of the ' tone ' of some @entity59 titles is evidently a reference to the fact that , as well as the @entity2 , @entity59 ultimately owns the @entity79 tabloid , as well as @entity80 in @entity81			0
she also responded to the @entity2 's supposed claims that @entity0 has ' undue political influence ' by linking to a famous @entity80 front page claiming that its endorsement swayed the country 's 1992 general election			0
only then did @entity28 , a former high - ranking political adviser for the @entity30 , address a list of grievances with the @entity2 's report , which cited instances when @entity13 officials recommended suing @entity0			1
clincher : @entity28 used the above image to end her argument , after pointing out that @entity0 's business practices had been approved by several government bodies she also drew in another report which pointed out that @entity0 's 230 + meetings at the @entity37 during @entity36 's presidency , and cited an @entity13 statement saying the @entity2 had been ' misleading ' by juxtaposing that fact with reporting on the anti-competitive practices investigation			1
after citing a number of other rulings vindicating , by state - level government bodies and also officials in @entity108 , @entity28 fired off another gif - this one a jubilant @entity110 winning an argument			1
the piece was a seemingly rare intervention by @entity28 , who had n't written a blog for @entity0 since 2012			1
a recourse to gifs in otherwise serious discussion is n't unprecedented			0
in january , house speaker @entity118 fired off a salvo of 12 @entity121 gifs to trash the president 's community college plans			0
a spokesman for the @entity125 responded in time , harnessing the pop icon to declare ' haters gon na hate ' over @entity128 .			0
