by @entity0 published : 04:06 est , 16 march 2014 updated : 10:08 est , 16 march 2014 tracks on the £ 50billion @entity6 railway line should be laid in the north at the same time as the south , the project 's chief has said			1

development : work on the @entity6 will begin in @entity11 in 2017			1
but politicians and rail chiefs believe routes from northern cities such as @entity17 and @entity18 should be established at the same time @entity24 , the general secretary of the train driver union , told the @entity25 : ' let 's get as much of this built as possible and create a great railway			1

' creating jobs outside @entity11 , and closing the gap between north and south , has been one of this government 's top priorities , ' he said			2
' on every visit i make to the north of @entity66 , i 've heard businesses and council leaders make a compelling case for getting to the north more quickly by accelerating parts of the @entity6 build			1
' that would ensure the economic benefits can be shared sooner by everyone around the country and deserves serious consideration by government			0
' the controversial system , which has sparked protests in towns such as @entity82 , @entity83 , would see trains running between @entity11 and @entity85 by 2026 in contrast , shadow chancellor @entity86 said last week that it was important that sir @entity13 could show that costs ' have come down markedly '			1
mr @entity86 suggested if the costs were shown to have decreased and come under control then @entity93 would back @entity6 when it receives its second reading in the @entity95 in the coming weeks			0
he told @entity99 's the @entity98 : ' at every stage in this project for the next few years , because it 's going to go into the next parliament when the final decision is taken , i 'm going to say there 's no blank cheque , the costs have got to come down , the assumptions have to be robust			0
' if this is not a value for money project , it should n't be supported			0
i want to make sure the costs come down			0
we 've not seen the report yet			0
' we 'll support this because i think investment in new capacity is needed north and south , and to be honest have a bigger debate about what 's needed in the north and the current plans			0
' we 'll support it at second reading but we will continue to be vigilant , get the costs down , there 's no blank cheque from the @entity93 government on this project			0
' at present the cost of @entity6 is put at £ 42.6 billion , with a further £ 7.5 billion needed for the high - speed trains			0

the second phase , taking the line in a y - shape to north - west and north - east @entity66 , is set for completion around 2032/33			2
launching his report in @entity18 , sir @entity13 will say that he would like work to start on the second phase at the same time as the first phase			1
proposal : business secretary @entity44 ( left ) said there was a ' compelling case ' to extend @entity6 to the north as quickly as possible , while sir @entity13 ( right ) wants to bring the project forward he is also expected to recommend a completely new station at @entity11 , the site for the line 's @entity11 terminus			1
sir @entity13 , who has joined @entity6 after being @entity14 chief executive , is also expected to recommend scrapping plans to link @entity6 with @entity154 , the @entity11 to @entity157 coast @entity156 high - speed line			1
@entity6 is facing a number of obstacles over and above strong opposition by residents who face years of disruption while the building work goes on			0
