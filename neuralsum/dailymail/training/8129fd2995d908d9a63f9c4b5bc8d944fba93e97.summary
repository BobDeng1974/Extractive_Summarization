by @entity0 published : 20:37 est , 17 november 2012 updated : 20:37 est , 17 november 2012 thousands of police officers who retire at 50 are walking into well - paid civilian jobs at their old stations while also enjoying generous pensions			1
figures obtained by @entity6 show that at least 3,600 former constables , sergeants and inspectors are ‘ double - dipping ’ after leaving the front line while still relatively young then going back to work in the same forces			2
they can take up their new positions just weeks after retiring with a tax - free cash lump sum and an annual pension averaging £ 15,000			0
back to work : 3,600 police officers who retire at 50 go back to their forces to work as receptionists , crime - scene technicians and other related jobs			1
file picture altogether , they are earning a total of £ 73 million a year by becoming chauffeurs , call handlers , receptionists , crime - scene technicians and even dog kennel assistants			1
senior officers have also retired to take on top posts			2
they include @entity31 , a former deputy assistant commissioner at @entity33 who now runs the @entity34 , and sir @entity35 , another former @entity36 chief who became director of security and resilience for the @entity38			0
but the widespread practice is under threat as the @entity42 forces through plans to raise the normal pension age to 60 for police officers , in line with other public - sector workers			1
@entity48 , a @entity49 at the think - tank @entity50 , said : ‘ police officers remain extremely employable even after the average retirement age of 50			1
' given this , and in the absence of evidence that police officers have a lower life expectancy than the general population , raising the pension age to 60 would be a sensible approach to make policing more affordable in these straitened times			1
’ ' double - dip : @entity62 of the @entity63 says police officers should continue to draw a salary or their pensions , not both @entity62 of the @entity67 ’ @entity63 said : ‘ police officers retiring must either claim their pension or a salary if they continue to work for the force			1
' they should n’t be allowed to double dip and do both at taxpayers ’ expense			0
’ the majority of the 134,000 police officers in @entity78 and @entity79 are members of an old pension scheme that means they can retire by 50 if they have served for 30 years			2
they are entitled to a pension worth two - thirds of their final salary and a lump sum			0
those who joined after 2006 must wait until 55 to retire and receive half of their final salary			0
home secretary @entity90 wants to raise the pension age to 60 and increase officers ’ contributions as part of a wider shake - up of pay and conditions			1
these changes are being fiercely resisted			0
police say early retirement ages are justified because of the physical demands and risks involved in fighting crime , and that the public would not be kept safe by unfit or older officers			2
@entity106 of the @entity107 said : ‘ our argument has always been that it should be the best person for the job			0
i do n’t see any reason why police officers ’ employment opportunities should be restricted			0

*ex-police* officers work as dog kennel workers , chauffers and other jobs
practice under threat as @entity42 plans to raise retirement age to 60
