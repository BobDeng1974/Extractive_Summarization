by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale discarded @entity1 continues to haunt the @entity3 team despite playing his last test match in @entity5 seven months ago			1
@entity6 chose to announce the launch of @entity1 ’s autobiography next october , during the first test against @entity9 at @entity10			1
@entity6 requested media wanting to interview @entity1 to contact them already despite the length of time before the book appears			2
meanwhile , such is the interest in @entity1 that rival publishers @entity17 are bringing out an unofficial biography written by @entity20 cricket correspondent @entity19 , which will be in the bookshops next week			2
hanging around like @entity24 's ghost : the spectre of @entity1 continues to haunt this @entity3 team @entity19 , surprisingly sympathetic to @entity1 , reserves most criticism for the ‘ amateurish ’ way @entity3 managing director @entity28 went about explaining the reasons for @entity1 ’s exile			1
however the ripostes from @entity1 ’s preposterous flagwaver @entity32 , who described @entity3 ’s boss as ‘ @entity35 ’ on @entity36 , hit home hard enough for @entity28 , encouraged by wife @entity38 , to confront @entity32 at @entity40 earlier this summer			1
@entity41 was so supportive of @entity1 in his newspaper columns during the ashes that former @entity3 team director @entity44 phoned him to complain			1
yet perhaps @entity41 ’s truer opinion of @entity1 can be gauged from his enthusiastic high five greeting to @entity47 on the first day of the @entity48			1
@entity41 had not seen @entity47 since he called @entity1 a ‘ complete * * * * ’ while believing he was off air , commentating on the @entity51 v @entity53 match at @entity40			1
@entity41 was not the only one to support @entity47 ’s opinion as the ex- @entity3 captain frequently had his hand shaken at @entity10			1
close allies : @entity41 and @entity47 during their playing days the owners of @entity60 , the irreverent ball - by - ball commentary that has hugely upset @entity62 rights holders @entity63 , are considering legal action against the @entity65 on anti-competitive grounds			2
the @entity68 output has been off air since the ashes as @entity71 , who own the concept , consider their next legal step			0
meanwhile , @entity71 ’s staff are having to apply for their own jobs as owners , who include former @entity79 chairman @entity78 , look at extending outsourcing the content from 70 per cent to 100 per cent			0
football agent @entity81 , who received a six - month ban for breaches of third party ownership in the transfer of @entity87 from @entity88 to @entity89 , has had the suspension he described as ‘ completely out of proportion ’ reduced on appeal to seven weeks with a £ 15,000 fine			0
it allows @entity81 to participate immediately in transfer activity			0
he said : ‘ i was given a very fair hearing on a convoluted case			0
’ @entity99 businessman @entity98 was said by @entity101 police to be a fugitive after they attempted to re-arrest him in connection with the @entity107 @entity106 crackdown on @entity109 ticket sale abuse			0
@entity98 was not present when police arrived at his @entity111 hotel and they claim he was filmed by hotel security leaving through a back door			0
fugitive : @entity98 ( left ) was not present in his @entity111 hotel when police arrived @entity115 , who played five tests for @entity3 , is highly rated by @entity117 as a reporter whose pertinent questions get the best response from the players			2
yet @entity115 somehow evaded asking @entity122 , who was put up by @entity3 at the end of play to speak to the media , about the continued poor form of captain @entity127 — the major issue of the first test against @entity9			2
@entity115 , after gentle banter with @entity122 about bowling so many overs on an unresponsive pitch , said ‘ rest well ’ rather than risk a contentious subject such as @entity127 ’s form			0
out of sorts : it is now 26 innings since @entity127 hit a test century			0

@entity1 continues to *overshadow* @entity3 with publishers *sphere* *choosing* to announce the launch date of his autobiography during the first test with @entity9
@entity41 was so supportive of @entity1 in his newspaper columns during the ashes that former @entity3 team director @entity44 phoned him to complain
yet perhaps @entity41 ’s truer opinion of @entity1 can be gauged from his enthusiastic high five greeting to @entity47 on the first day of the @entity48
