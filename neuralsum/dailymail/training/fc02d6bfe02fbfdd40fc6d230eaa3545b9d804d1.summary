' but he said : ' using derogatory terminology , this slang , is not right at this level of politics and you should n't do it			0
' ' clearly what he said there is unacceptable			0
he 's apologised unreservedly , there are big mitigating circumstances , it 's from some time ago , and we 're willing now to judge him on his performance going forward from this			0
