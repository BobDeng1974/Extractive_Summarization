endangered @entity1 tigers show their power and grace in the water at @entity9 's @entity8 @entity7 took this series of action images while at @entity8 as a tourist @entity33 play - or fight - in the water at the sanctuary the park is linked to the @entity19 temple in @entity20 in western @entity9			1
@entity7 , 55 , of @entity22 , wanted to capture the young tigers up to mischief rather than laying about for tourists ' i spent a day visiting the temple as a normal tourist but was able to get incredibly close to the tigers , ' @entity7 says			1
' they were young and extremely playful , instigating some of the games with some of the monks who have brought them up , so they 're used to human contact			0
' @entity7 says he was able to get within touching distance of the tigers while they played together in their enclosures and watched them get showered and fed. ' it seemed incredible to me to get so close to these magnificent creatures , even to stroke them , ' he says			1
' it did feel slightly surreal taking these pictures being so close to something essentially wild and dangerous and to see their tremendous power as they run towards you			0
' my instinct told me to back away , but my urge to get strong photographs was telling me to get closer			0
' ' there has been some controversy over the temple as there is with a lot of wildlife centres , however during my visit the tigers seemed very well treated and looked after			2
' it was a magical experience			0
' one tiger surveys the area from the height of a rock , and prepares to pounce on its pals a tiger shows how tall it can be on two legs while two others clash with their huge paws simultaneously catching each other on the face nowhere to go ! this clash is n't going to end well for one tiger as the big cat with the higher ground strikes the other with its paw @entity8 , which was founded in 1994 , houses more than 100 tigers and visitors can bottle feed the cubs			2
in a review by @entity102 based on a combination of animal welfare measures along with media coverage and compiled reviews , @entity8 received an ' unacceptable ' rating of six out of a possible 50			1
a care for the @entity110 investigation in 2008 says it ' exposed cruelty and other serious issues ' but they say in recent years opinions on the attraction are divided			0
the @entity117 score was boosted by positive appraisals from @entity119 and @entity120			0
' it is obvious that many people love the @entity8 as it gives them the chance to get close to the tigers			2
many claim not to see evidence of mistreatment or cruelty , ' says the review			0
' however , focussing purely on animal welfare criteria , the @entity8 seems to deserve an unacceptable rating , as the conditions of the tigers is of extreme concern			1
