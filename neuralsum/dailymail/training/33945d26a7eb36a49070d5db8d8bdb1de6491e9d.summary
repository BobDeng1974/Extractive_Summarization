a mysterious crater that suddenly appeared underwater in southern @entity1 has baffled scientists			1
theories ranged from it being @entity5 art to a volcanic eruption – but now geologists believe there could be a simpler explanation			1
they claim it was caused a geologic condition called ' collapsible soils ' where refilling of a lake caused soil to collapse , creating a small eruption			1
@entity16 and his two brothers recently discovered a round hole or crater in the bottom of their irrigation pond on their farmland in @entity24 , in @entity25 , @entity1			1
the outer ring is a depression filled with algae			0
an inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath , forming what looks like a small volcanic crater this type of soil that can rapidly settle or collapse the ground is known as collapsible soil			1
' @entity38 soil ' is the most common type of collapsible soil			2
the term hydro – implies the introduction or presence of water , which is the case with the mystery crater			1
the pond has been drained and refilled more than a dozen times in the last two years			1
the theory is that the repeated loading of weight on the soil eventually led some of the soil under the pond to collapse , creating a small eruption			1
' as it collapsed and compacted , ' said geologist @entity57 , ' it forced some air and some water up and created this thing			1
it looks like a one - off thing			2
it just happened one time			0
' the crater was discovered last month by @entity16 of @entity24 after he saw an unusual hole in a lake			1
' the sun was just right , ' mr @entity16 said			2
' so , i saw this blasted thing that no one had ever seen			0
' he noticed it after most of the water was drained from the pond for irrigation			1
just beneath the surface he saw concentric circles in the pond bottom with a diameter of about 25ft ( 7.6 metres )			2
the outer ring is a circular depression filled with algae			0
an inner circle looks as though something erupted from beneath , forming what looks startlingly like a small volcanic crater			1
' my heck , i guess that 's @entity5 art , ' mr @entity16 said			1
' i do n't know			0
' experts from the @entity94 took a look and were initially baffled			0
' well , yeah , we 've got several theories , ' said veteran geologist @entity57 as he examined the pond			1
' most of them have gone up in smoke			0
' most of the theories were disposed of almost immediately			0
some had speculated that the feature was caused by a natural spring , pushing up from under the pond after being supercharged by recent rains			2
but mr @entity57 said that theory was quickly disproved by aerial photos that were taken before the pond was excavated two - and - a - half years ago			1
' this was an alfalfa field and there was no spring here , ' mr @entity57 said			2
' it 's not a spring			0
' the central depression is about 17.8cm ( 7in )			0
the @entity16 family were able to push the handle of a pitchfork another 33cm ( 13in ) or so straight down in the soft centre some had speculated that the feature was caused by a natural spring , pushing up from under the pond after being supercharged by recent rains			1
another theory was that a buried pipeline had been punctured during construction of the pond			0
but experts said there is no pipeline			0
scientists then proposed that there was a burp of methane gas from decaying organic material under the pond			2
earthquakes sometimes will cause similar features in sand or mud , due to liquefaction of soils			0
but there have no earthquakes in the @entity24 area powerful enough			2
the leading theory is a geologic condition called collapsible soils			1
it suggests that the repeated loading of weight on the soil eventually led some of the soil under the pond to collapse , creating a small eruption			1

another possibility is that there was a burp of methane gas from decaying organic material under the pond			0
mr @entity57 strongly doubts that theory because the local geology is n't the type that sometimes causes such events			2
' if we were in coal country , ' he said , ' i 'd be thinking about that a little harder but - you know - we 're not			0
' earthquakes sometimes will cause similar features in sand or mud , due to liquefaction of soils			0
but scientists have ruled that out because there have been no earthquakes in the @entity24 area powerful enough to trigger liquefaction			1
when mr @entity16 's son @entity191 was asked what his own pet theory is , he said the obvious : ' i have no idea			2
' another son joked that it was either a volcanic eruption or a @entity5 landing			1
during the geologists ' visit , mr @entity16 and his sons maneuvered a platform - lift over the crater to get a closer look			1
although the @entity204 saw a fiery meteor in the sky a few weeks ago , mr @entity57 has essentially ruled that out as the cause ; the sighting took place long before the crater appeared			1
and no one in nearby @entity24 reported hearing any loud booms			2
' we do n't think it 's an impact crater , ' mr @entity57 said			1
' we do n't think anything hit there			0
' hovering over the crater in the lift , the curious farmers and geologists lowered a tape measure into the crater			2

the town has a total area of 9.1 square miles ( 23.5 km² ) , all of it land ' obviously something came up and created this ring , ' mr @entity57 said			2
' but then it collapsed back on itself and closed off the vent			0
whatever the vent was is closed			0
' from those observations , a leading theory emerged : a geologic condition called collapsible soils			1

' that remains the most likely explanation , even though mr @entity57 said he has never seen such a phenomenon take place under water			2
' i mean , there are still some unanswered questions here , ' he said			0
' that 's for sure			0
' earlier this year , a series of mysterious craters appearing in @entity288 were found to have been created by methane gas , released by the thawing of frozen ground			0

@entity296 was discovered last month by @entity16 of @entity24 after he saw an unusual hole beneath the water

scientists looking at the crater in @entity24 , @entity1 , claim it was caused by a condition called ' collapsible soils '
the pond has been drained and refilled more than a dozen times in the last two years , causing the soil to give way
' as it collapsed and compacted , ' said geologist @entity57 . ' it forced some air and some water up and created this thing . it looks like a one - off thing '
