@entity0 has been told to remove the swing from her garden council bosses are forcing the mother of a special needs child to remove a garden swing - because the family did not have planning permission			1
@entity10 has decided to issue an enforcement notice because the swing had been fixed to the ground - which officers said made it a development			1
but mother - of - one @entity0 , who lives in the house in @entity19 , @entity20 , has hit out at the ' petty ' move			1
she said : ' i think it 's ridiculous and it 's like they are being anti-children and anti-families			0
' the rear of the property has no grass , it 's staggered , it 's got steps			0
the floor is covered with tiled slabs and it is not practical for a swing			0
' the mother - of - one has an eight - year - old daughter called @entity1 who has special needs			2
she said : ' she needs to be active			0
she needs somewhere to play outside			0
' there was ground pegs with @entity41 [ a blend of selected sand , cement and additives for fixing posts ] in place but it can be broken up with a spade and no one can even see it			0
it 's been outside for one year and now it 's fixed with nothing			2
' in july 2013 , a site visit was carried out in response to a complaint that a piece of play equipment had been located in the front garden , and the owner advised that it was temporary			1
on january 7 this year , the council received a further complaint that the toy was in the front garden and a letter was issued stating that if the swing was not fixed it could be considered to be temporary - but because it had been secured to the ground , it was classed as a development			1
a further house visit was made in march when officers saw anchor pegs and the cement had been used to secure the swing to the ground			1
during the council meeting on october 21 , councillor @entity76 asked for some common sense to be used			0
@entity79 said : ' what we are talking about is a child 's swing bought from @entity84 and as i understand it where it has been put would not constitute development if it had not been fixed in the ground with small cement footings , which is something the safety note which comes with the project advises to do			1
' the site is an end of terrace property which is set back from the main road and there is an open plan front garden			2
@entity10 has decided to issue an enforcement notice because the swing had been fixed to the ground - which officers said made it a development @entity79 said : ' i believe something as innocent as a child 's swing is not out of keeping with the street scene , but is in fact the thing we should be seeing in a pleasant family orientated residential community			1
' however , the question of whether this structure would encourage other families to place swings in their front gardens was also raised			2
@entity120 and @entity122 councillor , @entity119 said : ' we are all thinking it seems a bit mean to ask them to take it down			0
would it be alright if everybody had a swing in their front gardens , and that is what we need to be thinking about ? ' councillor for @entity131 , @entity132 added : ' you have got a swing today , a slide tomorrow and roundabout the day after			0
we need to take officers advice			0
' the enforcement action was granted by six councillors and miss @entity0 now has a month to remove the swing .			1
