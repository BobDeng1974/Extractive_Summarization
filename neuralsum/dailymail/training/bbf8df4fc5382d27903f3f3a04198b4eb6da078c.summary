by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 11:56 est , 29 august 2013 an artist fascinated by the effect the digital world is having on human interactions has published a short film of people 's last cell phone photos			1
@entity8 was blown away by how open and honest people he approached in @entity11 's streets were , sharing personal stories , some touching , some funny			1
from one night stands , to moments of natural beauty , an office picture to prove a boyfriend was at work and not cheating , to a bent - over stripper - the collection is a glimpse into moments in people 's every day lives			2
he said there was a certain ' irony ' that ' technology that 's trying to connect us more ... can also pull us apart '			1
for example , he said people on @entity49 may have hundreds of ' friends ' but have little human interaction and connection with them			0
mr @entity8 has been coming up with local interactive art projects in his @entity11 home for several years , self - funded and in his spare time			1
he has recently also completed a similar project , asking people to share and explain their last text message			2
artist @entity8 , pictured , said it was heart - warming how open and honest people in @entity11 were when he approached them in the street and asked about the last picture on their phone one man , left , took a photo of his van after it burst into flames when he and his friends were driving to a music festival			1
the silver lining he said was the kindness shown by strangers , who offered money and food ' both projects are based on the idea that we all have our phones on us at all times			0
most of us have smart phones so we can stay connected at any time			0
but the irony is , when you look around in a public space , half the people are on their phones , and it feels really isolating when people are not open to what 's going on around them			2
' mr @entity8 has urged others to follow his lead and expand upon the project , by asking people in their neighbourhood to share their last phone photo and explain the significance of it			1
in doing so he hopes to create more human interactions			0
he said : ' i hope at least there 's a dialogue about it , or it starts a conversation about it , ' he said , adding , ' i hope that other people go out and explore their surroundings			2
' this man , right , took a photo of the bracelets he sells			0
he said in @entity110 he is wanted in jail for making his bracelets on a personal note , mr @entity8 said he found the project ' gratifying ' since it 's rare for his projects , which focus on human interaction in the digital media , to get him outside and physically meeting people			1
many people he stopped in the street were happy to give him the time to share their last phone picture and explain it on camera			1
but some were too busy , and others , due to the content of the pictures , were not willing to share it			2
one man who did n't share his photo , but who is in the film , said it was a picture from a one night stand , of a woman who is now ' stalking ' him			0
another had a photo of a friend prior to going in for a face - lift procedure , and decided it was n't fair to make it public			0
evidence : a criminal defense investigator , right , sent a photo of his office , left , to his new girlfriend to prove he was still at work this woman shared a picture of her husband 's grave stone , which she took during a visit with her grandson and her son			0
she told mr cash her husband died five years ago but more often than not , mr @entity8 said he was overwhelmed by how cooperative people were and how they were so willing and open to sharing such personal information about snap - shots of their lives			1
one woman had recently visited her late husband 's gravestone and had taken a picture of it ; another shared a story about being high on mushrooms and taking a picture of a dead crab having pieced its limbs back together on a beach			0
a picture of @entity174 , right , was taken on saturday by this man , left , after an eight - hour drive from @entity177			0
he said the theme of the trip was ' never to fall in love ' which he did n't break mr @entity8 , who works as a freelance creative for advertising and technology companies , has invited others to watch his videos and create and share their own similar projects			1
check out mr @entity8 's latest interactive project and others he has done			1
this woman had a picture of her dog ' schnitzel ' who was excited in the car as she drove to the airport to collect someone			0
she said her dog always got excited on the way to the airport			0

artist @entity8 was blown away by how open and honest people were when he approached them to share their last cell phone pictures
some shared stories of taking drugs ; others shared moments of grief
mr @entity8 , from @entity11 , said he likes to explore how digital technology designed to connect people can also pull people apart
