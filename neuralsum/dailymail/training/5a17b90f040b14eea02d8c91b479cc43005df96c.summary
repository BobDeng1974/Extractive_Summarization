by @entity0 a dedicated gardener has spent a quarter of a century turning his ' blank canvas ' of a garden into an exotic jungle			1
@entity5 , who runs a software firm , has spent £ 10,000 and 25 years of his life transforming the back of his suburban @entity10 property into a lush paradise of foliage			1
it boasts more than 80 species of plants , including bamboo , banana trees and palms hailing from as far as @entity19			1
he said : ' when i first bought the house the garden was a blank canvas - it was just a lawn with a few old trees but now it completely been transformed and it 's totally exotic			1
' in my previous house i had the ambition to transform it but i just did n't have the space			2
' i 've always wanted to create my own little paradise , and i 've spent 25 years doing it			0
i 've got about half a dozen palm trees , all of which are hardened to survive in the @entity30			0
there 's also a number of different bamboo plants and some ferns			0
far from home : mr @entity5 poses above with a banana tree , which grows huge leaves every year , and sometimes even fruit - though it can not grow to ripeness in the @entity54 climate ' there are a few banana plants that flower and produce fruit every few years			1
obviously it is difficult in the @entity30 so you have to have a hot summer followed by a mild winter			0
' the rest of the family have to suffer ! they are n't big gardeners but they have to put up with what i 've done to it , but actually they really like it and they love spending time in it			0
' @entity5 , who lives in a modern detached house with his wife @entity74 , 60 , and their two children , brought the property in 1989 and decided to turn the empty garden into a vibrant jungle			1
he began planting a number of different palm trees in the garden , all of which are hardened to survive the colder climates of the @entity30			1
his impressive collection of plants include a variety of different bamboos , ferns , ornamental cacti and even banana trees			2
he also grows a number of unique @entity94 , as well as succulents such as @entity96 , a member of the pineapple family , and rice paper plants			0
conspicuous : this aerial view of mr @entity5 's garden dating from 2004 shows how his tropical project was well underway even a decade ago vibrant : mr @entity106 's plants , such as this golden bamboo , are usually found thousands of miles away maintaining the garden takes around three to four hours a week , with an extreme watering regime in the summer and construction in the winter			1
in winter months mr @entity5 , a father of two , builds shelters to protect the plants , enabling them to survive the cold temperatures			1
he said : ' in the summer the majority of my time is spent water the plants , that 's all you have to do to maintain them			0
' it 's a bit different in the winter , i spend quite a few weekends working , constructing shelters over plants and making @entity127 poly - tunnels			0
' i also buy about ten bales of straw which needs to be scattered around some of the more vulnerable plants to protect them from the wet , cold weather			0
' then when it gets to spring i have to allocate time to do the reverse process - taking off all the covers			0
' this is normally a good few hours a week worth of work			0
i probably spend a little longer than your average gardener in the back garden			2
' the biggest thing for me now is pruning - just making sure things do n't get out of control			0
carefully - cultured : the exotic blooms in mr @entity5 's garden need careful tending , and some spend the winter in a greenhouse humble roots : mr @entity5 's gardening ambitions began with a few humble palm trees , but became more audacious over time exotic : the puya plant , pictured , originally comes from the mountainous @entity156 , but can survive in @entity10 lengthy labour : mr @entity5 ( pictured next to a @entity159 puya plant ) , a 56 - year - old businessman , started transforming his garden 25 years ago mr @entity5 said the £ 10,000 cost of his paradise was made up of composts , fertilisers , and materials to build his shelters - as well as the plants themselves			1
he said : ' i would say i 've probably spent about £ 10,000 on the garden all things considered			2
' when you think about it i do n't think that 's too bad though			0
i think you can justify spending that on a hobby			0
' every year mr @entity5 opens up his garden under the @entity178 raising funds for charity			1
he has also won a number of accolades for his paradise , including runner - up spot in the @entity185 's back garden of the year competition in 2004			2
mr @entity5 's garden will next be open to the public on saturday 14 september			1
mr @entity5 's dazzling array of flora which have adorned his garden over the years number in the dozens and hail from all over the world			1
