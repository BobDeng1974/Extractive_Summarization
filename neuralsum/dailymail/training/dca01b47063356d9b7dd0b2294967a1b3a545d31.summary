house speaker @entity0 has employed an unusual tactic in his latest salvo against obama - pictures of @entity4			1
@entity0 ( @entity5 ) illustrated an argument attacking the president 's plan to fund community college fees for some students by imagining the pop sensation 's reaction			1
in an article posted to his speaker.gov website , @entity0 tried to turn voters against the scheme by showing a ' disappointed ' @entity4 falling out of love with the plan			2
the political leanings of @entity4 , right , are not known tax implications : posts were illustrated with moving ' gif ' images of @entity4 , such as the above , and said that the plan would cost taxpayers $ 60billion while the excitable singer starts out being thrilled by the idea , the 12 - part ' listicle ' then shows her furious at the funding implications of the plan - which @entity0 's staff say will cost taxpayers $ 60billion			1
the authors , members of @entity0 's staff , then observe : ' not even all the @entity4 album sales in the world would cover that bill			2
' continuing with a punning @entity4 reference , the next picture is captioned : ' still , 60 billion dollars is a lot of money ... you ca n't just shake it off			0
' punning : @entity0 staffers made a punning reference to swift single ' shake it off ' , with a clip from the video unhappy ? a seemingly disapproving @entity4 was the latest weapon turned against the president secret weapon : a @entity0 spokesman said the article is a ' fun , effective ' way to highlight @entity24 's failings she is later shown applauding @entity67 suggestions for helping people by cutting tax - and reforming early education with unspecified reforms			1
it is unclear what @entity4 would make of being used to make a political point			0
she refused to say who she would vote for in the last presidential election , despite intense speculation			0
a @entity79 post from 2008 on her page reportedly said ' @entity67 do it better ' - but she has since expressed support for issues , such as gay marriage , which align much more closely with the @entity85			0
hooray for tax cuts ! a later entry on the post suggested lower taxes as the ideal solution @entity0 's officer told @entity91 the listicle is an attempt to widen the audience for the speaker 's political points			1
spokesman @entity97 told @entity91 : ' we are always looking for fun , effective ways to communicate with the @entity102 people about president @entity24 's failed policies , and our better solutions			1
' as speaker @entity0 says : " you have to reach people where they are "			0
' @entity0 staffers have used similar tactics before , using shark pictures to highlight a jobs bill and images from @entity114 to draw attention to a stalled budget			0
representatives of @entity4 have yet to respond			0
meanwhile , the @entity85 responded to the attack piece via @entity119 , with their own picture of @entity4 labelled ' haters gon na hate '			2
@entity4 rebuttal : the @entity85 's official @entity119 feed responded with a @entity4 gif of their own			2
