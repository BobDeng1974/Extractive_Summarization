the jobless would be given financial help to move house to find work under a plan to tackle long - term unemployment			1
anyone out of work for more than a year would be given cash by their local council to cover the costs of hiring a removals van or paying a deposit on a home			1
the idea has been drawn up by the @entity16 think tank , set up by @entity19 @entity18			2
people out of work for more than a year could be given financial help to move to areas where there are more jobs under the proposal , the long - term unemployed would be given money if they land a job which is more than 90 minutes ’ commute from where they live			1
the @entity16 argues that people living on benefits in social housing are much less likely to be in work , and less likely to move to find a job			1
the plan will draw comparisons with @entity40 ’s 1980s suggestion that the jobless should get on their bikes			2
in 2010 , mr @entity18 sparked a row by claiming the unemployed should ‘ get on the bus ’ and look for work			0
he cited @entity46 in @entity47 as somewhere where people had become ‘ static ’ and ‘ did n’t know if they got on the bus an hour ’s journey they ’d be in @entity54 and they could look for the job there critics condemned the message that people had to move to new areas in the hope of finding work			1
mr @entity18 set up the @entity16 in 2004 , after standing down as @entity65 leader			2
he stepped down after joining the @entity67 government in 2010			0
however , the @entity16 insisted its scheme would be voluntary , and for many moving costs are a major barrier to taking up a job further afield			1
in a report published today , the journey to work , the think tank said the process of relocation for work should be made ‘ less financially burdensome ’			0
current rules mean there is little incentive for the unemployed to look for work in other areas where the labour market is booming			0
the plan has being drawn up by the @entity16 think tank , which was set up by @entity18 and follows his message in 2010 to jobseekers to ‘ get on the bus ’ and look for work @entity40 , who was employment secretary under @entity90 @entity40 has long been associated with the phrase ' get on your bike and find a job '			1
but the man nicknamed the ' @entity96 ' never actually said anything of the sort			0
the actual quote came in response to a question about urban riots which plagued places like @entity104 in @entity105 and @entity106 in south @entity107 in 1981			0
a young conservative had asked whether rioting was a ' natural reaction to unemployment '			0
the then @entity40 told the @entity65 conference : ' i grew up in the thirties with an unemployed father			0
he got on his bike and looked for work , and he kept looking ' til he found it			0
' the @entity16 said : ‘ we recommend the @entity121 pilots a relocation scheme to help with the cost of moving home for work e.g. hiring a removal van or help with an up - front deposit			1
‘ this scheme would apply to any jobseeker who has been out of work and claiming @entity132 for 12 months or more and has received a concrete job offer which would require them to commute further than what is currently expected under existing regulations ( 90 minutes each way )			1
’ the money could come from the @entity139 currently used by councils to help people claiming @entity132 and requiring more help with housing costs			2
the @entity16 calls for the plan to be piloted in areas of high unemployment			2
‘ to be clear , this is about supporting people to meet their ambition of moving , rather than forcing anyone to do so			2
‘ of course this has to be done in a managed way to prevent significant population imbalances , which is why this recommendation is deliberately restricted to the long - term unemployed with a concrete job offer			1
’ a source at the @entity156 said the plan was not being considered at present , but would be looked at by ministers			0
official figures show people living in social housing in @entity162 are more likely to live in financial poverty and less likely to be employed than home - owners or those living in the private rented sector			0
just 35 per cent of working - age social tenants are in full - time employment , compared to 65 per cent of private renters and 81 per cent of homeowners			0
tenants in social housing are also less likely to move , the @entity16 said			2
some four in 10 social renters have been in the same house for at least 10 years , compared to fewer than one in 10 of private renters			0
@entity177 , director of customer and @entity178 at @entity179 told the @entity16 : ‘ the cost of moving can be difficult for people to meet , particularly when they are moving to take up a job after a period of unemployment			1
‘ we offer assistance to residents with moving costs and we find that our support of £ 250 can make all the difference between moving or not			1

people out of work for more than a year could be offered council cash
@entity16 suggests fund to pay for moving costs
plan would not be *compulsory* and only available to people with a job offer
