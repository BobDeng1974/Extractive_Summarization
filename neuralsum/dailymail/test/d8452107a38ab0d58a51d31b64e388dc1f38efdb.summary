@entity0 is paying professional aid workers up to £ 1,000 a day			1
@entity2 has been criticised for ramping up aid spending @entity0 is paying professional aid workers up to £ 1,000 a day to work in @entity6 and @entity7 as part of a huge push to meet government targets on aid spending , it was claimed last night			1
spending on consultants has doubled to £ 1.4billion over the past four years and now makes up more than ten per cent of all foreign aid spending , an investigation revealed			1
hundreds of ‘ team leaders ’ working on aid projects earn at least £ 120,000 a year once the costs of their expenses , security and accommodation are taken into account , an investigation found			1
@entity27 rates of between £ 800 and £ 1000 are commonplace , the @entity25 newspaper claimed			1
the revelations will return attention to @entity0 ’s growing aid budget , which now accounts for some £ 12 billion of public spending a year			1
the @entity33 government committed to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid – and even passed legislation to enshrine the target into law			1
that target means that aid spending will increase every year if the economy grows , even if other areas of government spending face swingeing cuts			1
@entity2 has been criticised for ramping up aid spending while slashing funding for the police , defence and justice			1
the details of consultant spending sparked outrage among backbench @entity53 who have opposed the aid target			2
@entity57 , who is @entity58 parliamentary candidate for @entity59 said : ‘ when people think of overseas aid they think of people who have aid their homes damaged by an earthquake , a hurricane or a tsunami			2
they do n’t expect to be lining the pockets of consultant fat cats			0
‘ this is what happens when you are judged only by how much you are spending			2
how you actually spend the money becomes immaterial			0
it leads to grotesque waste and overspending			0
’ the @entity77 said it uses private sector companies as well as charities to deliver aid projects if they were the best placed to do the job			0
but officials insisted that spending on external consultants giving advice to the department had fallen			2
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity77 has slashed spending on external consultancy and advisory services by 98.9 per cent since 2009 , down to just £ 200,000 last year , but we rightly continue to use the private sector where it delivers aid projects on the ground that are effective and the best value for money			1
’ @entity99 widows queueing up and waiting to receive aid in @entity101 , @entity99 the @entity25 quoted anonymous ‘ insiders ’ claiming that private firms were making huge profits of 50 per cent on aid projects			0
a report in january by the @entity107 found civil servants at the department went on a £ 1billion spending spree over eight weeks to hit the government target			2
money was spent at the end of last year on humanitarian programmes but mps questioned whether the rate of spending meant it achieved value for money			0
the coalition aid commitment – meant @entity77 was required to spent some £ 11.46 billion in 2013			2
. but in june that year officials realised they would have to spend another £ 2.7billion in november and december to hit the target			0
months later that target was revised up again by another £ 1billion over those two months , taking the total to £ 3.7billion			0
the @entity107 report said the burst of spending that raised concerns the money was not used wisely			0
it said : “ given the limited time available the department could only choose activities where funds could be paid out during 2013			0
it may therefore have missed opportunities to get the best outcomes from this spending			0

spending on consultants doubled to £ 1.4billion over the past four years
