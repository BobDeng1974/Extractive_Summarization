@entity1 's @entity0 insist @entity2 would have been welcomed to @entity3 because of his skills as a dragon slayer he was a foreigner born in @entity6			1
but @entity0 has insisted @entity2 would have been welcomed to @entity3 because of his skills as a dragon slayer			1
today on @entity10 , the party announced that it would make it a @entity12 in @entity13			2
but at the policy launch , economic spokesman @entity14 faced questions on whether @entity2 would have been welcomed by a 3rd - century @entity0			1
in its election manifesto the party has said it would have a five year moratorium on unskilled migrants moving to the country			1
mr @entity14 said : ' well , i guess dragon - slaying is a skill but whether it is one that 's in short supply for the needs of the @entity3 economy , we will leave to our migration commission			1
' whenever the issue of @entity10 comes up - and i can predict this on @entity35 today - there will be many left - centre people who will tweet the fact that @entity2 was from what 's today known as @entity6 as if that is the start , finish of conversation and that makes @entity10 irrelevant or illegitimate or ridiculous			1
' i completely disagree ... i 'm not particularly hung up on where @entity2 came from			2
i 'm more interested in what @entity10 can represent			2
' the party said it wanted to encourage more people to fly the @entity2 's flag and end a ' cultural self - loathing ' about being proud to be @entity13			1
@entity47 , the party 's culture and communities spokesman said : ' for too long we have lived with a political and cultural establishment which has shown a sort of disdain for @entity13 which has doubted @entity3 has a whole and has discouraged pride in it			1
their embarrassment about our past , their lack of concern about our history has permeated our culture			0
' now many young people know little about the country in which they live			0
the patriotism of the many is often sneered at			0
we have a society that appears to live in a state of culture cringe			0
people have been encouraged to believe that national pride is exclusive , is dangerous , is bigoted and should therefore be discouraged			0
' he said that people who celebrate @entity10 should not be seen as ' racist '			0
he added : ' there is a sense somehow when it comes to a perfectly ordinary benign patriotism many people do feel that they are slightly concerned that if they say they are proud they are immediately going to be cast as racist , or bigoted or whatever			0
it is obviously completely untrue			0
' he said there was a ' snobbery about showing your pride in your country , that it is a vulgar thing '			0

he said : ' @entity0 believes in the @entity3			2
i do n't think there is any distinction between the right of someone from @entity106 and the right of someone from @entity13 to access public services			0
' @entity2 is thought to have born in in the late third century in @entity116 , which is now part of @entity6			1
he was a soldier under the @entity119 but became an early @entity121 martyr after he refused to take part in the systematic persecution of @entity121 ordered by the emperor			0
he was tortured and executed in 303 ad			0
