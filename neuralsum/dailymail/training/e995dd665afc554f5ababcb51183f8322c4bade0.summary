you ca n't afford a trip to the seaside in the hot summer weather - so you make your own swimming pool at home			1
that 's what these @entity8 teenagers did yesterday , creating a fully - functioning water park in the living room of their flat in the city of @entity14			2
with temperatures reaching an uncomfortable @entity17 outside , the boys used only ' polyethylene film and tape ' to transform their carpeted lounge into a swimming pool several feet deep			1
quite how they planned to remove the water out of the building remains unknown cooling off : with temperatures reaching an uncomfortable @entity32 outside , the unnamed boys used only ' polyethylene film and tape ' to transform their carpeted lounge into a swimming pool several feet deep taking a dip : they are seeing swimming together , posing with their thumbs up and diving beneath the water , while a thin layer of film covers their furniture and radiators the images of the boys went viral after being posted on various @entity8 - language social media websites last night			1
they are seeing swimming together , posing with their thumbs up and diving beneath the water , while a thin layer of film covers their furniture and radiators			1
as well as posts congratulating the boys ' creative way of keeping cool in the summer heat , there were others who branded them ' idiots '			2
' the water is about half a metre high , which means it is about half a ton for every square metre			0
i wonder if their neighbours will gather altogether to give them a good lesson ? , ' one said			0
' i hope the electric plugs are way above the water level , ' another added , while a third person said : ' i hope they cut their nails really well before going inside ... what if they break the film			0
' indoor pool : the images of the boys went viral after being posted on various @entity8 - language social media websites last night mixed responce : as well as social media posts congratulating the boys ' creative way of keeping cool in the summer heat , there were others who branded them ' idiots ' feeling the strain : one person posting on @entity8 social media about the images said : ' the water is about half a metre high , which means it is about half a ton for every square metre ' under water : it is not immediately clear if the boy 's had permission from the property owner to build the makeshift swimming pool , but given the risk of serious damage , it seems highly unlikely as well as the potential risk of the ultra-thin polyethylene film splitting or the floor giving way under the weight , another potential sticking point was how the boys are going to get rid of the water			1
such a large amount of liquid would normally require a pump to remove and it seems unlikely the teenagers would have ready access to such heavy - duty equipment			0
it is not immediately clear if the boy 's had permission from the property owner to build the makeshift swimming pool , but given the risk of serious damage , it seems highly unlikely			2
that may be reason why , despite being happy to pose for photographs , the boys have refused to reveal their names or the exact location of the flat			0
perhaps in an attempt to persuade their own children not to pull such a reckless move , one of the most popular responses to the images on @entity8 social media websites so far is the simple phrase : ' please , no one else try this at home			0

@entity8 boys came up with creative way of keeping cool as weather hit @entity17
covered furniture and electrics with a thin layer of polyethylene film
then flooded their living room to create a swimming pool several feet deep
