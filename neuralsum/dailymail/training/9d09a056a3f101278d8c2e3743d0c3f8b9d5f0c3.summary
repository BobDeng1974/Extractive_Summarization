the follicly challenged can now regain a full head of hair in a day thanks to the world 's fastest hair transplant			1
@entity4 went baldly into the record books this week - after undergoing the procedure in just 16 hours			1
@entity4 followed in the footsteps of football superstar @entity8 and @entity10 millionaire @entity9 to have the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) treatment			1
but unlike the celebrities , who underwent the process over a period of up to three days , @entity4 , 30 , had the hair transplanted in one single operation			1
@entity4 undergoing a record breaking 16 hour hair transplant			1
he spent £ 12,500 for the op and had 2,684 grafts carried out			0
the surgery works by removing thousands of individual hair follicles from the back of the head , where hair is usually thicker			2
the surgeon then uses very small micro blades or fine needles to puncture sites for receiving the grafts			0
placing them in a realistic pattern			0
the healthy hairs are then 're - planted ' them into thinning patches			0
the patient is awake during the procedure , having received a local anaesthetic			0
after the operation the hair will start to gradually grow and the full results will be seen in eight to 12 months			2
he spent £ 12,500 for the op and had the @entity12 at the @entity45 for the @entity12 which involved 2,684 grafts			0
the operation was a success and @entity4 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , who began to lose his hair in his early 20s , is looking forward to combing the results			1
@entity4 said : ' i ’m a pretty confident guy but i found i was beginning to get self - conscious about it			2
' it began to go at the front so i used to have expensive hairstyles to try to cover it but then it started going at the crown so i admitted defeat and shaved it off , but i prefer the way i look with hair			0
' the operation was n’t so bad			0
it hurt a little but i just watched a film and let them get on with it			0
' it feels good now and i am looking forward to it growing in and seeing the results			0
' i did n’t set out to be the first in @entity10 but it feels great that i am , and hopefully this type of surgery will be available to the wider public in the future			1
' @entity4 began to research having the surgery earlier this year after becoming fed up of his receding hair line			1
@entity4 shows his receding hairline before the operation ( left ) and after thousands of hair grafts ( right ) his surgery started at 7.30am and @entity4 did n’t leave the operating table until 12.30am the following morning			1
the surgery works by removing individual follicles at random from the back of the head , where hair is usually thicker , and transplanting them into thinning patches			2
the operation is normally done over two to three days but @entity4 ’s surgeons decided to complete the procedure in just one day , setting a new world record for speed			1
@entity4 ’s hair will take at least three months to grow in but he said he is delighted with the results so far			1
ouch ! the doctors were able to reconstruct a natural hairline from grafts taken from the back of the head the @entity45 was set up by businessman @entity102 , who launched the business in @entity10 after having the operation himself			1
the operation , which was only available in @entity106 and abroad until now , was carried out by dr @entity107			0
he said : ' it ’s been an extremely successful operation and we ’re delighted to be the first to have carried this out in @entity10			2
' our qualified and experience team have really set the bench mark high with this surgery in terms of achievement and results across the hair transplant world			1
the operation is similar to one undertaken by @entity8 - but over several days			0
' our aim is to change the perception of hair transplantation and educate those seeking a solution			0
' in @entity10 and across the whole of the @entity126 we need to create an awareness of the @entity12 procedure			2
' it ’s a revolutionary technique that is so advanced it has taken hair transplantation to a completely new level			0
' opening a clinic in @entity134 gives @entity126 patients an alternative to travelling abroad for @entity12 treatment and having to wait on long surgery lists			2

@entity4 had hair transplant surgery in just 16 hours
@entity142 said operation did hurt but he *distracted* himself watching films
the procedure took place in @entity134 and was a first for @entity10
