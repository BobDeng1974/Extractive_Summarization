@entity1 their way through an eerie twinkling landscape of cascading ice , these climbers dangled over some of the remotest landscapes in the world			1
the glacial scenes in @entity9 have been sculpted over the years by fierce winds and captured in these beautiful images during an expedition by @entity14 and @entity15 adventurers			2
photographer @entity16 , 37 , from @entity17 , travelled with 38 - year - old @entity18 from @entity19 and @entity14 @entity20 , 40 , as the trio were dwarfed by the huge structures with roofs as large as 15ft across			1
huge mushroom and cauliflower - like features are sometimes so vast they form horizontal roofs 15ft across , like an ice umbrella			1
the only way past them was to carve a hole or teeter around hoping it did n't collapse ' frozen in time : a mixture of volcanic ash and cascades of ice , the eerily blue landscapes are so vast that they are difficult to comprehend - or even depict on camera @entity50 : dangling over the void , @entity14 climber @entity20 lowers himself slowly down the side of an @entity9 fjord in a sport which can claim climbers ' lives mr @entity20 said : ' the wind in @entity9 is profound - it sculpts the ice like nowhere i have seen before			1

' it was a hidden playground for frozen enthusiasts , patterned with a network of ice capillaries waiting to be climbed			0
' after scaling the walls of a fjord in february last year , the team headed south - east to the five mile long @entity75 glacier and dangled from its side using their ice axes			2
mr @entity20 added : ' we drove across the south coast past lava fields and looming cliffs			0
venturing into the mist - filled darkness , i felt like we were driving across the moon			0
' flowing : while some of the landscapes are spiky and jagged , others , like the @entity90 glacier pictured , look almost like they have been held in a liquid state huge : the glacier is five miles long , not far from the @entity93 and popular with the tourists who visit @entity9 to see the loneliest reaches of the planet touching the void : as @entity20 edges his way along a wall of ice using an axe , chilly waters flow beneath him reflecting back the strange blue glow nation of ice : glaciers cover around 11 per cent of the entire surface area of @entity9 , with ice caps up to a kilometre thick in the most mountainous areas precious landscape : @entity9 is still mostly untouched by man , though its largest ice cap , @entity113 , shrank in size by around 5 per cent between 1958 and 2000 the formation of the 250 - metre thick glacier , five miles from the @entity93 , provided a new test for the adventurers			1
high winds in the region have carved huge chasms out of the ice , allowing the climbers to venture underneath it			1
he added : ' climbing on this transfusion of frozen water with ash was bizarre - like no other ice climbing i had ever done			0
' no matter how many precautions the group take , ice climing can be a dangerous business			0
in february a @entity136 tourist in his 50s died after falling into an ice cave on @entity9 's @entity113 glacier , despite venturing there with a guide			1
up to 40 rescuers had to wade in dangerously cold waters up to their waists to retrieve the man , but he was later pronounced dead			0
strange angle : an unusual view of @entity148 climbing on @entity9 's @entity149 during the expedition , which took place in february 2013 @entity1 his way through : @entity20 works to conquer the ice			2
he said : ' this transfusion of frozen water with ash was bizarre , like no other ice climbing i had done ' return to terra firma : @entity18 after her climb , left , and scaling the high ice sculpted by fierce winds of @entity9 's @entity28 , right @entity20 said : ' we drove across the south coast past lava fields and looming cliffs			2
venturing into the mist - filled darkness , i felt like we were driving across the moon '			0

the eerie twinkling landscapes were captured in @entity9 by photographer @entity16 , from @entity17
he said : ' the wind is profound - it sculpts the ice like nowhere i have seen before into huge mushroom - like features '
a 250m - thick glacier had *chunks* carved out of it by the elements and the climbers were able to venture underneath
