by @entity0 for the @entity1 civil servants are spending hours each week editing @entity4 pages on trivial subjects – including sir @entity6 and @entity7			1
comedian @entity12 , @entity9 football clubs and @entity11 paratroopers are among hundreds of other entries on the online encyclopedia that have been edited from @entity16 computers			1
since january , more than 600 @entity4 edits – more than two every working day – can be traced back to @entity18 computers			1
a 24 - year - old civil servant was fired in june after he edited the phrase ‘ you ’ll never walk alone ’ , the anthem of @entity39 , to read : ‘ you ’ll never walk again ’ on the @entity31 section of the site in 2012			2
now an investigation by the @entity1 has discovered that @entity16 computers have also been responsible for thousands of tweaks to more trivial topics in recent years			2
it will raise questions over how civil servants are able to get away with wasting so much time on an irrelevant activity			2
almost anyone can edit pages on @entity4 , which is the sixth most popular website on the internet , with nearly 500million unique visitors a month			1
one user tweaked the @entity58 wikipedia page stating ' i do n't think @entity7 conforms to the genre ' users can see details of any changes along with the ip address or user name of the person responsible			0
ip addresses are assigned to computers and identify the network they use to access the internet , which allows any editing to be traced , in this case to @entity16			0
in the past two days alone , the names of band members in @entity76 were added , an elton john page had a song title corrected and a list of horrible history episodes was updated			0
changes were also made to the page about @entity12 and @entity7			0
pages on @entity84 , curry , the @entity86 and presenter @entity87 were also altered			1
in the past month there have also been at least 15 changes to webpages for @entity9 football clubs			1
in the past two days alone an @entity6 ( pictured ) page had the spelling for song title @entity95 corrected @entity16 has previously been identified as the source of controversial changes of sensitive entries on @entity4 , including the @entity31 disaster and , earlier this month , the spare room subsidy @entity102 , of the @entity103 ’ @entity101 , said last night : ‘ taxpayers are n’t paying @entity16 mandarins to edit interesting websites , they ’re paying them to help run the country			1
‘ the clue is in the name ; civil servants are there to serve civil society , not to take it easy when they ’re in the office			0
taxpayers wo n’t be impressed			0
’ although anyone can , in theory , contribute to @entity4 , the site has a number of volunteer administrators who can remove false or inappropriate content			2
the content can be flagged up by other users for an administrator to judge whether it should be removed			0
a central committee appoints these moderators and senior editors			0
a government spokesman said last night : ‘ civil servants are required to follow the @entity133 when working online			1

more than 600 @entity4 pages have been edited from @entity18 offices
they include @entity9 football clubs , @entity11 paratroopers and trivial subjects
pages on @entity84 , curry , the @entity86 and @entity87 were also altered
staff must follow @entity133 when working online , said spokesman
