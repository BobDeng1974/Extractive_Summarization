even by football ’s frenetic standards , the rise of @entity1 from problem child to national treasure in under 12 months has been rapid , just like his acceleration on the pitch			1
a year ago this weekend , he was a late substitute for @entity8 in @entity10 ’s 2 - 2 draw at @entity11 , still to be entrusted by manager @entity12 as a regular first - teamer			1
today , it ’s a vastly different story			2
he is @entity10 ’s go - to man following the departure of @entity16			1
the undisputed centre of attention at @entity19 for saturday ’s tea - time kick - off against @entity21			2
@entity1 has scored two goals in three games already for @entity10 so far this season @entity1 slots home to give @entity10 the lead against @entity27 , a game they won 3 - 0 @entity1 scored @entity10 's first goal in their 2 - 1 win over @entity31 on the opening day @entity1 promotes @entity32 @entity1 is also the major cause for optimism about @entity36 ’s future			1
still only 19 but with plenty of life experience already behind him — he is already a father — @entity1 puts his fantastic form down to a conscious decision to be less inhibited on the pitch			1
‘ maybe 12 months ago , i would n’t want to get on the ball as much if i ’d made a mistake			1
but now i ’m a bit more confident , ’ he says			2
‘ if i lose the ball i want to get on it as quickly as possible and make up for it , whereas before i would hide away and maybe only look for the ball 10 minutes later			2
i do n’t want to give the defenders any break			2
‘ i sat down with my agent and went through my youth - team video footage			0
i saw that when i started , i ’d get on the ball and within two touches would turn straight away and look to attack my opponent , but when i got into the first team , i would go for the safer option			0
so i went back to basics where i needed to be on the front foot and the defenders on the back foot			2
’ in the flesh , you are quickly reminded this is still a kid , albeit one who has had an eventful journey to this point			0
at our interview at @entity71 to promote @entity73 computer game @entity32 , he appears nonplussed by the sudden wave of love being thrown in his direction			0
@entity1 was one of few positives for @entity36 at their miserable @entity79 campaign @entity1 slots home one of his two goals against @entity82 at @entity19 last season this is a lad who left his birthplace of @entity87 , @entity88 , to live in @entity36 at the age of five			1
growing up on a tough north - west @entity92 estate overlooked by @entity93 , his mum took him to play his first organised football game at the age of 10 , essentially to keep him out of trouble			0
one teacher told him starkly he ’d either become a star footballer or end up in prison			2
at 15 , he took the biggest decision of his life , to leave @entity102 for @entity10 and get him away from the malignant influences in @entity92			1
regular goalscoring is his next challenge and two in his first three games of the season for @entity10 suggests he ’ll crack that too			1
pushed to explain why his development has been so meteoric , he also points to a meeting with @entity12 around this time last year			1
he ’d just been cleared at @entity10 crown court of assaulting a former girlfriend when the @entity10 boss stated privately and publicly he needed ‘ stability in his life ’			1
@entity10 manager @entity12 and @entity1 talk during a training session at @entity119 @entity1 took a good look at himself , decided to stop going out every time friends asked and dedicated himself to being a professional			1
in december , he started to be given a run of games			0
he was unplayable when he scored twice in a 5 - 1 win against @entity82 in february			0
by the end of the season , his performances were regularly eclipsing @entity16 and he was the only @entity36 player to return from the @entity79 with his reputation enhanced			1
‘ going into training each day , coming home and going back to training			0
that ’s been it for me over the last 12 months , ’ he says			1
‘ i have tried to live , sleep and eat football as the manager has told me to do			2
‘ when the time is right , i have a laugh and a joke with my friends on a day off , but i have had to make sacrifices and in that sense it ’s been a huge step forward , completely different to how it was before			0
i was 18 when the manager spoke to me			0
i realised i ’m not like any other teenager			2
i ca n’t be doing stuff any other 18 or 19 - year - old was doing			0
i knew i had to make changes , to ensure being the best i could be			0
’ surprisingly , and a little unconvincingly , @entity1 insists he is not a naturally confident person			1
by that he probably means he would rather let others talk him up rather than do it himself			0
@entity12 told @entity1 that he needed stability in his life and to focus on football @entity1 and @entity16 celebrate during a game against @entity158 last season ‘ i am not saying i do n’t think i ’m good , but i ’m not the type of player to have an ego or big myself up			1
‘ it ’s been a quick turnaround for my career but that is football			0
i am now focusing on going to the next level			0
i ’m determined it is only a matter of time before i get there			0
’ it says a lot for his growing maturity that both @entity12 and @entity176 trust him to play at @entity177 , arguably the most important position on the pitch			1
@entity181 , for example , was much older before he was switched inside from the wing			0
‘ i prefer the no 10 position , but i ’m still developing and not quite the complete player to play there			2
‘ every time i get in there i try to take the responsibility of creating and scoring goals			0
he devised a diamond system for @entity36 ’s crunch game in @entity193 specifically to get @entity1 on the ball as much as possible			1
there will be a chance to compare @entity1 ’s progress with @entity181 and @entity198 when @entity10 play @entity199 in the @entity200			1
@entity198 , @entity181 and their @entity199 team - mates train in the @entity203 capital ‘ @entity198 has always been an idol to me , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ but i ’m not going to say any more because every time i mention a name , people say i ’m comparing myself to them ! everyone wants to be like the best in the world			0
’ while @entity1 keeps social activity to a minimum these days — ‘ i ’m not really a drinker ’ — he does allow himself one ‘ vice ’ , social media			1
‘ why am i on @entity216 ? well , i am 19 and need something to get away from football sometimes , ’ he smiles			0
‘ it ’s a way of having a laugh and a joke with my friends			0
you scroll past the provocative messages if they come in			0
’ @entity12 will be happy for him to carry on tweeting at least as long as @entity36 ’s most talented teenager carries on with his otherwise ‘ boring ’ life of home - training ground - home			1
@entity1 is a ‘ @entity229 ’ on @entity32 personality test			2
