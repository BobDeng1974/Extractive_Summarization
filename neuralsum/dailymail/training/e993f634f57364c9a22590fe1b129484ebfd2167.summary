by @entity0 published : 21:05 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 22:22 est , 4 december 2012 a @entity2 man has won a long legal battle to gain back custody of his 21 - month - old daughter after his wife placed her with an adoptive couple without telling him			1
@entity8 , 31 , will soon have his daughter back after a @entity11 judge ordered the girl 's adoptive parents to return her to him within the next 60 days			1
in a 48 - page ruling , judge @entity14 condemned the adoption agency that handled @entity8 's daughter 's case for refusing to disclose any information to him nearly two years ago when he learned that his child had been given away without his consent , according to the @entity22			1
@entity8 , 31 , will soon have his daughter back after a @entity11 judge ordered the girl 's adoptive parents to return her to him within the next 60 days custody : a fight over custody of this baby who was unknowingly by her father put up for adoption by her birth mother in 2011 has her adoptive parents in @entity11 vowing an appeal on a judge 's ruling to give her back the adoptive parents , @entity38 and @entity39 , have been fighting to keep custody of the baby , whom they call @entity41 , and plan to appeal @entity14 's ruling			1
on a blog about the case , where the @entity45 have raised more than $ 20,000 to help with legal bills , they described the arrival of @entity8 ’s daughter in their lives as ' a righteous desire blessed to fruition by @entity51			2
' ' we have not lost our conviction that we are in the right ! ! ! ! ! ! ' @entity39 wrote			0
' we have only ever wanted to do right by @entity41 , and have always felt we have been acting in her best interest to keep her with our family and raise her as our own			0
our hearts have demanded it — there has never been any question to us that she is ours ! ! ! ' @entity8 , a drill instructor in @entity2 , says it was just days after he left his pregnant wife for his new job out of state that she quietly signed over their unborn baby to a family of seven in @entity11			1
mr @entity8 says that he and his wife , @entity69 , were having marital problems not long after learning she was pregnant in 2010 , leading to her decision and his now spiraling struggle today despite a judge ordering the girl returned to him last october			1
the now ex-husband says ms @entity69 had suggested having an abortion or giving their child up for adoption - fearing she would end up as a single mother - but he said no , encouraging their daughter 's birth			1
new home : days after @entity86 gave birth to her daughter while her husband was working out of state , @entity39 , a @entity11 mother of six others welcomed the baby into her home knowing that the father did n't know about the adoption it was just months later in february of 2011 that mr @entity8 found himself sent to @entity95 in @entity2 for work , believing he ’d leave and come back a new dad			1
ten days after his move , however , his wife went gave birth to a premature baby and signed away their child before cutting all contact with her husband			1
' i was like , " @entity11 ? where is @entity11 ? " i ’d never been to @entity11			0
she 's never been to @entity11 , ' " mr @entity8 told the @entity22 of the moment he first heard the bizarre and horrifying news			2
sent to live with @entity38 and @entity39 , who had spent the last few years struggling to naturally expand their family of five children , the baby found herself in the city of @entity114			2
' we knew that we were not done having children , but after years of sudden infertility and several miscarriages … we discovered somewhere down the line that @entity39 had advanced endometriosis , and would not likely conceive or carry another child again , ' the @entity123 family write of their struggle in a blog aimed at raising money for their court battle			0
turning to adoption , in early 2009 the @entity110 grew their family by one more with a baby boy named @entity134			2
desiring to add one more child - ' a close , similar sibling ' for @entity134 - they found mr @entity8 's daughter , whom they named @entity41			1
' since that eventful day , we have , as a family , come to know that this dream was a righteous desire blessed to fruition by @entity51 , and that @entity41 would be that child - and yet , little did we know the challenges and trials that awaited us in finding and fighting for this little girl , ' they wrote			0
scared : the baby 's mother , @entity149 , pictured , told the family in @entity11 that she was alone and scared during her baby 's birth and was n't sure if her marriage would last the adoption agency , @entity155 , told the new family that mr @entity8 was n't aware of his daughter 's placement with them and that he would most likely contest it if he found out			1
the @entity22 reports that ms @entity69 had given the adoption agency mr @entity162 's former address in @entity163 for contact , knowing full well at the time that he was not living there			1
with the judge 's recent ruling , he noted the @entity169 family acknowledged the risk of the father 's upset but ' decided they wanted to proceed forward with the adoptive placement anyway			1
' kept in the dark throughout this with months of being unable to reach his wife , mr @entity8 asked a friend to visit her home in @entity163 who reported that the house appeared vacant			1
feverishly calling anyone who may know where his wife could be , while fearing she may have carried out the abortion she once threatened to do , he learned from a family doctor that his wife was no longer pregnant but they could not legally disclose what had happened to the baby			0
an ounce of relief only came to the horrified man when his wife finally called him in june , telling him she had signed away their baby to the @entity110			0
‘ i believe she felt guilty at that point because she just made a call out of the blue , ' he said of his ex-wife ’s phone call			0
once he learned of his daughter 's fate , he immediately tried to track his little girl down but upon contact with the adoption center they refused to disclose any information on her whereabouts			1
the agency told the court in october that it was standard procedure to not share any information with a father of a potential adoptive child when asked			1
missing : the baby 's mother admitted to giving the adoption agency an incorrect address for her husband to use as contact , preventing him from finding out about his little girl 's whereabouts for months ' i am not a very religious person , ' mr @entity8 has since told the @entity22 , ' but thou shalt not steal			1
' speaking of the drawn out legal battle , he said : ' if they prolong it , that is more time away from my daughter			2
there are precious moments i ca n’t get back			0
... it has been a year and a half now			0
there is no court order saying they have the right to my child			0
i just won the case			0
i want to get my daughter and raise my daughter , ' he said			2
judge @entity14 berated the @entity243 's handling as ' utterly indefensible			1
' ' this is a case of human trafficking , ' mr @entity8 's attorney @entity244 told the @entity22			0
' children are being bought and sold			0
it is one thing what [ adoption agencies ] have been doing with unmarried biological fathers			0
it is in a new area when they are trying to take a child away from a married father who wants to have his child			0
' when an attorney for the @entity110 contacted mr @entity8 , asking him to consent to the adoption , he said no and demanded his little girl returned to him - to the @entity110 's complete surprise			2
' over the last 19 months , despite the law requiring that a father show interest in his child and at least attempt regular communication to establish a bond , the father has never shown any interest in @entity41 other than to hire an attorney , ' the family writes in their blog			0
despite a judge 's order to return the child within 60 days , the family now asks that his parental rights granting him custody of her be terminated			1
they accuse him of abandoning both the mother and baby during her pregnancy and therefore demonstrating no capability for raising the girl			0
' the right of a fit , competent parent to raise the parent ’s child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and constitution of this state of the @entity296 , and is a fundamental public policy of this state , ’ said judge @entity14			2
he added that there is no law requiring the father to ' prove himself ' as fit to father his own child			0
' once mr @entity8 contacted the @entity155 ... to let them know he opposed the adoption and wanted his daughter back , that should have been the end of this case , ' said mr @entity14			2
not going down without a fight , the @entity45 vow to appeal the judge 's decision , asking friends and family to support their case financially through their blog			1
they note having paid for ' two already expensive adoptions ( each costing around $ 25,000 ) , ' with a continuing fight only requiring more money			0
their online petition has since raised more than $ 20,000			0
a hearing has been set for january 16 of next year on the child 's transition back to her father .			2
