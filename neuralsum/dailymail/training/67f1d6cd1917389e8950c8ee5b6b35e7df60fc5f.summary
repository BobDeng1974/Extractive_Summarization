@entity0 are playing a game of cat and mouse with @entity4 over @entity6 midfielder @entity5			1
the word from @entity8 on friday was that the club were no longer interested in @entity5			1
but 24 hours later there were suggestions in @entity12 that @entity0 raised an earlier bid of £ 30million to £ 35m			1
@entity0 also jetted off on a pre-season tour to @entity29 as soon as he took over			1
but @entity0 do believe they have secured the services of versatile @entity33 defender @entity32 for £ 14m			1
the completion of the transfer of @entity36 , though , is still in the balance over an issue with his visa and the complete severance of his third party status at @entity44			1
@entity45 is set to be at the centre of the most hectic activity on deadline day			1
options : @entity45 has been linked with several of @entity0 's @entity51 rivals during this window as revealed by @entity53 last week , @entity45 is surplus to requirements at @entity55			1
the player does not want to leave but will accept he has to move on for the sake of his career			1
@entity60 appear to head the queue and while @entity62 have been on alert , manager @entity59 said on friday that he thinks he has enough strikers			1
spurs would be prepared to pay at least £ 15m for @entity45 and @entity65 are still in the mix but the player may prefer to go on loan , giving himself the chance to revive his @entity0 career down the line			1
@entity71 are set to challenge @entity72 for @entity15 , another @entity0 cast - off , as the transfer deadline turns into its usual last - minute scramble			1
@entity75 : midfielder @entity15 ( left ) is another playing heading for the @entity0 exit door @entity77 could be on his way out of @entity60 with @entity79 set to make a bid			1
even though @entity77 has won his way back into the @entity83 set - up he will become surplus to requirements at @entity60 , especially if the club complete the signing of @entity89 ’s @entity88			1
mon : it ’s early doors but the manner in which @entity93 beat @entity94 suggest they are going to take some stopping to retain their title			2
i suspect @entity99 will provide the main sustained challenge			2
tue : @entity101 quits international football as predicted a couple of months ago in this column			1
in a few months , those who , bizarrely , ridiculed him over the course of his 106 - cap @entity83 career , will start to realise how good he actually was			1
weds : @entity0 finally unveil @entity110 having spent a @entity112 record £ 59.7m to lure him from @entity113 - a club he did not want to leave			1
is it a signing to significantly improve @entity0 as an attacking force when actually bolstering the defence is the priority ? or is it to boost shirt sales and enhance sponsor deals in @entity29 ? thurs : @entity123 hails surprise @entity83 call up @entity125 as the ' @entity126 '			1
fri : @entity129 general secretary @entity128 says ' we have go to rebuild some trust with supporters ' in view of the fact that @entity135 is set to he half full for the @entity138 friendly on wednesday			2
trust ? more like a decent team with an inspiring manager playing with some flair , urgency and passion , plus not being ripped off by high prices for tickets , food , drink , programmes , parking etc. then again maybe @entity128 is right to use the word trust			2
when fans are taken for a ride on and off the pitch they are bound to lose trust			2
@entity156 @entity101 's retirement from international football saw much debate about why @entity83 ’s so called ' golden generation ' ended up with the wooden spoon			1
bad management by the ridiculous @entity163 in particular as well as out - of - his - depth @entity164 and antique collector @entity166 are obvious reasons			2
predecessor to that trio @entity169 was pilloried but i have a suspicion he would have got more out of the talented wave of players that emerged at the turn of the millennium			2
i am convinced @entity175 would have , had he not been rushed out of office			2
a few months ago i was in @entity175 ’s company and we touched on what might have been post @entity180 98			2
he felt the future was bright given the players he had under his belt and those on the horizon and in general would have adopted a 3 - 5 - 2 system			2
a team like this could then have emerged by 2002 : @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity101 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199			2
with a young and sharp @entity201 to emerge and the likes of @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 around to bolster the above team then by 2004 or 2006 the so - called ' golden generation ' could have lifted big silverware			2
and the future now under an increasingly hapless @entity123 ? as it stands it would seem more like a @entity211			0
all over : @entity101 called time on his @entity83 career after winning 106 caps bowing out : @entity101 played his final game for @entity83 - the @entity27 draw with @entity215 i am hearing @entity218 's hierarchy are poised to use the international break to decide on @entity221 's future following a 3 - 1 home defeat by @entity89			1
i understand co-owner @entity223 is at breaking point and is beginning to think ' enough is enough '			0
@entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 are top of a long list			0
under pressure : @entity221 watched his @entity218 side lose on their own patch to @entity89 i am also hearing that @entity232 is on his way out of @entity234 - and soon			0
@entity235 and @entity236 are two leading contenders to take over			0
contenders : @entity235 ( left ) and @entity236 have been linked with taking over the reins at @entity234 @entity240 last week @entity240 recalled @entity83 ’s infamous 2 - 1 defeat by @entity138 after which the commentator @entity242 went on a wonderful victory rant			1
clearer in the minds of many will be the 2 - 0 loss to @entity138 in @entity248 in june 1993			0
it was one of the games immortalised on the @entity252 documentary about @entity254 ’s reign aka do i no like that			0
@entity254 is on the bench with yes - man @entity258 and @entity259 in @entity248 and the dialogue could have been scripted by @entity261			0
the @entity138 sequence ( at 29.20 of the clip below ) begins poignantly with a @entity254 press conference the day before the game when he talks openly , but euphemistically , for the first time about @entity269 ’s ' refuelling ' habits			0
it has been painful to see pictures over the past week as to where those ' refuelling ' habits have led @entity275			0
watch the footage below … it ’s likely to be more entertaining than wednesday ’s friendly against @entity138 at @entity135			0
btw it ’s easy to castigate uber - rich players for not giving fig about punters or just doing @entity283 charity stunts but @entity284 , the former @entity285 and @entity287 striker now pundit , pointed me in the direction of @entity65 striker @entity291			0
the @entity293 international bought four tickets for the @entity99 game and has given them to some unemployed locals			2
i gather he pays for @entity298 parties for the homeless in @entity94 and @entity300			0
gesture : @entity291 has bought @entity65 tickets for unemployed people in @entity94 @entity305 @entity201 ’s ' appointment ' as @entity83 captain raises the obvious question - why do we actually need to appoint a captain anymore ? back in the day when the @entity83 manager had a very small backroom staff the skipper became an extension of the boss with several ' managerial duties ' to perform			1
@entity317 saw @entity318 as his voice on the pitch , while off it @entity318 would often act as a conduit between the dressing room and the manager			0
@entity318 was also the head of @entity283 before there was even a press officer let alone spin doctors around			0
over to you , @entity201 : @entity201 takes the @entity83 armband following @entity195 's retirement many captains since took on the mantle			1
but the meaning of the role has dwindled given the layers of the backroom staff and entourage			0
it ’s good for the player of course			0
he stands to get even more sponsor endorsements			0
but for the team ? @entity123 says making @entity201 captain does n’t mean he is ' undroppable '			0
natural born leader : @entity318 was the @entity83 captain when the @entity83 ruled the world in 1966 let 's see			1
why not in future just give the captain ’s armband to the player who has the most caps at the start of the game ? as it stands that is @entity201			0
but from now on the position should be a symbol of seniority			0
not some sort of sinecure			0
@entity363 @entity93 have got the toughest group of the four @entity366 clubs in the @entity20 but i think they can get through it			0
so do most of the bookies who put them ahead of @entity62 and @entity94 to go all the way			1
it ’s worth then taking a punt on @entity71 at this stage at 14 - 1 with @entity375 to lift the trophy with @entity99 half that price			0
but given the final is in @entity379 and @entity381 football is on a crest of a wave , @entity384 at 5 - 1 looks a decent shout			0
@entity113 are 10 - 3 favourites			0
@entity386 @entity387 have made a £ 10m offer for @entity62 's @entity389 .			1

@entity5 could still end up at @entity0
@entity32 is on his way to @entity55 in a £ 14m deal
@entity36 's move in the balance *due* to an issue with his work permit
@entity45 should have options as he heads for the exit door
