controversial gas drilling did cause a series of earthquakes along the @entity5 coastline , a report today confirmed			1
gas company @entity6 , which is extracting shale gas in the region , commissioned the independent study after two tremors shook @entity12 coastline in april and may this year			1
energy chiefs have now sent a stark warning to the firm - either stop the earthquakes or be shut down			2
how shale gas is being extracted from deep beneath @entity5 @entity18 energy consortium @entity6 has discovered that @entity5 is sitting on one of largest reserve of ‘ shale gas ’ in @entity22			1
according to results from its test wells , there are 200trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the ground , trapped in a layer of compacted mud			1
if the gas can be recovered , it could provide @entity18 with enough fuel to last 50 years , plug the looming energy shortfall caused by reduced @entity36 gas supplies and create 5,600 jobs			1
and it could turn @entity39 from the leisure capital of the @entity36 , to the centre of @entity43 ’s oil and gas industry - a @entity45 - by - the - sea			1
two hundred trillion cubic feet is an unimaginably vast amount of gas			1
it is ten times more than all the gas known to be left under the @entity36			2
it ’s one - fifth the size of the biggest gas field in the world , and the volume of 66,666 @entity55			1
the prospect of 400 gas wells across @entity5 and thousands of new jobs - not to mention all those tax revenues - could n’t have come at a better time for the chancellor			1
but there is one problem - in gas and oil exploration , if something sounds too good to be true , it usually is			1
it comes after @entity6 held urgent talks with the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) to consider the report into the risk of earthquakes associated with ' fracking ' - the process used to extract shale gas			1
the meetings followed the @entity79 's conclusion that the two tremors felt nearby were most likely to have been caused by fracking			1
on april 1 , a magnitude 2.3 earthquake shook the @entity84			0
it originated less than two miles from an experimental shale gas well near @entity39 run by @entity6			2
a second tremor occurred on may 27 with a magnitude of 1.5			0
the epicentre was within 500 yards of the well			0
the @entity79 said the correlations between the earthquakes and the time of fracking operations , and the proximity of the quakes to the site , all pointed towards the earthquakes being a result of the fracking process			1
seismologist @entity101 said : ' these were still very small earthquakes , even by @entity18 standards and wo n't cause any damage			2
if fracking continued i could n't see the tremors getting much bigger			2
' but it is obviously a concern for local residents and i 'm sure the report commissioned by @entity6 will be greeted with interest			0
' @entity6 has came under fire from activists for its drilling technique , which involves pumping high volumes of water and sand into drill holes to crack the rocks so gas can be extracted			2
soon after the quakes were felt the firm halted the fracking process after admitting the low magnitude tremors felt in @entity126 in april and may , close to @entity6 's @entity128 site , could be linked to them			1
experts today said @entity6 's operations could be shut down permanently if proposed methods to reduce the risk of earthquakes fail			0
@entity135 , a senior @entity70 geoscientist , said : ' if we allow fracking to continue and their mitigation did n't work , then we would shut them down again , without a doubt			2
' there is a lot of concern in the media and from ministers about public safety			0
resort town : could the discovery of a huge amount of shale gas beneath @entity5 turn @entity39 into @entity45 - by - the - sea ? fracking is a mining technique commonly used to get gas or oil from under land rather than under the sea			1
to get the gas out , companies drill down into shale and form a well			0
they then inject wells with water , small amounts of chemicals and sand to create tiny cracks in the rock , allowing natural gas and sometimes oil to flow upwards into the well			1
the technique could add about 40 per cent to previous estimates of global recoverable gas resources , with the largest known reserves are in @entity174 , the @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			0
however , it is now feared the process could be the cause of small earthquakes			0
critics such as the @entity183 say that it is environmentally unsafe because the chemicals could contaminate soil and get into drinking water			0
' @entity70 has requested a detailed report from @entity6 , which we understand they are close to finalising			0
when the report is received , it will be carefully considered , with input from @entity79 and other experts			0
' we will also be discussing the report with other regulators before any decision is made on resuming hydraulic fracturing operations for shale gas			0
' last month @entity6 , the first company to explore for shale gas in @entity18 , announced the @entity12 coast holds a total potential resource of 200trillion cubic feet of gas			1
it estimated the discovery - between @entity39 and @entity204 - could be worth £ 6billion to the @entity18 economy and create 1,700 jobs locally			1
however , protesters are campaigning to stop the drilling and anti-fracking group @entity210 rallied outside the @entity70 headquarters on thursday as @entity6 presented its study			0
@entity213 , the chairman of the @entity39 and @entity214 , called on the government to halt all @entity18 hydraulic fracturing industry activity until there has been a thorough and robust evaluation of the risks related to future activity			2
he said : ' any suggestion of an acceptable level of earthquakes caused by fracking should be rejected			0
' the government must realise it must stop treating our communities like guinea pigs and accept these techniques carry unacceptable risks to the @entity18 public			2
' ministers must stop the industry activity at least until parliament and the public can be guided by a full and robust appraisal of the total risk to the themselves and to the environment			0
' @entity238 , ceo of @entity6 , said : ' we met with officials from @entity70 and their technical advisors and had a useful , in - depth working session on the initial findings of the report			0
' there is some considerable work still to do and we absolutely share with @entity70 the need to have the complex issues involved addressed dealt with satisfactorily			0

controversial ' fracking ' process *blamed* for tremors
there is an estimated 200trillion cubic feet of natural gas under @entity5
this is a huge amount of fuel - enough to power @entity18 for 50 years
