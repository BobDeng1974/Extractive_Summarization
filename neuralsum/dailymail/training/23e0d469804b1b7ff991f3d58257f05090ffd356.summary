around this time of year most squirrels are busy burying acorns and preparing their nests for a nice long sleep through the winter			0
but not these cheeky critters , who have been spotted doing the conga on the branch of a @entity10 tree			1
the three siblings , all from the same nest , were photographed by 50 - year - old @entity13 in his back garden in @entity15 , @entity16			1
@entity13 , 50 , a software support technician from @entity15 , @entity16 , spotted these cheeky critters doing the conga on a maple tree in his back garden the software support technician watched on , camera in hand , as the trio then turned around to face the opposite direction			1
after a few more seconds the grey squirrels glanced up at the higher branches before scurrying away after one - another			2
@entity28 are native to @entity29 , as well as eastern parts of @entity16 , including @entity15			1
the three siblings , who come from the same nest , formed into a line just in time for @entity13 to take pictures they have been introduced across most of the @entity34 and @entity16 now , as well as @entity35 where they are considered a pest because they compete with native squirrels			1
in @entity40 the @entity39 has almost competed the native @entity41 out of existence , and there are now programmes to trap and kill the grey variety to give the reds a chance of surviving			0
despite their name , @entity28 can actually be born with reddish fur , or even completely black			0
sitting 7ft above the ground the trio followed their brother 's lead as he suddenly did an about - face they have large , bushy tales which they use for balance , to keep warm in the winter , as a sun shade and as a means of communication			2
while they feed on leaf buds in the spring , with their particular favourite being maple leaves , at this time of year they mostly eat nuts and grains including acorns and beechnuts			2
they also use autumn as an opportunity to bury food which they will then dig up in the spring			0
the grey squirrels , @entity15 's native species , then did some more of the conga facing the other way before scurrying back up into the higher branches while they do lose some of what they hide , it is a misconception that they are regularly unable to track down their stash , and find about 85 per cent of what they bury using their keen sense of smell			1
they also sometimes eat insects , bird eggs and even , occasionally , chicks from a nest			0
they are preyed on by foxes , wild cats , owls and hawks			0
in the wild it is unusual for one to live longer than six years .			0
