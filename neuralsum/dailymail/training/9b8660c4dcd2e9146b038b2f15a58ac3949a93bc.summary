by @entity1 reporter the founder of @entity5 communism @entity3 died after being poisoned by his political successor @entity6 , according to a sensational new theory			1
@entity5 historian @entity8 , believes that while @entity3 was already in poor health having suffered several strokes , @entity6 may have finished him off after a bitter feud			1
@entity3 , who had initially supported @entity6 's rise to power , later began aligning himself with @entity13			1
theory : @entity5 historian @entity8 believes @entity3 , left , could have been poisoned by his political rival and successor @entity6 , right in notes dictated before his death , @entity3 criticises @entity6 's rude manners and ambitious nature			1
he even suggested that @entity6 should be removed from his position of general secretary of the @entity23			2
poisoning would later become @entity6 's preferred method for dealing with his enemies , @entity8 points out			2
he added : ' the funny thing is that the brain of @entity3 still is preserved in @entity29 , so we can investigate			2
' popular theory maintains that @entity3 died from the sexually - transmitted disease syphilis			1
@entity6 was reportedly furious after @entity3 aligned himself with @entity13 ( pictured ) his embalmed body still lies on public display in a @entity36 mausoleum almost 20 years after the collapse of the communist state he helped bring to life			1
mr @entity8 and @entity41 neurologist dr. @entity40 reviewed @entity3 's records for an annual conference at the @entity44 on famous people 's deaths			2
dr @entity40 put forward a separate theory , maintaining that stress or a family medical history could have accounted for @entity3 's death prior to his death , the 53 - year - old @entity55 leader 's health had been growing worse over time			1
in 1921 , he forgot the words of a major speech and he had to learn to speak again and write with his left hand after one stroke			0
a subsequent major stroke later left him paralyzed on one side and unable to speak			0
an autopsy found blood vessels in his brain were extremely hardened , results that have been difficult to understand , said dr. @entity68 , who organizes the yearly event			0
' number one , he 's so young and number two , he has none of the important risk factors , ' @entity68 said			0
@entity3 did n't smoke - he never let smokers near him			1
he also did n't have diabetes , was n't overweight and the autopsy did n't find any evidence of high blood pressure , @entity68 said			0
there was ' considerable suspicion ' among @entity5 at the time of @entity3 's death that syphilis was to blame , @entity68 said			1
however , family history appears to have worked more against @entity3 , @entity40 said			2
@entity3 's embalmed body still lies on public display in a @entity36 mausoleum almost 20 years after the collapse of the communist state he helped bring to life @entity3 was treated for syphilis using the primitive medications available at the time , and while the sexually transmitted disease can cause strokes , there is no evidence from his symptoms or the autopsy that was the case with @entity3 , @entity40 said			1
the @entity55 leader 's father also died at 54 and both may have been predisposed to hardening of the arteries			0
stress also is a risk factor for strokes , and there 's no question the communist revolutionary was under plenty of that , the neurologist said			0
' people were always trying to assassinate him , for example			0
dr @entity40 , who reviewed autopsy records and the leader 's clinical history , said toxicology tests that might have revealed poisoning were not conducted during the autopsy			0
reports from the time also show @entity3 was active and talking a few hours before his death			2
' and then he experienced a series of really , really bad convulsions which is quite unusual for someone who has a stroke , ' @entity40 said			0
the conference is held yearly at the school , where researchers in the past have re-examined the diagnoses of figures including @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 .			0
