sobbing , @entity0 , 16 , and her younger siblings blessing , 11 , @entity2 , nine , and @entity3 , five , can only watch as the body of their mother is taken away			0
dressed in hazard suits that cover them from head to toe , the men loading the plastic - wrapped corpse onto a truck are a grim sight			0
but they , like the plastic wrap that shrouds the body , are necessary for @entity17 , 45 , like thousands of others in her native @entity19 , died from the deadly ebola virus			1
tragic : with their grandmother @entity21 , @entity3 , five , and @entity2 , nine , watch as their mother 's body is taken away with 2,909 deaths and 6,185 cases of the disease reported in @entity19 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 so far , @entity26 orphans are , sadly , not unusual			1
but with neighbours and extended families reluctant to take the children in for fear of succumbing to the disease themselves , @entity33 says the future is bleak for the youngsters affected			1
' the large number of single - parent families in @entity19 means that as mothers are dying from @entity26 , children lose their sole care - giver , and have no - one to look after them , ' explains @entity46 , @entity47 for @entity19			1
' once their mother dies , the orphaned children have to leave school , if they were in school in the first place			2
' they are ostracised by the community , and they have to work , to try to make a living and support themselves			2
' upsetting : @entity55 watch as men wearing head - to - toe hazard suits prepare to collect @entity17 's body @entity59 : health workers in hazard suits carry @entity17 's plastic - wrapped corpse away after her death from @entity26 alone : with help from her grandmother , 68 , @entity0 , 16 , will now care for her younger siblings @entity26 has so far claimed 1,137 lives in @entity19 , according to the @entity69 , among them scores of single mothers who have left young families behind			1
since the civil war that ended in 2003 , the country has been plagued by social problems , with broken , one - parent families becoming the norm , as traumatised , unemployed men reject marriage and family values			1
now , according to government sources , up to 300 children are struggling to cope after losing their mothers to the epidemic			1
in @entity86 near @entity87 , an area particularly badly affected by years of civil war , an estimated 75 per cent of women with children are single mothers , while nationally , single parents account for fully half of the country 's families			1
it 's a situation that is all too familiar for @entity0 , herself a single mother of one , and her siblings , who live in the isolated village of @entity99 in northern @entity19			1
with four different fathers , none of whom are on the scene , and only their elderly grandmother to look after them , none have much hope for the future or faith in their extended family			0
all over : as her sobbing children watch , @entity17 's body is loaded into a pick - up truck and driven away harrowing : such is the fear in capital @entity87 , bodies of @entity26 victims are sometimes left where they drop terrified : with 1,137 already dead from the disease in @entity19 , people are becoming increasingly frightened ' we ’ve not seen anyone as a father since we were born , ' says the heart - breakingly grown - up @entity2 , nine			1
' we have not seen any family member before our mother died , besides our grandmother , ' she reveals			0
their grandmother , @entity21 , 68 , is doing her best to care for the children but , well into old age , is unable to work and struggles to keep up with her boisterous grandson			0
' i will find it difficult at my age to fully cater to these children , now that i am not working again , ' she admits			0
' i was one of many traditional midwives who the government forcibly retired , on the grounds that we were illiterate			0
i am also too old to do farm work or cleaning work			0
' @entity142 , terrified of succumbing to @entity26 themselves , have refused to help , which means that the bulk of the childcare now falls to @entity0 , who has had to leave school to take care of her siblings			2
ostracised : @entity17 's four children now face an uncertain future and have been ostracised by their neighbours help : the shocked and grieving children say they would like their extended family to come to their aid and with money tight , her younger siblings have also had to give up their education - much to aspiring teacher @entity2 's distress			2
' i ’d love to be a teacher in the future like my mother once was , ' she admits , ' but with all this going on , becoming a teacher will not happen			0
' worst of all though , is the social stigma that they now face following their mother 's death			0
' these children are really stigmatised by @entity26 , ' adds @entity46			2
' many families just do not want to help them after their parents die because they are scared of contracting the disease			2
but these children are in dire need of assistance			0
' ' extended families do n’t want to take care of orphans of affected parents or other vulnerable children anymore out of fear of being contaminated or stigmatised in the community , ' adds child protection specialist , @entity188			1
' some foster families have abandoned orphans after receiving the accompanying food and non-food assistance , leaving the children to fend for themselves			1
' as for @entity0 and her siblings , still struggling to come to terms with their mother 's death , the future remains uncertain			0
' i have my own responsibilities , and now that of my little brother and sisters , ' she says , adding : ' we ’d be happy to have any relative or family member come to assist us			0

an estimated 300 children have been orphaned by @entity26 in @entity19 alone
ebola orphans are often ostracised and left to fend for themselves
relatives and *neigbours* refuse to take them for fear of *infection*
half of @entity220 families are single parent thanks to years of civil war
in total , 2,909 have died and 6,185 have the disease across @entity226
