@entity0 : poet @entity1 had a string of short - lived relationships with various women before he died aged 27 in april 1915 poet @entity1 has long had a reputation as a ' young @entity6 ' , a symbol of innocent youth who was cut down in his prime during the senseless slaughter of the @entity12			1
but a new haul of previously unseen letters show that he was in fact a slightly caddish womaniser who had a string of affairs without ever settling down			2
the documents , brought to light for the first time thanks to a £ 430,000 grant , show @entity22 's lovers complaining about his refusal to take their relationships seriously			1
the letters are part of the @entity29 collection , which has spent decades in private hands but will now be available to the public after being bought by @entity32 , @entity33 , where the poet was a student			2
@entity22 , who died 100 years ago today at the age of just 27 , became a semi-legendary figure thanks to his early death and his popular poems such as the soldier			1
his obituary was written by @entity42 , who called him ' all that one would wish @entity45 's noblest sons to be '			2
however , the letters in the @entity29 collection - including 170 documents written by @entity22 himself - show a somewhat different side to the great poet			1
@entity53 's archivist @entity52 said that @entity22 was ' promiscuous even for a man of his time ' and carried on relationships with multiple girlfriends			1
' several women thought he was going to marry them - he may have thought that he was going to , ' dr @entity52 told @entity60			0
' i think he was happy to spend a lot of time with as many women as he could			0
' among the lovers whose affairs with @entity22 are featured in the letters are @entity70 star @entity69 , artist @entity71 , and @entity73 's cousin @entity72			1
lovers : @entity69 , left , and @entity71 , right , are among the women who had affairs with @entity22 popular : @entity22 became one of @entity79 's best - loved poets after his premature death @entity81 wrote to @entity82 , @entity22 's biographer , saying : ' i 've no intention of marrying anybody for years to come - nor , i hope , has @entity1 - though i should n't be in the least surprised if he settled in the wild with a squaw and a wigwam			1
' in another letter , she described the poet 's care - free attitude in the face of the danger he submitted himself to in the war			0
@entity81 wrote : ' when i talked of all things coming to an end he would always laugh and say , " hush - there 's never any end when things are perfect			0
" ' this is not the first time that @entity22 's reputation has taken a battering - previously discovered letters have shown him expressing unpalatable views on @entity108 and homosexuals			1
and this year a book about his affair with @entity71 revealed that he opposed the women 's rights movements and privately said that ' all women are beasts '			0
the pair bathed naked together near @entity118 , the village outside @entity33 where @entity22 lived in the @entity119 , now home to @entity121			2
trove : @entity122 of @entity32 with a haul of letters which the college has now bought thanks to a £ 430,000 grant home : the @entity119 in @entity118 , @entity129 , where @entity22 once lived if i should die , think only this of me : that there 's some corner of a foreign field that is forever @entity45			1
there shall be in that rich earth a richer dust concealed ; a dust whom @entity45 bore , shaped , made aware , gave , once , her flowers to love , her ways to roam , a body of @entity45 's , breathing @entity45 air , washed by the rivers , blest by the suns of home			0
and think , this heart , all evil shed away , a pulse in the eternal mind , no less gives somewhere back the thoughts by @entity45 given ; her sights and sounds ; dreams happy as her day ; and laughter , learnt of friends ; and gentleness , in hearts at peace , under an @entity45 heaven			0
despite the recent revelations , @entity22 has retained his image as a ' young @entity6 ' cut down in his prime , whose poems encapsulate typically @entity45 scenes			1
his poem the soldier , featuring the line ' there 's some corner of a foreign field that is forever @entity45 ' , was immensely popular during the @entity12 , and made even more poignant when @entity22 himself died while on active service on april 23 , 1915			2
@entity42 wrote in his obituary , published in @entity60 : ' he was all that one would wish @entity45 's noblest sons to be in the days when no sacrifice but the most precious is acceptable , and the most precious is that which is most freely proffered			2
' @entity122 , the librarian at @entity53 , said : ' it is hard to realise today just how significant @entity22 's impact was 100 years ago			1
' in the early 20th century as a poet you were fortunate to sell 200 - 300 copies of your work			0
just after his death , @entity22 's close friend and patron @entity82 published 1914 and @entity192			2
' the first edition of 1,000 sold out immediately and , in all , 160,000 copies were sold of various impressions			0
' he added : ' we now know much more about @entity22 as a person and he is certainly more interesting and , in some ways more difficult , than the heroic image portrayed at the time of his death			0
' he was a conflicted individual			0
he had a major breakdown in 1912 and had disastrous relationships with the women who loved him			0
' one of the letters now made available reveals how @entity22 's mother @entity208 sought to avoid turning her son into an icon , and also intervened to stop @entity82 inserting details of his more sordid relationships			1
@entity213 , chairman of the @entity214 , said : ' he was an interesting , complex and likeable person who is still suffering from the hostile backlash brought about by the " young @entity6 " myth created straight after his death			0

the poet has a reputation as a ' young *apollo* ' who died *tragically* young
new letters reveal he had a string of brief relationships with women
lover @entity69 *suggested* that he could ' settle in the wild '
@entity22 was *mourned* by the nation and *celebrated* by @entity42 when he died 100 years ago today
