' how to open a bottle of beer with a sheet of paper ' was uploaded by @entity17 this week , and it does exactly what it says on the tinnie			1
so the next time you forget a bottle opener you do n't need to worry			0
mr @entity17 's method is so ludicrously simple it 's a wonder no one has thought of it before			1
all you need to successfully crack open your beer is one piece of @entity28 paper			1
mr @entity17 who lives in @entity30 , @entity29 starts off by vertically folding the paper in half			1
he then folds the half lengthways again , pressing firmly so the creases of the paper hold			2
he keeps folding the paper in half vertically until he ends up with only a small amount of paper left			2
mr @entity17 starts by vertically folding a piece of @entity28 paper in half ( left ) before he folds it in half again ( right ) then he folds the remaining paper lengthways to create a ' v ' shape from the paper			1
he places the ' v ' - shaped paper against the underside of the bottle and applies pressure and with one swift upwards move he pops the cap of the bottle , successfully releasing the beer from its bottle - topped prison			1
the 21 - year - old @entity54 student said he invented the trick when he found himself at a party with bottles of beer and a broken bottle opener			0
he told @entity60 : ' i learnt the trick during the summer			0
' ' i was at a garden party with , tragically , a broken bottle opener			0
we needed to create some kind of bottle opener , and i thought that strengthening a sheet of paper by folding it could help it act as a lever to pry the top off ! ' after folding the paper thrice the forms a ' v ' shape with the paper he then places it on the underside of the bottle ( left ) and in one swift move pops the cap ( right ) success ! he has managed to open a bottle of beer without a bottle opener mr @entity17 said his trick will work with all types of paper , down to kitchen roll			1
on his account he explained : ' some people are pointing out that the paper looks thicker than standard paper			0
' it 's just high @entity96 paper printer that i happen to have at home			2
this trick still works fine with thinner paper , all the way down to kitchen towel			0
' his video currently has more than 350,000 views			1
