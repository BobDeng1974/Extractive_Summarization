mr @entity8 said : ' after about a week of collecting and building , i had a 21st century home , built from the discarded fruits of the urban jungle			1
' this sat at my studio for a number of months , just collecting dust until one rainy night , @entity49 , a homeless woman i 've known for some 10 years , asked if i had a tarpaulin for her			2
' i told her i did n't but as i went inside and walked past the home , it hit me , i should give her the house			0
' so i ran back out and told her to come back tomorrow and i would have a home for her			0
the next day , she and her husband @entity61 came round , i handed them the keys and a bottle of champagne and watched them push it down the street			0
' it felt so good that i started making another one that same day			0

' one cried and got on his knees to thank me			1
i think it is extremely important to help these people out as they keep getting moved by the city and need to relocate every few weeks			2
' this way , as the dumpsters are on wheels , they can be pushed around really easily			0
' although mr @entity8 pours his heart into making them , as soon as he gifts a house away , its future is in the hands of the new owner			1
sadly some have been stolen , burned or even sold but most of the recipients are still living in them			0

mr @entity8 said : ' tiny houses strike a number of cords in our society as they are n't just homes , but fast becoming a life style option			1
they are , usually , cheaper than regular homes , giving more people the opportunity of ownership			2
' small spaces means it 's easier to power an entire house with the sun or wind , and water can be collected and used over and again with simple catch and filtration systems			0
even black waste can be turned into methane and / or composite for food production			0

' if you built a home that followed you throughout your life , i bet you would be a bit more thoughtful in your choices			0
' so , in the future , we could all be living in dumpsters like @entity61			0
