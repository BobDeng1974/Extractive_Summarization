but @entity6 took to @entity12 to explain the difficult situation that the @entity14 found himself in			1
we are asked not to sign autographs until we have officially handed in our scorecards			1
' it was not @entity4 's only incident with a fan all day , after earlier growing frustrated with a spectator whose noise interrupted his backswing at the 16th hole on sunday			1
the three - shot leader hit an almost perfect drive down the centre of the fairway - but took exception to one member of the crowd , pointing them out to be ejected with his club			1

pressure building : @entity4 takes issue with the member of the crowd despite hitting an excellent shot @entity61 : the @entity10 champion alert marshals to the presence of the disruptive fan at @entity2 over the shoulder : @entity4 continues walking up to take his next shot but still wants to keep an eye on the crowd @entity70 handed : the spectator deemed to have offended by @entity4 is led away from the 16th off you go : @entity4 's request to the marshals seemed to be successful with this man being led away ' he was giving me grief all day , ' the three - time @entity77 winner said			1
' i sort of put it up for the first 15 holes , and then he deliberately coughed on my downswing on the 16th tee			1
' i still hit a great drive			2
but i heard it halfway down and i knew who it was			2
so i turned around and got him chucked out , thankfully			2
' i do n't know who it was			1
but i did n't have him bothering me for the last two holes , which was nice			1
' @entity4 managed to keep his emotions in check to win his third major , finishing two shots clear of his closest rival			1
and second - placed @entity98 also had issues with the @entity101 crowd , leaving the putting surface on the same hole to enter the crowd and have words with an encroaching spectator			1
the actions of both spectators were a big step away from the typical crowd etiquette , and both appeared to be ejected from the grounds at @entity2 on request of the two leaders			1

‘ missing the cut last year was a very low point as i never missed a cut at the @entity10 before			2
i said to myself that i ’d try to never make that happen again			2
‘ it ’s been huge what a difference a year makes			2
it was the worst of times at @entity162 but this is the best of times , ’ said @entity4 who dedicated his win to his mother , @entity141 , who was in tears by the 18th green			1
‘ to sit here 25 years of age and win my third @entity77 and be three - quarters of the way to a career @entity118 , i never dreamed of being at this point in my career so quickly			2
‘ the more i keep looking at this trophy and seeing my name on it , the more it will start to sink in , ’ added @entity4 who thanked the @entity101 golf fans for getting behind him , despite being a @entity172 supporter			1
