@entity1 's @entity0 and @entity3 @entity2 put on a united front today , as they stepped out for the first time since explosive new claims about the 47 - year - old monarch 's father emerged			1
according to a new book by a former royal correspondent , the former @entity10 had a long - running affair with a @entity15 socialite during the final decade of his reign			1
but if @entity0 and @entity2 were upset about the revelations , they certainly were n't showing it as they arrived at the @entity21 to present the @entity22			1
later , as a group of ukulele - wielding students appeared to serenade the royal couple , @entity0 even managed a small smile			2
well - hidden though any private anguish may have been , the news will have undoubtedly come as a blow to the @entity1 royal who has been attempting to overhaul the image of the monarchy in @entity1 since taking the throne			0
his father @entity10 was famous for his love of freebies , even , on one occasion , accepting a yacht called @entity46 as a gift			0
not good : a new book by journalist @entity49 ( left ) says @entity10 had a decade - long affair divorce : it also claimed that @entity10 contemplated divorcing @entity0 's mother , @entity53 unruffled : the @entity1 royal couple kept any worries about the allegations under wraps during the visit light relief : @entity0 managed a small smile while being serenaded by a group of student musicians in june 2012 , with the @entity1 economy in crisis and unemployment running at close to 50 per cent among the young , @entity10 was photographed enjoying a lavish hunting safari in @entity67			1
the trip , which was not announced in advance , only became known to @entity1 taxpayers when the 77 - year - old was injured and had to charter a special plane in order to get home			2
@entity10 ' @entity77 jaunt , a freebie paid for by @entity80 businessman @entity79 , led to widespread calls for his abdication , which he did less than a year later			0
since taking the @entity1 throne , @entity0 has introduced a new code of conduct which bans royals from accepting lavish gifts and also outlaws private business activity - the latter in response to a fraud scandal that enmeshed his sister @entity92 in 2010			0
he has also included a stipulation that insists members of the @entity1 royal family behave at all times in ways likely to ' please ' and ' earn them the gratitude of ' the public			0
blow : the scandal is a set - back for @entity0 who has been trying to change public perception of the monarchy freebies : @entity0 's new rules include banning all royals , among them wife @entity2 , from taking freebies behaviour : royals are expected to behave in a way that earns them the gratitude of the @entity1 public despite @entity0 's best efforts , his father 's legacy remains troublesome - in particular his record of extramarital affairs			1
most recently , a @entity124 woman named @entity125 filed a paternity suit against him - a case only made possible because of his abdication			0
@entity10 is also believed to have a second illegitimate son , @entity129 who was born in 1956 and lives in @entity130			0
the latest scandal focuses on the final decade of his reign with @entity133 , a @entity15 28 years his junior , claiming to have had a lengthy affair with the royal			1
speaking to @entity49 , a former royal correspondent and the author of a new book called @entity141 [ @entity142 ] , ms @entity137 claimed that @entity10 had contemplated divorcing his wife @entity53 in order to marry her .			2

@entity0 was making his first appearance since the claims emerged
new book alleges his father had a 10 - year affair with a @entity15 socialite
@entity133 claims @entity10 *wanted* to marry her
@entity0 , 47 , was joined by wife @entity2 , 42 , at @entity21
