fearsome : but a study shows that @entity2 's samurai warrior caste was brought down by a fashion for lead - based make up among their women the fierce samurai warriors of @entity2 feared no - one and lived in the hope of dying as heroes in battle			1
but in the end they were done for by ... make - up			0
researchers have found that children of the samurai class suffered severe lead poisoning because of the cosmetics used by their mothers and grew up deformed , disabled and backward			1
these handicaps left them unable to cope with political crises , leading to instability that led to the eventual downfall of their feudal system , the study claims			0
@entity27 of @entity2 's @entity28 studied the bones of samurai children and adults to discover their cause of death			1
based on chemical and x-ray analysis , the bones of the children in the study contained levels of lead dozens of times higher than both the male and female adults , the researchers told @entity45 ‘ s @entity47 magazine			1
' the median value for the children three years of age and under was over fifty times higher than that of their mothers , ' it said			1
white facial powder used by the women was the cause			0
' during the @entity59 , cosmetics became popular and the vogue was usually introduced by actors , courtesans and geisha , through prints and popular literature , and by beauticians who helped establish fashions , ' the researchers said			2
' the white face powders used in those days were made from mercury chloride and white lead			0
lead levels in the bones of adult women were roughly double those of men in the study			1
' and their breast milk was likely highly - contaminated , leading to the very severe lead levels in the youngest children			1
' the high lead concentrations in the samurai children of the @entity59 may have left them intellectually incapable of dealing with the final political crisis between 1853 – 1867 , resulting in the downfall of the @entity85			1
' a ruling class afflicted with brain damage is n't a recipe for success			0
as samurai were the ruling class , severe political insecurity could develop when highly lead - contaminated samurai children grew up			1
' modern geisha 's parade in @entity96 : but the fashion for pale make - up made with lead and mercury begun by their forebears in the @entity59 meant women from the upper echelons contaminated their children causing the youngsters to suffer a range of ill - effects that led to learning disabilities and behavioural problems according to the @entity112 , lead causes a variety of ill effects , and is particularly harmful to children			1
too much lead damages the nervous and reproductive systems , causes high blood pressure and anaemia , and accumulates in the bones			0
although lead poisoning was among the first known environmental hazards , from ancient times right up until relatively recently people were fond of its diverse uses and believed they could minimise the risk			1
many believed that limiting exposure would limit the danger to health , without realising that everyday low - level exposure to it made them vulnerable to chronic lead poisoning			2
the @entity135 used lead extensively in building aqueducts from about @entity138 to 300ad , despite @entity140 's engineer @entity139 reporting that ' water is much more wholesome from earthenware pipes '			0
it is even thought lead poisoning may have contributed to the decline of the @entity146			2
throughout the @entity148 , the metal continued to be widely used for a range of applications , but it was n't until the @entity152 that lead poisoning became common in the work setting			2
the introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead ; for millennia before this , most lead exposure had been occupational			0
toxicity in children from lead paint was finally recognised in 1897 and @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167 banned white lead interior paints in 1909 ; the @entity169 followed suit in 1922			0
however , in the @entity173 , laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971 , and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978			0
the 20th century saw an increase in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal			0
from the @entity180 , lead was added to petrol to improve its combustion and lead from exhaust fumes persists today in soil			0
the levels found today in most people are orders of magnitude greater than those of pre-industrial society			0
due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace , acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today			2
however , low - level lead exposure is still common			0
it is especially harmful to the developing brains of foetuses and young children , with it interfering with the metabolism of calcium and @entity204 and causing irreversible effects including learning disabilities , behavioural problems and mental retardation			1
at very high levels lead poisoning causes convulsions , coma and , eventually , death			2
dr @entity27 's team studied the bones of children who lived as far back as 400 years ago during @entity2 's @entity59 , when the country was ruled by a series of shoguns who presided over a feudal system upheld by the @entity223 caste			1
after sampling the lead in their rib bones and taking x-rays of some of the youngsters ' long arm and leg bones they found children with enough lead in their systems to cause severe intellectual impairment			2
those under three were the worst off , with a median level of 1,241 micrograms of lead per gram of bone - more than 120 times the level thought to cause neurological and behavioural problems			1
with global lead pollution much lower in the before the beginning of the industrial revolution , dr @entity27 's researchers surmised that the contamination must have been caused by the make - up worn by women of the @entity223 caste			2
his study showed that the women of the era had far higher levels of lead in their bones than men , and this contamination was passed on to youngsters while nursing			1
their analysis of the bones of those who did n't make it adulthood suggested that many who survived their childhood probably suffered from severe intellectual impairment , @entity265 reported			0
' we assume that facial cosmetics were one of the main sources of lead exposure among the samurai class because they were luxuries at that time , ' dr @entity27 told @entity265			1
' the lower class people ( farmers and fishermen ) did not have the luxury of using cosmetics and the laws strictly prohibited [ them ] from using cosmetics because they were workers			0

samurai women 's fashion for lead - based facial cosmetics *affected* their children through breast milk
study shows the bones of youngsters from @entity2 's @entity59 contained levels of the toxic metal dozens of times higher than is safe
effects of lead poisoning in children include learning disabilities , behavioural problems and mental retardation
