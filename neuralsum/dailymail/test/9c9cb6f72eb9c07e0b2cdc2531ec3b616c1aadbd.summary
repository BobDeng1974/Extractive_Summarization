tucked along the coastline of the second smallest country in @entity4 , the tiny fishing village of @entity1 is almost unknown around the world			1
but every summer , this sleepy backwater hosts the @entity7 of the fashion world , celebrities and more than a few millionaire playboys			2
staying in shabby chic cottages or sleek hotels overlooking the sea , they converge of the beach - a mass of honeyed limbs and perfect figures stretched out in the sun while planning where to party that night			1
the tiny village of @entity1 is an understated getaway for the rich and famous , filed with pretty villas and sleek beach huts @entity26 @entity25 ( left ) and @entity28 singer @entity27 ( right ) are among the stars said to have escaped the spotlight by holidaying in the chic resort of @entity1 so , what has brought everyone from @entity28 singer @entity27 to @entity26 @entity25 and restaurateur and playboy @entity35 - the man behind the glamorous @entity35 restaurants dotted around the world 's most stylish cities - to these shores ? wedged between oversized neighbours @entity42 and @entity43 , @entity40 has largely stayed off the radar for @entity46 and @entity47 travellers , but has long been a favourite summer spot for @entity4 thanks to its endless golden beaches and low prices			1
with an area of just 68,000 square miles , the country 's sizeable @entity54 coastline is home to pretty villages , two major cities - the capital @entity61 and the glorious colonial @entity63 town of @entity64 - while the interior is dotted with little more than estancia farms breeding cattle and growing wine			1
each summer ( during the @entity47 and @entity46 winter ) , @entity40 's beaches are taken over by well - heeled @entity43 and @entity42 looking for good food and sunshine			1
even the luxury boutiques selling trinkets alongside designer products are designed in the shabby chic beach style @entity77 is one of the most famous restaurants in @entity1 and a favourite with holidaymakers for its relaxed beach atmosphere as telenovela ( soap opera ) actresses and @entity88 film stars descended on the coast , one resort in particular became the haunt of the rich and famous			1
@entity91 , about 85 miles east of @entity61 , was soon known as the @entity92 , with sumptuous hotels , pop - up restaurants run by celebrity chefs and visitors ranging from supermodels and actors to company @entity99			2
there are so many celebrity homes in the area that there has actually been a bus tour launched , much like the ones in @entity107 and @entity108			0
and @entity91 even has its own area called @entity110			0
@entity112 has visited , as have @entity114 and @entity115 royalty , footballer @entity111 has a house nearby and even former @entity47 president @entity117 has stayed			0
locals and visitors stay understated in their beachwear ( left ) and the entrance of the village itself is posted with colourful signs by the side of the sandy roads the dark - tiled pool perfectly reflects the sky and blends in with the sea beyond at the exclusive @entity131 hotel while the golden beaches of @entity40 are the main draw for @entity42 and @entity43 visitors , but those coming from further afield may want to combine @entity1 and @entity91 with some other hotspots			1
@entity138 is perhaps @entity40 's prettiest town , with cobbled streets and crumbling buildings left over from @entity63 and @entity115 rule @entity138 sits across the @entity142 from @entity42 ( @entity143 is just an hour away by ferry )			1
owing its heritage to a mix of @entity63 and @entity115 colonialism - the two battled over its strategic location - it is a maze of pretty cobbled streets , bougainvillea - draped buildings and a crumbling lighthouse with panoramic views			2
the picture - perfect spot is does n't take long to explore but is ideal for a couple of lazy days strolling the streets , eating in patio restaurants and enjoying the atmosphere			2
the capital @entity61 tends to divide opinion among travellers			0
some blast the city for its high - rise buildings and lack of colonial charm ( at least when compared to nearby @entity64 )			2
but the quirky capital does have some of the buzz of its rival across the water @entity143 , with a beautiful 19th century market near the port crammed with restaurants serving asado ( barbecue beef ) and endless bottles of wine			0
the city has a necklace of beaches which come alive in the summer time with events and eateries and there is a faded beauty in the crumbling towers and @entity187 buildings of the city			2
tango bars and theatres have combined to give the city a reputation as a true cultural hub in @entity40			1
if you want to head away from the cities , then travel inland to the various estancias ( ranches ) that dominate the country 's interior			1
there is a good business in rural tourism here , with estancias offering stays to visitors - ranging from the basic to the super-luxurious - and the chance to ride gaucho - style on horses through the countryside , learn about their culture and tuck into the freshest asado beef there is			2
website www.welcomeuruguay.com has some options listed			0
with so many big names rubbing shoulders in one town , it is on wonder the ultra-chic crowd started to head elsewhere for some peace and quiet - which is how they happened upon tiny @entity1 , just 22 miles east along the coast			1
happen upon it on a quiet day and you would never know how popular it is			0
the tarmac road gives way to sand at the entrance of the village , pretty clapboard houses probably look more elegant than most , and signs pointing to chic boutiques and eateries are subtle			1
in the centre of the village is a simple square decorated with colourful flowers			0
there are no high rises , no gaudy luxury hotels , just an assortment of those shabby chic - style buildings that make the perfect romantic backdrop for fashion shoots - something which is not lost on the fashion directors of the world 's glossiest magazines , who flock to the area to create stylish beach spreads			1
the hotels in the area hide behind walls and fences , leaving them almost invisible to the average visitor , while at the same time showcasing spectacular ocean views to their guests , taking advantage of the village 's location on a peninsula jutting out to sea			0
the suites sit in individual huts covered in grass and wildflowers and the bedrooms boast spectacular views out to sea from the floor - to - ceiling windows the central titanium and glass structure was designed as a sculpture and the back opens up onto the terrace and infinity pool from the restaurant , guests can stroll out on to the terrace and sit by the pool which blends in with the sea beyond one such sleek addition is @entity131 , built by @entity285 - born hotelier @entity284 , it is a sleek modern design which should n't work with the traditional ambience of the village but somehow does			1
@entity288 offers a 17 - day @entity290 trip from Â£ 3,829pp			0
the trip includes return flights from @entity293 to @entity294 and returning from @entity295 , accommodation and sightseeing encompassing @entity294 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity143 and @entity295			0
@entity303 is based on two adults sharing a standard room on a mixed board basis and includes sightseeing with experienced @entity308 - speaking guides and transfers			0
an additional trip to @entity40 can be added into the itinerary at an extra cost			1
@entity313 and glass huts sit under grass roofs dotted with wildflowers , blending them in with their surroundings and are organised in a circle around a central grassy area			0
inside , huge stone baths and showers give the bathroom a rustic feel , while the huge bedrooms have quirky quotes scrawled across them ( a favourite is : ' may the fleas of a thousand camels infest the crotch of the person who screws up your day and may their arms be too short to scratch ' )			0
the floor - to - ceiling windows provide spectacular ocean views to those lucky enough to enjoy the end properties , and there are more chances to contemplate the seascape from the rooms on the top floor of the main building - a huge rectangular titanium and glass structure designed as an enormous sculpture			0
paintings hang on every wall , a cosy library gives way to a grand open room used as a casual restaurant throughout the day and evening , but the showstopper is the missing fourth wall , leading out to decking and a narrow infinity swimming pool , complete with dark tiling , which juts straight out towards the sea and is illuminated with star - like lights at night			1
by day , guests languidly swim while looking out to sea and across the golden sands and in the evening , the terrace is the perfect place to watch the sun go down while enjoying a glass of @entity40 wine			1
it may not be as famous as its @entity42 neighbour , but the beef and wine in @entity40 is just as fabulous ( just do n't say that to an @entity42 )			2
during my stay , bankers , fashion designers and movie executives mingle over fresh breakfasts , discuss their plans to explore further afield and generally create a convivial atmosphere so very different from the hugs nameless , faceless hotels often found at beach resorts			0
chic beach houses are the order of the day in @entity1 , with understated clapboard getting a modern twist and beach attire very much on the casual side @entity40 painter @entity389 created this fairy tale home @entity392 in @entity91 perched on a clifftop and looking out to sea - visitors can tor the quirky property today and learn more about the artist or stay in the part of it converted into a hotel @entity131 has been such a success that down the road @entity401 has recently opened , providing a grander , more traditional atmosphere with its luxurious ' farmhouse ' , but it has a similar atmosphere to its siter hotel , created by spectacular works of art on every wall , fantastic food and a personalised service ( i never meet a member of staff who does n't greet me by name )			1
for those looking for more than relaxation on the beach , the estancia offers the chance to ride horses through the countryside like a gaucho and take to the local rivers in a kayak			0
the best eateries frequented by the great and good are the stylish but casual dining options on the beach			2
@entity428 was set up by @entity42 chef @entity429 , serving fresh seafood and glorious salads			0
@entity432 is one of the most popular restaurants in town and opens with the same staff every year , serving only local produce and spectacular asados ( barbecues ) , while @entity440 also boasts a beautiful beach spot and has long been famed for its glorious barbecued meat paired with wines .			0
