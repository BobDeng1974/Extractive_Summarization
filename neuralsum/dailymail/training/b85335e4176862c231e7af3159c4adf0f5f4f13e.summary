' ( politicians have ) got to account for their actions , including your prime minister , ' @entity2 said			2
' i thought it was outrageous , the idea that you would n't send medical workers to @entity10			2
' ' this is just not the @entity9 that i know			2
' to think @entity9 's very far away and you can protect yourself by protecting the airports and the docks , it 's not very smart , ' @entity2 said			2
' you have to protect it at the source of the problem			0
these diseases do not respect borders			0
' earlier this month , @entity52 secretary general @entity51 reached out to @entity1 's frontman , asking him to join the fight against @entity5 by potentially holding a concert to raise money to battle the virus			2
he made the plea as it was revealed a trust fund he launched to provide fast and flexible funding for the fight against @entity5 has only $ 100,000 in the bank			0
the fund , which is part of a $ 1 billion @entity52 appeal for humanitarian needs in @entity39 , @entity37 and @entity65 , is intended to provide fast and flexible funding to respond to the medical emergency			2
' this is just not the @entity9 i know ' , @entity2 told 60 minutes of the @entity3 government 's decision to not send aid workers and medical professionals to @entity10 to help the fight against @entity5 the @entity74 last week estimated that unless 70 per cent of infected people were treated in the next two months , there will be 10,000 new cases each week , affecting potentially 1.4 million west africans but as it became clear its funds would do little alone to stem the spread of the killer virus , mr @entity51 revealed he was considering alternative measures			1
' i would welcome any initiative taken by mr. @entity2 or some other leaders around the world to join this campaign to mobilise funds and mobilise awareness to take urgent action all together and to show solidarity , ' @entity51 said			2
@entity2 is the founder of an anti-poverty foundation one , which campaigns to end extreme poverty and preventable disease			1
' i think we all saw this ( picture of ) this young kid lying in her own excrement and a load of people just standing around watching her die because they did n’t , they just knew not to touch her and she ’s lying there dying , ' @entity2 told 60 minutes			2
' these are very dangerous moments			0
' @entity2 is the founder of an anti-poverty foundation one , which campaigns to end extreme poverty and preventable disease @entity2 also took the prime minister to task for slashing the funds dedicated to proving foreign aid			1
' i know you 've got difficulties , every country does , and i respect them but i think the aid budget got 20 % of the cuts , so that 's a lot of lives , ' @entity2 said , speaking about the @entity9 's @entity120			1
' it just does n't strike me as being very @entity9			0

@entity135 president associate professor @entity130 is calling on the government to develop and announce a plan to help deal with the crisis but neither the @entity135 nor the chief medical officer know who the people are , what sort of training they 've had and whether they 're properly prepared			1
it 's not the @entity150 ( @entity151 ) teams that you would expect would be trained to do this work , ' @entity148 told reporters in @entity156			0
' who are these people ? if anything is going to be irresponsible it would be a last minute announcement about people who are ill - equipped or ill - trained to go and do this dangerous work '			0
' people should be reassured that the risk of transmission of that infection is very , very , low , but obviously it is a concern , ' he said			0
opposition leader @entity168 has also accused prime minister @entity3 of not doing ' enough to deal with this crisis '			1
' logic dictates that you 're better off dealing with the outbreak of a deadly and serious contagion closer to the source than waiting until it comes to @entity9 or comes to @entity65 , ' he said			0
' if you want to deal with a contagion and a disease which is deadly and spreads very rapidly , you 're better off dealing with it early			0
