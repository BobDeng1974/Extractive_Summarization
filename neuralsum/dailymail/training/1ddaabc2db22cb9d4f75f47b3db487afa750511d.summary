the prime minister met mr @entity3 in @entity10 at the @entity11 ahead of tomorrow 's d - day commemorations in @entity13			1
it came after mr @entity3 was warned that he has one month to end @entity4 's destabilisation of @entity8 or facing crippling economic sanctions			1
after the meeting mr @entity2 said he gave the @entity4 president a ' very clear and firm set of messages ' during the talks and said the current situation is ' not acceptable '			1
@entity2 today became the first @entity24 leader to meet @entity4 president @entity3 since the @entity8 crisis began the prime minister said : ' this was a meeting with a very clear and firm set of messages , which is that there is an opportunity for a successful , peaceful and stable @entity8 especially now there 's been a presidential election			1
' but the status quo , the situation today , is not acceptable and it needs to change			2
' mr @entity2 's aides said the meeting with mr @entity3 was a chance to ' look him in the eye ' and tell him his behaviour was unacceptable			2
earlier today at a hastily - arranged summit of the @entity43 leaders in @entity44 - which mr @entity3 was barred from attending - the prime minister laid out a series of steps mr @entity3 had to take if he is to avoid deepening international isolation			1
at a joint news conference with @entity51 president @entity50 , mr @entity2 said @entity52 needed to recognise the election of new @entity8 president @entity54 , stop the flow of arms across the border and cease support for @entity60 separatist groups			2
' @entity4 's actions are completely unacceptable and totally at odds with the values of this group of democracies , ' he said			2
' the status quo is unacceptable			0
the continuing destabilisation of eastern @entity8 must stop			0
' if these things do n't happen , then sectoral sanctions will follow			0
the next month will be vital in judging if president @entity3 has taken these steps and that is what i will urge president @entity3 to do when i meet him later today			2
' mr @entity2 , is the first western leader to meet mr @entity3 face - to - face since the current crisis			1
@entity4 , which had been due to host a @entity79 in @entity80 , has been effectively expelled from the group it has been part of for almost two decades following its annexation of @entity85			1
the prime minister said he gave the @entity4 leader a ' very clear and firm set of messages ' about its behaviour in @entity8 mr @entity3 did not appear particularly concerned about the prime minister 's message			1
the @entity4 leader has been barred from the @entity79 following his decision to annex @entity85 mr @entity50 urged mr @entity3 to ' seize the opportunity ' opened up by mr @entity54 's election in last month 's presidential poll to negotiate a diplomatic resolution the crisis			1
' we are at a point where mr @entity3 has a chance to get back into a lane of international law			0
he has a president in @entity54 who he can negotiate directly with , ' he said			0
' it 's clear that he recognises that @entity8 needs to have a good relationship with @entity4 , but also rightly affirms the right of @entity8 to engage with the rest of the world			0
' mr @entity50 also echoed mr @entity2 in warning that the western powers could not afford to allow the situation to ' drift ' and mr @entity3 needed to move quickly to show he was serious about finding a peaceful solution			1
' the mere fact that some of the @entity4 soldiers have moved back off the border and that @entity4 is now destabilising @entity8 through surrogates rather than overtly and explicitly does not mean that we can afford three months or four months or six months of continued violence and conflict in eastern @entity8 , ' he said			0
' we will have a chance to see what mr @entity3 does over the next two , three , four weeks , and if he remains on the current course , then we 've already indicated the kinds of actions that we 're prepared to take			2
' at a joint press conference earlier today , mr @entity2 and the @entity51 president @entity50 said @entity4 's behaviour in @entity8 had been unacceptable and vowed to hit the country with more sanctions while mr @entity50 emphasised the importance of the @entity43 allies marching in ' lockstep ' , he expressed his concern over @entity137 president @entity136 's decision to go ahead with a Â£ 1 billion deal to supply two @entity140 assault ships to @entity4			1
' i have expressed some concerns - and i do n't think i 'm alone in this - about continuing significant defence deals with @entity4 at a time when they have violated basic international law and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of their neighbours , ' he said			0
' president @entity136 understands my position			0
i recognise that this is a big deal			0
i recognise that the jobs in @entity137 are important			0
i think it would have been preferable to press the pause button			0
president @entity136 so far has made a different decision			0

came after @entity50 warned @entity3 that @entity4 would face new sanctions
