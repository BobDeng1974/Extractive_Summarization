the @entity0 refused to be drawn into a public row with @entity2 after the former @entity4 defender claimed he was denied the chance to become an established national team captain because the governing body is institutionally racist			1
officials at @entity9 were left stunned by @entity2 ’s remarks			2
not least because of the support the @entity0 has given to the @entity12 campaign in combating racism and the fact that the choice of captain has almost always been the manager ’s decision			1
in a new authorised biography , @entity2 , 39 , says : ‘ i believe if i was white i would ’ve been @entity4 captain for more than 10 years			1
it ’s as simple as that			0
missing out : @entity2 was capped 73 times for @entity4 but captain just three times rare : @entity2 was captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received it long term ‘ i think the @entity0 wished i was white			1
i had the credibility , performance-wise , to be captain			2
i was consistently in the heart of the defence and i was club captain early on in my career			2
i do n’t think it will change because they do n’t want it to			0
’ @entity2 went on to ask : ‘ are there elements in the @entity0 who are racist ? is the @entity0 always the leader of football it should be ? ’ he has been supported in the book , to some extent , by former @entity0 chairman @entity43			1
‘ it is more likely if he was white that he would have captained @entity4 more , ’ said @entity43			2
‘ i do n’t subscribe to the view that it ( the @entity0 ) was consciously racist but i think there is an assumption of a type of person who should captain @entity4			1
’ @entity2 also said he did not understand why former @entity53 striker @entity52 was made captain ahead of him			1
influential : the former @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 defender won 73 caps with @entity4 back then : @entity2 celebrates scoring against @entity60 in the 2002 @entity61 leading role : @entity2 says @entity52 was a great striker but was not captain material for the @entity64 in charge : @entity66 ( left ) and @entity67 ( right ) have been given the armband during a game @entity70 21 ‘ the more caps i won , the further away i seemed to be pushed from becoming captain , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i played well , acted honourably on and off the field , but there was little recognition			0
‘ @entity52 was a fantastic forward but nowhere near being a captain			1
i kept asking myself , what have i done ? i ’ve asked myself many times why i was n’t ( made captain )			0
i keep coming up with the same answer			0
it was the colour of my skin			0
’ @entity2 became the second youngest skipper after @entity61 - winner @entity70 when , aged 23 years and 248 days , he captained @entity4 under @entity85 against @entity86 in 1998			1
@entity85 gave him the armband again that year against the @entity88			0
his third and last game as captain was against the @entity92 in 2005 when @entity93 was boss			0
@entity2 played in an era when other black players have worn the armband , @entity97 and @entity98 among them			2
had @entity98 not suffered an injury shortly before the start of the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity98 would have been @entity4 ’s captain in @entity102 — albeit after @entity103 , who was originally selected ahead of the @entity105 defender , had been stripped of the captaincy			1
only recently the @entity0 came under fire when @entity108 , the first black and female member of the @entity0 board , pointed out that the commission appointed by new chairman @entity111 to conduct a review of the @entity114 game was exclusively white			2
@entity115 , the former @entity0 executive director whose time at the governing body coincided with @entity2 ’s 73 - cap @entity4 career , refuted the accusations			1
finally : @entity120 left - back @entity119 captains @entity4 against @entity121 in may after earning 100 caps leading the pack : @entity98 ( front centre ) is the only black player to be @entity4 's official leading captain @entity97 ... 7 ( inc 6 friendlies ) @entity2 ... 3 ( 3 ) @entity98 ... 7 ( 4 ) @entity119 ... 1 ( 1 ) @entity127 ... 18 ( 14 ) ‘ i am surprised by this because the reality is that in my time the managers selected the captain , ’ @entity115 told the @entity128			1
‘ i never — and to my knowledge nobody else in the @entity0 — ever sought to influence them			2
my belief is the allegations are wrong			0
i also have to say i am quite proud , along with a number of people of that era , of setting up @entity12 in football			0
i would love to talk to @entity143 about this concern he has about why he was n’t the @entity4 captain			1
‘ he clearly is upset about that time and he feels that perhaps he should have been , he would believe , more seriously considered as the @entity4 captain			1
’ a former team - mate with @entity4 and @entity57 , @entity146 ’s @entity145 was also surprised by @entity2 ’s attack			1
‘ i know @entity143 very well , ’ he said			0
‘ yes , he was deserving of being captain more often but i understand why he was n’t			0
i think @entity143 could have gone about this in a different way			0
we have to respect his view but he could have probably done something on the inside			0
we do n’t need this sensationalism and i do not know whether this helps any young black player coming into the game			0
’ asked if @entity2 would have made a good @entity4 captain , @entity145 said : ‘ yes			1
he was n’t very vocal , more of a visual leader but he was a leader			0
i feel disappointed this has come out in this way			0
he could have spoken to someone in the @entity0 and tried to explain his story			2
the @entity0 has to respond to this			2
' we have had black captains and this is dragging us back across a bridge we have already crossed			0

fa refuse to be drawn into public race row over comments
@entity2 claims the @entity0 is ' institutionally racist '
' if i was white i would have been @entity4 captain for 10 years '
former @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 defender won 73 @entity4 caps between 1996 and 2007
