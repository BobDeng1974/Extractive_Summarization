by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 05:27 est , 11 october 2013 two penises carved on a @entity3 wall , which were probably intended to protect citizens from evil spirits , have been discovered in @entity6			2
the 2,000 - year - old stone could reveal the origin of @entity9 , a city in the north of the country			1
archaeologists believe the phallic symbols could show a connection between the city and the roman emperor @entity17			1
two penises engraved on a 2,000 year old stone may shed light on the foundation of the city of @entity9 in northern @entity6 , revealing its deep connection with the roman emperor @entity17			1
they could also have been intended to ward off evil forces @entity26 , professor of archaeoastronomy at @entity28 's @entity27 , told @entity29 the penis carvings show the ancient city was built during @entity17 ' rule during the winter solstice			1
the carvings , plastered with mud , were unearthed during restoration work of one of the city 's old towers			0
despite being incredibly old , the stone can still be found where it was placed by a @entity3 builder - on the southeast corner of a monument known in the city as @entity47			2
archeologist @entity48 , who found the carved stone , said : ' originally , the stone stood in plain view			0
but in the early @entity53 the tower was probably flooded and its basis covered by alluvial material			0
' the block is carved on two of its faces			0
on one side a spade is carved over the penis			0
in @entity3 times the winter solstice was represented by a @entity66 symbol ( pictured ) and was also the emblem of @entity17			1
the archeologists said the @entity69 might have chosen the sign as it suggests the idea of renewal as well as the midwinter sun , which nicely symbolises a new golden era of prosperity while the other side is more damaged , it is still possible to make out another phallus , this time with a plough and a figure that might be a @entity66 , above it			2
according to the experts , the plough and spade both allude to the original trench ploughed to mark the perimeter of a new city , called the sulcus primigenius , which formed part of the @entity3 foundation ceremony			1
however , it is thought the pair of penises relate to the @entity92 and were carved to muster some sort of protection for the dwellers of the city , against forces of evil			1
the carving , plastered with mud , was unearthed during restoration work of one of the @entity9 's old towers			0
the @entity3 city is surrounded by the @entity105 , which can be seen in this image of a street while it might seem a shame that the carvings have been hidden from view for so long , the archaeologists believe they have been protected not only from damage , but from censorship			2
dr @entity48 said : ' in medieval times the evident phallic figures would have been erased since they were regarded as obscene pagan symbols			0
' interestingly , she said that the tips of the two phalli point to the south east , where the sun rises in the winter months			0
the sunrise would be in clear view from the tower , which stands at the highest point of the city			0
dr @entity26 thinks this is deliberate and that @entity3 urban planners factored in the complicated natural horizon of the @entity105 , of which where @entity9 's valley is nestled			2
the tower faces the sunrise on the winter solstice and dr @entity48 believes the city was founded on december 23 on the day that the sun rises in the direction that the phalli are pointing on the carved stone			1
in @entity3 times the winter solstice was represented by a @entity66 symbol and was also the emblem of emperor augustus - despite the fact he was born a @entity146			1
the archeologists said the @entity69 might have chosen to go with the @entity66 sign as it suggests the idea of renewal as well as the midwinter sun , which nicely symbolises a new golden era of prosperity			0
they suggest the city could have been built to reflect this golden age and sit in with the cosmic sign of @entity66 and the winter solstice .			1

archaeologists believe the 2,000 - year - old phallic symbols could show a connection between @entity9 and the roman emperor @entity17
it is thought the pair of penises relate to the *god* @entity92 , while a spade and plough carves in the same stone denote the perimeter of the new city
also a carving of @entity66 over one of the penises , which in @entity3 signified the winter solstice and was also the emblem of @entity17
