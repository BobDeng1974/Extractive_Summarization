click here to read @entity2 's match report of @entity4 's impressive victory at the @entity5			1
one of the many reasons for @entity4 's lean years in the @entity7 is their failure to do well against the really big teams			1
as such , this impressive victory at the @entity5 was one to buck a miserable trend			1
prior to sunday , @entity13 's team had not beaten @entity14 in the league since april 2012			1
they have not overcome @entity17 since october 2011 while , in terms of @entity19 , they have won only once since november 2008			2
@entity21 striker @entity20 celebrates heading in @entity4 's second at the @entity5 on sunday @entity23 leads the @entity4 celebrations after the @entity25 kept his cool to fire home from the penalty spot it is an astonishing record and says everything for the manner in which @entity4 have declined under @entity13 over the last decade			1
equally , however , it 's a run of results that helps to put this one in to context			2
this was , in truth , as admirable as it was unexpected			0
here in wintery @entity37 , @entity4 managed to produce a performance that contained much of what we expect from them and , crucially , some elements that we no longer do			2
@entity13 's team were as inventive in possession as ever			0
@entity23 was the game 's best player and , arguably , its most hard working			1
equally , @entity4 were rapid on the counter attack			2
@entity20 slides in jubilant celebration with @entity4 team - mate @entity49 on the way to three vital points here , though , we also witnessed a performance of tactical shrewdness – especially in the first - half – as well as some stout defending and a well - taken goal from a set piece			1
these are things that we do n't always see from a team that does n't always seem capable of learning essons			0
' @entity63 will tell how important this is for us , ' said @entity13			0
' but this win increases the level of belief and the five months that are ahead of us now are very important to the life span of the team			0
' the peculiar things about @entity13 these days is that his rhetoric constantly sounds like that of the underdog			0
it 's hard to think that this is the same coach who threatened to change the landscape of domestic @entity79 football when his team threatened the hegemony of @entity19 a little over ten years ago			1
@entity25 @entity23 kept his composure to fire @entity4 into a first - half lead from the penalty spot yesterday @entity4 were competitive in every way and deserved their victory , regardless of the validity of the penalty that edged them in to an important lead			1
when @entity14 had the ball @entity4 's midfield players closed the space in which the @entity7 champions ' more creative players like to work			1
equally @entity4 were resolute at corners – @entity14 had sixteen – and the statistics show they won 61 per cent of the game 's aerial contests			1
that in itself if a remarkable recovery by a team that defended so horribly in losing at @entity105 on @entity106 , for example			0
the obvious question now is whether @entity4 can maintain this			2
it is , after all , something that has proved elusive for a long time			0
the @entity4 defence was resolute throughout , defending well from set pieces and nullifying @entity14 's attack ' it helps that we have players back and fit , ' said @entity13			1
' from that point of view , this has been a very important period			0
' as odd as it was to see @entity4 win with a degree of comfort , here , so it was to see @entity14 struggle			1
this was only the third time since november 2010 that @entity14 have failed to score in a home league game			1
previously it happened against @entity130 this season and @entity17 last			0
they did have opportunities and on other occasions one would probably have gone in			0
having said that , it is not unusual to see them struggle for persistent and progressive possession against teams with centrally creative players			0
@entity14 manager , prowling the touchline on sunday , failed to keep his side on the heels of @entity17 in recent times , they have laboured here against @entity147 , @entity17 , @entity148 and even as @entity149 , for example , and there are occasions when the @entity154 central duo of @entity155 and @entity156 look a little short			2
certainly , it does not bode well for the resumption of their @entity160 campaign next month			0
on sunday , @entity23 and @entity161 passed the ball through the heart of the @entity14 midfield too easily			1
as such , @entity165 and the returning @entity166 found themselves exposed to @entity4 's runners			2
both had rather uncomfortable afternoons			0
last night @entity171 and his squad flew to @entity173 for a week of warm weather training and a friendly against @entity176			0
beyond that , though , the champions have a home @entity180 tie against @entity182 and then , ominously , a league encounter at @entity17			0
@entity14 players look down beat during the comprehensive 2 - 0 home defeat to @entity4 on sunday lose that one and @entity14 will have it all on to retain their title , regardless of the return of new signing @entity191 later next month			1
city are well in this race and are the kind of team that are capable of winning game after game , as they showed in winning eleven out of twelve prior to their recent draw at @entity202			0
one feels , though , that they must take a point from @entity17 at least to ensure two horses remain involved in this season 's title race			2
that is a contest in which @entity4 were never likely to play a part , of course , but a place in the top four remains a feasible objective .			2
