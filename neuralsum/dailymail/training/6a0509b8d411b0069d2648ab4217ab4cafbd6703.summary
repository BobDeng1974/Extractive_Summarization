by @entity0 published : 18:52 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 09:25 est , 22 april 2013 yearning : @entity2 never had children because art comes first @entity2 never had children because her desire to be a successful artist overrode any maternal feelings			1
in an interview for today ’s @entity9 , @entity10 , 49 , best known for @entity11 – featuring bed linen stained with bodily secretions – tells @entity14 she would have resented having to leave her studio to look after children			1
@entity10 , who had an abortion at he age of 26 and has never married , said : ‘ it ’s not because i did n’t meet anyone ; if i wanted to have a baby , i could ’ve			1
‘ i did n’t want to because the creative yearning and wanting to be an artist far overrode the physical feelings of wanting to be a mother			1
the mother who is the ceo of the company or whatever ca n’t wait to get home and see her children			1
‘ the mother who ’s in the studio painting will resent going home to her children			1
’ the multi-millionaire artist , who has homes in @entity35 and @entity36 , added : ‘ when people have children , they have a sense of purpose			1
‘ when you do n’t have children you have to define and make your own purpose , and make your own reason for being here			1
‘ i ’d like to think i inspire young people to be creative			1
’ @entity10 also admitted she worried about growing old			1
‘ i ’m nearly 50 and that ’s where i am , ’ she said			1
‘ i know i ’m supposed to say ageing does n’t bother me , then suddenly you ’re like , “ yeah , i care about it , i really worry about it			1
i ’m old ! ” ’ @entity10 , who made her name as one of the original @entity56 with the likes of @entity58 in the @entity59 , said she wanted to carry on working for as long as possible and is trying to curb her drinking to stop her brain turning into ‘ mush ’			1
she said : ‘ i feel physically ill if i do n’t make work , i do n’t create			1
‘ hopefully the last bit of me to go will be my brain			1
memorable : one of the artist 's most famous pieces is my bed , an installation featuring bed linen stained with bodily secretions ‘ for the future , drinking is a big question mark			1
‘ it ’s not being holier than thou , it ’s that i know what i ’d rather be doing when i ’m 95			1
‘ and it would be so stupid not to be able to do that because my brain had gone to mush			1
’ @entity10 also revealed that she will leave her estate to animal charities , a children ’s library she set up in @entity88 and @entity89 charity the @entity91			1
from wild @entity56 to @entity92 , @entity2 has evoked acclaim and controversy for nearly two decades			1
@entity96 's most provocative artist opens up to @entity96 's most controversial columnist ... i 'm in @entity2 ’s @entity100 studio			1
it ’s so big , on four floors , you could park an aeroplane in here , yet it ’s full to the rafters with works of art in wooden crates , canvases in floor - to - ceiling cubbyholes , a huge desk covered in neat rows of tubes of oil paint ( and i thought she ’d be messy )			1
there are two works in progress : sculptures of her beloved cat docket , asleep in the shape of a comma			1
it ’s so very much a cat , you feel you want to stroke it			2
one day , 100 years from now , i say , as @entity2 appears , all honed thighs and knee boots , a jaunty scarf over a jumper , hair expensively dyed and in a neat ponytail ( she eschewed our offer of hair , make - up and stylist ) , this will all be preserved in aspic			2
there ’s enough here to fill a museum			2
does she worry she ’s producing too much ? ‘ does n’t happen			2
when @entity147 died he had over 2,000 drawings , 500 paintings and 1,000 watercolours in his house			2
’ does she work all the time ? ‘ i can sit here and sew while talking to you , but that ’s not work , it ’s production			2
me working is me experimenting , me trying something new , me doing something badly but seeing something good in it , having time to open stuff up and reinvent things			2
’ does she feel guilty if she is n’t working , could quickly become out of practice , maybe ? ‘ i feel physically ill if i do n’t make work , i do n’t create			2
i do n’t feel very good , i do n’t feel right , i feel wrong			2
’ she sounds a perfectionist , disciplined			2
‘ sometimes magic things happen ; it ’s just something within the process			2
i do n’t like it when the drawings get too neat			0
it looks like a machine ’s done them , so it ’s no good , it ’s got to be real , you know ? i ’m disciplined in the fact that i get everything done but i ’m prone to change my mind on things			0
‘ i ’ve planned my death , what happens afterwards			0
as an artist you have to , otherwise what would happen ? it would just be such a mess , would n’t it ? ' one thing about an artist , it does n’t matter how much your work sells for in your life , it ’s going to sell for ten times more than that after you ’re dead , and that ’s what you have to protect			0
’ ' i would n’t want to be really thin now			0
i do n’t not eat , but i do exercise and i watch more what i eat and i try not to drink as much now [ she ’s had some famously drunken episodes in the past ] ; i never drink at home alone any more ’ it ’s a gruesome contradiction , talking about what will happen after her death , when we are meant to be discussing her new book , @entity206 , which is largely about her childhood and teenage years , before she found success as a conceptual , confrontational artist			0
it ’s a wonderful , evocative edit from a personal stash of 10,000 photos			0
can she see she was destined for great things in those early snapshots ? philanthropist : @entity2 will leave all her estate to a variety of charities ‘ i was brought up with a lot of love from my mum and dad			0
being wilful meant i had an idea of what was wrong and what was right for me			0
' i spent quite a lot of time alone as a child , too , so i think i was always introspective			0
and even when i was little , i liked creating things			0
i used to make doll ’s houses out of cardboard boxes			0
’ she must like looking at herself , i venture ; much of her art consists of her own body , photographed , drawn or painted			0
( she works in many different media : at the moment , watercolour			0
) not vain , exactly , but self - obsessed			0
did she realise she was , is , beautiful ? ‘ i never realised what i looked like and i wish i had ; i would have made much more of it			0
' i ’ve always had a thing about my body , always not felt good about it			0
the happiest i am is the thinnest i can be			0
i think the less of me there is the better i feel about it			0
' it ’s a thing you should n’t really say , but that ’s the truth , that made me feel good			0
i was super-fit as well , rode a bike everywhere , swam a kilometre every day … you ’re not going to be fat if you do that , and also i was never a big eater			0
’ and now ? ‘ not now			0
i would n’t want to be really thin now			0
i do n’t not eat , but i do exercise and i watch more what i eat and i try not to drink as much now [ she ’s had some famously drunken episodes in the past ] ; i never drink at home alone any more			0
