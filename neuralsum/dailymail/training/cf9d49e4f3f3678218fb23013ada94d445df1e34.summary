she said : ‘ it was a bit of a shock really			0
although deep down i think i ’ve always known that me or my sister @entity28 would have twins			1
' they did the scan and i could see on the screen they were looking at the one baby and i saw something else which in the corner and i thought well there ’s nothing else that could be round like that apart from another head			0
' and i thought no , do n’t be silly and then she moved it over and she went “ and there ’s twin two ”			2
' the girls – who are featured in @entity60 ’s @entity59 tonight – were born five weeks premature and spent the first few weeks of life in a special care baby unit			1
they are now seven months old			0
family album : the babies ' great - grandmother @entity64 , pictured , also had a twin sister history : the babies ' grandfather @entity31 ( left ) and his twin @entity33 being held by their mother @entity69 , also a twin newborns : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity6 were born to their mother @entity73 prematurely the pattern for twins in the family began with @entity6 and @entity7 ’s great - grandmother , @entity64 , who had a twin named @entity79			1

@entity73 , a school kitchen manager from @entity82 , is anticipating that her girls will develop the same close bond she shares with her identical sister			1
however , she and her husband @entity86 are adamant she wo n’t dress them in identical clothes			0
she said : ‘ my @entity89 always used to put me and my sister in the same thing and we hated it			2
we hated being the same because we were separate people			0
’ at times she has seen spooky visions of her twin which turned out to be true , she said			2
' one time @entity28 had already gone to school and i was off sick and i woke up and said to mum “ i want to wear my leg warmers ” and she said “ you ’re not going anywhere , what do you want to wear your leg warmers for ? ” ' , she said			2
twice the effort : mrs @entity7 said she always knew she or her sister would end up having twins screen stars : @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 , from @entity82 , will feature tonight on @entity60 's @entity59 the school kitchen manager hopes her girls will develop the same bond she shares with her sister ( right ) ' and i said “ because @entity28 ’s got hers on , i want to wear mine ”			1

’ on other occasions mrs @entity7 knew when her sister hurt herself – once picturing the smiley face plaster the school nurse had just put on @entity28 ’s knee			1
and she said she often knows when her sister is about to phone			0
in the @entity122 there is a 112 - to - one chance of a pregnancy resulting in non-identical twins			2
@entity127 health journal , @entity128 , estimate the odds of four generations of twins in one family are one in four billion			0
however , yesterday @entity133 of the @entity134 said it was difficult to estimate how common fourth generation twins are as it depends on whether they are identical or non-identical , and a database tracking this information is not known about			0
she said : ‘ it is terribly complicated			0
the rate of identical twinning is fairly constant , for any woman anywhere there is about a three to five per thousand risk			0
' but with non-identicals there is a rare gene carried by females			0
so if a woman carrying the gene has twins , her daughter has a four times greater chance of having twins herself			0
