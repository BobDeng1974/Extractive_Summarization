with or without @entity1 , one question is being asked ahead of the weekend ’s standout clash : can @entity4 ’s defence handle @entity6 ’s attack ? the theory is @entity4 ’s inexperienced rearguard will find it difficult to shackle the league leaders ’ vibrant forwards			1
no @entity1 for @entity6 ? no problem			1
not when @entity13 can unleash , among others , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
yet here ’s another way of looking at things : do @entity4 ’s forwards have enough to menace @entity6 ’s back four ? the manner in which @entity25 ’s team have defended so far may be a cause for concern but is what is happening at the other end of the pitch a potentially bigger worry ? @entity4 's @entity32 trains during friday 's session alongside @entity34 and @entity35 @entity6 's @entity1 celebrates scoring their second goal against @entity37 at @entity38 on october 4 tackling the title favourites is @entity41 ’s biggest test since he became manager and all over the pitch there will be key battles , not least whether his attackers can come up with the wit and skill to outfox @entity49 and @entity50 , the best central defensive pairing in the @entity52			1
if you were naming a dream team , many of you — for good reason — would have your three forwards as @entity34 , @entity32 and @entity35			1
they have been magnificent players , their quality undisputed around the world			0
those three should guarantee bundles of goals			0
but here ’s the thing			0
@entity64 recently turned 31 , @entity34 was 29 on friday — the same age @entity35 will be when he celebrates his next birthday			0
the concern for clubs when strikers get into that age range is whether they will maintain their standards and consistency , never mind get better			0
improvement is not something @entity41 has to worry about with his defence			2
@entity76 is 19 , @entity77 only 22 ; @entity78 is a 24 - year - old who has played in a @entity80 final , while @entity81 is 20			2
@entity4 may need another centre back but that quartet ’s best years are ahead of them			1
can you say the same about the strikers ? let ’s start with @entity64 , the man whose goals were the catalyst for @entity4 ’s last title in 2013			1
when i have watched him over the last 12 - 18 months , he has looked a different player to the one who spearheaded sir @entity94 ’s attack when he arrived from @entity37			2
if you were going to back a coach to get @entity64 thriving , you would pick @entity41 , his compatriot , but he has looked off the pace			2
you could argue he is feeling the effects of the @entity80 but even in @entity98 he did n’t look right			0
is he just out of form or has he reached that stage when the dip starts ? last season he had to contend with the old criticisms that he was injury - prone and we did n’t see evidence of the great partnership with @entity34 that we all expected			1
an interesting statistic is the fact they have only created a total of eight goals for each other since they became a pair in 2012			0
do n’t get me wrong , he has been a brilliant striker			2
but now he is 31 , you have to wonder whether we have seen his best			0
that is a question i also asked about @entity34 earlier in the season			2
in terms of the number of games he has played in his career , he is the equivalent of a 32 - year - old			0
as for @entity35 , the issue with him is intriguing			0
he was the best out - and - out striker in the world not so long ago and we have seen flashes of quality since he arrived at @entity132 , but he is coming to the most demanding league in the world on the back of a cruciate - ligament injury			1
that does n’t necessarily mean there is a problem			0
@entity140 arrived in @entity141 on the back of a similar injury and became one of the best strikers the @entity52 has seen			1
he had time on his side to recover , though , as he was 23 when suffering it			2
@entity4 have agreed a £ 43.5million fee with @entity149 to make @entity35 ’s loan move permanent and the option is there to send him back if things do n’t work out			1
if they do , though , it is still a huge outlay on a player for whom they could never recoup that amount			0
@entity35 ( centre ) and @entity34 ( right ) put @entity162 's defence under pressure during the 4 - 0 win last month @entity4 manager @entity25 looks on as his team prepare for sunday 's match against @entity6 @entity4 duo @entity81 ( left ) and @entity76 look focused as they take part in @entity41 's training session there will come a point in the next couple of years when @entity4 have to replace @entity64 , @entity34 and @entity35 but , to do that , they are going to have to spend in excess of £ 80m to bring in two strikers			1
it makes you wonder , then , why @entity41 was so quick to off - load @entity177 to @entity37			0
@entity41 was brutal when saying the @entity179 striker was ‘ below @entity4 ’s standards ’ , but does n’t the manager have a reputation for improving young players ? @entity177 might not have the pedigree of the others but he has got pace and youth — qualities @entity4 could do with — and his total of six goals for @entity37 already is as many as @entity35 ( one ) , @entity64 ( two ) and @entity34 ( three ) have scored between them so far			1
like @entity4 ’s defenders , @entity177 ’s best years are in front of him and that decision to sell him may one day be a cause for regret			2
if the present is about how @entity41 organises his defence , the future is going to be about how he replaces his attack			0
it wo n’t come cheap			0
@entity140 ( left ) and sir @entity94 pose for the cameras after the @entity202 signed in 2001 @entity37 striker @entity177 ( right ) is challenged by @entity204 's @entity203 on wednesday @entity64 ( left ) , @entity34 ( second left ) and @entity35 look dejected as @entity4 lose 5 - 3 to @entity205 @entity207 's crime was being naive in shirt - swap row another week passes and again @entity209 is in the news , this time for his decision to swap shirts with @entity213			1
the incident has been blown out of proportion			2
had @entity209 actively looked to take @entity213 ’s shirt , my blood would have been boiling			1
the reason there has been such anger is that a player swapping shirts at half - time suggests their mind is not on the job			1
but look at the clips again			0
@entity209 has his head bowed and @entity213 asks for his shirt , not vice-versa			1
it makes the situation completely different			0
this was n’t like @entity37 ’s @entity234 getting @entity32 ’s jersey or the incident with @entity237 , another @entity239 player , and @entity240			2
@entity239 striker @entity209 ( second left ) is approached by @entity213 ( second right ) as he leaves the pitch @entity209 and @entity213 swap shirts as they head towards the tunnel at half - time of the @entity246 clash @entity213 puts his arm round @entity209 's shoulder before the @entity239 striker is replaced on wednesday @entity209 was not souvenir - hunting and you can see from his reaction that he has little interest in taking @entity213 ’s shirt			1
on this occasion , he genuinely looked to be minding his own business and had not walked off the pitch pestering @entity213			2
all he has been guilty of on this occasion is naivety			0
if he had walked another three or four steps down the tunnel , we would never have known			0
if he had thought properly , he could have done what @entity263 did with @entity265 and taken @entity213 ’s shirt after the game			1
looking at the bigger picture , though , his form and body language have been as underwhelming as it was when he played for @entity270			0
so why did @entity239 buy him ? i am not alone in thinking he will not be at @entity272 next season and that raises another question : how do they sell him ? @entity209 ( second left ) has his eye on the ball during @entity239 's training session at @entity280 on thursday @entity209 ( right ) is put under pressure by team - mate @entity282 as @entity239 prepare for the weekend this week i 'm looking forward to ... ... @entity285 's @entity284 debut			1
it is great to see my old team - mate back in action and @entity289 , @entity284 ’s coach , has stated that @entity285 will feature at some point in el clasico			1
this is the biggest game in football , contested by the two most glamorous clubs on the globe and has always featured the best players in the world			0
i ’ve been to a couple of games and the atmosphere is extraordinary			0
@entity285 certainly deserves his place on this stage			2
i ca n’t help but wonder , though , where he is going to fit into @entity284 ’s team			1
@entity289 has been coy , not giving any clue about whether @entity285 will start at the @entity306 this evening , but he has no need to rush him into the action			1
@entity285 looks in good spirits as he chats with @entity310 ( centre ) and @entity312 ( right ) on friday @entity285 ( front ) is watched by @entity284 coach @entity289 ( right ) during training ahead of @entity314 @entity284 are top of the table and @entity312 and @entity316 are both in top form , so it is not as if they are crying out for a massive lift			1
neither of those players are going to make way for him , so the most obvious place for him is the one @entity325 occupies			0
the problem with that , however , is the fact it is on the right			0
i said when @entity285 left @entity239 that i could not see him playing in the role he did at @entity272 and i stand by that			1
it will be fascinating to see how he makes the adjustment			0
like @entity336 's facebook page			0
@entity285 ( second left ) , @entity337 ( left ) , @entity316 ( second right ) and @entity312 train on friday			2

@entity4 host @entity6 in the @entity52 on sunday
it is *uncertain* whether @entity1 will start for @entity13 's side
do @entity4 's forwards have enough to menace @entity6 's defence ?
@entity209 's half - time shirt swap has been blown out of proportion
@entity213 asked for the @entity239 striker 's shirt , not vice-versa
@entity284 take on @entity353 in @entity314 at the @entity306 on *saturday*
it will be great to see old team - mate @entity285 back in action
