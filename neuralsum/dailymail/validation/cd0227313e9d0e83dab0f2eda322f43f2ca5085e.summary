the saying ' @entity1 was n't built in a day ' could n't be more apt for super slimmer @entity2 who has recently lost ten stone			1
it has taken one year , and lots of hard work , but the mother - of - five has transformed her body after running 1,820 miles on a treadmill at home – the exact distance from @entity12 to the @entity14 capital			1
the 42 - year - old has also lost seven dress sizes in the process , taking her from a dangerous 21st and dress size 24 to a healthy and happy 11st and size 10			1

speaking at her home in @entity22 , @entity21 she says : ' i ca n't believe how far i 've come			1
' less than a year ago i could barely walk , now i 'm running marathons and am as fit as a fiddle			2
' what 's more , i 'm an active mum and can actually play with my kids and take them swimming without my huge tummy getting in the way			2
i 'm a new person			2
' in april 2010 , @entity2 , then 38 , was diagnosed with postnatal depression after giving birth to her youngest daughter , honey , now four			1
the mother - of - five rented a treadmill for £ 65 a month and turned her dining room into a home - gym she recalls : ' up until then i 'd been around 13st and a size 12 to 14			1
but following @entity46 's birth i fell into deep depression and struggled to get out of bed in the morning			2

' within the space of four years , @entity2 had ballooned from a size 12 to a 24 and was tipping the scales at 21 stone			1
she says : ' i was morbidly obese and was so ashamed of my wide girth i could n't face looking in the mirror or getting dressed in the mornings			2
@entity2 , pictured on her wedding day , says she was once ' an embarrassment to my kids , ' ' more importantly , it was preventing me from being a good mother			1
i was so overweight i could n't pick honey up or play with my kids because my gigantic tummy was in the way			0
' @entity2 explains that she was caught in a vicious circle : she felt guilty about her size which made her feel depressed and then turned to comfort food to make herself feel better			1

but during her rant she called me a ' fat cow '			0
' i went bright red and felt like i was going to burst into tears , it was horrible			0
' in that moment , @entity2 realised it was time to ditch the greasy snacks and calorific booze			1
too ashamed to be seen outside or exercise in a gym , she rented a £ 65 treadmill and turned her dining room into a home - gym			0
she says : ' it suited me perfectly because no one could watch me working out			0
' i downloaded a running training pack from online and started to do interval training			0
' walking for five minutes and then running for two			0

' on top of her new exercise regime , @entity2 totally changed her diet			1
she traded family - sized portions of spaghetti bolognese , cheese on toast , crisps and chocolate for fruit , yoghurt and low - calorie meals , and saw the weight start to drop off			2
on top of this , she stopped drinking white wine altogether , instead drinking water and fresh juice			0
she says : ' the exercise lifted my mood and i felt like a new person			0
