by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 07:51 est , 10 july 2012 the world 's smallest fly is a gruesome parasite that lives inside the heads of ants , growing in size until the victim is decapitated			1
the fly , found in @entity9 , is just 0.4mm long - the same size or smaller than a grain of salt			1
the adult flies lay eggs inside ants ' bodies , then the larvae grow to maturity inside their victims ' heads , until they finally fall off			1
small but deadly : the fly is a member of a family of parasitic insects that grow to maturity inside the heads of ants the discovery has shown that even the tiniest insects can be prey to parasites			2
the flies can decapitate victims with heads as small as 0.5mm			0
at just 0.40 millimeters in length , it is 15 times smaller than a house fly and five times smaller than a fruit fly			1
dr. @entity37 of the @entity38 of @entity39 , these flies can probably decapitate some of the smallest ants in the world , ones with heads as small as 0.5 millimeters			0
' it had always been assumed that smaller species of ants would be free from attack because it would be physically impossible for flies that are 1 - 3 millimeters in length to develop in their relatively tiny heads , ' he said			0
' however , here we show that even the smallest host ants in a host - parasitoid system can not escape			0
' at just 0.40 millimeters in length , it is 15 times smaller than a house fly ( pictured ) and five times smaller than a fruit fly the tiny fly , @entity59 , is also the first of its genus to be discovered in @entity62 , and it belongs to a fly family ( @entity64 ) that is known for " decapitating " ants			1
some species in the @entity64 fly family lay eggs in the bodies of ants , and the resulting larvae feed in the ants ' heads , eventually causing decapitation			2
in fact , some of these phorid flies are being used to try to control fire ants in the southern @entity79			0
although this has not yet been observed , it is highly likely because the fly 's only known relative , @entity84 , is known to parasitize ants in @entity86 .			0

fly is 15 times smaller than a house fly and five times smaller than fruit fly
larvae live inside ants ' heads until decapitation
gruesome parasite found in @entity9 is smaller than grain of salt
