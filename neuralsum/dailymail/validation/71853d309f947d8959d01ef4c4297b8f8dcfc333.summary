she had climbed the @entity1 , canoed down one of @entity4 's longest rivers and danced for more than a decade			0
and all this time , @entity5 had no idea she had a lethal , undiagnosed heart condition that could have killed her at any time			1
the self - confessed fitness fanatic was born with a heart defect that kills 90 per cent of babies before their first birthday if left undetected			1
the 25 - year - old , from @entity14 , had no idea she had the deadly disease - which is usually diagnosed at birth - until her heart suddenly stopped beating			1
ticking timebomb : self - confessed fitness fanatic @entity5 had no idea she had a lethal , undiagnosed heart condition that could have killed her at any time ' when i collapsed , my mum thought i 'd tripped over , ' she said			1
' it was n't until she heard a deathly rattling sound coming from my chest that she called an ambulance			0
' she thought i was dead because my skin had turned a deathly black colour as i lay lifeless on the floor			0
' ms @entity5 was rushed to hospital and put into a medically induced coma			1
and remarkably , after surgery to rewire her heart , she has made a full recovery			1
ms @entity5 was diagnosed with @entity36 ( @entity37 )			1
this is a rare heart condition where the main ventricle of the heart , which supplies oxygen to the body , is wired incorrectly			1
usually , the condition is diagnosed at birth , but there is 90 per cent chance a patient will die from heart failure by the age of one if undetected			1
ms @entity5 said : ' at first , doctors believed my heart stopped as a result of @entity54 not alcapa - it 's very rare for someone to survive past infancy with it			1
' ' doctors were amazed that i 'd lived with this condition for so long and never had any problems before			2
' indeed , she had always prided herself on being fit and healthy			0
' doctors asked if i 'd struggled walking up hills , but i 've walked the @entity1 - i 'm really fit and active , ' she said			0
' i 'd danced for 10 years , canoed one of the longest rivers in @entity4 and never had any symptoms , so it was a shock to everyone			0
' ' even was taken aback because doctors told me i should have been so unwell , it was really scary			0
danger : the self - confessed fitness fanatic was born with a heart defect that kills 90 per cent of babies before their first birthday if left undetected ' it 's terrifying as i now know i could have died at any moment			1
' months after her collapse , ms @entity5 underwent corective open heart surgery			1
she then had a year of rehabilitation to get her heart used to even the most gentle exercise			2
she said : ' after doctors fixed my heart i was really poorly , i did n't realise how much the surgery would affect me			1
' i could n't walk four steps without sweating buckets like i normally do during strenuous exercise			0
' i had to learn to build up my energy and became physically fit again			0
' every hour i 'd have to walk one length of my parents ' hallway to try and build my strength up			0
' it hurt to sit down on sofas and i 'd struggle to lift myself up because i did n't have enough energy to push myself up			0
' mentally it was pretty draining as well - at first i was scared to leave the house in case my heart stopped again			2
the 25 - year - old said : ' when i collapsed , my mum thought i 'd tripped over			2
it was n't until she heard a deathly rattling sound coming from my chest that she called an ambulance ' ' it took me a year to battle through everything but i 've came out the other end independent and stronger again			0
' she now goes to the gym every day and takes the stairs everywhere she can			0
and she says she 's glad she was n't diagnosed any earlier			0
' in some ways i 'm glad i did n't know i had @entity37 because i know i would have been wrapped up in cotton wool			0
if i knew about my condition i had this i do n't think i would have gone off to climb mountains or go on adventure holidays			2
' it took me a year to battle through everything but i 've came out the other end independent and stronger again			0
' since recovering , ms @entity5 has returned to a normal life but was keen to raise awareness of @entity37 and other congenital heart problems			1
she has also bared her six - inch scar in a photography exhibition ' scarred for @entity129 ' exhibition to raise awareness for the face behind heart problems			2
unaware : doctors were amazed she had lived with this condition for so long and never had any problems before			2
' doctors asked if i 'd struggled walking up hills , but i 've walked the @entity1 - i 'm really fit and active , ' said ms @entity5 proud : after major surgery to re-wire her heart , ms @entity5 has been left with a six - inch			1
she has now bared this in the photography exhibition ' @entity142 ' to raise awareness her picture joined those of seven other people who had pacemakers fitted and underwent heart surgery , at the @entity149 , in @entity14			1
she said : ' before i would always hide my scar , it was n't very nice to look at and it 's taken me a while to reveal it			0
' i never wanted people to ask about my scar or to notice it so i 'd hide behind clothing that would cover me from my chest up to my neck			0
' since having my scar on show at the exhibition i feel like i can talk about it and i 'm no longer ashamed of my mark			0
' having survived everything i 've been through has made my love my scar			0
' one little boy at the exhibit pointed at the picture of my scar and said to his mum that it was like his , which really warmed my heart			2
' we really want to get people talking about heart conditions as we 've nothing to be afraid of			2
' having revealed my scar i now feel so much more confident and for the first time wore a lower cut top last week			2
' now i feel strong enough to show it , the mark is a reminder of everything i 've overcame			0
' @entity37 is a rare heart condition you can be born with			1
left undiagnosed , it kills in 90 % of cases june @entity187 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity189 , said : ' @entity37 is a rare heart condition that you can be born with			1
' blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the left side of the heart , depriving the heart of oxygen , which can cause damage to the heart muscle			1
' surgery is needed to correct the condition and nowadays people with @entity37 have a much better prognosis			1
' an ' @entity37 ( anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery ) is a problem that occurs when the baby 's heart is developing early in the pregnancy			1
the developing blood vessels in the heart do not connect correctly			2
in the normal heart , the left coronary artery starts in the aorta			1
the aorta is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen - rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body			2
in children with @entity37 , the left coronary artery starts at the pulmonary artery			0
the pulmonary artery is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen - poor blood from the heart to the lungs			0
when this defect occurs , blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the left side of the heart			1
therefore , the heart does not get enough oxygen			0
when the heart muscle is deprived of oxygen , the tissue begins to die			0
this condition leads to a heart attack in the baby			1
a condition known as ' coronary steal ' further damages the heart in babies with @entity37			1
the low blood pressure in the pulmonary artery causes blood from the abnormal left coronary artery to flow toward the pulmonary artery instead of toward the heart			1
this results in less blood and oxygen to the heart			0
this problem will also lead to a heart attack in a baby			0
coronary steal develops over time in babies with @entity37 if the condition is not treated early			2

@entity5 had no idea she had lethal , undiagnosed heart condition
born with a heart defect that kills 90 % of babies before 1 if left undetected
only realised something was wrong when she suddenly collapsed
tests revealed she had rare condition where heart was wired incorrectly
has now *undergone* corrective surgery and is on road to recovery
