each year the awards season becomes more like a @entity2 episode			2
metaphorically at least , the combatants poke each other in the eye , bash each other over the head with frying - pans or planks of wood , each tumbling over the other to look more vindictive , more pompous , more ludicrous , more stupid			2
it starts , where else , with all the venal , pointless bile on social media : ‘ my favourite is better than your favourite , ’ which resembles nothing more closely than the playground ‘ my dad could batter your dad ’			2
but year - on - year the participants and football powers - that - be are abandoning dignity quicker than an i ’m a celebrity contestant			0
@entity33 's @entity32 star @entity31 holds up the @entity34 after winning the award in 2013 last year , we had the risible , hopefully soon - to - be - deposed , @entity37 prancing about the stage at the @entity39 impersonating @entity31 as some sort of stentorian automaton who ‘ spends more expenses on his hair than “ the other one ’ ’ and lauding his personal ‘ preference ’ for @entity47 because ‘ he ’s a nice boy ’			1
it was all against the delightful background of @entity52 forgetting that they were running a @entity54 the following summer , easy mistake , and thus that there were @entity54 qualifying play - offs in november 2013			1
the polls closed before the infamous @entity60 v @entity31 play - off ‘ super-matches ’ which were bound to influence the voters ( @entity52 ’s international coaches , captains and a select band of journalists ) and so a vast amount of them just did n’t bother responding			1
@entity31 is many people 's favourite to win the award again this year after winning the @entity70 @entity52 ‘ re-opened ’ the polls , announced that those who ’d already marked their ‘ x ’ could n’t vote again ( to take account of @entity31 ’s fabulous performance in eliminating @entity79 in that play - off ) , then informed them that they actually could ... on it went			1
like a bad @entity82 episode			0
nobody in @entity84 seemed to realise that when you produce a real - life narrative which would put the script - writers of @entity89 to shame then something ’s gone wrong			0
@entity33 demanded an apology on behalf of @entity31 , got it , and @entity31 duly won			1
@entity92 , principal star of @entity94 ’s treble season , spiralled down into a reverse @entity97 acceptance at the 1985 @entity98 ( ‘ you like me ...			0
right now you really like me ! ’ )			0
@entity47 has won the @entity34 three times and also won the @entity102 trophy too those around him in @entity104 needed to mop up tears for weeks ( ‘ they hate me , they really hate me ! ’ ) and even now he ’s still harping on about it in interviews : ‘ i learned a lot during last year ’s @entity34 gala			1
as soon as i got there , i told my wife that i would lose , ’ he whined last week			0
‘ i saw how @entity37 was hugging @entity31 and how his entire family was there			1
it was clear that he had to win it			0
he would n’t have brought his entire family with him otherwise			0
‘ it will be the same this year			0
@entity122 or @entity123 should win it			1
you ca n’t disagree with this			0
@entity127 has won it all , he ’s a great guy and he is n’t arrogant			1
@entity123 has played an incredible season in the @entity130 and then a fantastic @entity54			0
@entity47 is unlikely to win the award after @entity132 failed to win any major trophies last season ‘ but i fear it will be about politics again			2
the @entity34 is no longer for the best player			1
@entity138 won it in 2006 because he won the @entity54 , that ’s all			2
’ now @entity92 is n’t known for his @entity141 capabilities			0
but , i ask you			0
@entity123 or @entity122 ‘ should get ’ the @entity34 this year for their fantastic @entity144 , but @entity138 was a blaggard and a con man of the first order when winning it ... for @entity54 2006			1
and if @entity37 was fawning all over @entity31 , then lingering embarrassment at his @entity39 stupidity might explain it			1
this weekend , it ’s all taken a new , nonsensical turn			0
asked , well after voting had closed , about the @entity34 , @entity158 chief @entity157 replied that , in a @entity54 year , one of the players who ’d lifted that trophy in the summer should automatically be @entity34 winner , too			1
@entity37 got in trouble last year after admitting he would prefer @entity47 to win the award as he was ' nice ' he repeated an opinion he ’d given four years earlier when @entity165 and @entity166 were both pipped by @entity47 because of his individual brilliance in a year when @entity168 became world champions			2
both @entity170 admitted that they were pleased @entity47 won			2
@entity157 put into words a sentiment that many ( particularly the voting journalists , i believe ) hold — but i ’d also ask how many of you really think that the @entity52 coaches and captains will now be remonstrating themselves and banging fists against their own head after the @entity180 spoke ? imagine it : ‘ @entity54 ! ? ! ? bloody hell , i never even thought of making that part of my consideration ! ! ! ’ or : ‘ dammit — @entity157 ’s come out for a @entity54 winner to lift the @entity34 , if i ’d only known how he ’d vote then i ’d obviously have trotted along behind him like an obedient little sheep			1
’ but , oh no. @entity33 exploded in an apoplectic vomit of nonsense — issuing a statement remonstrating with @entity157 for answering a question posed to him by a @entity170 news agency , declaring that anyone who opposes @entity31 for this award is an ideological criminal and questioning his impartiality despite the presence of @entity54 winning @entity198 in their own first @entity199 a number of @entity203 's @entity54 winners have been touted as possible winners of the award while all of this was happening , a much stranger fact emerged			1
the players world union @entity207 had n’t found a place for either @entity209 or @entity210 in their top 15 midfielders of 2014 despite the @entity214 pair ’s excellence in winning the @entity215 , @entity216 and coming within seconds of winning the @entity70			2
weird , i ’d suggest			0
but football democracy in action			0
@entity207 ’ s voting is not immune to errors or manipulation but the players had their voice and it did n’t shout : ‘ @entity214 ! ’ on sunday we ’ll know the final three for the @entity34			1
hopefully they are @entity31 , @entity122 and @entity47			1
i ’d expect the podium to reflect that order in january			0
but , if it does n’t , do n’t expect me to join the pitiful @entity2 pantomime .			0

final three for the @entity34 announced on sunday
@entity33 forward @entity31 won the award in 2013
@entity235 and @entity122 are among favourites for 2014 award
