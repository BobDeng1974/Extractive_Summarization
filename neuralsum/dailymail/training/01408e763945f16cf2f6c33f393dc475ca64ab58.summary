the @entity1 can not solve @entity3 's problems with military force , president @entity0 reiterated in a series of interviews taped on friday that aired across several networks on monday morning			1
only @entity3 can resolve the violent conflict tearing apart in their country , @entity0 said , and in order to do accomplish this , they must find a way to ignore their sectarian differences for the common good of their homeland			2
' if they ca n't , there 's not gon na be a military solution to this problem , @entity0 told @entity22 's @entity21			1
' there 's no amount of @entity1 fire power that 's gon na be able to hold the country together , and i 've made that clear to [ @entity3 prime minister @entity28 ] and all the other leadership inside of @entity3			1
' the @entity1 ca n't go in and occupy every country in the @entity31 facing turmoil , president @entity0 said in a series of interviews that aired on monday morning ¿ unless we are prepared to stay indefinitely in all these various countries , something that we can ¿ t afford , and it would involve over time accusations that we were occupying these countries , ¿ @entity0 told @entity42 co-host @entity43 , ¿ at some stage , they ¿ re gon na have to take responsibility for working together ' the @entity1 neither has the resources nor the responsibility to be the world police in the @entity31 , president @entity0 emphasized in the interviews			1
‘ unless we are prepared to stay indefinitely in all these various countries , something that we ca n’t afford , and it would involve over time accusations that we were occupying these countries , ’ @entity0 told @entity42 co-host @entity43 , ‘ at some stage , they ’re gon na have to take responsibility for working together			1
’ @entity1 's military can not run around the world playing ' whack - a - mole ' with extremist groups , the president has repeatedly said throughout the last several days			2
‘ keep in mind that our goal in @entity61 was to decapitate @entity62 , which had carried out 9/11			0
now @entity61 is a sovereign country that is gon na have to deal with its own security , ’ last month the president announced that he would significantly draw down troops in @entity61 by the end of the year			1
the president has made clear that he would not put boots back on the ground in @entity3			0
on thursday @entity0 announced that the @entity1 would deploy up to 300 military advisors to help train , advise and support the @entity3 army but made clear that the forces would not engage in combat with the @entity78 radicals violently attempting to conquer the country			1
@entity0 also dispatched secretary of state @entity80 to the region to meet with @entity3 prime minister @entity28 and other foreign leaders			1
the two met for roughly two hours this morning in @entity84 , and @entity80 said afterward the meeting was productive			0
according to the @entity88 , @entity3 officials familiar with the meeting said @entity28 again asked the @entity1 to launch air strikes against @entity90 , and , once again , he was rebuffed			2
@entity80 reportedly cited civilian casualties as an area of concern			0
president @entity0 has been credited with making similar remarks last week to members of @entity97 asking about air strikes			2
oceans apart : secretary of state @entity80 and @entity3 prime minister @entity28 met face to face in @entity84 on monday			1
the two government officials did n't appear to be on very friendly terms at a photo - op , but @entity80 said the 100 minute meeting went well @entity80 , center left , flew to @entity84 this morning to meet with @entity28 , right , and @entity3 's other leaders to personally urge the @entity107 - led government to give more power to political opponents before a @entity111 insurgency seizes more control across the country and sweeps away hopes for lasting peace the discussion between the two government officials was not expected to be friendly , given that @entity118 lawmakers have floated suggestions that the @entity3 premier should resign as a necessary first step toward quelling the vicious uprising			1
nor will it likely bring any immediate , tangible results , as @entity28 has shown no sign of leaving , and @entity3 officials have long listened to — but ultimately ignored — @entity1 advice to avoid appearing controlled by the decade - old specter of an @entity1 occupation in @entity84			2
still , having suffered together through more than eight years of war — which killed nearly 4,500 @entity1 troops and more than 100,000 @entity3 — the two wary allies are unwilling to turn away from the very real prospect of the @entity31 nation falling into a fresh bout of sectarian strife			0
' the support will be intense , sustained , and if @entity3 's leaders take the steps needed to bring the country together it will be effective , ' @entity80 said after the meeting			1
@entity80 also met with influential @entity107 cleric @entity143 , who heads a leading rival @entity107 political party ; parliament speaker @entity145 , one of @entity3 's highest - ranking @entity111 ; and foreign minister @entity147 , a kurd			2

islamic extremists have still been unable to get close to the country 's capitol city despite destroying neighboring towns even before @entity1 troops left @entity3 for good at the end of 2011 , a merciless @entity111 insurgency was pounding the country with car bombs , roadside explosions , suicide bombings and drive - by assassinations , mainly targeting the @entity107 government , its security forces and @entity107 pilgrims			1
since the start of this year , and peaking this month , @entity90 has overtaken several cities in @entity3 's west and north , and over the past weekend was controlling several main border crossings between @entity3 and @entity177			0
the three - year civil war in @entity177 — where @entity111 rebels are fighting to overthrow president @entity180 , whose @entity182 sect is an offshoot of @entity107 — emboldened @entity3 insurgents who regularly traverse the porous border to gain recruits , funding and weapons , and battlefield confidence			0
years of political instability in @entity84 fueled anger against the @entity107 - led government from @entity111 who felt powerless and saw their leaders targeted by @entity28 's security forces			0
a senior @entity197 official told the @entity88 the insurgents ' recent march on @entity84 has been slowed , although concerns remain that @entity90 will attack the golden - domed @entity107 shrine to the @entity202 in @entity203			0
that city , in @entity111 territory in north - central @entity3 , was the site of a 2006 bombing that triggered the worst of the war 's sectarian fighting			0
last week , senate majority leader @entity211 declared that @entity3 is currently in a civil war			0
@entity3 is the third stop on @entity80 's trip to the @entity31			0
the secretary of state , center , his staff and bodyguards are pictured here boarding a plane in @entity154 this morning @entity3 foreign minister @entity147 , second right , greets @entity80 , left , upon his arrival to @entity84 @entity80 's meeting in @entity84 today comes after an announcement by president @entity0 on thursday that the @entity1 would send up to 300 military advisers to @entity3 but no combat troops the official , who spoke to @entity88 before @entity80 's meeting , said the secretary of state would not ask @entity28 to resign , as some in the @entity1 and @entity111 @entity232 states in @entity31 have demanded , because ' it 's not up to us			1
' however , @entity80 was expected to urge @entity28 to quickly create a new government that is far more sensitive to @entity111 and @entity237 demands for jobs , power and a fair legal system			2
currently , @entity84 is operating under a lame - duck government , as a new parliament that was elected in april has not yet selected its cabinet ministers			0
it took more than nine months to seat a new government the last time @entity3 underwent the process , in 2010			0
this time around , the @entity197 official said , @entity28 and other @entity3 officials can not risk exacerbating the political instability , and further inflaming the insurgency , by stalling a new and more inclusive government			0
both president @entity0 and @entity3 's top @entity107 cleric , @entity252 , also have urged @entity28 to quickly form an inclusive government that promotes the interests of all of @entity3 's ethnic and religious groups			1
the @entity197 official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to be named in discussing the negotiations			0
he described @entity28 and other @entity3 officials as anxious about what , if any , additional help the @entity1 might provide to help curb @entity90 after @entity0 this week said he would send about 300 special forces troops to @entity84 to advise and train local security forces			1
@entity0 did not rule out the possibility of also launching airstrikes against the insurgents , but that is not expected anytime soon , if ever , and he has adamantly said he will not send combat forces back to @entity3			0
@entity80 greets @entity1 @entity270 as he arrives at the @entity271 in @entity84 a @entity274 / @entity273 poll released this morning found that @entity1 are divided about how they want the president to handle the situation			1
half of @entity1 believe that @entity1 does not have a responsibility to provide military assistance to the ailing country , while 42 percent said the @entity1 was obligated to intervene			2
likewise , 50 percent poll - takers said they believe the ongoing situation in @entity3 will not increase the threat of terrorism in the @entity1 , compared to the 44 percent who thought it would .			0

president @entity0 is standing firm in his *decision* not to deploy combat troops to @entity3
the country 's problems ca n't be solved by military might alone , he said , in interview that aired on @entity22 , @entity274 and @entity295 this morning
' there 's no amount of @entity1 fire power that 's gon na be able to hold the country together , ' @entity0 told @entity22
secretary of state @entity80 is in @entity3 meeting with government leaders , *including* prime minister @entity28 , delivering the @entity0 administration 's *message* in person that @entity3 must come together in order to save their country from despair
a new poll shows that more @entity1 than not believe the @entity1 is under no obligation to give @entity3 military assistance
