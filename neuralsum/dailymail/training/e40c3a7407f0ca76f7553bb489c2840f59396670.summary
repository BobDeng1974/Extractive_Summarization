by @entity1 reporter the @entity2 never conducted an investigation about a reported crash of several flying saucers in @entity6 detailed in a memo 63 years ago - which is now believed to have been an elaborate hoax			1
the memo from @entity10 , the special agent in charge of the @entity13 field office in 1950 , was released publicly via the @entity2 's website in april 2011			1
of all the agency 's documents that have been made public on its website , the so - called ' @entity15 ' is by far the most popular , with nearly a million views			1
popular : of all the agency 's documents that have been made public on its website , the so - called ' @entity15 ' is the most viewed , with nearly a million hits but as the @entity2 admits in a blog post appearing on its website , agents never took a second look into the bizarre report			1
in the memo , whose subject line is ' @entity29 ' , agent @entity10 says that an @entity31 investigator had stated that ' three so - called flying saucers had been recovered in @entity6			1
' the investigator gave the information to a special agent , he said			0
the @entity2 blurred out the names of both the agent and the investigator 's identity			2
agent @entity10 went on to write : ' they were described as being circular in shape with raised centers , approximately 50 feet in diameter			0
' each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall , ' he stated			0
the truth is out there : @entity49 became infamous after reports that a flying saucer had crashed in the desert near a military base there in 1947 the bodies were ' dressed in a metallic cloth of a very fine texture			2

above @entity72 honcho @entity71 told the network : ' the memo is based on a hoax that was carried out by a convicted con man named @entity77 , and it was debunked years ago			1
' it 's a pretty good and interesting hoax story , to be certain , but there is no value in it beyond that			0
' agent @entity10 said that the informant claimed the saucers had been found in @entity6 ' due to the fact that the government has a very high - powered radar set - up in that area and it is believed the radar interferes with the controlling mechanism of the saucers '			2
he then stated that the special agent did not attempt to investigate further			0
the @entity2 writes in its blog that director @entity94 authorized agents to verify the existence of flying saucers at the request of the @entity31			1
it adds : ' that practice ended in july 1950 , four months after the @entity65 memo , suggesting that our @entity101 did nâ€™t think enough of that flying saucer story to look into it			2
' the blog goes on : ' the @entity65 memo does not prove the existence of @entity106 ; it is simply a second - or third - hand claim that we never investigated			1
' agent @entity10 died in 1990			0
the town of @entity111 in @entity6 became infamous after reports that a flying saucer had crashed in the desert near a military base there on or around july 2 , 1947			1
