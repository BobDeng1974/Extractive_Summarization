@entity0 : researchers found having a dog made people feel less isolated they are known as man ’s best friend – but having a dog can help you socialise more with people too , says a study			1
researchers at the @entity11 found having a dog made people feel less isolated , while other pets including cats , lizards and hamsters , had no effect			1
professor @entity19 told the @entity21 ’s conference : ‘ we find that dogs are associated with less loneliness			2
‘ unfortunately for cat owners , cats , reptiles and rodents are n’t associated with a difference			2
’ he added : ‘ we did n’t determine what it was about a dog – but one of the things that dogs require that other pets do n’t is that you have to walk them			1
‘ when you take them out and walk them you get exercise and you meet your neighbours			0
i do n’t know about you , but i ’ve met neighbours over the years through my children and my pets			2
’ he added : ‘ i think my dog also likes me and that may be part of it			2
i think this getting out , walking , talking to people could be sufficient for a dog ’s health benefits relative to other pets			1
’ @entity56 , former veterinary director of @entity57 , said that when one dog stops to ‘ talk ’ to another dog , the owners stop to chat too			0
he added : ‘ if you are out with your dog , most people who are walking a dog will say “ hello ” at least , but other people without dogs just walk past			1
findings : researchers at the @entity11 ( pictured ) found having a dog made people feel less isolated , while other pets including cats , lizards and hamsters , had no effect ‘ in terms of reducing loneliness , dogs are more of a spur to people			1
you do n’t take your cat to a training class			0
‘ animals like rats are very intelligent and interact , but they do n’t induce interactions with others			0
’ mr @entity56 , who is also a former director of the @entity90 , also echoed the professor ’s comments about dogs being more loving than cats			0
he said : ‘ there is the old adage that you do n’t own your cat – it owns you			0
cats tend to interact when they want to , whereas dogs tend to interact when you want them to			0
’ ' we find that dogs are associated with less loneliness			0
unfortunately for cat owners , cats , reptiles and rodents are n’t associated with a difference ' professor @entity19 there are other health reasons why dogs are man ’s best friend			0
for instance , a review of research by the @entity115 suggested that pet owners have healthier hearts than other people – and dog owners particularly benefit			1
this may be because of the necessity to go for walks , whatever the weather			0
studies show that dog owners walk more than other people , making them more likely to meet government guidelines on physical activity			1
for instance , an @entity131 study found that dog owners walked for an average of five hours a week - compared with less than three hours for others .			1
