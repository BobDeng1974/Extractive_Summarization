many football managers nowadays pay more attention to statistics and sports science than ever before , but few will have ever gone this far			1
professor @entity6 has produced a mathematical formula to guarantee @entity9 success at this summer ’s @entity10 in @entity11 - and also on how to take the ‘ perfect penalty ’			1
the @entity14 physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - but he believes the heat , the altitude and the distance from home could all scupper @entity9 's chances			1
he said match officials from the northern hemisphere will be less sympathetic to the on - pitch dramatics of the country ’s mercurial striker @entity41 of @entity43			1
professor @entity6 , whose analysis was commissioned by bookmakers @entity46 , has also come up with ‘ a formula for the perfect penalty ’			1
he said : ‘ ever since the dawn of civilisation , people have not been content to see events as unconnected and inexplicable			2
they have craved an understanding of the underlying order in the world			2
’ the professor , whose book @entity59 was a best - seller , has appeared in shows such as @entity62 and @entity63 and even starred in an advert for the website @entity66			2
graphical : the effect of home and away kits on @entity9 performances in the @entity72 and @entity10 historical data : this graph shows how @entity9 have fared in matches against opponents from each continent line up : professor @entity6 said that @entity9 should play 4 - 3 - 3 rather than 4 - 4 - 2 , based on its success he said @entity9 's chances of success could be worked out by examining ‘ environmental , physiological , psychological , political and tactical variables ’			1
falling over : professor @entity6 took a swipe at ' ballerina ' @entity41 of @entity43 and @entity37 professor @entity6 added : ‘ statistically @entity9 's red kit is more successful and we should play 4 - 3 - 3 rather than 4 - 4 - 2			1
‘ psychologists in @entity88 found red makes teams feel more confident and can lead them to being perceived as more aggressive and dominant			2
‘ likewise , 4 - 3 - 3 is more positive so the team benefits for similar psychological reasons			2
‘ the data shows we also need to hope for a @entity35 referee			1
@entity35 referees are more sympathetic to the @entity9 game and less sympathetic to ballerinas like @entity41			1
‘ like all animals , the @entity9 team are creatures of habit			1
being closer to home reduces the negative impact of cultural differences and jetlag			1
we do better in temperate climates , at low altitudes with kick - off as close to the normal three o'clock as possible			2
‘ the impact of environmental factors alone is quite staggering			2
a 5c rise in temperature reduces our chances of winning by 59 per cent			1
‘ we are twice as likely to win when playing below 500 metres ( 1,600ft ) above sea level			1
and our chances of winning improve by a third when kicking off at three o'clock local time			1
’ professor @entity6 also outlined his formula for taking penalties			2
he said the key to success was a run - up of more than three steps and giving the ball ‘ some welly ’ , but ‘ velocity is nothing without placement ’			2
looking back : the physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - when @entity130 lifted the trophy for @entity9 three @entity132 : @entity9 's @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 celebrate victory after a @entity10 2014 qualifying match against @entity141 at @entity142 last october ' this will remain one of science 's great mysteries ' : professor @entity6 said there is no evidence that it 's advantageous to be left or right - footed but bald players and fair - haired players are more likely to score goalkeeper mobility : players should place the ball in the top left or right hand corner when taking a penalty he said : ‘ if only i had whispered this in @entity159 's ear before he sent the ball into orbit in 1990			1
use the side foot rather than laces and you are 10 per cent more likely to score			2
' a 5c rise in temperature reduces our chances of winning by 59 per cent			1
we are twice as likely to win when playing below 500 metres above sea level ' professor @entity6 ‘ the statistics confirm the obvious			1
place the ball in the top left or right hand corner for the best chance of success - 84 per cent of penalties in those areas score			0
‘ the ability of strikers to place the ball results in them being more likely to score than midfielders and defenders			0
‘ there is no evidence that it 's advantageous to be left or right - footed but bald players and fair - haired players are more likely to score			0
the reason for this is unclear			0
this will remain one of science 's great mysteries			0
’ @entity46 , spokesman for @entity46 , said : ‘ the modern game is so full of statistical analysis that for us it was a no brainer to call on professor @entity6 to give @entity9 some help			1
’ famous : @entity200 correctly predicted the outcome of eight matches at the @entity203 , including @entity88 's thrashing of @entity9 and @entity206 's victory over the @entity207 in the final			1
he died later that year four years ago at the @entity203 in @entity209 , @entity200 gained legendary status after correctly predicting the results of various games			0
' @entity214 players and fair - haired players are more likely to score			0
the reason for this is unclear			0
this will remain one of science 's great mysteries ' professor @entity6 on penalties the tentacled creature correctly predicted the outcome of eight matches at the @entity203 , including @entity88 's thrashing of @entity9 and @entity206 's victory over the @entity207 in the final			1
he cost bookmakers thousands after floating languidly towards boxes of mussels draped in the colours of competing teams in the tournament			0
he died in his sleep in october that year , but his former carers at the @entity234 in @entity235 , @entity88 , decided he should be given a shrine to mark his seemingly expert predictions			0
formula for success : professor @entity6 and @entity46 , spokesman for @entity46 professor @entity6 , 72 , has lived with debilitating motor neurone disease since the age of 22 but despite this cruel struggle he still became the world 's most renowned astrophysicist			0
he is a sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - which has robbed him of almost all physical movement he is an exceptional case , having survived for more than 40 years , despite doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed			0
in his incredible life his countless scientific papers , best - selling books and numerous awards have earned him comparisons with @entity258 and sir @entity259			0
but he is as much a celebrity as he is a scientist , appearing on tv cartoon @entity62 , starring in @entity261 and providing narration for a @entity264 commercial that was later sampled on a @entity266 album			0
in the 1970s , already confined to a wheelchair , he produced a stream of first class research , including probably his most important contribution to cosmology			0
this was the discovery of @entity6 radiation , which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing			0
by applying quantum mechanics to black holes , he had taken the first steps to combining quantum theory and general relativity			0
one describes the universe at the sub-atomic level , and the other at very large scales			1
bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals of modern physics			0
in the 1980s , professor @entity6 and professor @entity292 , from the @entity293 at @entity294 , proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time			0
the concept was described in @entity59 , which sold 25million copies worldwide			0
in recent years , professor @entity6 has examined the relationship between science and religion , writing a 2010 book , grand design , which argues that evoking @entity307 is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe			0
he met the @entity310 at a scientific event hosted by the @entity312 in 2008 .			0

chances could be scuppered by heat , altitude and distance from home
but @entity9 would be helped if referee for @entity37 match is @entity35
the physicist says @entity325 temperature rise reduces winning chances by 59 *%*
@entity9 twice as likely to win when playing below 1,600ft above sea level
