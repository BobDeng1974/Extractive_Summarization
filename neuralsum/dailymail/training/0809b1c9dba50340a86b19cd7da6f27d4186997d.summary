by @entity0 gardener ’s growing interest in exotic and foreign plants is helping to save the threatened bumblebee , ecologists say			2
growing a variety of plants creates a diverse ecosystem in a garden , which scientists say provides bees and other pollinating insects with a range of food sources			2
a new study suggests that the most common species of @entity18 bumblebees are not fussy about a plant ’s origin when searching for nectar and pollen			1
a survey has found that @entity18 bumblebees have no preference on the type of flower they are extracting pollen from , making display gardens with oriental and exotic flowers a lifesaver for the species academics conducted a three - month survey in the gardens of a residential street in @entity37			1
they found that of the six garden plants most commonly visited by bumblebees , only one - the @entity38 - was a @entity18 native			1
common foreign plants favoured by the bees included trailing bellflower , which originates in the mountains of the @entity48 , @entity49 , a hybrid bush bred from plants from @entity52 and @entity53 , @entity55 shrubs from @entity56 , and lilac from @entity58			0
the team , from @entity60 , found that bees simply visited plants in proportion to flower availability			0
while study showed that most bees are not fussy about the origin of their nectar , some species have a preference for @entity18 plants , such as the long - tongued garden bumblebee , which chooses @entity18 and @entity75 plants for 78 per cent of its flower visits ecologist dr @entity78 , lead author of the study published in the journal @entity81 , said this encouraged gardeners to cast their net wide when choosing what to cultivate			1
‘ urban gardens are increasingly recognised for their potential to maintain or even enhance biodiversity , ’ he said			0
‘ in particular , the presence of large densities and varieties of flowering plants supports a number of pollinating insects whose range and abundance has declined as a consequence of agricultural intensification and habitat loss			0
‘ by growing a variety of plants from around the world , gardeners ensure that a range of food sources is available for many different pollinators			0
‘ but until now we have had very little idea about how the origins of garden plants actually affect their use by our native pollinators			0
’ the study showed that while most bees are not fussy about the origin of their nectar , some species have a preference for @entity18 plants			1
the long - tongued garden bumblebee , for example , chose @entity18 and @entity75 plants for 78 per cent of its flower visits , a preference developed over thousands of years			1
dr @entity78 said that as a general rule bees would go wherever there are flowers available			0
but if native plants such as the foxglove disappeared completely , some species would be at risk			2
he said : ‘ in addition to growing truly native plants like foxgloves , where possible , gardeners can help native pollinators by setting aside a small area to allow native brambles , vetches , dead nettles , and clovers to grow			0
‘ but as long as some native species are available in nearby allotments , parks , or other green spaces , a combination of commonly - grown garden plants from all around the globe will help support our urban bumblebees for future generations			1

most @entity18 bees are not fussy about the plant when they *collect* pollen
three month survey shows that only one plant in six was a @entity18 native
some species of bees , such as the long tongued bee , prefer @entity18 plants
exotic plants have given endangered bees a much *needed* boost
