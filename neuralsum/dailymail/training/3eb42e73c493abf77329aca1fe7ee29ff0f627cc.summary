by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 23 march 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 23 march 2013 an @entity2 chief responsible for planning top - secret operations in the @entity4 was under armed protection last night after a life - threatening security blunder led to his identity being exposed on the internet			1
the commander met high - ranking officers from a @entity4 country earlier this month to discuss joint operations between @entity14 @entity13 and local troops			1
during the get - together a photograph was taken of the officers in their desert uniforms			1
this image and a report of the event should have been vetted by @entity14 officials before being released to the media in the host country			2
astonishingly , the leaking of the officer ’s name and his role were discovered not by the @entity29 or the @entity30 but by this newspaper			1
an @entity2 chief responsible for planning top secret operations had his cover blown when this photograph for revealed due to his status , the man is considered a prime target for @entity40 terrorist groups			1
the mail on sunday ’s intervention triggered a tightening of his personal security arrangements			0
the @entity29 also thanked this newspaper for bringing the matter to its attention and a spokesman insisted that efforts were being made to remove the material from websites			0
however , last night the image and the report of the @entity2 officer ’s engagement with military officials remained online , raising the possibility that he may have to be flown back to @entity14 for his own safety			1
a blame - game also started , with @entity30 sources denying responsibility for the leak , even though the event was staged at a @entity14 embassy			2
a source suggested that regardless of the venue , it was up to the @entity29 and not the @entity30 to put the necessary security measures in place to protect personnel			0
colonel @entity71 underlined the need to be careful with the internet military experts suggested the leak could compromise @entity14 intelligence - gathering in the @entity4 , in particular with regard to @entity78 , because foreign security agencies will glean vital information from reading the report			2
for security reasons @entity82 is not naming the country where the meeting took place			1
colonel @entity71 , a former member of @entity87 , the government ’s emergency response committee , said : ‘ this incident underlines the need to be more careful because , with the internet , once it ’s there , it is there , and it is very hard to do anything about it			0
‘ undoubtedly , anyone who is interested will have noted the report and will continue to do so			0
‘ i am concerned for the officer ’s personal security , and i trust that the @entity29 will be taking steps to ensure that this does not happen again			2
there is always great sensitivity surrounding the presence of @entity105 anywhere in the world , and for this reason a lot of effort is made to try to conceal their identities			0
’ as the @entity14 campaign in @entity114 draws to a close , the @entity2 is seeking to embed soldiers into the armies of @entity4 states in order to provide tactical training and gather vital information			1
a regimental source said : ‘ the focus is on small teams of troops spending weeks and months with local forces , developing their skills and , while they ’re there , getting to know the ground and seeing what the @entity78 are up to			0
‘ but these are supposed to be covert missions , not public relations exercises for local top brass			0
‘ if they ’re too busy pushing photographs and reports of what we ’re doing to the state media organisations , without thinking what the potential fall - out could be for the @entity2 personnel working with them , then lives are going to be put at risk			1
’ @entity4 states such as @entity143 and @entity144 have recently accused @entity78 of aiding uprisings in their countries			0
the invitations from states in the region to the @entity2 and @entity14 intelligence to offer training and advice is intended to thwart these attempts			1
an @entity29 spokesman said : ‘ we have a long - standing policy of not commenting on the work of our @entity13			2
’ a @entity30 spokesman also declined to comment on the matter .			0
