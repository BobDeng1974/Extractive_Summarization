the internet is littered with funny , cute and slightly absurd pictures of cats			0
and if you have uploaded an image of your feline on social media , there is a possibility this cat stalking map will be able to find it			1
not only that , but it will be able to pinpoint exactly where you uploaded it , locating your home address , anywhere in the world			2
zoom in on this map to find a cat in your area the project was started by data analyst and artist @entity22 from @entity23 who wanted to highlight the risks of putting location data on the photos people take			1
location data is often added to images via the camera itself or an accompanying app , providing details on the latitude and longitude of where the photo was taken			1
dubbed the ‘ i know where your cat lives ’ project , the cat map was built with the help of a supercomputer at @entity44			1
the computer geo - tagged and uploaded a sample of one million photos of cats taken on social media and then plotted them in a zoomable @entity51			1

this image shows data from the south east of @entity77 geotagging happens when geographical information is added to various media in the form of metadata			2
the data is often made up of coordinates like latitude and longitude , and may also include bearing , altitude , distance and place names			0
it is most commonly used for photographs and can help people get a lot of specific information about where the picture was taken or the exact location of a friend who logged on to a service			2
there are a number of privacy issues around geotagging - particularly when third party apps automatically make use of it without notifying the user			0
currently , there are 15 million images tagged with the word ' cat ' on public image hosting sites , and daily thousands more are uploaded from unlimited positions on the globe			2
professor @entity22 used photos that were tagged ' cat ' from @entity117 , @entity118 , and several other image hosting sites , then he scrubbed the metadata from it			1
this means that the results you see on the map are anonymous , and there is no way of identifying the original account it came from			0
‘ with an estimated 7.8 metres accuracy , if you took a photo of your cat in your home you might find it near that location on the map , ’ professor @entity22 said			1
the map can zoom into a specific location , providing generalised data as to how many cats are in that area			2
zooming in further allows the viewer to see what cats lurk in that area , down to street level			0
meanwhile , a ‘ random cat ’ button , allows the user to look at images of individual cats throughout the world			2
he added that if anyone sees a picture of themselves that they do n’t want up there , he will immediately take it down			0

the map can zoom into a specific location , providing generalised data as to how many cats are in that area but , he adds , so far the reaction has been the opposite			2
‘ the default seems to be there 's less privacy , this kind of commercial culture that makes everything on the internet open , ’ professor @entity22 told @entity184 at @entity185			1
‘ i think it 's logical to do something like this			0
@entity193 is an ongoing , changing thing , and i hope this becomes part of the conversation			0
’ professor @entity22 came up with the idea when he was using @entity118 to photograph his three - year - old			1
one day he realised that the app had been recording the exact coordinates of his home for the world to see			0
the professor has now created a @entity206 to raise funds for hosting the site			0
he explains the project ‘ explores two uses of the @entity210 : the sociable and humorous appreciation of domesticated felines , and the status quo of personal data usage by start - ups and international megacorps who are riding the wave of decreased privacy for all			0
‘ this website does n't visualise all of the cats on the net , only the ones that allow you to track where their owners have been			0
