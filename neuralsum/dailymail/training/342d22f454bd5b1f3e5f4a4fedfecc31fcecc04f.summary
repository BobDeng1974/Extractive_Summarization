by @entity1 reporter published : 12:42 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 17:14 est , 20 june 2013 researchers claim that a brutal slave - trader who brought captive slaves from @entity5 to @entity6 is the same man whose descendants produced two @entity9 presidents			1
@entity10 and his father , @entity11			2
historians already knew that the @entity11 family was directly connected to @entity14 , yet they were unable to figure out which was the ancestor of the @entity11 's			1
records show there was a @entity14 who was a merchant from @entity19 who was in @entity21 in 1758			0
looking back : researchers claim that a notoriously vicious slave - trader who brought captive slaves from @entity5 to @entity6 is the same man whose descendants produced two @entity9 presidents history of slavery : you have to go back six generations to find the ancestor that is directly linked to the present day @entity11 and @entity10 keeping it in the family : over the course of 200 years it is clear to see how the former presidents are related to their slavemaster ancestor archives also show @entity14 was a slave merchant and captain who bought and sold @entity5 slaves in the late 1700s			1
however , it was only recently that a retired genealogist and a historian in @entity45 finally figured out the two @entity46 are actually the same person			0
two men helped to clear up the murky past of the @entity11 's			1
@entity50 , a retired newspaper editor and genealogist in @entity52 has previously documented other @entity11 ancestors as slave owners in the @entity9 and @entity55 , an @entity9 historian who has spent much of his adult life in @entity45 , the former @entity57 colony on the @entity5 coast			1
missing link : the ancestral link between the @entity11 family and the slave trade is confirmed history : although @entity21 outlawed slavery in 1833 and it was abolished in the @entity9 after the defeat of the @entity68 in the @entity69 in 1865 , the transatlantic trade in african slaves continued supporter of @entity5 : on his 2003 visit to @entity72 , a former slave fort off the coast of the @entity74 , @entity10 denounced the slave trade as one of ' the greatest crimes of history			1
' analysis of old records and signatures now provides confirmation			0
@entity14 married in 1785 at @entity83 , which along with @entity84 and @entity85 was one of the three @entity57 cities highly involved in the @entity89 slave trade			1
he later emigrated to the @entity9			0
scans of the two @entity92 ' signatures were sent experts at @entity94 and at @entity95 in @entity84 without any information on their significance			0
both experts confirmed that the signatures were written by the same person			0
@entity14 married @entity101 had three children , @entity103 , @entity14 , and @entity11 , born between 1785 and 1797			2
@entity14 's third son was named @entity11 , and his grandson who born in 1875 , was the first @entity106 and it is his descendants that lead to the presidency			2
@entity11 's daughter , @entity111 , married @entity112 , and their son and grandson became the presidents 41 and 43 of the @entity9			1
members of the family had been previously known to own slaves , but so did 12 other presidents , including eight who were still in office			2
@entity14 and his family died year before slavery was outlawed and so his profession would n't have seemed out of place at the time			1
imports : @entity14 , a slave merchant and captain who bought and sold african slaves in the late 1700s , before the @entity89 slave trade was outlawed many @entity134 merchants and @entity9 plantation owners grew rich on the trade that transported more than 10 million @entity137 to @entity138			1
it seems @entity14 was almost as cruel to his fellow sailors as the slaves he bought and sold			2
an account of his death says , ' there could not possibly have been a more inhuman monster than this @entity14			0
many a poor seaman has been brought by him to an untimely end			0
' it might explain why his own crew members held a mutiny shooting him dead and throwing him overboard during a voyage 1797			0
in the present day , on his 2003 visit to @entity72 , a former slave fort off the coast of the @entity74 capital , @entity155 , @entity10 denounced the slave trade as one of ' the greatest crimes of history			2
' ' small men took on the powers and airs of tyrants and masters , ' he said			0
' some have said we should not judge their failures by the standards of a later time			0
yet , in every time , there were men and women who clearly saw this sin and called it by name			0
' the @entity11 family 's spokesman in @entity177 , @entity178 , had no comment on the findings and the @entity181 in @entity182 as also not commented on the findings .			1

ancestral link between @entity11 family and slave trade confirmed
twelve @entity9 presidents owned slaves
it was already known @entity14 was an ancestor of the @entity11 's but only just confirmed he bought and sold slaves
in the late 1700s , owning slaves was n't outlawed nor *unusual*
first time an ancestor of @entity11 has been directly linked to the brutal trans - @entity89 slave trade
