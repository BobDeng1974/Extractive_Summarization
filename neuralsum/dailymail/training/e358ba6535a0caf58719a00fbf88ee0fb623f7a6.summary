by @entity0 fish oils could hold the key to saving pensioners ’ sight			0
@entity7 fatty acids , abundant in oily fish , help stop tiny blood vessels from bleeding into the back of the eye , experiments show			1
the finding is important because damage to retinal blood is behind a range of conditions that can lead to loss of sight , including many cases of age - related macular degeneration ( @entity20 ) , the most common cause of blindness in the elderly			1
the finding is important because damage to retinal blood is behind a range of conditions that can lead to loss of sight ( file photo ) @entity20 affects more than 600,000 @entity29 and the number is expected to treble in the next 25 years as the population ages			1
there are few treatments – and no cure – for the condition			0
the research , from @entity37 , focused on ‘ wet @entity20 ’ , the most serious form , in which central vision can be lost within months			2
in the study , a diet rich in @entity7 cut damage to the blood vessels in mice with an @entity20 - like eye disease			1
the healthy fats , which are found in mackerel , trout , herring , sardines , tuna and salmon , stopped damaging immune cells from fuelling the disease , the journal @entity48 reports			2

with existing drugs expensive , injected directly into the eye and not effective in all cases , the researchers said that there is an urgent need for new treatments			0
dr @entity58 said that given the prevalence of @entity20 and a related form of blindness in diabetics , the ‘ potential impact of this study is highly significant ’			1
patients with other diseases fed by rogue blood vessels , such as cancer , may also benefit from the knowledge			1
dr @entity58 added : ‘ it is our hope that future studies will allow us to develop specific therapeutics that harness this knowledge , resulting in greater visual outcome and quality of life for patients suffering from these sight - threatening diseases			0
’ in the meantime , he advises that everyone eat oily fish or take omega - 3 supplements for all - round health			0
