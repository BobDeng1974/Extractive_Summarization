by @entity0 @entity2 's family can never forget what it 's like to be targeted by racists			1
someone wrote the n - word in fire in the garden of their home , their dog was poisoned and there was a concerted campaign to get them out			1
and this was n't in the racial cauldron of @entity20 's @entity19 , but in the very liberal state of @entity22			2
@entity2 was born into a deeply segregated society in @entity24 , yet thanks to his huge talent he rose to prominence , overcoming hatred and bigotry from white supremacists			1
it is nearly 50 years since @entity2 died of lung cancer aged just 45 , but today his three daughters are here to retell their story and introduce a new generation to their father 's courage – and music			1
@entity40 , who followed her father into singing , says she hopes to bring home to people the truly shocking extent of the prejudice they – and all black people – had to face			1
@entity40 wants to retell their story and introduce a new generation to her father 's courage and music			2
' my parents tried to shield us from a lot of what was going on , but i remember one night when some people were letting off firecrackers in the rose bushes , ' says @entity40 , when i meet her and her younger sisters , twins @entity62 and @entity64 in @entity65			1
' my mum went outside with a rolled - up newspaper to threaten them			1
' and when my father was headlining in cabaret at the @entity71 in @entity72 we were n't allowed a room there because of our colour			2
we all had to stay at a little motel , including @entity77			2
back home , our @entity79 dog mr @entity2 died after eating poisoned meat that had been thrown over the fence			1
' @entity2 was born in @entity84 , @entity24 , in 1919 but his pastor father moved the family to @entity87 when he was four to give them a better life than in the colour - segregated @entity91 states , which were dominated by the viciously racist @entity92			1
@entity2 giving daughter @entity40 , then aged seven , a music lesson in 1956 he showed a prodigious talent for music from a young age and was soon regarded as one of the nation 's best jazz pianists – he was nicknamed ' @entity101 because of the old nursery rhyme and it stuck			1
he first had success with the @entity2 but it was when he started singing that the group really began to do well			1
the hits kept coming : the @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 are all still loved around the world			2
@entity2 would have been happy concentrating on his music but doing so as an equal to @entity114 – his great friend and chart rival – was impossible			1
even when , like @entity114 , @entity2 was performing in the big hotels , not only was he not allowed to stay there but he could n't use the pool or even cross the casino floor			1
for many years he kept his head down ; did n't complain and played to segregated or whites - only audiences			1
he even agreed to wear make - up to lighten up his skin for tv appearances so as not to offend white viewers			1
but still he was attacked			2
in 1948 he married his second wife @entity128 , the mother of @entity40 , @entity62 and @entity64 as well as two children they adopted			2
when they bought their first house together in smart @entity135 , @entity136 , they were the first black family in the neighbourhood and many tried to hound them out			2
as well as the fire and the dog poisoning , the girls were rejected by the local school			1
all the neighbours had @entity2 's albums but no one wanted him living next door			1
a committee of property owners complained to him , ' we do n't want any undesirables moving in			2
' he retorted , ' neither do i. and if i see anybody undesirable coming in here , i 'll be the first to complain			2
' ' our father was a reluctant star , he loved what he did but did n't anticipate the success or the issues			1
he was n't trying to be a pioneer but his success turned into something bigger than he was ' i ask his daughters why he stayed			1
says @entity64 , ' it was our mother			0
she wanted to raise the bar			0
that was the house she wanted and no one was going to push her out			0
she was also very light - skinned , which was a great advantage			1
she 'd never really experienced racism before that			1
' adds @entity40 with a laugh , ' she never let anyone tell her what to do			0
she was a sophisticated lady who 'd been to finishing school in @entity179 and as far as she was concerned she had more class and breeding than any of the people trying to push her out			1
' @entity2 was to remain a reluctant figurehead of the civil rights movement when in 1956 he became the first black host of a nationally syndicated tv show ; the @entity188			1
from the start the show struggled to attract sponsors so friends including @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 agreed to appear for free			0
but white viewers in the @entity19 , outraged at seeing a black man hosting a tv show , pressured the sponsors and advertisers to drop their funding of it			1
after just a year @entity2 was forced to pull the plug saying ' @entity205 ( the @entity207 headquarters of the big advertising agencies ) is afraid of the dark			1
' a recent tv documentary about his life – which included telling anecdotes from @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity213 , who regarded @entity2 as his hero – had this story at its heart			1
@entity2 with wife @entity128 and daughters @entity40 and @entity218 and son @entity219 at @entity65 's @entity220 in 1960 ' our father was a reluctant star , ' says @entity40			1
' he loved what he did but did n't anticipate the success or the issues			2
he was n't trying to be a pioneer but his success turned into something bigger than he was			2
a lot of white folks could n't get their brain around a black guy having his own show			2
they resented the fact that he was gifted and talented – but black			0
' he paved the way for @entity237 and @entity238 and all the young stars of today			0
but there was a lot of psychological stress and hardship			2
when he lost the show i think it made him sick			0
he hardly ever said a mean word or got angry			0
i think that 's why he got ulcers			0
' he was also coming under pressure from the black community to stand up to segregation			0
' they were outraged when he continued to perform in front of segregated audiences saying , ' i ca n't change the situation in a day			0
' though he 'd given money to groups campaigning in the @entity19 against segregation he was called an @entity260 , a traitor to his colour			1
' our father was a gentle giant , ' says @entity62			0
' he spoke through his music and he was often criticised for that			0
you have to pick your battles			0
today everyone would be sucking up to him but it was a different world			0
he had to suck up to them			0
' ' he paved the way for @entity237 and @entity238 and all the young stars of today			0
' @entity40 , the only one of @entity2 's children to follow him into a singing career – @entity277 educated @entity62 and @entity64 both went into pr and now run a charity in their father 's name – can empathise from her own experiences			1
' when i was just starting out in the 1970s i was in @entity24 with a group of people , ' she recalls			2
' we went to a restaurant and they refused to serve us			0
we were shocked ; this was the 1970s			0
a sheriff came but only to tell us to move on			0
' @entity2 's life was cut short cruelly early			1
a heavy smoker , he was diagnosed with lung cancer in december 1964 and died two months later			0
@entity40 , now 64 , looks at her feet as she thinks about how , as a vulnerable 15 - year - old , she numbed the pain of her beloved father 's death with drugs			2
' losing @entity77 set me into a whole whirling dervish of stuff , ' she says sadly			0
' @entity303 was one of the things i did – my mother went mad , she said , " you could n't have loved your father if you 're smoking "			0
but i only stopped seven or eight years ago			0
' for @entity62 and @entity64 , who are 11 years younger , it 's hard to know what are memories of their father , and what are things they have been told			0
' it 's sad to think we did n't get to know him , ' says @entity64			0
' it 's bittersweet because we 've learned about who our father is through photographs and his music			0
' all three think it 's important to keep their father 's legacy going			0
' @entity77 was one of a kind , ' says @entity40 with a smile			0
' there will never be another @entity2			1
they were n't expecting it when he showed up			0
he was such a classy lovely man , coming out of the @entity19 fairly uneducated , with this gift			0
he captivated the world with his voice			0
' @entity2 's @entity337 album is out now on @entity338 .			1
