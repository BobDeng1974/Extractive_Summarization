with the rebels now apparently losing ground by the day to government forces and with the leadership of @entity21 president @entity276 likely to be keen for a victory by @entity278 next sunday , it is doubtful @entity99 sees any advantage in agreeing to a ceasefire now			0
earlier , @entity28 's top commander warned that any @entity31 bid to infiltrate its soldiers into an alliance member country will immediately trigger a ' military response '			0
