by @entity0 published : 22:37 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 07:52 est , 5 july 2012 inconsolable : the mother of a four - year - old girl raped at home by a teenage babysitter says she regularly breaks down in tears the mother of a four - year - old girl raped by a teenage babysitter has revealed the pain that has haunted her since the horrific ordeal			1
the woman said there are days when she ' ca n't stop crying ' after discovering her daughter had been assaulted by the 14 - year - old son of a family friend			2
and the father is tormented by feelings of guilt for allowing the toddler to be left in the clutches of the disturbed babysitter			1
speaking publicly for the first time since the attacker walked free from court , the couple blasted the decision not to impose a custodial sentence - and feared their daughter could bump into her rapist any day			1
instead , the judge imposed a three - year community order after blaming ‘ the world and society ’ for his exposure to porn			0
' our daughter was just four years old and so small for her age , she was still wearing age two to three clothing			1
he was a lot bigger than her , ' the distressed mother told the @entity46 she said that when her daughter - who can not be identified for legal reasons - told her what had happened she ' was sick ' then fell to the floor crying			1
the teenager used the toddler 's favourite @entity54 apron to blindfold her while he carried out the attack - promising her chocolate if she played his ' game '			1
the mother said the first chilling sign that something ' terrible ' had happened was when she returned home and noticed the apron was n't hanging in its usual place , but was scrunched up on the floor			1
still numb from what happened , she added : ' there have been days where i just ca n’t stop bursting into tears and i feel sick all the time			1
i ca n’t cope any more			0
' her daughter , who is now five , knows ' something horrible ' happened but does n't understand what			1
the girl is likely to have counselling as she grows up to deal with the long - term effects of the ordeal , but both parents are ' worried ' about what her future now holds			2
the girl 's father , a businessman in his 40s , told how they went to watch their older child in school play while leaving the younger daughter with the boy , who they trusted and had known a long time			1
attack : the teenager raped the girl in her home while he was babysitting her			1
he used the girl 's @entity54 apron to blindfold her as he carried out the attack ( file picture posed by model ) corrupted : the teenager told officers that he had lost his mind because ' hormones had taken over '			1
@entity103 heard how he watched internet pornography every day when the parents returned home nothing seemed out of the ordinary and they paid the babysitter £ 10 and he left it was only when the father was getting his daughter ready for bed that she told him what happened			1
the @entity116 's @entity115 campaign has called for the introduction of ‘ opt - in ’ systems , under which internet service providers would automatically block pornography unless an adult asked for it to be available			2
there is growing alarm about the impact of sexual content on the internet on @entity129 ’s children			0
just three per cent of pornographic websites require proof of age before granting access to sexually explicit material , and research suggests as many as one in three under - tens has seen pornography online			2
the @entity139 angered campaigners earlier this year by suggesting it was ruling out the idea of an automatic block on porn , on civil liberties grounds			0
but following the @entity116 ’s campaign , ministers have now included questions about the opt - in system in a public consultation document , launched last week on the department ’s website			0
he stormed over to the boy 's home , just a few hundred yards down the road , and told his mother what the girl had said			1
together they confronted the teenager who denied the girl 's claims - saying that she had walked in on him in the bathroom and had seen him exposed			2
but when the concerned father returned home and spoke to his daughter once more it became apparent that the boy was lying and the police were called			2
the teenager admitted the offence to officers the following day - telling them that he had lost his mind because ' hormones ' had taken over			0
' i should want to rip this boy 's head off - but i think i let my daughter down , ' the guilt - ridden father said			1
' i blame myself because i left her in a room with him and made the wrong judgment			2
' he said that even when his little girl tells him he 's the best dad in the world , he does n't believe it anymore			2
the teenager - who still lives a few hundred yards from the victim - wore his school uniform in the dock at @entity103 on monday as judge @entity194 told him he would have received a six - and - a - half year jail term if he had been an adult			0
judge @entity194 said : ‘ you have not shown any particular sexual interest in children			0
i ’m satisfied it was impulsive and i believe you have become sexualised by your exposure to and the corruption of pornography			0
‘ your exposure at such a young age has ended in tragedy			2
it was the fault of the world and society			0
’ the boy told police who were interviewing that he had regularly accessed porn on the internet at his parents ’ home without their knowledge			0
in court he admitted raping a girl under 13			0
the mother of the victim says the judge justified the lenient sentence by making a ' cheap point ' to use pornography as an excuse for what happened			1
she said the family of the teenager had been expecting him to receive a custodial sentence of three years and were shocked that he had walked free from court			1
the sentence ' just is n't enough ' as it sends the ' wrong message ' about rape and could prevent other victims from coming forward , she added			1
the @entity116 is calling for an automatic block under which adult content would be filtered out by default			0
users would have to opt in to see it			0
' corrupting influence ' : judge @entity194 accepted said the boy had become sexualised by his exposure to and the corruption of pornography ( picture right posed by model ) the teenager wore his school uniform in the dock at @entity103 , pictured , on monday as he was told he would have received a six - and - a - half year jail term if he had been an adult the campaign has attracted the support of deputy children ’s commissioner @entity254 and @entity255 , whose schoolgirl daughter @entity256 was murdered by paedophile @entity257			0
@entity259 mp @entity258 , leader of an all - party group of mps campaigning against open access to porn , said the rape case proved the ‘ serious negative impacts ’ such images can have on children ’s lives			0
' i believe an “ opt - in ” model , along with better education and awareness , would provide the best tools for parents to protect their children online , ’ she said			0
@entity277 of the @entity278 said : ‘ this case underlines why we want a system where adults have to actively opt in to get access to internet pornography			0

@entity286 knew something was wrong after seeing daughter 's @entity54 apron scrunched up on the floor

' our daughter was so small for her age , she was still wearing age two to three clothing . i was sick after what happened . '
