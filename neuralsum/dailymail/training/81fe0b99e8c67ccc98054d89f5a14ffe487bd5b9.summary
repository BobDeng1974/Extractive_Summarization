@entity0 was in serious danger of losing her sight as her eyes were starved of oxygen after finally getting round to having a routine check - up for her contact lenses , @entity0 assumed it would be merely a formality			1
having worn contacts since the age of 14 , the 33 - year - old fashion designer from @entity9 had never experienced any problems with them			1
the general advice is to avoid wearing contacts for more than eight hours a day			1
however @entity0 , like many people , had been wearing them for much longer - in her case , for more than 14 hours every day			1
this had slowly been starving her eyes of oxygen ; while the damage was n't apparent to the naked eye , it was spotted when the optometrist used a special microscope			1
@entity0 was shocked to learn that she was in serious danger of losing her sight			1
' i was horrified , ' recalls @entity0 , from @entity9			1
' i 'd always worn my lenses from 7 am until nearly midnight			2
nobody had told me that i was jeopardising my sight by wearing them for so long , though i suppose i just said i used them daily			1
' what frightened me even more was that there had been no signs anything was wrong - my eyes looked the same			1
and i 'd delayed my annual check - up by several weeks because i was so busy and i did n't think i really needed one			2
' around 3.7 million people in @entity42 wear contact lenses			1
but many do n't appreciate how meticulous you need to be about using them , says @entity47 , a consultant ophthalmic surgeon at @entity48 and @entity49 @entity48			2
one of the risks is corneal neovascularisation , the condition @entity0 had			1
as mr @entity47 explains : ' the cornea - the clear outer layer at the front of the eyeball - is the only part of the body that gets its oxygen supply directly from the air rather than from the blood			1
' but a contact lens acts as a barrier to that oxygen supply , so extensive wear can potentially starve the cornea of oxygen			1
' the body compensates for this by growing new blood vessels over the cornea to provide an oxygen supply , or corneal neovascularisation			1
' left unchecked , the eye can become covered with blood vessels , and turn the cornea opaque			2
in rare cases it can threaten sight			0
' the problem is the condition can build up over several years - it 's only when it gets to an advanced stage that contacts wearers become aware of a problem , as that 's when it will cause red , irritated eyes , by which time it may be too late			1
the general advice is to avoid wearing contacts for more than eight hours a day stopping wearing the lenses can cause the new blood vessels to collapse , though in severe cases , when there is excessive blood vessel growth , even if they collapse , they can cause scarring			1
@entity93 may be more common with standard soft lenses , which are made of water - containing plastic			0
the other main type of lens , gas permeable , while less flexible , allows in more oxygen , says @entity100 , a @entity101 - based optometrist			1
' there are also newer types of soft lenses , known as silicone hydrogels , which allow more oxygen to pass through to the cornea than previous soft lens materials , making them healthier , ' he @entity102 are lenses licensed for use during sleep , which are permeable enough to ensure there is minimal risk of corneal neovascularisation			1
but you should be assessed by an optometrist before using these			0
it 's not only corneal neovascularisation that 's the problem with wearing contacts for too long			1
@entity122 , 27 , says her big , round blue eyes , which she once considered her best feature , have been ruined through wearing contact lenses for more than ten hours a day , as the whites of her eyes are now often red and sore			1
she 's worn contacts since she was 14 , then four years ago she began suffering eye infections every few months			1
' if i was awake i 'd wear lenses , ' says @entity122 , who lives in @entity132 and works in a bar			2
' but every few months my eyes would become red and painful			2
i 'd leave the lenses for a couple of days and they 'd settle down			0
but the cycle would repeat itself			0
' eventually , she saw her optician , who immediately referred her to a specialist at @entity141 in @entity142 , where she was diagnosed with blepharitis - inflammation of the eyelids - aggravated by wearing her contacts for too long every day			1
@entity147 causes reddening of the whites of the eye as the inflamed lids scratch the surface			0
people wearing contacts are at much higher risk of blephar-itis , as the eye is more likely to be dry and prone to irritation			2
@entity147 can not usually be cured , but the symptoms can be controlled by regularly cleaning the eye with boiled water ( after it has cooled ) and massaging it when closed to prevent deposits of sticky discharge and flakes of skin building up behind the lid			0
she delayed an annual check - up and did n't think she really needed one a few weeks after she discarded her lenses , as advised , @entity122 's eyes began to lose most of their redness			2
' but four years later , my eyes are still red in the corners and i felt i 've really ruined my eyes by wearing contact lenses , ' she says			2
it 's not only overuse of contact lenses that can threaten the health of the eye - carelessness with hygiene is an obvious problem			0
and , ironically , some patients think they are practising good hygeine but are n't , explains @entity185 , consultant ophthalmic surgeon and corneal specialist at @entity187			0
' most people tend to wash their hands in the bathroom before putting in their lenses			0
but many are unaware that unless they dry their hands properly or if they leave their contact lenses uncovered in their case , they 're potentially exposing themselves to a bug known as acanthamoeba			0
this lives in water tanks , which tend to provide the supply to bathrooms			0
as such it can be found on bathroom surfaces too			0
' @entity204 bugs stick to contact lenses and can then burrow their way through the cornea , causing acute pain			0
it 's only at this stage that a sufferer would be aware they had a problem			0
prescription drugs may be able to treat the bug in the early stages , but specialists say it is very difficult to get rid of			0
in serious cases , the patient needs a corneal transplant but these have a high failure rate , resulting in sight loss			0
other steps to prevent the infection include never swimming or using a hot tub or shower when wearing contacts , advises @entity229 , consultant ophthalmic surgeon at the @entity230			2
' and never hold them under running water			0
' each year , infections cause around 6,000 cases of a severe eye condition known as microbial keratitis - inflammation and ulceration of the cornea that can lead to vision loss			0
contact lens wearers are at a higher risk , since bacteria can get trapped in the lenses			0
so how should you protect your eyes ? mr @entity229 recommends using daily disposable lenses , which are usually more expensive as each new lens will be sterile and will never need to be cleaned			1
if you do use monthlies - these are taken out and cleaned every night , and replaced after a month - rub them with the solution recommended by your optometrist before putting them in their case			2
the lens case should also be replaced every month , adds mr @entity100			0
' over time , cracks can form in which micro-organisms can thrive , leading to infection			0
' the number of years since contact lenses were invented and never reuse or top up disinfecting solution - put fresh solution in the case every time you take the lenses out , says mr @entity100			0
rinse the storage case and leave it open to dry after use every day and clean it once a week with a clean toothbrush and contact lens solution			2
but the most important thing is to try to limit lens use to eight hours a day and keep hands scrupulously clean , says mr @entity47			1
' break the habit of wearing lenses from the moment you wake up until you go to bed - when you get home from work , switch to glasses in order to allow the eye 's oxygen intake to get back to normal			2
or , if you have a social event , do this the other way round			0
' as for @entity0 , she feels she has had a lucky escape			1
she was advised by her optician at @entity293 to stop wearing her lenses immediately - and for good			0
once she stopped , within a few months the tiny blood vessels had collapsed and were no longer a threat to her vision			0
but she struggled wearing glasses - after years of wearing lenses they made her feel dizzy when she glanced to the side - and she decided to have laser treatment to correct her vision			0
' now i have 20/20 vision , but i still shudder to think i could have ended up losing my sight simply from wearing my contact lenses for much too long every day			1

fashion designer @entity0 , 33 , from @entity9 wore contacts daily
up to 8 hours wear a day is recommended but she wore them for 14
she was in danger of losing *eyesight* as was starving her eyes of oxygen
