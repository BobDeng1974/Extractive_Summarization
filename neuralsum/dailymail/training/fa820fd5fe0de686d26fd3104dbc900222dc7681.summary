by @entity0 the submarine cable network is a complex structure that stretches for more than half a million miles beneath our oceans			2
current maps of the network are complicated and hard to follow , so to simplify this behemoth , designers transformed it into a line and node graph that looks remarkably like @entity13 's iconic tube map			1
using data taken from @entity16 , each country is plotted as a station , and the connecting lines are colour - coded based on which consortium owns that stretch of cable			1
hover your mouse over the map below to explore the network the @entity26 , pictured , uses data taken from @entity16 and was created by the @entity28			1
each station , or node , on the map represents a country , and all nodes within in the same country are combined into a single node a submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land - based stations			1
it is laid by specially designed ships that can carry thousands of miles of coiled cable in their holds and can lay it as it travels across the ocean			2
the first commercial cables were laid in 1850 to send telegraphy traffic			0
since then the cables have been used to send telephone traffic , and most recently data traffic			1
many of the modern cables are made of fibre optic			0
trial cables were laid in 1842 in @entity56 harbour and were insulated with tarred hemp and rubber			0
nowadays , cables are protected using polyethylene			0
traditionally the cables were owned by service providers , yet websites have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks including @entity66 and @entity67			0
the network carries almost 95 per cent of the internet we use every day			2
any stations within the same country have been combined into a single node , and many short links were deliberately excluded to make the visualisation simpler			1
for example , it does n’t show the intricate network of cables under the waters of the @entity81			0
countries recently listed as enemies of the @entity26 , in the 2014 report of @entity85 - due to censorship and surveillance laws - are highlighted , too			1
a key on the right - hand side of the map reveals what the icons and colours mean			1
the centrality of each station was calculated using @entity99 - an algorithm search engines use to highlight how authoritative a website is , for example			1
on the @entity26 , this authority translates to regions where the network is most influenced by governments , or susceptible to weakness and disruption			1
in creating the map , researchers @entity106 and @entity108 from the @entity28 discovered the @entity110 is the most connected country in the world , with cable landing at points along both coasts			1
the connecting lines are colour - coded based on which consortium owns that stretch of cable			1
countries were recently listed as enemies of the @entity26 , in the @entity85 report - due to censorship and surveillance laws - are highlighted			1
a key , pictured , reveals what the icons and colours mean the map uses data taken from @entity16 , pictured			1
the @entity110 is the most connected country in the world , with cable landing at points along both coasts			1
the second and third most central parts of the global network are located in the @entity132 and @entity133 on the other side of the @entity136 , the second and third most central parts of the global network are located in the @entity132 and @entity133			0
the @entity132 has been a pioneer in laying submarine cables since the second half of the 19th century , and still controlled almost half of the world ’s submarine cables in the 1920s			0
@entity133 is where most of the southern @entity136 cables land , and it will be followed by @entity146 when new cables are switched on in the region later this year			0
looking at the network more closely , @entity150 in @entity151 is the world ’s most central node , immediately followed by @entity155 and @entity156 in the @entity157			0
click the interactive map below to explore a more detailed version of the cable network in january , @entity162 - based firm @entity161 plotted all of these cables on a much more detailed interactive map , pictured , that similarly reveals who owns the networks , their landing points and how far these cables can stretch the city of @entity171 in @entity172 , and the town of @entity174 in @entity175 , are the most central single points in @entity177 and @entity178 respectively , while @entity179 in @entity180 dominates the @entity182 list			1
' the importance of being central in the submarine fibre - optic cable network is twofold , ' explained the researchers			1
' on the one hand , internet users in central countries tend to have faster and cheaper connections to the @entity26 - there are no countries with low - cost internet access that are n’t also relatively well - connected			1
' but we ’ve also seen how certain central countries in the network have a history of engaging in surveillance of onternet traffic : as revealed by @entity199 and described by the @entity200 and the @entity201 , for both internal and foreign surveillance			2
' in january , @entity162 - based firm @entity161 plotted all of these cables on a much more detailed , interactive map that similarly reveals who owns the networks , their landing points and how far these cables can stretch			1
@entity161 's @entity209 , pictured , was updated for 2014 and features a total of 285 cable networks			2
of this 285 , 263 are currently in service , while 22 should be in use by the end of 2015			0
it was based on data from @entity217 selecting a cable on the map , pictured , or from the submarine cable list , shows details of the cable 's name , ready - for - service ( @entity225 ) date , length , owners , website , and landing points in 2006 , submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic - an increase of 94 per cent in just eight years , according to official figures from the @entity234			1
since 2012 , the amount of submarine cables have almost doubled from 150 to the current figure of 285			0
of this 285 , 263 cables are currently in use , while 22 are set to be in use by the end of 2015			0
when a cable is laid but not in use it is called a ' dark ' cable , but once in use it becomes ' lit '			2
@entity161 ’s interactive @entity209 was created using data from @entity217			2
it shows active and planned submarine cable systems and their landing stations			2
selecting a cable on the map , or from the submarine cable list , reveals details of the cable ’s name , ready - for - service ( @entity225 ) date , length , owners , website , and landing points			1
a submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land - based stations			1

traditionally the cables were owned by service providers , yet websites have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks			0
for example , @entity66 is part of the consortium that manages the @entity279 - @entity278 cable , left , and @entity67 is part of the consortium that manages the @entity282 , right the first cables were laid in 1850 to send telegraphy traffic			1
since then they have been used to send telephone traffic , and most recently data			1
this map shows how the @entity290 's network looked in 1901			2
in 2006 , submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic , this figure is now around 95 per cent there is only a limited amount of space for cable on land , and this makes the space expensive to rent , and highly competitive			2
since 1850 engineers and telecom companies , instead , have been taking advantage of the vast land beneath the oceans to lay cables			0
the first cables were used to send telegraphy traffic			0
since then the cables have been used to send telephone traffic , and most recently data traffic			2
many of the modern cables are made of fibre optic , to increase the size and speed at which the information can be sent , and are only 2 - inches thick			0
trial cables were laid in 1842 in @entity56 harbour and were insulated with tarred hemp and rubber			0
nowadays , cables are protected using polyethylene			0
traditionally the cables were owned by service providers , yet websites have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks			0
this image shows a cross section of a modern submarine communications cable			0
it is around 2 - inches thick			0
the labels are : ( 1 ) @entity333 , ( 2 ) mylar tape , ( 3 ) stranded steel wires , ( 4 ) aluminium water barrier , ( 5 ) @entity337 , ( 6 ) copper or aluminium tube , ( 7 ) @entity340 and ( 8 ) optical fibres for example , @entity66 is part of the consortium that manages the @entity279 - @entity278 cable , and @entity67 is part of the consortium that manages the @entity282			1
reports in december stated that by owning private networks the companies can stop governments from being able to track what they get up to			0
as of 2010 , submarine cables link all the world 's continents except @entity357			0
cables can be broken by fishing trawlers , anchors , earthquakes , turbidity currents , and even shark bites			0
if cables need to fixed , a repair ship will drop a buoy in the location of the break and a submersible is sent down to repair them .			0

the internet tube map uses data taken from @entity16
each country is plotted as a station and the connecting lines are colour - coded based on which consortium owns that stretch of cable
countries recently listed as ' enemies of the @entity26 ' are highlighted too
shorter links are excluded to make the map easier to follow
