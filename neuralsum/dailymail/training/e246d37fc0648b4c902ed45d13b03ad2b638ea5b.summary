' @entity9 inspect a shop damaged after a drone crashed into a communication station in @entity59 @entity219 militants contend that the drone , which crashed in the early hours of this morning , belonged to the @entity5 while lawmakers from both political parties agree that @entity0 needs to go on offense against @entity53 in both @entity119 and @entity9 , there 's no consensus on @entity0 's ability to continue strikes in @entity119 beyond october 7 without first receiving approval from @entity47			1
on that day the president 's authority to engage in military action in the country under the @entity233 will expire			1

resistance to @entity0 using the 13 - year - old @entity241 cuts across party lines in @entity47 , with top dems like @entity30 armed services ranking member @entity268 and libertarians like sen. @entity271 siding against the @entity30			2
