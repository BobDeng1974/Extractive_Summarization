a ' supervolcano ' eruption is the most catastrophic natural disaster that can hit our planet , short of an asteroid impact - and scientists now believe @entity8 's @entity7 is more active than we thought			1
two million years ago , an eruption of the supervolcano darkened the skies with ash from southern @entity13 to the @entity14 , releasing more than 500 cubic miles of ash into the sky			1
now scientists believe that it was followed by a second eruption , around 6,000 years later - leading to fears ' explosive volcanism ' from @entity7 is more common than scientists thought			1
@entity24 erupts this year : two million years ago , an eruption of the @entity7 supervolcano darkened the skies with ash from southern @entity13 to the @entity14 , releasing more than 500 cubic miles of ash into the sky @entity30 and sunrise @entity32 @entity31 : researchers now believe that the huge ' supervolcano ' beneath the park is far more active than previously thought researchers at @entity38 and the @entity39 say the biggest @entity7 eruption , which created the 2 million year old @entity42 deposit , was actually two different eruptions at least 6,000 years apart			1
‘ the @entity7 ’s previous behavior is the best guide of what it will do in the future , ’ says @entity44 , co-author and post-doctoral researcher at @entity38 ’s @entity46			1
‘ this research suggests explosive volcanism from @entity7 is more frequent than previously thought			1
’ the eruption of super-volcanoes dwarfs the eruptions of recent volcanoes and can trigger planetary climate change by inducing @entity59 and other impacts			1
one such event was the @entity42 eruption of present - day @entity32 about two million years ago , which was more than 2,000 times larger than the 1980 eruption of @entity65 in @entity66			2
short of a meteor impact , these super-eruptions are the worst environmental hazards our planet can face			0
their results paint a new picture of a more active volcano than previously thought and can help recalibrate the likelihood of another big eruption in the future			1
before the researchers split the one eruption into two , it was the fourth largest known to science			2

researchers now believe that the supervolcano beneath the park could be more active than thought a car tries to outrun the dust cloud from a supervolcano in a documentary about the effects of an eruption the new ages for each @entity42 eruption reduce the volume of the first event to 2,200 cubic kilometers , roughly 12 percent less than previously thought			2
a second eruption of 290 cubic kilometers took place more than 6,000 years later			2
that first eruption still deserves to be called ‘ super , ’ as it is one of the largest known to have occurred on @entity102 and darkened the skies with ash from southern @entity13 to the @entity14			1
by comparison , the 1980 eruption of @entity65 produced 1 cubic kilometer of ash			2
the larger blast of @entity110 ’s @entity109 6,850 years ago produced 116 cubic kilometers of ash			0
a @entity113 documentary imagines what might happen were the supervolcano under @entity7 to erupt again - the red area is the huge ash cloud unleashed by the eruption the study , funded by the @entity120 and published in the june issue of the @entity122 , used high - precision argon isotope dating to make the new calculations			1
the radioactive decay rate from potassium 40 to argon 40 serves as a ‘ rock clock ’ for dating samples and has a precision of .2 percent			0
@entity130 , co-author and a post-doctoral research fellow at the @entity39 , recently helped fine tune the technique and improve it by 1.2 percent — a small - sounding difference that can become huge across geologic time			0
‘ improved precision for greater temporal resolution is not just about adding another decimal place to a number , says @entity130			0
‘ it 's far more exciting			0
it 's like getting a sharper lens on a camera			0
it allows us to see the world more clearly			0
’ the project asks the question : might super-eruptions actually be products of multiple , closely spaced eruptions through time ? with improved temporal resolution , in times to come , maybe super-eruptions will be not quite so super .			0
