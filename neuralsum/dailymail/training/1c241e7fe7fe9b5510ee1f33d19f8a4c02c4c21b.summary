when the killing first burst onto @entity3 tv screens in 2011 , few expected it to be a hit			0
but despite low expectations , a hit it proved and so a cult classic was born			0
now one of the stars of season two , @entity10 , 41 , is back with another @entity15 drama and it promises to be just as tense ( and heavy on the stylish knitwear ) as its predecessors			1
starring @entity20 and @entity21 - an actress dubbed @entity23 's answer to @entity24 - as two of four warring siblings , @entity19 takes an uncomfortably close look at the dynamics of a defiantly dysfunctional family			1
@entity23 's @entity24 : @entity21 , 42 , stars in new @entity31 thriller , the legacy while it might sound like a relatively simple concept , in true @entity31 style , the plot has more twists and turns than a labyrinth plus enough red herrings to feed the population of @entity23 for a year			1
' it 's a story about secrets , lies , tension and love , ' explains @entity10			2
' everyone can relate to being a brother or a sister or a daughter and all of those perspectives are covered in the show			0
it makes it very easy to connect with the characters along the way			0
' not that the majority of us would want to connect with any of the by turns angry , manipulative and dark characters in real life			0
@entity62 's is @entity63 , the estranged son of matriarch @entity64 and a man who manages to combine a semi-detached character with not always well hidden anger			0
starring role : @entity10 ( far left ) will be familiar to fans of @entity70 and plays @entity63 familiar face : @entity21 starred alongside @entity73 in 2012 's @entity72 other family members include @entity75 , the daughter given up for adoption who becomes the sole beneficiary of @entity64 's will - and thus the target of everyone else 's anger - and @entity63 's sister @entity81 - played by @entity23 's answer to @entity24 , @entity21			1
' i really love this character because she 's really complex and she 's not likeable all the time , ' explains the 42 - year - old of her art - loving character			1
' i like that you have space and room to get all the nuances			0
i like that none of the characters deserve sympathy but in other ways , they all do			0
' @entity21 is no stranger to a complex family saga , having earned plaudits for her deft handling of the role of @entity102 in the fiendishly complex royal romance , @entity103 , in 2012			1
more recently , she has starred in a series of tense thrillers , among them @entity19 , but also creepy @entity108 indie flick , who am i – no system is safe			2
all this has led to her being compared to the @entity3 's own @entity24 ; a comparison which she says - 20 year age gap between her and @entity115 notwithstanding - is something she delights in			1
' well , i do n't mind that title , ' she chuckles			0
' i 'm a big fan of hers so its an honour to be compared to her			0
tense : her latest role is as art - loving @entity123 who is devastated by the death of her mother tense : @entity81 is infuriated to discover that her mother has left the family home to a hitherto unknown sibling ' i 'm just interested in good work and i started out when i was pretty young and i 've been privileged to work on some brilliant films and i try to challenge and develop myself			2
i see @entity24 as someone to work towards			2
' that she has had so much good work is testament , in part , to the @entity15 love of a strong female lead along the lines of @entity70 and @entity138 - something that @entity21 is grateful for			1
' we have long had a tradition for complex and interesting female parts , ' she smiles			0
' all the characters in @entity15 dramas tend to be quite complex			2
' i 'm aware , though , that we 're standing on the shoulders of all the other series that have been popular in @entity23 and abroad			2
' if it had n't been for @entity70 and @entity148 , we would n't be able to move on to do all the things that we do			0
' and no one knows that better than @entity10 , whose fledgling career got a shot in the arm when he landed the part of @entity155 , a soldier intent on appropriating his junior colleague 's wife , in the second series of @entity70			1
popular : the @entity70 became a huge hit in the @entity3 and elsewhere when it was released in 2011 hit : according to makers @entity163 , the legacy was even more popular in @entity23 than @entity70 and @entity165 fascinating : @entity10 says @entity3 find @entity15 life exotic - hence the success of @entity15 tv series ' i was n't in @entity170 when @entity70 came out , so it was only when we made the @entity19 that i realised how much people loved it , ' he says , pleased			1
' i think it 's good that we , as a small country , can produce dramas that so many people around the world love			0
i 'm proud of that			0
' i think @entity23 is having a golden age for drama , ' he adds			2
' i do n't want to jinx anything but it would be a shame not to admit that - as long as it lasts anyway ! ' but while it was the killing that made his name , @entity10 wants the legacy to do even better - and hopes what he describes as a @entity3 ' fascination ' with all things @entity15 will propel it forward			1
' i think @entity23 seems exotic to people from the @entity3 , ' he explains			0
' even though our lives seem similar , there are slight differences that make it exotic for you			0
' there are more than slight differences between @entity3 ( and most @entity15 ) families and the one portrayed in @entity19 though			1
@entity10 does n't think so and says there are even similarities between the dysfunctional @entity207 and his own family			1
' it differs in many ways but there are problems , ' he admits			0
' of course there are ! ' from the @entity216 ( @entity165 ) to @entity217 ( @entity218 , @entity70 ) , the success of @entity15 drama has provided a shot in the arm for the @entity15 tourist industry			1
' @entity15 films and tv series certainly help to brand @entity23 internationally and attract visitors to @entity23 , ' explains @entity23 's @entity225			1
' @entity3 is now the biggest non-scandinavian market for visitors to @entity228 and across the whole of @entity23 , tourists from the @entity3 booked 40.3 per cent more overnight stays in 2013 than in 2009			0
' according to @entity233 's @entity232 2014 , 20 per cent of @entity3 now associate @entity23 with movies and tv series			2
' popular though locations made famous by @entity165 and @entity70 are , @entity19 has more than a few lovely stop - offs of its own , not least the @entity235 ( thorvaldsensmuseum.dk ) where @entity81 spills a glass of champagne during a particularly frustrating moment			1
other top spots associated with the new show include the pretty @entity243 , the glamorous @entity245 art gallery ( denfrie.dk ) where @entity81 works and her @entity248 apartment which is even available to rent via @entity228			0
' the so - called @entity250 wave has painted a somewhat gloomy picture of the @entity15 , ' adds @entity225 , who is keen to prove that the @entity15 are n't quite as glum as @entity19 would have you believe			1
' visitors who want to immerse themselves in @entity23 's gritty ambience might be disappointed but hopefully they will leave with a more romantic , happy and colourful impression of the country			1
' not if @entity21 and @entity10 get their way .			2
