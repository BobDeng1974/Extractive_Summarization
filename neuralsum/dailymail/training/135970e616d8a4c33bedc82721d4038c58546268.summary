scroll down for an interactive map rising : the number of households with four or more cars has risen by 51 per cent in the last decade , according to analysis for the @entity15 by the @entity17 ( stock image ) the organisation said the findings are proof of the ‘ relentless rise of the car ’ and our dependence on it at a time when families are being priced off trains and seeing cuts to local and rural bus services			1
the number of households with three cars is up by nearly a third ( 31.5 per cent ) , while two - car families have increased by 13 per cent			1
overall the number of households with two or more cars is up by nearly a fifth ( 18 per cent )			1
in contrast the number of homes with no car or just one car has grown by less than 4 per cent			0
however , a ‘ real terms ’ assessment showing the number of cars per 1,000 people reveals that the proportion of households with no car has actually fallen by 4.5 per cent			1
those with one car has also dropped , according to this measure , by 3.6 per cent			0
