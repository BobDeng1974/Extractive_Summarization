in the red corner , a high - profile news presenter known for his left - wing opinions and colourful ties			0
in the blue , a @entity7 - based mp very much to the @entity8 of the @entity10 party			2
and as @entity13 became embroiled in a furious shouting match with @entity15 , the @entity12 newsroom turned into their unlikely sparring arena			1
the row – played out in front of 50 journalists – began when ‘ playground bully ’ mr @entity13 confronted mr @entity15 , who was on a tour of the studio , about accusations of political bias			1
backbench @entity10 mp @entity15 was involved in a heated exchange with veteran broadcaster @entity13 on a tour of @entity29 's studios yesterday they traded insults for ten minutes – with mr @entity15 saying mr @entity13 was ‘ past it ’ – before fellow presenter @entity32 waded in and told their visitor to ‘ clear off ’			1
as the dust settled last night , each side blamed the other for the undignified scene			0
mr @entity13 ’s colleagues claimed he had acted ‘ perfectly reasonably ’ after being subjected to a ‘ personal attack ’ from the politician			1
according to witnesses , he argued with mr @entity15 over accusations the mp had made that he was ‘ biased ’ to the @entity45			1
mr @entity15 , a long - serving member of the @entity47 culture committee , accused the 67 - year - old presenter of subjecting him to an unprovoked verbal assault			1
the mp said he had been visiting @entity50 – where @entity29 is made – to discuss digital media and @entity54 ’s ‘ right to be forgotten ’ policy with its chief executive @entity53			0
he was then invited to take a tour of the premises , when he bumped into mr @entity13 in the middle of the busy newsroom			1
@entity12 news presenters @entity32 ( right ) and @entity13 ( left ) were involved in a row with mr @entity15 mr @entity15 said : ‘ he launched into a tirade of abuse about something i had said in a select committee about @entity29 being left - wing and biased , and that @entity13 was a prime example of it			1
‘ he said , “ just give me one example where i ’ve been biased , just one example ”			0
i replied , “ i ’m on a tour round , i have n’t come for an argument about @entity29			0
i will happily do that but i have n’t come expecting confrontation ”			0
‘ he went on , “ where are your examples ? you ca n’t give me any examples ”			0
he was like a playground bully in his own playground			0
’ yesterday , another source who was at the scene also said mr @entity13 had started the exchange			1
mr @entity15 said tuesday ’s row escalated when he suggested the presenter was getting too old for his job			1
according to one witness , he told mr @entity13 : ‘ i think it ’s time you retired ’			1
under rules set by watchdog @entity91 , @entity12 must report the news accurately and with ‘ due impartiality ’			0
however , like the @entity95 , it has been accused of giving prominence to liberal viewpoints , and its presenters have been criticised for aligning themselves too closely with the @entity45			0
this summer @entity13 came under fire after he recorded a @entity100 video - filmed in the @entity12 studios - in which he gave a personal reflection on the conflict in @entity105			2
some said he was guilty of bias against @entity108 after he focused his report exclusively on the children killed in the bombardment			0
he was also criticised for a tweet in which he said there was an ‘ awful danger ’ that the shooting down of flight @entity119 over @entity121 would ‘ provide cover for an intensification of @entity108 ’s ground war in @entity105 ’			0
in 2008 , a group of @entity124 priests accused the channel of being biased towards @entity126 and taking a ‘ trivialising attitude to @entity128 ’			2
in reply , mr @entity13 suggested the mp was struggling to hold on to his constituency of @entity131 in @entity7			1
in fact mr @entity15 beat his @entity134 rival by 9,944 votes at the last election , up from his majority of 422 votes in 2005			2
mr @entity15 said : ‘ much to the embarrassment of the @entity50 people i said , “ look @entity53 , pack it in , you ’re past it ”			2
and he said , “ well good luck with your 400 majority ”			0
‘ and i said , “ that goes to show , you ’re out of date and past it ”			0
’ it was at that point mr @entity32 entered the fray , apparently telling mr @entity15 : ‘ if you ’re going to start getting personal on @entity13 , i think you should clear off			1
’ mr @entity15 has several times accused @entity12 of bias			1
in 2010 , he said the broadcaster was so obsessed with diversity that white people were under - represented in its workforce			0
and during a select committee hearing last year he grilled chief executive @entity159 and chairman @entity160 about perceived liberal bias in its news output			0
at the time , he asked : ‘ do you think @entity13 conceals his political allegiances ? do you ? are you going to sit there with a straight face and say that ? ’ lord @entity160 conceded : ‘ i think that @entity13 would probably fall into the liberal bias category that you described , and if you were in any doubt , you could just follow his @entity171 feed on a regular basis			2
’ a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ we were pleased to welcome @entity15 mp to @entity29			2
our journalists never shy away from a full and frank discussion , and @entity13 and mr @entity15 had a robust exchange of views			1
