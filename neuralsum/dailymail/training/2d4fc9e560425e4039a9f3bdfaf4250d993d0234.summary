@entity0 are set to make an £ 8million bid for @entity3 defender @entity2 in january if they lose out to @entity4 in the chase for @entity7 international @entity6			1
@entity9 side @entity8 are holding out for £ 32million for their @entity11 - winning centre back			2
@entity13 boss @entity12 has long targeted @entity14 but the fee could be excessive for @entity0 , more so than @entity17 's side			2
@entity3 defender @entity2 could be the subject of an £ 8million bid from @entity0 in january @entity8 defender @entity6 ( left ) is also a target for @entity12 ( right ) @entity4 boss @entity17 wants to strengthen his defence with @entity6 in january @entity2 , who started his career at @entity24 , is regarded as one of the best young defenders outside the @entity27			1
he can play at both left back and centre half and could well be the player @entity12 opts for to bolster his defence in january			0
the news that @entity32 is not being rushed into signing a new deal worth in excess of £ 60,000 a week at @entity35 has alerted both @entity36 and @entity37			1
@entity35 striker @entity32 is being considered by both @entity36 and @entity37 as he ponders a new deal meanwhile , @entity39 are saying publicly they want to keep @entity40 , but an offer of £ 20m for the enigmatic striker will see the @entity39 sell			1
@entity40 's £ 85,000 - a - week wages remain a sticking point in any potential move away from @entity46			1
@entity39 midfielder @entity47 , who is on loan from @entity49 for the season , will be a target for both @entity52 and @entity36 next summer			1
@entity39 would be willing to sell @entity40 ( left ) , pictured in action against @entity54 , for £ 20million i am hearing : that one leading @entity27 club is paying parents between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 a month to lure their sons - some as young as eight years old - to join their academy rather than a rival one			1
i am also hearing : @entity62 is under consideration to succeed @entity64 as head of development and the academy at @entity0			2
former @entity0 forward @entity62 could become head of the club 's academy i bet : @entity71 are 1 - 6 on with @entity72 to win the @entity27			1
that 's about as done and dusted as you get			0
but there is value in backing the @entity77 to achieve a league and @entity80 double - @entity79 offer 11 - 2 for @entity83 's side to to the treble of @entity27 , @entity80 and @entity85 , @entity81 offer 25 - 1			0
@entity86 , pictured in action against @entity88 on saturday , has fired @entity71 to the top of the league btw : the immediate pressure on @entity92 at @entity93 was lifted on friday night when his new club beat @entity95 3 - 0 with former @entity0 striker @entity96 scoring a hat - trick			2
but there seems to be an @entity100 agenda judging by how a @entity102 film shot a mini fly - on - the - wall ' pastiche ' of @entity92 the previous week			0
the footage mocked @entity92 for not knowing the names of his players , which seemed a bit unfair			0
new @entity93 manager @entity92 gestures during his side 's 3 - 0 win against @entity95 on friday night but @entity92 appeared a fool when he pranced around the technical area and kept shouting to his players when they were on the ball , in @entity114 – @entity116 ' play , play '			0
' play , play ? ' - as opposed to what ? besides , in any language the instructions sounded more like ranting than coaching			0
i say : @entity122 has suffered another injury			0
is it a weakness in the player that he is susceptible to getting crocked so often ? or is there a deeper problem with @entity0 's ' fitness ' regime given the slightest knock seems to sideline many of their players all too frequently ? i suspect an obsession with ' sport science ' - body fat mass and all that - means that a combative player like @entity122 actually has less ' human sponge ' to project his joints and muscles than say @entity142 , who was a trojan for @entity13			2
@entity0 midfielder @entity122 has suffered another ankle injury and will be out for at least three months			0

@entity0 line up £ 8million bid for @entity3 defender @entity2
@entity149 would be back - up option if @entity6 chooses @entity4
@entity32 's contract talks being *monitored* by @entity36 and @entity37
@entity36 also targeting @entity47 along with @entity52
@entity39 could be tempted to sell @entity40 if they receive £ 20m bid
