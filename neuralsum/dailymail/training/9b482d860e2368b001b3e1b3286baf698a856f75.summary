dengue fever hits around 390 million each year causing extreme joint pain and headaches , and until now , scientists have been unable to find a drug that can cure it			1
earlier this year , researchers began testing genetically - modified mosquitoes that could eradicate entire populations of the bloodsucking bugs - and now a team of experts has found another way to stop the spread			2
they discovered that by infecting the insects with a specific bacteria , it acted in a similar way to a vaccine against the disease , which would stop it being spread to humans			1
researchers in @entity22 have freed thousands of mosquitoes infected with a dengue - blocking bacteria in the hope of combating the disease naturally scientists in @entity28 infected the mosquitoes with a bacteria called @entity31			1
the idea is that @entity31 will act as a vaccine for the mosquito which carries dengue , @entity34 , preventing it from spreading through its body			1
when a male mosquito carrying @entity31 fertilises the eggs of a female without the bacteria , these eggs do not turn into larvae			1
if both male and female mosquitoes reproducing are contaminated , their offspring will also carry @entity31			1
researchers hope this means @entity51 mosquitoes with @entity31 will spread without them having to contaminate more insects			1
@entity22 currently has the world 's highest the number of dengue cases , with 3.2 million cases and 800 deaths reported in the last five years alone			1
pictured is artwork of the @entity61 virus the initiative , by the @entity28 - based @entity63 research institute , is part of a programme also taking place in @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
starting with @entity73 , in the north of @entity28 , ten thousand mosquitoes will be released each month for four months throughout @entity22			1
@entity22 currently has the world â€™s highest the number of dengue cases , with 3.2 million cases and 800 deaths reported in the last five years alone			1
the plans follow a similar project earlier this year in which genetically modified mosquitoes were created to combat the fever			2
the mosquitoes were engineered in such a way so that their offspring died before reaching maturity			2
@entity61 is a common viral infection spread by mosquitoes			1
it is common in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world , with @entity22 having the highest number of cases			2
symptoms include : @entity61 is spread by infected mosquitoes			1
an infected human is bitten by the mosquito , the infected mosquito then bites another human and the cycle continues			2
the condition is widespread in areas with a high mosquito populations			2
@entity61 usually clears up by itself within two to three weeks			0
there are no specific medications to treat the disease but symptoms can be managed using paracetamol			0
a number of people will go on to suffer a more serious form of the illness , known as ' severe dengue '			0
it is a potentially fatal complication which can lead to shock , bleeding and organ damage			0
the latest initiative follows a similar project earlier this year in which genetically modified mosquitoes were created to combat the fever the @entity121 mosquito was created by @entity123 - based firm @entity122			1
the @entity122 insect can be used to control the dengue mosquito , @entity34 and is a strain of the wild species that contains two additional genes			0
the @entity122 males , which can not bite , are released to seek out and mate with the wild females			0
their offspring inherit the additional genes and die before becoming functional adults			0
they also inherit a marker that is visible under a special light , making monitoring in the field simple and helping ensure that dengue mosquito control programmes succeed			0
in several trials , successive releases of the @entity122 males have been shown to reduce substantially the wild population of dengue mosquitoes in the treated area			0
this meant male insects were on a suicide mission which involved mating with wild females before they , and their offspring , die			0
this , in theory , could reduce the number of wild mosquitoes which carry and spread dengue fever			2
elsewhere , @entity155 announced plans to release the @entity121 insects into its jungles to similarly help tackle the spread			2
the bugs were engineered by @entity123 - based firm @entity122			0
@entity122 has developed the technology to create the genetically modified insects which , it claims , can also be used instead of chemicals to protect food crops from pests			0
the @entity122 insect is used to control the dengue mosquito , @entity34 , because it is a strain of the wild species that contains two additional genes			0
the @entity122 males , which do n't bite , are released to seek out and mate with the wild females			0
their offspring inherit the additional genes and die before becoming functional adults			0
they also inherit a marker that is visible under a special light , making monitoring in the field simple , and helps ensure that dengue mosquito control programmes succeed			0
starting with @entity73 , in the north of @entity28 , ten thousand mosquitoes will be released each month for four months throughout @entity22			1

mosquitoes infected with @entity31 have been released in @entity183
@entity31 acts as a vaccine for the mosquito which carries dengue
if male and female mosquitoes have @entity31 , so will their offspring
this means mosquitoes with @entity31 will spread *quickly* in @entity22
it follows a similar initiative in which scientists released @entity121 mosquitoes
@entity61 can cause high *temperatures* , *muscle* pain and bleeding
