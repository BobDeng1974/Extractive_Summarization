@entity0 and @entity1 will meet in a winner - takes - all showdown on tuesday to determine which nation makes july 's @entity5 in @entity6			1
both recorded victories on saturday to maintain their perfect records and take their @entity11 qualifying group to the wire			0
@entity0 squeezed past @entity13 1 - 0 in @entity14 thanks to a first - half winner from @entity17 's @entity16 , his second decisive goal in two matches			1
@entity16 scored @entity0 's winner as they recorded a vital result over @entity13 @entity1 , meanwhile , beat @entity22 2 - 0 to lead the way on goal difference , meaning that @entity26 's @entity25 must beat them in @entity28 to take the group 's only qualifcation spot			1
as expected , @entity0 dominated possession and chances against @entity13 , but could only convert one of them			2
it came eight minutes before half - time when @entity16 collected the ball wide on the left , cut inside and curled a lovely shot into the far corner			1
confidence was high in the @entity0 camp after twice coming from behind to beat @entity22 3 - 2 on thursday and this game reverted to type almost immediately			0
faced with an @entity13 team with 11 men behind the ball , @entity0 knew they would have to be patient and their first effort came from range when @entity49 's @entity48 saw a 25 - yarder tipped over by goalkeeper @entity50			1
@entity26 's @entity0 side must now beat @entity1 on tuesday to qualify for the @entity5 @entity52 , of @entity53 , fired narrowly off target when debutant @entity55 , of @entity56 , picked him out on the edge of the penalty area			1
that pressure eventually told when right - back @entity16 marauded forward to score what would prove to be the game 's decisive goal			0
the second - half , unsurprisingly , followed a similar pattern , with @entity48 and @entity65 going close during its early stages			0
@entity13 's one and only attack of note culminated in @entity70 firing wide of the far post when well - placed			0
@entity73 midfielder @entity72 had the ball in the net three minutes from time only to be flagged offside but the one goal was sufficient as @entity0 set up their showdown with @entity1			2
@entity73 's @entity77 saw a late goal disallowed for offside @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity79 ( @entity80 ) ; @entity81 ( c ; @entity73 ) , @entity83 ( @entity82 ) , @entity84 ( @entity82 ) , @entity85 ( @entity17 ) ; @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 ) ; @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , @entity86 ( @entity73 ) ; @entity87 ( @entity88 )			0
