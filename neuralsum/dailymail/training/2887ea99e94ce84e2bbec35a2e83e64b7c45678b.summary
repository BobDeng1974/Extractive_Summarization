@entity0 is ‘ playing politics with prosperity ’ by refusing to give full backing to the planned high speed 2 railway , transport secretary @entity1 will say today			1
ministers will seek to demonstrate their commitment to the £ 50billion project this week by unveiling plans to extend it all the way to @entity12			1
but mr @entity1 will warn that the plans will face the axe unless @entity15 ’s party shows ‘ resolution ’ and backs them			1
the @entity1 will criticise @entity0 for failing its own politicians in the @entity19 and @entity20 by refusing to fully back the £ 50bn project claiming it would bring the areas economic benefits the government will present a new business case for @entity26 today in a report arguing that the new line – from @entity29 to @entity30 and on to @entity31 and @entity32 – is vital for economic growth in the @entity19			1
the report will warn that ditching @entity26 and upgrading existing lines instead could lead to 14 years of disruption on the railways			1
the study , compiled by @entity39 , warns that a ‘ very unattractive ’ package of closures , diversions and delays would be needed			0
the report – the latest attempt to persuade a sceptical public that the plans are vital for national renewal – will present a new cost - benefit analysis of the scheme			1
labour mps are expected to abstain in a @entity54 vote on thursday designed to pave the way for @entity26 amid signs that shadow chancellor @entity57 wants to withdraw the party ’s backing and spend the money on something else			2
but in a speech to launch the report , mr @entity1 will say : ‘ big projects need “ broad political consensus ” as well as “ resolution ” from political leaders			1
‘ that ’s why the new north - south railway must be a national project with broad support across parties , or in the end it will be nothing			0
’ he will warn mr @entity15 that undermining the project has already angered labour council leaders in @entity32 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity77			0
mr @entity1 will say : ‘ they know that any threat to the new line is also a threat to the future of the @entity19 and the @entity20 , to the @entity82 beyond @entity29			1
’ confronting the @entity0 leadership , he will argue : ‘ you ca n’t say one day you back better infrastructure , only the next threaten to stop it being built			2
the scheme has encountered opposition from both @entity90 and @entity0 politicians over the cost and route ‘ you ca n’t go on claiming to want one nation if you wo n’t back the things that will bring it together			2
you ca n’t play politics with our prosperity			0
’ last night @entity0 mp @entity99 said his party ’s leaders ‘ should stop playing games ’			2
he added : ‘ it was a @entity0 project , announced by a @entity0 government , and they should be supporting it			2
’ in a clear sign that the @entity109 is committed to the project , @entity107 transport minister @entity106 will on friday announce the start of a study to work out the costs and benefits of extending it to @entity12			1
under the existing plans , the @entity26 line will run from @entity29 to @entity30 , before splitting towards @entity32 and @entity31			1
@entity119 sources said extending it could mean the two lines going on to @entity122 and @entity123			0
@entity26 has been beset by claims that the £ 42billion cost of the @entity127 lines and the £ 8billion required for rolling stock could end up soaring to £ 80billion			2
mr @entity1 will say the government delivered the @entity131 rail link and the @entity132 on time and on budget			0
however , the ability of his department is called into question by mps on the @entity139 in a report on the £ 3.55billion @entity142 rail project			0
it questions the way the @entity119 tackled the @entity146 project , due for completion in 2018			0
the report says the award of a £ 1.6billion private finance contract for new trains for @entity142 was delayed by more than three years and that passengers had to wait for around 30 years for the scheme to go ahead			0
the committee concluded : ‘ we remain concerned about the department ’s skills and capacity to complete @entity142 by 2018 , alongside its ambitious wider portfolio of programmes and projects			0
’ the committee also expressed concern that a senior member of the @entity142 team was moving to the @entity26 scheme , saying the @entity119 ‘ suffers from a shortage of strong project - management skills ’ .			0

@entity1 will say @entity0 is *depriving* @entity19 of economic benefits
new plans unveiled showing how railway could extend to @entity12
report says *abandoning* @entity26 could lead to 14 years of delays elsewhere
