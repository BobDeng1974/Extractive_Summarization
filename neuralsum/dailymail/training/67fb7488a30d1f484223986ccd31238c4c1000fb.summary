by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 20:27 est , 30 january 2013 motoring groups accused the @entity2 of ‘ a whitewash ’ yesterday after the watchdog ruled out a full inquiry into petrol prices			1
the @entity2 , which launched a probe last year , claimed there was no evidence drivers were being ripped off			1
for years motorists have complained that pump prices soar when the price of crude oil rises , but fail to drop if it then falls			2
motorway service stations could be forced to advertise their prices on the hard shoulder so drivers know how much they will be charged before turning off drivers pay up to 8p a litre more at motorway services than at other forecourts , the @entity2 found but in a surprise decision , the @entity2 ruled out a full inquiry – saying there was ‘ very limited evidence ’ that prices were being kept artificially high			1
despite acknowledging ‘ widespread mistrust ’ by motorists , the @entity2 ruled ‘ competition is working well ’ in the petrol industry			1
it said price rises were mostly caused by rising crude oil costs and tax rises			0
the ruling was slammed as ‘ a whitewash ’ by critics			0
they said the decision was ‘ bitterly disappointing ’ and ‘ a missed opportunity ’ to give a fair deal to drivers by making the issue of fuel pricing more transparent			2
@entity46 spokesman @entity45 said : ‘ every motorist and business in @entity49 instinctively knows that something ’s not right			0
‘ @entity49 consumers will be bitterly disappointed			1
the nation will feel let down			0
quite frankly , i ’m shocked			0
’ @entity54 chief executive @entity53 said : ‘ we asked for transparency but all we got was a whitewash			0
the @entity2 acknowledges that high pump prices are a result of high crude prices , not competition			1
the @entity2 said sharp rises in fuel prices was cause by increases in tax and not price - fixing by oil companies ‘ so why when the barrel price drops , is that not reflected at the pump ? ’ and the @entity71 noted that since the start of the year , the cost of filling a tank has risen with petrol now costing 134.08p per litre and diesel 141.42p			1
@entity71 president @entity77 said drivers will be ‘ bitterly disappointed and frustrated ’ by the @entity2			1
he said : ‘ wholesale price surges that shot up 10p a litre and collapsed just as quickly appeared at the pump in days – but took weeks to fall away			0
’ professor @entity82 , director of the @entity83 , said many would find the @entity2 report ‘ hard to believe ’			2
pre-tax petrol prices in the @entity49 are amongst the lowest in @entity86 , the @entity2 said but he noted the @entity2 was right to identify that @entity49 motorists pay the highest fuel tax in @entity86 , at 60p in every pound			1
‘ the @entity2 does identify the true cause of drivers ’ misery – the chancellor and crude oil prices , ’ professor @entity82 said			2
‘ about 60 per cent of the pump price is accounted for by fuel duty and vat			0
’ the @entity99 ‘ condemned ’ the @entity2 ruling , which left garages having to ‘ explain the unexplainable ’ to angry motorists on their forecourts			2
@entity105 mp @entity104 , who spearheaded the @entity107 campaign against rip - off fuel prices , said the scandal still needed to be addressed			0
he insisted : ‘ whatever the @entity2 says , high prices at the pump are crushing families across @entity49			1
oil companies bear responsibility as well as the government			0
