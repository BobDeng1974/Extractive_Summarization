on a fenced - in artificial pitch , on the edge of one of @entity4 's most notorious estates , a group of men with what you could call lived - in faces are finishing a game of football			1
some are dressed in jeans and shoes - they have no kit or boots			2
stories of strife are swapped			0
' i 'm only here so i can get a shower , ' says one as he rolls a cigarette			0
' the wife booted me out a week ago and i 've been on a settee since			0
' @entity26 helped coach youngsters from @entity30 's @entity29 project another is reflecting on how this kickabout , for those who may have suffered from mental health issues , is the latest tentative step on a long journey back from the brink			1
' i was on a bridge over a motorway , ' he says as he looks into the distance			0
' they sectioned me for five years			2
' into this environment walks a man who knows all about adversity			0
@entity26 , he of hand in sleeve and knee often in cast , is back in @entity50			1
the @entity51 , now 41 , was a key cog in sir @entity54 's treble - winning machine , making 38 appearances in that memorable season following a £ 4.4m switch from @entity58			1
the midfielder ( left ) was a crucial player in @entity30 's treble winning season of 1998 - 99 but his 67 minutes in the late , late @entity63 win over @entity64 in @entity65 would be his last in a red shirt			1
three operations and two gruelling years of rehab later he was on his way to @entity70 but would continue to be haunted by injury before eventual retirement			1
he is here on sunday to coach youngsters from the @entity30 's @entity76 project , but given his background he may also be well suited to having a word with those vacating the pitch			1
@entity26 now helps his brother lecture people on how to handle setbacks using his previous experiences the years have been kind			1
@entity26 's long hair remains and is now accompanied by a beard which makes him look suited to the role he currently performs			1
' i lecture with my brother , ' he explains			2
' he 's a psychologist so he talks about how to handle setbacks and how to keep on performing			1
i can relate to that and give some real life examples from my career both good times and bad times			0
we speak to people from companies who have team building days			2
' @entity26 celebrates their semi-final win over @entity104 with @entity105 ( centre ) and @entity107 @entity26 had the world at his tricky feet when he signed for @entity30 in 1998			1
he was one of few players sir @entity54 had to try more than once to convince to move to the club , after he spurned the @entity112 's advances to sign for @entity58 and @entity113 after a frustrating year on @entity115 's bench			1
' i liked @entity116 , ' he explains , apologetically			0
' it was nothing to do with @entity50			0
i had learned the language and i had settled in			0
i enjoyed the life and i enjoyed @entity58 , but then @entity113 left			0
' @entity26 revealed that he rejected sir @entity54 the first time and signed for @entity58 in 1997 sir @entity54 came back again and managed to sign up his man to compete with @entity123 back came a determined @entity54 and this time he was successful , bringing @entity26 to the club to compete with @entity123 on the left			1
in that treble - winning year @entity26 picked up three medals , although one was almost consigned to @entity130 turf in the celebrations that followed @entity30 's belief - defying victory over @entity64 at the @entity134			1
' i do n't remember much about that night , ' he reveals			0
' it was high tension			0
i lost my medal on the pitch jumping around and i had to start looking for it			0
i was scared but i found it in the end			0
' the @entity51 ( bottom left ) started for @entity30 in the @entity63 final victory against @entity64 the @entity146 were involved in one of the most exciting comebacks of all time after winning the trophy @entity30 have a quite sensational season , winning the @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity63 then came injury			1
@entity26 went under the knife three times and it was here where he learned the lessons he now passes on			1
' you try to get your head down , ' he says			0
in a few weeks i can go on the bike , then a few more and i can go running			0
but it 's hours and hours of rehab and you feel like an outcast			2
you lose the connection with everyone , especially if it goes on for a long time			0
' eventually @entity54 called him into his office for the inevitable chat			0
@entity26 in action for @entity30 during the 1999 @entity63 final where they completed the treble ' i remember that last discussion because i felt quite guilty , ' he says			1
' i had been injured for so long and they kept paying the wages			2
he said ' do n't worry , this is football - you gave me one excellent year and we won everything '			2
' when he said that it was as though a stone fell off my heart			0
it meant a lot to me that he could feel like that			0
' of course he phoned @entity192 and helped me to get a deal with @entity70 - it spoke volumes of him			1
' @entity26 enjoyed his time at @entity197 where he was restricted to 17 appearances			2
the 41 - year - old had an injury hit time at @entity70 and only managed 17 appearances for the club ' without wanting to be disrespectful it was a smaller club , ' he says			1
' there were fewer people working there which made it feel more like a family and i enjoyed that			2
' during @entity26 's nine months on @entity211 , @entity192 was replaced by @entity212			1
' i enjoyed playing for him , ' he says			2
' he was , is , a good coach			0
that 's why i was surprised it did n't work ( at @entity30 )			1
it was always going to be really hard to take over from sir @entity54			2
sometimes it 's about getting the right job at the right moment			2
' maybe it was bad timing			0
the only thing i think he may have done wrong was to change too many of the staff			0
when you have such a winning concept its very dangerous to change too much			2
of course he wanted to put his mark on the club so you can understand it but i think it backfired			2
' @entity26 worked under @entity54 and @entity212 ( right ) and spoke highly of them both after @entity70 , @entity26 endured a short stint with @entity233 ( ' i enjoyed @entity234 but i was injured all the time ' ) before heading back to his homeland			1
he will , however , be back in the red shirt of @entity30 in when the club 's legends team recreate that 1999 final against @entity64 's veterans at @entity241 on june 14			1
' it 's always competitive with @entity30 , ' he says ( @entity26 set up @entity243 for the equaliser in the 3 - 3 first leg at a packed @entity246 )			1
' i play with lots of the old teams i have been involved with but there 's a difference with @entity30			1
' nobody wants to lose			0
they are fit and ready			0
' now , at last , so is he			0
