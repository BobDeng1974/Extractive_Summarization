the ancient @entity1 poet homer was not a single person but actually an entire culture of storytelling , a historian has claimed			2
@entity6 , an author and historian who has studied @entity0 , believes the epic poems of @entity9 and @entity10 have their origins around 2,000 bc - 1,000 years earlier than the man who wrote them is said to have lived			1
instead , he claims the stories evolved as a tradition that were shared and refined as spoken poems for hundreds of years			1
@entity17 is known about who @entity0 , seen here in an idealised marble bust from the @entity21 period , really was speaking in an interview with @entity24 , mr @entity6 , who is the @entity26 , said that the idea of @entity0 as a single author has emerged due to an ' author obsession '			1
he said : ' i think it 's a mistake to think of @entity0 as a person			2
@entity0 is an " it " - a tradition			2
@entity6 has written a book about what @entity0 can tell us about life in the modern world ' an entire culture coming up with ever more refined and ever more understanding ways of telling stories that are important to it			1
' there is very little known about exactly who or what @entity0 was , but is believed by the ancient @entity1 to have been the first great epic poet			2
some accounts claim he was a blind poet who lived between 1,102bc to @entity51			0
a guild of singing story tellers , or rhapsodes , later emerged known as the @entity55 and has led some to argue that @entity0 was actually a mythical figure whose name was derived from the guild			2
some of the earliest written works attributed to @entity0 were found with the mummified remains of @entity61 from around 150 - 200 @entity62 the oldest complete @entity9 manuscript is found in the doge 's library in @entity66 and is thought to date from @entity67			1
mr @entity6 , who lives in @entity68 , said that notes in the margins of this manuscript , which was created in the @entity71 , provide some clues to what the origin of the @entity9 may have been			1
he said : ' one of the exciting things that emerge from that is that in the early days it seems there was no such thing as a single @entity9 , no one fixed text , but this wild and variable tradition of the stories , with many different versions in different parts of the @entity87 , endlessly interacting with itself , like a braided stream in the mountains			1
' mr @entity6 said he first became interested in @entity0 around ten years ago when he began reading @entity10 while waiting for his yacht to be repaired after it was damaged in a storm while sailing up the west coast of @entity95			1
he describes reading @entity10 as being like somebody ' telling me what it was like to be alive on @entity100 '			0
@entity0 is depicted as a blind bard in this painting by @entity104 august @entity103 , held at the @entity105 in @entity106 early written accounts of @entity9 , like this 5th or 6th century codex in the @entity108 in @entity109 , are very rare and the stories are thought to have been passed down by oral storytelling for hundreds of years @entity6 , seen here during his @entity115 series on the history of @entity95 whale hunting , first read @entity10 while waiting for repairs on his yacht and believes @entity119 is a ' metaphor for all of our lives ' the ancient @entity1 legend of @entity124 and his @entity126 ' quest for the @entity127 may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the @entity130			1
the story is thought to have been in circulation even at the time of @entity0 and was thought to have been a myth			0
however , geologists have uncovered evidence that a mountainous area of @entity138 in what is now northwest @entity140 was the country ‘ rich of gold ’ described in the legend			0
they claim that villagers that were part of the wealthy @entity146 , which existed from the sixth to the first centuries @entity51 , used sheepskin to capture gold from mountain streams in the area			0
the fleece was used to line the bottom of the sandy stream beds , trapping any tiny grains of gold that built up there			0
the technique is a variation on panning used elsewhere in the world			0
this , they say , would have lead to sheepskins that were imprinted with flakes of gold and could have given rise to stories of a golden fleece			0
mr @entity6 , who has presented several tv programmes , including one about the history of whaling , has now written a book called @entity175 , or why @entity176 in the @entity177 , to explore what influence @entity0 's stories have today			1
he said that he believes many of the poems attributed to @entity0 have their beginnings around 2,000 bc. he said that large elements of the stories from @entity9 , for example , are shared with stories found in @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			1
he also said that the @entity9 also paints the @entity1 as lawless violent warriors rather than the civilised society they later became			0
he said : ' that picture of the @entity1 does n't make sense any later than about 1,800 to 1,700 bc. after that , the @entity1 had arrived in the @entity87 and started to create a civil society			0
' before that , they were essentially tribes from the steppes between the @entity130 and the @entity198 - nomadic , male - dominated , violent			0
' a picture from the 5th century @entity200 showing @entity201 sacrificing to @entity202 for @entity204 ' safe return			0

@entity6 says @entity0 was a tradition of storytelling not a single man
he believes @entity9 is 1,000 years older than dates for when @entity0 lived
he says the poems began as stories that were shared and refined orally
he began studying @entity0 ten years ago after being caught in a storm
mr @entity6 has written a book on how @entity0 should be interpreted today
