' but despite them seeing him by the fence , he 's still managed to get over without anybody going after him			1
' i was really upset when i realised he was on his own			0
i was crying and just thinking about all the things that could have happened			0
so many things were going through my head			0
' it is a seven - foot fence and has parts of the fence sticking out at the top , so he could have really hurt himself			1
