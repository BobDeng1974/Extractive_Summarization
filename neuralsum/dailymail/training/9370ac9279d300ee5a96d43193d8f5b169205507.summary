the @entity2 private charged with sending @entity4 secrets to the website @entity5 had a history of suicidal thoughts and aloof behavior that outweighed a psychiatrist 's opinion that he posed no risk to himself , two former counselors testified sunday			1
@entity2 staff sergeant @entity13 and @entity15 master sergeant @entity14 testified on the sixth day of a pre-trial hearing for private first class @entity17 at @entity19 , near @entity20 , @entity21			1
the hearing is to determine whether @entity17 's nine months in pre-trial confinement at the @entity15 brig in @entity25 , @entity26 , were so punishing that the judge should dismiss all charges			2
his turn on the stand : @entity17 seen arriving at a courthouse at military base @entity19 , @entity21 before testifying about the treatment he received during his two - years in prison accused : @entity17 , 24 , is blamed for the largest leak of state secrets in @entity4 history the 24 - year - old intelligence analyst is accused of sending hundreds of thousands of classified documents to the secret - spilling website in 2009 and 2010			1
military judge colonel @entity41 recessed the hearing until wednesday			0
it 's scheduled to run through december 12			0
the counselors , both of whom worked in the brig , sat on a board that recommended to the brig commander that @entity17 remain in maximum custody and on either injury - prevention or suicide - risk status -- conditions that kept him confined to his cell 23 hours a day , sometimes with no clothing			1
@entity13 said under cross-examination by defense attorney @entity57 that besides the mental - health report , he considered evidence that @entity17 had contemplated suicide after his arrest in @entity62 in may 2010			2
the evidence included a noose @entity17 had fashioned from a bedsheet while confined in @entity66 , and a written statement he made upon arrival at @entity25 in july 2010 that he was ' always planning and never acting ' on suicidal impulses			1
in cuffs : @entity5 suspect @entity17 , centre , is escorted from his hearing in @entity19 , @entity21 @entity13 acknowledged @entity17 had been a polite , courteous and nearly trouble - free detainee at @entity25			1
‘ would n't his past six months of performance be an indicator of his potential for future behavior ? ’ @entity57 asked			0
but @entity13 maintained that @entity17 's unwillingness to converse with him and other brig staff was a warning sign he was at risk of self - harm			2
@entity13 said he considered the opinion of the brig psychiatrist , navy capt. @entity85 , that @entity17 was no longer at risk of self - harm			2
but @entity13 said the weight he gave to @entity85 's views was tempered by the fact that another detainee had recently killed himself after his custody status was reduced on @entity85 's advice			0
' i would consider it , but i would always consider it with care , sir , ' he told @entity57			0
@entity14 , who spent more time with @entity17 , said @entity17 chose not to speak most of the time except for short , yes - or - no answers			2
he said @entity17 spurned his offers to play chess or work brain teasers by arrogantly responding , ' they 're a little below my level			0
' ‘ i 've got a person not communicating with me that 's sitting in his cell , not doing anything , ’ @entity14 said			0
he said he supported the brig commander 's decision in march 2011 to strip @entity17 of all clothing at night and place him on suicide watch after @entity17 told another staffer that if he really wanted to kill himself , he could use the elastic waistband on his underwear			0
‘ if someone tells me they 're going to shoot themselves in the face , i 'm not going to give them a gun , ’ @entity14 said			0
turning the guns : the young soldier 's lawyer immediately turned fire against the investigating officer - claiming the proceedings were biased against @entity17 defence : in this courtroom sketch , @entity17 , second from left , sits as his attorney , @entity57 , demands that the investigating officer , lt colonel @entity129 , recuse himself from the case later sunday , the defense showed an approximately 12 - minute video clip of @entity14 talking with @entity17 through the bars of his cell about the detainee 's frustration with his situation in january 2011			1
‘ every day that passes by i 'm getting increasingly frustrated , ’ @entity17 told him			0
@entity17 was moved in april 2011 to pre-trial confinement at @entity141 , @entity142 he 's been held there in medium custody since then			0
earlier sunday , the military judge said @entity17 's trial , previously set to begin february 4 , would be pushed back to sometime in march due to lengthy pre-trial proceedings			1
