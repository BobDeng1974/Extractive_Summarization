by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 1 march 2013 @entity2 chief executive @entity1 was handed a £ 1.49million bonus taxpayers are in line to lose £ 12.4billion on their emergency bailouts of @entity2 and @entity9 , it emerged last night			1
the hidden costs , incurred because @entity11 paid too much for shares in the banks in 2008 , were written off and buried in budget documents in 2010			1
but they were unearthed yesterday by @entity17 officials as @entity2 indicated it is likely to start offloading the taxpayer ’s 39 per cent stake when the bank ’s share price , currently 53p , hits 61p			1
the 61p target is viewed as the ‘ break even ’ point at which @entity2 shares can be sold without incurring further loss			1
the ‘ break - even ’ figure for @entity9 is around 400p			0
however , @entity30 ’s government pumped in £ 66billion of public money to bail out the two banks and paid over the market value for them to the tune of £ 12.4billion			1
this secret write - off came in 2010 a few weeks before the @entity37 came to power			0
the write - off emerged as a fresh £ 1.5billion charge for mis - selling payment protection insurance prompted @entity2 to post its fifth straight year of huge losses			2
the bank also came under fire for dishing out a £ 1.49million bonus to chief executive @entity1			0
@entity2 chairman sir @entity47 insisted it was showing ‘ restraint ’ , an echo of @entity51 ’s defence of @entity9 on wednesday when that bank announced losses of £ 5billion – and £ 600million of bonuses for staff			1
mr @entity1 said he was ‘ confident ’ the state - backed lender could be sold back to the private sector at a profit			0
the £ 12.4billion write - off covers the £ 3.6billion on @entity2 and £ 8.8billion on @entity9 incurred in the initial bailout			2
this means taxpayers will in reality break even only if shares in the two banks are sold at the inflated price at which they were bought by @entity30			1
@entity70 , of the @entity71 ’ @entity69 , said : ‘ it seems increasingly doubtful taxpayers will get back the billions they pumped into these failing institutions			0
’ losses at @entity2 , which received a £ 20billion bailout in 2008 , narrowed to £ 570million last year , down from £ 3.5billion in 2011			2
but despite the bank remaining in the red for a fifth year it awarded the bonus in deferred shares to mr @entity1			2
he will only receive the award if the share price hits 73.6p for a sustained period or the @entity83 had sold at least a third of its stake for the lower price of 61p			0
@entity2 also paid out £ 365million in bonuses , a 3 per cent drop from last year			1
sir @entity47 said the bank ‘ continues to show restraint ’ but that ‘ employees should be rewarded for their contribution to the further strengthening of the business in 2012 ’			0
@entity11 ’s @entity96 , of the @entity97 , said : ‘ this is an amazing waste of taxpayers ’ money and sends the message we reward failure			0
it ’s the same story – when will we ever learn			0
’ insiders insisted the @entity17 had never set a target price at which it would start selling shares in @entity2 and @entity9 .			2

once @entity2 shares hit 61p the bank could sell taxpayers ' 39 per cent stake
@entity30 *'s* government paid above market value for shares in 2010
