despite being crippled in space , @entity0 has managed to discover a star that hosts three @entity4 - sized planets			1
the outermost planet orbits in the ' @entity6 - a region where surface temperatures could be moderate enough for liquid water and perhaps life to exist			1
at a distance of 150 light years , the star ranks among the top 10 nearest stars known to have transiting planets			1
despite being hobbled in space , @entity0 has managed to discover a star that hosts three planets only slightly larger than @entity4 the star , @entity23 201367065 , is a cool red m - dwarf about half the size and mass of our own sun. its distance means it 's bright enough for astronomers to study the planets ' atmospheres to determine whether they are like @entity4 's atmosphere and possibly conducive to life			1
' a thin atmosphere made of nitrogen and oxygen has allowed life to thrive on @entity4 , ' said @entity39 , the @entity40 astronomer who led the study			1
' but nature is full of surprises			0
many exoplanets discovered by the @entity0 mission are enveloped by thick , hydrogen - rich atmospheres that are probably incompatible with life as we know it			2
' this cartoon shows the three newly discovered extrasolar planets ( right ) casting shadows on their host star that can been seen as eclipses , or transits , at @entity4 ( left )			2
@entity4 can be detected by the same effect , but only in the plane of @entity4 's orbit ( the ecliptic ) in their hunt for alien life , astronomers have so far focused on looking for @entity4 - like planets around smaller , cooler suns			1
but these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star			1
now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars , and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day - night cycle similar to @entity4 – increasing the chance of finding alien life			2
' planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to @entity4 's than previously expected , ' said @entity83 , a postdoctoral fellow at the @entity84			2
' if we are correct , there is no permanent , cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet , ' he said			0
though astronomers are still awaiting concrete evidence , theoretical arguments suggest that many exoplanets should be able to maintain an atmosphere as massive that of @entity4			0
while their models show that they would have a day - night cycle making them more similar to @entity4 , the duration of their days could last between a few weeks and few months			2
the three planets are 2.1 , 1.7 and 1.5 times the size of @entity4			2
the outermost planet , at 1.5 @entity4 radii , is the smallest of the group and orbits far enough from its host star that it receives levels of light from its star similar to those received by @entity4 from the sun. ' most planets we have found to date are scorched			1
this system is the closest star with lukewarm transiting planets , ' @entity120 a @entity119 graduate student who made the discovery			0
' there is a very real possibility that the outermost planet is rocky like @entity4 , which means this planet could have the right temperature to support liquid water oceans			1
' @entity128 astronomer @entity127 said that extrasolar planets are discovered by the hundreds these days , though many astronomers are left wondering if any of the newfound worlds are really like @entity4			0
the newly discovered planetary system will help resolve this question , he said			0
' we 've learned in the past year that planets the size and temperature of @entity4 are common in our @entity139 galaxy , ' professor @entity127 said			2
' we also discovered some @entity4 - size planets that appear to be made of the same materials as our @entity4 , mostly rock and iron			1
' the next step will be observations with other telescopes , including the @entity147 , to take the fingerprint of the molecules in the planetary atmospheres			1
if these warm , nearly @entity4 - size planets have puffy , hydrogen - rich atmospheres , @entity147 will see the tell - tale signal			1
the @entity154 is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet the discovery is all the more remarkable , the researchers said said , because the @entity0 telescope lost two reaction wheels that kept it pointing at a fixed spot in space			0
@entity0 was reborn in 2014 as ' @entity168 ' with a clever strategy of pointing the telescope in the plane of @entity4 's orbit , the ecliptic , to stabilise the spacecraft			0
@entity0 is now back to mining the cosmos for planets by searching for eclipses or ' transits , ' as planets pass in front of their host stars and periodically block some of the starlight			0
' this discovery proves that @entity168 , despite being somewhat compromised , can still find exciting and scientifically compelling planets , ' said professor @entity120			0
@entity0 sees only a small fraction of the planetary systems in its gaze : those with orbital planes aligned edge - on to our view from @entity4			0
planets with large orbital tilts are missed			0
a census of @entity0 planets that the team conducted in 2013 corrected statistically for these random orbital orientations , and concluded that one in five sun - like stars in the @entity139 have @entity4 - size planets in the habitable zone			1
accounting for other types of stars as well , there may be 40 billion such planets galaxy - wide			0

@entity23 201367065 is a red dwarf about half the size of our own sun
it hosts three @entity4 - sized planets located around 150 light years away
the outermost planet orbits in the ' @entity6 - a region where surface temperatures could be moderate for water and life to exist
the next step will be observations with other telescopes , including the @entity147 , to determine if they have atmospheres where life can thrive
