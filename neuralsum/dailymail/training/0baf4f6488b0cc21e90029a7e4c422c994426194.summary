by @entity0 published : 16:16 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 04:49 est , 9 january 2014 television producers must be scrying into crystal balls , or getting bulletins from next week via @entity6 telegrams , because the tv schedules have been uncannily prescient lately			1
first there was a major drama about the @entity10 that began screening on the day that @entity11 died			1
then @entity13 ’s new food show was boosted by the most notorious trial for years			1
and last night , as @entity16 was mopping up after appalling storms , @entity15 was threatened by floods and the villagers were taking sanctuary in the parish church			1
the river was bursting its banks and , this being @entity25 , it was raining bodies			1
@entity28 version of the @entity29 : @entity30 , right , as dci @entity31 in the country cop drama @entity25 ( @entity35 ) is a psychopathic version of @entity29			1
it ’s a world of bicycling maiden aunts and farmers with twine knotted round their trouser legs , bucolic and quaint and steeped in blood			1
because the show is timeless , it seemed odd to have it topical			1
villagers were filling sandbags and panic - buying tins of beans in the village shop ; as the downpour intensified , they scurried to the church for life - preserving mugs of chicken soup , and hymns led by a retired vicar			1
he was a serial killer , of course , but he preached a lively sermon and joined the congregation in a rousing chorus of @entity62			1
mass murderer or not , the old - fashioned @entity64 clergyman is always a reassuring figure			1
@entity67 , who long ago played @entity69 ’s loyal junior in the classic spy serial @entity70 , was the vengeful vicar			2
his successor was @entity72 , who has a grand repertoire of heavy stares and sour scowls ; she is the @entity76 in @entity77 , of course , but she ought to be starring in her own crime series			2
front can inject an overdose of saccharine into the nastiest lines , which masks the aggression in her characters			2
surveying a medieval fresco in the crypt of her church , she remarked : ‘ is n’t it beautiful ? all that misery and suffering , almost makes me tingle			2
’ that sweetly voiced cruelty would make her formidable in the police interview room			2
as a female @entity95 , she could be terrific			2
@entity30 has been @entity25 ’s chief detective since 2010 ; he might want to investigate just where the series is set			1
the locals come from all over the place — the shopkeeper ’s son and the ex-vicar ’s daughter had strong hints of the @entity105 in their accents , but the farmer ’s drunken son who lived only a mile away sounded more @entity109 than a @entity111 pony			0
@entity116 , the political drama starring @entity113 as a satanic @entity115 senator , returns next month for a second series , but again it will be available only via streaming internet service @entity119			0
‘ democracy is so over-rated , ’ purrs @entity113			0
it ’s wonderful viewing , but is it television ? even more @entity125 , the men of the @entity127 were chanting the shipping forecast like a liturgy in their rich @entity131 voices , on another timely programme about the weather , @entity134 and @entity135 ( @entity136 )			0
this documentary , part of the excellent @entity140 series , charted the evolution of the weather forecast , from its invention by @entity145 scientist @entity144 — who got it wrong so often that he eventually felt compelled to kill himself , by way of apology			0
the @entity136 introduced forecasts in the mid-fifties , after a bout of extreme weather left 34 dead in the @entity154 village of @entity155			0
amid the debris , one resident calmly described to the cameras with an almost poetic clarity how he had seen floodwater wash away houses that ‘ folded like a pack of cards ’ and ‘ the agonising screams of some of the local inhabitants , whom i knew very well ’			0
the first tv forecaster was castigated by the @entity169 for his amiable delivery : @entity171 drew his own weather maps , and liked to advise viewers when to hang out their washing or take a brolly to work			0
at least he did n’t do it like @entity178 , who was required to read the forecast at the end of @entity181 , as an experiment in 2005			0
@entity183 thought such mundanities beneath his considerable dignity , and his voice dripped with contempt as he announced : ‘ in the afternoon there will be rain , except in places where there is n’t			0
’ imagine @entity192 as @entity193 , reading the poem in a @entity196 ’s greeting card , and you ’ll have half of the sarcastic fury @entity178 mustered for tomorrow ’s temperatures			0
let ’s hope we never hear him recite the shipping forecast .			0
