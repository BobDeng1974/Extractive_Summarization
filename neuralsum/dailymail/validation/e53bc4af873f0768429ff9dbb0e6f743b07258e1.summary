@entity0 , the 2014 @entity1 winner , has been confirmed as a ‘ definite ’ starter in the @entity4 ’s @entity3 at @entity5 on saturday week			1
trainer @entity6 has made no public comment since the nine - year - old was pulled up behind @entity9 last month when trying to defend his title			1
since that run jockey @entity11 has lost the ride on @entity0 , although a broken arm 24 hours after that news emerged means @entity11 would not have been available anyway			2
the 2014 @entity1 winner @entity0 has been confirmed as a definite @entity3 starter @entity6 will also be represented by @entity17 , who also won at last season ’ s @entity20 , as his launches a twin assault on the £ 1million prize			1
a spokeswoman for @entity27 ’s @entity26 stable said : ‘ both horses are definite runners			0
there are no concrete jockey plans at the moment			2
’ victory for either gelding , both of which run in the colours of dr @entity38 , would make @entity27 , who won the 2002 race as a jockey on board @entity42 , only the sixth man to both ride and train a @entity3 winner			1
trainer @entity6 has made no comment since the nine - year - old was pulled up behind @entity9 last month best known as the rider of three - time @entity1 winner @entity50 , @entity6 would also join @entity52 as the only man to have ridden and trained the winner of both the @entity3 and @entity1			1
jockey options for the @entity27 pair could include @entity57 , who won the 2014 @entity58 on @entity59 , who has been kept fresh for his national challenge			0
@entity17 is a 20 - 1 shot for the @entity5 race but confirmation that @entity0 , due to carry top weight of 11st 10lb , will run could prompt the few bookmakers making his a 50 - 1 shot to trim his odds back in line with rivals			1
trainer @entity6 's second representative @entity17 is a 20 - 1 shot for the @entity3 at @entity5 definitely out of the @entity3 is @entity72 ’s @entity71 , who has a breathing problem while @entity75 ’s @entity74 is rated ‘ very doubtful ’ after picking up a leg injury			1
merry @entity71 ’s exit frees up jockey @entity78 , who looks a riding option for @entity81 ’s @entity80			0
@entity82 has confirmed @entity83 , the 2013 @entity84 winner , run despite the gelding being beaten almost 70 lengths on his latest run over hurdles at @entity89			2
@entity71 said : ‘ i do n’t know what happened at @entity89			0
it just did not happen for him but he is in good form and @entity93 rides			0
’ @entity94 rides @entity95 for @entity96 in the @entity97 at @entity98 on wednesday night as trainer ’s son @entity99 , who had said he expected to be in action at the meeting , is again missing			0
the move is further evidence of @entity94 ’s increased role with @entity96 for the flat season			0
