as our future queen , many would forgive @entity2 for treating herself to a new designer outfit every time she had to make a public appearance			0
but the @entity6 is far cleverer than that			0
she has no desire to be seen as a mere clothes horse - and frequently recycles outfits she has worn at previous high profile events to show the public that she is not frittering the public purse away on endless designer clothes			1
yes , she spends a certain amount on clothes from top designers - but she 'll wear the items again and again - just as the @entity0 does , or notoriously thrifty @entity20 , who regularly brings out a dress she first wore 40 years ago			1
and for yesterday 's @entity23 appearance , @entity2 did just that			1
she chose a £ 1,100 cable knit @entity27 dress she had worn a year ago to the day , during the @entity29 tour she and @entity30 embarked upon last summer			1
2012 @entity2 wore the cream knit @entity27 dress for her appearance in the royal box 2011 @entity35 first wore the dress exactly a year ago to the day - with the same @entity38 shoes it was their first official @entity40 tour as husband and wife , and @entity2 's wardrobe was under the microscope			1
she wore the dress on the fourth of july 2011 , for a visit to @entity50 's @entity49			1
it caused a stir among fashion cognoscenti at the time , given that it was a six - year - old dress - ancient in fashion terms - from the 2006 collection by @entity27 , the same fashion house behind her wedding dress			1
not only was it 12 seasons old , but it had been worn by another high profile star , @entity62 , who was photographed in the navy version in the year of its release			1
but @entity2 , who teamed the dress with the same £ 165 blue suede @entity38 pumps she had on yesterday , wore it with panache			1
the dress was just one of a series of impeccable choices on that trip - and one of the few items from that time we have seen again since			1
the tour was seen a great success , and it sealed the status of the new couple as the thoroughly modern , entirely likeable , popular new face of the monarchy - so it is no wonder that @entity2 has a fondness for this dress			1
the £ 1,1000 @entity27 cable knit dress comes from the @entity92 design house 's 2006 collection - when the late founder @entity27 was still at the helm			1
@entity62 wore the style the year it was shown on the catwalk , while @entity2 caused a stir in the fashion world when she wore it a full six years afterwards			1
it was exactly a year ago yesterday that she wore the @entity27 garment - on a visit to @entity49 last year during the tour of @entity50 she embarked upon with @entity30 just a few months after the @entity103			1
a familiar style : @entity2 wore the dress exactly a year ago today - with the same navy suede @entity38 pumps she is wearing today - while actress @entity62 wore a navy version of the dress in 2006 tennis ace : @entity2 wore a cream knit @entity27 dress for her appearance in the royal box			1
it was a dress she has worn before - but this time the style was well - pitched for the sporting event in the event , it was the perfect choice for a day at the tennis too			1
always impeccably turned out , @entity2 has an undeniable flair for fashion and frequently dresses as the occasion demands , whether it be top - to - toe red for @entity50 day , or a green coat for @entity126			1
so it is no surprise that she seemed to have referenced 1920s tennis style with her outfit choice			0
arriving with @entity30 just in time to watch @entity131 take @entity132 in straight sets on @entity134 , followed by @entity136 's tense victory , looked as though she 'd shopped from a @entity23 kit list from the roaring twenties			1
after @entity131 dispatched with his @entity141 rival in straight sets , the royals were in for a far more stressful experience as @entity92 hope @entity136 took on @entity146 's @entity145			1
inevitably the @entity147 lost the first set but turned it around to win the next three and march in to the semi-finals where he will face @entity151			0
@entity136 mania : @entity2 looked worried today as @entity146 's @entity145 held his serve to take the first game 40 - 0 tense : the strain of the @entity136 match soon got too much for @entity2 , and she gasped as the two battled it out ont he court feeling the pressure : as @entity136 struggled to gain a lead on his opponent , @entity2 looked increasingly strained still grim - faced , she applauds as @entity136 , who lost five points in quick succession in the first set , takes a point back from his rival she accessorised the designer dress with a pair of £ 165 navy blue suede court shoes from @entity38			1
it was a dress she has worn before - exactly a year ago today - when she made a trip to @entity49 during her tour of @entity50 in 2011			1
it is the first @entity23 appearance of the year for the @entity174 and @entity6			2
the royal pair 's visit comes after @entity177 and @entity178 were guests in the royal box yesterday , and @entity181 and @entity182 sat alongside @entity183 and her son @entity184 in the prestigious seats last friday			2
good company : the duchess sat in the row in front of @entity190 and @entity191 , parents of former @entity92 tennis player @entity193 game on : just like the @entity182 , @entity2 and @entity30 are keen tennis fans and attended the tournament last year too - when @entity2 took part in a @entity199 wave the @entity200 and @entity201 visited last week , meeting @entity202 and @entity193			2
it was @entity205 's first visit to the championship since 1970			2
today , the @entity174 and @entity6 sat on the front row of the @entity208 next to @entity209 , chairman of the @entity211 , and @entity2 next to his wife , @entity212			0
they watched intently as @entity131 took on @entity132 , occasionally whispering to each other , and making conversation with @entity215 and mrs brook			0
the match was delayed after just 24 minutes as drizzle hit @entity219 , and then again in the fourth set around 7pm with @entity136 leading two sets to one			0
also on the front row of the @entity208 today were tennis couple @entity223 and @entity224			0
other guests were television sports presenter @entity226 with his partner , @entity227 , with veteran broadcaster sir @entity228 and wife @entity229			0
royal guests : the pair arrived at lunchtime to watch @entity233 take on @entity141 player @entity132 on @entity134 @entity234 dressed : the knitted outfit was a wise choice given the chill in the air today @entity240 manager @entity239 , recently returned from the @entity242 tournament , and his wife @entity243 were also in the box			0
after his match , @entity131 revealed he had met @entity30 and @entity2			0
' i met @entity2 for the first time			0
@entity30 i 've met before after @entity248 , ' he said			0
' they were very nice , very friendly			0
i was very happy to meet them			0
' @entity251 coming out , i think it 's inspiring			2
it 's great for the event			2
it 's great for @entity23			2
it 's great for the club			2
it 's great for the players			2
' it 's nice to see that the @entity208 is always full , as well			2
it 's never empty for us			2
and if it is , you know they 're going to come back shortly			0
' they 're not here just to drink champagne and tea in the back			0
they really do come for the tennis			0
' we feel that on @entity134 , and i do feel that			0
that 's probably one of the reasons why i play well on @entity134			2
' that 's entertainment : the young looked to be enjoying the game between @entity131 and @entity132 today best seats in the house : the two sat in the same seats as @entity2 's mother @entity177 sat in yesterday , and @entity181 and @entity182 last week thrilling : the @entity6 chews her lip with nerves and a close call causes a sharp intake of breath close game : @entity2 reacts as she watches a particularly tense moment in the match and smiles broadly a little later enjoying the match : @entity131 commented after his game how much the presence of the @entity251 lifts the atmosphere on @entity134 good times : the royal two appeared to be having a great day in @entity219 greetings : @entity30 chats to @entity224 , just one among a number of former tennis pros in the royal box today the two greeted one another warmly before enjoying the match champs : tennis sweethearts @entity223 and @entity311 enjoy the warm up memory lane : @entity313 and his wife are used to being on the other side of the royal box @entity2 's style inspiration ? vintage : did @entity2 take style tips from tennis stars of yesteryear including @entity323 player @entity322 , in action at @entity23 in 1924 snap ! twenties tennis players wore the same pleats as @entity2 's , and their jumpers tied at the neck reflect @entity2 's neck tie today the @entity174 and @entity6 may have made the most high profile appearance of the day , but this was by far a day off for the rest of the senior @entity251			1
lately it seems as though not a day goes by without an engagement for the @entity0 , who at 86 seems to be working harder than ever before			0
the @entity0 and prince @entity209 were in @entity335 where they attended a @entity338 service as part of the ongoing @entity341 celebrations			0
smiling despite the rain : the @entity0 leaves @entity338 with @entity344 dr @entity343 after attending a service of thanksgiving to mark her @entity341 the queen was accompanied by the @entity174 in @entity338 this afternoon the two enjoyed a performance from the @entity350 - including among their number former @entity352 singer , @entity351			0
as for @entity355 and @entity205 , the two are currently enjoying a four day tour of @entity357 and the @entity358 to celebrate @entity205 ' 60 years as @entity359			1
the two made an appearance in @entity362 today where they paid a visit to the local @entity365 facilities			0
the @entity366 were on hand to provide refreshments - which @entity355 enjoyed with great gusto			0
paying tribute : the @entity201 today paid a visit to the @entity373 centre as part of a tour celebrating 60 years of prince @entity205 holding the title of @entity174 of @entity357 time for tea : the duchess has cake with the the local @entity366 on her visit to the @entity365 facilities			1
