first came the internet spoofs , followed by a @entity2 card featuring @entity3 and @entity4			1
now supermarket @entity5 have become the latest to produce a version of @entity8 's infamous ' break the @entity9 ' shoot - and are using it to sell £ 10 champagne			1
the supermarket has recreated photographer @entity13 ’s image using a @entity8 lookalike who poses with a champagne coupe resting on her bottom , a spray of drink arching over her head and into the glass			1
@entity5 's new @entity8 spoof is the latest in a series , all of which have flooded the internet since @entity8 's paper magazine cover was revealed last week			1
@entity8 has been transformed into a centaur , a @entity45 character and has even had googly eyes superimposed onto her bottom			1
other memes have compared @entity8 ’s shapely derriere to anything from a glazed crispy crème donut , to a pair of peaches and perhaps , least flatteringly , a potato			2
but the photographs - one of which shows @entity8 standing front on completely naked - have not received an entirely positive reaction			2
indeed , such was the furore that @entity60 magazine editor , @entity59 , was forced to come to @entity8 's defense over the weekend			1
he denied claims that her bottom in particular had been digitally enhanced and insisted that every part of it was the real deal			0
' the body is @entity8 ’s body , ’ he said			2
‘ yes the image is retouched as all photos on the covers of magazines are retouched			0
' if you know @entity77 ’s work , you know he creates magic like the splash of the champagne over the head with pasting images together			0
as for the butt we did n’t pad it or make it bigger			0
’ amusing : @entity8 was turned into a @entity45 character by @entity90 @entity8 happily posed for photographer @entity92 , however , the photographs have become the subject of many memes , spoofs and parodies @entity8 has also spoken out about the images , saying ' i 'm never one to preach , but i felt really positive and really good about myself			2
' i like the photos , i did it for me , i hope other people like them			0
' she also revealed that the champagne glass pose was n't as easy as it looked			0
' my back hurt for about a week after that shoot ... [ photographer @entity107 ] has an art of posing you and it was definitely not comfortable			0

@entity5 has recreated @entity13 's photograph using a model
she copies @entity8 's pose , *balancing* a champagne coupe on her bottom
