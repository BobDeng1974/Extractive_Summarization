for @entity3 - bound optical telescopes , the surface of @entity1 is shrouded beneath thick clouds made mostly of carbon dioxide			1
to penetrate this veil , probes like the @entity8 spacecraft use radar to reveal remarkable features of the planet , such as mountains , craters , and volcanoes			0
but now , astronomers have combined the @entity17 with the radar transmitter at the @entity19 to make remarkably detailed images of the planet 's surface from @entity3			1
pictured is a projection of the radar data of @entity1 collected in 2012			2
striking surface features , like mountains and ridges , are easily seen			0
the black diagonal band at the center represents areas too close to the equator to obtain well - resolved image data the radar signals from @entity19 in @entity35 passed through both @entity3 's atmosphere and the atmosphere of @entity1			1
here they hit the surface and bounced back to be received by the @entity17 in @entity40 in a process known as bistatic radar			1
this capability is essential to study not only the surface as it appears now , but also to monitor it for changes			0
by comparing images taken at different periods in time , scientists hope to eventually detect signs of active volcanism			1
they believe images such as this could also reveal other dynamic geologic processes that could provide clues to @entity1 's geologic history and subsurface conditions			2
@entity58 astronomers have revealed a new theory for a ' y ' shape on @entity1 ( annotated image from the @entity62 in 1979 shown )			1
they say it is formed by winds pushing a ' wave ' of clouds on the planet			1
these winds move faster at higher altitudes , creating the odd shape ' it is painstaking to compare radar images to search for evidence of change , ' said @entity75 , a senior scientist at the @entity77 's @entity76 in @entity78 , ' the work is ongoing			1
in the meantime , combining images from this and an earlier observing period is yielding a wealth of insight about other processes that alter the surface of @entity1			2
' @entity1 is slightly smaller than @entity3 but has a similar mass. it is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles ( 108 million kilometres ) , and takes about 225 days to orbit the sun. one day on @entity1 lasts as long as 243 @entity3 days			0
its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen , with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets			0
it 's believed that its atmosphere contributed to a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet inhospitable			0
the planet 's extreme high temperatures of almost 480 ° @entity106 ) make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it			0
high - resolution radar images of @entity1 were first obtained by @entity19 in 1988 and most recently by @entity19 and @entity17 in 2012			1
when astronomers first started taking images of @entity1 , they were somewhat baffled by a mysterious ' y ' shape that covered the entire planet			1
last week researchers say they have an answer - high intensity winds are distorting a ' wave ' of clouds to produce a stretched effect			2
the discovery could also reveal how similar processes take place on other slow - rotating bodies in the solar system			0
the latest theory was proposed by astronomers from the @entity129 of @entity130 ( @entity131 ) in @entity132 , @entity58 , in collaboration with the university of the @entity135 and the @entity136 of @entity137			0
on @entity1 strong winds move the upper atmosphere 225 mph ( 360km/h ) , circling the planet every four to five @entity3 days			2
but the planet itself takes almost 243 @entity3 days to complete an orbit - meaning the winds are much faster than the rotation speed of the planet			0
the winds have a mostly constant speed at different latitude , but nearer the pole they circle the planet quicker as the circumference of the planet is smaller			0
this ultimately gives rise to this ' y ' shape , as the clouds at the top and bottom of the shape are moved more quickly			0
to take the stunning images , astronomers combined the @entity17 ( right ) in @entity40 with the radar transmitter at the @entity19 ( left ) in @entity35			1

astronomers took images with @entity17 in @entity40
they combined this with the radar transmitter at the @entity19
by comparing images , scientists hope to detect signs of active volcanism
