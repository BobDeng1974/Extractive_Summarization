residents of a @entity2 neighborhood spooked by recent sightings of an unidentified creature can rest easy			1
locals in the @entity7 area of the @entity8 have been seeing the creature scurrying about the area for months , generally by night but sometimes in broad daylight			2
some thought it was a skunk , others a raccoon , but now it 's finally been identified : the unusual - looking animal is a fisher , sometimes called a fisher - cat , and it could be the answer the @entity2 's rat problem			1
their stature is relatively low to the ground , with short legs , small ears and a well - furred tail			0
' ' one night , i was out putting out garbage and i saw it running across , and i was like , " wow what is that ? " ' @entity37 told @entity38			0
the first sighting was in april when @entity41 officer @entity40 managed to take a picture of the animal			0
after that , others documented its meanderings around the area , but no one knew what it was until now			0
zoologist @entity52 identified it as a fisher after being sent a picture of the creature			1
the fisher is a member of the weasel family that once lived in the @entity2 area in abundance until the fur trade pushed them north and into the @entity65			1
@entity52 , of the @entity66 , tells @entity38 that the creature may have come down the river			2
no natural predators : fishers are hunters that prey on small rodents - but are n't a threat to humans rat catcher : zoologists say it is a fisher , a rat - eating member of the weasel family that was driven from the @entity80 in the 1600s after it was over-hunted for its fur re-establishing : it 's unclear if the fisher is making a comeback or if the @entity8 creature is the only one of its kind ' i 'm guessing maybe he came down the river , kind of connecting up some of the natural areas , and then kind of took this side trip off into the @entity8			1
they 're very good at sneaking around , ' he told @entity38			0
turns out the fisher preys on rats and squirrels			0
it 's not a threat to humans but could be to cats and small dogs			1
they can climb trees and have even been known to prey on deer			0
@entity106 trapping was banned in the 1930s			0
@entity52 says today the fisher population is booming in the @entity109 and a trapping season has been reinstated			2
@entity52 said the last sighting of a fisher in the @entity2 area was probably in the 1600s			1
if the @entity8 fisher is a sign of the species re-establishing itself in the city , it will face a host of challenges , such as avoiding being hit by cars			1
' we ’ve never seen them survive in anything as developed as the @entity8 , so we do n’t know , ' @entity52 told @entity126			2
' can they really set up a population ? '			0

*people* in the @entity8 first *spotted* the odd creature in april
a zoologist has identified it as a fisher , a member of the weasel family
fishers prey on rats and squirrels
they were once *prevalent* in the @entity2 area but moved further *upstate* after they were excessively hunted for their fur
the last one was seen sometime in the 1600s
zoologist @entity52 thinks the @entity8 fisher may have come down the river
@entity106 could help control the rat population - but may also have a taste for cats and small dogs
