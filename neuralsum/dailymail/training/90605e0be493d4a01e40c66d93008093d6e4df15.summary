ancient @entity0 were mummifying their dead 1,500 years earlier than previously thought			2
traces of complex embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies that were placed in tombs in one of the earliest recorded ancient @entity8 cemeteries			1
the formula used to treat the cloth predates the earliest scientific evidence of embalming in the area of northern @entity14 by more than a millennium			1
traces of complex embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies that were placed in tombs in one of the earliest recorded ancient @entity8 cemeteries , showing the the ancient @entity0 mummified their dead 1,500 years earlier than thought			1
grave 408 in the cemetery at @entity21 is pictured experts identified a pine resin , an aromatic plant extract , a plant gum , a natural petroleum source and a plant oil or animal fat in the funerary wrappings in unopened tombs at @entity21 , in the region of @entity14			1
the embalming agents that were found make up a similar recipe to those used at the zenith of @entity37 mummification around 3,000 years later			1
the textile sample is held in the @entity40 museum and was collected in the 1930s , according to the study published in @entity43			0
academics say that the 11 - year study , which also involved @entity46 in @entity47 , rewrites our understanding of the ancient civilisation			1
traditional theories on ancient @entity8 mummification suggest that in prehistory - the @entity54 and @entity55 periods between around 4,500 and 3,100 bc - bodies dried naturally through the action of the hot , dry desert sand			2

this ancient flax is heavily impregnated with resin experts identified a pine resin , an aromatic plant extract , a plant gum , a natural petroleum source and a plant oil or animal fat in the funerary wrappings in unopened tombs at @entity21			1
this cloth has been treated with multiple layers of resin embalming was practiced for over 2,000 years and was an important after life ritual			2
religious ceremonies accompanied the preparation of the body for the afterlife			0
priests wrapped the mummy with linen strips containing resin , placed the internal organs in the specially prepared canopic jars and blessed the entrance of the mummy ’s tomb at the funeral			0
the mummified remains remain in good condition because the process successfully removed moisture from the body to slow down the process of decay			0
the @entity106 believed the body was the house of the soul so even after death the spirit could only live on if the body was preserved forever			0
if the body decayed , so too did the soul			0
in @entity8 religion , the soul was made of the ka , which remained in the tomb , the ba , which was free to fly outside the tomb and the akh which travelled to the underworld for judgement			0
early use of resins in artificial mummification has , until now , been limited to isolated occurrences during the @entity125 in around 2,200 bc. the practice became more popular during the @entity127 between 2,000 and 1,600 bc. dr @entity128 , a research fellow at the @entity129 , conducted the chemical analyses of the balm			0
‘ the antibacterial properties of some of these ingredients and the localised soft - tissue preservation that they would have afforded lead us to conclude that these represent the very beginnings of experimentation that would evolve into the mummification practice of the @entity37 period , ’ he said			0
‘ having previously led research on embalming agents employed in mummification during @entity14 ’s @entity37 period it was notable that the relative abundances of the constituents are typical of those used in mummification throughout much of ancient @entity14 ’s 3,000 year @entity37 history			2
‘ these resinous recipes applied to the prehistoric linen wrapped bodies contained antibacterial agents , used in the same proportions employed by the @entity8 embalmers when their skill was at its peak , some 2,500 to 3,000 years later			2
’ professor @entity159 , who was responsible for dating the burials at the @entity161 , said : ‘ this work demonstrates the huge potential of material in museum collections to allow researchers to unearth new information about the archaeological past			0
‘ using modern scientific tools our work has helped to illuminate a key aspect of the early history of ancient @entity14			0
’ the linen was wrapped around bodies laid to rest at at ancient city of @entity21 ( marked on the map ) in the region of @entity14 , which is home to one of the earliest recorded ancient @entity8 cemeteries early use of resins in artificial mummification has , until now , been limited to isolated occurrences during the @entity125 in around 2,200 bc. on the left is a priest 's coffin dating from @entity188 and on the right the preserved body of ' the @entity192 mummy ' which dates from @entity193			1

@entity202 predates earliest scientific evidence of embalming by a millennium
ingredients used *included* pine resin , plant extract and animal fat
recipe was similar to those used 3,000 years later to embalm *pharaohs*
experts say 11 - year study *re-writes* our understanding of ancient civilisation
