by @entity0 published : 19:47 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 20:58 est , 15 november 2013 change : residents will have to be consulted over applications for small wind farms in their area under new rules - set to come in to force next month residents will have to be consulted over applications for wind farms in their area , under new laws set to come into force next month			1
currently only developers of a handful of the biggest wind farms have to discuss the implications of their projects with local people			1
but new rules from the department of communities secretary @entity18 will mean even small developments of two or more turbines which are at least 50ft high will have to go through a similar process			1
officials said smaller developments can have a major impact on local areas and be widely opposed - but often the first time residents are aware of them is when an application is received by the council			1
under the new system , a consultation will have to be publicised before an application is made - either by email or letter or in a public meeting			2
it will not guarantee more applications are rejected but will mean local residents get a greater say over the size and location from the start , when they have more opportunity to influence the process			0
mr @entity18 , the communities secretary said : ‘ we are making sure local people have a crystal clear voice in airing their opinions on wind turbines very early on			1
from day one communities should be centre stage in crafting plans that affect their lives instead of having them forced upon them			0
‘ ensuring communities have a greater say at an early stage allows developers to consider much earlier whether to pursue a proposal and what changes they should consider before putting forward formal plans			0
our changes allow people ’s views and other impacts to be taken into consideration much earlier			0
’ there are already 4,000 onshore wind turbines in @entity71 and it is estimated 10,000 will be needed by the end of the decade to meet targets to cut carbon emissions			0
but applications by developers , who stand to rake in tens of thousands of pounds in subsidies have angered local communities who think they blight the landscape and hit house prices			2
council planners already reject around half the applications they receive , but many are then approved on appeal by planning inspectors to champion green energy			0
standing up : @entity18 , communities secretary , said earlier this year the drive to build wind farms would no longer trump protecting the landscape mr @entity18 announced this year that the drive to build wind farms would no longer automatically trump protecting the landscape			1
in a major boost for anti-wind farm campaigners , their concerns about the visual and environmental impact must be taken into account , and that for six months his @entity104 department would centrally review some of the appeals to make sure residents get a say			0
wind farms are a running sore between the @entity109 and the @entity110			2
over a hundred conservative backbenchers , as well as some cabinet ministers , are opposed to onshore wind farms , which they say ruin the countryside and do not help mitigate climate change			1
@entity117 energy minister @entity116 said : ‘ these new rules will help ensure that in future people have a say earlier on in the process over where onshore turbines are sited			2
@entity119 is an important part of the @entity71 ’s energy mix , and both @entity126 and industry agree that these proposals will ensure that new turbines are appropriately sited			0

but new rules from the department of communities secretary @entity18 will mean smaller developments will have to go through similar process
officials said smaller developments of two or three turbines over 50ft can have a major impact on local areas and be widely opposed
