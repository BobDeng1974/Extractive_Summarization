the timing of the birth of the future monarch was on everyone 's minds today as the nation waited on tenderhooks for the little prince 's arrival			2
after the announcement that the baby boy arrived at 4.24 today , we now know he is a cancerian , like his father @entity13 and grandmother @entity14			1
astrologers predicted that if the @entity17 had a lengthy labour , the @entity16 could be a feisty @entity19 rather than an emotional cancerian			1
had he been born after 4.54 today , the child would have been a @entity19 , like its great aunt princess margaret , countess of snowdon , and @entity24			1
scroll down to watch video he 's a cancerian ! just like his father and grandmother , the royal baby narrowly avoided becoming a @entity19			1
if he had been born just half an hour later , we could have had a very different kind of @entity16 @entity32 of @entity33 went into labour at 5.30am this morning - with many suggesting the approaching full moon at 11.16am helped bring on the contractions			1
prince @entity13 was by his wife 's side at the private @entity39 of @entity40 in @entity41 , west @entity42 , where he himself was born in 1982			2
astrologer with @entity45 , @entity46 , says the timing of the baby 's birth this afternoon plays a huge role in his personality type			2
she said , as a @entity54 , the baby should be sensitive , caring , shrewd , family oriented and protective of their loved ones			2
she said the baby 's moon will be in @entity60 - which is the same star - sign as his mother			1
' this means the baby will share a lot of the parents ' personality traits			2
different personality types : @entity14 , @entity14 , pictured left at a live aid for @entity71 concert in 1985 , was @entity54 , while @entity72 , pictured in 1960 , was a @entity19 ' as a @entity54 , the child will be very family oriented like its parents and sensitive			1
cancers often appear strong on the outside but are very soft on the inside			0
' but with a @entity60 moon it would also be aware of its responsibilities and dependable			0
' traditionally those born under the star - sign of @entity54 arrive between june 22nd and july 22nd although the exact dates vary slightly every year			2
famous cancers include @entity88 president @entity87 , @entity91 actors @entity89 , @entity92 and @entity93 , and @entity94 , who gave up the throne for @entity97 divorcee @entity96			0
prince @entity13 , who was born on june 21 , is a cancerian as was his mother @entity14 , whose birthday was july 1			1
sharing signs : the royal baby is a @entity103 like @entity13 , pictured left , with a moon in @entity60 - the same star - sign as mother @entity17 , pictured right astrologer @entity108 said the future king or queen will be more conventional because it is a @entity103 , but would have been more of a ground - breaker if he was born tomorrow as a @entity19			1
mr @entity108 said the baby would also have a lot of ' go - get energy ' and star quality			0
' @entity117 and @entity118 are conjunct in @entity54 and that will give the baby a tremendous amount of go - get energy and that is already in motion , ' he said			0
he added : ' @entity117 and the @entity125 are also in a magnetic connection which will give the baby a star quality and a sparkling charisma			0
' meanwhile there have been numerous theories as to what caused the @entity17 to go into labour - whether it was the full moon , an electrical storm or just conventional ' @entity136 '			1
maternity wards are said to be busier during a full moon , although there is debate in the medical world about whether the moon does encourage women to go into labour			1
waiting game : members of the world 's media gathered outside @entity149 when @entity17 went into labour at @entity40 in @entity42 this morning @entity151 , of the @entity152 , said midwives often talk of how the full moon makes for a busy spate of deliveries			1
' it 's always sort of been an old wives tale saying that the full moon brings women into labour			1
midwives usually do say " i 'm on call			0
it 's a full moon			1
i 'll be busy tonight " , ' she said			0
' there was a study about 20 years ago at a hospital near the @entity170 which is a tidal river and it showed that on the full moon they did have more births			1
' the idea is that because the baby is surrounded by water , the time of the full moon and the high tide causes the waters to break			1
but there 's not enough scientific evidence to show it 's proven			0
' birth coach @entity183 , of @entity184 , said : ' as a doula ( birth coach ) who has supported many women in labour , there does seem to be some link between labour kick starting and a full moon			1
' there are also suggestions electrical storms and a drop in barometric pressure can bring on labour			0
famous cancers : former @entity88 president @entity87 , pictured , actors @entity92 and @entity93 were all born under the @entity54 star - sign western central @entity42 - near where @entity13 and @entity17 's @entity203 apartment is based - experienced isolated heavy rain , thunder and lightning strikes at 6am this morning - just at @entity17 was admitted to the @entity39 wing of @entity40 in @entity41			2
@entity208 , a forecaster with @entity209 , the weather division of the @entity210 , said : ' the storm affected western central @entity42			0
there were lightning strikes at around 6am and very localised , intense heavy rain and thunder			0
' we 've had high pressure with the sunshine but now there 's low pressure and it 's hot and humid which can cause thunder storms			0
' @entity151 said she had not seen a connection between labour and electrical storms			0
' we are full of electrolytes but i do n't know			0
it 's not something we 've discussed as a midwific community			0
i ca n't vouch for that , ' she said she added that babies also arrived to their own agenda and their own time scale and put in an appearance when they are ready			0
' nature has its own way of preparing for labour			0
before the baby comes , the body need to do some preparations and that 's very important , ' she said			2
a royal @entity19 : princess @entity24 , pictured presenting prince @entity244 with his campaign medal , was born on august 15 , 1950			1
the baby came close to becoming a @entity19			2

baby boy born at 4.24pm is a cancerian like his father and @entity14 , @entity14
@entity252 would have been a @entity19 if he was born just half an hour later
