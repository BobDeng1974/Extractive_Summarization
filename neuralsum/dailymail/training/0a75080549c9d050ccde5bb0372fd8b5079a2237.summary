@entity0 , the man officially recognised as the greatest living ranger , fell victim to a harsh , brutal truth when the curtain fell on his managerial career			1
@entity0 was — is — a @entity6 icon			1
he captained club and country			0
he led the @entity10 club to a @entity12 trophy * and * holds the record for league appearances , playing 496 games and scoring 120 goals while playing primarily in defence			1
he captured three domestic trebles , was @entity20 ’s @entity19 twice and received an mbe for services to football in 1977			0
@entity0 ( left ) was @entity20 captain in 1967 for their famous victory over @entity26 at @entity27 @entity0 was sacked by @entity6 , so @entity28 ( left ) knows that no - one is safe from the chop yet , in the end , none of this could protect him from the unsentimental realities of managing @entity6			1
@entity0 won two @entity35 and two @entity36			1
but in october 1983 , with @entity37 champions and @entity38 having triumphed in @entity12 , he was unceremoniously sacked			1
@entity28 knows this period of @entity10 history well			1
a @entity0 signing , he lived and breathed it			1
at times his own survival , in the early days at least , was seat - of - the - pants stuff			2
@entity28 knows more than most that no one – not even the greatest living ranger – is safe from the sack			1
he admitted as much after a 3 - 1 home defeat to @entity49 last month			2
that result left @entity52 six points clear at the top of the @entity54			1
a gap which has remained stubbornly hard to bridge in the weeks since			0
@entity28 applauds the @entity6 fans at the end of a match earlier this season @entity0 is such an @entity10 legend that he has a statue in his honour outside the stadium ‘ i do n’t think anyone is bombproof , ’ said @entity28 then			1
‘ i would n’t sit here for a minute and say i ’m bombproof			0
i ’m still wearing the flak jacket but nobody is bombproof			0
’ for that reason saturday ’s league meeting with @entity52 already has the look of a defining day for the current manager			1
@entity28 would be as close as anyone to @entity0 in the affections of the fans			1
but @entity73 , the new power on the throne , is no @entity6 supporter			1
the @entity10 manager already agreed to slash his salary in half but must still subscribe to the @entity80 ethos			0
a @entity6 victory would reduce the lead of the @entity85 club to three points and rank as one of the most important , critical victories of a managerial career which , so far , has been patchy and open to scrutiny			1
former @entity6 and @entity52 striker @entity91 expressed a commonly - held view when he tipped a doggedly consistent @entity52 side , free of off - field strife , to take all three points			1
‘ the pressure is all on @entity6 but i have to fancy @entity52 , ’ said @entity91			1
‘ they have shown consistency since the season started			0
they ’re the team full of confidence			2
’ @entity28 ( left ) jokes with his assistant manager @entity102 during training at @entity104 @entity28 looks on as his @entity6 side played a pre-season friendly agaisnt @entity106 in august if he ’s right , the margin at the top of the table becomes an awkward nine points			1
their finances precarious and predicated on returning to the @entity114 as soon as possible , the chances of @entity6 doing so at the first time of asking would diminish			1
@entity28 ’s position , bluntly , would come under intense scrutiny			1
amidst widespread assumptions @entity6 ca n’t afford to pay off the one - year rolling contract of their manager if they were to dispense with him , a new question would arise			1
could they possibly afford to keep him ? @entity28 , an eternal optimist , believes he is the man for the job and has been here before			2
‘ you are only as good as your last pass here , ’ he told the club website			0
‘ i probably know the club better than most and it goes with the territory			0
‘ the one thing about being a @entity6 player and being involved with @entity6 is that there is always the next game to make amends for a disappointment			2
’ the evidence they can do so is patchy			0
an eight - game run of steady , improving results suggested this was a team turning a corner at the right time			2
@entity0 scored the winning goal for @entity20 against @entity151 in a @entity153 encounter @entity28 ( left ) shakes the hand of @entity155 as he is substituted yet last weekend ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity157 , a dismal affair , prompted fury in a crowd of almost 30,000			1
amidst an ongoing off - field circus , a never - ending procession of furious , arcane statements issued by a cast list of unreliable , largely discredited characters , the level of support has remained a modern marvel			2
the people continue to turn up despite a fresh call this week from former director @entity171 for supporters to starve out the current board			0
amongst those who do stay away , the football being played is often cited as a factor			0
the status of @entity28 the player with supporters will never be damaged			2
in 15 spectacular years , he was top scorer in nine of them			2
the club ’s all - time highest scorer with 355 goals in 581 games , he played through the nine - in - a - row era			2
but as manager the jury remains out			0
his wit and personality makes @entity28 a popular figure			2
turning on the man does not come easy to supporters			0
taking pot shots at @entity194 would be preferable to some			0
‘ @entity198 has a lot of credit in the bank left over from his playing days , ’ confirmed @entity196 of the @entity197			0
‘ he left us with an awful lot of great memories and those wo n’t be erased			0
but it ’s sad that a dream job for him has come along in these circumstances			0
’ such circumstances are clear enough			0
the off - field travails of @entity6 are an ongoing soap opera			1
@entity28 has risked criticism for publicly backing the chief executives who have come and gone , lining their pockets en route , but retains a level of gratitude for his actions when the club lurched into administration in 2012			2
‘ i think , during very difficult times , he has kept the club afloat and he deserves enormous credit for the way he has done that , ’ added @entity196			0
‘ i believe that the vast majority of fans are grateful for the way @entity198 conducted himself during that period			0
‘ he steered the club through some difficult years			0
he was the finger in the dyke at that time			0
‘ he was left with a club which , for a spell , was a rudderless ship for a few months			0
’ reporters who flocked to @entity104 that february week still recall the @entity28 ’s car shuttling in and out of the training ground ’s wrought iron gates for meetings with administrators			2
most football managers , mercifully , will be spared the nonsense he has had to involved himself with			0
his job description has often gone far beyond standard terms and conditions			0
a transfer embargo and dismal finances made free transfers a must			0
even so , wages of £ 7,000 for some top team players in the lower reaches of the @entity257 struck many as a poor use of resources			2
@entity28 justified the cost by setting his sights on taking @entity6 back to the top as quickly as possible			1
player expense has not been the biggest problem			0
but there would still be irony in @entity52 — another club mired in financial turmoil — beating the @entity271 giants back to the top with a team of kids			1
‘ with @entity52 being six points in front , i think it ’s fair to say the game is perhaps more significant to @entity6 than it is to them , ’ observed @entity196			1
for @entity28 , a man defined by his @entity6 achievements , its significance can hardly be overstated .			1

@entity0 is a @entity6 icon , but was sacked in october 1983
for that reason , @entity28 knows no - one is safe from the chop
@entity0 holds the record for league appearances with 496 @entity6 games
