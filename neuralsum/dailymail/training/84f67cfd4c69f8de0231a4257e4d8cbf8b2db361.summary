@entity6 , seven , has undergone a life - saving kidney transplant , thanks to her grandmother @entity19 , 60 , in what experts believe is the biggest age gap between donor and recipient in the country doctors feared she would never be able to have a kidney transplant because of the blood transfusions , which drastically increased the chance her body would reject a donated organ			1

‘ i can survive quite nicely with one kidney and the difference in @entity36 is incredible , ’ mrs @entity19 said			1
‘ she is livelier , happier and able to do things she has never done before			0

the clots pose a danger , potentially causing stroke , heart attack , kidney failure and death			0
between 33 and 40 per cent of patients diagnosed with the condition will develop end - stage renal disease , leading to permanent renal damage			2
those suffering atypical @entity53 will suffer recurring bouts of the disease throughout their lives			0
the syndrome is not well understood , but it thought to be linked to an irregularity in several genes			0
however in some cases the disease can appear out of nowhere			0
in the @entity108 the number of cases of @entity53 is thought to be around 300 a year			2
in most cases a patient with atypical @entity53 will suffer fatigue , become irritable and lethargic to a point where they need to be admitted to hospital			0
there are three main causes of atypical @entity53 , pregnancy induced cases of the disease are the most common external source , while some cancers , @entity122 and other rare pneumonia diseases are also known triggers			2
a second major cause is familial or genetic cases			0
