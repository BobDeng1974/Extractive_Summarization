a stunning video of professional skiers wearing custom - made led suits as they glide down mountain slopes looks set to show the sport in a completely new light			1
the film , shot in @entity7 , shows world class skiers wearing incredible led suits as they perform spectacular stunts down pristine snowy slopes at night			1
the 12 minute film called @entity13 was shot by a team from @entity15 and released on the website @entity17 , according to @entity18			2
the team used the dazzling effects of the colored lights which reflected off the snow , lighting up the darkness to create stunning scenes			2
skiers @entity24 and @entity25 , two of the best skiers in the world took on the daunting task of skiing down the rugged @entity7 terrain and found it difficult during the night shoot			1
they filmed during the day and worked mostly at night , draping the skiers in giant light suits and hauled gigantic , high - powered lights into the backcountry and lit up entire mountains as a backdrop			2
‘ deep pillows and @entity7 spines , all filmed at night , with massive lights , custom made led suits , and a national governments worth of logistics , planning , and civil engineering , ’ said the filmmakers			1
and it is unlike anything seen before			0
the creative team had to take care of the led suits , which had 7,000 leds sewn onto each skiers ’ gear			1
dazzling : the effects of the coloured light reflecting off the snow is simply stunning in the footage @entity76 : they filmed during the day and worked mostly at night and lit up entire mountains as a backdrop lights : the creative team had to take care of the led suits , which had 7,000 leds sewn onto each skiers ’ gear slope : the team used eight 4,000 - watt lights , accented with smaller lights and gels to add contrast and fill often , some of the lights would burn out bringing filming to a halt while repairs were made			1
and the team faced other challenges whilst navigating the snow covered mountains			0
it proved to be a difficult task as the snow occasionally blew and billowed up around them creating conditions which are similar to driving with your bright lights on in a snowstorm			0
‘ a couple times the skiers were like , ‘ holy shit , that was scary , ’ @entity31 said			2
however , unperturbed , the team lit up entire mountains and used eight 4,000 - watt lights , accented with smaller lights and gels to add contrast and fill			2
the lighting and filming gear — which included several red @entity119 cameras and an octocopter — weighed 9,000 pounds			0
the ambitious crew got the equipment up the mountain in a helicopter , but there were also times when it was loaded into sleds and hauled up by hand			0
they needed five airplanes to haul everything in			0
‘ we wanted to do whatever we could to push the visual envelope , ’ @entity31 said			0
i they split filming into different segments , capturing the tree segments in @entity138 in late march , and steep skiing , in mountains of the @entity7 range in april			1
most of the filming took place at the @entity145 , @entity146 , and the @entity147			0
now , @entity31 hopes @entity13 will change the way that ski films are seen			1
