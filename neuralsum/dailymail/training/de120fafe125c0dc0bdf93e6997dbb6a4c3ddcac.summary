@entity5 photographer @entity4 , 27 , from @entity6 , teamed up with digital imaging retoucher @entity7 to dress the @entity10 masterpieces in clothes more likely to be seen on @entity13 hipsters			1
' i had this idea when i was walking in the @entity2 looking at different sculptures , ' @entity4 tells @entity17			1
' these sculptures represent most of the time gods or important people very far from our every day life			2
to make them " iconic " , their sculptor made them naked , without any element from a specific period of time			0
@entity32 's @entity31 sculptures in clothes tell a meaningful story while providing hilarious viewing @entity36 suns himself and relaxes in the nude in the original version of the statue ' i realised that it would make a great series of pictures if i could dress these statues up			1
of course , it was impossible to do it in real life as the museum would n't let me touch the statues			1
' ' i started to think about the way to do it and i finally found the right process			0
i made a casting of models to find people with the same body shape as the statues			2
then , i did a photoshoot in a studio with these models dressed in hipster clothing			2
' the important part of the shooting was to recreate the same light on the models and to ask them to pose in the same was as the statue they were representing			0
after that , it was possible to mix both pictures in post-production , using @entity71 to take the clothes from the studio shoot and put them on the pictures of the statues that i shot in the museum			2
' a fine @entity10 statue is kitted out in rolled up hems and rolled up sleeves for the @entity13 effect the original @entity82 by @entity83 is a nude sculpture in line with his childhood fascination with @entity88 ’s relativity research and study of environments and imagines with the idea that reality ' might not be as we see it ' , @entity4 changes the way we perceive these classic figures			1
@entity36 by @entity99 leans back wearing green rolled up trousers , a bomber jacket and neon shades while @entity104 by @entity105 looks dapper in a blue plaid shirt and @entity108 sunglasses			1
@entity82 , @entity109 of the gardens by @entity111 leans on a rock while appearing to wear a tight blue shirt with rolled up sleeves , rolled up trousers and trendy shades as @entity117 by @entity118 is kitted out in rolled up orange shorts and a denim shirt			2
the work forces the viewer to question what is real and what could be real			0
mums can be hipsters too : a female sculpture in @entity128 shades and a faded band tee tends to her baby grandfather of hip : in a tight checked shirt and @entity108 a philosophical type older figure becomes trends writing of his project , @entity137 says : ' who is to say that the figures presented in the stone of @entity10 were not the greatest representation of the human form known at that time ? ' the statues , with their clothes stripped away reveal a magnificence of shape & balance			1
but what were the @entity150 wearing when they were n't posing for sculptors			0
. ? ' appearance , in all its many nuances , present the character			0
' clothes maketh the man ' as @entity158 wrote in @entity159			0
' @entity161 ’s dress sense indicates one 's priorities , choices , and lifestyle			0
are you ' in ' or are you ' out ' ? ' @entity167 ? which tribe are you a member of ? which tribe were the men posing for these statues from ? ' hipsters in @entity173 presents a twist on themes taking the ultimate from the @entity178 world and adding a modern , contemporary twist with cropped trousers , @entity108 and plaid shirts - ' making the icons iconic '			1
the throwaway cotton skater dress is a hipster girl 's wardrobe staple			0
this classic statue works the look @entity32 ' takes the ultimate from the @entity178 world and adds a modern , contemporary twist ' meleagre by @entity118 looks a lot less hipster and more cherub - like in real life @entity4 produces 30 x 45 inch prints of each statue mounted with plexiglass for £ 1,500 each			1
his work is exhibited now at the @entity199 fair in @entity200 .			0
