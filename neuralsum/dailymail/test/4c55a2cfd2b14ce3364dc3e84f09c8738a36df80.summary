it may an unorthodox way of achieving @entity2 qualification , but @entity4 manager @entity3 would welcome doing so through @entity7 's @entity6 and @entity8 rankings			1
the top three nations in @entity7 's rankings qualify for the @entity12 , with @entity13 currently sitting third and @entity4 topping the @entity15 's @entity8 table			1
@entity4 have little left to play for as they sit ninth ahead of saturday 's match with bottom - club @entity18 at the @entity19			0
yet they could achieve @entity2 qualification regardless of where they end up in the @entity15 by finishing top of the @entity8 table			1
@entity4 manager @entity3 wants the club to qualify for @entity7 next season through @entity8 it is a case of the fewer yellow and red cards the better for @entity3 , but the @entity4 manager insists he has not instructed his players to keep their discipline at all costs			1
asked if his players should tone down their commitment for the final eight games , @entity3 said : ' i have n't told them that			0
' if we have done what we have done all season and we have been as good as we have been i should n't really need to tell them any more			0
' for us as a team to be where we are at this stage of the season shows that we have played the game in the right way and the right manner and achieved something that is out there to promote the game in the right fashion			0
' @entity3 shouts instructions at his @entity51 players during a @entity12 match against @entity53 in 2005 @entity3 led @entity51 into @entity12 qualification for the first time in the club 's history in 2005 , and knows first hand how it can attract players in the transfer market			1
' it was never easy but there were players of much higher quality interested in coming to @entity51 , there is no doubt about that , ' @entity3 added			2
' the journey may not be great financially , but it is not the financial journey we look for as footballers and managers – it is the experience			0
' it is the fact that you are competing in @entity7 which in itself may help in some of your recruitment areas – however you have got there			0
' @entity51 forward @entity79 scores a goal against @entity81 in the @entity12 back in 2006			2

@entity4 are currently top of the @entity8 rankings in the @entity15
should they finish there at the end of the season , they could qualify for the @entity12 next term
@entity3 is well *aware* of the benefits of being able to offer @entity2 football to players in the transfer market
@entity3 led @entity51 to @entity12 qualification in 2005
