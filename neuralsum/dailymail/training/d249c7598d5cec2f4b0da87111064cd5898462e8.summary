he said : ' it would break my heart to see our @entity9 break apart			1
' mr @entity2 the ‘ silent majority ’ who reject @entity3 independence to stand up against nationalist bullyboys			1
@entity2 addresses party activists in @entity5 , @entity3 today as he campaigned to keep the union together voters in @entity3 are due to decide whether @entity3 stays in the @entity23 in an independence referendum on september 18			2
mr @entity2 said : ' if @entity3 walks away from the @entity9 and votes for separation , it 's not for a trial period , it would be permanent			1
' he said : ' why is it suddenly a good idea to make your sister working in @entity31 or your brother working in @entity33 living in a foreign country ? ' why is it suddenly a good idea to split away from the organisations that have helped this country be everything it is in our world today ? ' i do n't think they have made a powerful case at all and i think they have left every single key question unanswered			0
' mr @entity2 said there is no certainty about what currency an independent @entity49 would use , if it would be a member of both the @entity23 and @entity52 , and what the costs of leaving the @entity9 would be			2
' none of the key questions have been answered , " mr @entity2 insisted			0
' it 's extraordinary when you think how long @entity59 has planned this moment			2
he 's had years to think of the answers but yet with 77 days to go you can see he is @entity59 the unready - not a clue about the enormous gamble he would be taking with our nation 's future			0
' the prime minister insisted the ‘ noise of the nationalist few ’ risks drowning out those with a quiet , deep belief in the future of the @entity9			1
he accused the @entity3 government of using ‘ threats and warnings ’ to try to prevent business chiefs speaking out about the dangers of voting for independence in a referendum due to take place on september 18			1

‘ i urge them to speak out , talk with their work forces about the strength of our @entity9 and then vote to keep it together			0
’ mr @entity2 , who has @entity3 ancestry , said he would be left ' heartbroken ' if the country voted to leave the @entity9 first minister @entity59 , who met the @entity130 at @entity131 this week , has seen support for independence fall to just 35 per cent in recent polls nearly half of @entity3 believe @entity59 should resign if he loses september 's referendum , according to a new poll			1

‘ the silent majority who feel happy being part of the @entity9 ; the silent majority who do n’t want the risks of going it alone ; the silent majority who worry about what separation would mean for their children and grandchildren			1
' mr @entity2 will add : ‘ with 77 days to go , we need the voices of the many to ring out across the land			0
for each one to realise that they are not alone because there are millions just like them			0
‘ and this is how we rouse them to find their voice			0
we tell them : we ’ve achieved so much together ; we ’re safer together ; we ’re better off together ; we ’ve got the best of both worlds together			0
‘ and finally let ’s tell them this : you can be proudly @entity3 and want to stay in the @entity9			1
‘ too many people in this country have been made to feel that you ca n’t be a proud @entity220 and say “ no thanks ”			0
you ’ve got to choose between the @entity222 and the @entity23 flag			0
loving your country means wanting the best for it – and for @entity3 that is staying in the @entity9			1
so yes – you can be a patriotic @entity220 and vote no. ’ @entity229 , chief executive of the pro-independence @entity49 campaign , said : ‘ @entity2 is seriously out of touch if he thinks there is a silent majority in @entity3 in favour of the @entity7 and their austerity agenda			1
' the reality is there is a very vocal majority against @entity2 governing @entity3 , with just a single @entity7 mp here			2
‘ thanks to the @entity244 system , another 30,000 children in @entity3 have been pushed into poverty because of @entity7 welfare cuts - yet the @entity244 parties want to spend up to £ 4 billion a year on new @entity249 nuclear weapons			0
' nothing better illustrates the need for a @entity170 vote in september , so that we can put bairns before bombs			0
