sued : @entity10 ( left ) is being sued by @entity6 ( right ) , who claimed he was forced out of his job of two and a half years at the tycoon 's sprawling @entity9 estate after snapping a tendon in his foot the tycoon , who owns a polo team and is friends with members of the royal family , founded @entity11 's largest foreign exchange dealership interexchange			1
he has lived in @entity2 for 25 years and is listed as the 115th richest person in @entity2 with a wealth of £ 860million by the 2014 @entity31			1
he owns vast amounts of land near @entity34 , @entity9 including a sprawling 3,500 - acre estate			1
in 2007 that estate famously grew to take in the entire @entity38 village of @entity39 , which was the backdrop for the @entity42 crime drama @entity43			1
mr @entity6 said he worked for the couple from june 2011 as an estate maintenance worker , first at their @entity47 estate and then at @entity48 , which employs 47 people , before he was asked to leave without notice in january this year			1
his claim filed today at a preliminary hearing in @entity53 , @entity54 , said his redundancy came just two months after he snapped his @entity57 tendon and had to wear a specialist boot			1
sprawling : the tycoon 's vast mansion on the @entity62 estate in @entity9 , which employs 47 people he told how managers ’ attitudes ' changed ' towards him , and he was called into a meeting with @entity66 , the @entity67 administration manager , on his return to work after @entity69 to be told he was ' no longer needed '			1
' i asked her ( miss @entity66 ) if there were any other jobs on the estate because i would rather be in work than out of work , opening the doors for some sort of negotiation , ' his statement said			0
' @entity66 said she would advise me if anything came up and i would be the first person they would consider and contact me , but there were no current roles			0
' i had to leave at 9.30am to take my company van to my home and empty all of my tools			2
' i did n’t even have time to say goodbye to my work colleagues who i ’ve worked with for over two and a half years			0
i received a letter the following day confirming i was no longer required			0
' ' i did n’t even have time to say goodbye to my work colleagues who i ’ve worked with for over two and a half years			0
i received a letter the following day confirming i was no longer required ' - former maintenance worker @entity6 but a week after he left , the estate took on the son of his line manager @entity99 , he said			1
and later that month his job was advertised in the local press and online without him receiving a phone call , he added			1
' this was very upsetting bearing in mind @entity66 said she would contact me if any jobs arose , ' he said			0
' i ’ve subsequently found out they have taken on another person in place of me			0
' mr @entity6 said his former employers refused an appeal to review his dismissal , and said he has remained out of work since despite attending three job interviews			1
' i am trying to secure work but i am finding this extremely difficult and am now suffering from depression , ' he added			0
lawyers for @entity6 and mrs @entity118 unsuccessfully attempted to get the case thrown out at today 's preliminary hearing - by claiming they had never directly employed mr @entity6			1
the judge heard the couple were directors of @entity124 , but the sole shareholder was @entity126 registered in the @entity127 - a ' well - known tax haven '			2
in turn , the sole shareholder of @entity126 was @entity131 - a foreign firm , the provenance of which remained a mystery			2
but the couple did not attend the hearing to explain who owns which companies , earning them stern criticism from employment judge @entity140			2
extensive : another set of buildings on the @entity11 tycoon and polo player 's large estate near @entity34 - on - @entity146 today he said their failure to attend ' could be viewed as an attempt to defeat the ends of justice			1
' he ruled that they did employ mr @entity6 , adding : ' no matter how far the chain ( of companies ) goes , there will eventually be a human hand operating it and pulling the strings			2
' @entity62 is owned by a chain of companies - we do n’t know how many , we do n’t know where they are , we do n’t even know the names of all of them			0
' we know two at least are offshore and one is in a well - known tax haven			0
i have no reason to doubt all of those arrangements are nothing other than proper and lawful			0
' however , it is reasonable to infer all those arrangements have been put in place for the benefit , ultimately , of human beneficiaries			0
' there was ' no evidence ' of those beneficiaries being ' anyone outside the @entity10 family ' , the judge added			2
the estate ( pictured ) is owned through a chain of companies including in a ' well - known tax haven ' , the judge said			0
there was ' no evidence ' of beneficiaries being ' anyone outside the @entity10 family ' , he added mr @entity10 owns an array of luxury properties across the world , including in @entity195 and @entity196			2
he lives in a grand mansion at @entity198 , part of the @entity62 estate , with his wife @entity12			0
she is a former @entity202 and a godmother of @entity204 , the daughter of the @entity205			0
the multi-millionaire also bankrolls his own successful polo team , the @entity207 , which is based on his sprawling 3,500 - acre @entity48 , comprising of the @entity208 , @entity126 and a deer park at @entity210 , @entity211			2
if the two parties fail to settle the claim , the full tribunal will go ahead in september			0
