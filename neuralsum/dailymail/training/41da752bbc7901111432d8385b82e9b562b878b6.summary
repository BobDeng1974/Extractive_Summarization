technology may be getting smarter , but humans are getting dumber , scientists have warned			0
evidence suggests that the @entity4 of people in the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 have declined in the last decade			1
opinion is divided as to whether the trend is long - term , but some researchers believe that humans have already reached intellectual peak			1
dumb and dumber ? evidence suggests the @entity4 of people in the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 have declined in the last decade			1
a study by the @entity16 claims the larger the global population becomes , the less intelligent we will be , dropping by around eight iq points by the year 2110 - and other estimates are even more pessimistic an iq test used to determine whether @entity7 men are fit to serve in the military has revealed scores have fallen by 1.5 points since 1998			1
and standard tests issued in the @entity6 and @entity8 echo the results , according to journalist @entity28 , writing in @entity29			1
the most pessimistic explanation as to why humans seem to be becoming less intelligent is that we have effectively reached our intellectual peak			0
between the 1930s and 1980s , the average iq score in the @entity36 rose by three points and in post-war @entity39 and @entity7 , test scores also increased significantly - a trend known as the ‘ @entity42 ’			1
this increase in intelligence was due to improved nutrition and living conditions - as well as better education - says @entity48 of the @entity49 , after whom the effect is named			1
an image of the future ? some experts believe we are starting to see the end of the @entity48 effect in developed countries – and that iq scores are leveling out and even declining			1
pessimistic scientists think that our descendants may struggle to understand subjects we can grasp ( illustrated with a stock image ) westerns have lost 14 iq points on average since the @entity68 age , according to a study published by the @entity70 last year			1
@entity72 thinks this could be because intelligent women tend to have less children than women who are not as clever , the @entity71 reported			0
the perceived link between iq and fertility is a very contentious one			0
dr @entity72 studied the results of 14 intelligence studies conducted between 1884 and 2004 to come to his conclusion			0
each study measured peoples ' reaction times - how long they took to press a button after being prompted			2
it is claimed that reaction time mirrors mental processing speed - so it reflects intelligence			0
they found that visual reaction times averaged 194 milliseconds in the late 19th century , but in 2004 , they had increased to 275 milliseconds			0
this would suggest that people have become less intelligent , they said			2
now some experts believe we are starting to see the end of the @entity48 effect in developed countries – and that iq scores are not just levelling out , but declining			1
scientists including dr @entity48 think better education can reverse the trend and point out the perceived decline could just be a blip			2
however , other scientists are not so optimistic			0
some believe the @entity48 effect has masked a decline in the genetic basis for intelligence , so that while more people have been reaching their full potential , that potential itself has been declining			1
some have even contentiously said this could be because educated people are deciding to have fewer children , so that subsequent generations are largely made up of less intelligent people			2
@entity123 , a psychologist at the @entity124 , calculated the decline in humans ’ genetic potential			0
he used data on average iqs around the world in 1950 and 2000 to discover that our collective intelligence has dropped by one @entity134 point			0
dr @entity123 predicts that if this trend continues , we could lose another 1.3 iq points by 2050			2
@entity137 , of the @entity138 , @entity139 , claims people ’s reactions are slower than in @entity68 times , and has linked it to a decline in our genetic potential			1
must try harder : psychologist @entity123 calculated the decline in humans ’ genetic potential			0
he used data on average iq test scores ( illustrated ) from around the world in 1950 and 2000 to discover that our collective intelligence has dropped by one @entity134 point			1
it has previously been claimed that quick - witted people have fast reactions and dr @entity137 ’s study showed people ’s reaction times have slowed over the century – the equivalent to one @entity134 point per decade			2
@entity72 , a psychology professor at the @entity70 , says westerners have lost an average of 14 iq points since the @entity163			2
he believes this is due to more intelligent women have fewer children than those who are less clever , the @entity71 reported			0
dr @entity137 and others think humans will gradually become less and less intelligent			0
but dr @entity48 says if the decline in @entity134 scores is the end of the @entity48 effect , scores should stabilise			1
he thinks that even if humans do become more stupid , better healthcare and technology will mean that all people will have fewer children and the ‘ problem ’ will regulate itself			1
tests carried out in 1980 and in 2008 showed that the average 14 - year - old was two iq points cleverer in 1980 , according to a study published in 2009			2
scientists found that performance dropped the most dramatically in teenagers in the upper half of the intelligence scale , @entity186 reported			0
brighter teens who took part in the study in 2008 were on average six iq points less intelligent than their counterparts tested 28 years earlier			2
professor @entity197 said the results could be the result of less intelligent youth culture			0
he used data gathered in iq tests on @entity6 children and found that children aged between five and 10 saw their iqs increase by half a point per year over three decades			1
' other studies have shown how pervasive teenage youth culture is , and what we see is parents ' influence on iq slowly diminishing with age , ' he said			0
' ... what we know is that youth culture is now more visually orientated around computer games than they are in terms of reading and holding conversations			0

iqs have largely increased since the 1930s thanks to better living conditions and education - a trend known as the @entity48 effect
but iq test results suggest people in the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 have become less intelligent in the past decade
opinion is divided as to whether the downwards trend is long - term
some studies have shown the average iq of @entity235 has *plunged* 10 points or more since @entity68 times and others claim it will keep decreasing
but other experts argue that even if we are becoming more stupid , better healthcare and technology means the ' problem ' will regulate itself
