historic : mrs justice @entity1 has sanctioned the first sterilisation of a man in this country because it is ' in his best interests ' a disabled man will have to be sterilised because it would damage his life to have any more children , a judge ruled yesterday			1
mrs justice @entity1 said the man , who has a mental age of between six and nine years , was deeply distressed when his girlfriend became pregnant four years ago			1
the child is now being looked after by his grandmother			2
however the judge decided sterilisation ‘ was in his best interests ’ as he could not be relied on to use condoms or other birth control methods to prevent another pregnancy			2
the 36 - year - old , who can only be referred to as @entity24 , is in a long - term relationship with his girlfriend – who also has learning difficulties			1
while he is dependent on his parents , the court heard that he had got to the stage where he could catch a bus , go swimming , or go and buy a coffee by himself			0
the judge made it clear that @entity24 ’s relationship with his girlfriend , which was disrupted by her pregnancy , should be supported and the couple ‘ should be permitted to resume their sexual relationship ’			0
but she said that having another child would threaten his hard - earned independence			1
and she insisted that the vasectomy would let him have ‘ as normal a life as possible as soon as possible ’			0
‘ @entity24 is unequivocal in expressing his wish not to have any more children , ’ she said			0
the application to mrs justice @entity1 , sitting in the @entity52 , was made by @entity24 's local @entity53 with support from his parents , his gp and the local authority involved in his care claiming the ruling would be in his best interests , she added : ‘ @entity24 ’s hard - earned achievements , whether they are learning to swim by imitation as he ca n’t process spoken instruction , or getting a bus on his own , must be treasured			1
’ the application to sanction a vasectomy had been made by the man ’s @entity53 trust , supported by his parents , gp and the local authority that organised his care			0
the ruling in the @entity52 is the first that has seen a judge order a man to be sterilised			0
the decision is the latest in a series of controversial judgements made by the court , which has been criticised for making secret rulings about people who are unable to manage their own affairs .			2
