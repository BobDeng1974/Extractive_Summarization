the tragic death of @entity1 who was killed by a great white shark on monday has again stirred up debate on whether sharks should be culled to help prevent this from happening again or if people should be more aware of the facts before swimming in the sea			1
mr @entity1 was killed in an area very common for sharks at this time of year			2
a great white was spotted circling just off these waters a few weeks previously			0
@entity15 ’s @entity14 put capture gear and drum lines around @entity18 on tuesday			1
but shark expert and environmentalist @entity19 believed that they were treating the symptom not the cause			1
in every situation where there has been a shark attack in recent times it ’s been when there ’s been increased numbers and sightings of sharks , ’ @entity19 explained			1
‘ there should be a better network of information where people know the activity of sharks in the area and make an informed decision on whether they should go into the sea or not			1
’ mr @entity1 was spearfishing when he was attacked at @entity18 on the @entity15 coast , around 70km east of @entity52			1
the 17 - year - old was mauled by the shark and his friend @entity55 only escaped death by putting the spear gun into the shark ’s mouth and firing the trigger			2
the dangers are apparent , but @entity19 explained that because the seal and whale population was increasing there ’ll naturally be a redistribution and increase of great white sharks coming inshore to feed			2
‘ to kill a shark that has attacked somebody is ludicrous			2
it ’s only responding to a natural stimulus that it has evolved with , ’ he said			0
@entity18 on the @entity15 coast , around 70km east of @entity52 , is where monday 's shark attack took place a @entity15 @entity79 boat is deployed at @entity18 to kill the shark shark expert @entity19 argues killing sharks is pointless as the shark is ' only responding to a natural stimulus that it has evolved with ' @entity87 managing director of @entity88 said one of his organisation 's vessels @entity89 would be going to @entity18 to monitor what was happening a key factor in recent attacks has been that victims have been spear fishing when they ’ve been attacked			1
it ’s a hobby that has cost some young people their lives			2
mr @entity1 is the second teen to be killed while spear fishing this month , following the death of 18 - year - old @entity103 , at @entity104 in far north @entity105			0
‘ when the fish is speared it begins to bleed and struggle			0
the vibration the fish makes in the water combined with the smell attracts the shark			0
it does make the chances of an attack even more likely , ’ @entity19 said			0
‘ again , information should be available so people can decide whether they should go out spear fishing in certain areas			2
you just need to be made aware			0
’ @entity15 ’s @entity79 reaction to monday ’s shark attack was to deploy capture gear and drum lines around @entity18 on tuesday in an attempt to catch the shark			1
@entity88 vessel @entity126 and its crew were headed from @entity129 to @entity52 today to keep eye on what the @entity15 @entity14 were up to at @entity18 @entity132 , a @entity14 spokesman said that if any shark of a comparable size – a four to five - metre - long great white – was caught it would be killed			1
' at this stage it 's highly likely that if we capture the shark that 's likely to have been involved in the incident it will be destroyed , ' he said			0
earlier this year the @entity15 government trialled using baited drum lines to cull sharks			1
the policy was hugely controversial and resulted in 170 sharks being killed			0
the @entity148 sunk the policy in a ruling earlier this year			0
however , the government is still able to use drum lines if they are threat to beach - goers , mr @entity151 was quoted saying in september			1
on tuesday environmental group @entity88 said they were also sending one of their members @entity160 with his boat @entity89 to @entity18 to herd any sharks away from the drum lines and if the fisheries do kill something to document it in full			1
‘ killing sharks wo n’t make a difference			0
there were sharks spotted in the area days before this incident occurred , so once again that information is not being sent throughout the community , ’ @entity87 managing director of @entity88 said			1
a @entity15 @entity79 boat is reversed into the water on tuesday before going on patrol around @entity18 earlier this year the @entity15 government trialled using baited drum lines to cull sharks			1
the policy was hugely controversial and resulted in 170 sharks being killed ‘ at certain times of the year there should be signage at beaches saying that great whites or tiger sharks have been seen in the area – to enter the water at your own risk			1
beach patrols should be carried out regularly too			0
’ mr @entity87 said that the @entity15 government once did a survey on the issue and results showed that 80 per cent of the people were against the killing of sharks			2
‘ mitigating the risk of entering the marine environment is up to the individual not the government , ’ @entity87 said			0
‘ so who is the government doing this on the behalf of ? they keep going on about a silent majority but their own survey shows that this silent majority does n’t exist			0
’ mr @entity87 said that a @entity15 government survey showed that 80 per cent were against the killing of sharks @entity15 has witnessed a number of shark attacks this year , some fatal			2
in september , @entity213 expat @entity212 , 50 , was killed in a shark attack in @entity215 , at the eastern-most point of @entity217			0
while @entity218 , 23 , from @entity219 , @entity15 , lost an arm and both hands when he came under attack by a great white in october .			0

@entity225 , 17 , was spearfishing when he was attacked and killed by a shark at @entity18 on the @entity15 coast
@entity15 ’s @entity14 put capture gear and drum lines around @entity18 on tuesday
shark expert and environmentalist @entity19 believes that this reaction is treating the symptom not the cause
‘ there should be a better network of information where people know the activity of sharks in the area , ' says @entity19
