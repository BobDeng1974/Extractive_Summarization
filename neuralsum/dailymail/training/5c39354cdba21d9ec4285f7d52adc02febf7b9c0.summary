the instinctive reading of the ball as it came back across the penalty area would be the envy of many a top striker as would the presence of mind to get in front of the covering defender			0
so too the smart outside - of - the - boot finish into the one area the goalkeeper could n't stop it			0
blink and you could imagine it was @entity14 out there earning the @entity16 a point in @entity18 or another goal - greedy striker of his ilk			1
for so long unsung and under - appreciated , it 's time , on the occasion of @entity24 's 100th international cap , to raise our glasses to a man who throughout his career has been a byword for presence and professionalism			1
@entity24 is not , nor has ever been , a glamorous player			2
there have been good times and there have been bad times			0
but his contribution , whether for @entity38 , @entity48 or @entity50 , has been marvellous			1
it 's quite easy to forget that @entity24 made 393 appearances for @entity38 over the course of his 12 years in the @entity84 first - team squad			1
and it may surprise the uninitiated that he has five @entity87 , an @entity55 , three @entity88 and the @entity53 in his trophy cabinet			0
add to that the 121 games he has played for @entity48 , many as captain , and that century of caps for his country			2
@entity95 is given a warning by @entity24 whose impressive career started at @entity38 nobody clocks up that amount of games by fluke			1
that 's why it was so wonderful , on his big history - making night , to see @entity24 there , in the 94th minute when all hope seemed lost , rescuing a precious point and avoiding an accident on the long road to @entity110			1
his beaming smile radiated out from many back pages on wednesday morning , his @entity112 eyes also smiling as they gazed up at the delirious travelling support high in one corner of the @entity31 in @entity32			0
this was @entity24 from @entity118 , sticking it to the world champions			0
one of @entity38 's own , a product of that prestigious academy , @entity24 slowly but assuredly worked his way up into the first team			1
admired by sir @entity125 for his versatility , @entity24 made his breakthrough as a 21 - year - old because he could play at left - back , right - back , centre - back or in central midfield			1
@entity24 scores @entity38 's fourth goal in a 4 - 2 win over @entity136 in february 2005 with a clever chip @entity138 jumps on @entity24 to congratulate him on his goal against @entity136 but would criticise his team - mate during their time together at @entity84 it did n't matter where he was asked to play , you could depend on @entity24 to produce a performance of efficiency and character			1
he 'll always be remembered at @entity84 for that outrageous lob over @entity149 from outside the box in @entity38 's 4 - 2 win at @entity136 in the 2004 - 2005 campaign			2
and equally he 'll be remembered as one of those criticised by @entity138 's acerbic tongue the following season			0
unlike many of those blasted in that never - aired @entity160 interview , @entity24 survived - and prospered , winning trophies at home and abroad			2
@entity24 celebrates with @entity163 after scoring a crucial goal at @entity165 which would help @entity38 go on and claim the 2006 - 07 @entity54 title he scored a critical last - minute winner at @entity168 as @entity38 won the title in 2006 - 2007 and was used as an emergency striker at times the following campaign , which he ended as a @entity174 champion			1
@entity24 scored against @entity136 in the @entity53 semi-final , first leg in 2009 , setting @entity38 on course for a 4 - 1 aggregate win and @entity125 put him in the team for the final with @entity181 as a reward			1
you see , critical goals in critical games are not a recent phenomenon for this man			0
perhaps the highlight was still to come - @entity24 was handed the captain 's armband for the @entity53 semi-final with @entity192 in 2011			2
it proved a fitting farewell			0
@entity24 is the current captain of @entity48 and led @entity38 out as skipper in a @entity53 semi-final against @entity192 in 2011 many believe there is n't life after @entity38 but @entity24 has proved an exception , a little like @entity201 at @entity202			1
joining @entity48 has meant flirtations with relegation and a few thrashings , but allowed him to develop his leadership skills			0
he has always been a positive presence both on the field and behind - the - scenes at the @entity210 , a future manager - in - the - making you would imagine			0
@entity24 is 33 now and will eventually decide to call it a day			0
he 'll bring the same level of dedication to whatever he chooses to do next			0
he 'll never be the most celebrated of players but that just makes those headline - grabbing moments like the one in @entity18 all the more magical .			2

@entity24 scored last - gasp equaliser for @entity16 in @entity18
defender 's goal in @entity30 qualifier came on his 100th cap
@entity24 has history of scoring crucial goals with @entity38
former @entity38 boss sir @entity125 admired @entity48 star 's versatilty
