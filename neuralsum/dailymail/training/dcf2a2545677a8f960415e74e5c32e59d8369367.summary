by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:12 est , 10 february 2014 energy secretary @entity3 has urged a probe into the scale of profits made by some gas companies shares in @entity9 lost £ 600million in early trading yesterday after the energy secretary suggested the firm could be broken up over claims of profiteering			1
@entity3 said the company ’s 11.2 per cent profit margin on gas was too high – and has written to regulators , raising the prospect they may see fit to break up @entity9 and parent company @entity9			1
@entity9 makes its money from selling @entity23 gas and by running electricity power stations			0
some say this supply business should be separated from @entity9 , which sells gas and electricity to households and businesses			0
the news sent shockwaves through the @entity33 with the value of shares of the @entity37 ’s largest energy supplier falling by as much as 4 per cent , or around £ 600million			1
they rebounded to end the day nearly 2 per cent down , which equates to a fall in value of around £ 270million			0
@entity9 and @entity9 , which has 41 per cent of the gas supply market and around 16million household accounts , insist their profit margins are modest and fair , running at around 5 per cent for gas and electricity combined			1
mr @entity3 said if you break out the figure for gas alone , the profit margin in 2012 was 11.2 per cent			1
in a letter to @entity51 , he wrote : ‘ there is evidence that @entity9 , the company with the largest share of the gas domestic supply market , has tended to charge one of the highest prices over the past three years , and has been on average the most profitable			2
’ in an accompanying note , he asks : ‘ does this indicate that @entity9 has a strong monopoly position which enables it to generate high profit margins ? ’ the letter , which was also sent to the @entity64 , asks regulators to consider all possible remedies ‘ including a break - up of any companies found to have monopoly power to the detriment of the consumer ’			1
@entity9 insisted it was complying with an ongoing independent market assessment being conducted by the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , @entity51 and the @entity75 ( @entity64 ) @entity9 rejected the attack and said it is already participating in a market investigation by @entity51 , the @entity74 , @entity51 and the @entity64			0
managing director , @entity79 , hit back , saying : ‘ @entity37 has one of the most competitive energy markets in the world , with gas and electricity prices among the lowest in western @entity85			1
‘ our parent company @entity9 does more than any other organisation to secure gas and power for @entity37 customers , with commitments totalling more than £ 60billion , and we can only shoulder responsibilities on this scale if we are a profitable business			2
’ the @entity96 union joined the battle and accused mr @entity3 of mounting a dangerous publicity stunt			2
its national secretary for energy , @entity99 , said : ‘ @entity3 has opportunistically unleashed a hugely damaging feeding frenzy on a @entity37 owned company			1
‘ this company has invested billions to securing reliable energy supplies for the @entity37			2
it employs and is committed to employing tens of thousands of workers in the @entity37			2
‘ @entity9 is probably the biggest employer of apprentices and trainees in the @entity37			0
hundreds of apprenticeships in smart metering that would have been created this year probably wo n’t be because of @entity3 ’s dithering over policy			0
he now threatens to wreck thousands of more jobs			0
’ the share price fell by as much as 4 per cent in early trading , which is equivalent to a drop of around £ 600million			0
it pared some of the losses by the end of the day to leave shares down nearly 2per cent , or 5.3p , to 308.9p , which equates to a fall of around £ 270m .			0

@entity3 urges energy regulator to examine profit margins at @entity127
singles out @entity37 gas for *criticism* for being ' the most profitable '
shares fall 3 *%* as the stock markets open and firm says it is *co-operating*
