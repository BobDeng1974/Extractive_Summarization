by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 in an era when supporters seem more distanced from their heroes than ever , it 's refreshing to see @entity7 give one fan an experience many football followers only get to dream about			0
the @entity12 top - flight club took on @entity13 in a recent friendly , but in their starting xi they named 13 - year - old @entity14 , who sadly suffers from an aggressive form of cancer			1
@entity14 had informed his nurses of his dream to play for @entity7 at the @entity19 , and the club were more than happy to oblige			0
the night would only get better for the 13 - year - old , who scored straight from kick - off after showing a few tricks ( and judging by @entity13 's woeful showing in @entity56 this term , we reckon his goal was not the result of generosity from the @entity63 champions			2
) having celebrated his strike with his team - mates , @entity14 was substituted to warm applause from the fans soon after as the @entity12 outfit went on to win the game 5 - 2			2
