forced into a head brace , bound and held up by police officers , or sitting down with their eyes rolled back in their heads - these are the harrowing faces of mental illness in the @entity9 era			1
diagnosed with conditions such as ‘ imbecility , ’ ‘ simple mania , ’ and ‘ acute melancholia ’ , all of them were patients at the @entity16 , @entity17 , in 1869			1
its first superintendent sir @entity18 , and later superintendent sir @entity20 , actually paved the way for ethical treatment of the mentally ill. @entity23 is renowned for bringing science to the asylum when he started a laboratory for anatomy , neuropathology and histology			1
these pictures , taken in 1869 at the @entity31 near @entity32 , @entity17 , show some of the patients interred there			1
while some of the treatment looks barbaric to modern eyes , in fact the centre pioneered the way for ethical treatment of the mentally ill the photographs are part of a 5,000 - strong collection of detailed documents on patients taken by sir @entity20 , the chief neurologist at @entity16 , who helped lead the way in medical treatment of mental disorders the @entity51 , based near @entity32 , was the sixth institution of its kind in the @entity54 to take those with mental conditions out of the way of regular society to a place of relative protection			1
to that end , the hospital - come - boarding house was entirely self - sufficient , housing its own bakery , butchery , dairy , shop and laundry			2
previously those with mental disorders were exhibited in bedlams , such as the famous one in @entity71 , imprisoned in cells , or chained to walls in workhouses			2
this new , relatively compassionate approach was driven by the asylum 's founder , @entity76 , a quaker who believed in the sanctity of life and of behaving kindly and morally to all of humanity			2
@entity83 , author of @entity84 , a book on the @entity16 , said : ' this new , relatively compassionate approach was driven by @entity76 the founder of the @entity87 which opened in 1796 after @entity88 , a @entity78 , died at the @entity90 asylum in 1790			1
' @entity76 , a quaker believed in the sanctity of life and of behaving kindly and morally to all of humanity			0
at that time dr @entity93 who superintended @entity90 asylum regarded the mentally ill as less than human , and while in the asylum inmates were denied access to religion and @entity99			2
' quakers , who believe there is a spark of divinity in everyone , were appalled by this			0
the retreat is still famous today for having pioneered the humane treatment and moral treatment that became a model for asylums around the world			2
' alongside each of the pictures are detailed notes including height , weight , religion , and eventual fate of the patient			1
a diagnosis is also written on some images			0
the patient on the left is recorded as suffering ' general paralysis ' , while the woman on the right has ' acute melancholia ' the @entity16 was actually comprised of four different hospitals , this sketch shows the building at @entity32 where these pictures were taken mr @entity83 added that life inside the asylum was still austere , with residents who were able to work given jobs in the laundry , gardens or working on farms that were sometimes attached to the hospitals			1
residents were often forced to pick clothes out a pile placed in the middle of a room , finding sizes that best fit them , while treatments were vary basic			0
one involved a spinning chair , the theory being that spinning a person around would help to cancel out the spinning in their heads			0
sir @entity20 also used the security of the asylum to begin his groundbreaking research into mental illness , investigating whether there was a biological cause behind the conditions he help to diagnose			1
he helped to take some of these portraits of patients , meticulously labelled with notes on the patient ’s appearance and ailments , and three years later collaborated with @entity167 on his book ‘ @entity169			1
’ @entity20 pioneered a medical approach to the treatment of mental disorders at @entity16 , banning the use of restraints unless necessary , keeping sedation to a minimum , and allowing patients to indulge in leisure activities and take up jobs as part of their healing process			1
he also published in - depth journals from his time at @entity16 containing observations from himself and his team on mental illness , treatments with various drugs known to affect brain function such as cannabis , nicotine , alcohol , and nitrous oxide			1
@entity16 was one of the first institutions to treat the mentally ill. previously those with disorders would have been locked in cells , put on display in bedlams , or chained up in workhouses ( left , a woman suffering from ' senile dementia ' , right a man with ' mania of suspicion ' ) while @entity16 started out as a poor - house for the mentally ill , it eventually became so successful and well - known that it started taking paying residents ( left , a woman with ' simple mania ' , and right another patient with ' mono - mania of pride ' ) the records kept at @entity16 were so detailed and extensive that they are now recognised as being of huge historic and medical importance , and are protected by @entity214			1
@entity20 ( pictured ) took over at @entity16 in 1866 when he was just 26 years old , and ran it for the best part of a decade			1
he left in 1875 to become the lord chancellor 's visitor in @entity217 the collection includes over 5000 photographs of patients from the late 1860s onwards , putting a face to thousands of the patient numbers			2
one patient was @entity224 , a @entity226 domestic servant , who was admitted in 1880			0
she claimed to be the ' queen of heaven , possessed of great wealth and had been crowned '			0
others case files show patients were suffering from general health problems such as symptoms which would be recognised today as post-natal depression			0
@entity235 of @entity236 was admitted in 1832 , aged 37 with 18 children			0
she was , rather unsurprisingly , ' feeling in a low despondent state ever since her confinement '			0
other women were suffering from social problems , including @entity242 , a @entity243 housewife , who was admitted in 1887 due to insufficient food and mistreatment by her husband			2
children were admitted into the hospital from as early as 1820 and until the opening of the separate @entity251 facility in 1901			0
examples from the @entity251 era include @entity254 of @entity32 , @entity17 , who was diagnosed of ' imbecility with epilepsy '			2
the remarks made on his treatment include an answer to questions regarding name and age , which he replied ' broken window ' and on asking him names of surrounding objects he replies ' @entity269 '			2
another mother of an 11 - year - old @entity243 boy in 1911 , said : ' i can not manage him			0
he is destructive , breaks and tears everything he can get to lay his hands on			0
i am obliged to keep knives out of his way and all windows closed			0
children in the neighbourhood are afraid of him			0
' under the guidance of @entity283 went from being a centre to house the poor and mentally ill to taking paying patients who were afraid of being taken elsewhere			0
but while the project initially set out to improve the treatment of those with disorders , overcrowding and a lack of funding eventually led to horrible conditions developing , with several patients killed during disease breakouts inside the facility			1
sir @entity20 's research helped pave the way of treatment for the mentally ill , including the theory that some illnesses occurred naturally , while others were due to outside factors ( left , a man with ' organic dementia , and right a woman with ' constructive dementia ' ) two men interred at @entity311 are pictured			1
while the patients were cut off from regular society , they were kept out of restraints as much as possible , allowed to partake in hobbies , and could get jobs at the on site bakery , butcher , or shop			0

photographs were taken at @entity16 by chief neurologist sir @entity20
while some pictures may appear barbaric to modern eyes , they asylum actually led the way in ethical treatment
each picture is *accompanied* by detailed medical notes and diagnoses including ‘ imbecility , ’ and ‘ simple mania , ’
