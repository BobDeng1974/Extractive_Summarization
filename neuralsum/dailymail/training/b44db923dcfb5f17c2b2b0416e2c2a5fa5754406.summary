@entity5 , who spent half of his three - year sentence in jail before being freed to commit his rampage , told journalists he and his six co-defendants were just ' passionate young kids from the suburbs '			1
we are just young kids from the suburbs , that is all			2
' we get passionate , we talk like this but there is nothing more , that 's it			2
' there was no intention ( from us ) , now they pretend things , but who cares			0
we will see and i hope that it will show evidence			0

i did nothing wrong '			0

' i condemn what was done , ' @entity98 said in an interview with the @entity109 news channel			0

murder : @entity5 and @entity119 before fleeing the scene of the attack on @entity11 's @entity8 offices regret : co-conspirator from 2008 @entity98 ( left ) has slammed the actions of @entity5 ( right ) ' that should not be attributed to @entity13			1
it 's the worst crime that a @entity128 could commit			0
' @entity98 said two months ago @entity5 came to see him ' @entity129 '			1
' the only thing he wanted to talk about was fighting , ' he said			0
' he did n't want to know about good relations with his neighbours , or acting like a good @entity128 '			0
@entity98 dismissed suggestions that he had ever been tempted to use violence and rejected the idea that @entity71 ' oppressed ' @entity128			0
' i am the proof that it 's the opposite , ' he said			0
' i have a criminal record that is rather hard for people to swallow			2
i have been convicted for terrorism , which is the worst offence			0
