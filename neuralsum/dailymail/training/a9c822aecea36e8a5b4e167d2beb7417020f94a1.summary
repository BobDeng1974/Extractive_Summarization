a long - running dispute between neighbours over two inches of land boiled over in bizarre fashion when one was caught on camera ripping down a set of iron railings			1
@entity8 councillor @entity7 was filmed pulling down the fencing put up by the elderly couple next door before smashing what was left with a hammer			1
@entity14 and @entity15 , who run an engineering business , said yesterday it was the culmination of a seven - year feud that began when they built a side entrance to improve access to their home			2
the couple , who are replacing the fence , claimed the 53 - year - old was a ‘ bully ’			1
‘ once he got going with the railing there was just no stopping him , ’ said mrs @entity15 , 58			2
‘ he ’s an absolute nightmare			0
he just bullies us and he ’s even got a file on me with everything written down and photos			0
‘ we ’ve had to do the same and that ’s why we have cctv cameras			2
but we wo n’t be moving			0
all i want is just to get on with my life			0
’ the dispute , on a quiet street in @entity35 , south @entity59 , escalated into a blazing row between mr @entity7 and 81 - year - old mr @entity61 last friday			1
former @entity62 ward councillor @entity7 was caught on camera pulling down the fence after a blazing row with his neghbours the former @entity59 council cabinet member for the environment was having his driveway resurfaced , and tempers flared over the fence , which he is understood to believe is fractionally on his property			1
as his stunned neighbours stood by , the father of two pulled down the wrought - iron fence with his bare hands before smashing its foundations with a hammer			1

mrs @entity15 claimed her husband , who suffers from a heart condition , had been driven to despair			0

‘ he wo n’t speak to us and he just ignores letters from our architects and surveyors , ’ she said			0
‘ if we are in the wrong then so be it , but i do n’t want to go the court and pay a load of money just to show a legal document			0
i think he does , just so he can laugh at us			0
’ the couple say problems began in 2007 when they tried to build a pitched roof and then a side entrance to help mr @entity61 get easier access to the house			1
they claim mr @entity7 halted the plan because the gutter would overhang his property by one inch			1
they say he built an archway which encroached on to their land			2

‘ i have tried everything to be neighbourly with him , ’ mrs @entity15 said			0
‘ but no one on the street likes him			0
they all think he ’s a bully			0
my biggest fear is what he will do if we give him this piece of land			2
