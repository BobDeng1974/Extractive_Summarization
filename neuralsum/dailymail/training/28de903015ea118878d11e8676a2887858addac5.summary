by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 has banned a string of iconic @entity6 foods including @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity12 bars , it has been claimed			1
government inspectors reportedly swept products off the shelves of a specialist food shop after telling its owner they contained unapproved ingredients			2
the ban came to light after @entity22 , who owns three expat shops including @entity24 in @entity25 , central @entity3 , had his @entity27 shipment impounded by customs officers			1
@entity29 : love it or hate it , @entity30 will apparently have to do without @entity7 in @entity3 thanks to food laws smear : in a letter to a shop owner , authorities said @entity7 contained ' enriched vitamins and minerals ' he then received a letter from the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) saying the products contained unapproved ingredients - before officials removed them completely last week			1
mr @entity22 said he had been selling several of the products since he opened his first shop in 1997 with no complaints			1
‘ we ’ve been bringing @entity49 in since the very beginning , ' he added			1
' my understanding was we were importing legally			0
‘ we ’ve been declaring it through a customs broker and we ’ve never had an issue until now			0
' the concern now is , with the next shipment , if it gets held there may be new issues with new products , so it somewhat paralyses our ability to bring new product in			0
' illegal : @entity49 also made the list for containing the red food colouring @entity67 ( file photo ) one customer , @entity69 , said he regularly visited to the shop for @entity8 and @entity71 soup - both of which were removed			1
he said : ' i can feel for @entity22 on this because i think it 's unfair that he 's been in business since 1997 and now they 're all of a sudden stopping it			2
' it 's good enough for the @entity6 , it should be good enough for @entity3			0
' in a letter to mr @entity22 , @entity41 said @entity49 from @entity6 contained the red food colouring @entity67 , which is not on its approved list of food additives			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity10 , @entity88 and @entity9 , meanwhile , ‘ are enriched with vitamins and minerals ’ and therefore illegal			1
other products like canned soup and stock contained too much animal product , according to the body			0
mr @entity22 said he had heard @entity41 was conducting a health - risk assessment to see whether the ruling could be overturned			2
iconic : @entity7 is a @entity6 staple , but it is one of several foods banned in a letter to a @entity3 shop owner he said : ' when this health - risk assessment is done we should know definitively whether you can import @entity49			1
' a spokesman for @entity107 , which makes @entity49 , said the company produces a @entity3 - specific product in a specially - labelled 500ml plastic bottle which does not contain @entity67 , and has been exporting via a local distributor for more than 15 years			2
it is the only @entity49 product @entity107 exports to @entity3 , according to the spokesman			2
but mr @entity22 said to his knowledge , all @entity6 specialty shops in @entity3 were selling the @entity6 recipe			0
@entity3 is home to one of the largest populations of @entity119 expats			0
the @entity41 has yet to comment			0
@entity49 maker @entity107 ’s website said the company was working to replace the food colouring to bring it in line with guidelines set by the @entity6 ’s @entity125			0
however , the company assured the public the colouring is safe .			0

@entity29 came to light in a letter to expat @entity22 , who owns @entity24
