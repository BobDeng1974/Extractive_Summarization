yesterday pensions minister @entity17 , architect of the reforms , said anyone cold called by a firm offering them a free pensions review should ' put the phone down '			1
there is already growing evidence that scammers are gearing up for the april 6 pension ' liberation day ' in three weeks @entity28 will undergo a pensions revolution allowing older workers to cash in their pension pots and spend the money as they wish , rather than having to buy an annuity ' you can spend years saving into a pension only to find yourself tricked out of your money in the blink of an eye , ' he warned			1
in three weeks @entity28 will undergo a pensions revolution allowing older workers to cash in their pension pots and spend the money as they wish , rather than having to buy an annuity			1
but the @entity8 fears it could be a bonanza for sharks and ' snake oil salesmen ' targeting older people with texts and cold calls to try to get their hands on their pension pots			1
anyone who hands over their investment as a result of scam messages could be left penniless – and still facing a huge tax bill			1
criminals are urging pension savers to invest in scams ranging from dubious wealth funds to overseas homes that do not even exist			1
there is already growing evidence that scammers are gearing up for the april 6 pension ' liberation day '			1
tricks include luring pensioners with the promise of impartial advice			0
the number of spam calls and texts related to pensions reported to the watchdog rose by 66 per cent in february			1
pensions minister mr @entity17 has in recent months admitted he himself was cold called and sent spam texts about pensions			1
yesterday pensions minister @entity17 , architect of the reforms , said anyone cold called by a firm offering them a free pensions review should ' put the phone down ' last month he told a conference he had received a text saying : ' if you have a frozen pension prior to 55 you are entitled to a free review			1
' yesterday the @entity8 served a legal notice on a company in @entity92 , @entity93 , for sending nearly 190,000 spam texts including many thousands about pensions			1
one message said : ' as you have over 10k in your pension , your pension has lost £ 3,219.43 over the last few years , to get back & find out your payout reply review			1
' the message was identified by the @entity8 as being both deeply misleading and sent to those who had not signed up for direct marketing , as the law requires			0
they fear claims farmers are using the promise of free advice or a windfall investment to gather thousands of pensioner details to sell on in the wake of the reforms			2
the @entity8 said @entity113 @entity93 told a ' web of lies ' about how it obtained the recipients ' contact details			0
the enforcement notice requires the firm to stop its activities or it could face court action			0
new rules which come into force on the same day as the pensions reforms will allow the @entity8 to impose fines of up to half a million pounds on cold call and nuisance text firms			1
@entity128 of the @entity8 said : ' there is clearly the potential for a huge spike in the number of these scam texts and calls			2
it has the potential to be the next @entity10			0
' the @entity136 added its voice to the warnings			0
chief executive @entity139 said : ' the people behind pension scams are often agile , sophisticated and organised			1
we expect the scams to continue to evolve			0
' @entity144 , chief executive of another regulator , the @entity145 , said he was seeing an ' accelerating trend ' in activity by fraudsters			0
the reforms were widely welcomed last year as a response to concerns that annuities had become poor value for money			2
retirement pots can be used like a bank account , with many restrictions abolished			2
there have been concerns , however , that some pensioners might squander their savings on cars or holidays			0
how crooks will target you promised pension freedoms herald a bright new dawn for millions of savers			2
unfortunately , they will also act as a clarion call for crooks to target millions of pounds about to be unlocked by the trusting and the unwary			0
the danger lies in scammers ' ability to contact you by phone , text or email – and their persistence to wear you down			0
their first approach is usually the most enticing			0
a text might typically offer a ' free pension review ' , ' one - off investment opportunity ' or promise of ' upfront cash '			1
but the minute you respond to the cold - caller , they 'll begin to crank up the pressure			0
their prize is your pension pot – and they need you to agree to sign a funds transfer form to get their hands on it			1
so the promises will come thick and fast			0
they might suggest juicy returns of 8 per cent or more , talk authoritatively about locking away cash in overseas investments or dangle cashback payments			2
to soothe fears , they may also claim to be a @entity210 adviser or say they 've been endorsed by officials			2
and while there will be talk of you , at 55 , having plenty of time to lock your money away , there will be no mention of the imminent tax bill you 'll need to pay			2
the fee they 'll charge , perhaps as high as 30 per cent , will be glossed over			0
it might take a dozen or so emails and phone calls – or even ten times that – but once you 're hooked , they 'll then push you to sign a transfer form as soon as possible			0
this may be sent to you by email as a form to fill in online or even couriered over to your front door			0
you 'll be convinced it 's a simple final matter of filling in the details of your existing pension scheme – usually its name and number			2
legally , your original pension provider – usually an insurer – can only agree to transfer the money on the condition it will go straight to another registered pension @entity245 , the scammers – acting as the broker – do no such thing			1
they 'll take the money and then release only a chunk of it to you as a loan or cash sum			1
and once your funds are released from your insurer and into a new account – often overseas and outside @entity93 jurisdiction or the arm of the regulator – then your chances of ever seeing the cash again will vanish			2
you may find the scammer picks up the phone the first time you call to check up on your investment – but they wo n't be there the next time			2
as well as the hefty fee , @entity269 will then slap you with a tax charge of up to 55 per cent because you 've taken out an ' unauthorised payment ' from your pension			0
always check the credentials of the company and any advisers , who should be registered with the @entity145 at fca.org.uk			0
if you think a company is trying to get you to liberate your pension , report the company to @entity280 or call it on 0300 123 2040			0
it can prosecute companies found breaking the law .			0

in three weeks @entity28 will undergo a pensions revolution as rules change
older workers will be able to cash in pension pots and spend their money
but fears it could be a bonanza for sharks targeting older people
anyone who hands over investment *due* to scam could be left penniless
