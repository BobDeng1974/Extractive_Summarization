by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 18:21 est , 22 june 2012 fight : @entity1 with his mother seven times more @entity4 citizens have been sent to the @entity6 under the lopsided @entity7 than there have been @entity6 sent in the opposite direction			1
@entity11 figures reveal how the treaty at the centre of the case against @entity16 ’s sufferer @entity1 is being used by the @entity6 authorities far more often than their @entity4 counterparts			1
since 2004 , 99 people have been extradited from the @entity4 to the @entity6			1
yet only 44 have been extradited to the @entity4			2
when the figures are broken down by nationality , the picture is even more stark			0
some 35 @entity4 nationals have been extradited from the @entity4 to the @entity6			1
but as few as five @entity6 citizens have been extradited from the @entity6 to the @entity4			1
@entity4 has extradited more of its nationals to the @entity6 in the past six months – seven – than the @entity6 has sent the other way in the past five years , according to data unearthed by the @entity29 mp @entity28			1
this is despite the fact the population of the @entity6 ( 311million ) is five times greater than that of the @entity4 ( 62million )			1
the figures will heighten calls for changes to the @entity7 , which was passed by @entity37 in 2003 and is currently under review by the home secretary			0
critics say it is biased against @entity4 nationals			2
@entity4 must provide @entity6 authorities with ‘ such information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the offence for which extradition is requested ’			1
this is known as the ‘ probable cause ’ test and means @entity6 citizens have the right to a court hearing to examine the evidence against them			2
however , if the @entity6 wants to extradite a @entity4 citizen , the authorities need only to outline the alleged offence , the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect			1
@entity29 mp @entity28 unearthed the alarming figures the most high - profile victim of the @entity7 is mr @entity1 , who faces being hauled to the @entity6 for crimes committed from his @entity64 hacked into @entity66 and @entity67 computers while looking for evidence of ‘ little green men ’ medical experts say he is likely to take his own life if extradited			1
as well as his , there have been a string of other controversial extradition cases			0
they include @entity76 , a retired golf club president from @entity77 who was extradited to the @entity6 in february over allegations of arms dealing			2
student @entity80 , of @entity81 , is also fighting extradition on copyright infringement charges over a website he ran from the @entity4			0
last night mr @entity28 , who has campaigned for changes to the extradition rules , said : ‘ in 2012 , we are surrendering our citizens to the @entity6 at the fastest rate since the new treaty came into effect , despite woefully inadequate safeguards			2
overall , we have extradited seven @entity4 nationals for every @entity6 extradited to @entity4			1
if we do n’t reform our blunt extradition regime , we will see more appalling cases			0
’ campaigners are also demanding changes to the controversial @entity98 ( @entity98 ) , which allows people to be sent to other @entity101 countries over even minor charges			0
as with the @entity7 , the country demanding a @entity4 or @entity101 citizen does not have to make a substantial case against them			0
the number of @entity108 issued to the @entity4 has risen from 1,865 in 2004 to 5,832 in the year ending march 2012			0
@entity4 is extraditing 11 times more people than are being sent to the @entity4 by our @entity101 neighbours			0
the number of @entity4 citizens surrendered under an @entity98 has risen from five in 2004 to 32 in 2011/12			0
mr @entity28 said : ‘ @entity4 now extradites six times more of our nationals under the @entity98 than the @entity6 treaty			1
too many face corrupt police , incompetent courts and appalling prison conditions			0
‘ the case for reform or withdrawal from this flawed measure is overwhelming			0
’ a @entity11 spokesman said : ‘ we have effective , fair and balanced extradition arrangements with the @entity6 and other international partners			0
‘ people who have committed serious offences such as murder , rape , other sex crimes and fraud , have been successfully extradited to the @entity4 and convicted			2

@entity29 mp @entity28 unearths *damning* figures
