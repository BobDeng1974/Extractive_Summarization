while helping run the @entity6 restaurant , @entity56 , @entity1 is accused of keeping two sets of payroll records			1
the one he turned over to the restaurant 's accountants , who used them as the basis for their tax returns , showed lower payouts to employees than he was actually paying them - as he opted for cash payouts of either half or all of their earnings so that there was no trail			2
the perjury charge , however , comes from a deposition in january 2013 where he allegedly lied under oath			0
past practices : @entity1 , 44 , has been under investigation by the @entity77 since the fall pertaining to his campaign fundraising practices but today 's charges are expected to be unrelated ( pictured in january ) laying out their case : @entity12 attorney @entity83 is one of the prosecutors who came up with the 20 counts that @entity1 now faces , focusing the investigation on his time before running for office dirty dealings : the prosecutors looked into his involvement with a health food restaurant on the @entity26 called @entity56 after former employees complained of getting less than minimal wage the deposition came when former employees accused @entity1 of paying them less than minimum wage			1

in this 20 - count indictment , representative @entity1 lived by a new motto : fraud , perjury and obstruction			1

his case : the @entity8 congressman has been released on bond after entering a not guilty plea to many , his involvement with the restaurant was not the most expected source of his legal troubles , as @entity1 has been under investigation for months for questionable fundraising practices relating to his congressional campaigns			1

from the beginning , the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against @entity159 and not an independent search for the truth , ' mr @entity148 said			0
connections : @entity1 was an investor in this @entity26 health food restaurant and someone related to the restaurant is believed to be the connection between the @entity1 and his alleged campaign finance issues ' after more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks , violations of grand jury secrecy , and strong - arm tactics , the @entity169 has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against @entity1			1
' congressman @entity1 asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing			0
when the dust settles , he will be vindicated			0

rabbi @entity187 is believed to be one of the ten wealthiest rabbis in @entity186 though his base of global operations is @entity110			0
@entity1 's team admitted that their campaign received between $ 250,000 and $ 300,000 from the rabbi 's supporters - some of whom admitted to making tens of thousands of illegal contributions			2
investigation : @entity200 ( right ) who was previously in a romantic relationship with @entity1 ( left ) was charged on friday with lying to the @entity5 and making up false donors to illegally funnel his campaign money @entity204 , who was the liason between @entity1 and the rabbi 's followers , pled guilty to an immigration fraud case in august and then three days later , the @entity5 filed a sealed criminal complaint against one of @entity1 's former lovers for using straw donors to make illegal contributions			1
