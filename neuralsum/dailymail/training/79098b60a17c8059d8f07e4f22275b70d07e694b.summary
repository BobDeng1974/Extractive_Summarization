@entity2 grandmother @entity12 , 56 , was sentenced to death after being caught with £ 1.6 million of cocaine at @entity15 last year , despite helping police by naming four others she said were in the smuggling syndicate			0
by comparison , a 54 - year - old man , named only as @entity21 , has received a reduced and relatively light sentence for the brutal rape of his daughter , infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease and causing such severe injuries that she later died in hospital			1
@entity2 grandmother @entity1 , 56 , pictured earlier this year , remains behind bars at a prison in @entity4 , a province in @entity8 , under a sentence of death for drug smuggling while a father who raped his nine - year - old daughter so viciously she later died in hospital from her injuries received just 15 years the prosecution had demanded the man be sent away for 18 years but female chief judge @entity39 , sitting in the @entity40 , decided on just 15 years			1
in addition to the lenient jail sentence , @entity21 was fined just £ 25			2
the court heard that @entity21 was named a suspect not long after his daughter , identified only by the initial @entity46 , died at @entity47 in @entity48 on january 6 following two weeks of intense medical attention			2
the @entity50 reported that her doctors said she had suffered from brain inflammation and sustained injuries from a blunt object being inserted into her			0
the doctors also said she had been infected with a sexually transmitted disease			0
horrific : the father , from @entity48 , @entity8 , pictured , was ordered to serve just 15 years in prison for the brutal rape of his daughter which lead to her dying from her injuries police told the court that @entity21 admitted raping @entity46 in october of last year at their house in @entity48			1
but the father managed to tell reporters after the verdict that he had never raped his daughter , insisting he confessed his guilt to police only in order to protect his family			2
' i never did that , ' he said			0
' i made the confession just so that this can be over quickly and so that police would no longer summon my family , ' he said			0
just 24 hours earlier it emerged from the neighbouring country of @entity81 that an 18 - year - old girl who had been raped by her father killed him by chopping off his head with a bush knife			1
police said yesterday they were determined to question the girl , even though villagers said they had formed a protective ring around her because she had ' done the right thing ' by killing her ' evil ' father .			0

the 54 - year - old father , named only as @entity21 , raped his daughter , aged nine
he *inflicted* such severe injuries during the attack she later died in hospital
