a man stuck by a serious bowel infection has been cured after undergoing a faecal transplant , with stools donated by his daughter			1
@entity5 shed three stone as he battled the life - threatening condition @entity7 , suffering bouts of diarrhoea			1
he lost his appetite and endured continuous pain			2
despite numerous courses of antibiotics during long spells in hospital , the 75 - year - old was showing no signs of improvement			2
it was then that specialists suggested a faecal transplant			1
@entity5 , 57 , from @entity23 , has been cured of the severe bowel infection @entity7 after undergoing a faecal transplant			1
his daughter @entity26 , left , acted as donor ' i 'd never heard of it before , ' said mr @entity5			1
' i thought , " come on , you 're taking the mickey "			0
' but my doctor explained that mixing healthy poo with my poo - and transferring it back into my bowel mixed with warm water - would give someone 's healthy bacteria the chance to fight with my bad bacteria			0
and when gastroenterologist @entity41 raised the issue of finding a suitable donor , mr @entity5 ' daughter @entity26 stepped in			1
the 52 - year - old 's stools were tested to ensure they were suitable and free from harmful bacteria			2
mr @entity5 , from @entity23 , was then admitted to the @entity48			1
the procedure aims to re-balance the bacteria in the gut , by introducing bacteria from the faeces of healthy people			0
once ms @entity57 ' stools were approved , they were mixed with water and filtered			2
the solution was then transplanted into mr @entity5 ' gut via an endoscope - a long , thin , flexible tube that has a light source and a video camera at one end			1
' i had a bit of sedation but watched it all happening on the screen in the endoscopy unit , ' he said			0
@entity71 dr @entity41 performed the procedure at the @entity48 ' i was interesting			0
i knew it had worked straight away			0
' the next day dr @entity41 said i could go home and everything was back to normal			0
' dr @entity41 , said : ' faecal transplantation does n't sound very appealing but it 's a very effective remedy in patients like @entity5			1
' transplanting faeces from one person to another does seem a bit unusual but actually it 's using healthy gut bacteria to fight off infection			0
' our bowels are packed full of billions of bacteria and these play an important role in maintaining health			0
' dr @entity41 said there had been a significant reduction in the number of c - diff cases in the trust over the past few years but it was reassuring to know that faecal transplant was now an option to treat the condition			1
in march last year the @entity100 published new guidelines , naming faecal transplants as a recognised form of treatment for c - diff infections			2
experts deemed the procedure is ' safe enough to be used in the @entity108 '			0
an analysis of seven studies , involving 558 patients , revealed nearly all patients were cured			0
in one study , the infection came back in around one in 20 patients within five weeks , compared with more than half of the patients given antibiotics			2
in another study , the infection came back in around one in 50 patients between 29 days and four years after faecal transplant			1
@entity100 concluded it did n't make much difference if the transplant was from a relative or stranger , or if the transplant had been frozen or not .			0

@entity5 , 75 , lost three stone while battling *clostridium* *difficile*
when antibiotics failed to work specialists suggested a faecal transplant
