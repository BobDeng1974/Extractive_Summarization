@entity0 : 13:04 est , 31 december 2013 updated : 04:44 est , 1 january 2014 with its dark panelled walls and shelves crammed with books , there are hardly any clues to suggest this cosy study is n't at the heart of @entity10 and its dreaming spires			2
but the seemingly old - fashioned room has only just been installed at @entity13 in @entity14 to encourage its students to set their sights on the @entity18 ’s top universities			1
a room at the college has been completely made - over to resemble an @entity22 's study as part of a new initiative launched this year to send more state pupils from the area to @entity10 and @entity27			1
spot the difference : the replica at @entity13 ( left ) bears more than a passing resemblance to a real @entity10 don 's study area ( right ) inspiring : the make - over is part of an initiative to send more state pupils to top universities lecturers from @entity10 ’s @entity38 and leading local universities , including @entity14 , will travel to @entity13 to hold lectures and tutorials with @entity43 students			1
they will also coach them in the daunting admission process			2
college principal @entity48 , herself an @entity10 graduate , said that for too long elite universities had recruited disproportionately from private schools			1
she said : ' as someone totally committed to the furthering of academic skills and a love of learning , i am so pleased that we have been chosen			0
' ms @entity48 added : ' i think we are doing something really quite special here			0
' @entity38 tutors , including dr @entity61 ( pictured ) , will hold lectures at the college the idea that @entity66 surroundings may help to inspire pupils from poorer backgrounds is nothing new			1
in 2012 , @entity70 in @entity71 spent £ 10,000 building a room based on that of an @entity10 don in order to put students at ease during the interview process			1
a-level students at the college found themselves surrounded by leather bound books in the room , and elaborate statues were placed outside the windows to mimic top universities ' ornate gardens			1
the @entity88 scheme was another partnership with @entity38 and has seen a number of tutors hold seminars designed to increase pupils understanding of what to expect at a top university			2
headmaster of @entity70 , @entity97 , said : ' if you go to @entity10 it is a daunting experience			2
but if our students have already done it , they will be much more able to cope without being thrown by the unfamiliar surroundings			0
' the pupils here really like it and are wowed every time they step inside because it ’s something different to what they usually see , especially with all the books around the room and the cosy atmosphere			0
' the room is also used for teaching , with tutors from @entity38 college holding seminars			0
students can apply for @entity120 and summer schools to help with @entity10 interviews , and visit the university to get used to the environment			0
calming : in 2012 , @entity70 in @entity71 spent £ 10,000 building a room based on that of an @entity10 don in order to put students at ease during the interview process			1
the @entity88 scheme also saw tutors from @entity38 hold seminars designed to increase pupils understanding of what to expect at a top university			2
preparation : at @entity88 , elaborate statues were placed outside the windows to mimic the ornate gardens found at many top universities the real deal : it is hoped the room , part of a project with @entity38 , @entity10 , will encourage more students from disadvantaged backgrounds to apply for the world famous university mr @entity97 added : ' one or two of our pupils go to @entity10 every year for interviews			1
last year , one attended @entity10 and another went to @entity27			0
' we spoke to former pupils who had been intimidated by going to the @entity157 interviews and they helped us with the design			0
' in total , including the building work , the whole project cost about £ 10,000 but we think it ’s worth it			0
' figures from @entity165 reveal 319 students went to university in 2011 , with 75 per cent of them the first in their family to do so .			0

@entity13 's @entity157 make - over designed to inspire pupils
the college wants to raise number of pupils heading to top universities
lecturers from @entity10 will coach pupils on the daunting interview process
