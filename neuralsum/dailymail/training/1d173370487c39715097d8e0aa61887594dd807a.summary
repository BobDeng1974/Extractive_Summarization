sentence : @entity4 , pictured earlier this month , begged to avoid prison for the sake of her adopted child @entity4 added that detectives were under pressure from @entity47 to pursue the inquiry , and that the operation was a waste of resources that should be spent fighting terrorism			2
during the trial , mr @entity37 said he wrote an email to two colleagues after the call stating that a ‘ senior policewoman ’ wanted to ‘ sell inside information ’			0
@entity4 tearfully denied asking for money , and said she had been angry at resources being taken away from battling terrorism on the anniversary of the september 11 attacks			2

@entity105 , @entity106 , defending , had asked the judge to suspend the sentence , arguing that what she had done did not amount to a ‘ breach in relation to counter terrorism ’ or ‘ a breach in relation to hacking ’			2

’ but the judge said that such a phone call ‘ was a truly dire step for a police officer to take ’			0
