by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 19 april 2013 a former sunbed addict has issued a terrifying warning after it was revealed that more men than ever are dying of skin cancer			1
@entity5 , 49 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , had ignored the signs for two years before being diagnosed after his partner nagged him into seeing his gp			1
he needed life saving surgery to remove a tumour the size of a golf ball from his face after contracting the deadly disease			1
he will remain scarred for life despite skin grafts from his thigh to rebuild the hole left in his temple			2
@entity23 addict @entity5 had a golf ball - sized tumour removed from his forehead after developing skin cancer self - confessed sunbed addict @entity5 is now calling for greater restrictions as new figures from @entity30 reveal more men than women are dying from the disease			1
while more women continue to be diagnosed , the charity believes more men are dying because , like @entity5 , they are less likely to report symptoms to their gp			1
nursing assistant @entity5 said : ‘ i knew about the risks but i ’d been using them for so long with no problems i thought i was safe			1
‘ to be honest , i was addicted to having a year round tan and just assumed it would n’t happen to me			2
i hate going to the doctor and did n’t want to make a fuss so when i first noticed a scab i just ignored it until it disappeared			0
' it was only when my partner got really cross and demanded i see the gp that i finally went			0
i wish i had gone earlier			0
' recent research has shown that the risks of using sunbeds are far higher than previously thought			2
unhealthy glow : @entity5 says he loved having a tan and used sunbeds several times a week scientists at the @entity59 recently revealed that sunbeds are twice as likely to cause skin cancer than a holiday in the @entity63 sun. the @entity64 states sunbeds are as lethal as cigarettes and list them as one of the most dangerous cancer causing habits			1
the government banned them for use by under - 18s last year			0
but thousands of brits like @entity5 continue to risk their lives for a tan			1
he said : ' i started using sun beds to get a bit of a tan before a holiday so i looked good on the beach and stop me burning			2
‘ then when i got back from my holidays i kept using them so my tan did n’t fade			2
i looked healthier and felt good			0
soon it become a habit			0
’ he went from using sunbeds once a week to four times a week for the then maximum permitted 12 minutes			1
‘ i only had one holiday a year but liked the way i looked and felt with a tan so kept using the sunbeds all year round			1
@entity5 's girlfriend @entity93 was attracted to him because of his tan , but soon became worried about his excessive sunbed use after being diagnosed with skin cancer , he had a golf ball - sized tumour removed from his forehead and a skin graft taken from his thigh ( right ) ‘ back then not much was said about using them but even when they started warning people i took no notice , because i did n’t think it would happen to me ‘ to be honest i did n’t want to look pasty white all year			1
if i looked healthy and tanned on the outside i felt good on the inside			2
’ @entity5 admits he became addicted to tanning sessions and was regularly complimented on his deep glow			1
when i went on holiday i never burned and people were always telling me i looked young and fit for my age			0
why would i stop ? ' i ’m a modern man so using the sunbed never bothered me			0
as the years passed i started to notice more men at the salon than women			1
i think men started to take more care of how they looked			2
’ in fact it was his healthy looking tan that first attracted girlfriend @entity126			1
the couple met on a dating website in 2011			0
@entity93 said : ‘ i liked @entity5 ’s profile picture because he looked so fit and well and i suppose part of that was his tan			1
’ but the beautician was shocked to find out his glow was down to sunbeds			2
@entity93 repeatedly begged @entity5 to get his mole seen to , but he refused			1
when she found blood on the pillow , she insisted he get checked out ‘ he was quite open about using the sunbed but it was the frequency that really worried me			0
‘ he was at the tanning shop at least four or five times a week			1
my job means i know how bad it is for your skin and i tried to warn him but @entity5 just laughed			1
‘ like many men he thought he was immune to the risks and had been using for so long he hated the way he looked when he was n’t tanned			2
‘ i told him to use a fake tan but he was n’t interested and just carried on			2
’ but months before the couple met @entity5 had noticed a blemish on his right temple			1
‘ it kept appearing and fading away so i never gave it much thought , ’ he explains			0
but these were the vital first warning signs of @entity160 ( @entity160 )			0
over the following months the blemish began to scab and @entity93 nagged him to see a doctor but @entity5 refused			1
‘ i felt great and i did n’t want to make a fuss and waste time over nothing			0
beside the scab would fall off and everyone would forget about it			0
’ undeterred , @entity5 kept using the sunbed			1
then last year @entity93 started finding blood on the pillow and once again nagged @entity5 to see a doctor about the scab			1
once again he tried to avoid his gp by turning to the internet where he self diagnosed a harmless skin condition			2
regrets : @entity5 now wishes he had never used sunbeds and hopes his story will deter other people he said : ‘ the pictures looked the same so i told @entity93 i knew what it was and not to worry			1
i was sure if i had skin cancer i would n’t have felt so well			1
’ in september 2012 the couple holidayed in @entity187 where @entity5 ’s tan gave him confidence on the beach			1
but the scab was growing and clearly visible in their holiday snaps on their return			0
this time @entity93 insisted @entity5 see a doctor			2
the following month in october 2012 he was referred to a dermatologist who took one look and asked @entity5 if he used sunbeds			1
‘ i knew straight away it was bad news			0
i could n’t believe what a fool i had been , ' he said			0
the consultant suspected skin cancer and arranged a biopsy			1
a month later , the devastating news was confirmed			0
@entity160 is one of the most frequently occurring types of skin cancer and usually associated with exposure to uv light			1
@entity5 said : ‘ it does n’t normally spread but i had left it for so long without seeing a doctor that it did n’t look good at all			2
’ he was admitted for surgery in january this year			0
‘ when i came round i was told the cancer had spread even more than they had expected			0
it was right down to the bone			0
i nearly lost an eye and ear			1
‘ i was shocked when i saw the size of the hole left behind			0
it looked like a crater left by a golf ball			0
‘ they ’ve done a great job with the skin graft but i ’ll still be scarred for life			0
i ’m just lucky to be alive			0
‘ it goes without saying that i wish i had never started using sun beds and i will never use them again			0
‘ my fear is that despite the warnings people still want to look like the cast of @entity238 and will keep using sunbeds to get a tan			2
‘ men ca n’t use fake tan because it ’s messy and gets stuck in your stubble			2
the sunbeds are an easy option			0
‘ tougher regulations would help but it might be easier just to ban them all together			0
‘ in my experience it seems to be the men still using them and men hate going to the doctor so are perhaps more at risk			0
‘ i hope my story stops even one person from using the sunbed			0

@entity5 , 49 , used sunbeds several times a week for many years

began showing signs of skin cancer two years *ago* but ignored them
