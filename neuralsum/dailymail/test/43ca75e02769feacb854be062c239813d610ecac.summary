a furious landowner was forced to fork out thousands of pounds to restore a public path to one of @entity4 's most popular beauty spots			2
@entity5 stumped up £ 15,000 to bring an end to a three year stand - off with @entity8 over who was responsible for the coastal path down to the beach at @entity12 on @entity14 's @entity13			1
the previous steps that lead down to the popular tourist attraction were washed away in storms in 2012			1
@entity5 has stumped up £ 15,000 to end a three - year stand - off with @entity8 over access to @entity12 beach since then visitors have faced a perilous scramble down a crumbling cliff to reach the shore , even resorting to sliding down on their backsides			1
the iconic rock archway and neighbouring @entity28 are part of the @entity31 's 12,000 - acre @entity28 estate			2
the family have maintained the steps since they first bought the land in the 1600s			0
but in 2009 , @entity8 was handed responsibility for the country 's coastal paths under the @entity39			1
the government also announced a 630 - mile path along the south west coast which was to be opened in time for the @entity43			0
however , mr @entity5 says that @entity8 ' shirked ' its duty to reinstate the steps under the law for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path			1
calling the long - running dispute ' laughable and ludicrous ' , he also accused the organisation of ignoring advice given to them on how to manage tourist hotspots like the @entity55			0
the steps to access the iconic rock archway on the @entity58 had been washed away during storms in 2012 @entity8 said they were happy the steps had been reopened but declined to comment on mr @entity5 's claims			1
the estate took the decision to rebuild the 88 steps themselves after becoming ' utterly fed - up with the bureaucracy ' , mr @entity5 said			1
mr @entity5 , a chartered surveyor , said : ' for quite a number of decades now people have visited our coasts and beaches quite freely			0
' about 20 or so years ago we decided to put in steps leading down to the beaches so they did n't have to scramble down the cliffs to get to them			2
in 2009 the @entity39 came along and we had lots of meetings with @entity8 about managing ' honeypot ' sites like @entity82			1
' we had assurances from them that they would n't interfere with the @entity55 because they were happy with the way we were running things			0
' then they announced their big idea , which was to open a 630 - mile path along the south west coast in time for the @entity43 - a path that had already existed for about 40 years - and duly spent a vast amount of money on it			0
the washed - away steps meant visitors were left to scramble up and down the dangerous crumbling cliffs to try and access the beach the government body had been granted responsibility for the country 's coastal paths under the @entity39 2009 ' you can understand the idiocy of this plan			1
our view was that if the coast path was now a public right of way under the @entity39 and controlled by @entity8 then @entity8 should pay for it			1
' one would have thought that would have been the logical answer but @entity8 disagreed			0
' their response was that they were giving the public access to beaches but not the means to actually do it			0
' in 2012 the steps down to @entity12 were washed away in the heavy spring weather we had			2
it was clear the steps needed replacing but @entity8 said they were n't responsible for them			2
' we got to a stand - off with @entity8 - we wanted them to accept their responsibility while they were saying ' it 's nothing to do with us '			1
' about six months ago we got utterly fed up with all the bureaucracy and took the decision to get on with it and pay for the steps ourselves			0
' the cost was about £ 15,000 - not a huge amount of money for a huge @entity139 body like @entity8 but a lot for us			1
mr @entity5 says @entity8 ' shirked ' its duty for three years by claiming they did not form part of the coastal path , leaving him to pay the £ 15,000 to rebuild the steps which have now been reopened ( pictured ) ' we have a very good relationship with @entity8 in all other areas but with coastal access they have ignored all the advice right from the beginning about managing honeypot sites			1
' the whole thing has been laughable and ludicrous and i 've lost patience with it			0
' in the end , regardless of who was officially responsible or the cost , we felt the need to step in to put @entity12 back on the map for walkers and sightseers , and to help minimise the environmental impact to this extraordinary coastal feature			2
' @entity12 is a national icon as well as one of @entity14 's icons so we 're delighted to be able to reopen it , but it 's sad it 's taken so long			0
' the £ 15,000 will add to the £ 40,000 the @entity55 currently spends each year maintaining paths on its land			1
a spokesman for @entity8 said : ' it 's good news that the @entity12 beach steps have been reopened and that local visitors can have safe access to the beach to enjoy this wonderful stretch of the @entity182 coast			1
' we 're not going to be responding to those remarks made by mr @entity5			0
' @entity184 , a direct ancestor of @entity5 , bought @entity185 and its sprawling estate in 1641 from politician @entity187 , 3rd @entity188			0
the @entity190 estate owns around five miles of the @entity13 , a @entity191 , which includes @entity12 and @entity28 @entity8 said it was glad @entity12 's beach steps have been reopened but would not comment on the landowner 's claims it has remained in the @entity31 ever since			1
it was gutted by fire in 1929 and only fully restored in the 1990s by the @entity190 estate and @entity198			0
the estate owns around five miles of the @entity13 , a @entity191 , which includes @entity12 and @entity28			0
the two beauty spots attract more than 500,000 visitors a year			0
agriculture plays a large part in the estate , and it still produces 25 million litres of milk a year , much of which is sold to @entity207			0
in 2013 natural @entity8 said claims made by @entity55 owner @entity5 that the 2009 @entity39 handed them responsibility for the steps to @entity12 were untrue			1
a @entity8 spokesman said in 2013 : ' contrary to mr @entity5 's statement , the legislation does not take land away from landowners or interfere with their freedom to manage it			2
' @entity12 beach still belongs to the @entity55 and is managed alongside the estate 's nearby holiday park , generating revenue from visitors to the park and more widely			2
' the estate has always maintained the steps down on to the beach and remains able to do so now			0

@entity5 had to stump up £ 15,000 to restore steps to the beach at @entity12 which were washed away in 2012
decision ends a three - year stand - off with @entity8 over who was responsible for access to tourist attraction
in 2009 , @entity8 was handed responsibility for the country 's coastal paths under the @entity39
but the government body claimed steps were n't part of coastal route and refused to pay for repairs for three years
