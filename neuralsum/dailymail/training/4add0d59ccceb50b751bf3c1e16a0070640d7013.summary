' as a family , we try to help him by sending money for food and medicine			2
' but it 's not all bad news for @entity6 , whose family say that he is back to good health at home in @entity27 after more than a year surviving on fish , rainwater and his urine aboard a 24 - foot boat			1
he is pictured last april he is even talking about going fishing again , @entity15 said			0
he is also collaborating on a book - and perhaps a documentary - but his former attorney and family friend , @entity42 , is not happy at being left out of the deal , @entity14 reported			0
the duo had a falling out and the attorney now represents the family of @entity48 , 24 , who died of hunger and thirst weeks after he and @entity6 were thrown off course by bad weather			1
@entity42 said the @entity51 believe they are entitled to profits from @entity6 's story - even though they are skeptical about his tale			1
he told authorities that the fish and turtles they caught to eat did not agree with @entity48 's stomach and he died			1
he denied eating his friend and says he threw the man 's body overboard			0
' they do n't think their son died the way @entity6 says he did , ' @entity42 told @entity14			2
@entity42 has also filed a $ 1 million breach of contract suit against @entity6 after he says the former fisherman dropped him for a @entity69 - based law firm			2
incredible : he is pictured , left , after he came to shore on the @entity5 last january			2
his companion , @entity48 , 24 , ( right ) died four months after they became lost at sea , he said vessel : he drifted on his 24 - foot boat for 13 months , surviving on raw fish , birds , turtles and rainwater ' we would have been very successful together , ' he said			1
' @entity6 's story is worth a lot of money			1
' his new lawyer , @entity84 , said a publisher has bought @entity6 's story			1
it will be written by @entity88 journalist @entity87 , who wrote ' 33 men ' about the @entity91 miners trapped underground for 69 days in 2010 , @entity14 reported			0
@entity6 and @entity48 vanished in november 2012 after they headed out to hunt sharks in @entity94			1
they were hit by a storm and swept out to sea			0
five days after @entity48 failed to return , his family in @entity100 reported him missing and began searching for him , his aunt @entity98 said			2
' our family looked for him in the sea , in other villages , always hoping to find him , ' she said - but their search ended about three weeks later in december 2012			0
astonishing feat : thirteen months after heading out on a shark hunting trip from @entity94 , he came ashore on the @entity5 , which are about 5,500 miles from where he set off back home : he is pictured arriving back home with relatives after being found in january 2014 thirteen months later , on january 30 , 2014 , a bearded and bedraggled @entity6 was rescued and told an astonishing tale of how he survived by eating raw fish , turtles and birds			1
' i always had faith that i was going to survive , asking ( @entity119 ) every day and every night , ' he told the media after he landed back home			0
' i never lost faith that one day i would be found			0
' there was skepticism about his story after doctors deemed @entity6 to be in strikingly good health , although he was mentally frail , dehydrated and limping			1
but he stood by his story and survival experts and oceanographers said it was possible			0
months after setting foot on land again , he passed a lie detector test			0
' i think he is doing fine , ' his new attorney told @entity14			0
' he 's very , very grateful to be alive			0

@entity6 , 38 , reached the @entity5 on january 30 last year , 13 months after he was caught up in a storm as he hunted for sharks
he survived on fish , birds and rainwater but his friend , @entity48 , 24 , died four months into the trip because the food made him sick
@entity48 's family doubt @entity6 's *version* of events and say they are entitled to a cut of his profits ; a publisher has bought his story
@entity6 is *relying* on family *handouts* and is being sued by his former lawyer for breach of contract ' for *ditching* him for another lawyer '
but his family says he is in good health and is talking about fishing again
