@entity0 came from behind to see off @entity1 in a friendly at the @entity1 , with goals from @entity4 , @entity5 , and @entity6			1
@entity1 had taken the lead through a @entity9 header , and looked to be in total control before @entity13 star @entity4 's well - worked equaliser , but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half , and could have scored more as the game wore on			1
@entity17 's @entity5 who already had 42 goals for his country before this game , made it 43 , firing past @entity22 from an angle which will have disappointed the @entity25 keeper , before @entity26 defensive midfielder @entity6 was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner			2
@entity9 gets up highest to head @entity1 into the lead , after @entity32 had slipped and @entity33 had blocked @entity34 the @entity36 defender celebrates his goal , as @entity1 went ahead against @entity0 in the @entity1 @entity13 midfielder @entity4 shows his delight after levelling the scores shortly before half time with a well - taken finish @entity5 fires home from a tight angle , beating @entity22 with a powerful effort at his near post , to put @entity0 ahead @entity6 celebrates making it 3 - 1 , after he was able to rise unchallenged and power home a header from a corner @entity1 : @entity22 6.5 , @entity51 5.5 , @entity9 6 , @entity52 6 , @entity33 6 , @entity53 6 ( @entity54 84 mins ) , @entity55 6.5 , @entity56 6 ( @entity57 74 ) , @entity58 6.5 ( @entity59 74 ) , @entity60 4.5 , @entity61 7 ( @entity62 82 ) subs not used : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			1
goal : @entity9 21 @entity0 : @entity73 6.5 , @entity32 6.5 , @entity34 6.5 , @entity74 7 , @entity6 6.5 , @entity75 6.5 ( @entity76 90 ) , @entity77 6.5 ( @entity78 92 ) , @entity4 7 ( @entity79 86 ) , @entity5 7 , @entity80 7.5 ( @entity81 83 ) , @entity82 6 ( @entity83 88 ) subs not used : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91			1
goals : @entity4 40 , @entity5 57 , @entity6 69 referee : @entity94 ( @entity95 ) @entity1 , on the other hand , threatened most from set pieces , and @entity60 , @entity56 and @entity9 could easily have added further goals for the hosts , as @entity0 looked panicky whenever a decent cross arrived in their box			1
as tends to be the way with such friendlies , there was no great intensity to the play , but , in flashes there was real quality , and @entity4 's equaliser epitomised that			0
the @entity13 man , operating from the left , played a lovely one - two with @entity115 before arriving fractions ahead of a defender to poke past @entity22			0
you might say it was a goal worthy of a @entity121 final , but , 17 years after these two sides contested one on the same ground , it had to make do with turning the tide in a friendly			0
@entity1 had actually started the brighter , and should have been ahead after just eight minutes , @entity60 denied by a brilliant save from @entity73 , but he really should have scored his header from three yards			2
@entity0 , with @entity128 target @entity82 playing up front alongside talismanic captain @entity5 , failed to find their best play early on , limited for the most part to long shots			2
@entity115 in particular was keen to get a strike away from range , but while he twice worked @entity22 with powerful drives , neither could seriously have been said to overstretch the @entity138 stopper			0
indeed , while @entity22 made several flashy saves throughout the game , denying @entity6 , @entity80 and @entity4 in the second half , he was rarely able to stop efforts that came from within his side 's eighteen - yard box			0
@entity5 , oscillating between the subtle touches we are used to seeing from him and a clear inability to cope with the slippery surface , should really have been the first to fire past the @entity1 keeper , after @entity4 had capitalised on a mistake from @entity55 , but having squared up @entity9 , his shot lacked power and direction			2
@entity5 , of @entity17 , battles with @entity155 's @entity53 as @entity0 struggled to find their best play in a tight first half @entity160 star @entity55 , operating at the base of the @entity1 midfield , holds of @entity6 of @entity13 and @entity77 @entity4 gets a shot away in front of @entity55 , but for the most part @entity0 were limited to efforts from range , without breaking @entity1 down @entity166 , whose corner led to @entity1 's opening goal , takes on @entity13 left back @entity6 during the friendly match just moments later he was punished for his wastefulness , with @entity9 powering home a header that sparked comparison 's to @entity175 's goal in the 1998 final			1
in truth it owed much to @entity33 blocking off defenders , and the majority of the @entity181 standing still as @entity61 's corner came over , but the @entity36 centre back still did well to direct his header into the far corner			1
but @entity1 were never able to fully capitalise on @entity181 frailties again , @entity9 failing to poke home after a free kick , and @entity60 blazing over the bar			0
debutant @entity189 came closest from open play after coming off the bench , but sent his shot just wide			0
@entity73 , who had earlier made a good save from @entity60 following another set piece , can not stop @entity9 's header finding the corner despite having plenty of defenders in the box , @entity0 were unable to stop @entity9 getting a clean header on the ball to open the scoring as the almost obligatory substitutions poured off the bench the game lost momentum , but for @entity207 , there were real signs of encouragement			2
@entity0 were always dangerous on the counter attack , with @entity80 a particular danger , and , set pieces aside , they looked solid defensively			0
this was not the free flowing football that @entity181 sides are famed for , but , for the second time under @entity207 , @entity0 look tough to beat			0
@entity61 ( right ) , @entity218 , @entity52 and @entity219 ( left ) for his headed goal @entity5 struggled to make an impact on the game in the early stages , losing his footing and finding himself crowded out regularly @entity60 shouts to the heavens after missing another glorious opportunity for @entity1 , as @entity0 came back to win the game @entity189 gets a shot away after coming off the bench to make his @entity1 debut , but the hosts failed to break down @entity0 the @entity1 team observed a minute 's silence for the people who died in the @entity236 plane crash earlier this week			1

@entity36 centre back @entity9 powers in a header from a @entity61 corner to give @entity1 the lead
oscar levels before half time , before @entity5 puts @entity0 into the lead after 56 minutes
@entity6 arrives *unmarked* from a corner to make it 3 - 1 with 20 minutes to play
