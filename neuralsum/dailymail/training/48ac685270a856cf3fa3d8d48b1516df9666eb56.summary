@entity0 could become the latest in a short list of impeached @entity3 presidents , according to sen. @entity4 and @entity6 columnist @entity5 the specter of impeachment proceedings against president @entity0 over an alleged @entity10 cover - up has been raised for the first time , with a conservative senator and a liberal political columnist both hinting that ' the " i " word ' could be in play			1
@entity17 @entity16 sen. @entity4 said thursday on the @entity19 radio show that what he called the ' greatest cover - up in @entity3 history ' could soon enter impeachment territory			1
' people may be starting to use the " i " - word before too long , ‚Äù @entity4 said			1
' the i - word meaning impeachment ? ' @entity26 , the host , asked			1
' yeah , ' @entity4 replied			2
during friday 's airing of the @entity37 program now , @entity5 responded to the suggestion that @entity16 ' political knives are out for former secretary of state @entity40 in advance of the 2016 presidential election - by saying that the episode could reach into the @entity44 and snare its current occupant			1
@entity10 hearings , he said , could point to ' that word that starts with " i. " ' ' it becomes a potential impeachment issue , ' @entity5 said , ' as long as the @entity16 are in control of the @entity51			1
' an @entity0 impeachment ? @entity4 ( @entity53 ) and @entity5 ( r ) are suggesting that it could come over the fast - growing @entity10 scandal the impeachment of a sitting president is rare , and would originate with charges brought in the @entity16 - dominated @entity51			1
the @entity59 , however , votes on whether to convict an impeached president			0
that body is currently controlled by @entity62 , and the status of its majority is likely to be a hotly contested issue in the 2014 mid-term election			0
president @entity69 's impeachment was stopped in a @entity62 - controlled senate , which refused to convict him on charges that he lied , while under oath , about his affair with a @entity75 intern			0
@entity30 noted that @entity77 host and former @entity79 gov. @entity78 has predicted that @entity0 ' will not serve out his full term ' because of @entity10 - related accusations			1
@entity82 uncovered 12 versions of the infamous @entity10 talking points , suggesting that the @entity0 administration was more involved with editing them than it has admitted ' this is not good for the @entity75 right now , ' said @entity37 host @entity88 ( c )			2
@entity90 's @entity89 ( r ) agreed that it does n't look good , and @entity5 of @entity6 ( second from @entity91 ) raised ' the " i " word ' @entity82 revealed friday that a set of public talking points on the sept. 11 , 2012 attack on the @entity3 @entity97 in @entity10 , @entity93 was edited 12 times , and ultimately presented a false reading of the terror attack			1
@entity103 personnel had a hand in proposing those revisions , emails leaked to @entity82 show , despite the @entity75 's insistence that its political appointees had no ' substantive ' role in changing the official @entity10 story			0
ultimately @entity114 ambassador @entity113 , then - secretary of state @entity40 , and president @entity0 all referred publicly to the terror attack as the result of a spontaneous protest sparked by an anti-islam @entity118 video			2
' here 's what happened , ' @entity0 told @entity121 on his @entity123 nighttime talk show on sept. 18			0
' you had a video that was released by somebody who lives here , sort of a shadowy character who made an extremely offensive video directed at @entity131 and @entity132 , making fun of the @entity131 , ' the president said			0
' and so this caused great offense in much of the @entity132 world			0
but what also happened , extremists and terrorists used this as an excuse to attack a variety of our embassies , including the one - the consulate in @entity93			0
' that story turned out to be false			0
@entity103 spokeswoman @entity148 's emails show that the agency , then headed by @entity40 , had a direct hand in altering the official story on the @entity10 terror attack then - secretary of state @entity40 testified before @entity153 that it did n't matter whether the @entity10 assault was a terrorist attack or the result of a protest			2
' what difference , at this point , does it make ? ' she asked a @entity75 press briefing scheduled for 12:30 p.m. friday was rescheduled for 1:45 after press secretary @entity162 opted instead to hold a private , off - the - record briefing with 14 journalists			0
the briefing was later rescheduled again , for 3:15 p.m. president @entity0 was scheduled to deliver remarks about the @entity167 in the @entity168 of the @entity75 at 2:40 p.m. the briefing , when it occurs , is likely to see an explosion of new questions about @entity10 , but it will be delayed enough to push the resulting news into what journalists call the ' friday black hole ' - the final hours before the weekend when @entity3 least pay attention to current events .			2
