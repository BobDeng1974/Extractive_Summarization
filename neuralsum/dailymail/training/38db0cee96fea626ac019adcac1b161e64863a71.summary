by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 4 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:05 est , 4 november 2013 fresh sea bass from your local fishmonger , organic vegetables from the grocers and artisan bread from the village bakery is a foodie ’s dream - but who has the time or energy to shop for that ? one new delivery service , which allows users to order food online from a range of local shops and have them delivered to their door in one lot , is hoping to make that concept a reality			1
@entity25 - an @entity27 - style delivery service for local shops - describes itself as a home delivery service on a mission to save the high - street			1
so how does it work ? customers log in to their website and fill up their online basket with goods from participating shops in their local area and @entity25 drivers will collect your order from each shop and deliver it to your door at your chosen time			1
@entity58 , a former human rights lawyer , is the brains behind the business			1
she came up with the idea in 2007 after working such long hours that she was forced to live off convenience food			0
she loved to eat well and had always been passionate about independent shops - but her lifestyle meant that , when it came to where she shopped and what she ate , she could n’t make the choices she wanted to			2
so in 2008 , she spent £ 30,000 of her own money to pilot the concept			0
speaking to @entity71 , she said : ' i kept thinking , if you could have the convenience of an online supermarket but with the quality and integrity of local shops , that would be perfect			2
’ easy peasy : shoppers log on , shop and then choose a delivery time suited to them , with the service costing £ 3.50 @entity25 was officially born in january 2010 and currently delivers 4,000 products from 32 independent shops across 200 postcodes of @entity88			1
local shops such as @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity93 ’s fishmongers in south @entity88 and @entity95 's delicatessen in @entity96 are some of the businesses on board			2
@entity25 promises that its items cost the same as they would in store and @entity58 charges retailers around 50 per cent of their profit on the goods			0
‘ today , @entity25 is a team of 13 food - loving shop - supporting superheroes including two former chefs , a food anthropologist , a development economist , an engineer , a wannabe pop - up restaurateur , two developers with massive brains , and our dashing delivery drivers , ’ writes @entity58 on her website			0
speaking about her customers , @entity118 said they have a higher - than - average income , ' because by definition they are cash - rich and time - poor			1
’ ‘ i do n’t agree with the common assumption that high street shops cost more than the supermarket			0
if you stand outside the @entity127 [ a renowned @entity88 butcher ] you will see people from all walks of life , because butchers sell cuts of meat that you do n’t get in supermarkets , ’ she said			0
and @entity58 is thinking big : she plans to take her foodie brainchild nationwide			0
on board : local shops such as @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity93 's fishmongers in south @entity88 and @entity95 's delicatessen in @entity96 are some of the businesses on board			2
