by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:33 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 8 october 2013 @entity2 thought they had a winning plan they could set out today that would pass a long - term increase of the federal government 's borrowing limit and force @entity8 @entity7 to accept no concessions			1
but then @entity11 director @entity10 let the cat out of the bag			0
asked during a monday morning breakfast event whether the @entity8 might embrace a two - to three - week extension on the nation 's credit card if @entity18 passed it , instead of a longer deal , @entity10 replied that ' longer is better for economic certainty and jobs , but it is ultimately up to them			1
' that sent senate majority leader @entity25 and his cohorts scrambling , reports @entity27 , the northern @entity28 newspaper that hosted the event			0
a short - term deal would free republicans to renegotiate terms in a few weeks ' time , a scenario that @entity34 @entity2 fear would open them up to a new budget stalemate , and to demands for changes to the @entity38 , the president 's signature health insurance overhaul			1
@entity11 director @entity10 said monday that it 's up to @entity18 whether a debt limit fix would be a long - term or a short - term proposition , a message @entity2 did n't want to hear senate majority leader @entity25 hopes to force a long - term debt limit increase through the @entity2 and drop it on @entity44 , forcing them to take a stand on extending the reach of @entity1 's credit card @entity2 had hoped that the @entity8 would walk that assertion back later in the day , but spokesman @entity50 did n't			1
' how @entity18 fulfills it , as long as they fulfill it without drama or delay , without brinksmanship , without threatening default , is up to them , ' @entity50 said monday afternoon , ' and the duration that they attach to it , again , is up to them			2
' ' what our position has always been , ' he added , ' has not been , raise it for a certain amount of time			0
it has been , raise the debt ceiling without drama and delay			0
so whatever the duration , our position will not change			0
' he said what ? senate majority whip @entity71 ( r ) was taken aback by @entity10 's candid comments , and by day 's end the @entity8 did n't do much to clear things up the new position , which seemed to represent the first chink in the @entity79 administration 's high - stakes armor , came as @entity25 and other @entity2 were preparing to force the issue and pass their own long - term increase on the government 's borrowing limit			1
@entity84 is expected to hit the current ceiling on october 17 , and could default on the nation 's $ 16.7 trillion debt if new authority is n't granted to rack up more obligations			2
the @entity2 will likely be the next to act , with @entity25 expected to offer a bill tuesday or wednesday that would authorize a new debt ceiling increase with no strings attached – and for a prolonged period of time			1
republicans there could filibuster that measure , however			0
but that has never been done on a budget measure such as this			0
@entity25 would need to find at least six @entity7 senators willing to support ' cloture , ' a measure that ends debate and forces a formal vote			1
with just 52 democrats on his side , plus two independents who are @entity2 in all but name , the @entity7 has enough power to block him if they remain unified			2
without significant concessions , a senior @entity7 @entity2 aide told @entity113 , that scenario is increasingly likely			1
@entity7 are demanding deep budget cuts to ensure that annual deficits , currently in excess of $ 750 billion , slow down their cumulative effect on the larger debt number over time			2
' really , mr. president ! ' : @entity121 said a @entity8 official told him the president would rather default on @entity1 's debts than negotiate with republicans president @entity79 has kept the pressure on , seemingly dismissing any thought that he might concede ground to @entity7 in exchange for a debt - ceiling hike and @entity8 republicans , led by @entity121 , are still holding out for concessions on @entity38			1
@entity7 house speaker @entity121 ratcheted up the pressure on monday , saying on the @entity8 floor that ' a senior @entity8 official ' told him ' the president would rather default than to sit down and negotiate			1
' ' really ? ' @entity121 asked			0
' the president – i will say this again – a senior @entity8 staffer this morning said that the president would rather default on our debt than to sit down and negotiate			2
now the @entity1 people expect when their leaders have differences , we 're in a time of crisis , that we 'll sit down and at least have a conversation			0
' ' really , mr. president , it 's time to have that conversation before our economy is put further at risk			0
' earlier in the day , the president told employees of the @entity158 that he would n't be pressured to negotiate with @entity121 over the nation 's debt limit while a default was looming			1
sen. @entity162 ( r ) signaled that she might bolt from the @entity7 leadership and side with @entity2 , saying , ' we should n't be dismissing anything out of hand ' any port in a storm : @entity8 press secretary @entity50 said the president just wants the authority to borrow more money , ' whatever the duration ' @entity18 might approve ' we 're not going to establish that pattern , ' @entity79 said , adding that ' we 're not going to negotiate under the threat of ... economic catastrophe			1
' @entity179 vice finance minister @entity178 said monday that the @entity1 must act quickly to ensure the security of more than $ 1 trillion in @entity179 investments in @entity1			0
' the clock is ticking , ' @entity178 warned			0
the @entity8 and its @entity2 allies are hoping a long - term debt limit hike proposal would force the @entity7 's hand if it lands on @entity121 's desk			1
there are signs that some @entity2 @entity7 are more eager to resolve the stalemate than to see a permanent winner declared			2
sen. @entity162 , an @entity191 moderate , told the @entity192 on tuesday that ' we should n't be dismissing anything out of hand , whether it 's the debt ceiling or what we 're going to do with this government shutdown			0
' ' we 've got a situation where you 've got a calendar running , you 've got people who are frustrated and upset , so let 's figure it out			0

@entity2 *blanched* when a top @entity8 economist said it 's up to @entity18 whether a debt limit hike would be short - term or long - term
the administration did nothing monday to support @entity211 allies , who had insisted that only a long - term fix would be *acceptable*
house speaker @entity121 claims a senior administration official told him @entity79 would rather default than negotiate with republicans
@entity25 had planned to force the issue with a debt limit increase bill designed to make the @entity8 @entity7 vote up or down
