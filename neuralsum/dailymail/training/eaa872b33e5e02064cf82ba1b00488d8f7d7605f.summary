@entity44 , 67 , from @entity45 , near @entity46 , said her 94 - year - old mother paid the levy to be able to go on a cruise			2
she added : ‘ they ’re holding people to ransom			0
it ’s disgusting – i do n’t think she should have to pay all that money , but she did it because she would have lost her holiday otherwise			0
