by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 12:29 est , 30 january 2014 our solar system has an unruly past in which giant planets nearly wiped out the asteroid belt and turned it into cosmic ‘ snow globe ’			1
this is according to researchers in @entity10 who claim that the solar system was once a riotous place in which @entity13 may have been as close to the sun as @entity15 is now			1
as the planet moved through the main asteroid belt , they believe it tossed interplanetary flotsam far and wide			1
in this artist 's conception , @entity13 's migration through the solar system has swept asteroids out of stable orbits , sending them careening into one another			2
as the gas giant planets migrated , they stirred the contents of the solar system the researchers noted that objects from as close to the sun as @entity33 and as far out as @entity34 all congregated in the asteroid belt at this time			1
‘ the asteroid belt is a melting pot of objects arriving from diverse locations and backgrounds , ’ said @entity36 , a @entity37 postdoctoral fellow at the @entity38			1
astronomers have long recognised the asteroid belt ’s diversity , but a new analysis of the asteroids within the belt has revealed that it is more diverse than previously thought			1
astronomers have theorised that long - ago asteroid impacts delivered much of the water now filling @entity54 's oceans , as shown in this artist 's conception			1
if true , the stirring provided by migrating planets may have been essential to bringing those asteroids the asteroid belt is a region of space between the orbits of @entity15 and @entity13 where most of the asteroids in our solar system are found			1
traditionally , asteroids were viewed as the pieces of a failed planet that was prevented from forming by the influence of @entity13 's powerful gravity			2
the asteroids in the belt come in a variety of sizes			0
some are very small ( less than a mile across ) , while others are quite large			0
the largest asteroid is called @entity77			0
it is about one - quarter the size of our moon			0
it is a dwarf planet			0
most asteroids in the @entity84 have an orbital period of about three to six @entity54 years			2
the findings have interesting implications for the history of @entity54			2

their compositions seemed to vary methodically from drier to wetter , due to the drop in temperature as you move away from the sun. that traditional view changed as astronomers recognised that the current residents of the main asteroid belt were n't all there from the start			1
in the early history of our solar system the giant planets ran amok , migrating inward and outward substantially			0
using data from the @entity118 , dr @entity36 and co-author @entity119 examined the compositions of thousands of asteroids within the main belt			0
their findings raises a number of questions			0
for instance , will other @entity54 - like exoplanet require a similar pattern of asteroids fall - out to make it habitable ? if so , then @entity54 - like planets may be rarer than first thought .			0

researchers say @entity13 may have been as close to the sun as @entity15 is now
this comes from study of asteroid belt that *suggests* it is *extremely* diverse
as the @entity13 moved through the main asteroid belt , they believe it broke up tossed interplanetary flotsam far and wide
if true , this movement may have been essential to bringing life on @entity54
