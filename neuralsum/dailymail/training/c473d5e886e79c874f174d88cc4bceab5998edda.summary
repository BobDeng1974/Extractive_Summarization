by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 05:26 est , 25 july 2012 disease hub : @entity4 's @entity3 airport is the worst possible place for a traveller infected with a new illness to travel through , according to a new study @entity4 's @entity3 airport is the worst possible place for a traveller infected with a new illness to travel through , according to a new study			1
travelling through @entity3 would mean the largest possible likelikhood of a global epidemic resulting from infected travellers			2
public health crises of the past decade — such as the 2003 @entity17 outbreak , which spread to 37 countries and caused about 1,000 deaths , and the 2009 h1n1 flu pandemic that killed about 300,000 people worldwide — have provided girim reminders hat new viruses or bacteria could spread quickly across the globe , aided by air travel			1
the @entity28 study used mathematical modelling to predict which airports would play the largest role in spreading disease			2
small airports such as @entity34 can play a disproportionately large part - others @entity36 , @entity34 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity40 ( @entity39 ) and @entity41 ( @entity42 )			0
‘ our work is the first to look at the spatial spreading of contagion processes at early times , and to propose a predictor for which ' nodes ' — in this case , airports — will lead to more aggressive spatial spreading , ’ says @entity43 , the @entity44 associate professor in @entity45 in @entity46			0
‘ the findings could form the basis for an initial evaluation of vaccine allocation strategies in the event of an outbreak , and could inform national security agencies of the most vulnerable pathways for biological attacks in a densely connected world			0
’ spreading the sickness : police officers wear masks at @entity69 , as a precautionary measure against influenza a ( @entity71 ) , commonly referred to as swine flu in 2009 @entity3 2 @entity36 , @entity36 3			2
@entity38 , @entity40 ( @entity39 ) but a new study by researchers in @entity28 's @entity75 ( @entity46 ) shifts the focus to the first few days of an epidemic , determining how likely the 40 largest @entity79 airports are to influence the spread of a contagious disease originating in their home cities			1
this new approach could help determine appropriate measures for containing infection in specific geographic areas and aid public health officials in making decisions about the distribution of vaccinations or treatments in the earliest days of @entity102 existing models , the new @entity28 model incorporates variations in travel patterns among individuals , the geographic locations of airports , the disparity in interactions among airports , and waiting times at individual airports to create a tool that could be used to predict where and how fast a disease might spread			1
existing models typically assume a random , homogenous diffusion of travelers from one airport to the @entity113 , people do n't travel randomly ; they tend to create patterns that can be replicated			0
using @entity117 's work on human mobility patterns , @entity119 and his research group — including graduate student @entity121 and research associate @entity122 — applied @entity124 simulations to determine the likelihood of any single traveler flying from one airport to another			0
spreaders of disease : the new study looked at which of 40 @entity79 home airports would have the worst impact on spreading disease ‘ the results from our model are very different from those of a conventional model that relies on the random diffusion of travelers … [ and ] similar to the advective flow of fluids , ’ says @entity121 , first author of a paper by the four @entity28 researchers that was published in the journal @entity136			1
‘ the advective transport process relies on distinctive properties of the substance that 's moving , as opposed to diffusion , which assumes a random flow			0
if you include diffusion only in the model , the biggest airport hubs in terms of traffic would be the most influential spreaders of disease			2
but that 's not accurate			0
’ for example , a simplified model using random diffusion might say that half the travelers at the @entity34 airport will go to @entity37 and half to @entity166 , @entity167 , taking the disease and spreading it to travelers at those airports , who would randomly travel and continue the @entity172 fact , while the @entity34 airport gets only 30 percent as much air traffic as @entity4 's @entity175 , the new model predicts that it is nearly as influential in terms of contagion , because of where it fits in the air transportation network : its location in the @entity184 and its many connections to distant , large and well - connected hubs gives it a ranking of third in terms of contagion - spreading influence .			1

@entity4 's @entity3 ranks first out of 40 @entity79 airports

could help contain next @entity71 or @entity17 outbreak
