chatting happily and smiling during a peaceful walk in the grounds of their @entity4 country home , they could be any long - married couple enjoying a stroll			1
but this is the @entity9 and the @entity10 and the intimate shot marks not 40 years of marriage but 10			1
the couple , who married a decade ago at the @entity14 , are spending their anniversary privately at @entity17 in @entity18			1
the new image , which is the work of top photographer @entity40 , was taken in the run - up to last month 's visit to the @entity43 but was released by @entity44 today			1
in it , @entity22 wears a country coat made from @entity47 and a matching hat by @entity49 , while @entity23 sports a hat by the same firm and a coat by @entity53			1
@entity22 and @entity23 finally married following a relationship spanning 35 years in a relatively quiet civil ceremony at the @entity14 on the 9th april 2005			1
despite fears that the couple would be booed - @entity23 was reportedly so nervous that she had to be dragged out of bed - the ceremony went off without a hitch			1
since then , the @entity10 as she is now known , has become an integral part of the @entity63 - and would be cheerfully accepted as @entity22 ' queen by 50 per cent of @entity65			1
that marks a significant turnaround from the @entity68 ' earliest days as a royal , with @entity23 following @entity22 ' lead and often appearing nervous in front of photographers			1
but her enthusiastic championing of causes ranging from osteoporosis to sexual abuse survivors has not gone unnoticed and her relationship with the @entity32 is now said to be close			1
' her role has changed dramatically , ' explains royal biographer @entity79			0
' one minute she was a mistress and then she was an @entity80			0
' when she first married @entity22 she was very nervous			0
on her wedding day , she was terrified			0
she had no idea if she would be booed in the street			0
' in fact , there was a very warm reception			0
the streets were packed in @entity14			0
she has slowly gained courage and confidence			0
initially she was very much in the background , supporting the @entity9 and she still does that			0
' she 's never had any ambition for herself			2
she did n't want to be a princess or a duchess			0
she just happened to love a man who was the @entity9 and look at the fuss that caused			0
she does n't want to be a star or be curtseyed to			0
happy : the pair are all smiles as they arrive at the @entity65 ambassador 's residence in @entity104 last month cheers ! @entity22 and @entity23 pictured enjoying a dram during a visit to @entity17 last summer ' but slowly , slowly she has become much more involved in royal life and taken on an awful lot of charitable causes			1
' @entity111 is now patron or president of 85 charities , joint patron or president with the prince of four , and is affiliated to a number of other organisations			0
ms @entity79 added : ' it 's really , really valued by those charities			2
having been a woman who up to her mid- 50s had been a wife and a mother and a country woman who enjoyed horses and dogs , she 's completely reinvented herself and become an ambassador for the country			2
' in 2013 , @entity23 made her first ever appearance at the @entity130 wearing a glamorous champagne silk and lace @entity133 gown			1
@entity111 , whose presence was seen as a boost for @entity22 , topped that with the @entity140 's priceless @entity139 tiara and the @entity141 of the @entity143 sash			2
she returned for the 2014 state opening as well and is expected to return once again for this year 's event			0
close : prince @entity146 and the @entity10 share a joke during last september 's @entity148 support : the @entity32 shares a carriage with @entity23 during the @entity152 celebrations in 2012 one is amused : @entity23 laughs with prince @entity153 and the @entity10 during the @entity152 similarly styled : the @entity10 ' dress sense has also evolved over the last 10 years and is much like her daughter - in - law 's @entity111 has also carried out joint engagements with the @entity32 and in november hosted a reception on behalf of the monarch for the @entity160 competition			1
during the @entity152 in 2012 , the @entity32 and @entity23 sat side - by - side in the ornate 1902 state landau - a step that would have been inconceivable a decade earlier			1
the @entity164 had fallen ill and the @entity9 and @entity23 stepped in to ride with the monarch in the carriage procession back to @entity167			2
but it was @entity23 , not @entity22 who was seated next to the @entity32			1
she was present too on stage , standing next to the sovereign , as @entity22 paid tribute to his mother at the finale of a pop concert in front of the @entity167			0
during the @entity179 concert in 2002 , prior to her marriage to the @entity9 , @entity23 was seated several rows behind @entity22			2
on @entity22 and @entity23 's seventh wedding anniversary in 2012 , the @entity32 made the @entity10 a @entity182 ( @entity182 ) - a personal seal of approval from the monarch			1
' i do n't think that the @entity32 has ever had any personal animosity to @entity23			1
in the @entity188 and @entity189 when @entity22 and @entity190 were at each other 's throats , @entity23 was seen to be the cause and it threatened to destabilise the monarchy , ' says ms @entity79			1
' @entity196 has always been fond of @entity23			2
she knew her for years and years , long before she was involved in the break up of the marriage			0
' she added : ' the queen reacts to public opinion			0
once the public were going to accept @entity23 , the @entity32 was able to accept her publicly			1
' they 've got a great deal in common			0
they 're mad about horses , dogs			0
' when @entity23 married @entity22 , aides insisted she did not want to be known as queen when the @entity9 acceded to the throne but intended to be known as princess consort instead			2
but according to some legal experts , unless there is change in the law , @entity23 will technically become queen when @entity22 is king - no matter what she decides to call herself			2
at the time of her engagement to the @entity9 in 2005 , a poll showed that only seven per cent of people believed @entity23 should one day be queen			2
happily married : @entity22 has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since his marriage close : @entity111 has always known how to make @entity22 laugh and he ' adores her ' in return royal duties : with half of @entity65 supporting the idea , it is increasingly likely that @entity23 will become queen a decade later , half of all @entity65 say she should become queen when @entity22 takes the throne according to a poll by @entity236			1
a third think she should be given a lesser title out of sensitivity to @entity190 , @entity240 and 16 per cent were unsure			0
when the @entity9 was put on the spot and asked if @entity23 would be his queen in an interview in november 2010 , he replied : ' that 's , that 's , we 'll see , wo n't we ? that could be			1
' ' i think there 's still a hard core of people out there who want nothing to do with @entity23 and think she 's the devil incarnate but the vast majority think she 's a good thing , ' adds ms @entity79			1
' she is familiar now as any member of the @entity63			0
it would be very strange if she were not called queen			0
' i think she will be embraced and think the public will have no problem with it whatsoever			0
@entity22 is hugely proud of her and she 's so important to him			0
he wants her by his side - that 's an absolute given			0
' born @entity23 on the 17th july 1947 , the @entity10 's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones			1
the daughter of @entity268 and his wife @entity269 , the @entity10 was born in @entity270 but spent much of her childhood in @entity272 along with her siblings , @entity274 and @entity275			2
according to her biographer @entity276 , her upbringing , although not royal , was certainly a grand one			0
' @entity23 is often described as having had an " @entity280 sort of @entity281 " , ' he writes			2
' in fact , it was much grander than that			0
' the @entity286 had position and they had help – help in the house , help in the garden , help with children			0
they opened their garden for the local @entity296 summer fête			0
' after a stint at a @entity299 finishing school , @entity23 burst onto the @entity270 social scene as a debutante on the 25th march 1965			2
but it was n't all fun , with the future @entity10 working as a secretary for a succession of @entity270 firms to pay for her @entity308 flat , which she shared with lady @entity310			2
in the late 1960s , @entity23 met the man who was to become her first husband , cavalry officer @entity312 , with the couple dating off and on for several years - with mr @entity312 striking up a relationship with princess @entity315 at one point			1
@entity23 , meanwhile , had struck up a relationship with prince @entity22 , who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971			1
when the couple split following an overseas posting for @entity22 in 1973 , @entity23 reconciled with @entity312 and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year			1
@entity324 in 1974 and @entity325 in 1978			0
but it was her continuing relationship with prince @entity22 that would come to define her , with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people			1
in 1992 , claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when @entity190 : her @entity335 was published , followed , a year later by the ' @entity337 ' scandal			0
by 1995 , both marriages had come to an end and @entity22 and @entity23 were unofficially back together , with the future duchess often seen attending events with the prince			2
royal acceptance soon followed with the @entity32 making @entity23 part of the @entity179 celebrations in 2002			1
a year later , the @entity68 moved into @entity44 and on the 10th february 2005 , @entity22 and @entity23 's engagement was announced			1
the couple married just under two months later in @entity14 , with @entity23 taking the title of the @entity10 .			1

@entity44 has released a new photo to mark 10th anniversary
the snap was taken last month at the couple 's @entity4 home , @entity17
@entity23 became the @entity10 a decade ago
since then , she has become an increasingly popular figure
@entity23 also enjoys a close relationship with the @entity32 and her *stepsons*
