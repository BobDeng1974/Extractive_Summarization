white picket fences : things were far from perfect at this home on a quiet suburban street , where @entity21 held his sister against her will for years no sightings : the window to the room where the 56 - year - old woman lived was blacked out so neighbors could n't see in the tiny bedroom - its sole window painted black , nailed shut with boards and locked tight from the outside - was ' kept like a dungeon , ' he said in the news release distributed after @entity21 ’s arrest			1
