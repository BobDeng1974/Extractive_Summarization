@entity0 failed to show at a press conference to promote his fight with @entity3 , provoking anger from his opponent			1
the two bitter rivals are due to clash at the @entity7 in @entity8 on november 29 but @entity9 has repeatedly failed to show up at scheduled events			1
and @entity3 , who flew in from @entity11 on monday , was in no mood to disguise his fury			2
@entity3 with promoter @entity14 and a cardboard cut - out of @entity0 ' i think that the hard man of @entity18 , who 's brave when he 's punching away behind his keyboard on @entity20 , was exposed in front of the media today as a bottle job , when it came to meet me face - to - face , ' he said			2
' to think , i travelled from @entity11 to @entity8 , getting up early to make the flight , doing my contracted promotional pr work , going to @entity27 , and then flying home , yet the @entity29 could n't even attend without his dad holding his hand			1
' he needs to man up , stop playing the hard gangster act , cut his baby reigns and be his own man			0
he 's 25 years old and still mollycoddled by his dad and trainer , its like they still powder him with baby talc at night , pat him for wind and sing a lullaby for him , it 's embarrassing for a grown man who 's supposed to be a fighter			0
@entity0 has failed to show at three events to promote his fight with @entity3 later this month ' i 'm just playing with him , i 'm not going to give him a slap at a press conference , why waste my time , if he 's worried about that now he should be a lot more worried when i 'll be punching him on november 29 in front of 20,000 fans , live on tv			1
i 've no interest to do him now , i 'll bide my time and get him in the ring			0
' he 's hiding behind his dad and lawyer and letting them do the fighting for him , i say come out and fight like a man			0
' once the cotton wool has been unwrapped from him and he 's in that ring all alone , i 'll set about him like a wolf to a new born baby dear , i 'll rip him to shreds			0
