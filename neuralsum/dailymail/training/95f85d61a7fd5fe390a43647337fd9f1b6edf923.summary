by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 10:28 est , 4 september 2012 the prime minister is known to be a fan of technology ever since it emerged that he 's addicted to playing @entity6 on his @entity7			0
but today @entity8 truly cemented his reputation as a man of the modern world by announcing his cabinet reshuffle on @entity14 - in 140 characters or less			1
in a series of micro messages from behind the door of @entity18 @entity8 told his 2million followers exactly who he 'd decided to hire and fire , signing off with the hashtag # reshuffle			2
announcements : in a series of micro messages from behind the door of @entity18 @entity8 told his 2million @entity14 followers exactly who he has decided to hire and fire - and more messages look set to follow the tweeting appeared to have been triggered by @entity28 who used her official @ @entity14 account at 2am to steal mr @entity8 's thunder and confirm she was ' signing off ' , saying it had been ' a privilege and an honour to serve my party as co-chairman '			1
but at 10am the @entity2 proved he too is a social media fan by tweeting more than 14 times about various new appointments from his @ number10gov account , including the sensational appointment of culture secretary @entity41 as secretary of state for health			1
he replaces @entity43 who has been spectacularly sacked because of his failure to push through @entity46 reforms and made @entity47 instead			0
time to move on : @entity8 , pictured leading his first cabinet meeting at number 10 in may 2010 , is today announcing his first full reshuffle since then - and he 's using @entity14 to help him it 's the first time a prime minister has used @entity14 to announce a cabinet reshuffle and shows just how significant social media has become - even within the government			1
normally cabinet reshuffle details come via more formal statements released to the media or via announcements in the @entity60			0
this morning , @entity63 's @entity62 's online announcement prompted outgoing welsh secretary @entity64 to also announce her own job loss on @entity14			2
night owl : @entity28 tweeted to admit that she was no longer co-chairman of the conservative party following suit : welsh secretary @entity64 then replied to @entity28 saying that she had also been given the chop - complete with smiley emoticon online : @entity63 's @entity62 's left , online announcement prompted outgoing welsh secretary @entity64 , right , to also announce her own job loss on @entity14 replying to @entity28 's tweet she said : ' signing off @ @entity74 too but i agree great privilege to serve in cabinet but can serve party from back benches too			2
' later mr @entity8 tweeted that justice minister @entity80 had been appointed minister without portfolio - a demotion from his justice secretary role which has been given to @entity84 - also announced on the micro-blogging site			1
further announcements including the demotion of @entity88 , who was stripped of her role as @entity90 and handed the secretary of state for international development job , with @entity92 stepping into her former role			0
# reshuffle : normally information about cabinet reshuffles comes via more formal statements released the media or announcements in the @entity60 - but the pm is embracing social media meanwhile @entity101 was named @entity102 and minister for women and equalities			0
it 's not clear if it is mr @entity8 himself posting the messages - it 's more likely to be one of his aides familiar with the ins and outs of @entity14			1
a @entity113 spokesman said : ' @entity14 is only one of the channels that @entity18 uses to communicate to large audiences , it has n't replaced other means			0
' balancing act : several senior cabinet members , including @entity80 , lost their current jobs today			0

@entity8 's tweeted at least 14 times since 10am this morning detailing his new appointments
it 's the first time a @entity2 has made *re-shuffle* announcements via the micro-blogging site
