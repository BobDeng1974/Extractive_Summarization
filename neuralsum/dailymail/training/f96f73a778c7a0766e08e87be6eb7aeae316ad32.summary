international condemnation : @entity2 's prime minister @entity1 has been strongly criticised after branding @entity3 ' a crime against humanity ' @entity2 's prime minister , has been strongly criticised after branding @entity3 ' a crime against humanity			1
' @entity1 told a @entity10 forum this week : ' as with @entity3 , anti-semitism and fascism , it is inevitable that @entity14 be considered a crime against humanity			1
' new @entity18 secretary of state @entity17 is expected to take @entity2 's prime minister to task for the ' objectionable ' comments during his visit to the country			1
@entity17 , on his first trip to a @entity26 nation since taking office , is meeting @entity29 leaders for talks meant to focus on @entity32 's civil war and bilateral interests from energy security to counter-terrorism			1
but comment by @entity29 prime minister @entity1 at a @entity10 meeting in @entity37 this week , condemned by his @entity39 counterpart , the @entity40 and @entity10 @entity41 ban ki - moon , has clouded his trip			1
' this was particularly offensive , frankly , to call @entity3 a crime against humanity ... it does have a corrosive effect ( on relations ) , ' a senior @entity18 official told reporters as @entity17 flew to @entity51			2
' i am sure the secretary will be very clear about how dismayed we were to hear it , ' the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said			0
criticism : @entity18 secretary of state @entity17 arrives in @entity51 , @entity2 - he is expected to take @entity2 's prime minister to task for the ' objectionable ' comments during his visit ' to state the obvious , it complicates our ability to do all of the things that we want to do together when we have such a profound disagreement about such an important thing			1
' @entity69 needs all the allies it can get as it navigates the political currents of the @entity72 , and sees @entity2 as the key player in supporting @entity32 's opposition and planning for the era after president @entity77			2
but the collapse of @entity51 's ties with @entity39 have undermined @entity18 hopes that @entity2 could play a role as a broker in the broader region			1
' the @entity2 - @entity39 relationship is frozen , ' the @entity18 official said			2
' we want to see a normalization ... not just for the sake of the two countries but for the sake of the region and , frankly , for the symbolism , ' he said			0
' not that long ago ( you ) had these two countries demonstrating that a majority @entity26 country could have very positive and strong relations with the jewish state and that was a sign for the region ( of what was ) possible			0
' unwelcome : the comments were condemned by his @entity39 counterpart , @entity100 , left , the @entity40 and @entity10 @entity41 ban ki - moon , right @entity1 's caustic rhetoric on @entity39 has won applause from conservative supporters at home but raised increasing concern among @entity108 allies			1
' @entity1 's comments about @entity39 have become progressively more worrying , ' said @entity110 , president of the @entity111			1
' this type of rhetoric is pushing @entity2 further away from the @entity114 and @entity115 and closer to @entity116			0
' ties between @entity39 and mostly @entity2 have been frosty since 2010 , when @entity39 marines killed nine @entity29 in fighting aboard a @entity120 aid ship that tried to breach @entity39 's blockade of the @entity122			1
in recent weeks , there has been a run of reports in the @entity29 and @entity39 media about efforts to repair relations , including a senior diplomatic meeting last month in @entity130 and military equipment transfers			2
refusal : @entity69 has given $ 385 million in humanitarian aid for @entity32 but @entity18 president @entity134 has so far refused to give arms the reports have not been confirmed by either government			0
@entity2 's relations with the @entity18 have always been prickly , driven more by a mutual need for intelligence than any deep cultural affinity			2
and @entity1 's populist rhetoric , sometimes at apparent odds with @entity18 interests , is aimed partly at a domestic audience wary of @entity69 's influence			1
but the two have strong common interests			0
officials said @entity32 would top the agenda in @entity17 's meetings with @entity1 and president @entity152 , building on the discussions in @entity130 between 11 mostly @entity115 and @entity155 nations within the ' friends of @entity32 ' group			1
after the @entity130 meeting , @entity17 said on thursday the @entity18 would for the first time give non-lethal aid to the rebels and more than double support to the civilian opposition , although @entity108 powers stopped short of pledging arms			2
' we need to continue the discussion which took place in @entity130 ... in terms of the main goals there is no daylight between us and the @entity18 , ' a senior @entity29 official said			0
' a broad agreement was reached on supporting the opposition			0
now our sides need to sit down and really flesh out what we can do to support them in order to change the balance on the ground , ' he said			0
@entity2 has been one of @entity77 's fiercest critics , hosting a @entity186 @entity185 missile defence system , including two @entity18 batteries , to protect against a spillover of violence and leading calls for international intervention			0
it has spent more than $ 600 million sheltering refugees from the conflict that began almost two years ago , housing some 180,000 in camps near the border and tens of thousands more who are staying with relatives or in private accommodation			0
@entity69 has given $ 385 million in humanitarian aid for @entity32 but @entity18 president @entity134 has so far refused to give arms , arguing it is difficult to prevent them from falling into the hands of militants who could use them on @entity108 targets			0
@entity2 , too , has been reluctant to provide weapons , fearing direct intervention could cause the conflict to spill across its borders .			0
