by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 12:06 est , 12 november 2012 babies given calpol and other forms of paracetamol are more likely to develop asthma before going to school , say @entity8 researchers babies given calpol and other forms of paracetamol are more likely to develop asthma before going to school , say researchers			1
more exposure to the drug resulted in a greater chance of developing the condition			0
the latest study from @entity8 adds to mounting evidence of a link between the painkiller and asthma , with previous research into adults and babies suggesting its use increased the risk of the disease			1
scientists believe paracetamol may cause changes in the body that leave children more vulnerable to inflammation and allergies			1
the study published in the @entity37 says paracetamol has not been proven to cause asthma			2
but senior researcher @entity39 , a professor of pediatrics at the @entity41 , advised parents to only use the drug when needed , such as when a child has a fever			0
‘ we would like to stress that the use of this drug indeed is beneficial in the appropriate circumstances , ’ he said			0
the study included 336 children who were followed from birth to age seven			2
all had mothers with asthma , which put them at increased risk for the lung disease themselves			0
overall , 19 per cent of the children had asthma - like symptoms by the age of three , meaning recurrent bouts of wheezing , breathlessness or coughing			2
prof @entity39 's team found the risk generally went up the more often a child was given paracetamol , also known as acetaminophen in the first year of life			0
scientists believe paracetamol may cause changes in the body that leave children more vulnerable to inflammation and allergies for each doubling in the number of days a baby received the drug , there was a 28 per cent increase in the risk of asthma symptoms			1
the link disappeared , though , by the time the children were seven years old			0
at that point 14 per cent of the children had asthma , and the risk was no greater for those given the drug as babies			1
researchers said children with asthma tend to get more severe respiratory infections so may have been given more medication as a result			1
one recent study found that children given other common pain medications , including ibuprofen and naproxen , also had an increased asthma risk			1
the researchers said that suggested children with asthma symptoms were simply more likely to need the medications			2
‘ we think it is too early to conclude a causal relationship , but the findings should encourage further research into a ‘ plausible biological mechanism ’			0
an international study , covering 300,000 teenagers in 50 countries , also found paracetamol users were more likely to suffer from the skin disorder eczema and allergic nasal conditions .			0
