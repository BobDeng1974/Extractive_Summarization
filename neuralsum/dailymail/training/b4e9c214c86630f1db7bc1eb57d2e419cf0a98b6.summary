by @entity0 published : 09:09 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 07:26 est , 16 september 2013 is your name @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 or @entity6 ? if so , you 're likely to be a man in demand after new research revealed that having a shortened name increases your appeal among the opposite sex			1
women who call themselves @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 are also set to benefit as the effect is the same regardless of sex			1
overall , the new study found that shorter names had greater appeal than longer ones in a huge 72 per cent of cases			2
romantic success : having a shortened name can increase your appeal to the opposite sex , a survey has found women did have a slight advantage though : while 79 per cent of men found shortened names appealing , the same was true for just 69 per cent of female respondents			1
the study was conducted by online dating site @entity35 , which studied the approaches made by its 190 million users and compared the number of emails sent to those who used shortened versions of their names to those who used their full names			2
' attractiveness online is not only about looks , ' says a spokesperson for @entity35			0
' even the length of your name , it seems , may also make a surprising difference			0
' ' your name says a huge amount about you , ' says @entity57 , a behavioural psychologist and dating coach			0
' people with abbreviated names appear more approachable and friendlier ; less intimidating			1
a diminutive name gives a sense of warmth and informality			0
” in the @entity72 , men with who used diminutives such as @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 or @entity71 attracted more female approaches per head than those named @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 or @entity79 respectively			1
would @entity80 and @entity81 be as popular ? @entity82 and @entity83 have worked well for mr @entity84 and ms @entity85 likewise , women called @entity87 , @entity88 or @entity89 attracted more male advances than those named @entity92 , @entity93 or @entity94			1
the general preference for short names , particularly for men , can also be seen in romantic novels whose square - jawed heroes typically have brief and often one - syllable names			2
in fact , the length of your name affects not only your allure but also your income as another recent study found			0
studies of marriage records also show that your choice of husband or wife is influenced by the sound of their name			0
' people are slightly more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own , even if the similarity is just sharing a first initial , ' writes psychologist @entity122 in his book @entity123			2
so , men named @entity125 are more likely than others to marry women named @entity128 , while women named @entity130 are often drawn to men named @entity132 or even @entity133			1
not only does your name reveal how popular you are with the opposite sex and how well you are paid , it can also give clues to how you 're perceived by your friends			0
a new study has found that men called @entity138 are seen to be the most loyal by friends and the same is true for women named @entity141 and @entity142			1
for advice , men are most likely to turn to friends named @entity145 but when life gets tough , it 's friends named @entity148 , @entity149 or @entity150 that they most want to see			1
women , meanwhile , are likely to have known a friend called @entity153 for the longest amount of time but will turn to friends named @entity157 , @entity158 or @entity159 when they need help			1
the research , which was conducted by @entity162 , also found that a fifth of @entity72 people see their best friends at least once a week , with one in three saying their best friends are more important to them than family members			2
dr @entity169 , a psychologist at the @entity170 comments : ' the way in which names can influence someone ’s personality is a self - fulfilling prophecy and without recognising it , we build a mental image and certain expectations of what a person is like based on their name			0
' meeting another ' @entity138 ' will lead to a subconscious consideration about the original acquaintance , that in turn , helps hone the belief that he , too possesses similar qualities			0
' interestingly many parents name their children after a person they particularly like			0
some names happen to be more successful than others and some sound more attractive			0
' so it seems that the names that have the best influence on people ’s lives keep getting reused again and again			2

people preferred those who used diminutives 72 *%* of the time
among women , @entity205 is preferred to @entity207 , @entity82 to @entity80 and so on
men liked women named @entity17 instead of @entity158 and @entity14 rather than @entity211
experts say it is because a shortened name sounds more approachable
