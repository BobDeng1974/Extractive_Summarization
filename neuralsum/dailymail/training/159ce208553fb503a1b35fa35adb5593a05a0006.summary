stunning pictures from the top of the world show a unique view of lightning storms as they rain down on @entity5			0
the stellar images take storm chasing to new heights , having been snapped from a space station 400 miles above the @entity5			0
one of the most the impressive images shows the early morning @entity12 skies above @entity13 and @entity14 aglow with powerful flashes of lighting			0
as the @entity18 endured summer thunderstorms , here 's how lightening looks from space			0
the images , taken by @entity23 , demonstrate the power of nature seen as flashes of white over the @entity5 's surface the white bursts can clearly be seen forming abstract patterns above the orange lights of the cities below			0
the photographs were taken from the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) orbiting the planet by @entity23 astronaut @entity36			1
the storms erupted earlier this week , providing a spectacular light show for the astronaut			2
@entity23 astronaut @entity36 captured the stunning images			1
they reveal storms above @entity43 and @entity44 , with this one of capturing an elusive red sprite			1
sprites are shards of light caused by large - scale electrical discharges that take place high above thunderstorm clouds @entity57 clouds , trails of meteor showers and the @entity54 rising on the horizon can also been seen in @entity36 's breath - taking photographs she also photographed storms above @entity43 and @entity44 , with one of her images capturing an elusive red sprite			1
the phenomenon occurs when instead of shooting down towards the ground , lightning explodes in the clouds 50 miles up and fire the red tendrils even higher			1
the massive explosion happened above @entity67 and the red sprite seen in this rare picture is six miles wide			2
the storms erupted earlier this week , providing a spectacular light show for the astronaut @entity57 clouds , trails of meteor showers and the @entity54 rising on the horizon can also been seen in @entity36 ’s breath - taking photographs			1
@entity36 , 43 , was the 50th woman in space and is on board the @entity34 as a flight engineer – one of six astronauts taking part in the mission , @entity81			2
the mother - of - one grew up in @entity83 and is married to fellow @entity23 astronaut @entity84			0
@entity36 , 43 , who took the photos , was the 50th woman in space and is on board the @entity34 as a flight engineer her images follow that of an amateur astronomer , released yesterday , who has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike ' into space ' above the @entity95			1
the atmospheric phenomena , known as sprites , had never been recorded in the @entity18 before an amateur astronomer in @entity99 managed to take the photographic first			0
@entity101 , 33 , spotted the sprite - caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of @entity104 .			0

astronaut @entity36 has captured the images from the @entity34 earlier this week
one of her images captured an elusive red sprite , where instead of shooting down towards the ground , lightning explodes in the clouds
