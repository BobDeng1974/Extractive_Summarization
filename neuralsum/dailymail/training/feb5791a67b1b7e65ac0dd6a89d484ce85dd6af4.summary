@entity0 returned one of his self - labelled ‘ death stares ’ when @entity3 dared to suggest this week that his chances of managing @entity5 had passed			1
he did , in fairness , kill the query with a smile – kind of – but his wider point was : ‘ why has my chance gone ? ’ he very quickly left the room			2
a parallel with @entity13 was the subtext of the question ; @entity17 managers once touted for the national job but no longer in the running , at least according to bookmakers ’ markets and popular opinion , which has the likes of @entity24 and @entity25 as the heir apparents – even @entity27 is quoted at shorter odds			1
@entity29 manager @entity0 has his side in sparkling @entity32 form with six wins on the spin @entity13 has surprised many as @entity36 make a charge towards the top - flight 's top four @entity40 , of course , is safe until after @entity5 cruise through qualifying and flop at @entity44			1
and so the search will begin			2
were we , however , to employ the yardsticks of performance and experience in determining the favourites , @entity0 and @entity13 would lead the way			0
the pair meet at @entity54 on saturday afternoon , @entity0 ’s @entity52 flying high in fifth with @entity13 ’s @entity36 in their slipstream			1
they are the two longest - serving englishmen in the @entity32 – @entity0 12 days short of four years , @entity13 just six months behind			1
in total , their time in the dugout amounts to nearly 40 years			0
yet the notion of them one day being employed by the @entity61 appears to be dead			0
@entity13 – with his stock at its highest in 2006 – lost out to @entity65 for the @entity5 post and has long since been critical of foreign appointments			1
@entity69 striker @entity68 celebrates after scoring for the @entity36 away at @entity70 last weekend @entity71 runs towards @entity0 after netting a late winner against @entity73 at @entity74 @entity0 , meanwhile , has muddied his own cv during the course of touchline confrontations with @entity79 boss @entity78 and @entity81 midfielder @entity80 , not to mention shoving an assistant referee			1
does all of that , though , not make their case all the stronger ? they have dealt with adversity – a guaranteed circumstance with @entity5 – and survived ; their longevity is unrivalled			1
indeed , in the past 12 months both have been that ‘ beleaguered boss ’ at which the media takes aim , ultimately riding the storm to emerge in far more cordial climes			0
@entity0 , from the position of comfort which six wins on the spin affords , addressed the issue this week			0
‘ in the @entity32 you come under pressure from time to time , ’ he said			1
‘ you have to be big enough to handle that			0
some of it gets personal and you have to deal with that , you might not like it			0
‘ @entity13 has more experience of the @entity32 than i do			1
he knows what it takes to win and he ’s adaptable			0
@entity24 ( second left ) has more of a chance of landing @entity40 's job than @entity0 or @entity13 even @entity114 boss @entity27 is fancied more for the role than the two in - form @entity116 ‘ you have to keep your message consistent and not lose faith in yourself and what you ’re doing			2
’ @entity120 and @entity0 , then , simply better suited to the club - management environment in which they have thrived for so long ? @entity0 , it seems , still fancies a shot at @entity5			2
do n’t forget , he was @entity125 and @entity126 in 2012 and part of the thinking behind his unprecedented eight - year contract with @entity29 was to inflate any compensation package should the @entity61 come calling			2
but @entity5 have moved on			2
rather , it is the @entity131 and the @entity132 who are the future and a new ‘ promote from within ’ ethos			0
@entity0 and @entity13 , meanwhile , are very much on the outside			0
just do n't mention that to their face .			0

@entity29 and @entity36 are flying in the @entity32
the pair do *battle* at @entity54 on saturday
but neither managers look likely of landing the @entity5 job
