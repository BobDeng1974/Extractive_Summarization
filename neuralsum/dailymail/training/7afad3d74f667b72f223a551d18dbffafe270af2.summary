' ever since i was a little kid , it 's what i 've wanted to do , ' @entity0 told @entity9			2
' in college , i did n't even graduate school because my senior year , i honestly let school be a casualty to that because i knew i had one opportunity to make it to the @entity2 , and i put everything into that			0

' as far as after football , who knows			0
my life will revolve around football to some point , but i 'd rather have the experience of playing and , who knows , die 10 , 15 years earlier than not be able to play in the @entity2 and live a long life			2
