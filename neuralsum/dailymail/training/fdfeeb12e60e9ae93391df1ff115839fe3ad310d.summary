by @entity0 and @entity1 a @entity3 judge , who said incest was becoming more socially acceptable , has been stepped down until an investigation into his comments is complete			1
judge @entity7 , aged in his 60s , has come under fire after saying the community may no longer see sexual contact between siblings and between adults and children as ' unnatural ' or ' taboo ' , just as homosexuality is now widely accepted			2
the comments were made while he was presiding over a case of a woman who had allegedly been sexually abused by her older brother when she was 10 and 18 years old			2
judge @entity7 said the abuse she suffered as an adult did not need to be considered in relation to the abuse she suffered as a child because by that time she had been ' sexually awoken ' , the @entity20 reported			1
judge @entity7 will not take on any new court cases while his comments are being investigated late on friday , chief judge of the @entity32 justice @entity31 made the announcement that @entity34 would not be taking on any more cases			1
' i have now been advised by the attorney - general that he has referred the matter to the @entity39 and judge @entity34 will not sit in crime until this matter is determined , ' he said in a statement			0
justice @entity43 said no further comment would be made on the matter			0
judicial commission members will examine the complaint before potentially referring it on to the conduct division			0
they decide whether a complaint justifies the removal of a judicial officer			0
bravehearts founder @entity53 has sent letters to the attorney general and the chief justice of @entity57 calling for judge @entity7 's sacking and demanding a review of all the decisions he has made if they determine judge @entity7 should be sacked , he would become the first judicial judge to be sacked by parliament , according to the @entity20			1
earlier on friday , @entity57 attorney - general @entity64 asked justice @entity43 to prevent judge @entity7 presiding over criminal trials while he was investigated by the judicial commission			1
' with that context i was extremely concerned to read the comments of his honour judge @entity7 in regard to his views on incest , ' mr @entity64 said in a statement			1
' in my view , the community would be rightly appalled at his reported comments			0
' incest is completely reprehensible , unacceptable , disgusting and criminal			0
' but judge @entity7 defended his comments to @entity78 : ' my comments were taken completely out of context , i think it 's a fabrication '			1
judge @entity7 made the comments in the case of a 58 - year - old western @entity3 man who is charged with repeatedly sexually abusing his younger sister at the family home in 1981			1
he said that just as community attitudes towards homosexuality had changed since the 1950s and 1960s : ' a jury might find nothing untoward in the advance of a brother towards his sister once she had sexually matured , had sexual relationships with other men and was now " available " , not having [ a ] sexual partner '			2
judge @entity7 also said : ' if this was the 50s and you had a jury of 12 men there , which is what you 'd invariably have , they would say it 's unnatural for a man to be interested in another man or a man being interested in a boy			1
' the 58 - year - old man had previously pleaded guilty to raping his sister when she was 10 or 11 years old in the 1970s			2
but he pleaded not guilty to the charge of sexual intercourse without consent , with an alternative charge of incest , relating to the events in 1981			0
@entity57 attorney general @entity64 has asked the chief judge of the district court justice @entity31 to prevent judge @entity7 presiding over criminal trials on april 7 , the @entity125 requested the jury be told of his previous convictions , arguing that without this knowledge jurors may struggle to understand that the man had a tendency to be sexually attracted to his sister and may also question why she never told other family members of the abuse			1
but judge @entity7 refused , saying the abuse she suffered as an adult did not need to be considered in relation to the abuse she suffered as a child			2
' by that stage they are both mature adults			0
the complainant has been sexually awoken , shall we say , by having two relationships with men and she had become ' free ' when the second relationship broke down , ' judge @entity7 said			1
judge @entity7 also suggested the only reason incest was still a crime was because to ' prevent chromosomal abnormalities ' , but said that has become less relevant because of the availability of contraception and abortion			1
adults surviving @entity156 president dr @entity155 said judge @entity7 's comments were ' disgraceful ' it has also emerged that in november 2011 judge @entity7 gave a man who raped his niece when she was 15 and 16 a shorter sentence because ' there was no rough handling involved ' and he did not ejaculate			1
the case concerned a 55 - year - old man who indecently assaulted his niece multiple times in her bedroom in 2007 and 2008			2
the man was in a de facto relationship with the victim 's mother and lived in the same home			0
in considering the most serious offence , ' when penile / vaginal intercourse occurred without consent over a number of minutes ' , judge @entity7 took the view that it fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness ' because there had been no ejaculation involved , so that the victim had not been exposed to the risk of pregnancy or having some sexually transmitted disease passed on to her '			1
in the @entity190 in march 2013 justices @entity186 , @entity188 and @entity189 said the comment was ' entirely questionable '			0
justice @entity43 's friday announcement comes after child abuse groups expressed disgust at @entity196 's comments			2
bravehearts founder @entity53 said she had sent a letter to the attorney general and the chief justice of @entity57 calling for judge @entity7 's sacking			1
' i also want them to revisit all the decisions he has made , in case they have created a precedent in sentencing which other judges have had to follow , ' ms @entity53 told @entity78 on friday			2
' clearly he 's held these views for some time and it 's gone unchecked			0
' he â€™s been making all kinds of decisions for years , he 's not a young man			0
' adults surviving @entity156 president dr @entity155 said judge @entity7 's comments were ' disgraceful '			1
' the attorney general needs to look at his appointment , ' dr @entity155 told @entity78			0
' this level of ignorance can not be tolerated on our benches			0
' dr @entity155 added that his ' misogynistic , paternalistic ' views were damaging and said his conflation of incest with homosexuality was offensive			0
' as a society we 've come to understand homosexuality - that does not mean there 's any parallel , not for a second , with child sex abuse and incest			0
