@entity0 will be forced to sack up to one in five of his frontbenchers if he becomes prime minister under rules to stop him wasting public money			1
shadow ministers are braced for a dramatic cull of those offered ’ no - jobs ’ in opposition to quell rebellion			0
the bloodbath will occur even if mr @entity0 wins an overall majority			2
if he is forced into a coalition , even more @entity13 mps will miss out on a ministerial salary			2
labour leader @entity0 will have to make difficult choices about which of his frontbenchers get paid ministerial jobs , and which are sent to the backbenches mr @entity0 wants to use this weeks @entity13 conference in @entity21 to show he is in touch with the concerns of normal voters with just eight months until the general election			1
but privately several of those given frontbench jobs are braced for the chop			0
shadow chancellor @entity29 has also vowed to cut the pay of those who do become ministers by 5 per cent , under efforts to prove he can be trusted with the nation ’s finances			2
mr @entity0 is expected to carry out a reshuffle after the party conference season			0
however , he is already breaking rules introduced 40 years ago to stop political leaders from packing their frontbenchers with @entity12 and @entity42 to increase the party 's grip on discipline			0
labours own analysis shows it has 138 frontbenchers in the @entity48			0
but under the @entity50 passed in 1975 , only 109 ministerial salaries can be paid at any one time			1
it raises the prospect of 29 people - or 21 per cent - who currently think they are heading for a job in government being left bitterly disappointed			2
prime ministers are also banned from having more than 95 ministers in the @entity58 , to ensure those on the government payroll does not dominate @entity60			1
at the @entity13 conference in @entity21 today , mr @entity0 appeared on stage with senior @entity13 figures involved in the @entity65 referendum campaign , including @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 however the most recent full list of @entity13 frontbenchers published shows as many as 105 mps listed with shadow ministerial jobs			1
’ a whole load of people are going to be disappointed , ’ said one @entity13 frontbencher			0
’ in opposition it 's great handing out these jobs , but the rules are clear and people who have been shadowing departments for years will be left out in the cold			0
’ it 's not a great way to start a new government , is it ? ’ one solution to the overall cap on paid ministers is a loophole which allows more frontbenchers , as long as they do not get a salary			0
however , @entity13 was highly critical of @entity96 ’s decision to downgrade the pay and status of the @entity99			0
a @entity13 spokesman said : ‘ all ministerial posts are in the gift of the prime minister			0
’ at the @entity13 conference in @entity21 today , mr @entity29 used his keynote speech to announce plans to cut ministerial pay			1
shadow chancellor @entity29 used his speech to conference today to promise that if mr @entity0 becomes prime minister , he will cut ministerial salaries by 5 per cent he said mr @entity0 and all of the @entity117 ‘ are clear it will mean cuts and tough decisions and we will take the lead ’			1
mr @entity29 added : ‘ if we win the election , on day one of the next @entity13 government , the pay of every government minister will immediately be cut by five per cent			1
‘ ministerial pay will then be frozen each year until we have achieved our promise to balance the nation ’s books ‘ because we are all clear that everybody in the next @entity13 government will be fully focused on that vital task of getting the deficit down			1

prime ministers banned from paying more than 109 ministerial salaries
but @entity0 has got 138 people packed on to the @entity13 frontbench
rules also ban more than 95 mps becoming ministers but he has 105
