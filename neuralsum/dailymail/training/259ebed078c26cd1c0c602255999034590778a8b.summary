@entity0 admits that he knew his ‘ ghost ’ goal was going to be ruled out before the match officials spotted their error in @entity5			1
the @entity7 striker had already pulled @entity9 level against @entity10 when he tucked home a loose ball after @entity14 ’s speculative effort had bounced off the frame of the goal and back into play			1
referee @entity18 awarded the goal and @entity0 gave team - mates an embarrassed smile as he walked back towards the centre circle before it became clear that the ball had gone out			1
‘ we wanted to win games and play well , and obviously we ’ve done that			1
we ’ve won a trophy as well			2
it ’s always nice to beat @entity10			2
we ’re happy with the work we ’ve done out here , now we go on to ( the friendly against ) @entity42 and then the season starts			2
’ @entity0 started the game as captain for the first time under @entity47 and finished it by being named as the @entity30 of the tournament			1
sharpshooter : @entity0 nips in to score as @entity10 defender @entity50 can only watch afterwards , @entity51 hinted that @entity0 could keep the armband on a permanent basis , and the player paid tribute to the impact the @entity57 has had since taking over last month			1
having implemented a new 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 system to suit his squad , @entity51 has won all five games on tour			2
‘ it ’s been a good few weeks , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ we ’ve got a new manager who wants us to play a different style of football			0
we ’ve had to adapt			0
we ’ve had some good results against top opposition so we can be pleased			0
ideal preparation : @entity9 begin their season in less than two weeks when they take on @entity71 ‘ i think the system suits the team , not only myself			1
the manager came in and had a look at the players we ’ve got			0
he ’s done what he thinks is best suited for our team			0
‘ he ’s a tough manager but he ’s been great since he came in			0
he ’s given us all a different way of looking at football , which we have n’t had before			0
it ’s been great for us and hopefully that will continue			0
