by @entity0 a @entity2 minister has launched an extraordinary attack on the @entity6 inquiry ’s decision not to publish secret notes between @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity10 said key evidence was being ‘ filleted ’ and urged mr @entity8 to intervene to insist that it is included in the long - delayed official report into the 2003 conflict			1
sir @entity16 ’s inquiry has been condemned as a whitewash over a deal to keep letters and notes of phone calls between the then @entity23 and @entity24 leaders private			1
@entity2 minister @entity10 insisted the public had a right to know about notes sent between @entity8 and @entity9 in the run - up to the @entity30 war mr @entity10 , a @entity10 minister who is a longstanding critic of the @entity30 war , told the @entity31 : ‘ the @entity24 people have a right to know what was done in their name without it being filleted by those who would like to keep some matters secret			1
' @entity30 is perhaps the most serious undermining of democracy for decades and we need the full facts			0
we are now led to believe @entity8 is happy to have everything published			2
i urge him now to call for that publicly			0
' last month , cabinet secretary sir @entity47 vetoed the release of the correspondence in the run - up to the 2003 conflict , insisting that only their ‘ gist ’ is included in sir @entity16 ’s findings			1
in them , mr @entity8 is said to have promised the @entity23 president : ' you know , @entity9 , whatever you decide to do , i 'm with you			2
' the official reason for the censorship is that publication would deter prime ministers from speaking freely in private			0
but @entity65 sources claim security chiefs and officials in @entity68 have been firmly against their release			0
' the @entity24 people have a right to know what was done in their name without it being filleted by those who would like to keep some matters secret ' sir @entity16 said the inquiry now hopes to publish ‘ gists and quotes ’ from some of the messages			2
he said this was crucial in order for people to understand the inquiry ’s conclusions			0
but the letters will not be published in full and any quotes will be kept to the ‘ minimum necessary ’ , and following the protests from the @entity23 , no details of mr @entity9 ’s messages will be published			2
mr @entity10 ’s intervention comes after former prime minister sir @entity92 warned that the decision not to allow the @entity95 inquiry to publish the full correspondence would allow conspiracy theories to ' fester '			1
he said it was a ' pity ' that only the gist of the notes and conversations would be published , and also urged mr @entity8 to publicly call for the details to be published in full			0
mr @entity8 , who is expected to face heavy criticism in the report , has always denied trying to block the release of the messages			1
sources close to the former prime minister insist it is in his interests for the @entity112 report finally to be published because it will allow him to ‘ make the argument ’ about why he took @entity24 to war			0
the @entity95 inquiry held its last public hearings in 2011 , but publication of its conclusions has been held back by wrangling over the publication of the private communications between mr @entity8 and mr @entity9			0
sir @entity47 is said to have backed concerns from intelligence services and diplomats that publishing the documents might jeopardise the ‘ special relationship ’ between the @entity24 and the @entity23			1
senior @entity65 figures are also said to have expressed alarm at the precedent that would be set by disclosing private discussions between a @entity24 prime minister and another world leader			0
sir @entity16 is thought to have wanted to publish sensitive material , covering some 200 cabinet - level discussions , 25 notes from mr @entity8 to mr @entity9 and more than 130 records of conversations between the pm and the @entity23 president , in full			1
the deal that was agreed last month between the @entity144 and the inquiry broke the deadlock , and means the findings are expected to be published at the end of this year .			0
