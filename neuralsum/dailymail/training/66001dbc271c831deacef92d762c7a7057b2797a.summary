the mother of conjoined twins born with one body and two heads has described how her 11 - day old daughters are already showing ' very separate ' personalities			1
' you have to see it to believe it , ' @entity6 told @entity10 , ' sometimes @entity11 will cry and wake @entity13 up , who then looks sideways as if to say , " thanks for that "			1
' we are blessed we 've got this far			0
i just find them adorable			0
' the girls ' father , @entity21 , said he was amazed at the progress the girls have made in hospital since their birth on may 8			1
' each time i come means they 've reached another milestone and pulled through another day , ' he said			0
the babies , @entity11 and @entity13 , were christened at @entity30 after their miraculous birth on may 8			1
' i think they 're beautiful and @entity21 thinks they 're beautiful , so really , that 's all that matters , ' ms @entity6 told @entity35			1
despite doctors initially telling the couple to terminate the pregnancy , they have been told the girls have a strong chance if they survive the next five weeks			0
the girls were born with a rare condition called diprosopus , which means they share the same body and vital organs but have their own faces and brains which are connected by only one brain stem			1
' even though there is only one body , we call them our twins			0
to us , they are our girls and we love them , ' mr @entity21 told @entity10			2
' we have no idea how long they will be in hospital			0
we just want to bring them home , happy and healthy to make our family a little bit bigger and a bit more chaotic			0
' @entity13 and @entity11 's have their own brains which are connected by only one brain stem ' i think they 're beautiful and @entity21 thinks they 're beautiful so really that 's all that matters , ' their mother said			1
as the parents of seven other children , @entity94 and her husband @entity21 never considered terminating while the girls grew healthy the condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived			1
due to the complex nature of @entity11 and @entity13 's condition , doctors are unsure about what to expect and they are being forced to make their prognoses day by day			1
mr @entity21 confirmed that specialists were called in to decipher a range of problems and assess the twins in great depth , from the functioning of their lungs and blood vessels to decisions about how best to proceed with feeding			2
but despite all the forewarned medial problems likely to come their way , ms @entity6 and mr @entity21 are happy their girls are alive and well			1
' i think they 're beautiful and @entity21 thinks they 're beautiful so really that 's all that matters , ' ms @entity6 told @entity35			2
mr @entity21 said : ' i sort of do n't believe in terminating the baby if it 's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan ' their mother @entity94 gave birth to the girls via an emergency caesarean their condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived from as early as 28 weeks into ms @entity6 ’s pregnancy , specialists were concerned about grave developmental issues			1
one of the biggest predicted survival risks from their doctor @entity138 was that the babies would be unable to breathe on their own			0
the couple , who are parents to seven other children , were also told early on in the pregnancy not to keep the child ‘ because it would be looked upon by the public as a freak ’			0
they defied the doctors because ms @entity6 had never terminated a pregnancy and because they had a family ' that gives us a lot of support '			2
at first , things looked to be taking a turn for the worst as ms @entity6 unexpectedly went into labour at only 32 weeks on may 8 , and was forced to have an emergency caesarean			2
the couple refused to terminate their unborn twins despite being warned by doctors of the medical and social problems the girls were likely to suffer channel 9 were given the honour of choosing the middle names of the newborns , picking @entity171 and @entity172 the twin girls were not breathing in the first few moments after their birth , leaving their parents in a state of great anxiety the girls have defied all odds and are currently in a stable condition and breathing without any assistance			2
although the couple were aware from the early stages of pregnancy that their children would have great developmental problems , they said that while they continued to grow healthily , they could n’t come to terms with letting their unborn twins go			0
' we sort of looked at it as ; it 'd be the same as being a child with autism or @entity196			0
i sort of do n't believe in terminating the baby if it 's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan , ' mr @entity21 said			2
the proud parents of the small survivors have braced themselves for a difficult path ahead and refuse to say goodbye prematurely			0
' i would say , if i only get two days with the baby , i only get two days with the baby - at least i have some time with it , ' ms @entity6 said			0
the conjoined twins share all their major organs apart from their brains it was at 19 weeks into her pregnancy that ms @entity6 became aware that her unborn babies were conjoined source : the @entity215			1
