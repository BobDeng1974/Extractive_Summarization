@entity1 manager @entity0 is adamant his side are not heading into the @entity3 like lambs to the slaughter and insists their current plight is being over-exaggerated			1
having lost to @entity11 , scraped past @entity12 and been held to a goalless draw at home to @entity15 in the last week , the last place you would want to take your team is @entity16			1
the @entity18 holders and @entity20 leaders dished out a lesson at @entity22 two weeks ago , racing into a 3 - 0 half - time lead before easing off as they saved themselves for the @entity26 against @entity27 , and the fear is they could run amok on home turf			1
but @entity0 stressed there would be no conceding this game - even though the reality remains that their @entity62 future will be decided by the final two matches against @entity64 and @entity66 minnows @entity65			1
' we are certainly not coming here as a team expecting to lose and then look at the other games as games to qualify , ' @entity0 said			1
' for us , we see it as an opportunity			2
we still very much have qualification in our hands			2
' it is a wonderful arena - one of the iconic football grounds in the world - and , when you come up against the best opponents , that is the challenge and what makes you perform to your best			0
' they are probably the best team in the world at the moment and we really look forward to big games			2
' we see them as an opportunity rather than a threat to what we are doing			1
@entity0 shakes hands with @entity41 as they train for the final time before facing @entity16 @entity16 are expected to complete the double over @entity1 after their victory at @entity22 last month @entity1 are lacking firepower up front , with @entity41 yet to score in the @entity97 @entity31 looked roused in training ahead of tuesday 's clash at the @entity3 in @entity16 @entity101 's men have won 11 on the trot , including seven straight wins in the league @entity1 ran out 5 - 0 winners on aggregate after a 4 - 0 win at @entity22 and a fine performance in @entity16 in 2009 ' our defence have come under quite a bit of criticism			1
it is nowhere near as bad as people make out			0
' what has been the frustration defensively has been the mistakes and sloppy goals we have given away			0
' there have n't been too many times when the team has been outdone			0
' when you have an attacking philosophy you are going to be susceptible in your defensive side because you are not sat with nine players behind the ball			2
' you are looking to control and dominate the game , but we have to eradicate the errors			0
' the key , even though we know it is tough , is to make sure we are compact and disciplined in our game			0
' i think we showed in the previous game , although the score was 3 - 0 , we can still have moments when we can hurt @entity16 and that will be the idea ( on tuesday )			1
' there is absolutely no question we have the courage			0
this is a team and a group of players who have been so brave to take on the challenge i have asked them to			0
