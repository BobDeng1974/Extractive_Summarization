prosecutor @entity30 said : ‘ it ’s the @entity32 ’s case that , frustrated by the distraction of @entity8 screaming , the defendant picked her up and gripped her around her torso and shook her in a sudden loss of temper and loss of control			1

i had a fit and when i woke up the baby was underneath me			1
’ @entity8 was admitted to the @entity84 in @entity16 with brain damage , and other injuries including bruising to her face , chest , abdomen and lower limbs			1
miss @entity45 told the court : ‘ she was unconscious , unresponsive and , although emergency procedures carried out by the ambulance crew re-established a heart - beat , she was unable to maintain any respiratory effort without life support			2
’ she was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at @entity98 , @entity99 , but died four days later			2
miss @entity45 added : ‘ the combination of the post-mortem findings of recent head injury , recent traumatic laceration of the liver and recent fracture of the left clavicle is consistent with inflicted injury of the shaking / impact type			0

miss @entity45 said it took him some time to become fully awake and he went into the kitchen to make himself some coffee			0

when @entity7 arrived to collect some clothes , he told one of them : ‘ i f * * * ing had a fit , for f * * * ’s sake			1
’ dr @entity131 , a consultant neurologist , found it was ‘ highly unlikely ’ that a seizure was a substantial contributor to @entity8 ’s injuries , the court heard			1
had he suffered a seizure , dr @entity131 would have expected him to drop anything he was holding , put it down and remember later , miss @entity45 said			0
miss @entity45 said : ‘ even if he had fallen on to @entity8 , her pattern of injuries is not consistent with a fall and crushing alone			1
dr @entity131 would have expected more disturbance to adjacent furniture than reported			0
’ @entity7 was charged with murder but went on to plead guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of lack of intent at @entity147 ( pictured ) one expert found @entity8 had sustained two episodes that had led to injury to her chest bones - one up to three weeks before she died and a second up to five days before death			1
when @entity7 was told he would be arrested , miss @entity45 said he became upset and said : ‘ i suppose you are going to say that you know what it is like to be accused of killing your daughter			1

she went on : ‘ all experts agree that the defendant ’s ability to cope with , and process stress , is poor			0
‘ the incident of non-accidental injury to @entity8 did not occur during a functional non-epileptic attack disorder , however , the fact that he does have fits of psychological origin as a response to stress , conflict and anxiety is a significant marker of his inability to cope with stress			2
’ defence counsel @entity200 , @entity30 said @entity7 had asked him to convey ‘ contrition and remorse ’ , adding : ‘ he feels that one life is over , but his is too			2
’ mr @entity200 told the court : ‘ there can be no greater tragedy in life than the death of a child			0
a young child , a life extinguished , compounded by the fact it was at the hands of a loving parent			0
’ mr @entity200 said @entity7 would forever ‘ carry the heavy burden ’ knowing he has killed his daughter ‘ and there can be very little that one can say for mitigation ’			2
‘ this is a man who is unable to cope properly with stress , ’ he said			0
‘ these were not the actions of a reasonable man but a man who has struggled with various forms of medical diagnosis over the years			0
‘ the best part of his mitigation is that he has pleaded guilty to this dreadful offence			0
’ @entity7 was charged with murder but went on to plead guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of lack of intent at @entity147 last week , which was accepted by the @entity32			2
