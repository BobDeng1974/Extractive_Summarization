male members of president @entity14 's socialist cabinet will be taught how to avoid ' stereotyping and inappropriate language ' when talking about women			0
the idea is the brainchild of new women 's rights minister and staunch feminist @entity20			2
it comes after a recent blunder by agriculture minister @entity23 , who told @entity25 magazine : ' out of 15 people in my cabinet , seven are women			1
' i 've tried to promote women as much as possible , even though the subjects are very technical			1
' two months earlier , housing minister @entity2 was wolf - whistled by men in parliament after she walked into the chamber wearing a knee - length dress			1
former sports minister @entity35 also said she avoided wearing skirts altogether for fear of attracting smutty comments			1
the debate over sexism amongst powerful public figures erupted last year after shamed former @entity43 chief @entity42 was accused of sexually assaulting a @entity45 hotel maid			0
one left - wing politician caused outrage by describing the scandal as the ' debagging of a female servant '			0
so far 12 ministers have attended an hour - long course by feminist academics on how not to be sexist , and another 26 more are signed up to attend			1
a government source said : ' the ministers have loved it			0
they 're coming up with ideas on where and how they can put what they have learned into practice			0
the idea is the brainchild of new women 's rights minister @entity20 , left and right , shamed former @entity43 chief @entity42 who triggered the debate over sexism among high profile figures ' for those already aware of the issues , it 's good to hear them again			2
for those who are n't , it 's especially useful			0
' socialist president @entity14 has sought to break with sexist traditions of the past by appointing the same number of female as male ministers for the first time in @entity6 history			2
@entity6 now ranks ahead of @entity83 and the @entity84 in terms of female representation in parliament , with the share of women rising to 27 percent in last year 's legislative election , from 19 percent five years earlier .			0
