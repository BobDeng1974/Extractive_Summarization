by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity2 had admitted that @entity3 will have to continue to support the @entity5 army ' long after 2014 ' , when @entity3 forces are officially due to withdraw			1
speaking at a press conference in the presidential palace , where @entity11 forces attacked last week , the prime minister admitted that @entity3 has paid ' a high price ' after 12 years of war			1
he said : ' while our combat troops will return home , we have already committed to support and sustain the @entity5 security forces with financial support long after 2014			1
' mr @entity2 said @entity3 ' has not made any commitments ' beyond the military academy but he did not rule out doing more and explicitly said @entity21 may well need to do more ' to assist @entity5 forces '			1
' i think of their families and friends			0
we have paid a high price but since @entity3 troops arrived here over a decade we have dramatically reduced the terror threat emanating from this region			2
' we came here to make @entity5 safer			0
and together we are achieving that			0
' earlier a senior military figure suggested that @entity3 troops will be in @entity5 until the end of the decade			1
despite the start of political reconciliation , a senior commander has conceded that @entity3 troops will have to stay for ' three to five years ' after the @entity3 ends combat operations in december 2014			1
that means @entity3 forces could still be in the war zone in december 2019			1
mr @entity2 visited the frontline to mark @entity62 and announce plans for a permanent @entity5 war memorial in the @entity3			1

but senior commanders have now admitted that @entity5 forces will need far more help than just training			2
@entity21 's follow - on mission will also have to help with medical evacuation , logistics , planning helicopter operations and integrating ground combat with close air support			0
army chiefs say the @entity5 military are now a match for the @entity11 on the battlefield , but lack the ability to run support operations properly			1
an @entity5 operation in @entity111 was abandoned recently because the brigade ran out of fuel			0
it is also likely that some @entity3 special forces will remain to conduct counter terrorist operations			2
the @entity3 currently has 7,900 troops in @entity5 and will fall to 5,200 by the end of 2013			1
the number of bases will fall from 11 to four or five by the end of the year			0
mr @entity2 's trip was designed to hail progress over the last 13 years			2

another £ 2.5million has been awarded to programmes supporting treatment and awareness of mental health issues for veterans			0
the plan will see an impromptu memorial built by troops at @entity31 flown home and incorporated into a permanent roll call of the dead back home			0
the new memorial will be erected in sand coloured stone over the next 18 months and dedicated once combat operations in @entity5 have ended			1
the money will come from banks fined over the libor scandal			0
the prime minister said : ' @entity3 must never forget those who gave their lives in @entity5			1
a @entity186 back at home deserves every penny of this funding			0
' it will give us a permanent place to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in @entity5 and to show how proud and thankful we are for all they gave serving our country			2

in an interview with the @entity213 newspaper , he said : ' back in 2002 , the @entity11 were on the run			0
' i think that at that stage , if we had been very prescient , we might have spotted that a final political solution to what started in 2001 , from our perspective , would have involved getting all @entity5 to sit at the table and talk about their future			0
' mr @entity2 agreed that talks with the @entity11 could have begun earlier			1
he said : ' i think you can argue about whether the settlement we put in place after 2001 could have been better arranged			0
' of course you can make that argument			0
since i became prime minister in 2010 i have been pushing all the time for a political process and that political process is now under way			2
' but at the same time i know that you can not bank on that which is why we have built up the @entity5 army , built up the @entity5 police , supported the @entity5 government so after our troops have left , and they will be leaving under the programme we have set out , this country should n't be a haven for terrorists			2
' troops could stay three to five years longer than previously announced , the official said ( file photo ) a senior @entity250 source said the @entity251 would have to decide whether @entity3 troops would play a wider role after 2015			1
the source said : ' the pm has been clear that we have paid a heavy price and already given a lot			0
' our combat troops will leave at the end of next year			0
the only military commitments we have made beyond 2014 are to part run the @entity261 and to provide financial support to sustain @entity5 forces			2
