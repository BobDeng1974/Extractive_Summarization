@entity1 forwards coach @entity0 has told @entity2 not to expect the same @entity4 mistakes made in @entity5 last year			1
@entity2 ran out convincing 26 - 3 winners when the two teams last met at the @entity8 in february 2014 but @entity0 admits the @entity4 management could have prepared the side better for that contest			1
and , with @entity2 's visit to the @entity13 on march 14 shaping up to be the game that could decide the destiny of this year 's @entity17 title , @entity0 insists @entity1 will be ready this time			1
@entity18 surges through for @entity2 as they beat @entity1 26 - 3 in last year 's tournament @entity1 forwards coach @entity0 has told @entity2 not to expect the same @entity4 mistakes as last year ' i know from a coaching point of view we looked at ourselves and were n't happy with the way we prepared for the game that week , ' @entity0 reflected on @entity1 ' visit to @entity2 13 months ago			1
' we did not have the intensity in training leading up to that match and we were exposed on the day			0
' we were n't pointing fingers , we were looking at ourselves as to how we could have prepared better for that game			2
' it was a bitter pill to swallow because we were well - beaten and it was the first time in a long time that had happened to us			0
' we really struggled to cope with their driving game but we 've worked worked hard in that area and the boys showed against @entity39 what they 're capable of doing			0
' @entity1 ' 20 - 13 victory in @entity42 has revived @entity4 hopes of doing what they did in 2013 , namely becoming @entity17 champions after losing their first game in the tournament and they were boosted on friday when skipper @entity49 and @entity50 returned to training after suffering knocks in @entity39			2
@entity1 captain @entity49 ( centre ) is expected to play against @entity2 after suffering a knock but @entity2 are three - fifths to a @entity56 having beaten @entity57 in @entity5 last weekend and @entity0 accepts @entity1 face a big challenge to record their first win over the men in green since 2012			1
' they 're a very formidable outfit as they 've proven , ' @entity0 said			2
' you 've got to have your wits about you playing them in regards to the tactical and technical approach to the game			0
' but the @entity39 game was a reflection of what the players have been doing in training and some of the execution and accuracy under pressure which we we speak about constantly came to fruition			0
' we 've set the standard and now we 've got to do it again			0
