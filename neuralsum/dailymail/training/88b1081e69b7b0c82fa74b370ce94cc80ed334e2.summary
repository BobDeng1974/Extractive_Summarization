the press room , @entity1 , 2pm , saturday 28 february 2015			1
that is where and when the team sheets for @entity5 's match with @entity6 will be handed out			1
it also when we may find out whether @entity10 has a future at the club			1
saturday could be one of @entity10 's final chances to prove himself against @entity6 at @entity1 the @entity5 striker has struggled for form since his £ 6million loan move to the @entity18 the @entity19 boasted a fantastic scoring record at @entity21 , scoring 52 goals in 68 appearances if he has made the starting xi the @entity19 has secured another chance			1
another chance to show why it would be a good idea for @entity30 to part with £ 43.2m to secure the services of the 29 - year - old permanently			0
another chance to reward @entity5 fans for their unwavering support			2
another chance to show us that the goalscoring machine who was once one of world football 's hottest properties is capable of returning to those dizzy heights after his second serious injury			0
if he is not on the list , then it would appear to be the end of the discussion			0
@entity10 could start for @entity5 on saturday following injuries to @entity51 ( pictured ) and @entity52 when @entity53 sits down to pen his line - up for the visit of @entity57 's luckless @entity6 he will not be able to select injured duo @entity51 and @entity52			1
the @entity59 will instead have to decide whether to play @entity61 upfront on his own or whether to give @entity10 , with all of four goals under his belt , the nod to start alongside him			2
his decision will tell us much			0
if @entity10 starts then maybe making that loan move permanent is still under consideration			0
if he does not , then super agent @entity68 might want to start calling those clubs he claimed would be only too happy to accommodate his man .			0

@entity5 face luckless @entity6 at @entity1 on saturday
if named in the squad @entity10 will have yet another point to prove
with just four goals since *joining* , @entity10 's @entity5 future is under *question*
if he is not selected it would appear the @entity19 could be on his way out
