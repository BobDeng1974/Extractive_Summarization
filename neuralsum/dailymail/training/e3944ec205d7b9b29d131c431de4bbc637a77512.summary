by @entity0 follow @ @ gedbrand10 @entity2 fans should be in little doubt			1
@entity5 ’s side will struggle to stay out of a relegation battle this term			2
despite pre-season spirits being higher than they should be - testament to an honest support whose expectations have sadly dropped to an all - time low – @entity2 are sixth favourites to be relegated from the @entity12 for the first time			1
in truth , that ’s generous			0
five years ago , @entity16 was a prerequisite at @entity18			0
now , the only desire is to stay alive while hoping the club is sold before long			0
a manager nobody wants but with no alternative			0
three consecutive seasons of failing to muster up more than 41 points			1
three signings you ’d be pleased with on the 2004 version of @entity39			0
just 15 @entity12 home wins out of a possible 57			2
and @entity41 is now involved to help steady the ship			2
their last three top flight finishes – 16th , 15th and 15th – suggests this could be the year			0
what ’s going for @entity2 ? history … and optimism			2
the last two factors do count for something			0
if @entity2 are to attract a buyer – at the £ 150million asking price or below – the club ’s proud past is a selling point			1
after all , that ’s what brought @entity57 to the @entity58 in the first place ( @entity2 finished 16th the season before the @entity62 ’s arrival ) ; the 26 consecutive years of top flight football and wide fan base does help			1
more importantly , optimism and positivity may see @entity2 through a fifth straight relegation dog fight			0
whether it 's token pre-season hope or real evidence of a change in fortunes on the horizon , @entity2 fans realise they desperately need to get behind the team again for a make - or - break season			1
helping hand ? former @entity79 and @entity80 boss @entity41 has been brought in as @entity5 's assistant the murmurs of discontent have calmed somewhat as we approach the equivalent of @entity2 's @entity86 , drawn out over 38 games			1
but the events of the summer have done little to convince us the club 's ever - present @entity12 tag will keep for another season			1
the signings @entity5 finally gave in to fans ’ cries when things got desperate last year by admitting the club needed experience , six months and a transfer window after the @entity18 had made that very observation			2
@entity5 moved quick this summer to bring in @entity99 ( 29 ) , @entity100 ( 29 ) and @entity21 ( 32 )			1
experience box ticked in one swoop			0
all three have something to prove , but hardly set fans ' imagination alight			0
know - how : @entity5 needed experience , and brought in 29 - year - olds @entity100 ( left ) and @entity99 ( right ) if all three had signed for a @entity111 side this summer , you would n't bat an eyelid			1
@entity21 in particular has bags of experience , but struggled in the @entity12 even during his romantic return to @entity116			1
his injury problems are a whole other issue - exactly what @entity2 do n't need			2
@entity99 is back - up and @entity100 could prove handy , but @entity2 's exit door is still open , with the futures of @entity123 and @entity124 still uncertain			1
there is a real possibility the team could be in worse shape than 12 months ago come september 2			0
something to prove : at 32 , @entity21 has been given another chance in the @entity12 the manager hands tied ? yes			1
a sticky situation ? certainly			0
but @entity5 has n't helped himself			0
home form must improve , and the criticisms of the @entity136 's lack of tactical awareness have been loud and understandable			0
this transfer window has been the polar opposite to his four previous , where @entity2 took gambles on youth			2
in drastically changing , @entity5 has admitted his previous faults in the market , and knows this is his final chance			2
it 's third time lucky in what should be his third and final season at @entity2			2
underperformed : @entity2 have won just 11 home league games under @entity5 , finishing 15th twice the assistant manager @entity41 has the potential to destroy morale as quickly as he raises it			1
appointing the @entity155 was @entity2 's riskiest move of the summer but the fear should give certain players a lift and separate the men from the boys			0
@entity123 and @entity162 could also learn a thing or two from one of the greatest central midfielders to have graced the game			0
but it is widely assumed , and rightly so , that if @entity5 is sacked at some point during the season , @entity41 will take over			1
again , that appointment could go either way			0
learn from the best : @entity123 ( left ) and @entity162 ( right ) could prosper under @entity41 's influence i 'm next : @entity41 is @entity2 's realistic replacement if @entity5 loses him job during the course of the season the owner when @entity2 were put on the market in may , it was naive to expect a quick takeover before the new season			1
attaining a club is more than a swing by the corner shop			0
but @entity57 ca n't even get out of the front door and pass the first hurdle ; finding a suitable buyer			1
@entity57 wishes to hand over the club to a chairman with the same intentions as himself ; healthy , sustainable investment without ruining the identity of the club			2
patience is key here , but if another six months passes with no movement , the @entity62 may sell to anybody			0
attractive : @entity2 's proud history and tradition should entice buyers , but that has n't been the case as yet flog it : @entity57 has struggled to find a suitable buyer for the club , despite reducing the asking price the bomb squad @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 are back in the fold after being all but ignored by @entity5			1
@entity2 are desperate , and the experience of the three - whose transfer fees total £ 38m - is something the @entity136 sees as beneficial to a young squad			1
he even allowed @entity216 to become his right - hand man towards the end of last season , despite the @entity155 goalkeeper earlier admitting the club previously wanted him out the door			2
second chances have been handed out and the slate is so clean @entity5 can see his own face in it			0
but @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 have big egos			0
while all is forgiven now , a few defeats down the line the situation could turn sour			0
assistant @entity41 still has one of the biggest attitudes in football - allowing him to get stuck in to high - earners moping around @entity236 could equal disaster			1
look who 's back : @entity209 ( left ) and @entity208 ( right ) are seemingly back in @entity5 's plans carrying a grudge ? record signing @entity207 should be given a chance for @entity2 this term			1

@entity5 prepares for his third season in charge at @entity2 having finished 15th in previous two terms
the @entity58 club have failed to pass 41 points for the past three seasons
villa at risk of losing their ever - present status in the @entity12
owner @entity57 put @entity2 up for sale in may , but is yet to find a buyer
@entity5 has signed @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity21
@entity41 was also appointed assistant manager , and is a realistic replacement for @entity5 if the @entity136 loses his job
