by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter four years after a trainer was drowned and dismembered by a killer whale at @entity6 , employees are being made to wear safety vests			1
but critics believe the jackets still would n't save lives in a confrontation with one of the ocean predators			0
@entity6 trainers started wearing the new inflatable safety vests on monday , which marine park officials say took three years to develop			1
the slim jackets are inflatable and even include a small oxygen tank which can buy a trainer a few minutes of breathing if dragged underwater			1
the jackets are just one of many new safety measures instituted by the park after the february 24 , 2020 death of trainer @entity27			2
since @entity27 's death , trainers have been unable to get into the water with the killer whales amid calls for new safety measures			1
@entity51 , @entity6 's curator of animal training , refused to speculate on whether the new vests would have saved @entity27 's life , but @entity55 , author of ' death at @entity6 ' , offered up his negative opinion			1
he told @entity58 that the vest ' would not have saved any of the trainers who were killed by orcas			2
@entity64 was rammed and dismember by @entity39 , a vest and spare air would have been useless			0
' he also points out that the vests are dangerous as well , and could give trainers the bends if they were using the oxygen tank and suddenly pushed to the surface by one of the whales			2
tragedy : the new safety measures come four years after the death of trainer @entity27 , who was dismembered after being dragged underwater by a killer whale named @entity39 other safety changes include remotely controlled pool gates , new walkways around @entity40 and an additional raised platform in an orca pool that could be used to lift a whale out of the water should a trainer fall in			1
but the vests are probably the most visible change that park visitors will notice , she said			0
the start of using the vests had nothing to do with an appellate court 's recent decision upholding a ruling that @entity6 had violated a federal workplace safety law , @entity51 added			1
earlier this month , that appellate court in @entity96 upheld a regulatory safety finding against @entity6 by the @entity98 following an investigation into @entity27 's drowning			2
the court said @entity6 had exposed trainers to recognized hazards when working in close contact with killer whales during performances			1
currently , trainers are not allowed in the water with the orcas , and must remain 18 inches away from the whales while standing and three feet while kneeling			2
@entity111 says the new jackets are n't a part of a ploy to get trainers back into the pool for shows			0
' right now , that 's not something we 're even considering			0
this is just a piece of equipment to maybe make that environment a little bit safer , ' @entity111 told @entity126			0
the dark side of @entity6 : after @entity27 's death , @entity39 became the subject of an @entity131 documentary about deaths at the park			1
the film argues that killer whales in captivity become more aggressive to humans and each other known danger : the whale @entity39 had been involved in two other deaths when trainer @entity27 was dragged underwater by him during a show @entity39 subsequently became the focus of the 2013 documentary film ' @entity146 , ' which explores what may have caused @entity39 to kill @entity27			1
the documentary argues that killer whales , when in captivity , become more aggressive to humans and each other			0
since the documentary , several entertainers have pulled out of planned performances at @entity156 parks			0
' the two things happened in completely different silos , ' @entity51 said of the ruling and the use of the vests			0
' the team was close to complete before the ruling			0

trainers at @entity6 's marine parks started wearing the new custom - designed safety vests on monday
the life vests are inflatable and also come with a small pack of oxygen
just the latest safety measure added to parks after trainer was killed by killer whale named @entity39 four years *ago*
