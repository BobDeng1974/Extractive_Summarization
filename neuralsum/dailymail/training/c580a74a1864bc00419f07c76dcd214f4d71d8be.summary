@entity0 is fit enough to withstand the rigours of the @entity2 and is ready to give his all for @entity4 , according to his wife , @entity5			1
@entity4 manager @entity6 's is becoming increasingly frustrated at not having his striker fully fit and that was evident at the weekend			2
@entity9 said @entity0 was in the squad for the match at @entity12 on monday ' in spite of the fact he can only play 20 minutes at this level because the rhythm of the game in the @entity2 is the highest			1
' @entity0 's wife , @entity5 , uploaded the above image of her husband training at @entity4 @entity6 had previously said that @entity0 was only ready to play 20 minutes a game for @entity4 @entity0 ( centre ) made a substitute appearance in the 78th minute in @entity4 's last match against @entity26 but the @entity29 centre forward 's wife @entity30 went on her @entity32 account to pour scorn on @entity9 's assertion			1
alongside a picture of @entity0 in @entity4 training attire the caption read simply : ' 100 % ready to give everything ! ! ! ' @entity0 has yet to discover the prodigious goalscoring touch he is renowned for , finding the net only once in seven appearances at @entity4			1
he came on as a 78th - minute substitute during their last match , the home victory over @entity26			0
but if monday 's game at @entity48 's sees @entity4 's resurgence continue with their fifth consecutive win , they will move above @entity12 and into third in the @entity2			2
however , if @entity0 does play a part he will be up against the top - flight 's best defence			0
@entity12 have conceded a measly 10 @entity2 goals , thanks to a back four who have barely changed all season			0
so @entity59 and @entity60 are likely to be the centre halves against whom @entity0 is likely to line up			0
and then @entity9 will have a better idea of how ready the @entity65 star is .			0

@entity4 play @entity12 in the @entity2 on monday
manager @entity6 says @entity0 ' can only play 20 minutes '
but @entity0 's wife posts on @entity32 saying he is ' 100 % ready '
