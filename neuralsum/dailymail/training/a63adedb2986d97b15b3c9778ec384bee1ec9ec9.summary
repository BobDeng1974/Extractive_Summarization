@entity0 have their swagger back and are charging towards claiming a place in next season 's @entity3			1
their latest victory at @entity6 , which has put them within touching distance of the top four , showed them to be resilient , confident and organised – a far cry from when their season looked as if it might combust in november			1
but how has it all turned around ? here @entity14 examines the key areas that have been crucial in the @entity17 ' revival			0
@entity0 's 2 - 0 win at @entity6 , where @entity19 ( above ) scored the second after a superb early opener from @entity22 , has seen them gain momentum in the race for a top - four finish @entity0 are currently sixth in the league table with 45 points , two behind @entity28 in fourth the @entity17 were in ninth place on @entity31 ( left ) but have since gone on a superb run to climb the table all about the system during the depths of @entity0 's bad run in the autumn , when they were losing games and looking distinctly ordinary , @entity35 had a number of nights when , unable to sleep , he ended up pacing the floor of his kitchen trying to find a remedy for his team 's ills			1
the bold decision to switch to 3 - 4 - 3 from 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 has transformed @entity0			1
though they lost the first game in which it was deployed – 3 - 0 at @entity28 on december 14 – they are been unbeaten in the subsequent 10 @entity51 fixtures , winning seven and drawing three			1
it was a brave call			0
@entity35 was under scrutiny and had it backfired , the criticism would have intensified			1
but the courage he had in his convictions has reaped dividends			0
the way the team is set up also allows some who had previously looked uncomfortable , such as @entity62 and @entity63 , to flourish			2
@entity0 boss @entity35 made a bold call in switching his team 's formation to 3 - 4 - 3 from 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 playing with three centre backs has helped @entity0 to improve their defensive record a golden gloves contender had you suggested in november @entity71 would head into spring as being in the running for the @entity51 's top goalkeeper award , you would have been laughed out of town			1
@entity0 's defending was miserable and their no 1 's confidence was shot			2
the transformation , however , has been remarkable			2
@entity71 has emerged from a spell in the wilderness and his shutout at @entity81 's was his 10th of the campaign – two behind @entity84 , who leads the @entity86 race			2
in front of him , the chemistry between @entity88 , @entity87 and @entity62 is also right and that has enabled them to become a tighter unit , with no goals conceded away from home in their last five games			0
it is a feat that was last achieved in the 1984 - 85 campaign			2
@entity35 was asked when @entity0 were shipping so many goals whether he would bring in a defensive coach			1
his brusque answer was ' no. no. no chance			0
no. ' the faith he had in his ability and methods is being proven right			0
goalkeeper @entity71 has experienced a huge upturn in form after a stuttering start to the season @entity71 has kept 10 clean sheets in the @entity51 this season ; only @entity84 has kept more @entity0 have not conceded a goal in their last five successive away games in the @entity51 new faces playing like old hands the criticism which came @entity0 's way over their summer transfer policy was ferocious when results plummeted			1
during this impressive run , though , the emergence of can , @entity63 and @entity121 – combined cost £ 43million – has been noticeable			0
can , especially , looks a footballer of the highest calibre			0
a number of clubs , including @entity28 , scouted him last season and it was felt @entity0 had made a shrewd acquisition when they secured his signature			1
he is over his early teething troubles			0
whether he is liked or loathed , this point must be made			0
@entity0 looked at signing @entity136 last summer and he was the preferred option ahead of @entity134 , a star name to fill @entity140 's void			2
@entity134 has not done a massive amount at @entity142 but how crucial might the winner he scored against @entity144 two weeks ago prove to be ? whereas @entity136 looks woefully out of sorts and expensive failed gamble , it could turn out that @entity134 has scored the defining goal in the top - four race			2
@entity121 joined @entity0 last summer from @entity150 for a reported £ 20million fee the @entity152 to see @entity22 play earlier in the year tested the patience			1
a player with wonderful ability , he was not having anywhere near the desired impact , flitting out of games , never imposing himself away from home and looking flimsy			0
the change since has been remarkable			0
@entity22 has confessed to doing extra training and in recent weeks he created both goals in a 2 - 0 win against @entity164 , scored a stunning goal at @entity166 in the @entity167 and then trumped it with a magnificent effort at @entity6			1
@entity35 believes he can be @entity0 's @entity170			1
given the way he is playing , there is no reason to doubt that ca n't scale those heights			0
@entity22 is rapidly maturing into a very accomplished playmaker for @entity0 all in it together one thing which particularly incensed @entity35 when results dipped was the accusation that @entity0 's dressing room was fractured			1
he prides himself on having a tight group without cliques and wants to create a working environment with an atmosphere that allows players to thrive			0
you can see how close the group is now judging by the way they have been celebrating goals in recent weeks			0
whoever has scored , be it @entity192 at @entity193 or @entity194 at @entity81 's , the players have joined in en masse			0
@entity196 even leapt into the crowd at @entity198			0
they are all , clearly , pulling in the same direction and that unity will be crucial if @entity0 are going to see the job through and qualify for the @entity3			2
difficult assignments loom in the next six weeks but , at present , @entity0 have the form and confidence to meet them head on			1
@entity35 has done well to ensure that the morale in @entity0 's dressing room has not dropped			1

@entity0 have improved *dramatically* since their slow start to the season
their win at @entity6 sees them within touching distance of top four
@entity35 has made a bold *tactical* decision switching to 3 - 4 - 3
keeper @entity71 has experienced a remarkable upturn in form
@entity220 is maturing into an accomplished playmaker
