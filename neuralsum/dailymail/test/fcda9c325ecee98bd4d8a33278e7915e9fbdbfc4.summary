@entity0 is looking forward to this weekend 's ' special ' match against @entity2 , ahead of which the @entity4 manager praised the ' great job ' predecessor @entity5 did at @entity7 's			1
the former @entity9 defender ended a 16 - month stint on the south coast last summer to sign a five - year deal at @entity13			1
@entity5 's exit was the catalyst to an unparalleled talent drain from @entity7 's , although successor @entity0 has not only steered the club to calmer waters but to new heights			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 has praised the work of his predecessor @entity5 at the club @entity5 ( left ) managed @entity4 between 2013 and 2014 before leaving for @entity2 @entity4 full - back @entity22 ( left ) tussles for possession with @entity27 's @entity26 ( right ) @entity27 forward @entity28 dribbles ahead of @entity4 's @entity29 ( right ) in their last game @entity0 had to cope with several player sales at @entity4 , including @entity32 to @entity33 attacking midfielder @entity34 ( right ) was also sold to @entity35 shortly after @entity0 arrived at the club with five matches remaining , @entity4 are just a point and a place worse off than @entity2 in sixth and can usurp them in the @entity41 spots with victory in saturday 's early kick - off			1
' everybody was afraid because we had to make a lot of changes in the team , ' @entity0 told reporters			0
' but i think the quality of the players that we brought in were good , at a good level			0
i think the rest of the players had really a good aspiration and ambition to do a good season , to play a good season at a good level			0
' now we are fighting for a high position in the table			0
there 's still five games to play and a very nice one this saturday afternoon			0
' it is @entity2 , the difference is only one point and , okay , for the fans maybe it makes it a little bit more special because @entity5 is now the coach and was the coach of @entity4			1
' he is the coach of the opponent this saturday , so that makes it special but the game will be decided between the white lines			0
' @entity0 was speaking at @entity7 's after meeting @entity79 hero @entity78 , who was being rewarded for her community work at the club			2
the @entity4 manager and midfielder @entity82 answered questions from a handful of supporters as part of the event , where talk of @entity5 was rarely far away			1
@entity0 says his return along with the potential implications of the result makes saturday 's match the biggest at @entity7 's since he took the reins			0
a positive result would see @entity4 break their record @entity97 points haul set last year by @entity5 , although he is unlikely to get a particularly warm reception			1
the former @entity9 defender 's departure left a sour taste with many @entity4 fans , whose travelling support gave him a taster of what to expect at @entity13 earlier in the season			2
' sometimes if you go as a @entity111 player to @entity112 the reception is difficult , and sometimes in @entity113 , ' @entity0 said , when asked if he has such a bad reception			0
' but , okay , i think the reception for @entity5 normally has to be good because he did a great job for @entity4			1
' i like him as a person and as a coach and we have a good contact			0
' @entity4 midfielder @entity82 ( centre ) shields the ball from @entity125 players back in september there certainly does not appear any bad blood between @entity0 and @entity5 , despite the latter suggesting earlier in the year that he handed the @entity129 an easy job at @entity4			1
@entity0 took those comments in his stride , joking at the time that he only came to @entity4 ' to have a nice little holiday '			2
now , just days before the game , the @entity4 boss gave a more serious answer , praising his @entity2 counterpart for the legacy he left at @entity7 's			1
' i think they make the beginning ( of this ) and developed the quality of the players , the young players , ' @entity0 said			2
' i think the structure and organisation in the team , the spirit of the players starts under @entity5			2
' i took that over and maybe we were different in some details			0
from what i heard , maybe i try to do more training sessions with the ball and maybe he was a little bit more physical			0
' i think the start , for the development of the team , was under @entity5 and he did a great job last season			1
' we continue ( that ) and so far we made it a little bit better than it was , but that is all about the experience and quality of the players			0
' @entity170 scores @entity2 's third goal in their 3 - 1 win over @entity173 , which sees them fifth in the table @entity2 midfielder @entity176 ( left ) tussles for possession with @entity173 's @entity179 ( right )			2

@entity0 took over @entity4 last summer after @entity5 left for @entity2
@entity0 has praised his predecessor for the ' great job ' he did on the south coast , although had to cope with a mass *exodus* of players when he arrived
the @entity129 has actually managed to improve things @entity4 and the club find themselves just one point and one league place behind @entity2 now
both sides have ambitions of qualifying for @entity41 *competition* next term
