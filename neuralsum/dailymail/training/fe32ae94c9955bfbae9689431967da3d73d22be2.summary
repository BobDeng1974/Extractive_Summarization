@entity1 engineering director and futurist @entity0 believes we are close to realizing everlasting life and is dead - set on getting us there			1
the inventor and noted author believes the key to such a scientific breakthrough is a system of ' bridges ' that enable the body to move from strength to strength over time			2
the youthful 65 - year - old currently takes 150 supplements a day , which he argues if the first bridge			1
the idea is to build enough bridges to ensure the body holds out long enough for life - lengthening technology to come into its own			1
he has likened the biology of the body to computer software and believes we are all ' out of date '			1
@entity28 : @entity0 , futurist and @entity1 engineering director , says the biology of the body is much like computer software and that we are in need of of an upgrade			1
the hope is to go along enough ' bridges ' , or stages , to reach the point where life - lengthening technology is at its greatest bridge number one : staying as healthy as possible			1
@entity0 currently takes 150 supplements a day to keep his body at its peak in an interview with @entity45 magazine @entity44 , @entity0 says he hopes the supplements will keep him healthy enough to reach the ' nanotech revolution '			1
' i can never say , “ i ’ve done it , i ’ve lived forever , ” because it ’s never forever , ' he said			0
' we ’re really talking about being on a path that will get us to the next point			0
' bridge one : stay as healthy as possible with diet and exercise and current medicine			2
' the goal is to get to bridge two			0
' bridge two ( is ) the biotechnology revolution , where we can reprogram biology away from disease			2
' and that is not the end - all either			0
' bridge three is to go beyond biology , to the nanotechnology revolution			2
' at that point we can have little robots , sometimes called nanobots , that augment your immune system			1
' we can create an immune system that recognizes all disease , and if a new disease emerged , it could be reprogrammed to deal with new pathogens			1
' such robots , according to @entity0 , will help fight diseases , improve health and allow people to remain active for longer			1
genius : @entity0 is considered a revolutionary in his field and is currently working on @entity85 ' biology is a software process , ' @entity0 told @entity88 's			1
' our bodies are made up of trillions of cells , each governed by this process			0
' you and i are walking around with outdated software running in our bodies , which evolved in a very different era			0
' we each have a fat insulin receptor gene that says , “ hold on to every calorie ”			0
' that was a very good idea 10,000 years ago , when you worked all day to get a few calories ; there were no refrigerators , so you stored them in your fat cells			0
' i would like to tell my fat insulin receptor gene , “ you do n’t need to do that anymore , ”			0
' @entity0 referenced a lab mice experiment at the @entity110 , which managed to turn off the mice 's fat insulin receptor gene			2
the mice continued to eat , remained slim , did not get diabetes or heart disease and lived 20 per cent longer			0
@entity1 is hoping to help expand the human lifespan with its new company @entity117 , which aims to make improvements in human health and well - being			0
@entity0 has previously predicted that by the late 2020s humans will be able to eat as much junk food as they want because everyone will have a nanobot injected into their bodies that will provide all the necessary nutrients while simultaneously eliminating fat			2
@entity0 is current work towards building smarter computers is being seen as the first step towards developing such technology			1
his goal is to improve the natural language processing skills in computers that will allow robots to read , consume and understand human communication			0
@entity0 believes creating intelligent robots is key to human evolution			2
leading the way : @entity1 is hoping to help expand the human lifespan with its new company @entity117 , which aims to make improvements in human health and well - being .			0

futurist @entity0 *explains* the biology of the body is like computer software that needs upgrading
@entity149 is a ' bridge to bridge ' system where you *maximize* current *methods* in order to live until life - lengthening technology is at its greatest
@entity0 is currently taking 150 *vitamin* supplements per day
we will eventually hit a stage where robots will *subsidize* our immune system
