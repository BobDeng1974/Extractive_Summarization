it was arguably the hottest sporting ticket of all time			0
and @entity3 ’s high society stalwarts did n’t disappoint as they begged , borrowed and charmed their way into @entity5 yesterday to watch @entity7 ’s quest for glory			1
there was a prime minister , a former @entity12 football captain and even a @entity13			0
but it was , perhaps inevitably , the impeccably dressed @entity16 sisters who stole the show			1
@entity18 , with their glossy brunette blow - dries styled to perfection , they were greeted with wolf whistles and cheers as they entered the @entity25			1
@entity31 looked as impossibly chic as ever in a cream @entity38 of the £ 480 ‘ @entity49 ’ tweed jacket , which debuted last year at the @entity41 , and a £ 275 crepe shift ‘ @entity48 ’ dress which she bought for last summer ’s @entity47 tour			1
@entity16 , ever the more fashion - forward , went for a @entity51 £ 350 ‘ @entity57 ’ frock decorated with bluebirds and designed by @entity53 and @entity54 and shoes by @entity56			1
big fashion ticks for both the peplum style and the on - trend print			2
but more importantly , and most engagingly , as keen tennis fans they seemed delighted at being able to watch such a nail - biting match live			2
looking good : come on @entity7 ! the @entity16 sisters look confident - and delighted at their front row seats he 'll do it : both now wearing sunglasses , @entity31 and @entity16 are clearly being dazzled by @entity7 's feisty play , or perhaps it was a rare spell of sunshine ? he will do it ... wo n't he ? @entity16 's seeming a bit concerned , but her sister appears to have comforting words that was close ! the @entity33 tensely clasps her hands but @entity16 's smile suggests the action , on this occasion , went @entity7 's way even when some wag yelled from the crowd , ‘ i love you , @entity16 ’ , she was too engrossed to register			1
it was left to her sister to relay the information , at which both girls suffered an attack of the giggles			2
as the dramatic match see - sawed towards first @entity7 and then @entity29 , they ‘ ooo - ed ’ and ‘ aahh - ed ’ with excitement and trepidation			1
their faces mirrored the tense emotion felt by the whole @entity5 crowd and , when @entity29 finally prevailed , @entity31 , 30 , clapped enthusiastically			1
but even she , doe - eyes downcast in an attempt to control her emotions , had to bite her wobbling lip when @entity7 ’s tears seemed to dissolve everyone else			1
their parents , @entity107 and @entity108 , were also there – in debenture seats courtesy of their friends @entity114 and @entity115 ( parents of @entity117 ) , with whom they play tennis			0
@entity107 donned a stylish blue ensemble by @entity56 , while @entity108 looked smart in chinos and a blue shirt			0
family affair : @entity31 's mother @entity123 and father @entity108 arrive at a rainy @entity124 earlier today treading carefully : clutching a leopard skin bag and sunglasses @entity31 heads to her seat followed by @entity16 brushing up : @entity31 , left , and @entity16 , right , keep their hair out of their eyes as they head to their seats in the @entity25 at @entity124 emotional : smiles , claps and flustered expressions as @entity31 takes shows the rollercoaster of watching @entity7 in the @entity124 final on her face meanwhile , other members of the aristocracy were putting the ‘ royal ’ into the 76 - seat @entity25			1
prince @entity108 was there , with his indomitable wife @entity144 , in his role as president of the @entity147 and trophy - presenter in chief			0
lord @entity150 and his actress wife @entity151 sprinkled some @entity153 stardust but , along with the @entity154 , were turfed out of their normal front - row seats in favour of @entity31 and @entity16			1
the political class was also well represented			0
@entity160 first minister @entity159 had managed to bag one of the plum seats			0
next to him and his wife @entity162 was @entity164 mayor @entity163 ( who cheered and harumped loudly ) with wife @entity165			0
prime minister @entity166 and @entity164 mayor @entity163 as @entity7 slips to defeat in the fourth and final set completing the line - up was @entity169 , whose tennis - playing opponents have sometimes landed him in a political tight spot – whether it be @entity166 or @entity175 lobbyist @entity174			1
and the @entity25 would n’t have been complete without the prime minister himself , who brought his mother @entity178 instead of @entity179			2
an avid tennis player , he joined in the ferocious clapping and yelling of @entity7 ’s name			2
elsewhere in @entity5 were various celebrities from the world of sport , showbusiness and music			0
@entity189 was there with his wife @entity191 , as was @entity193 manager @entity192 spotted in the stands were the @entity195 , actor @entity196 , dr who star @entity197 and @entity198 and girlfriend @entity199			0
and of course it would n’t have been @entity124 without sir @entity202			0
although not in the @entity25 this year , he ensured he did n’t go unnoticed thanks to his particularly atrocious @entity205 jacket			1
quick getaway : @entity31 and @entity16 make their exit from centre court following the match in the driving seat : @entity31 takes the wheel of her @entity213 as the two sisters drive away leaving : the siblings outside @entity5 as they depart @entity124 following @entity7 's final heartbreak sleek : @entity33 of @entity34 's £ 275 crepe shift dress was previously donned on the @entity47 tour with her husband last year @entity221 : @entity31 wore a pair of £ 495 gold and citrine earrings by @entity226 - the same pair she wore last week to watch @entity228 installed into the @entity229 striking : the @entity226 citrine drop earrings , as worn by the @entity31 wild : @entity31 's leopard - print clutch bag is a @entity235 piece , another item recycled from her @entity47 tour wardrobe of last july summery : @entity16 wore a bluebird print peplum dress by @entity51 , the label designed by @entity53 and @entity54 a @entity242 spokesman also revealed the @entity243 had kept the weekend free of engagements following her recent trip to @entity160			1
the spokesman said : ' @entity243 keeps up to date with the news and reads the newspapers , so she 's seen @entity7 's progress			2
' however , prince @entity228 had a prior commitment and was not in the crowd			0
ticket prices for the final soared with online ticket marketplace @entity253 saying the average ticket sale price jumped from £ 3 - 4,000 to an average of £ 5 - 6,000			2
it was in 1938 that a @entity257 , @entity258 , last made it to the men ’s final at @entity124			0
eleven others have fallen at the semi-final stage since then , with @entity7 having lost in that round for the last three years on the trot			2
