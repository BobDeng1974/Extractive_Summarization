the waiting is over , the @entity1 is finally here			1
@entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 – the @entity26			2
flair by name and deed			2
step forward the class of 2014 , step forward @entity30 and , er , @entity31			2
there ’s a chap named @entity34 on their bench as well			2
truth be told , little @entity31 is a real dazzler and is believed to be on the radars of @entity39 and @entity40			2
if the name does n’t get pulses racing , @entity42 ’s £ 30m valuation might			0
ear we go : @entity30 is set to lead @entity48 's line when they kick off the tournament against @entity51 2 ) shaving foam on the pitch it ’s 1974 , @entity48 have a free - kick 25 yards from @entity56 ’s goal			1
the referee ’s whistle blows and from the @entity56 wall @entity59 comes charging , kicking away the stationary ball			0
forty years later , the gently simmering issue of encroachment might finally have been dealt with			2
referees will use vanishing spray in the @entity1 for the first time this summer , drawing a foamy circle around the ball and a line 10 yards away to keep that pesky wall at bay			1
we are informed the spray is non-toxic , water - based and designed to fade from the pitch after a minute			0
making their mark : referees will spray foam on the pitch to indicate how far defensive walls should retreat 3 ) @entity80 the turtle there ’s a turtle sanctuary north of @entity84 where @entity80 the loggerhead is channelling the cosmos ( probably ) to make predictions for each game			0
it ’s a bit like that octopus in @entity92 , but a turtle			0
the 25 - year - old is predicting the results by choosing one of three fish , with a fish representing each of the teams in a given fixture and a third fish representing a draw			0
@entity80 initially appeared to back @entity48 - @entity51 to end in a draw , but slowly turned away and crawled purposefully , menacingly to the @entity14 fish , which he devoured			0
confident : @entity80 the turtle says @entity48 are going to win the @entity1 4 ) goal - line technology soon there will be nothing to gripe about or dissect and football can be at peace			1
this @entity1 ought to signal the end of goal - line controversies			1
@entity114 company @entity113 has focussed seven high - speed cameras on each goalmouth from the roofs of all 12 stadiums			0
if a ball crosses the line , the referee 's watch will vibrate and the word ‘ goal ’ will appear on his screen within a second			2
within five seconds of this happening in an @entity130 match , tv pictures will cut away to @entity132 ’s reaction			1
no goal : mistakes such as the one which saw @entity132 's goal against @entity137 in 2010 not awarded should be a thing of the past with goal - line technology introduced 5 ) @entity130 win a penalty shootout in a world where turtles predict football results , stranger things have happened			1
however , the numbers actually indicate @entity130 are less likely to win a shootout in the @entity1 than elsewhere , with all three of their previous attempts ending in defeat with a conversion rate of only 50 per cent ( seven scored , seven missed )			1
if you factor in the @entity152 , where @entity130 beat @entity153 in 1996 , @entity130 have won one of six shootouts , with a 68 per cent conversion rate ( 21 scored , 10 missed )			1
this time , of course , they have @entity158 strengthening the minds and training sessions where they have kicked penalties into open nets			0
cue second - round pandemonium when @entity130 knock out @entity164 on penalties and @entity166 , dandruff free , holds @entity158 aloft , while players mimic their inner chimps in the background			1
despair : @entity172 ( right ) is comforted by @entity173 after missing a penalty in @entity130 's defeat to @entity137 in 1990 6 ) an @entity177 team reaches the semi-final			1
maybe it ’s never happened before , with the quarter - finals previously claiming @entity181 ( 1990 ) , @entity182 ( 2002 ) and @entity183 in 2010			0
the draw has not offered any glaring opportunities to do better this time , with only @entity186 in @entity187 and @entity188 in @entity189 holding realistic chances of progression from the first round			0
@entity188 might fancy their second - round chances against the winners or runners up of a modest @entity197 , while @entity186 would take on a side from @entity130 ’s group			1
@entity188 : can @entity200 ( left ) help inspire @entity188 in @entity48 ? 7 ) the world loves @entity202 @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 etc. @entity202 are no longer only the hipster ’s choice			0
they have an easy group but will likely face either @entity137 or @entity21 in the second round			0
red alert : @entity202 are the outside bet of many punters 8 ) a @entity217 goal eight years after his first attempt , and four years after @entity221 ’s ‘ @entity222 ’ campaign hinted he might end up in a caravan , @entity217 is yet to do at a @entity1 that thing strikers are meant to do			1
this time , with pressure and expectation at an all - time low , can he do it ? or is his move into a @entity231 drawing closer ? @entity232 to climb : @entity217 has never scored a goal at the @entity1 finals 9 ) @entity235 after @entity130 ’s impressive run to the quarter - finals , the glow fades and radio debate analyses what went wrong			1
after some discussion on the merits of playing at least three passes in the control zone , it is quickly agreed that passion was the problem			0
overpaid players do n't want it enough			0
passion play : can @entity251 and @entity217 succeed where they have failed in previous tournaments ? 10 ) @entity255 in @entity255 @entity256 has made enough forays into television for his transition into pundit to be nothing too out of the ordinary			1
however , unlike @entity255 ’s @entity264 , it ’s unlikely that he ’ll be teaming up with the @entity265 to ‘ @entity266 ’			0
he tweeted on thursday that he will be kicking off his @entity1 by watching @entity48 - @entity51 at the home of @entity268 and @entity269			1
on the ball : @entity256 will be on the sofa as part of the @entity274 punditry team			2

@entity130 will win a penalty shootout
@entity217 will finally score a @entity1 goal
and an @entity177 team will reach the semi-finals
