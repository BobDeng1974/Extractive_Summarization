@entity1 star @entity0 has called for shorter seasons in the @entity3 to reduce the risk of serious injury			1
the @entity3 are experimenting with shorter quarters - reducing their duration from 12 minutes to 11 minutes - following claims that players are being over-played			1
but @entity0 believes that is not the solution , with the @entity13 calling for fewer games , rather than shorter games , to resolve the issue			1
@entity1 forward @entity0 ( 23 ) drives against @entity18 forward @entity19 ( 9 ) @entity1 forward @entity0 gestures from the bench against the @entity18 ' @entity21 is less concessions and less tickets and all that , but at the end of the day we want to protect the prize , and the prize is the players , ' @entity0 told @entity28			1
' if guys are being injured because there ’s so many games , we ca n’t promote it at a high level			2
' he added : ' the minutes do n’t mean anything			2
we could play 50 - minute games if we had to			0
once you go out and play on the floor it does n’t matter if you ’re playing 22 minutes or 40 minutes			0
once you play it takes a toll on your body			0

we do n't really have to worry about concussions and some of the physical damage that football players deal with after they retire			1
