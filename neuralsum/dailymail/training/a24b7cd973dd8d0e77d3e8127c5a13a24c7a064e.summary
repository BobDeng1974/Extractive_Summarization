by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 05:34 est , 10 march 2013 he was one on the most closely guarded prisoners of all time , with a strong @entity5 squadron of 11 ships patrolling the @entity8 island where he was kept 1,200 miles from the nearest land			0
plots to rescue the @entity13 emperor @entity12 included those using yachts , steamboats and even balloons , but the most extraordinary of all of them was said to have involved a submarine			1
@entity21 , who was born in 1772 and had worked as a smuggler since the age of 12 , claimed he was offered £ 40,000 in 1820 to rescue @entity12 from exile on @entity25 , it was reported on friday			1
@entity27 's plan : @entity21 ( left ) , who was born in 1772 and had worked as a smuggler since the age of 12 , claimed he was offered £ 40,000 in 1820 to rescue @entity12 ( right , in exile on @entity25 ) , it has been reported the fascinating escape plan was to have @entity12 sat in a boatswain 's chair and taken down a sheer cliff to two primitive submarines , according to an essay in the @entity37 @entity36			1
@entity12 , who was exiled to @entity38 , @entity39 , after defeat in 1814 , escaped and returned to @entity13 before being beaten again at the @entity41 in 1815 and imprisoned by the @entity42 on @entity25			1
but @entity12 was supported by @entity43 , which was backed by him when it was trying to gain independence from @entity45 , and he had ambitions of launching a new empire in @entity48 or @entity49			0
' @entity12 ’s political ambition was not subdued by his captivity , ' historian @entity50 wrote , reported @entity36			0
' and his determined followers never abandoned hopes of setting him free			0
' underwater : @entity57 's submarine from 1806 , which is believed to be the inspiration for @entity21 's designs and has many similarities to the smuggler 's crafts the escape plans were hatched despite @entity12 being confined to an astonishing secure prison for the era , which was guarded by 2,800 men and 500 cannon on its handful of possible landing ports			1
an account from 1835 explains how @entity21 would have landed with a ‘ mechanical chair , capable of containing one person on the seat , and a standing foot - board at the back ’			1
@entity21 would have scaled the cliffs , put an iron bolt and block at the summit and then made his way to the @entity82 estate			0
there both he and @entity12 would have put on uniforms to make them appear to be with a coachman and escaped at night			0
they would then both come back down the cliff on the chair , where @entity12 would board the @entity90 and then be transferred to the @entity91			2
he spent six years on the heavily - guarded island , in the refurbished @entity82 mansion , where visitors were thoroughly questioned and searched , before dying in may 1821 , apparently of cancer , reported @entity36			1
an account of @entity21 ’s plan was uncovered in an 1835 memoir , which described the 114 - ton and 84ft - long steam - powered @entity91 submarine , along with the 23 - ton and 44ft - long @entity90			2
the vessels were manned by 30 seaman and four engineers , and armed with 20 primitive torpedoes , which were said to have been enough to destroy that number of ships			0
@entity21 ’s story is supported by other sources , with one from 1823 saying that he had earlier worked with @entity37 engineer @entity57 , who was selling plans for an underwater boat			0
an illustration of an 1806 craft @entity57 designed had many similarities to @entity21 ’s submarines , and @entity57 had also created a small experimental craft for the @entity13 in 1800 , which was successful			2
looking out : @entity12 is pictured on @entity25 in this painting by @entity118 - @entity117			2
he spent six years on the heavily - guarded island , in the refurbished @entity82 mansion it 's known that @entity21 possessed a real submarine in 1820 but it ’s not believed that @entity12 knew anything of the rescue plan being considered , reported @entity36			1
' @entity12 's political ambition was not subdued by his captivity			0
and his determined followers never abandoned hopes of setting him free ' @entity50 , historian in fact , it ’s also thought to be unlikely that @entity12 would have joined @entity21 had he made it to @entity82 , because he would not have wanted to escape under the disguise of a footman ’s clothing			1
in the end , @entity21 was said to have been intercepted on the @entity136 in @entity137 as he tried to run his submarine out to sea			2
according to one account , the craft was then burned by authorities in @entity143 , @entity137 .			0

@entity21 claimed he was offered £ 40,000 in 1820 to rescue @entity12
emperor exiled by @entity42 to heavily - guarded @entity25 after @entity41 loss
