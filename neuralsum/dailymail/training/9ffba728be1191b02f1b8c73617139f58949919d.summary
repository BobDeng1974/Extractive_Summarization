by @entity0 if you 've ever compared store - bought eggs in the @entity3 with those in the @entity5 , you 'll have noticed a few very significant differences in taste , color and quality			1
this is due to the differing ways the eggs are farmed , stored and treated in the two countries - techniques so contrasting that eggs from the @entity5 would actually be considered illegal if they were sold in @entity3 , and vice versa			1
@entity5 eggs , for instance - which typically have more orange yolks than their @entity3 counterparts - are stored at room temperature , while those in the @entity3 are required by law to be stored at lower than 45 degrees @entity22 in order to prevent the risk of @entity25 spreading			1
eggs in different baskets : the differing ways eggs are farmed and stored in the @entity5 vs. the @entity3 mean that @entity5 eggs would be considered illegal if they were sold in @entity3 , and vice versa @entity5 grocery stores and households do not refrigerate their eggs because 90per cent of store - bought eggs in the @entity5 come from hens that have been vaccinated for salmonella			1
this practice of farmers vaccinating their hens came about after an outbreak in the @entity41 ; since then , salmonella in the @entity5 has been virtually wiped out			0
what 's more , @entity5 food regulators cite the fact that refrigerating eggs before a consumer buys them leads to a temperature change during transportation that can cause moisture to collect , making the eggs more vulnerable to harmful bacteria			2
not only are eggs stored in different ways in the two countries , but they 're also handled differently before they 're shipped to stores			2
in @entity3 , the @entity57 requires that farmers clean eggs in water that is at least 90 degrees @entity22 , in order get rid of potentially harmful fecal matter			2
the eggs are then sprayed with a chemical sanitizer before being dried completely , so that there is no moisture left on them which might increase the risk of bacteria forming			0
due to the cleaning process , eggs in @entity3 lose their natural thin outer layer , called the cuticle , which naturally protects them from contamination			2
but for the @entity5 , the painstaking process of cleaning eggs so thoroughly is seen as more trouble than it 's worth			0
' in @entity80 , it 's in the farmers ' best interests to produce to clean eggs , as no one is going to buy them if they 're dirty ' in fact , laws in the @entity5 and the @entity86 egg stipulate that @entity89 eggs - the ones sold on supermarket shelves - must not be washed or cleaned in any way			1
the reasoning is that a botched washing job , which can lead to excess moisture and therefore harmful bacteria development , is worse than not cleaning the eggs at all			0
what 's more , since @entity5 eggs are n't cleaned they have their cuticles intact , further protecting them from contamination			1
@entity103 , chief executive of the @entity104 , explained to @entity105 in 2012 : ' in @entity80 , the understanding is that this mandate actually encourages good husbandry on farms			0
' it 's in the farmers ' best interests then to produce to cleanest eggs possible , as no one is going to buy their eggs if they 're dirty			0
' while it 's unclear exactly why , anyone who has tasted both knows that these differences lead to @entity119 eggs usually tasting richer than @entity3 ones .			0

eggs in the @entity5 would be illegal in the @entity3 because they are not cleaned , and @entity3 eggs do n't comply with @entity5 laws because they are cleaned
@entity3 eggs are kept refrigerated for *safety* reasons , whereas @entity5 eggs are stored at room temperature
