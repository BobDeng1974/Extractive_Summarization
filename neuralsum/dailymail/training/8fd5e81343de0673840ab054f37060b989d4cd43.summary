' after 18 months of disruption the strategy that new ceo @entity8 has laid out seems to be taking hold			0
the business has stabilised and the @entity28 device is a critical milestone in efforts to rebuild the business			2

’ it also solves the problem of having to switch between landscape and portrait mode when taking a photo or filming a video			0
‘ we ’ve been living in a rectangular world for quite some time and know it ’s a great ergonomic design that drives content , media consumption and quick communications , ’ continued mr @entity264			0
‘ however , the rectangle has become a defacto approach to smartphone design , perhaps limiting innovations			0
‘ just as a passport is the universal symbol of mobility and was the inspiration for the size and form factor of this device , your @entity77 becomes your ticket to open new doors of opportunity			0
’ it is unclear how comfortable the phone will be to hold , when making a call for example , and @entity4 has not released any details about the price			0
the blog post did , however , position the device more towards businesses than consumers			0

while medical staff could view x-rays and medical documents in the office with a patient mr @entity264 concluded : ‘ the @entity28 will take you to new places on the best business trip you ’ve ever had			2
we want you to imagine the possibilities			0
