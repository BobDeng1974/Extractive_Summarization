by @entity0 published : 06:49 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 06:49 est , 17 september 2013 it may be in the same retail group as high - fashion @entity3 and @entity4 but for years @entity5 has been languishing in the style stakes - until it unveiled its slick new autumn collection			1
in an exclusive first look at the department store 's new advert , it is clear that @entity5 is adamant to give the most glamorous of its high street competitors a run for their money			1
the sexy new campaign , which sees a @entity18 lookalike model getting dressed for work , was created with the working mother in mind			2

the music choice of i am a @entity48 by @entity49 was key to the store 's female empowerment theme , and the model 's confident demeanous as she dresses , staring down the camera , backs it up			1

and all with a purse - friendly price tag			0
' @entity135 is a measured mix of clever pieces and wardrobe essentials that have created a very wearable and confident collection designed to suit every woman , ' say the store			1
easy to wear monochrome is key and comes in the form of stripes , geometrical prints , florals and bold mono - blocking			0
and for the more adventurous there are plenty of subtle colour injections with tones of emerald , claret , rust , teal and cobalt			0
fashion forward : monochrome and checks are key to the collection and come in the form of stripes , geometrical prints and bold mono - blocking ( l - jumper £ 28 , bag £ 28 , r - pyjama set £ 28 ) in a nod to @entity166 's @entity165 trend , classic shapes have been updated with tweed , textured knits , faux leather trimming , quilting and jacquard			1
and in another homage to high fashion the brand has used super chic model @entity175 , who bares a striking resemblance to it girl @entity18 , to showcase the collection			1
key looks for the new season are oversized knits or box tops worn with leather or print pencil skirts and the collection also serves up tweed coats , shift dresses and tunics			1
@entity5 have also taken note of the sports luxe trend , as championed by @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity18 , and introduced the style with silk - mix print bomber jackets and a quilted bomber teamed peg - leg trousers			0
comfort and style : there are plenty of cosy knits , black jeans and nude heels in the new collection , which starts at £ 10 ( jumper £ 25 , trousers £ 22 ) on trend : classic shapes have been updated with tweed , textured knits , faux leather trimming , quilting and jacquard ( l - tunic £ 35 , roll neck £ 10 , @entity218 - textured coat £ 65 , roll neck £ 10 , trousers £ 22 ) for outerwear , there are tweed and leather biker jackets , as well as khaki long jackets , which can be teamed with a roll neck and the boyfriend jean			1

@entity5 a / @entity111 is available in - store and online			2
familiar face : @entity5 's model , @entity175 ( left ) and her bushy eyebrows bear an uncanny resemblance to model - of - the - moment @entity18 ( right ) @entity5 began life in the 1970s and was acquired by sir @entity42 in 2002 and incorporated into the @entity41 in 2009			1
in early 2006 , @entity42 considered selling the store and contacted rivals including @entity249 and @entity250 with no success			1
in 2010 , @entity5 gave itself a brand overhaul by changing its logo , resurrecting the uppercase form of the abbreviation , launching an e-commerce website and a new store design			2
@entity5 has 179 stores nationwide and it has a rolling programme to modernise them ; about a quarter of the stores are now in the new formats			0

@entity268 offers over 30,000 products with on - line exclusives			0
@entity5 is expanding its international portfolio , currently at 90 stores			0
@entity273 set £ 28 it might have been given a glamorous new makeover but @entity5 has still kept its eye on the retail prize : the 30something professional woman with a bit of money to spend			2
like @entity281 , who has recently turned around its womenswear offering , the brand has listened to its customers and delivered wearable pieces that can be slotted in to an existing wardrobe ( complete with longer hemlines and sleeves ) rather than chasing the trends and trying to compete with ' younger ' brands like @entity3 or @entity292			2
interest comes in flashes of design detail rather than a too - short skirt or plunging neckline and while there is a nod to successful trends from the last few seasons ( pyjamas as outerwear , pictured right , were first seen in loud prints on the @entity306 catwalk ) the success of this collection lies in its simplicity : key pieces in easy - to - wear colours that will update a look without breaking the bank			2
favourite pieces include the @entity316 - style coat which i 'll be wearing with skinny leather trousers and the biker jacket worn with a 60s style polo neck .			2

high street store makes a *comeback* with fashionable new collection
' wearable and confident collection designed to suit every woman '
features vintage inspired shoes , lots of leather and tweed pencil skirts
