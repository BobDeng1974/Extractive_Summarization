that ’s what you feel when you meet a rhino in the wild			2
you just ca n’t come to terms with the fact that you and he are sharing the same air , the same continent , the same century			2
i ’ve had close - up experience with three of the world ’s five surviving species of rhino : the white rhino looks like the main battle tank of an extra-terrestrial army , while the black is more like a hot - rod armoured car			2
the greater one - horned rhino , meanwhile , sometimes called the @entity22 rhino , looks as if it ’s been riveted together from pieces of boiler - plate			2
surely they ca n’t be real			2
you feel as if you ’ve slipped back into the @entity27 era and were looking at some great horned dinosaur , for they could n’t possibly be part of the 21st century			2
it ’s as if the creatures of the past had suddenly invaded the present , as if the @entity35 of sir @entity36 had been found again			2
these rhinos are nothing to do with dinosaurs or with any vanished world			2
they ’re mammals , just like you and me , and they ’re as admirably adapted for the current century as we are			2
they ’re as modern as a child born yesterday : part of our present , not part of our past			2
yes , give them a fair crack of the whip and they ’d be as successful as any of the big creatures we have left on our planet , for in many countries the wild places they depend on are still in fine shape and perfectly capable of supporting any number of rhinos			2
so why are we running out of them ? why does the last surviving male of the northern sub-species of the white rhino now live under a 24 - hour guard ? why has he been stripped of his horn ? why is it that we seem to be on the brink of losing an entire race of rhinos ? threatened : @entity40 is the target of poachers looking to sell rhino horn which can make up to £ 47,000 a kilo this is the lonely rhino , known as @entity40 , guarded day and night by rangers who risk their own lives as they try to keep him from poachers			1
even without his horn , his keepers in the @entity94 reserve of @entity95 fear for his safety			1
it seems like madness — because it is madness			2
a rhino ’s horn is made from keratin , the same stuff as fingernails			1
you could collect your nail clippings and try to sell them , claiming that they were magic and capable of curing all kinds of things			2
you could try selling your keratin at £ 47,000 a kilo			1
you probably would n’t find many takers , but it ’s no more absurd than selling rhino horn for the same purposes and price			1
people will pay an absurd amount for an absurd product because of an absurd belief : that rhino horn is the most wonderful kind of medicine			1
today , the wildlife business — including the sale of rhino horn — represents the third - largest illegal trade in the world , after arms and drugs			1
it offers a considerable opportunity for criminals , because the authorities do n’t enforce the laws against it with anything like the same seriousness as they do with weapons and narcotics			0
and there is huge — and growing — demand			1
in 2007 , 13 rhinos were poached and killed in @entity142			0
the horns were removed and they were sold on the @entity145 medicine market			1
dangerous : the rangers are aware they are risking their lives to protect the enormous animal failure : but attempts at breeding have been unsuccessful - and @entity40 is now getting old last year in @entity142 1,215 rhinos were poached and killed			1
that ’s one every eight hours			0
we ’re running out of rhinos			0
the massacre is taking place across @entity142 and into @entity145			0
it ’s driven by money , and the more horn costs the more desirable the stuff becomes			1
@entity162 , status , vanity and belief in magic drive the trade in rhino horn			1
the fact that it ’s useless for anyone but a rhino has no bearing on demand			1
@entity176 horn has for centuries been part of traditional @entity180 medicine , and it ’s used to treat disorders of the blood			1
it ’s never been used as an aphrodisiac : that ’s a fantasy from bewildered @entity186			0
increasing prosperity in @entity180 has led to higher demand			1
but as the @entity142 poaching figures show , the market has jumped from steady but borderline sustainable to completely crazy , which has put rhinos on the fast - track to extinction			0
that ’s largely because of the entry of a new player : @entity197			0
the country ’s new wealth has kick - started a craze for rhino horn			1
they take a much more free and easy attitude to its powers there : it ’s regarded as a cure for cancer , and it ’s also used a pick - me - up after a big night			1
the effects of a powerful hangover can , people believe , be controlled — all it takes is one very rich man and one very dead rhino			0
can the trade possibly be stopped ? there are two ways of doing so : policing the poaching , smuggling and sale with more commitment , and reducing the demand in the places where people buy the stuff			1
in 2012 , the @entity142 and @entity197 governments signed a memorandum of understanding , agreeing to work with closer co-operation to stop the trade			1
you can see how well that ’s worked			0
in @entity197 a non-governmental organisation called @entity234 in @entity197 ( @entity235 ) is trying to make rhino horn uncool			1
it has a public service announcement with @entity197 ’s great singing diva , @entity239 , standing by a poached and dehorned corpse telling the @entity197 not to use rhino horn			1
and in another sequence , a comedian plays a rich man trying to impress the girls with his hideously expensive chunk of horn			1
the most beautiful girl says : ‘ it impresses no one , especially not me			0
’ @entity235 runs a hotline for information about rhino horn use and a database			1
it also has good contacts in government and works on policy			0
the organisation has plenty of young volunteers and a good deal of their work is making rhino horn unthinkable for the next generation			1
it gets some of its funding from the excellent @entity269 - based organisation @entity176 — of which i ’m a patron			1
extreme measures : rangers have even cut off the rhino 's horn - but they fear it wo n't be enough hungry : feeding time in @entity40 's enclosure - he spent most of his life in a @entity281 zoo there are also many good projects for rhino conservation in @entity142 and across the world			1
the @entity286 in @entity287 once held 4,000 black rhinos : they were poached out over 20 years and declared extinct in @entity287 in 1998			0
five years later , a project to release captive - bred black rhinos began : there are now 34 roaming free in the valley			0
most problems with conservation come from the rising human population , and with it , the destruction of habitat			0
in so many parts of the world , we are running out of room			0
but there ’s plenty of room left for rhinos in @entity142			0
conserving rhinos should be easy , yet they ’re going extinct not because of overcrowding but from human folly			0
rhinos are being killed because of belief in a discredited form of magic and the simple love of showing off			0
and yet you can go out into the wild areas of the world , especially in @entity142 , and still get close to these vast beasts			0
i once spent a day in @entity318 tracking a big male black rhino on foot and when at last we found him it seemed this might have been a mistake			2
there he was , 20 yards away , looking at me looking at him			0
one of those moments of eternity			0
but after a while he relaxed and got on with his life , snacking on bushes			0
big solid , fast and armed with that wonderful great bodger on his bonce , he ’s a modern creature fully equipped for the modern world , if only we ’d let him get on with it			0
but we ’re killing him off with money , greed , political inertia , incompetent policing , superstition and deadly vanity			0
so , a suggestion if you happen to be suffering from a hangover and wish to cure it			0
it ’s every bit as effective as a dead rhino .			0

@entity40 is guarded day and night by rangers to keep him from poachers
his horn has been removed to stop it being lost to illegal trade
@entity176 horn fetching as much as £ 47,000 per kilo as demand grows
