by @entity0 published : 21:32 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 23:05 est , 21 july 2013 the man who woke up in a @entity2 with no memory of his past life , is facing suspicion from doctors and those who knew him before his amnesia			1
@entity7 was discovered unconscious in a @entity9 room in february , but when he awoke he could not remember anything about himself , recognize even his own reflection , nor how to speak @entity12			1
when he woke up he believed he was @entity13 and only spoke in @entity14 , a persona that clashes with his social security card , passport and the veteran 's medical card he was carrying			1
faking it ? more friends have come forward saying they knew @entity7 before his amnesia , and they 're not buying the story who is @entity7 ? the man above woke up in a @entity2 @entity9 with no memory of his past life - only speaking @entity14 and responding to ' @entity13 ' doctors at @entity28 diagnosed @entity7 on march 13 as having transient global amnesia , but experts say there is no way to prove if he actually suffers from the disorder			1
skeptical : @entity34 knew @entity7 back in @entity35 , and helped the man get back to the @entity37 before his visa expired			1
he 's not sure if the amnesia is real but more is coming to light about @entity7 's life just prior to losing his memory			1
@entity34 met @entity7 in the first half of 2012 when they were both working as teachers in @entity45 , @entity35			2
@entity34 works at @entity46 , and @entity7 was then an @entity12 teacher at the @entity48 @entity12 school			1
they both loved tennis , and often met up to play on weekends			0
@entity34 says @entity7 was a very good tennis player , spoke flawless @entity12 and seemed to be healthy			1
he says everyone found @entity7 to be an ' affable , energetic guy ' and did n't seem to show any signs of past trauma - something doctors say sets off the amnesia			1
' there was no inkling of any deep personal issues			0
he never talked about money			0
he did n't talk much about his past life , ' @entity34 told @entity61 ' and then there was this one friday night where i get a phone call			1
' @entity7 was in trouble			2
all @entity67 could make out over the phone was his friend whispering for help			0
so he showed up at @entity7 's home with his wife and two other friends and found that the man they knew was living in a ' hovel ' - a single - room basement apartment that had no bathroom			1
@entity7 was inside and unconscious with a glass of vodka and half a vial of animal tranquilizers next to him			2
he was rushed to the hospital and treated , eventually being released into his friend 's care			0
during his time at @entity34 ' house , @entity7 talked about his ex-wife in @entity89 , and how he had been ' cut off ' from their son			2
baffling : @entity7 is pictured here with two women - one who is believed to be his wife and a little boy thought to be his son @entity7 admitted that he could n't go back to his job at the school and did n't know where to go next - his visa was set to expire			2
the @entity103 @entity12 school confirmed that @entity7 quit in january and that he had an ex-wife in @entity89			1
so @entity34 came up with an idea to send @entity7 to @entity2 , @entity106 to look for a job as a tennis instructor			1
he had contacts at a local @entity110 where @entity7 could try and get a job			0
@entity34 paid for @entity7 's one - way flight and gave his friend $ 400 to start a new life			2
lost : a picture of @entity7 in @entity35 failed to jog his memory @entity7 left @entity35 on february 24 , the last day of his visa , and that was the last time that @entity67 heard from his friend			1
@entity34 ' experiences with @entity7 just before he lost his memory shed light on what might have caused the man to subconsciously - or consciously - erase his old life			1
doctors say there 's no way to prove whether @entity7 actually suffers from amnesia , or if it 's something he 's making up			2
according to @entity130 , the director of the @entity131 at @entity132 , only a few of these cases happen a year and they are almost always met with doubt			0
relief : @entity7 uses exercise as the only way to concentrate his mind and not think about his memory loss he believes @entity7 suffers from a psychological disorder called ' dissociative amnesia ' which causes memory loss when a patient tries to block off a portion of their brain to protect themselves from painful memories			1
skills can be lost as well as languages and @entity130 says the memory loss can last months to years			1
as doctors ' are n't mind readers ' there 's no way to no for sure what 's going on with @entity7			0
' we just do n't know how conscious this is , ' @entity130 said			0
' and unless the person suddenly comes to you and confesses - and says , " i 've just been playing you like a song			0
i 've been faking it all along " - unless they say that , you never really know how conscious it is			0
' speaking @entity14 : members of the @entity14 community in @entity2 believe that @entity7 lived in @entity165 in the mid- 80s @entity166 for one , does n't believe that @entity7 lost his memory			1
' i just think here is a guy that has no place to go , is desperate and is broke			0
if he does this , at least he has a bed and three meals a day , ' @entity34 said			0
' he 's reached the end of his line			0
but that 's just a personal perception			0
' the @entity14 - @entity37 community in @entity2 also finds aspects of ' @entity13 ' questionable			1
they 've been helping him adjust to his new reality at the @entity186 's @entity185			0
after five months of trying to dupe him into speaking @entity12 , he has n't slipped once said his social worker @entity188			0
one of @entity7 's friends at the @entity186 , @entity190 , does believe that @entity7 lived in @entity165 during the mid- 1980s , but he does n't speak with a regional accent which is strange			2
@entity190 says this could be because he learned the language later in life , or has n't used it much during his adult life			0
speaking through a translator with @entity61 , @entity7 assures that his amnesia is real , and a living hell			2
' walk in my shoes for one day , ' he said			0
' you 'll experience the nightmare of a lifetime			0

@entity7 woke up in a @entity2 @entity9 in february with no memory of his past life
the former @entity12 teacher now only communicates in @entity14 and believes he is ' @entity13 '
friends who sent him back to the @entity37 *shortly* before his memory loss find the amnesia *dubious*
experts say there is no way to tell is @entity7 is telling the truth , or pretending to suffer from memory loss
