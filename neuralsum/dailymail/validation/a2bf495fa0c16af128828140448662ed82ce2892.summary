millions of patients will have access to a full range of hospital services seven days a week by 2020 , @entity0 will pledge today millions of patients will have access to a full range of hospital services seven days a week by 2020 , @entity0 will pledge today			1
consultant - level care and scans will be offered every day to end the scandal of poor out - of - hours treatment			1
the prime minister will admit that @entity12 are ‘ more likely to die ’ if they turn up at weekends and outline plans to use £ 2billion to fund the move in @entity15			1
his announcement ensures that the two main parties will now go head - to - head on the @entity18 at the start of the general election campaign			1
but @entity21 said the @entity22 had promised a seven - day @entity18 before the last election and failed to deliver it			1
and there were doubts about whether the commitment could be met without injecting billions of pounds or higher bills for agency staff and locums			0
the prime minister will insist that maintaining funding for public services is only possible with a strong economy , urging voters to stick to the @entity35 ’ ‘ long - term economic plan ’			1
his reforms would be rolled out step by step , starting with emergency and urgent care and support services such as scans			1
some hospitals are already providing services at the weekend			1
@entity46 , rated outstanding by watchdogs , offers consultant - led emergency care from 8am to midnight , seven days a week			1
@entity50 offers services such as ct scans on weekday evenings and from 9am to 5pm at the weekend			1
at @entity54 , an increase in consultants on weekend duty saw a 34 per cent rise in patients being discharged the same or the following day			1
in his speech at the conservative spring conference in @entity63 today , the prime minister will say : ‘ for years it ’s been too hard to access the @entity18 out of hours			1
‘ but illness does n’t respect working hours			0
heart attacks , major accidents , babies – these things do n’t just come from 9 to 5			0
‘ and the truth is that you are actually more likely to die if you turn up at the hospital at the weekend			1
some of the resources are not up and running			0
the key decision - makers are n’t always there			2
‘ with a future @entity22 government , we would have a truly seven - day @entity18			1
studies also show that death rates among patients admitted on a sunday are 16 per cent higher than for those admitted on a wednesday			2
professor sir @entity90 , the @entity18 medical director , said it was ‘ inefficient ’ for diagnostic machines and pathology laboratories to lie dormant at weekends while access is ‘ dogged by waiting lists ’			2
professor sir @entity96 , former president of the @entity97 , said the planned reform could ‘ transform the quality of care ’ at the weekend			2
but @entity21 health spokesman @entity101 said mr @entity0 was making the same promise he did five years ago			1
‘ it is typical of the brass neck of a man who thinks he can take the public for mugs , ’ he added			0
and dr @entity108 , of the @entity109 , called it ‘ shameless political game - playing ’ ahead of the election			2
he added : ‘ it will , for example , take much longer than five years to train the extra doctors needed , and without a considerable increase in staff and resources , weekday services might face being scaled back , affecting patient care			1
’ @entity121 yesterday pledged to cap the profits of private firms providing @entity18 care			2
kicking off his election campaign at the site of the @entity127 , he said @entity21 would halt what he called a ‘ tide of privatisation ’ in the @entity18			0

@entity121 yesterday pledged to cap the profits of private firms providing @entity18 care , bringing in a five per cent profit cap mr @entity121 said yesterday that another five years of @entity22 government would mean ‘ the disintegration of our public services ’			1
‘ we ’ll scrap @entity0 ’s market framework for the @entity18 and stop the tide of privatisation , ’ he said			1
‘ the @entity18 will be the preferred provider			0
no company working with the @entity18 will be able to profit by cherry - picking : rejecting patients with the more complex and expensive needs			1
‘ we will cap the profits that private health companies can make from our nhs			0
‘ the standard rule will be a five per cent cap			0
the money we pay for our health care should be invested for patient care , not for excess profits for private firms			2
’ @entity21 said the profit cap would apply to all @entity18 contracts worth £ 500,000 or more			2
any company that made more than five per cent from the contract would be forced to reimburse the @entity18 for any returns above that level			2
local @entity18 commissioners would have the power to allow higher profits in exceptional circumstances and the cap would not apply to gps , pharmacies or dentists			0

he warned that mr @entity121 ’s profit cap ran the risk of being a pre-election promise ‘ which does n’t stand up when confronted with the reality of government ’			0
‘ it ’s far from clear how you would implement it , ’ he said			0
‘ a lot of the private sector is currently providing services to the @entity18 at standard @entity18 tariffs			0
is that a profit ? ‘ if you want to scare people , you can scare people			0
but all the work that was done in the @entity206 government on choice and competition showed that people did n’t have concerns on whether work was done by the private or public sector			0
what they were concerned with was whether they would have to pay and was their care safe			0
’ health secretary @entity214 said : ‘ we all know @entity21 want to “ weaponise ” the @entity18 but this is another policy from @entity121 that looks ill - thought through			0
