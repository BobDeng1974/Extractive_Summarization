this was a walkover , a day @entity0 undermined the race for @entity5 promotion in a bid to reach @entity7			0
@entity9 's decision to make nine changes is surely down to the ridiculous scheduling of monday ’s @entity13 quarter - final replay against @entity14 , but some of his @entity17 counterparts might not be impressed			1
@entity18 were picked off by @entity19			2
that ’s not the fault of @entity9 , the blame lying squarely with wretched broadcasting rules which deem domestic cup games can not be played on the same night as @entity26 fixtures			0
@entity27 ( centre ) got @entity19 off to a dream start against @entity0 by scoring inside a minute @entity19 striker @entity30 celebrates @entity27 's strike as the @entity32 set the tone for the match early on @entity19 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity35 6.5 ; @entity36 7.5 , @entity37 7 , @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 7 ; @entity40 8 , @entity41 7 ( @entity42 58 , 6 ) , @entity43 6 ; @entity27 7 ( @entity44 7 , 8.5 ) ; @entity45 8 ( @entity46 83 ) , @entity30 7.5 subs not used : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 goals : @entity27 1 , @entity45 39 , @entity30 48 , @entity44 85 @entity0 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity53 5 ; @entity54 6 , @entity55 6 ( @entity56 86 ) , @entity57 5 ; @entity58 5.5 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 6 , @entity61 6 ( @entity62 59 , 7 ) , @entity63 6 ; @entity64 6 ( @entity65 59 , 6 ) , @entity66 6 subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 goal : @entity62 70 referee : @entity48 ( @entity74 ) attendance : 16,600 but other managers , particularly @entity77 and @entity78 - whose sides both dropped points - may talk of a duty of care to the league , even if @entity0 can do nothing but finish mid-table themselves			1
the average squad number of the visitors here was 26 , a statistic to tell all			0
@entity9 is set to name a completely fresh xi tomorrow night and was understandably prickly when asked about the changes			0
‘ what ramifications ? i ca n’t think for the life of me why there would be any ramifications - i ’m not concerned whatsoever , ’ he said			0
i ’m allowed to pick from my squad , so i ’ll pick from my squad			0
’ fifty - two seconds is all it took the hosts , @entity30 popping a neat ball into @entity27 , who stroked beyond @entity103 with the outside of his boot			1
@entity36 ’s stunning 30 - yard half - volley cannoned off the bar six minutes later			1
@entity103 then made an acrobatic save from early substitute @entity44 ’s overhead kick , and this was put beyond doubt when @entity45 slipped his man and lifted into the net with ease before half - time			1
prior to the match @entity19 players show their support for fan @entity118 who was attacked last weekend @entity45 doubled @entity19 's lead shortly before half - time with a right - footed effort @entity122 ( right ) watches on as his shot goes past @entity0 goalkeeper @entity124 on 39 minutes just after the break @entity44 darted round his man at the byline , allowing @entity30 to get in on the act , tapping home from inside the six - yard box			1
‘ i ’ve got to be happy today , ’ @entity32 boss @entity131 said			2
‘ @entity0 have an important game in front of them - i expected changes			0
’ to their credit , @entity9 ’s side improved and he will leave @entity138 with some sense of satisfaction after @entity62 - making just his second appearance since september 2013 because of persistent knee problems - bent a classy consolation on his comeback			1
but @entity44 was to slam in a fourth late on , banging the club mascot ’s drum in celebration			2
back in the top two , more and more are banging the @entity5 drum around these parts .			0

@entity19 took the lead within seconds through @entity27 's strike
@entity45 doubled the hosts ' *advantage* on 39 minutes
@entity32 *captain* @entity30 added a third shortly before half - time
@entity62 *pulled* one back for the visitors on 70 minutes
@entity44 completed the *scoreline* as @entity19 won easily
