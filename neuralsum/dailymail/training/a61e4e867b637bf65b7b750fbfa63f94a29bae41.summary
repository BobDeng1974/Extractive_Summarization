@entity4 has now discussed all about the experience and relived how he was commanding the ship when radar screens showed that there were four @entity25 planes heading towards @entity2			1
ordeal : @entity4 was the captain of the destroyer , which sank , killing 19 crewmembers , when @entity25 jets shot it down on 25 may , 1982 , seen here with a 10 - year - old @entity5 and family he knew when ' they were taking off from the runways in @entity25 ' but he soon lost track of them and had to face a tricky decision , which he still dwells on to this day			1
@entity4 told the @entity38 : ' things happen quickly			0
on my left was the air warfare officer saying " get the missile out " and a chap on my right saying " i think they are to the north - west "			0
' he eventually decided to not send out any @entity48 and opted to deploy missiles instead because he ' was n't sure the @entity48 would get there on time '			0
the ship was eventually hit by a bomb and as it sank @entity4 was the last to leave the destroyer , which had been deployed by then prime minister @entity56 to help liberate the @entity57 following @entity25 's invasion			2
he recounts : ' it was black , with people on fire ... i was momentarily stunned and came round seconds later ... ' by the time i got up it was all happening			0
i walked down the ship 's side - it was almost horizontal at that point '			0
@entity4 swam to the nearest raft and managed to survive			0
but while it was a terrifying ordeal which still has its place in history , his daughter @entity5 , who was just 10 when her father was sent to command the @entity2 during the conflict , does n't remember it having much of an impact on her			2
the funnywoman and tv star insists ' the impact ' was ' minimal ' and she even just asked her mum for a flapjack when she was told about his lucky escape			0
