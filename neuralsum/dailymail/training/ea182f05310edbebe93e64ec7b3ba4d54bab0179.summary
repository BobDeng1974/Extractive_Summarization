he was freed from prison on compassionate grounds because he supposedly only had months to live			1
now - two and a half years on - the @entity4 bomber will protest his innocence in ' deathbed memoirs ' to be published next week			1
to avoid a public backlash , profits from sales will be handed to charities – with the convicted terrorist himself receiving none of the cash			1
deathbed : @entity15 has terminal cancer however , it has emerged that one of the first beneficiaries is likely to be a group which has publicly backed @entity15 ’s fight to clear his name			0
the move will raise fears that the @entity25 will indirectly profit from a boost to the campaign to prove his innocence			1
the book could also heap fresh embarrassment on the @entity31 and @entity32 , whose ministers repeatedly claimed the decision to free @entity15 , incensing @entity4 victims ' families , was taken solely by the @entity31 on ' compassionate grounds '			1
but documents have since come to light showing that @entity32 secretly helped free @entity15 to appease @entity41 , who was threatening to scupper oil contracts and unleash ' holy war ' on @entity44			1
@entity15 was controversially released from a life sentence in august 2009 because of his terminal illness			2
he was believed to have only months to live			1
not for profit : proceeds from @entity15 's book will go to charity the former @entity25 intelligence officer is the only person convicted of the december 21 , 1988 atrocity			2
the bombing of @entity4 over @entity54 killed 270 people			1
upon his release , he returned to @entity25 , where he was hailed as a hero			0
he was last seen in december , apparently with just days to live , when he gave an interview from his death bed			2
speaking from his family home in @entity62 , he protested his innocence and asked to be left alone to die from the ravages caused by prostate cancer			2
he said he had little knowledge of the circumstances surrounding @entity41 's overthrow and claimed @entity25 opposition fighters had invaded his home and mistreated him			0
relatives of those killed in the december 1988 atrocity claimed any profits should go instead to those affected by the attack			0
@entity77 , president of @entity78 – which represents the families of the @entity81 who died – said : ‘ why not give this money to the people of @entity4 , or give it to the people who helped the victims ’ relatives ? ‘ at the very least it would have been less contentious to give it to charities which have n’t actively supported him			2
’ however , he added : ‘ victims ’ relatives in the @entity81 would n’t accept five cents from him and they know the whole book is really nothing more than a fraud			0
’ tragedy : rescue workers at the crash site of @entity4 in @entity4 , in 1988 @entity15 , who will turn 60 on april 1 , has worked on the book with @entity102 author @entity101 since his release from @entity104 in @entity105			1
@entity108 - based publisher @entity106 is to unveil @entity15 – you are my jury : the @entity112 on tuesday next week and is planning to donate all the profits to charity			1

@entity122 's welcome : @entity25 greet freed @entity4 bomber @entity15 ( centre ) on his arrival in @entity62 in august 2009 its project co-ordinator , @entity125 , has said @entity15 should never have been convicted , calling him a ‘ political pawn			1
’ a @entity120 spokesman said ‘ in principle ’ the @entity130 - based charity would be happy to accept the cash and the decision was likely to be ratified at a meeting tomorrow			2
but last night @entity54 @entity136 justice spokesman @entity135 said : ‘ the publication of a book written by @entity15 , the @entity44 ’s worst mass murderer , will only cause further heartache for the families of his victims			1
‘ it ’s a bitter reminder that a man given a short time to live and let out of jail by the @entity145 is now authoring a book two - and - a - half years later , which further demonstrates the folly of this decision			1
’ the 496 - page paperback , priced at £ 14.99 , promises to present ‘ conclusive new evidence ’ to prove @entity15 was ‘ an innocent victim of dirty politics , a flawed investigation and judicial folly ’			2
in it , @entity15 will claim to reveal ‘ how i came to be blamed for @entity44 ’s worst mass murder , my nightmare decade in prison and the truth about my controversial release ’			0
a @entity161 @entity54 documentary to accompany the publication of the book will also be aired next monday			1
home : @entity15 ( centre left ) holds the hand of then @entity25 leader @entity41 's son @entity166 ( in white ) as a crowd in @entity62 cheer his return last night , a @entity106 spokesman insisted ‘ no money will ever go to @entity15 ’			0

a great deal more information has come to light since the trial			0
’ author mr @entity101 , who has invested much of his own money in the project , said : ‘ on the advice of his lawyers , @entity191 opted not to give evidence at trial – a decision he regretted			0
the book presents the account that he would have given at trial and leaves it to the readers to judge			0
’ a @entity31 spokesman said : ‘ we do not doubt the safety of the conviction of @entity15 , who was found guilty of an act of state - sponsored terrorism and did not act alone			0

profits from book sales will go to charity that campaigns for his innocence
terminally - ill @entity4 bomber still alive after being given just three months to live two - and - a - half years *ago*
released from prison on ' compassionate grounds '
could prove embarrassing for @entity32 and the @entity54 government
