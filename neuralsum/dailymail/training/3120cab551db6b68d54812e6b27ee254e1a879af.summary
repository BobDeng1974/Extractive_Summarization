the @entity0 is locked in a stand - off with mps over its coverage of @entity4			1
furious mps accused director - general @entity6 of putting the @entity0 ' above accountability ' by refusing to answer questions from the @entity9 about the corporation 's alleged bias on the issue			1
@entity6 was accused of ' hiding ' behind historic rules that mean members of the @entity15 can not be summoned to answer questions in the @entity9			1
@entity0 director - general @entity6 of putting the @entity0 ' above accountability ' by refusing to answer questions from the @entity9 @entity4 scrutiny committee @entity20 today urged @entity6 to back down , saying that as a ' general rule ' @entity0 executives should be willing to answer questions from @entity5			1
' the @entity0 needs to be , and is , publicly accountable , ' he said			1
@entity24 @entity5 said the stand - off raised questions about whether peers should be allowed to run major public bodies			2
conservative mp @entity29 said : ' it creates the impression that the @entity0 holds itself above accountability			2
' fellow @entity24 @entity33 said : ' it makes it difficult for peers to be put in charge of public bodies if they are going to hide behind their privileges to avoid questioning			0
' @entity0 chairman @entity41 insisted @entity6 could not answer questions about the corporation 's coverage of @entity4 because it might threaten the @entity0 's independence in the run - up to the election			1
she insisted he was not using his privileges as a member of the @entity15 to stay away			0
mrs @entity41 said that a number of @entity53 executives had already appeared before the committee to answer questions on the issue			1
and she said she was also willing to discuss the broad issues around the @entity0 's coverage			2
@entity20 , arriving back at @entity59 after prime minister 's questions this afternoon , has urged the @entity0 chief to stay ' accountable ' but she claimed @entity6 's position as the @entity0 's ' editor - in - chief ' meant it would be wrong for him to face questions on politically sensitive issues because it could cast doubt on the corporation 's ' independence '			1
she told mps : ' the director - general did not refuse to come because he is a peer			0
the question of independence is a very delicate one			0
' there is a question of what is an appropriate level of scrutiny by parliament if the @entity0 is to remain independent			2
' under parliamentary rules , commons committees can require almost anyone to appear before them to answer questions			1
those who refuse risk being found in contempt of parliament , which is punishable by a jail term			0
@entity93 , who was dragged to the commons this week to answer questions about @entity96 , is one of a number of reluctant witnesses summoned in recent years			1
but peers enjoy an exemption from the rules and can not be summoned			2
a decade ago , a major review by the former cabinet secretary lord @entity103 , reported a ' widespread perception ' of ' certain forms of cultural and unintentional bias ' in favour of the @entity108			0
mrs @entity41 said a number of changes had been made since , including the appointment of a dedicated @entity4 editor			0
@entity113 , chairman of the @entity115 's editorial standards committee , yesterday confirmed it receives numerous complaints about its @entity4 coverage - including eight separate cases over the last three years			0
but he said it had not upheld any complaints on the issue since at least 2007			0
@entity6 's refusal to attend was raised with the prime minister yesterday			0
@entity24 mp sir @entity125 called for a review of the exemption for peers , saying : ' @entity6 , is refusing to give evidence to another @entity130 on the grounds that he is a member of parliament			2
he is also a paid public servant			0
is it not time that we reviewed the matter of parliamentary privilege ? ' mr @entity20 replied : ' the general rule should be that people involved in the senior management of the @entity0 who are summoned to appear in front of a @entity130 should come , because the @entity0 needs to be , and is , publicly accountable			1
i think @entity6 does a very good job at the @entity0 , and i am sure he would give a good account of himself , but i will have a careful look at it			1
' a @entity0 spokesperson said : ' the director general never has and never would use his membership of the @entity15 as a reason not to appear before a select committee			0
' the @entity0 is editorially independent and accountable to the @entity115 for our broad coverage of issues			2
' the chairman of the @entity115 will be appearing in front of the committee and we believe that this strikes the right balance between the @entity0 's independence and accountability to @entity160			0
