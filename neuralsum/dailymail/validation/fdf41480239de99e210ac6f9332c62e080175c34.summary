as a @entity2 mp in the 1980s @entity0 had a special talent			1
some mps courted attention through their colourful personal lives			2
others with their extremist political views			1
@entity0 found controversy in both			1
in an age before politicians were out of the closet – and when the age of consent for homosexual sex was 21 – it was an open secret in @entity14 that the impeccably turned - out @entity0 was gay			1
but his political downfall in 1987 – accompanied by newspaper headlines of teenage rent boys and spanking parties – was one of the most dramatic scandals in recent memory as he pleaded guilty to charges of gross indecency after repeated public denials that he had done anything wrong			1
@entity0 , former @entity2 mp , had his home searched by police as part of a probe into historic allegations of child sex abuse downfall : @entity0 on his way to magistrates ' court in 1987 to answer charges of gross indecency as for his politics , his views on immigration were considered so far beyond the pale that while serving as an mp he was beaten unconscious at a demonstration in @entity41 , had red paint thrown over him when addressing @entity43 , and burning papers were thrust through the letter box of his tiny terrace home in @entity47			1
he shared the house with his feisty mother @entity49			2
‘ i ’m the only woman in his life , ’ she once told reporters			0
it was n’t quite true			0
@entity0 , who became mp for @entity57 in the 1979 general election which swept mrs @entity56 to power , was a lifelong fan of the @entity60			1
@entity0 was forced to deny any knowledge of the abuse and deaths of three young boys to the media but within weeks of being elected he was irritating her and the @entity2 high command with his strident views on migration , backing a motion calling for a ban on immigration from @entity74 countries			1
urging the abolition of the @entity76 , he demanded the forcible repatriation of 50,000 ‘ coloured ’ immigrants a year , proposing a £ 7,000 payment to encourage them to go			2
he was also one of seven @entity2 mps who rebelled against legislation allowing parents to exempt their children from corporal punishment in schools			0
and he attempted to halt the growing tide of political correctness by launching a campaign to save the golliwog			2
born and brought up in @entity41 where he went to the local grammar , @entity92 for boys , he eschewed his @entity95 name , @entity96 , and always went by his second name , @entity98			0
he studied history at the @entity100 , where he had his first of many brushes with notoriety			0
as chairman of the university @entity2 association he invited @entity107 , who had been sacked from the conservative shadow cabinet after his ‘ rivers of blood ’ speech on immigration , to make a keynote address			2
there was a predictable uproar and the meeting became a riot			0
it was a sign of things to come – whenever @entity0 addressed a university as an mp he was the subject of angry and often violent protests			1
after university he worked for the @entity2 research department in @entity125 near the houses of @entity127			0
by the time he became mp for @entity57 in 1979 , he was already a darling of the @entity129 as a leading figure in the notorious @entity131 , a lobby group for the @entity2 but considered so extreme that in 2001 the party severed all links with it			1
the group advocated voluntary or assisted repatriation for non-white immigrants , capital punishment , and denounced @entity138 as a criminal and terrorist who deserved to be locked up			0
tall and gangly – he was once described in the @entity141 as a loping greyhound – the softly spoken @entity0 revelled in the notoriety of being one of the most outspoken voices on the @entity2 backbenches			1
on wednesday , detectives arrived at @entity148 ( pictured ) near @entity149 – the seat of the @entity151 – where @entity0 has lived since 2003 , and searched the 16,000 - acre estate when @entity154 - controlled @entity57 council passed a motion of no confidence in him as the local mp because of his views on race , he was delighted			1
after the re-drawing of political boundaries jeopardised his majority in @entity57 , he was selected for the safe neighbouring seat of @entity47 , which he won convincingly at the 1983 election			1
@entity0 was loved by his local party because of his uncompromising views			1
he called for the suspension of grants to students if they lacked self - discipline and for administrative and other non-academic parts of universities to be sold to the private sector			0
his devoted @entity2 followers in @entity57 and @entity47 were oblivious to his homosexuality			0
while he was out with political friends he never discussed his private life			0
‘ it ’s not relevant to my work as an mp , ’ was his stock reply			0
fiercely ambitious , @entity0 was consistently overlooked for ministerial preferment by @entity56 because of views on immigration which even some @entity185 viewed as racist			1
the @entity189 , in charge of party discipline , also feared his sexuality would be an issue that would return to haunt them			0
the first story to emerge in public about it was in 1981 , when @entity197 , a flamboyant art dealer who was his boyfriend , had left the mp ’s @entity198 flat after a row and @entity0 refused to let him back in			1
the fracas led to a court appearance in which @entity197 claimed he was in a relationship – albeit it a very tempestuous one – with the mp			0
@entity0 repudiated the claim and got away with it			1
lurid allegations surfaced in a sunday newspaper in september 1986 claiming he had organised gay spanking sessions with canes and teenage rent boys in his flat – allegations he dismissed as monstrous			0
@entity0 resigned after he was charged over spanking parties with teenage rent boys at his flat and lost his house and flat , before signing on the dole he was embarrassed again soon afterwards when @entity197 , who remained his long - term lover , was found in his underpants by the police outside the mp ’s apartment			1
he admitted that he ‘ loved ’ @entity219 but insisted the relationship was not sexual			0
days later a story emerged of how a naked @entity222 boy had been found under @entity0 ’s hotel bed on a @entity225 holiday			2
when police eventually charged him over the teenage rent boys in his flat , @entity0 bowed to the inevitable and announced he was standing down as an mp , admitting to a charge of gross indecency and accepting a fine of £ 1,450			1
he had to sell his house in the constituency and the flat in @entity198 and was on the dole for a year			1
but with the help of a £ 2,000 government grant and friends – including @entity237 , @entity238 and other mps who between them raised £ 75,000 on his behalf – he turned from politics to hosiery , opening a shop , @entity0 ’s , in @entity246 selling shirts , gaudy waistcoats , silk ties , and natty cuff links			2
infamously , he hung a sign in the shop window saying : ‘ @entity253 lifters will not be prosecuted			0
’ initially business seemed to be flourishing – @entity255 , when he became prime minister , ditched his @entity258 shirts in favour of @entity0 ’s more elegant wares – and he opened a second shop in @entity262			2
but he could never escape his past			0
one day in 1992 , two men walked into the @entity246 shop			0
one of them demanded : ‘ have you any boys for tying up before you spank them , ’ and then the men started punching him			0
after a £ 2,000 government grant he set up a chain of shops under his name selling shirts , ties and cuff links @entity0 ’s friend @entity276 , then a government minister and in the shop at the time , came to @entity0 ’s aide and received a broken nose for his pains			2
from then on , the shops went into decline			0
they were forced into liquidation in 2000 and @entity0 disappeared beneath the radar only to re-emerge in 2004 at the @entity151 of @entity289 ’s ancestral seat , the gothic @entity148 , where he is the events manager			2
the 68 - year - old @entity0 now lives in a large country house on the 18,000 - acre estate near @entity149 – the birthplace of his heroine @entity56			1
a house now being searched by the police			0
