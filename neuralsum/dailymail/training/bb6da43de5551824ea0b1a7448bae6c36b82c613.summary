the @entity0 came in for a barrage of complaints for everything from its lack of innovation to its new power connector socket and its mapping application			1
@entity1 added a @entity65 to 30 - pin power socket to the @entity0 , which meant previous @entity1 users could n't use their older chargers to charge the new device			2
@entity1 then charged extra for an adapter			0
previous iphones used a @entity73 mapping application but this was replaced with @entity13 in the @entity0			2

other @entity0 users reported that white handsets leaked light behind the screen			2
@entity118 , senior analyst at we are @entity22 , said : ' brands were often on the receiving end of criticism for their handsets offering nothing new to the previous model			0
' the most successful launches were those that captured the consumer 's imagination by talking about the handset 's new and innovative features			2
' and while leaks can be an important tool in building success , give away too much and the handset loses its ' wow ' factor upon launch			2
' he said @entity17 had the most ' wow factor ' with 56 per cent of discussions being about new or different features with a particular emphasis on its eye tracking			2
in contrast , only 29 per cent of conversations about the @entity0 launch were focused on different features as dissent grows about the lack of innovation at @entity1			1

men dominate smartphone launch day conversations with 83 per cent of all mentions coming from men and just 17 per cent generated by women			0
on a non-launch day , however , anywhere between 28 per cent and 41 per cent of conversations about mobile phones come from women			0
