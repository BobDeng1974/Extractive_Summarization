@entity0 are set to name an unchanged xi in thursday 's fourth @entity2 against @entity3 in @entity4 after squaring the series in @entity6 last week			1
barring a late change of plan , that will mean no instant return for @entity12 fast bowler @entity11 , who was added to the 13 - man squad in place on the injured @entity15 and has been talked up by @entity0 in the build - up to this game			1
@entity18 understands that the @entity0 selectors are not willing to tinker with a winning team , which means a reprieve for @entity22 , the @entity23 seamer who struggled with his rhythm at the @entity25 and whose five test wickets have so far cost 70 apiece			1
he has picked up 44 @entity58 wickets in the @entity59 this season at 29 apiece , and @entity0 selector @entity61 suggested on sunday that the ‘ time was right ’ for him to rejoin the international fray			2
asked about the possibility about of making a change for this side , @entity27 said : ‘ we had n’t won for 10 games			0
you always try to pick your best team , but you balance that with continuity			0
@entity71 in that team do n’t want to be keep looking over shoulder – i ’m in and i ’m out			0
you make calls like that , but successful sides built on a bit more stability than that			0
’ @entity35 is expected to offer more bounce than any surface @entity0 have encountered this summer , leading to speculation that the 6ft 7in @entity11 was set to make his return			1
the onus could now fall on @entity0 ’s next - tallest bowler , @entity50 , to make an impact			2
@entity3 , meanwhile , could make three changes to the team who put up so little resistance at @entity6			1
off - spinner @entity92 could play his first game of the series , in place of batsman @entity97 , while fast bowler @entity98 is in the mix , possibly at the expense of the luckless @entity101			0
@entity3 could go for experience at the top of the order , too , where @entity105 might replace @entity106			0
missing out : @entity11 is not part of the xi despite suggestions he 'd be picked on the fast , bouncy surface up off the floor : @entity0 and @entity27 are ready to kick on after their first @entity2 win for a year			2

@entity0 to pick same side for fourth test at @entity35
@entity11 was *tipped* to return in @entity4
@entity22 stays despite a disappointing *display* in @entity6
@entity92 could come in for @entity3
