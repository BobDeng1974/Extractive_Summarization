by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 11:40 est , 4 september 2012 we have all gone to lengths to avoid people we do n't like - but it appears a group of tigers in @entity7 have adopted a ' night shift ' to better co-exist with their human neighbors			1
the lives of the tigers and people of @entity15 fly in the face of long - held convictions in conservation circles - both sharing exactly the same space , including the same roads and trails			1
@entity23 , director of the @entity25 and @entity26 , and phd student @entity27 spent two seasons setting motion - detecting cameras to observe tigers , their prey and people who walk the roads and trails of @entity36 , both in and around the park			1
@entity36 , nestled in a valley of the @entity39 , is home to about 121 tigers , while people live on the park 's borders , but rely on the forests for ecosystem services such as wood and grasses			1
the @entity15 is home to elephants , rhinos , leopards and tigers - and people who live among the wildlife ' captured by the lens ' : phd student @entity27 set up multiple cameras to monitor tigers around the @entity7 site the local @entity60 population also use the same routes through the forest , but both species seem to function fine on different ' shifts ' the roads also are used by military patrols to thwart would - be poachers , and all who venture on the dirt roads and narrow footpaths are ' snared ' on @entity27 's digital memory cards			1
@entity27 's analysis of the thousands of images show that people and tigers are walking the same paths , albeit at different times			2
tigers typically move around at all times of the day and night , monitoring their territory , mating and hunting			1
but in the study area , @entity27 and his colleagues discovered that the tigers had become creatures of the night			1
the camera 's infrared lights document a pronounced shift toward nocturnal activity			0
people in @entity7 generally avoid the forests at night			1
essentially , quitting time for people signals starting time for @entity36 's tigers			2
student @entity27 on the trail : his cameras allowed remote monitoring of users of the path so far , it appears tiger population numbers are holding steady despite an increase in human population size			0
' it 's a very fundamental conflict over resources , ' @entity27 said			0
' @entity79 need resources , people need the same resources			0
if we operate under the traditional wisdom that tigers only can survive with space dedicated only for them , there would always be conflict			2
' if your priority is people , tigers lose out			2
if your priority is tigers , people lose out			2
' but he added : ' conditions for tigers in @entity36 are good			0
' prey numbers are high , forests outside the park are regenerating , and poaching of tigers and their prey is relatively low			0
' however , people of different stripes , including tourists and local residents , frequent the forests of @entity36			0
' @entity79 need to use the same space as people if they are to have a viable long - term future			0
what we 're learning in @entity36 is that tigers seem to be adapting to make it work			0
' there appears to be a middle ground where you might actually be able to protect the species at high densities and give people access to forest goods they need to live			1
' if that 's the case , then this can happen in other places , and the future of tigers is much brighter than it would be otherwise			0

tigers are active night and day - but appear to have changed *patterns* on @entity15 , @entity7
*researchers* say this ' middle - ground ' works both for humans and tigers in the area
