by @entity0 two men have been jailed for a large - scale human trafficking ring which saw @entity3 lured to work in the @entity4 as modern - day slaves - being paid a measly £ 10 for a 100 - hour week			1
up to 50 men were kept in one house in @entity8 , @entity9 , and were subjected to regular beatings - with one house rule that no - one could say ‘ no ’ to their keepers			0
@entity13 , 43 , and @entity14 , 25 , were sentenced on tuesday at @entity15 to five years and three years respectively after pleading guilty to people trafficking offences			1
the court heard @entity13 preyed on vulnerable @entity3 with promises of well - paid factory and labouring work and accommodation			1
workers lived in accommodation in @entity36 , @entity8 , @entity37 and @entity38 , where beatings were regularly dished out by @entity13			1
they were then sent to work throughout @entity42 , @entity38 and @entity43			2
many were too scared to escape and one woman who had lost her job feared for her life after she overheard @entity13 saying she would be killed			1
sentencing , judge @entity48 said the victims were forced to live in ' severely cramped , multi-occupancy rooms in @entity42 and left in fear of violence if they protested '			1
@entity53 launched @entity54 back in 2011 after an alleged victim - a 20 - year - old man - contacted the charity @entity58 and told them he was being exploited			2
more victims soon came forwards and others were identified , helping officers to build a case which identified the principle suspects			2
sickening : det sgt @entity65 , of @entity66 , said these offences do not belong in modern @entity4 among those exploited was a 45 - year - old woman who was kept prisoner and forced to do housework for free			2
she was not given clothes and was only fed once a day during her captivity			0
she was later given more freedom and was eventually able to flee and catch a train away from the town			0
the court heard a @entity3 man was put up in @entity36 and forced to work for more than 21 weeks for just £ 30 and lost more than 10 kilos in weight			1
both @entity14 , of @entity42 , and @entity13 , of @entity37 , admitted charges of conspiracy to traffic people within the @entity4 for exploitation dating back to 2011			1
the pair were due to face a six - week trial with 13 witnesses who had been trafficked by the pair , until they pleaded guilty			0
@entity13 was also guilty of blackmail and converting criminal property			1
the court heard he made at least £ 60,000 from the conspiracy , which was sent out of the country using a @entity95 account			2
sentencing him , judge @entity48 said : ' this was a criminal enterprise from the outset			0
having got people to come to this country you were in effect number one in the gang over here			0
' these people were forced to work by being in an atmosphere of fear of being beaten or having no alternative economic means of moving away			1
' illes was described by judge @entity48 as @entity13 ’s ' right hand man '			1
he was in charge when @entity13 was away and drove victims to and from work			1
judge @entity48 added : ' you were aware of the conditions in which these people were living and the conditions in which they were working yet you were prepared to work for this gang , albeit acting under instructions from @entity32			2
' det sgt @entity65 , of @entity66 , added : ' we are pleased to see the conviction of @entity13 and @entity122 today for offences which , quite simply , should not be taking place in 21st century @entity4			2
' @entity125 director of operations @entity125 said after the case : ' with upwards of 30 or 40 people living in a two - bedroom house , can you imagine the smell , the overcrowding , the dirt ? ' people were living on scraps of food or slop that was reheated again and again			0
' you would n’t let animals be kept in those conditions			0
this case highlights the issues of human trafficking and i know people hearing this sickening story today will be shocked that slavery is happening in their towns			0
' but the fact of the matter is that human trafficking is a significant and unacceptable problem in @entity4 in the 21st century			0
' det chief insp @entity151 of @entity66 , added : ' these convictions have followed a long running , detailed and at times , difficult investigation and i want to thank partners including @entity58 , who have worked with us to bring this case to a conclusion			0
' i would encourage anyone who feels they may be a victim of this type of trafficking and is being exploited to contact @entity166 anonymously on 0800 555 111			0
' west yorkshire police and crime commissioner @entity167 , who is spearheading the creation of the national working group to tackle human trafficking , said : ' this very sad case demonstrates yet again that human trafficking is an issue which exists within @entity9 and that fact can not be ignored			0
