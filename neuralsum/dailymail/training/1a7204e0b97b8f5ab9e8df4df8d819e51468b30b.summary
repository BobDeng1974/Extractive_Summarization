more @entity1 than not believe that harsh interrogation tactics used by the @entity3 during the @entity5 administration were ' justified ' and produced worthwhile intelligence , even if they were ' torture , ' a poll released today shows			1
survey - takers discovered that a plurality of interviewees believe the brutal interrogations were justified , 49 percent , and resulted in reliable intelligence , 57 percent			1
but even while giving the @entity3 their blessing to forcefully question suspected terrorists , nearly seven in 10 in @entity1 said they consider waterboarding - one of the 13 approved @entity5 - era techniques - to be ' torture , ' a @entity14 poll found			1
republicans were most likely to approve of the program that was carried out in the wake of the sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks during @entity30 president @entity5 's tenure , 75 percent , followed by @entity35 , 54 percent , and independent voters , 50 percent			2
similarly , @entity30 were least likely to say that waterboarding constitutes torture and that terrorism suspects should have the same rights as other suspected criminals			0
legal rights for detainees with known terrorist ties was not popular with respondents of any political persuasion , however , and 56 percent of all @entity1 questioned said they were not in favor of such a measure			1
a second survey performed by @entity49 revealed similar attitudes among @entity1			0
that poll found that 51 percent backed the @entity3 's use of the so - called enhanced interrogation techniques compared to the 29 percent who said they were ' not justified			1
' a fifth of those polled said they did not know what to think			0
the same survey discovered that 56 percent of @entity1 believe that the aggressive treatment led terrorism suspects to provide ' intelligence that prevented terrorist attacks			2
' likewise , 28 percent said they agreed with a @entity67 report released that claims it did not , and 16 percent said said they were unsure			0
and as in the @entity14 poll , those surveyed were more likely to be in favor of the @entity3 program if they self - identified as @entity30 , 76 percent , than were @entity35 , 37 percent , or independents , 49 percent			1
republicans were more likely than @entity35 or independents to say that the measures were justified and helped to prevent future terrorist attacks respondents to the @entity49 poll were split over whether the @entity67 should have released a declassified , 600 - page version review of the @entity3 program at all , with 42 percent saying they were for it and 43 percent saying they were against it			2
perhaps more revealing was the percentage of @entity1 who told @entity49 that they kept a close eye on the national debate following the tuesday release of the @entity67 document at all : 23 percent			0
the report took a back seat , @entity49 discovered , to news on the monthly jobs numbers and on protests against police brutality .			0

nearly seven in 10 in @entity1 said they consider waterboarding - one of the 13 approved @entity5 - era techniques - to be ' torture '
majorities also consider waterboarding , threatening to sexually assault detainees ' mothers , forced ice water baths and sleep deprivation torture
a plurality of interviewees believe the brutal interrogations were justified , 49 percent , and resulted in reliable intelligence , 57 percent , however
