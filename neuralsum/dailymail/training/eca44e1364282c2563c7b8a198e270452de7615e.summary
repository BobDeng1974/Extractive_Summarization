the court heard that police found 38 video files of @entity6 , which all appeared to have been taken at a time when she was around 15 years of age			1
mr @entity30 said : ‘ they involved the setting up of covert cameras so she was being filmed in her bedroom where she would be undressing for bed , and in the bathroom when she would be naked and using the toilet			1
’ on @entity6 ’s 16th birthday , a camera which had been installed pointing towards her bed , was discovered			1

he disconnected the camera , but retained the memory card which contained videos of @entity6 , the court heard			1

@entity6 questioned what @entity24 's motives might really have been in the period of time she lived with him when she might have given him a kiss or a hug ‘ @entity25 began to notice the defendant was spending an increasingly long period of time alone at his computer screen , ’ he said			1
‘ he would always close the screen when she walked in			2
‘ in october 2013 , her suspicions now being raised all the time as to what sort of material was found on his computer she asked two friends to come to the home when she was out to find out what files and folders were on the computer			2
’ the court heard how @entity24 , a railway construction engineer , also subscribed to paying websites which allowed him to access images of children			2
this material included photographs of girls as young as six , some naked and some in bikinis and underwear , posing provocatively			0
defending @entity24 , @entity128 said : ‘ he was a man of exemplary previous character			0
that was until he developed an extremely unhealthy interest in internet porn over four years			0
‘ he spent most of the week , and some of the weekends , away from home and did feel very isolated and lonely on occasions			0
‘ he had little or no active sex life due to the nature of his job and having to work away and this led to him looking at adult porn sites which in the end became pretty obsessive ‘ he stumbled across a site that featured a child pornographic image			0
he realises he should have stopped at that point and not taken it any further			0
‘ all this became fairly normalised in his mind			0
he did n’t think he was doing anything seriously wrong			0

‘ on examination of the material from your home revealed a vast collection of photographs and videos of young children and your step daughter in her home , dressing , washing and using the toilet			1
‘ you treated her as your daughter and she treated you as her father			0
i ’m dealing with a very bad breach of trust			0
’ speaking after the case , ms @entity25 said : ‘ i ’m livid with the sentence			0
