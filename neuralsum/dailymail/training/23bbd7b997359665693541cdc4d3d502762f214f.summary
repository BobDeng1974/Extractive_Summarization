she 's outselling @entity1 and has penned the fastest selling debut since @entity3 but just a year ago , @entity0 was struggling to make ends meet			1
a would - be actress moonlighting as a @entity7 to get by , the 31 - year - old @entity5 spent her evenings writing and re-writing the novel that would become this summer 's biggest selling debut , the @entity11			1
no - one is more surprised by her success than @entity14 , who says the last few months been ' a dream ' while describing the @entity17 's popularity as ' totally unexpected '			1
selling well : @entity0 's debut novel @entity11 is currently outselling @entity19 and @entity1 bestseller : @entity0 's book , @entity22 , is currently number two in the book charts ' i did n't expect anything beyond it being published , ' says @entity14 , modestly			1
' that had always been the dream			2
' then for it to become a bestseller ... i had n't even thought about it			1
i had learned to manage my expectations , so all this is completely wonderful			2
' with the @entity17 currently sitting second in the book charts , life for @entity14 now consists of writing hard and flitting from interview to party			1
it 's all a far cry from her previous life as a struggling actress and sometime @entity7			1
' the phone was n't ringing much for acting auditions , ' she admits			2
' i had fallen a little out of love with the game of it and it made me feel powerless in my own life			2
' with her days taken up by admin and auditions , @entity14 used her evenings to sketch out the draft of the book that would become @entity11 , a 17th century yarn set in @entity57 that revolves around a tiny dolls ' house given to the heroine by her husband			1
' @entity62 was a private expression of creativity when i was working in offices as a @entity7 , ' adds @entity14			1
' i had hoped to one day to catch the attention of a literary agent but it would have been crazy just to announce " i 'm going to a writer now " because it 's as unreliable as acting ! ' instead , she kept plugging away and , after four years of drafting version after version , finally had a manuscript to send out			1
surprisingly in light of the book 's enormous success , @entity14 at first met with rejection			1
' i had polite rejections from literary agents and was sometimes just met with a wall of silence , ' she explains			2
' but all you need is one gesture of encouragement to carry on			2
i could n't do much else with myself other than act and write , so i just carried on			2
' succour came in the shape of literary agent @entity89 , who took her on after reading the first three chapters of @entity22			2
inspiration : @entity0 's debut novel was inspired by her travels in @entity57 and is set in a 17th century version from there , things began to snowball with @entity98 securing a six - figure publishing deal with @entity100 following an intense bidding war			1
@entity14 , you ca n't help but sense , is still happily reeling at her unexpected success			1
nevertheless , she says she wo n't be resting on her laurels and is already hard at work on another book			1
' it 's called @entity111 , ' she reveals of novel number two			1
' it 's about an artist who is disgraced and disappears during the @entity115			1
' 30 years on , a woman with a secret finds her life thrown into turmoil when his missing works turn up in her @entity5 gallery			2
it 's about art and identity , war , and finding love and friendship in unorthodox places			1
' but with a tour of the @entity132 planned for september and requests for appearances and signings flooding in , it might be a while before readers can get their hands on it			0
in the meantime , @entity14 is off on a well - earned holiday with boyfriend @entity142 and says she 'll be catching up on a reading list of her own			1
heroes : @entity0 says @entity146 ( left ) is one of her heroes , as is @entity148 author @entity1 ( right ) busy : @entity0 's next stop is a tour of the @entity132 , after which she will go back to writing her second novel ' my all time favourites are @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , ' declares the avid reader , mischievously adding : ' but that 's just today ! ' she credits her love of reading with her writing success but says she still has some way to go before becoming comfortable with the idea of being favourably compared to another of her favourite writers - @entity148 author @entity1			1
' i think i 've a long , long way to go before i can even consider that compliment , ' she laughs , gracefully brushing off the comparison			0
' she 's one of my heroes			1
' despite her protests , it remains an apt comparison			0
like @entity1 , she has enjoyed tremendous success with her debut novel and , like the @entity181 author , has seen her life transformed			1
' it 's funny really , ' she adds			1
' i feel like the same person but , yet , with more freedom and more responsibilities			0
' life has opened up a bit			0
obviously the nod of acknowledgment from the publishing world has made a huge difference to my self - esteem			0
' i knew i could create things , i just needed someone to give me that chance			0
but on a day to day basis , i hope my friends would say i 'm exactly the same as i ever was			0
' @entity0 's debut novel @entity22 is published by @entity100 and costs £ 12.99 publishing star : literary agent @entity89 , 27 , knows a thing or two about getting books published like her client @entity0 , @entity89 is one of the literary world 's up - and - coming stars , albeit on the publishing side			1
a literary agent working for the @entity208 , @entity89 is the woman behind @entity14 's six - figure deal and knows better than anyone what it takes to pen a best seller			1
here , she reveals how to hit the big time with books : plan your novel ' decide on your genre , world and characters before you start writing			1
many novelists run out of steam in a few chapters because the story wo n't sustain them over more than a few thousand words			0
carry a notebook around with you and start paying attention to interesting stories , bits of conversation , or paintings : anything which sparks your imagination			0
be on the lookout for the fascinating and the absurd			0
some ideas wo n't be sustainable but some will be fertile ground for the imagination			0
know your story a lot of novels i get sent meander along			0
know what your plot is and the journey which your characters are going on			0
you should know what the stakes are and why the reader will care about them			0
build in suspense , keep the reader guessing			0
i know when i have something special on my desk when it stops feeling like work – i remember reading the full manuscript of @entity258 by @entity259 when she submitted it and i printed it out to carry on reading it on the tube			1
it was no surprise to me when it went on to sell to 24 countries , with @entity264 making the film			0
become a reader the best writers are big readers			0
look at novels which sell and those which do n't , join a book group , browse bookshops and become comfortable with genre			0
i see a lot of submissions which say ' i have written a [ insert genre here ] novel but i have never read [ insert genre here ] '			0
you are shooting yourself in the foot			0
learn what works from other writers , what the tropes are and how to subvert them , and your own work will become stronger			1
do n't write to @entity287 often get hung up on the bestseller lists but those books will have been commissioned 12 - 18 months earlier so you are already writing to something that is out of date			1
the best books can define trends or set new ones			2
research the industry is self - publishing right for you ? consider how to market and sell your work and if you expect to be able to reach a wide audience through @entity301 sales			2
if you want to be traditionally published you need to find a literary agent			0
find out which agencies accept submissions and how to send them your work - there 's no point sending your @entity309 novel to someone who handles romance			1
put the effort into submitting your novel that you would into applying for a job : proofread , edit , check , double - check			0
submit the strongest work you can			2
gone are the days when agents were faceless entities : now you can meet them at writing festivals or connect with them on @entity323			2
learn from rejection writing is a long process and the road to success is littered with rejection			0
some of my bestselling authors had years of rejections before i signed them : @entity334 's novel , @entity333 of @entity335 , will publish next year in 14 languages and she is in her 60s			2
@entity0 had a novel before the @entity22 which no agent signed			1
no one likes rejection but if you love writing , keep persevering and figure out why this book has n’t been a success			0
as an agent i get hundreds of rejections from publishers , but it just makes me want to work harder to find the right book			2
keep trying i 'm always on the lookout for the next big thing			0
my entire client list came from unsolicited submissions and i am passionate about finding new voices			0
none of my authors got signed for their first book , and in some cases , the book i signed them for originally was n't the one that sold to a publisher			0
every writer has a rejection folder but you learn from everything you write and you will improve with every book			0
love what you do if you go into publishing with the belief you 're going to make lots of money , you are liable to be disappointed			2
some of my authors do make six or even seven figures from their writing , but the vast majority work a day job too			1
what needs to keep you going is your passion for writing			0
one of my authors told me that even if her next book did n't sell she would still carry on writing - writing brought her so much joy that the deal was just the cherry on the cake			0
i only sign books which i feel passionately about			0
i work hard for my authors because i want them to succeed and nothing beats the moment you call someone in the middle of their working day and say " are you sitting down ? i have some wonderful news			1
