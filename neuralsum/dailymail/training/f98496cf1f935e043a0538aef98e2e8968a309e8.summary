by @entity0 the novelty song ‘ yes , we have no bananas ’ was written in the 1920s about a shortage of the fruit after a blight in @entity8			2
but it may need a modern reprise as a fungus is spreading across the planet and could lead to a critical shortage and affect the livelihoods of millions			0
an international delegation of scientists have met in @entity17 to formulate a plan to contain an outbreak in @entity20 , as fear that the disease could spread to @entity23 grows			1
is bananageddon on the horizon ? an incurable fungus called @entity27 is spreading across the planet devastating banana plants , which could lead to a critical shortage of the fruit and affect the livelihoods of millions of people @entity27 or @entity33 has been sweeping through banana plantations in @entity35 since around 2005 before spreading to @entity36 and ruining the industry in the @entity39 region			1
it has been devastating plantations since the 1980s in @entity41 , but scientists are unsure of its origin			0
the fungus infects the roots of the @entity48 variety of the plants and then moves upwards through the xylem , clogging the sap flow and causes leaves to wilt and rot			0
it can lie dormant in plants for up to three years and possibly in soil			0
a report suggests that a 3,600 acre plantation in @entity20 is infested with @entity27			1
‘ the future looks bleak ’ and the disease could spread to crops beyond @entity20 ’s borders , @entity59 , a @entity17 plant pathologist told @entity61 ’s @entity60 , who has written a book on bananas			1
the incurable disease , also known as @entity33 , has swept banana plantations in @entity35 in 2005 before spreading to @entity36 and ruining the industry in the @entity39 region			1
however , there have been cases of the disease in @entity41 since the 1980s			0
the fungus infects the roots of the @entity48 variety of banana and then moves upwards through the plant 's tissue , clogging the sap flow and causes leaves to wilt and rot			0
bananas generate $ 8billion ( £ 4.7billion ) every year and the @entity84 says more than 400 million people rely on the fruit as their main source of calories			1
hungry for action : bananas generate $ 8billion ( £ 4.7billion ) every year and the @entity84 says more than 400million people rely on the fruit as their main source of calories			1
here , a boy eats a stew of bananas , beans , potatoes and peanuts in @entity101 experts are unsure how the fungus arrived in @entity20 but one theory is that @entity106 workers who arrived in 2008 to build a new plantation accidentally brought it with them			1
the fungus is so infectious that just a single clump of earth could have triggered and infestation			0
another theory is that the disease was lying dormant in the soil all along and scientists are now analysing the strain of the fungus in a bid to find out if it shares genetic markers with samples from elsewhere			2
scientists are trying to come up with a plan of containing an outbreak of @entity27 in @entity20 , which has ravaged banana plants ( stock image ) experts believe the new plantation that has now been decimated by the disease was poorly equipped to contain the spread of the fungus and farms share drainage facilities , which likely spread contaminated water			1
it is thought that the 2,500 workers walked across the land to and from work , unwittingly helping the disease to spread			2
a spokesman from @entity142 , which originally set up the @entity20 plantation , said that @entity27 is of long - term danger to the industry			1
a breed of old - fashioned banana called @entity148 was affected by a similar blight and became functionally extinct by 1960			0
it was replaced by the @entity48 variety , which we eat today			0
@entity142 is now researching a replacement banana called @entity154 219 , which is a little bit sweeter and resistant to the disease , but takes longer to harvest			2
scientists think that the best solution to the problem is variety and in @entity163 for example , approximately 600 varieties of the fruit are available			0
around 45 per cent of the world ’s bananas are the @entity48 variety , so millions could be decimated by the disease			2
as banana workers move between countries , there are fears that the fungus could spread to @entity23 , where bananas are big business			2
and it could already be there as the fungus has an incubation period of between two and three years .			0

scientists have met in @entity17 to come up with a plan of containing an outbreak of @entity27 in @entity20
a report suggests that a *3,600acre* plantation in @entity20 is infested , leading to the *demise* of seven million banana plants
the incurable disease has been sweeping through @entity35 and @entity36 before arriving in @entity17 . experts fear it could reach @entity23
it is thought that workers from the @entity195 could have carried the disease to @entity20
bananas generate $ 8billion ( £ 4.7billion ) and millions of people rely on them as their main source of calories
