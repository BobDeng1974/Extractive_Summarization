by @entity0 a former @entity2 prostitute of 16 years , who now runs a @entity4 nonprofit to help those negatively affected by the industry that nearly killed her , has written about her drastic life - turnaround			1
@entity9 , 46 , is the founder of @entity10 ; a name she admits ' many disagree with ' - which offers support for women in the sex industry , as well as a @entity2 - based safe house for those who wish to escape their situations			1
ms @entity9 , who lost her virginity at 18 , grew up as a self - confessed ' goodie two shoes , ' but her life took a sharp turn when her boyfriend at the time revealed himself as a pimp , and subsequently led her into the dingy world of prostitution			2
poster girl : @entity9 ( pictured ) escaped 16 years of prostitution to form hookers for @entity32 , a nonprofit which provides support and a safe haven for women who wish to escape the sex industry ' i took pop culture 's pill and swallowed it whole , ' writes the buxom blonde of the ' money , presents and parties ' that came with the job			1
ms @entity9 was initially enthralled by what she describes as ' the honeymoon phase ' of her ' glamorous ' life in the sex industry ; during which time she was a stripper , a ' high - class escort ' and a street prostitute , and says she encountered plenty of ' very famous ' men who paid for her services			1
although she confesses she went through a phase of ' sex addiction , ' she claims the practice was never actually enjoyable to her			0
' sex for money is not pleasurable , it is not fun , us girls do not enjoy it , ' she writes			0
' in fact there were many times i just wanted to hurt the man that was touching me			0
' slippery slope : at first , ms @entity9 ( left and right ) was seduced by the ' money , presents and parties ' that came with her life as a call girl , but says that being paid for sex was never ' fun ' before long , she was heading down a dark path ; suffering the traumas of abuse , ' drugs of every kind , ' pornography , anorexia and repeated abortions			1
' sex for money is not pleasurable , it is not fun , us girls do not enjoy it ' ' i was beaten , raped , kidnapped , strangled , suffocated , guns put in my mouth , hair cut off , tied up , gagged , put in trunks of cars , bones broken , spit on , kicked , pushed , stalked by crazy men , ' she writes			0
though she thought things could n't get any worse , ms @entity9 was then diagnosed with @entity97 - a form of cancer which affects the lymph tissue - and even though she recovered , and finally abandoned her career as a prostitute with the help of a former client , things continued to spin downhill			2
trauma : ms @entity9 ( bottom ) soon fell prey to an almost unbelievable chain of bad fortune , including beatings , rapes , abortions , kidnappings and then cancer , but after finding @entity115 , she turned her life around and now campaigns to help others having flirted with the concept of @entity115 over the years , but having not yet fully embraced @entity120 , ms @entity9 thought her wealthy businessman boyfriend and his ' high - society square lifestyle ' would be the answer , literally , to her prayers			2
instead she formed an addiction to cocaine , a substance she describes as ' the drug even the devil himself does not want			0
' following an accidental overdose in 2003 that almost claimed her life , ms @entity9 began to take her faith more seriously			2
she claims the moment her life changed forever came when @entity32 visited her in a dream			0
happily ever after : ms @entity9 ( right ) married her husband @entity135 ( left ) , who is the lead musician in a heavy metal band called @entity137 , in 2009 @entity138 : hookers for @entity32 ( pictured , volunteers for the cause ) was formed after ms @entity141 narrowly survived a drug overdose , an event that eventually lead her to embrace her @entity120 with full force ' when i chose to fully believe that he died in place of me for my sins , it literally blew me away , ' she writes			1
' @entity32 came into my heart ... and he literally took my life back from the devil			0
' ' when i chose to fully believe that he died in place of me for my sins , it literally blew me away ' ms @entity9 founded hookers for @entity32 in 2005 and states its primary mission is : ' to hook ( outreach ) @entity158 ( @entity32 ) @entity159 ( emotional & spiritual restoration ) and @entity161 ) for those who have been negatively affected by sex trafficking and the adult entertainment industry			1
