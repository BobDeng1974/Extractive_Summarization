by @entity0 access denied : @entity2 could benefit 1,000 patients a year but is deemed to lack evidence of benefits a new drug that combats a specific type of lung cancer is too expensive for the @entity9 , says the rationing watchdog			1
@entity2 , which is aimed at patients in their 40s and 50s , halts the advance of the disease for almost eight months – more than double the time for chemotherapy			1
the drug , which was fast - tracked for use in the @entity17 last year , is designed for patients with a specific genetic mutation – non-small cell lung cancer			1
it is estimated that 1,000 patients could benefit each year from @entity2 , which costs £ 4,000 a month			1
but the @entity22 claims it is unclear how much benefit the drug gives to patients so it is not deemed to be cost - effective			2
almost one in seven people with the disease were never smokers or light smokers who gave up , but like all sufferers the cancer is often diagnosed late when it has spread			0
for three - quarters of all new cases , five - year survival rates are as low as five per cent because the cancer is advanced			0
dr @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , said ‘ in an aggressive disease like advanced lung cancer , where , for the majority of patients , survival is exceptionally poor and where not all patients can expect to gain much benefit with existing therapies , there is an urgent need for new medicines like crizotinib which target the specific drivers of a patient ’s tumour			1
‘ clinicians recognise that the future of cancer treatment lies in these types of targeted medicines			0
‘ if this preliminary guidance is upheld , it potentially signals a setback to the advancement of cancer medicine in the @entity61			0
’ currently many patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( @entity64 will have a second round of chemotherapy which threatens hair loss and other side effects - some life - threatening			1
rapid help : the new drug halts the advance for non-small cell lung cancer for eight months , more than double the time for chemotherapy the drug is designed for @entity64 patients with a specific genetic mutation , of which at least two thirds of patients respond to crizotinib compared with just a fifth having chemo , with far fewer side effects			1
they show a doubling of time on average before the cancer progressed , up from three months to 7.7 months			0
around 41,500 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year , including 14 per cent of patients who were never smokers			2
it is estimated that 1,000 patients could benefit each year from the new drug , which costs just over £ 4,000 a month			1
chemotherapy costs more than £ 1,000 a month but is being given to hundreds of patients who will get little or no benefit , according to experts			2
improving life : the drug is designed for lung cancer patients with a specific genetic mutation , of which at least two thirds of patients respond to crizotinib with far fewer side effects			2
dr @entity99 , medical director , @entity100 which makes the drug , said ‘ personalised medicines are developed specifically for selected subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit , sparing those in whom they will have no effect			0
‘ we believe this approach is better for patients and offers better value for the @entity9 , a concept in keeping with @entity22 ’s purpose			0
‘ we are committed to working through the @entity22 consultation process to address the uncertainties within this preliminary recommendation			0
’ the drug , has been granted a conditional licence by the @entity119 drug regulatory body because it serves an ‘ unmet clinical need ’ which is expected shortly to become a full licence			0
lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the @entity61 , accounting for more than a fifth of all cancer deaths .			2
