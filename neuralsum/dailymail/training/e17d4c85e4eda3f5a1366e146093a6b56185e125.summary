by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have desperately needed a leader this season , but @entity5 did n’t even bother applying for the job			1
it would have been the perfect way for @entity5 to repay the club after they stood by him during his drug test ban all those years ago			1
after messing @entity12 about last year , and turning his back on @entity14 , i expected @entity5 to become a regular and a leader for @entity2			1
instead he ’s tweeting about toilet smells and celebrity @entity18			2
leading the way : @entity2 need @entity5 to be a strong captain on and off the field toilet humour : @entity5 asks @entity23 a hypothetical question about toilet smells television observations : @entity5 offers his insight into reality tv show celebrity @entity18 sir @entity30 speaks very highly of @entity31 , describing his ‘ unquestionable class ’ in his autobiography last year			1
he also highlighted the extent of @entity31 ’s focus away from football – scoffing at plans to go to the @entity38 to meet rapper @entity39 : ‘ is he going to make you a better centre half ? ’ @entity30 asked			2
when @entity31 met @entity39 : sir @entity30 questioned @entity5 's motives for meeting rapper @entity39 there ’s nothing wrong with players having interests outside football , unless of course they take your focus away from the game			1
@entity30 felt so concerned he instructed @entity31 ’s agent to run all of the centre half ’s activities away from football by him first			2
here ’s the truth about @entity5 ’s career : he ’s been brilliant for @entity2			1
his partnership with @entity60 has been rock solid in a period of @entity2 domination			1
arguably the best centre half pairing in @entity66 history			2
for @entity14 he ’s been one of many who failed to live up to expectation , which is disappointing			2
if you ’re thinking he ’s past it , think again			0
@entity31 played a lot of games last year – over 30 – and was so good he made the @entity74 team of the year			0
he also earned a new contract extension from @entity76			1
sir @entity30 described it as @entity31 ’s best ever season for @entity2			1
he ’s now averaging one game a month for his club , sometimes watching the whole game from the subs ’ bench			0
@entity31 ’s out with a knee injury right now , but without wishing to be disrespectful , nobody is missing him			0
i ca n’t help thinking that even though injuries might make things hard for @entity31 , he should be the leader on and off the field during these difficult times for @entity2			1
last season proved he ’s still got the ability and the fitness , but his major contribution off the field this season has been to question @entity76 ’ way of telling the players who ’s in the team			1
@entity31 wo n’t like this but in terms of leadership , playing through the pain and proving people wrong , he could learn a huge lesson from @entity108 on the pitch			0
showing how it should be done : @entity108 has been a consistent performer for @entity111 this season fan favourite : the @entity111 fans show their affection towards @entity108 with a banner at @entity116 the @entity111 captain has been magnificent , playing every minute of every game in the @entity66 so far this season , when many thought he was finished			1
i ca n’t help thinking @entity31 has underachieved – we should be talking about him as a leader , a captain , a rock			2
he should be out there setting the example for others			0
but it seems he has failed to convince @entity129 of his value			2
when he ’s on @entity23 asking inane questions about wee and poo i ’m not surprised			0
it ’s harmless ‘ fun ’ i suppose			0
sadly it all contributes to the probability that @entity31 will be remembered most for an eight month ban , rather than being a @entity2 legend			1
two of the best : @entity60 and @entity5 were one of the best centre back pairings in the league bench boy : @entity5 has averaged just a one game a month this season celeb scene : @entity5 and @entity149 star @entity148 catch up in @entity150 when @entity5 was coming through the youth system at @entity153 @entity152 confidently predicted : ‘ he ’ll be the best defender in @entity155 one day			1
’ i do n’t think that prediction quite came true			0
and this season , @entity5 seems to be letting a golden opportunity to prove any doubters wrong pass him by			1
having recently seen a @entity66 game at @entity162 you ca n’t help but be impressed by the stadium , the fans and the aura around this huge club			1
they ’ve tasted @entity170 drama , and @entity172 finals in recent memory			2
but the only thing missing on @entity175 is a sustained period of real success , and trophies of course			0
and that ’s why @entity181 is so keen to leave			1
in simple terms , he is way too good for @entity162			2
i feel for the @entity162 fans			2
big loss : @entity181 looks set to swap @entity162 for @entity186 this month waving goodbye : @entity187 has shown disregard for cup competitions this season i said last week in this column that @entity187 ’s disregard for cup competitions would mean top players have no reason to stay			1
if any @entity195 fan has to pay £ 93 to get into the @entity196 to watch their team ’s @entity172 fifth round tie next month then @entity199 should be disqualified from the competition			1
it really is that simple			0
i ca n’t help thinking @entity181 ’s stay at @entity162 has been a missed opportunity			1
he ’s the kind of player you can build a top four team around , a cup winning team around			0
@entity187 failed to do that , and @entity210 did n’t offer the right investment to build a successful team			1
@entity162 fans have been lucky to have @entity181 – they will miss him , and so will the @entity66			1
what a chance missed by everyone in charge at @entity217			0
@entity218 is going to look like a fool if @entity111 win nothing this season			1
by selling @entity222 to @entity223 has sent out a clear statement that he can be successful without such a talented player			1
at their best last season , @entity222 , @entity226 and @entity227 were a joy to watch			2
@entity218 felt the need to break it up and dispense with @entity222			1
this is the @entity222 : @entity76 poses with new @entity2 signing @entity222 this guy has been a match winner , a man for the big occasion , a man who could create and score , a player you would happily pay money to see			1
but apparently he ’s not good enough for what @entity218 wants			2
it ’s no surprise : @entity218 is a winner , and he finds a way to achieve success			2
it ’s not as pretty as @entity249 ’s method of lifting trophies , but he is a consistent champion doing it his way			0
oscar winner : @entity255 midfielder @entity226 is @entity218 's first choice for the no 10 role at @entity111 there are not many managers around who would feel comfortable leaving a player of @entity222 ’s quality out of the starting line - up			1
@entity218 did n’t just leave him out of the @entity264 , he sold him to @entity2			1
i still think @entity111 will win the title , but if they end up with no trophies this season , everyone will have the right to point the finger at @entity218 and accuse him of making a huge blunder selling @entity222			1
bringing pressure on himself : @entity218 will be the one to blame if @entity111 fail to win anything this season on top of that he will also stand accused of lacking the creative coaching knowledge needed to get the best out of such a talent			1
you have to admire @entity218 for heaping that pressure on himself			1
if you have concerns about the future of the society we live in then you should want @entity23 to show more willingness to clean up its act			2
i ’m not talking about people bantering about football or debating the game			0
i ’m talking about the disgusting responses to some of those debates			0
it seems to be acceptable that a whole new generation is growing up thinking mild or vile abuse posted online to people they ’ve never met is acceptable			2
staying loyal : @entity300 signed a new deal at @entity302 despite interest from @entity2 sadly the people running social media forums and the people running the country are reinforcing the message that such abuse is acceptable by doing nothing to prevent it or punish it			1
one example from this week : on my @entity314 radio show we asked if @entity300 had ‘ bottled it ’ by staying at @entity302 and not seeking a move to a club regularly winning trophies and playing in the @entity170			0
my view was that @entity300 ’ wish to stay at @entity302 and help them try to achieve greatness was admirable			0
remarkably some @entity302 fans thought this was a signal for them to fire abuse at me			0
one threatening tweet suggested i should ‘ watch out ’ next time i ’m at @entity328			0
whoever posted it later deleted it			0
i ’ve seen pundits threatened with murder because they tweet about football			0
i ’ve seen anonymous tweeters start campaigns falsely accusing ex-pros and pundits of being paedophiles because they offer an opinion on football			0
i ’ve seen grown men who claim to be a ‘ proud father ’ in their @entity23 profile tweet all sorts of vile , disgusting abuse and threats to people they do n’t even know , simply because they disagree with a football opinion			2
@entity351 help their children who will be growing up using a man with no moral compass whatsoever as a role model			0
they wo n’t know right from wrong			0
i ’ve even seen tweets saying pundits should expect to be threatened with murder if they offer an opinion on football			0
a debate about football is exactly that			0
how an individual can possibly think it is right to shift that debate into something sinister is beyond me			0
for me personally , i can try to educate people to be decent and just talk about football rather than be abusive , but i ca n’t possibly get upset about a total stranger with a sick mind tweeting abuse to me			0
but not everyone is as strong			0
if one day these unchecked threats lead to the suicide of someone receiving them , or an aggressive twitter user decides to follow through with a threat for real , then @entity23 , and all those who choose to ignore the message i ’m conveying here , will have blood on their hands			0
i sincerely hope that sickening scenario never comes true .			0

@entity5 has failed to be the leader @entity76 needs at @entity2
stars like @entity181 will continue to leave @entity162 while @entity187 shows no interest in the cups
@entity199 should be thrown out of @entity172 for ticket prices
@entity111 's @entity218 is putting the pressure on himself by selling @entity222
why these vile twits need to clean up their act
