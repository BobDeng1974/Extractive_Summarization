children of the 1970s and 1980s will likely remember the chunky , plastic @entity2 magnets that adorned fridges in family homes			1
the popular toys were designed to help teach children to read and spell			0
but for some people , they had another unintended consequence ; the magnets forever changed the colours that people would associate with letters			1
the child with the hood in this photo was born in 1988 and is an adult synesthete			0
his colour - letter pairings matched 25 of the 26 letters in the @entity2 magnet set , which is in the foreground at least that 's the conclusion of a study on synaesthesia - a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together			1
for instance , some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words			0
others experience tastes , smells or shapes			0
it is believe that around one in 10,000 of people have synaesthesia , and scientists are still unsure exactly what causes some people to perceive two senses at the same time			1
a large amount of research , according to @entity44 , has previously suggested the condition can be learned , rather than being the result of genetic factors			0
this graphic shows the results for 400 synesthetes with 10 or more letters matching the toy			2
the rows correspond to participants and columns to letters			0
the colours along the bottom represent the most frequently chosen colour label for each letter the latest study adds to that body of work by suggesting the toy caused a generation to foreever link a with red , f with purple and p with green			1
researchers from the @entity72 at @entity73 used data from 6,588 registered users to determine which colours are most commonly associated with which letters			2
they then compared these colour - letter matches to fridge magnets sold by @entity2 between 1971 and 1990			1
the results revealed that at least six per cent ( 400 out of the 6588 participants ) learnt ' many of their matches ' from the @entity2 set			1
among those born in the decade after the toy began to be manufactured , the proportion of synesthetes with learned letter - colour pairings was closer to 15 per cent			1
the colours in the toy ( upper row ) , the average colour choice for each letter from the 6188 synesthetes ( middle row ) , and the most commonly assigned colour for each letter for the 400 synesthetes are shown here			1
@entity100 shows when the choice does not match the toy ( bottom row ) red bars show proportion of participants with 10 or more matches to the magnet set			2
@entity110 bars show participants with seven or more matches			0
for participants born between 1970 and 1985 , the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the @entity2 set can exceed 15 per cent synaesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more senses experienced separately are involuntarily joined together			1
for instance , some synaesthetes experience colour when they hear sounds or read words			0
others experience tastes , smells or shapes			0
some people are born with synaesthesia , while others experience it after a stroke , or while using psychedelic drugs such as @entity133			2
famous synaesthetes include singers @entity135 and @entity137			0
there have also been studies in which researchers claimed to have taught people to be synaesthetic - and as a result it is a widely contested condition			2
reports claim it can affect as many as one in 23 people and has been linked with high - levels of creativity and intelligence			2
but among those born five years or more before it was manufactured , none of the colour - letter matches were aligned with the colours used in the set			1
' analysis of the letter - colour matching data suggests the only difference between synesthetes with matches to the toy and those without is exposure to the stimulus , ' explained the paper			1
' this indicates learning of letter - colour pairings from external [ sources ] can occur in a substantial fraction of synesthetic , and are consistent with the hypothesis that synesthesia is a kind of conditioned mental imagery			2
' the authors did point out , however , that there may have been other cues – such as cultural influences , or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role			0
they also said their findings do n't suggest that colourful toys cause synaesthesia			0
instead the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors the authors did point out that there may have been other cues – such as cultural influences , or other popular toys or magnet sets that played a role			0

synaesthesia is a condition in which separate senses are linked
scientists determined which colours are usually connected with letters
they then compared these colour - letter matches to @entity2 magnets
they claim 6 *%* of people learnt their matches from the @entity2 toy
