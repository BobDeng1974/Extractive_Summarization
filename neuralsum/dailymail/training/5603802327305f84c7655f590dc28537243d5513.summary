@entity15 , who owns the @entity16 in @entity17 , backed calls for an inquiry into disgraced @entity20 chief @entity4 , who was put in charge of @entity6 by @entity7			1
‘ there is something wrong with the judgment of a government that puts a bad man like that in charge of public money when he has duped innocent people like me and others out of enormous sums , ’ said 71 - year - old mr @entity15			2
‘ the man is a devious b * * * * * * and had all the hallmarks of a conman			0
there should be an inquiry to establish the truth			0
’ meanwhile , another businessman today speaks of how @entity4 conned him out of another £ 250,000			1
the @entity42 revealed last week how @entity4 , who ran the @entity7 family stockbroking firm , was made chairman of the £ 60 billion quango despite being declared bankrupt			1

the prime minister hoped his instant dismissal of @entity4 – who was also the @entity65 ’ chief operating officer when mr @entity7 became party leader – would end the row , but @entity42 has established the scandal is much deeper			1
the picture now is of an unscrupulous man in cahoots with shady figures who cheated innocent people out of vast sums – and tried to lie his way out of it			0
it raises key questions : why did @entity7 trust @entity4 with such a vast amount of public money ? did @entity4 use his privileged @entity83 role to abuse taxpayers ’ money ? and did friends in high places cover up his activities ? the pressure for an inquiry into @entity4 grew after new details emerged of how he : a vivid account of the misery caused by @entity4 is provided by @entity15 and wife @entity94			1
they set up their vineyard 14 years ago , which has become one of @entity99 ’s most successful winemakers – but they were rocked when @entity4 cheated them out of £ 100,000			1
charge sheet : the complaints against @entity10 crony @entity4 investigated by @entity42 they say they were persuaded to lend him the money in 2010 by their financial adviser			1
what they did n’t know was that the adviser was , like @entity4 , soon to be embroiled in a separate financial scandal			0
mr @entity15 recalls : ‘ he said @entity4 was worth about £ 2 million , had deals going through and would soon pay me back , so i agreed			1
’ the couple say their adviser played up @entity4 ’s role as former head of @entity118 stockbrokers , which employed three generations of @entity120 , including the prime minister ’s father @entity121			1
’ so they lent @entity4 the money – but ‘ then he stopped paying interest			2
‘ another man told me @entity4 did the same to him			2
we were told he was paying cheques into his wife ’s account			2
they are both “ a @entity4			0
” ‘ it turned out he already had huge debts when i lent him money			0
if i ’d known i would n’t have gone near him			0
’ vineyard owners : @entity94 and @entity15 lost out when they lent @entity4 £ 100,000 when @entity4 was quizzed at a bankruptcy hearing in february 2012 , it seemed he could not even remember @entity15 ’s name			1

” he was definitely close to @entity158			2
he said “ @entity159 [ @entity160 ] told me she wants one of your computers , but can she have it in pink ? ” or he ’d say , “ i saw @entity167 [ @entity166 ] at the weekend			1
” he mentioned @entity7 a couple of times			0
’ the businessman described how @entity4 persuaded him to lend him £ 250,000 – which he is still waiting to get back			2
‘ i knew he had a senior job at the @entity10 and he was very plausible			2
he rang me in summer 2010 and asked to borrow £ 250,000 for a deal			0
i said , “ no problem			0
” ‘ a few weeks after that , he came to @entity174 with me			0
he phoned from @entity176 airport to say thanks			0
that was the last i heard from him			0

he said he could n’t attend court because he had a boil on his bum			0
‘ he is a @entity189			0
he said he had a collection of vintage @entity192 cars , but there is no trace of it			0
he is intelligent , but has a fatal flaw			0
perhaps being too close to political power , and the need for money to maintain his position , affected his judgment			0
