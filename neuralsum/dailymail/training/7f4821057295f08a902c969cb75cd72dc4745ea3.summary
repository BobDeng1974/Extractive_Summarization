@entity10 has tried returning to her earlier life as 16 - year - old @entity13 high school student , but the memory of her abduction and the lingering questions about her brother and mother 's murders continue to creep their way into her daily conversations			1
after being rescued by @entity25 agents in @entity26 on august 10 , @entity23 made a semi-public re-entry to the world via social media , and after a month of silence , she has come back			1
when one woman asked @entity23 why did she ' never run ' away from her captor @entity10 - saying that ' he never have you handcuff or anything - @entity23 snapped back			1
' how do you know he never had me handcuffed ? because there you are wrong			0
do n't assume things you do n't know			0
just stop , ' she wrote			2
in another , a user accused her father of ' mooching off other people ' and she responded : ' why do n't you shut the f * * * up and get the facts right			0
he 's trying a * * * * * *			0
why do n't you get a life instead harassing people ? ( sic ) ' much loved : the teenage girl has posted many pictures of her late brother and mom who were killed by a family friend remembering the other victims : @entity10 regularly posts old pictures of her mother @entity76 and brother @entity77 , both of whom were killed by her captor before he fled with her to @entity26 signs of trouble : she regularly posts inspirational messages hinting at her inner anguish though her re-emergence on @entity46 came only four days ago , @entity23 has been an active user on @entity34 , regularly posting smiling selfies with friends to her nearly 9,000 followers			1
there have been hints of emotional struggles , however , as she regularly posts old pictures of her mother @entity90 and brother @entity77 , both of whom were tied , beaten and their bodies burnt			1
' just because i am strong enough to handle pain does n't mean i deserve it [ sic ] , ' read one recent post			0
some of that pain is self - inflicted , as she admitted to reading the autopsy report about the deaths where the medical examiner detailed the way in which they were beaten before @entity35 set the house on fire and drove off with @entity10			1
she said that ' i need to know what happened to them '			0
the question - and - answer style social media site is popular among teens but it has been gaining a larger audience as it has been cited in a number of cases of bullying that have resulted in suicides			0
happier moments : @entity23 shared these pictures of herself and her boyfriend at their homecoming dance grieving : @entity10 posted this picture with her brother @entity77 and this message : ' ca n't get you off my mind tonight			1
i just wan na see you so bad			0
it 's not the same and it never will be			0
i love you with all my heart ' @entity23 's conversation shows that she is a target for such internet trolls as well , with a number taking issue with the smiling , cheery photos that she has posted in the days and weeks following the family tragedy			1

dead : @entity25 agents shot and killed @entity35 after they discovered him with @entity10 in @entity26 days after kidnapping her from @entity13 ' sad that you do n't even know me and run your mouth but i give you props for having balls to talk s * * * over ask lol , ' she responded			1
another talking point was the optics of how she walked into the memorial fundraiser for her mother and brother wearing short jean shorts and holding a cup from @entity158			2
' my friend randomly showed up with @entity158 and i guess she got me one , ' @entity23 wrote in one post , and continued by saying in another : ' yeah it 's stupid what was i suppose ( sic ) to do ? just throw it away when she gave it to me ? people just find the littlest reasons to bash on me ( sic )			1
' her social media presence shows that in spite of days where she says it ‘ just does n’t feel real ’ , there have been some more light - hearted moments in her life of late			2
@entity23 attended her school ’s homecoming dance in an embellished pink dress , and posted pictures of herself kissing her new boyfriend that she started dating a month ago			2
those moments of teenage milestones hide the apparent pain that she continues to go through , she says that she regularly breaks down in the evenings and uses her happiness during the day as a way to project a better image			2
