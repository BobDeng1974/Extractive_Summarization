by @entity0 published : 10:59 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 15:10 est , 26 july 2013 archaeologists looking for @entity3 remains have stumbled across an even more historic find - a wooden railway which was instrumental in the development of the @entity6			1
an excavation on the banks of the @entity9 unearthed a stretch of waggonway which is more than 200 years old , making it the earliest surviving example of the standard - gauge railway			1
the discovery was originally part of a network which linked the ports of the @entity18 with collieries in @entity20 and @entity21 in the late 18th century			1
discovery : a wooden railway which carried waggons from collieries to the @entity9 has been unearthed archaeology : the excavation was expected to find @entity3 remains but instead stumbled upon the railway the railway was found by archaeologists digging on the site of the @entity31 shipyard , which is currently being redeveloped			1
because the site is near the @entity3 fort of @entity34 , in @entity35 , lead excavators @entity36 and @entity38 were expecting to find remains from the @entity3 period			1
instead , they stumbled across the 25 - metre stretch of wooden rails , an early contributor to the mining industry which transformed the @entity18			1
the waggonway is made up of a heavy duty ' main way ' with two sets of rails laid on top of each other to preserve their longevity , with a loop from the main line descending into a dip			1
that depression would have been filled with water where coal wagons ' wooden rails were rested to stop them drying out and cracking			1
in the middle of the loop is a stone elevation where the horse pulling the waggon would have stood			2
pioneering : the waggonways helped the @entity18 develop and were the precursor to @entity69 's train network breakthrough : standard - gauge railways ended up being used for steam trains around the world a waggonway from the former mining town of @entity76 in @entity77 ' the wooden waggonway uncovered by the excavation is the direct ancestor of the modern standard - gauge railway , ' mr @entity36 said			1
with horses and carts eventually replaced by steam trains , railways quickly became the fastest form of transportation the world had ever seen and facilitated the creation of the modern world			2
in @entity92 and the surrounding areas , the railways allowed coal to be transported around @entity69 , leading to the rapid growth of the region			0
mr @entity36 added : ' the coal industry was so vitally important for the @entity18 , and there are so few signs of it left now			0
' the archaeologists ' find is remarkably well - preserved - mr @entity38 said : ' it looks as if it has just been covered up and left yesterday			1
' the discovery has revealed features which were previously known only from drawings and the notebooks of engineers such as @entity110 , who lived near the dig site			0
work : the dig on the former site of the @entity31 shipyard comes as it is redeveloped for new construction preserved : the wooden rails have not rotted because they have been kept from biodegrading under the ground ' we have drawings describing what has been found by the dig but this is the real thing , ' said local historian @entity124			1
' it is tremendous to be able to see these features rather than just looking at them in historic drawings and notebooks			0
' because the line is standard railway gauge , it is tremendously important as the earliest example in the world and this is of international significance			0
the waggonway complex is at the forefront of late 18th - century engineering			1
' mr @entity124 , who has written a book on waggonways , claimed that the discovery was more important than any @entity3 find could be			1
' one of the gifts of the @entity18 to world history is the development of the railways , ' he said			0
' @entity148 and the railways are @entity20 's heritage and this waggonway was part of that , because without the waggonways the coalfields would not have developed			2
' in the late 18th century , hundreds of waggons ran from collieries to wharves on the @entity9 , where coal would be loaded onto brigs for transport to @entity162 and abroad			1
the excavated remains were part of the @entity165 , which took in collieries at @entity166 and @entity167 on the edge of @entity35			1
in 1801 the @entity169 , for which @entity171 's first locomotives were built , joined the @entity173 line			0
@entity171 and his son @entity174 went on to build locomotives at their works in @entity177 in @entity92 to the @entity173 gauge , which was 4ft 8½in wide - this became the standard width for railways throughout @entity69 and much of the world			0
a waggonway was a timber track used for transporting coal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries			2
they were an ingenious solution to a problem facing coal barons in @entity21 and @entity190 - namely , how to efficiently get coal from pit - head to port			0
the alternative , slower , option was via pack - horse or ox cart			0
a waggonway was a timber track used for transporting coal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries where possible , the waggonway would slope gently downhill so that the waggons could roll under their own weight			2
the driver sitting on the back would control the brake while the horse trotted behind on a tether			0
after the contents were emptied , the horse would pull the empty cart back up the slope			0
the rails on the @entity215 were made of wood , four or five inches thick and five or six inches broad			0
although the use of wood as a travelling surface was not new - @entity221 man had used it for carrying trackways across bogs - it was the use of the flanged wheel , which made all the difference , allowing the wagon to move snugly on the track			0
by 1810 , the wooden waggonways began to be phased out , replaced by iron			2
over the years , the wooden networks fell into disrepair			2
in 2000 , @entity233 successfully bid for £ 2million worth of funding to transform more than 30 miles of routes as part of the government 's @entity237			0
the former haulage routes were made into a welcoming and accessible community leisure , travel and learning resource .			0

archaeologists expected to find @entity3 remains under former shipyard
instead they unearthed wooden waggonway running from collieries to @entity9
@entity252 provided *prototype* for train network in @entity6
