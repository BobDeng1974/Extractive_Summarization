the year ’s first @entity0 sees @entity1 with a new kit , a new personal logo , a slimmed - down support team , pain - free and engaged to be married			1
and , as he insisted during a break in preparation for the @entity7 , which starts on monday , he also feels unencumbered by a surrounding atmosphere he felt may have held him back in 2014			1
it was an unusual sight to see him practising without @entity11 , who — along with trainer @entity12 — departed in the off - season , the former to work with @entity15			1
@entity1 ( left ) recently parted ways with trainer @entity12 ( right ) @entity1 also split with another of his coaching staff in @entity11 ( right ) @entity1 said he had different ideas on how to progress compared to @entity12 and @entity11 they had been through a lot and achieved much together , but it is becoming clear how much their harmony had deteriorated in the wake of @entity26 leaving and being replaced by @entity27			1
@entity1 referred to ‘ moving together in one direction ’ so often that it sounded like the topic might have been boy bands rather than the split from two of his most trusted lieutenants			1
‘ when i sat down with @entity11 and @entity12 at the end of the year it was clear they had different views on things and what they wanted to do , ’ said @entity1 , who meets a qualifier in the first round			1
‘ i did n’t really agree with them and that ’s why things ended up changing			2
‘ when you ’re actually playing tournaments you ’re not discussing every little thing , but when you look back at the year and the last few months i would say the atmosphere within the team was n’t particularly good			1
‘ it ’s not helpful for anyone when it ’s like that and that had n’t always been the case , we had a very good relationship for most of the time			2
when things are n’t going well and you look back and the atmosphere has n’t been good , it affects how everybody works			2
‘ the atmosphere is good now			2
when the people around you are pulling in the same direction it ’s beneficial and hopefully that will mean some good performances			2
’ it is clear that , aside from the passage of time — which can fray any good coaching relationship — one of the areas of disagreement involved training methods			2
@entity1 and @entity75 , the trainer now working full - time with him , have been focusing more on speed and slightly less on the hard yards in the gym			1
@entity1 ( left ) pictured in training ahead of the @entity7 as coach @entity27 ( right ) watches on @entity1 feels that he is in good shape going into the first major championship of the year he already feels it is paying a dividend and performances in his first two , albeit unofficial , tournaments of the year have banished the memory of that 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 loss to @entity88 at the @entity89 in november			1
‘ i have never moved as well at the beginning of a year , ’ he said			2
‘ coming into the @entity7 last year i did loads of fitness , too much , probably			1
i trained almost every day for three months and you could say i was very fit but i was tired as well			0
‘ when i was playing matches i was waking up sore and stiff so i was n’t necessarily match fit , whereas now i feel in good match shape			0
my first match of the year was long but i woke up with no issues			0
i feel strong and balanced			0
i have been doing a lot more speed work on the court			0
i have been working a lot on my movement in the off - season — three , four days a week			1
that is n’t something i have done much of over the last few years			0
‘ i feel that my speed around the court is a huge strength and something i should work on and try to get better at , because when i move well around the court , even when i am not playing good tennis , i can still find ways to win matches			2
’ he is also clearly of a mind to prove wrong those who question whether @entity27 is the right person to restore him to the status of @entity0 winner			1
murrayhits a return during a training session as he prepares for the @entity7 @entity1 unveiled his own logo this week and it will be launched at the @entity7 in 2015 @entity1 says he will leave the wedding planning to fiancee @entity120			1
a word of warning — when engaged to @entity124 , former world no 1 @entity123 declared : ‘ i ’ll just rock up			0
’ nine months later the pair split amid rumours of a dispute over the organising of their big day			0
‘ you ca n’t judge how a relationship is working with someone based on a few events , you have to look over an extended period of time , ’ he said			0
‘ in the off - season it has been the first time i have got to spend a good amount of time on the court with her to consistently work on things			1
’ the sense is that he is excited about his prospects , in contrast to 12 months ago when he was nervous about how his back would hold up following surgery			0
there is also the anticipation of his nuptials later this year , although he is leaving much of the arranging to fiancee @entity120 , saying : ‘ i try to stay out of all that			0
i just agree with @entity120 on most things			0
the only thing i will be involved in is the food — that is what i am particularly interested in			0
the rest is on @entity120			0
’ @entity1 ( left ) is engaged to @entity120 ( right ) but is letting her plan the wedding yesterday ’s draw has kept him in the opposite half to strong favourite @entity162 but there could be a fourth - round meeting with world no 11 @entity166 , who knocked him out of the @entity169 quarter - finals last year			1
and in the last eight @entity1 is due to meet @entity88 , so there is plenty of scope for avenging some of the disappointments of 2014			1
@entity174 will face world no 33 @entity175 while @entity176 , who overnight was attempting to win her second @entity178 title at the @entity179 , is up against world no 67 @entity180			0
@entity182 @entity181 and @entity183 were involved in the last round of qualifying .			0
