at the @entity2 ’s annual ceremony in april 2013 , sir @entity0 was invited on to the stage with the @entity4 to collect a special merit award			0
with a room full of several hundred people slapping him on the back as he made his way up to the receive the award , it would have been very easy for him to take all the glory			0
instead , as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 looked on , @entity0 spoke about the men who really did discover the group of players who trialled each night at @entity20 in @entity21 in the late @entity22			0
@entity23 earned rave reviews for his performance against @entity26 at the weekend and the man who brought him to @entity29 's attention - @entity28 - deserves huge praise for his discovery sir @entity0 recognised the work of @entity33 ( left ) , who brought through the class of 92 , when the then - @entity37 manager and his youth coach received merit awards at the @entity2 bash in 2013 ‘ we decided to invest in youth and @entity33 was a master , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ everyone worked so hard			0
‘ i brought in @entity44 , we coached , we trialled every night every week , and the trialling was producing unbelievable players			0
’ it was one of those nights when most people in the room were simply happy to be in the company of the @entity37 manager			0
he could easily have edited the story			0
instead , his speech was humble and well - meaning as he referenced the men who helped to make it all happen for @entity37			0
credit , where credit is due , and good on him for that			0
the modern trend is very different , with the scouts and development coaches who signed , recommended or brought through some of these young players scandalously overlooked in the final analysis			0
@entity23 put in an ' amazing ' shift against the @entity26 , according to @entity70 and @entity71 @entity72 blazed a trail for young players at @entity29 under @entity76 ' management @entity28 is one of hundreds of scouts who hammer it up and down motorways each week to act on tip - offs to watch young players			1
this guy should be chair - lifted into @entity83 at every home game and given the best seat in the house for the discovery of @entity23 and @entity88			1
@entity28 flagged both to @entity29 when he arrived at the club shortly after the appointment of @entity92 as technical director in 2010			1
@entity94 , another former @entity29 scout also played a significant role in the recruitment of @entity97 from @entity98 , along with @entity99 , who is scoring goals for fun in the development league , from @entity103			2
@entity23 was first spotted by @entity28 when he worked in the south of @entity105 , where he was employed as chief scout for the former @entity108 manager @entity107			1
a few years later , when @entity92 took @entity28 to @entity29 as one of his primary scouts , they made their move because the club had moved towards a different recruitment strategy under @entity115			1
@entity23 , who arrived at @entity83 from @entity116 in 2011 , was handed his debut by @entity76 at the end of the 2012 - 13 season and is pictured here starring in the @entity120 against @entity121 in 2012 @entity122 joined @entity29 's academy from @entity108 in 2010 and was just 17 when pictured celebrating a goal against @entity125 in the @entity126 at @entity83 the following year @entity92 was the man responsible for taking talent - spotter @entity28 to @entity29 @entity29 offered @entity116 £ 750,000 for @entity23 ; @entity127 offered £ 75,000 , or thereabouts			1
@entity23 is attracting a lot of attention at the moment , particularly after another eye - catching performance for @entity29 during their 2 - 0 victory at @entity26 on sunday			1
@entity135 columnist @entity70 and former @entity136 striker @entity71 reflected on his ‘ amazing performance ' during their analysis for @entity140 on sunday			0
@entity23 made his debut in may 2013 , picked by @entity76 for a 1 - 0 victory over @entity108 at @entity83 before he went on loan to @entity143 and @entity144			1
in nine appearances he has never lost in a @entity29 shirt			2
no - one deserves more credit than the player himself for his development , but others have played their part in his progress			0
sometimes they deserve a pat on the back , too			0
@entity157 was short of numbers for a six - a - side game at @entity160 when he fetched @entity23 over to play with the senior players for the first time in 2012			2
@entity23 showed no anxiety , announcing himself to a group of players that included @entity166 by scoring in the top corner , first with his left foot and then with his right			2
when @entity166 asked how old he was , the @entity170 forward refused to believe that @entity23 was only 16			2
‘ at least 18 , ’ was @entity166 ’s response			0
nobody knew too much about this kid from the @entity29 academy and nobody was quite sure where he had come from			2
@entity23 impressed former @entity29 striker @entity166 when he trained with him at @entity160 for the first time @entity23 helped @entity143 avoid relegation on the final day of last season during his loan spell at @entity180 's the youngster also had a successful spell at @entity144 before @entity76 recalled him last month in the mists of time , along with the constant shuffling and sacking of staff ( @entity28 was fired by @entity29 in november 2014 ) , it is easy to forget the men who made it all possible			1
@entity191 , who was the club ’s academy director , and @entity92 have left @entity83			1
stuff happens , people fall out of favour , they may well accept that			0
their legacy , though , is hugely talented , young @entity105 players , who are being given the opportunity to thrive under @entity76			0
@entity23 has forced his way into the first team after returning from a successful loan spell at @entity206			2
@entity23 , in derby action against @entity208 , has played nine times for @entity29 's first team and has never lost the huge turnover of staff at the top @entity214 clubs means that it would very easy to forget @entity23 ’s journey from @entity216 , where he made a handful of appearances , to first - team player at @entity29			1
‘ you do n’t want to miss out on a 17 - year - old at @entity223 , so you go to watch , ’ admitted @entity28 in a recent interview			2
‘ you have to go to games , you have to go with your gut instincts			1
’ when it comes to his work at @entity29 , guys like @entity28 deserve a special merit award			1
@entity88 , playing in an under 18 match against @entity127 last year , is tipped for a bright future at @entity29 the 17 - year - old is gaining first - team experience on loan in the championship with @entity236			1

@entity23 has played nine times for the @entity242 first team and never lost
