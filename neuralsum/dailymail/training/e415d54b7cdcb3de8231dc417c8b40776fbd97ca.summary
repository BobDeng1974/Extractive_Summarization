by @entity0 @entity1 had just broken over the squalid , stinking campsite that had been the young @entity5 ’s home by the dockside in @entity7 for the last three months			2
when 20 - year - old @entity9 looked out of his makeshift tent there was a @entity12 policeman in riot gear telling him to get up and go			1
‘ where ? ’ he asked the officer as he watched the site being dismantled and destroyed all around him			2
‘ go to @entity17 , ’ the policeman told him			2
’ desperate : migrants push against a steel barrier as their camp in @entity7 disappears before their eyes			2
not one said the action would alter their hopes of getting to @entity17 to start a new life that was how the @entity12 authorities yesterday thought they could solve the long - standing problem of migrants using the port as a waiting room for a new life in @entity17			1
but today – within hours of the campsite being cleared – the daily struggle by refugees and chancers trying to smuggle themselves aboard a lorry or cling to a @entity41 train was set to start again			1
yet , even in the long and difficult history of @entity7 as a stepping stone towards the @entity44 , yesterday was dramatically different			1
everywhere the would - be @entity17 looked when they emerged into the daylight , they saw police vans , gendarmes and officers in full riot gear			1
somewhere in the distance , a brace of bulldozers was waiting to move in and flatten everything to the ground			2
and so , in a carefully planned operation to rid the @entity12 port of this eyesore and its unwanted controversy and in a fierce confrontation with those demanding human rights for the migrants , another chapter in a years - old saga came to a close			1
if only it was the finale			2
but even as mechanical diggers were crushing tents and turning three campsites back into swathes of empty wasteland , anyone you spoke to would tell you it wo n’t end here			1
‘ not until i get to @entity76 or die trying , ’ as one put it yesterday			1
nor is it likely to halt an immigration @entity81 which arrest , deportation , beatings and appalling conditions have repeatedly failed to stop			2
one charity worker said @entity7 ‘ will always be a magnet of hope ’ for the thousands who see it as the last stop before @entity17			2
face off : a migrant confronts a row of grim - faced @entity12 riot officers in body armour as his possessions are cleared last night that determination was underlined by little clutches of people , cold and homeless , but far from hopeless , wandering the streets , sitting in doorways , sleeping under bushes – and waiting for the next chance to try			1
it took months to turn this camp into somewhere that up to 1,000 migrants colonised ; less than two hours to destroy it			2
authorities insisted it had to be cleared because of an outbreak of scabies , a skin condition caused by mites ( although none of the migrants i spoke to yesterday knew anyone who had been infected )			1
scuffles broke out as armed police used shields and batons to corral and drive back scores of migrants whose base was being flattened before their eyes , often with their possessions still inside their tents			1
a few hundred yards away , a @entity128 ferry was loading lorries and other vehicles before setting sail for @entity76			0
everyone knew there would be another one soon			1
time to move : a gendarme peers into one of the makeshift shelters used by migrants in the @entity7 camp @entity139 , a 25 - year - old student , sat on a grass bank with some companions as the diggers moved in			1
he told me he was kidnapped by @entity145 supporters from his home in @entity147 , had a hood put over his head and was threatened with his life			0
he abandoned his dream of studying to become a zoologist and fled			0
he and his family paid 10,000 @entity154 dollars to a fixer to get him to @entity156 , then through @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity12			1
he has been in @entity7 for the past four months , despite being deported twice to @entity159 , the country that holds his fingerprints			0
each time he has returned ; next stop @entity161			0
‘ i will get there , ’ he tells me , pointing out to sea with the only remnant of his former home – a glass - fibre tent pole			0
in a daily routine that spans morning , noon and night , he calculates he has tried more than 400 times to get to @entity17			0
with a smile , he adds : ‘ one day , i know that i will succeed			0
’ nearby young @entity9 ( his name means ‘ wish ’ ) was describing the ‘ very frightening ’ moment he was woken and beaten by a police officer ordering him to get out of his tent			1
the student , who says his family was murdered , left the camp with nothing but his clothes when the police moved in			1
levelled : a digger ploughs into shelters , crushing them and the possessions occupants could n't save another @entity5 , probably in his 30s , complained : ‘ no one explained what was happening			1
we were just told to move			0
now we have nowhere to stay , nowhere to sleep			0
‘ but we still have our human rights			0
here , they give you nothing			0
in @entity17 , they give you a house , somewhere to sleep			0
that is where i will go			0
’ yesterday charity and support groups – as well as activists demanding fair treatment for the migrants – brought food and water and handed out numbered tickets to exchange for blankets			1
about 300 were moved to an open - air compound for the night as volunteers prepared meals for them			0
one stood talking in @entity12 among a group of maybe 100 displaced ex-campsite dwellers and told me : ‘ they are prepared to risk their lives to get to @entity76 and they ’re not going to give up			1
‘ they do n’t want to stay in @entity12			1
they can not go home			0
so yes , they will be back			0
if not here , then somewhere else in @entity7			0
‘ it is a cycle , a continuing cycle			0
it is their gateway to the @entity17			0
the authorities ? they can close the gate , but people will still find a way			2
