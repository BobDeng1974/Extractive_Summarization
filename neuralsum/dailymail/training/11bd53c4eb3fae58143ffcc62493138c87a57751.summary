by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 06:41 est , 22 january 2013 the last minute dash to secure tickets to one of @entity5 's biggest sporting tournaments has begun after the two teams to play in this year 's @entity7 have been revealed			1
fans of the @entity9 and @entity10 who had n't already purchased tickets are now doing all they can to try and secure passes to see their teams in action			2
and with just two weeks to go before the big game , a single ticket is selling for an average $ 3,000			2
winning moment : @entity9 celebrate after their 28 - 24 win against the @entity20 in the @entity21 on sunday , which will see them compete in the @entity7 final the finalists : @entity10 players cheer after beating the @entity25 in @entity26 to advance to @entity27 the prices have shot up from around $ 2,000 on sunday morning , just a few hours before the final playoff games determined who would be going head to head in @entity7 2013			1
director of data and communications at ticket website @entity36 , @entity38 , told @entity39 the match will be a ' golden game ' for ticket sales for two reasons			0
one is that the two teams are coached by two brothers - @entity46 with the 49ers and his brother @entity48 with the @entity10 - has added an extra twist to this @entity7			1
second , is that the 49ers - who have n't won a @entity7 since 1995 - has a large fan base in @entity52 who may be happy to travel to @entity54 to see their team 's triumphant return			0
some brotherly competition : @entity10 head coach @entity48 , left , and @entity9 head coach @entity46 , right , will see their teams go head - to - head in the @entity7 long time coming : the @entity9 last played in the @entity7 against the @entity61 back in 1995 , pictured above mr @entity38 told @entity39 : ' at the end of the day , marketers and ticket sellers are hoping for a good game and praying for the right teams			1
' the official list prices for the @entity7 â€™s upper bowl , lower bowl and club seats are $ 850 , $ 950 and $ 1,250 respectively for 2013			0
but any fan hoping to get their hands on a ticket now , will pay a minimum of $ 1,700 , according to prices listed on @entity36			0
and if last year 's prices are anything to go by , with an average ticket selling for $ 10,000 , then the cost is going to just keep soaring until kick - off on february 3			0
big event : tickets to see last year 's @entity7 where the @entity84 beat the @entity25 , pictured , were more than $ 10,000 each as the game approached			2
