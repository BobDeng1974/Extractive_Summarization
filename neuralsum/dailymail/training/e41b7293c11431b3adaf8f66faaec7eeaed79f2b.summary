by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 has warned a @entity4 broadcaster may not be able to afford all of the @entity6 's shows @entity4 viewers could lose access to many @entity6 programmes if they decide to leave the @entity12 in next month ’s referendum , its former director general warned yesterday			1
refuting first minister @entity14 , who has promised @entity4 they would keep programmes such as @entity16 and @entity17 , @entity2 said a @entity4 broadcaster would not be able to afford all of the @entity6 ’s shows			1
@entity2 , who ran the corporation from 1992 to 2000 , also warned that the @entity6 would also suffer under independence , losing a quarter of its funding			1
writing in the @entity22 , he became the latest high profile figure to come out in favour of the no campaign ahead of the vote on september 18			1
he said some of @entity14 ’s claims were ‘ make believe ’ , adding : ‘ one reason for @entity12 ’s exceptional creative and intellectual vitality is our genius for founding institutions that channel and foster our national talent			0
none of these bodies is more effective than the @entity6			0
’ @entity2 said a new @entity4 publicly funded broadcaster , the @entity38 , would have just ten per cent of the @entity6 ’s current budget and would have to ‘ tailor its programmes and services to its modest means			1
’ he said : ‘ like other broadcasters , i expect the @entity38 will want to acquire programmes from the @entity6 , not least those loved by @entity4 audiences			2
the @entity6 is , thankfully , independent of government so whatever is asserted wishfully in the [ yes campaign ’s ] white paper , the @entity6 will have no alternative but to act in the interests of its licence payers and to seek the best possible commercial terms for the sale of its programmes in @entity4 , not least because of the financial impoverishment it will just have suffered			2
‘ and , of course , there may be commercial broadcasters in a new @entity4 willing to pay more for the @entity6 ’s most successful programmes than an impecunious @entity38 … one way or another , after independence , @entity4 viewers would have to pay to receive @entity6 services			0
‘ those who will vote for independence identify and expect many gains			0
but many of the advantages that the most creative and inspiring talents in @entity4 have enjoyed for 300 years – of making a massive impact on a big stage to global acclaim – will be lost			0
’ @entity2 said that the @entity6 would immediately lose ten per cent of its income if @entity4 became independent			1
the show may be out of reach of any @entity4 public broadcaster 's budget should the country become independent but he said the amount it spends on tv and radio would decrease by another 15 per cent because a greater share of the licence fee would be needed to pay for other services such as the @entity93			1
he warned : ‘ in the space of just a few years , if @entity4 became independent the @entity6 as we know it would effectively lose a quarter of its funding			1
fundamental changes to @entity6 services would be unavoidable			0
’ in february , the former culture secretary @entity100 warned @entity4 would lose automatic access to the @entity6 if it became independent			2
in november , the @entity102 published a @entity103 that promised a new ‘ @entity106 ’ , using the @entity6 ’s assets in @entity4 , would continue to air @entity6 programmes			0
it said viewers would benefit from similar deals to those in force in the @entity111 , where many @entity6 shows are screened on local channels			2
the @entity103 said : ‘ this will ensure that the people of @entity4 will still have access to all current programming , including @entity118 , @entity17 and @entity16 , and to chan - nels like @entity120			0
’ mr @entity14 said a @entity4 public service broadcaster would be ‘ based on the existing staff and assets of @entity124 ’ .			0
