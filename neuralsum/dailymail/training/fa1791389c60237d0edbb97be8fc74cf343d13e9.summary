by @entity0 turn up at the doctor ’s with a sore throat and you ’ll probably be told it ’s just a viral infection so antibiotics wo n’t help , and the best thing is to go home and rest			1
i know , because i ’ve suffered with a sore throat for as long as i can remember — every day			2
but it was only last year that the real , and potentially serious , cause was diagnosed			2
it has nothing to do with viral infections , yet millions who suffer from pain or a ‘ lump ’ in their throat still believe them to be signs of cold or flu and do n’t seek medical help			1
@entity0 , pictured here , suffers from @entity26 , which leaves her with a constantly sore throat that she has had ' since she can remember ' in fact , like me , they could have gastroesophageal reflux disease ( @entity26 ) , which causes stomach acid to spill up into the oesophagus or gullet			1
this has been quietly damaging my throat , as the acid — as strong and corrosive as battery acid — inflames , attacks and erodes the gullet ’s lining			1
long term , the risk is that the acid changes the cells lining the gullet , and this in turn can lead to cancer			1
the root cause of @entity26 is usually a weakness of the valve between the stomach and gullet , though some people are simply sensitive to reflux			1
it can run in families but can also affect anybody , as my diagnosis shows : i am a slim , non-smoking , non-drinking , healthy - eating , thirtysomething female			2
so common is the condition — better known as acid reflux — that one in five @entity62 suffer from it at least once a week , and one in 10 daily			1
many people have what is called silent reflux — meaning they have none of the typical symptoms of heartburn			1
instead they may have other symptoms connected to the acid reflux			1
‘ around one in 10 have a sore throat			2
for others the first sign is rotting teeth as the acid is eroding them , or asthma			1
about 10 per cent of adult asthma is due to reflux , as people inhale little bits of acid , irritating the airways , ’ says @entity71 , a consultant specialist upper - gastrointestinal surgeon at @entity73 and queen @entity74 , @entity76 consequently , doctors often miss the signs			1
dr @entity92 , a consultant gastroenterologist at the @entity93 , says his colleagues in the ear , nose and throat unit often call him in to see ‘ respiratory ’ patients who actually have acid reflux			1
other common symptoms include heartburn , burping , a bitter taste and regurgitation			2
many people have what is called silent reflux ¿ meaning they have none of the typical symptoms of heartburn			1
the root cause of @entity26 is usually a weakness of the valve between the stomach and gullet , though some people are simply sensitive to @entity117 common is the condition ¿ better known as acid reflux ¿ that one in five @entity62 suffer from it at least once a week , and one in 10 daily like many people , i had none of these except a sore throat			1
i first sought treatment in 2009 , following a tonsillectomy that solved my recurrent tonsillitis but not my chronic throat pain			2
when it was most sore — a sharp , constant pain , and red , raw appearance lasting several days — i returned to my doctor , who diagnosed pharyngitis ( an infection of the throat ) and prescribed antibiotics			2
this happened many times over the next few years , although i generally ignored the low - level discomfort and self - medicated with lozenges , ice lollies and vitamins			2
i noticed my throat was most sore when i was tired , hungover or had been up late , so decided it was due to being run - down or alcohol lowering my immune system			2
so i stopped drinking , curtailed my late nights , and my throat improved , though after an occasional wedding or hen party i ’d always end up with what my doctor diagnosed as an infection			0
the correct diagnosis came by accident last year			0
i happened to see a locum , who asked if i had a sore throat , as i had a vitamin d deficiency			0
when i said that i always had a sore throat , she insisted i see a throat specialist and referred me			0
i arrived at the hospital two months later , unable to imagine anyone resolving my sore throat given that i ’d already had a tonsillectomy and been on and off antibiotics for years			0
the doctor put a camera up my nose and down my throat , then diagnosed @entity26 ; the pain and visible inflammation in my throat was due to acid damage			1
i was stunned and protested i ’d never had heartburn or indigestion in my life , visualising tv adverts for antacid tablets easing a portly man ’s chest - pain after dinner			0
but the doctor explained you do n’t necessarily feel heartburn — in fact a sore throat or ‘ lump in the throat ’ is a common symptom			0
people may also cough or clear their throat constantly , as phlegm is produced to try and counteract the damage			0
i was still unpersuaded , so the doctor handed me a list of the main lifestyle culprits			0
it was basically a list of my favourite treats : tea ( i have eight cups a day ) ; dairy ( i drink two pints of milk daily ) ; chocolate ( at least one bar a day ) ; and eating or drinking late at night			0
‘ to deal with fat in foods like chocolate and dairy , the body delays stomach emptying in order to emulsify the fat in warm acid , ’ says mr @entity71			1
‘ that means acid does n’t clear out the bottom and starts sloshing up the top end			1
’ could @entity0 's love of dairy , chocolate , tea ( left ) and wine ( right ) have contributed to her painful throat condition ? tea , coffee , peppermint and caffeine trigger reflux as they relax the valve , while alcohol and smoking trigger acid release in the stomach lining , meaning you secrete more acid			1
acidic foods like fruit juice exacerbate the issue			0
once i ’d accepted the diagnosis , i was ecstatic			0
suddenly things clicked into place , like why my throat was worse after nights out			0
not only is alcohol very acid - producing but i always ate tea and toast before bed to ward off hangovers , so was digesting food horizontally , when gravity is not helping acid remain in the stomach			1
to prevent acid reflux you should not eat or drink within three hours of bedtime			1
i was n’t run - down or fighting off an infection after all ; i ’d simply irritated my throat by my behaviour			0
it was a revelation to recognise other symptoms too , such as the ‘ lump ’ in my throat — swelling from the inflammation — and my persistent earache , which had developed in the last year			0
i was told that nerves that run from the gullet to the brain have an obscure connection to the ear canal			0
i also speak so quietly that people struggle to hear me			0
‘ acid reflux can cause a hoarse voice as it inflames the vocal cords , ’ explains mr @entity71			1
my doctor prescribed omeprazole tablets , twice daily for six months , which she claimed would cure my reflux			2
@entity271 is a form of proton pump inhibitor ( @entity274 ) , a prescription drug that reduces acid production in the stomach ; over-the - counter remedies such as @entity279 and @entity280 neutralise the acid coming up			2
my first spell on the pills lasted three weeks , until i became convinced they were making me gain weight			0
i started the tablets again last autumn when the pain worsened			0
but at night the room spun so severely i had to sit up all night — vertigo is a side - effect for around one per cent of the drug ’s users , so i stopped taking it			0
however , i recently restarted the tablets , in the morning , resolving the vertigo , as i discovered how serious acid reflux can be			1
the first my friend heard of his own acid reflux was when he was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer			1
he has survived , but has lost much of his stomach and still has major surgery			0
of course , not everyone who has acid reflux gets cancer			1
but 10 to 15 cent of people with @entity26 develop a pre-cancerous change in their oesophageal lining , a condition called @entity310 ’s oesophagus			1
and one in every 200 patients with @entity310 ’s oesophagus will develop cancer			0
though the numbers are small , the longer you have acid reflux , the greater the danger , and i could have it for decades			1
‘ over time the condition can cause scarring of the gullet , which leads to a narrowing so you ca n’t swallow			0
occasionally it leads to the lining becoming cancerous , so we ’re very active in treating young people , ’ says mr @entity71			0
‘ @entity326 pump inhibitors work for 90 per cent of people and take the sting away , but acid is still going up into the gullet and injuring it ; surgery will reduce the risk of cancer much more			2
’ a private consultant has told me that , to find my best treatment options , i need a gastroscopy — where a camera will be inserted into my oesophagus to investigate the state of my stomach valve			0
if it is n’t working , i may require surgery — either traditional internal ‘ origami ’ to fold the stomach around the weak valve to stop acid splashing up , or the new @entity347 bracelet , where a ring of tiny magnets is placed around the bottom of the gullet , allowing food through but stopping acid rising up			2
in the meantime , as well as omeprazole , i take antacids when the pain intensifies			0
i also intend to change my diet as i ’ve heard it can make a radical difference - but i ’m a tea and chocolate addict			0
if i was n’t , i might never have felt the reflux in the first place .			2
