the @entity11 and @entity46 ( @entity10 ) fought alongside their @entity48 , @entity49 and other allies at @entity21 in @entity3 during @entity16			1
the background to the @entity21 landings was one of deadlock on the @entity42 in 1915 , when the @entity48 hoped to capture @entity52			0
the @entity53 were under threat from the @entity3 in the @entity55 and needed help , so the @entity48 decided to bombard and try to capture @entity21			1

today marks the 98th anniversary of the @entity21 landings general sir @entity63 ( left ) who led the @entity21 campaign , and @entity48 commander sir @entity65 ( right ) , who was also involved on their way : @entity11 soldiers embarking at @entity69 to fight in @entity16 in december 1914			2

the intention of this was to then knock @entity3 out of the war			2
a naval attack began on february 19 but it was called off after three battleships were sunk			0
then by the time of another landing on april 25 , the @entity3 had been given time to prepare better fortifications and increased their armies sixfold			2
@entity11 and @entity12 troops won a bridgehead at @entity2 as the @entity48 aimed to land at five points in @entity105 - but only managed three			1
the @entity48 still required reinforcements in these areas and the @entity3 were able to bring extra troops onto the peninsula to better defend themselves			2
a standstill continued through the summer in hot and filthy conditions , and the campaign was eventually ended by the @entity113 in winter 1915			0
the invasion had been intended to knock @entity3 out of the war , but in the end it only gave the @entity53 some breathing space from the @entity3			1
@entity3 lost around 300,000 men and the @entity37 had 214,000 killed - more than 8,000 of whom were @entity11 soldiers , in a disastrous campaign			1
@entity2 became a focus for @entity11 pride after forces were stuck there in squalid conditions for eight months , defending the area from the @entity3			1
the @entity10 soldiers who arrived on the narrow strip of beach were faced with a difficult environment of steep cliffs and ridges - and almost daily shelling			0
gathering : crowds of people look on after the annual @entity10 march at the @entity137 in @entity69 streets : dozens of participants took to the street in the annual parade in the most populous city in @entity11 in silence : people pay their respects at the @entity89 during the @entity147 at the @entity148 today in @entity149 , @entity11 stories to tell : prime minister of australia @entity151 talks with former @entity152 at the @entity153 today in @entity154 , @entity11 memorial : a member of the catafalque party stands at rest during the @entity10 today in @entity154 , marked by veterans , dignitaries and members of the public at the height of the fighting during the landings of april 25 , 1915 , the waters around the peninsula were stained red with blood at one point 50 metres out			2
fierce resistance from the under - rated @entity171 forces , inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster for the campaign			0
among those who suffered the greatest losses were the @entity79 @entity11 and @entity46 who made the first landings , swept by an unexpected current to a narrow cove rather than the wide beaches the planners intended			2
war historian @entity184 wrote : ‘ that strongly marked and definite entity , the @entity10 tradition , had , from the first morning , been partly created here ’			0
but despite the toll in human life , the campaign is seen as a landmark in the formation of national consciousness in the two countries			0
the 25th of april was officially named @entity10 in 1916			0
and today tens of thousands of people across the world attended dawn services across the world as the centenary of @entity21 nears			0
