by @entity1 reporter the @entity3 's submarine bases are some of the most high - security installations in the world , but one of the most important is located at a lake in landlocked @entity7			1
the @entity3 's @entity8 ( @entity9 ) at @entity10 , @entity7 , has supported every major submarine design development of the last 65 years			1
although located some 375 miles from the ocean , it has been called â€˜ the @entity16 force 's most important body of water " by admiral @entity18 , who once headed the @entity3 's submarine warfare group			1
although located some 375 miles from the ocean , the @entity3 's @entity8 at @entity10 , @entity7 , has supported every major submarine design development of the last 65 years @entity9 is located on the banks of @entity22 , which provides the perfect conditions for testing new submarine advancements as conditions closely mimic the ocean , reports @entity27			1
at about 1150 feet , the lake is deeper than @entity29 , while its large size , clear water and quiet conditions - provided by steep tree - lined shores and a flat muddy bottom - mean it has been a key testing location for the @entity3 since @entity35			1
the lake also stays remarkably calm for its size and maintains a constant chilly temperature under 100 feet			0
much of the testing is done using a large network of extremely sensitive hydrophones placed in key locations on , or tethered to , the bottom of the lake			2
the @entity3 's @entity8 is located on the banks of @entity22 , which provides the perfect conditions for testing new submarine advancements as conditions closely mimic the ocean one of the buoyant vessels housed at @entity10 , @entity7 , used for testing new developments from the @entity3 the main testing area is called the @entity49 which is a 1,000 foot diameter circle of hydrophones mounted on the bottom of the lake or suspended via buoys			1
it is a controlled environment created to evaluate a vehicle 's signature and sensors			2
the @entity57 is used to measure the sound that the forward sections of a submarine design , mainly its bow , makes while moving through the water			2
it allows for better bow sonar acuity and quieter subs			0
the @entity66 is where 1/4 scale submarines , which usually closely resemble operational subs of both past and present , go out and run through their paces under their own power			0
@entity73 guard the world 's largest unmanned submarine , the 111 foot @entity77 2 @entity76 being housed at @entity78 this allows for a wide variety of items to be tested , such as a boat 's wake signature , new sail designs , propeller noise , new sub-scale propulsion concepts and propulsor configurations and a design 's active handling capabilities			1
there are two known large scale vehicles currently in service at @entity78			2
the @entity93 is a 1/4 scale model of the @entity95 of @entity97 subs			0
it is 90 feet long by ten feet wide and can travel at 3,000hp			0
the second , known as @entity100 , is the largest unmanned submarine in the world at 110 feet long			0
she was designed to be modular in nature and can travel at up to 6,000hp			0
over the years , @entity78 has helped save the @entity3 billions of dollars as they seek to develop more advanced submarines			1
the @entity66 is where 1/4 scale submarines , which usually closely resemble operational subs of both past and present , are put through their paces			0

the @entity3 's @entity8 at @entity10 , @entity7 , is located some 375 miles from the ocean on the banks of @entity22
it provides the perfect conditions for testing new submarine advancements as conditions closely mimic the ocean
@entity78 has supported every major submarine design development of the last 65 years and saved the @entity3 millions of dollars as a result
