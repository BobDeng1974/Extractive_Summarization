should a man pay for dinner while on a date with a woman ? as if the dating game was n't difficult enough , this issue has now become a minefield for men and women over the last few years			1
as females fight for equality on all terms , stars like @entity10 have encountered awkward situations at the end of a meal when they insist on paying their way			1
but others , like @entity20 's @entity19 say that a man should look after a woman - in her new blog for @entity25 , the singer explains why @entity10 's stance on male chivalry is wrong			1
@entity19 with her boyfriend @entity28 from the boy band 5ive @entity19 , who is currently dating @entity28 from the boy band 5ive , said : ' what is wrong with a man displaying good old fashioned ‘ chivalry ’ and feeling uncomfortable that she wants to pay ? ' this is not a weakness on either side , it ’s about letting a man be a considerate , generous , kind human being			1
why emasculate him ? it ’s unnecessary			0
' this just puts more pressure on women			2
' @entity19 goes on to point out that the pay gap between women and women is still huge in most of the western world , so through no fault of their own , females bring home much less money than their male counterparts			1
she said : ' i recently took part in the tv show @entity56 , which was a great success			0
' but the following year all the female acts got dropped from the tour and all the male acts had yet another opportunity to bring home the bacon			0
' actress @entity10 recently revealed that she tried to pay for the bill at the end of a date and it made the man feel very awkward @entity19 continued : ' there are so many expectations placed on women now			1
' if shows like @entity76 are anything to go by , its common place for lads to think they can “ bang ” as many “ birds ” as they want , like we ’re pieces of meat			0
' this is the cultural shift that is openly part of the youth today			0
' on top of this , now it ’s being suggested girls “ pick up their own tab ”			0
well , it just gets rosier for men does n’t it ? ' @entity19 ( left ) with her @entity20 band mates @entity95 ( centre ) and @entity97 ( right ) in 2003 in fact , @entity19 believes that in the @entity100 , it is crucial that men be taught to look after the fairer sex			1
she said : ' i personally think that men should look after women			2
that is not a weakness			0
' by allowing them to do that , it may create more empathy and stop some men viewing women as “ bangable ” pieces of meat			2
' i fully expect my three boys to be respectful , kind and generous to their future partners too			0
