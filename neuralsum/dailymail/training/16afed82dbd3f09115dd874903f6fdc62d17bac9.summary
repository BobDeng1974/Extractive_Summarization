oh , how celebrities love @entity1			2
they can pour out whatever drivel they please without interruption			2
but best of all , for them at least , they can get paid for their ‘ thoughts ’ on the social networking site			1
a sting on soap stars in @entity11 , which was revealed this week , has shown just how commercial celebrity tweets have become			1
actors from @entity14 were invited to a ‘ gifting event ’ at a @entity16 and then wrote glowing tweets about freebie goodies they ’d been given by a fake company called @entity20 ( amusingly , in @entity21 that means ‘ corporate whore ’ )			2
sponsored : actress @entity23 ( left ) and singer @entity24 ( right ) have both been seen to plug their sponsors on @entity1 they may have claimed they were tricked into writing the tweets , but the investigation has highlighted a growing grey area where celebrities are using @entity1 for their own gain			2
in the @entity37 , stars such as @entity35 — who has 18 million followers on @entity1 — can earn up to £ 7,000 for a single 140 - character tweet if she mentions a particular product			1
here , footballer @entity40 was rapped by the advertising watchdog the @entity41 for posting links written by his @entity44 sponsors			1
the @entity41 deemed the tweets to be more like adverts — but that does n’t appear to have stopped more recent tweets about @entity40 ’s new @entity44 golf club , for example			1
others are more subtle when it comes to their commercial tweets , whether it is a tv presenter talking about the wonderful designer clothes she has been given or the sports star who tweets about her new car , but fails to mention it came courtesy of her sponsor			2
what ’s becoming increasingly clear is that @entity1 — once a forum for celebrities to express their real feelings — is increasingly becoming a business			2
the biggest stars can earn up to £ 100,000 a year ( in ready cash or the equivalent in freebies ) simply for telling their followers their sponsored ‘ thoughts ’			1
here , the @entity74 looks at some of the worst offenders			2
@entity77 : @entity78 has been known to subtly mention @entity79 - without giving away the fact she is paid thousands by them each year for promotional work @entity78 engaged to @entity84 cricketer @entity83 , the self - styled ‘ mum , model , actress , bikini designer , organic farmer ’ is worth £ 7 million and has 300,000 followers			1
@entity91 : in between flirting with her fiancé via @entity1 and endless plugs about her bikini and bedding ranges , and acting work , @entity78 also finds time to subtly mention @entity79 — without giving away the fact she is paid thousands by them each year for promotional work			1
in may , she wrote ‘ salivating over my new @ @entity79 goodies ’ and a day later : ‘ and thank you @ @entity79 for the arsenal of lip goodies			2
’ @entity104 : 6/10 @entity105 the @entity106 turned fashion designer , 39 , has 6.3 million followers — and is worth a cool £ 40 million			1
@entity91 : there is a lot about her jet - setting and clothing line , and plenty about how handsome her husband is , but she still manages to fit in a few plugs for some of the many items she gets free or hugely discounted			2
these include @entity122 slippers : ‘ how cute are these ! ! ! ’ ; white designer shoes : ‘ obsessed with my new white @entity127 ’ ; more shoes : ‘ thank you @ @entity129 for my shoes ! ! ! how posh , they have my initials on ! ! ! ’ and there is other designer gear which is all pictured : ‘ nicest socks ever ! @entity135 ’ ; ‘ @entity137 candles ! ! ! super chic			2
’ and even stuff for her 23 - month - old fashion plate daughter ( and favourite accessory ) @entity143 : ‘ @entity145 cute jelly shoes for @entity143 from @entity146 @ @entity147			0
’ @entity148 : 9/10 stars : @entity35 ( left ) can earn up to £ 7,000 for a single 140 - character tweet if she mentions a particular product while @entity152 ( right ) has a serious amount of ' @entity154 ' who hang on his every word @entity35 the curvy 32 - year - old @entity37 reality star , aka ‘ the world ’s worst role model ’ , recently gave birth to a daughter called @entity161 ( yes , really )			1
she ’s reportedly worth £ 14 million and has 18 million @entity1 followers			1
@entity91 : there is a lot about the @entity165 ’ huge ‘ kollection ’ of wares ; just about anything from clothes to bronzing lotion			0
everyone , it seems , wants to get that @entity35 look and she is there to help you — by plugging the stuff she is given			1
if you want to be as sparkly as her , you could try ‘ necklace sparkling on my face # @entity186 , ’ ; if you want her decorative look , there is ‘ chic @ lampsplus lighting ’ ; or if you have sore lips ‘ @ @entity181 to the rescue ! ’ it goes on			0
@entity148 : 10/10 @entity189 - model : @entity190 tweets about companies who pay her - such as the chocolate bar @entity193 - or give her free stuff @entity152 the @entity197 singer is beloved by obsessed teenagers around the world — which is why 41 million follow the 19 - year - old on @entity1			1
@entity202 : @entity152 has a serious amount of ‘ @entity154 ’ who hang on his every word			0
a lot of his tweets are about his day - to - day activities as he tours the world			0
but there are several plugs for sponsor @entity212 , such as ‘ @entity213 today			0
making them make longer shirts ’			0
another was for his range of telephone cases made by @entity219 : ‘ u got one ? ’ he asks			0
he does n’t forget his tour sponsor : ‘ @entity222 to @ @entity224 cosmetics			0

@entity91 : @entity24 started the year with a resolution to get fit			1
‘ first training session this year done ! was hard but feel good ! going 2 stick 2 my resolution and fight the january blues @ @entity236 ’ did she need to tell us what gym it was ? surely it ’s not because she has a commercial interest , is it ? well , what do you know — she ’s the company ’s creative director			2
@entity24 ’s other big sponsor is @entity247 : ‘ well done @ @entity248 for reaching 50k followers			2
mwah ! ’ she tweeted			0
again no mention is made of the fact she is being paid by them			0
@entity148 : 7/10 tweets : @entity190 and @entity24 have both been seen plugging their sponsors @entity190 the 34 - year - old glamour model turned author , clothes designer , columnist and businesswoman says on @entity1 : ‘ never underestimate the @entity261 ! ’ she may have a point , given that she has a reported fortune of £ 45 million and 1.8 million @entity1 followers			1

@entity148 : 6/10 the 27 - year - old @entity319 and @entity320 footballer is worth £ 50 million and has 6.6 million followers on @entity1			1
@entity202 : @entity40 may have been censured by the advertising watchdog for his link to @entity44 , but that has not stopped him tweeting about the company — without mentioning his £ 1 million - a - year deal with them			1
recent examples include : ‘ the pitches change			0
the killer instinct does n’t			0
own the turf , anywhere @entity333 ’ and ‘ different rules , same philosophy : play your way ’ with another @entity44 link			1
