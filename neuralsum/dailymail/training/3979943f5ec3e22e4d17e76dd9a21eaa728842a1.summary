yes chef : @entity1 has warned rare steak could be off the menu in @entity5 restaurants due to over zealous councils the prospect of a rare steak could become even rarer in @entity5 restaurants , an influential @entity5 chef has warned			1
food guru and critic @entity1 blames local council officials for trying to enforce rules designed for factories and fast - food chains , which demand meat is cooked through , on small restaurants			1
she said : ‘ i can see a day when you have to go to @entity18 to get a rare steak			0
' the same for pink duck breasts , liver or kidneys			1
’ miss @entity1 , a judge on the @entity24 ’s hit cooking series ‘ @entity25 ’ , added : ‘ if you have a really good chef , or course he is going to be good about making sure he is not poisoning anybody			2
' of course , he will be highly aware of hygiene and how bugs grow			0
' almost always when there is a food poisoning scandal , the reason is simple hygiene rules			2
' people have left food sitting in a warm kitchen for four hours or have used the same knife - simple stuff			2
’ her comments come as top chefs admit they are defying pressures from health inspectors to prevent them from serving rare meat to customers			1
officials are instructing restaurants they should no longer serve duck breast or liver pink and that beef burgers and kidneys must not be bloody , to prevent food poisoning			1
the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) states that poultry , as well as liver and other offal , should not be served pink or rare but be cooked thoroughly , and served steaming hot all the way through to kill off any bacteria			1
critic @entity1 blames local councils for trying to enforce rules designed for factories and fast - food chains , which demand meat is cooked through in restaurants this advice is only guidance , as restaurateurs are required only to ensure their food is safe by law			1
but the guidelines are increasingly being raised by environmental health officers during restaurant inspections , putting pressure on chefs to comply			2
but chefs argue they are better qualified to judge when meat is safe and are continuing to serve the dishes to their diners ’ request , despite the risk of prosecution			1
@entity85 , head chef at the @entity86 , in @entity87 , west @entity88 , said he had ignored advice from council officers to stop serving chicken livers pink			2
he said : ‘ it is a difficult issue			0
but you would have uproar if people were stopped from eating rare meat for the sake of a few dodgy restaurants			1
‘ it is frustrating to be told what you can and ca n’t cook			0
we tend to ignore it			0
you often find that you know more than the people who are telling you not to			0
’ chef @entity106 , of two @entity109 star restaurant @entity107 , on @entity110 , said : ‘ it is ridiculous , to be quite frank			0
ridiculous : @entity106 , head chef of @entity107 in @entity112 , said we are living in a draconian state ' we are in a draconian state where we are being told by everybody what to do because people do n’t understand what it is we ’re doing			0
‘ if you ’ve got a nice piece of fresh liver , it is handled correctly and you are cooking it on the outside , if it is served medium rare i do n’t see whey that would be a risk to anyone			2
equally the customer has the right to choose			0
’ @entity131 , head chef of @entity132 , the specialist steak restaurants in central @entity88 , said he was prepared to go to court to defend the right to serve steak rare			1
he said : ‘ @entity137 has told us we can no longer serve our burgers rare , which is possibly right			1
' but for meats that are n’t being played around with , as long as it is from a good source , it is ridiculous to say you can not eat it rare			0
' to say we could not cook duck medium rare would be ridiculous - we have been doing it for 20 years now			1
' if they tried to tell us we could not serve steak rare we would probably have to go to court - we would lose our business			1
’ last night the @entity56 defended its guidelines saying it was important to cook poultry , pork and minced meat thoroughly to prevent food poisoning			1
@entity131 , head chef of @entity132 , said he was prepared to go to court to defend the right to serve steak rare an @entity56 spokesman said : ‘ it ’s safe to eat rare beef and lamb steak because searing the outside surface of a piece of steak will kill any bugs that might have contaminated the outside			2
‘ however , the same does n’t go for minced products like burgers			0
' this is because any bugs that may have been on the surface of the raw meat will be spread throughout the burger when the meat is minced , so any pink meat may still contain harmful bacteria , whether raw or in a burger that ’s cooked on the outside			0
’ @entity179 , chief scientist at the @entity56 , added : ‘ while i love eating out and enjoy a rare steak as much as the next person , i also accept that there is a serious risk from eating some undercooked foods			0
‘ we do n’t make up cooking times to frustrate creativity in the kitchen			0
they ’re there for an important reason and are the result of careful consideration			0
‘ i think the @entity56 and local authorities to get the balance right between letting chefs do their jobs and protecting public health			2
