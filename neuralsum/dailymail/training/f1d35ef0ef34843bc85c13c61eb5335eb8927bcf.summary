by @entity0 published : 00:35 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 16:29 est , 7 october 2012 the @entity1 was the last of the golden age of trans - @entity5 cruise ships , 107 feet longer than the @entity6 and 50 percent faster than the ill - fated luxury liner			1
from its maiden voyage in 1952 , the @entity1 operated for 17 glorious years and the massive ship still holds the prestigious @entity10 - for the fastest trans - @entity5 crossing by a passenger liner			1
although never in active naval service , the ship played a vital role in the @entity17 and became a symbol of @entity20 power during the @entity21			2
now slowly rusting away in a south @entity26 mooring , the ship which was known as the unofficial flagship of the nation is now at the heart of ambitious redevelopment plans to restore it to its former glory and convert it to a floating hotel			1
scroll down for @entity33 reinvention : the rusting hulk of the @entity1 is at the heart of ambitious plans to redevelop the ship and turn it into a floating hotel like the @entity40 in @entity41 disrepair : the boat operated for 17 years and played a crucial role in the @entity21 saved from a date with the scrap yard in february of last year , a local philanthropist 's $ 5.8 million gift allowed the @entity1 to buy it and keep it afloat until november 2012			1
with that date looming , the nonprofit conservancy has launched a ' save the @entity1 ' drive to mark the 50th anniversary of her launch and her claiming of the @entity10			1
the conservancy has raised about $ 6 million so far but needs $ 25 million to restore the exterior and part of the interior to house a museum , restaurants and a hotel said @entity63 , conservancy executive director and the granddaughter of @entity65 , the ship 's @entity26 - born designer			1
the goal is to spark interest , raise public awareness and literally get investors on board			0
' the @entity1 is @entity20 's flagship			1
it symbolizes the very best that this nation has produced , ' she said			0
' it is going to once again be an amazing icon for the nation to appreciate and enjoy			0
' window of opportunity : @entity83 mogul @entity82 saved the ship from the scrapheap with a $ 5.8million donation ravaged : moored in @entity26 , the @entity1 is now owned by the nonprofit @entity1 the fundraising campaign includes a new interactive website , which allows donors to ' purchase ' a piece of the ship for $ 1 per square inch for themselves or in honor of someone else			1
they can choose the section they want to sponsor by scrolling and zooming around a virtual model on the website , ' meet ' other donors throughout the ship , personalize and upload images andmemories of the ship , and share it through social media sites			2
“ this is living history			0
once this ship is gone , it will never be replaced			2
it is the last of the @entity20 ocean liners			0
it was built in @entity109			0
we can not lose this ship , ” said @entity103 who is on the @entity1 and a commercial developer			1
the 990 - foot - long ocean liner , which transported patrons across the @entity5 with both elegance and muscle , has spent the bulk of its life in a nomadic existence plagued by shifting owners , dashed hopes and close calls with the scrap yard			1
haunting : shown is an enclosed walkway on the once - glamorous cruise ship @entity1 in @entity26 but even in its humbled state , the ship newspapers once feted as ' the greatest shipbuilding effort in the history of this country ' and ' the most revolutionary modern superliner in the world ' still remains an awe - inspiring sight even to those who remember it from its heyday			1
' the engineering , the beauty , the service , the safety - this was the best , the best in the world , none of the ships could compare with it , ' @entity137 , who worked on the ship in the 1950s , said during a recent visit aboard the @entity1			1
' and it would be an absolute tragedy to lose it			0
' the $ 5.8 million donation from cable tv mogul @entity82 , whose naval architect father designed parts of the @entity1 , saved the ship from a likely scrapping and allowed the conservancy to buy the ship from @entity158 in february 2011 and pay for 20 months of docking and related costs			1
the conservancy 's redevelopment arm is exploring potential partnerships with entities @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 to refashion the vessel as a stationary entertainment complex with a hotel , theater , restaurants and shopping but the clock is winding down along with the money from @entity82 's gift			2
shown is an rusted and ruined interior view of the @entity1 ' the three areas that have expressed an interest in this are @entity166 , @entity165 , and greater @entity26			1
however , we recently heard from a group that is very preliminarily interested in looking at the ship in @entity184 , ' said @entity103 , commercial developer			2
' what you see here is kind of discouraging but ... you could scrape this down and you could repaint it , and when we light the lights at night on occasion she 's absolutely gorgeous again , ' said @entity137 ' and we could have that again			0
... this would be an attraction the whole world would want to come and take part in again			0
' commissioned as a joint venture between the @entity200 and ship designer @entity201 , the $ 78 million liner 's luxury cloaked its military might			2
though never called to battle , it could have been converted in a single day to transport 14,000 troops for 10,000 miles without refueling			0
the once - great liner is still the holder of the @entity10 for the fastest trans - @entity5 crossing which it set in july of 1952 instead it carried more than 1 million passengers across the @entity5 over the course of 400 round trips , among them president @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 of @entity224 , and @entity226 's @entity225 in 1968 , @entity227 traveled tourist - class en route to @entity230			1
the liner 's glory days were short - lived as air travel rose in popularity , however , and the @entity1 was taken out of service in 1969			1
it changed hands multiple times , from the @entity200 and on through a series of restoration - minded investors			2
it was unceremoniously towed from @entity242 to @entity243 to @entity244 , finally arriving in @entity26 as a gutted hulk			2
another succession of developers and a cruise line failed to return the ship to service as retrofitting costs proved too great			0
the ship is still the only man - made object within @entity20 to bear the name @entity1 ' it 's been 60 years since i first set foot on this ship with my mother ... it 's very exciting , ' said @entity261 , 82 , of @entity262 , @entity263 , who stood recently on the promenade where she danced the conga on the maiden voyage , when the @entity1 set a new trans - @entity5 record from @entity165 to @entity226 : 3 days , 10 hours , 40 minutes			1
the record that still stands for a conventional passenger ocean liner			0
' we understood there was going to be some sort of celebration when we were going to break the record , ' @entity261 said			0
' we went out on deck ... but the weather was so foul we came back here and found it on the promenade deck			0
' @entity40 now operates as a hotel in @entity283 , @entity41 she recalled with a laugh that she and the other young people on board partied until breakfast , which they ate while still in their evening gowns and black tie from the night before			0
several weeks later , a friend in @entity293 saw her dancing the conga on a movie newsreel			0
' i 'm hoping that this ship can be revived , repurposed , ' she said			0
' it would be wonderful to see this promenade deck being used again - and having a conga line , maybe			0
