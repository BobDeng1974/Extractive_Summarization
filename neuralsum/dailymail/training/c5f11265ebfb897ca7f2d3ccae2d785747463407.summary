by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:07 pm on 10th january 2012 a @entity3 sergeant charged in the biggest criminal case against @entity6 troops in the @entity8 war made a series of fatal assumptions and lost control of himself when he and his squad killed 24 @entity8 , including unarmed women and children , a military prosecutor said monday			2
maj. @entity17 made the accusations to a jury of battle - hardened @entity3 hearing the case against staff sgt. @entity21 , more than six years after the squad committed the killings in the town of @entity24			1
' the evidence will show that none of the victims were a threat , ' @entity17 told jurors in his opening statement			1
on trial : @entity3 staff sgt. @entity21 arrives at the court in @entity33 , @entity34 , with his lawyer @entity35 on monday prosecutors told the military jury of four officers and four enlisted @entity3 that @entity21 shot indiscriminately without taking time to identify his targets after a roadside bomb exploded and killed a @entity3			1
the prosecution has implicated @entity21 in the deaths of 19 of the 24 @entity8 killed that day , the @entity41 reports			2
@entity21 and another @entity3 fatally shot five men in a car near the site where the bomb went off , prosecutors said			1
@entity21 then ordered his squad to clear a nearby home with gunfire and grenades , telling them to shoot first and ask questions later , according to the prosecution			1
after killing men , women and children inside the first home , the @entity3 went to a second home , where @entity21 stood at the foot of a bed in a back bedroom , spraying a woman and children with bullets , @entity17 said			1
damaged : two men survey the scene outside one of the houses in @entity24 , @entity8 where the @entity3 went on the rampage unarmed victim : @entity71 shows a photo of her brother @entity73 , who died in the raid , and his wife @entity76 who survived the killings in @entity24 on nov. 19 , 2005 , are considered among the war 's defining moments , further tainting @entity6 's reputation when it was already at a low point after the release of photos of prisoner abuse by @entity6 soldiers at @entity87 prison			0
in his opening statement , @entity21 's attorney @entity88 told jurors that @entity94 investigators , under pressure to show the @entity3 was not covering up the massacre , brutally interrogated the other @entity3 in the squad for up to 14 hours and offered to drop charges against them if they testified against their squad leader			1
' you have a bunch of scared @entity3 promised immunity who are going to tell you about things that did not happen , ' @entity88 said			0
@entity88 , a retired @entity3 , asked jurors to apply their knowledge of the @entity3 and combat experience when judging the case			0
the moment the roadside bomb exploded as depicted in the 2007 @entity110 film @entity108 another dramatic image from the film			0
some observers believe the jury of combat @entity3 - many of whom cleared homes in @entity8 - will be better equipped for the case over a civilian one in which people may not feel comfortable judging what is considered to be an appropriate reaction in the chaos of war he said @entity21 's battalion had been told by commanders that intelligence indicated the city was becoming a hotbed of insurgents			2
after the bomb exploded , the squad came under small arms fire when @entity21 ordered the homes to be cleared , believing there were insurgents hiding there , @entity88 said			1
' we do n't believe there was a crime committed here , ' @entity88 said			0
' it was the unfortunate result of an attempt to do the right thing , but it turned out to be tragic			0
' @entity21 is charged with nine counts of voluntary manslaughter			2
he has said he regretted the loss of civilian lives but believed he was operating within military combat rules			0
he is the last of the eight @entity3 initially accused of murder or failure to investigate the killings to face trial			0
six had charges dropped or dismissed , and one was acquitted			0
people who lost relatives sit outside one of the houses that was raided @entity17 said evidence will show @entity21 ' never lost control of his squad ... but he made a series of fatal assumptions and he lost control of himself			1
' @entity17 also showed excerpts from an interview of @entity21 by ' @entity171 ' in which he said he believed none of the @entity3 with him went against his orders			2
a full investigation did n't begin until a @entity176 reporter inquired about the deaths in january 2006 , two months after the incident			0
retired army col. @entity179 , who led the initial probe , testified that @entity21 told him that he had instructed his squad to go into the homes firing , recalling ' i told them to shoot first , ask questions later			1
' ' i clearly remember that , ' @entity179 testified			0
' sgt. @entity21 at the time was very straightforward , very professional and very forthcoming			2
' @entity179 added : ' he said that on more than one occasion as we talked through the events that transpired			0
' army lt. col. @entity188 , who assisted @entity179 in the investigation , told jurors he was surprised to hear that @entity21 had instructed his squad in that way and had acknowledged that he did n't positively identify his targets , a basic combat rule when deciding to use deadly fire			1
' those were things that clearly stood out and troubled me , ' @entity188 testified			0
legal experts say military prosecutors face an uphill battle trying to prove , so many years later , that @entity21 's actions were criminal			1
wrangling over unaired outtakes of the 60 minutes interview delayed the case from going to trial for years before prosecutors won the right to view the footage			2
some believe the jury of combat @entity3 - many of whom cleared homes in @entity8 like the operation @entity21 ordered - will be better equipped for the case over a civilian one in which people may not feel comfortable judging what is considered to be an appropriate reaction in the chaos of war			1
' military jurors may say , look tens of thousands of us went to war zones and did n't kill civilians , but they may also be willing to consider the fact that the individual may have been caught in the fog of war , ' said former @entity94 officer @entity229 , a professor at @entity230 in @entity231 .			0

' the evidence will show that none of the victims were a threat '
' @entity21 ordered his squad to clear a home with gunfire and grenades , telling them to shoot first and ask questions later , ' say prosecutors
