by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 07:23 est , 3 august 2012 right now , at a time where gold , silver and bronze medals dominate world news , it 's easy to forget about the @entity8 franchise			2
but medal of honor : warfighter is game that is hard to ignore			2
players resume control of another @entity14 , dispatched to various scenarios across the globe			2
what a view : using the power of @entity20 , graphics have never looked better there 's an over-arching story line which was penned by actual @entity23 , drawing on their experiences when they were deployed overseas			1
the original characters from the previous game , including @entity29 will return , too			0
the graphics are superb , and run of an enhanced version of the @entity33 engine – the powerhouse behind @entity35			1
they provide a grittiness that was missing in its predecessor			0
on one level , for example , the player had to order in an airstrike to take down an enemy position - the destructible environments on full show			1
particle and lighting effects are top - notch , and already look far more impressive than @entity35			1
everything from the sunlight piercing through clouds of ash , to the flashlights emanating from enemies ' rifles , look almost photo realistic			1
animation from non-playable characters is spot on , too			0
they 'll scramble from cover desperately or try and flush you out with grenades			0
they move like ‘ real ’ humans , stumbling around and crashing into things , really helping to bring the battlefield alive			1
son of a breacher man : you can choose your tactics depending on what 's best weapons will be standard fare , including rocket launchers , various assault rifles and close - quarters weapons			1
one cool gadget revealed in the demo was an unmanned robot - sent into areas decimated by air strikes to mop up any remaining baddies			1
it 's a nice touch , although very similar to unmanned vehicle you get to play with in @entity84 : @entity85			0
another @entity84 - inspired touch is the breach system			2
here you line up outside a door and pick how to enter the room			0
you may want to breach the door and go in with a shotgun			0
or , toss a flash grenade in and pick off your targets with a pistol			0
multiplayer has had an overhaul , too			2
there are 12 forces – based on tier one operators around the world			0
each one will have its own weapons , outfits , tactics and support options			2
the big new feature , though , is the @entity110 mode			1
here , you can join up with a friend and take on the maps together , sharing health and ammo			1
weapons free ! you 'll get to use various real - world weapons , including this beast you ’ll even earn xp for watching out for you buddy , with nifty features like an ability to see your ‘ friend ’ through a wall ensuring the mechanic avoids becoming confusing			1
if one of you is shot , the other can get him back in the game immediately by killing off the culprit			0
it ’s due for release on october 26			0
follow @entity0 on @entity133 : @ @entity134 and on @entity135 : @entity136 .			0

written by actual @entity138 to ensure most realistic war experience possible
powered by @entity33 engine - the beast behind @entity35
@entity110 mode lets you team up with a friend and go through multiplayer maps together , using real @entity149 tactics
