@entity0 will play @entity1 and @entity2 against @entity3 , despite the threat of the duo missing the crunch clashes against @entity7 and @entity8			1
the pair are both just one booking away from suspension , a dangerous situation given the top of the table clash against the @entity14 next weekend and trip to @entity16 on april 17			1
but @entity0 insists his midfield twosome will play at @entity18 on sunday			1
@entity19 's @entity2 will start against @entity3 despite being one booking away from a two - game ban @entity1 would miss games against @entity7 and @entity8 if he is shown a yellow card @entity19 boss @entity0 is unwilling to look beyond sunday 's @entity25 derby at @entity18 asked if the pair would start in his pre-match press conference , @entity0 said : ' yeah			1
we do n't want bookings			2
we try not to get yellow cards			2
' in the last match our opponent had 22 fouls and we had five			2
the way we play it 's not easy for our players to be booked			1
' the game is a three points game			2
we need points , we need victories			2
it does n't make sense to think about some games ( @entity7 and @entity8 ) and not about others			1
' we have to win every game			0
we have to win the next game			0
we do n't think about the points we have or the match we have in hand			0
' they ( @entity3 ) need points in these remaining six games			1
it 's a difficult game			0
' @entity0 has never taken a team to @entity18 before but he expects the home fans to create a tough atmosphere for his players			1
@entity58 is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring a vital goal against @entity61 last weekend striker @entity62 is the only player on @entity0 's injury list after coming off against @entity61 last weekend asked whether he thought sunday 's game would be hostile , @entity0 said : ' that 's what people tell me			1
we go to play , we go to win			0
people in the stands can play a role but they can not score goals			0
' i 'm not worried			0
i 'm focused on playing our game			0
' @entity0 would not be drawn on @entity76 's return to @entity18 after the former @entity78 captain was given a four - match ban and fined Â£ 220,000 for allegedly racially abusing @entity3 defender @entity80 in 2011			1
@entity80 's brother , @entity82 , is now part of @entity85 's squad but @entity0 does not believe the incident will affect his skipper			1
he said : ' i think it 's just a football match			0
a very important game for both teams			0
we know they want to win and they know we want to win			0
it 's not an easy match			0

@entity2 and @entity1 will miss games against @entity7 and @entity8 if they are booked against @entity3
@entity0 will start the midfield duo despite the risks involved
@entity19 boss expects a hostile atmosphere at @entity18 on sunday
