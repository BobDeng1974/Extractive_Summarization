when you stop off at a service station on a motorway , you hardly expect five - star facilities			1
in fact the experience can often be somewhat traumatic			0
but one tourist was very pleasantly surprised when he called in at a @entity8 garage in @entity9 , the @entity10			2
in fact , the toilets at this very unusual gas station were so top - notch that model and writer @entity14 declared them better than his whole apartment			1
the model films himself to present the bizarre toilet to viewers and uploaded it to his @entity23 page , before posting it on @entity25 - where it has received nearly two million views			0
introducing the unexpected find , @entity14 explains : ' i 'm at a @entity8 station and i want to take you to a toilet here because the toilet at this @entity8 station is ridiculous			1
' he adds : ' i never make videos really and post them but i had to make a video about this and it 's about a toilet			0
' @entity14 filmed a tour of the toilet as he could n't believe the level of luxury at a gas station the toilet looks more like a lounge , with magazines , books and framed pictures on the walls walking in through the unassuming door , @entity14 pans around the toilet to show mahogany panelling , table lamps , low lighting , bookshelves stacked with magazines and even shells and model boats on a mantlepiece			1
@entity14 goes on to say : ' this is the shell toilet			2
look at it ! ' and i ca n't capture the smell but it 's super menthol in here			0
' as the camera shows the details of the bathroom - which looks more like a relaxing lounge - @entity14 adds : ' this toilet is better than my room , it 's better than my entire toilet actually			1
' ornaments on the mantlepiece , toiletries and a huge mirror complete the look in the bathroom and in case you were in any doubt , @entity14 shows that it is indeed a real toilet he ends his update with the advice : ' so if you 're looking for a toilet anywhere then try to find this @entity8 station			1
' viewers posted comments about their surprise that such a clean gas station toilet could exist			2
@entity97 said : ' i would totally go to that shell station			0
this is how you treat your customers right			0
' @entity103 added : ' haha i thought that he was gon na show us the complete opposite , like a seriously dirty small toilet with a broken seat and poop on the walls or something @entity112 ! '			0

@entity14 was travelling in the @entity10 when he stopped at station
