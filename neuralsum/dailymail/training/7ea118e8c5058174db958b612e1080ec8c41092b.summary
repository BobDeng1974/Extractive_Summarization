@entity7 , a 63 - year - old mother of three , has let nothing distract her from reaching the finish line - coping with broken ribs and a punctured lung , sleeping inches from scorpions , and even the breakdown of her marriage during the gruelling trek			1
@entity7 said her separation from her husband was a ' desperately sad time ' , and admitted that falling from her horse and breaking her ribs just ten days into her epic trek ' was n't the best of starts ' , but she added : ' apart from that it has all been pretty easy '			1
@entity27 effort : it has taken @entity7 , pictured at the @entity29 , four years to complete her journey from @entity31 to @entity4 on horseback rough terrain : @entity7 faced snowy conditions as she trekked across the @entity35 desert in @entity36 breathtaking : @entity38 's @entity37 are among the many incredible sights @entity7 has taken in on her epic four year journey the former geography teacher , from @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , started in october 2008 on the outskirts of @entity31 - host to the last @entity27 - and is now galloping through @entity46 towards the @entity4 venue			1
she has used seven horses and travelled nine countries on the trek - dubbed the @entity50 - which took her along the @entity29 , through the @entity35 desert , across the desert flats of @entity38 and on through mainland @entity54			1
the 63 - year - old has spent between six and eight hours each day in the saddle over the past four years , as she trekked through @entity36 , @entity38 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , and finally the @entity63			1
crossing @entity54 : @entity7 and her ride are pictured gazing out to sea on @entity67 beach , @entity61 trip of a lifetime : the intrepid former geography teacher is pictured outside a ranch in @entity60 are we there yet ? @entity7 and one of her seven faithful horses are pictured on the bank of the @entity77 in @entity62 it has n't been an entirely smooth ride for @entity7 and her faithful steeds ; the former teacher was hospitalised when she fell off her horse just ten days into her journey			1
' i fell off 10 days after leaving @entity31 and broke six ribs and punctured a lung , ' she said			2
' the horse got spooked and shot forwards			0
i was n't paying attention and fell off the back landing on my head			0
' i ended up having to go to hospital and it set me back three months			0
' @entity7 and her back - up team also spent three weeks stuck on the border of @entity58 and @entity59 because of a problem with her @entity98 paperwork			1
' we were in no - man 's land waiting for all the correct documents			0
it was all very frustrating , ' she said			0
@entity7 's marriage also suffered as a result of the huge undertaking , and she and her husband have split up since she set off from @entity31 four years ago			1
' my husband was very supportive , especially as i 'm raising money for his charity , ' she said			2
' but during the journey our relationship deteriorated			2
the stress of it all and the distance took their toll and we ended up separating			0
' it was a desperately sad time , but i persevered			0
' @entity7 has had to make do with limited cooking and washing facilities while living primarily in her horse box over the past four years wild ride : @entity7 has travelled through nine countries to make her way from @entity31 to @entity4 on horseback in fact the 63 - year - old remained undeterred by any of the challenges she faced during the 8,000 mile trek			2
' if you can cross @entity36 then the rest becomes child 's play in comparison , ' she said			0
@entity7 spent many nights sleeping camped out under the stars or in the back of her horse trailer - often going weeks without a shower			1
' it has n't been comfortable , ' said @entity7 , speaking while en route			2
' i used to wash in a small plastic bowl , but because of the scarcity of water we would go weeks without a wash - it would get to the point where a wash was a treat			0
' throughout the journey @entity7 has ridden seven horses - named @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and three named @entity156			1
well earned rest : @entity7 slept in her horse box for much of the @entity54 leg of the trip , before which she and her team stayed in small hotels , houses , truck stops , or simply camped out under the stars she used local guides to help her navigate tricky terrain and negotiate strict border controls as she passed through various countries			1
@entity7 said the hospitality shown to her and her team by locals across @entity172 and @entity54 was one of the highlights of her adventure			1
' being invited into people 's homes and having banquets laid on for us has been touching , ' she said			0
' i 've even had locals run up to us and hand over gifts - anything from apples to onions			0
' ' my children think i am completely mad , but are not surprised , ' said lifelong horse - rider @entity7 , who added that a lengthy trek had always been an ambition			2
' i think i 've had a leaning towards @entity172 because i was brought up in the @entity189 , ' she said			0
' and then with the @entity27 being handed over from @entity31 to @entity4 , and my children having all flown the nest - it was all perfect timing			0
