a combative @entity0 took aim thursday night at @entity2 for embracing social - issues talk about economic inequality as they flex their new majority muscles and look ahead to the 2016 presidential election			1
the president jabbed at the @entity8 , who he said have curiously begun emphasizing the needs of @entity12 's middle class and those in poverty			2
' even though their policies have n't quite caught up , their rhetoric is starting to sound pretty @entity19 , ' he said			2
' i consider imitation the highest form of flattery			0
' @entity0 also filleted @entity24 , his 2012 election opponent , for focusing on the economics of ordinary @entity12 just three years after he was castigated for alienating the country 's ' 47 per cent ' who rely on government benefits to make ends meet			1
' we 've got a former presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty , ' @entity0 said , drawing jeers from lawmakers			2
let 's do something about it			0
' the rich have done historically well , ' he said			0
' i 'm concerned about the middle class and the poor in this country			0
' @entity24 said @entity55 must ' lift people out of poverty ' while it ' restore ( s ) opportunity , particularly for the middle class			0
he blamed the growing gap between rich and poor on ' liberal policies ' emanating from @entity0 's @entity62			1
and he fired back at the presdient with a tweet a few hours after @entity0 called him out for his newest messaging			2
' mr. @entity0 , wonder why my concern about poverty ? ' he wrote in @entity69 's compressed 140 character format			2
' the record number of poor in your term , and your record of failure to remedy			0
' in a sign of the partisan rancor that can bleed over into social media , the spokesman for @entity77 minority leader @entity76 snarked about @entity24 calling him ' mr. @entity0			1
' ' it 's president @entity0 , ' @entity83 tweeted			2
most of @entity0 's 20 - minute speech thursday night rehashed themes from his january 20 @entity88 address , but in one respect he put meat on what had been bare - bones messaging			1
reporters were ushered out of the room at the @entity95 before a q - and - a session began			0
but he is proposing to add $ 74 billion in new spending , about a 7 per cent increase , to the government 's 2016 budget , splitting the additions between defense and domestic priorities @entity0 himself proposed a mechanism known as a budget ' sequester ' in 2011 : because @entity8 and @entity19 failed to agree on an annual budget for 2013 , the previous year 's budget was ' continued ' – but with fixed percentages of the funds locked up and made unavailable			1
when republicans called his bluff despite a harrowing impact on the @entity115 , the president sought to shift the blame back to them			0
but @entity118 - era journalist @entity117 documented the source of the idea in his book , ' @entity122 , ' showing that the @entity123 pressed the ' sequester ' plan on its own			0
on thursday the president irged @entity123 @entity19 to ignore that sequester entirely , complaining about ' manufactured crises and mindless austerity ' in @entity55			1
former @entity8 presidential nominee @entity24 fired back thursday night , only to hear the press spokesman for sen. @entity76 pounce over calling the president ' mr. @entity0 ' in the 140 - character @entity69 format repeat : @entity0 gave a @entity88 on january 20 that contained all the major themes @entity0 discussed with @entity133 on thursday , essentially subjecting them to a repeat performance he insisted he would find the money to pay for it by pressing for new taxes that will hit @entity12 's top income earners			1
that plan will undoubtedly hit roadblocks in the form of a @entity8 that now controls both houses of @entity142 and seems eager to stare @entity0 down			1
the president 's new budget for 2016 will hit desks monday morning on @entity146			1
the @entity8 is expected to declare it ' dead on arrival ' by monday afternoon			0
' i do n't think there 's going to be a lot of support for going back on the commitments we made to reduce spending , ' @entity150 @entity149 sen. @entity149 told the @entity159 newswire on thursday			0
' it 's going to be very hard to feature a scenario where @entity8 on @entity146 are going to go along with some of the president 's recommendations to increase spending			1
' ' @entity8 are concerned about the impact of the sequester on the military budget , ' he acknowledged			2
a divided government presents new problems for @entity0 – has last two years will be his first without @entity19 in control of at least half of @entity142 – and he accepted some of the blame on thursday for a mid-term election that turned into his party 's worst nightmare			1
' obviously we were all disappointed with the outcome of the last election , and there are a lot of reasons for it , ' the president said			0
' and i 'm happy to take on some of the blame			0

@entity0 lashed out at the @entity8 during a brief speech to @entity19 *members* of @entity142 assembled for a retreat in @entity45
he argued in favor of ignoring budget caps put in place through a so - called ' sequester ' that he himself proposed as a way to curb spending *excesses*
also called the resulting government *culture* of more *careful* budgeting ' manufactured crises and mindless austerity '
@entity0 's *busget* proposal for 2016 will hit @entity142 on monday , but the 2015 *homeland* *security* budget is still a hotly *contested* *subkect*
especially *slammed* @entity24 for embracing rhetoric about income inequality as the presidential *season* kicks off
