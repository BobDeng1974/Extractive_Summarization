@entity1 manager @entity0 sees a fearlessness in relegation - threatened @entity3 similar to that displayed by his @entity6 team in surviving against the odds in the @entity8			1
the @entity3 head to @entity9 having beaten @entity10 , drawn against @entity11 and being narrowly defeated by @entity12 in the last month			1
they remain two points from safety but @entity0 believes the fact they have been scrapping to get out of the bottom three all season - much like his @entity6 side in the four seasons he spent with them before joining the @entity1 - gives them an advantage over teams who have been dragged into the race for survival			1
@entity0 ( left ) says @entity3 's player remind him of his old @entity6 side when they avoided the drop ' you always see similarities , ' said the @entity33 when asked for comparisons with his experience of the @entity37 ' relegation battles			1
' i do n't think there is any fear of relegation and that is the biggest difference @entity3 have over other teams who are not in the relegation zone who are starting to think they have something to lose			1
' @entity3 have shown to every team they play on the front foot			2
' physically they do not show they have been involved for nine months in this competition ; it is the opposite as they are getting used to the demands of the @entity8 and they look a strong team physically			0
the @entity33 masterminded @entity6 's escape from relegation which seemed an almost impossible task ' when you are in a situation as clear as the one they have now with the points they have , they are only one step away from getting away from the bottom three and that is an incredible incentive			1
' @entity0 was criticised for not changing his approach during @entity1 's difficult run a couple of months ago but he stuck to his principles and he believes @entity71 's clear plan will help @entity3 survive			1
' @entity71 has been an incredible leader and has set very good direction for his team , ' he added			2
' when you get into a new league you sometimes do n't get positive results after having a successful season in the @entity78 and you can start having doubts and wanting to change week after week			0
@entity71 has installed a fearlessness into his squad and @entity0 praised his weekend opponent ' your own approach becomes your biggest problem but @entity3 have been an incredible source of clarity , knowing what they are and how they want to achieve success and they are enjoying the best period of their season in terms of being consistent with their performances			1
' you can expect them to pick up enough points to achieve their aim			0
' while @entity3 are fighting for their lives @entity1 have nothing left to play for , 12th in the table on 38 points with no chance of qualifying for @entity102 again			1
but @entity0 insists there will be no easing up as they look to build on seven points from their last three matches			2
' maybe from the outside they do n't see it as an important ending to the season but i can guarantee from our point of view the next six games are very important , ' he said			0
@entity114 ( right ) has turned into a crucial player for @entity1 this season and earned himself an @entity118 cap ' we need to take advantage of the good moment of form we are in now			2
' key to their recent upturn has been the elimination of defensive mistakes and @entity0 said that was a result of hard work on the training ground			2
' the mentality has changed			0
i think we have become more focused as a team			0
sometimes it is unfair just to speak about defenders when you talk about defensive qualities of a side , ' he said			0
' ( goalkeeper ) @entity139 is enjoying a good moment of form and that breeds confidence and ( @entity145 ) stones and ( @entity147 ) @entity146 have become really strong with their understanding and how they are setting a clear platform for the team			0
' what is important is it is something we highlighted , it was something we were not happy with and we corrected it over the weeks and that has been reflected in the scorelines			0
' @entity146 ( right ) is forming a blossoming partnership with @entity144 at the heart of the @entity1 defence			0

@entity0 likens @entity3 to his former side @entity6
@entity71 's men are currently in the bottom three but are playing well
@entity0 described @entity6 as fearless ahead of their clash on *saturday*
