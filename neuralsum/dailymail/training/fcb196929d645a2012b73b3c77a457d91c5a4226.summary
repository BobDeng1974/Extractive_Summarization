@entity1 , 53 , has been fitted with the terminator - like carbon fibre mechanical hand which he can control with movements in his upper arm			1
the new bebionic3 myoelectric hand , which is also made from aluminium and alloy knuckles , moves like a real human limb by responding to @entity1 ’s muscle twitches			1
incredibly , the robotic arm is so sensitive it means the father - of - one can touch type on a computer keyboard , peel vegetables , and even dress himself for the first time in six years			1
mr @entity1 operates the futuristic arm by sending the same signal from his brain he used to operate his original , human arm			1
when the muscles in the upper arm are flexed , this is detected by sensors that trigger one of 14 pre-programmed grips , mirroring human movements			2
the different grip patterns include a clenched fist , a pointed finger and a pinching motion , according to how the user tenses their upper arm			2
he is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of a four - month trial , which it is hoped will see the electronic arm made publicly available			1
mr @entity1 , who worked as a smelter , was forced to retire after losing his arm			1
he said his new hand has given him ' a whole new quality of life '			2
he said : ' i knew straight away that the end result of my accident would be horrible so i asked for my arm to be cut off , which was the right decision in the end as the arm was dead anyway			2
' i tried to go back to work but i really struggled , everyday tasks were extremely hard			0
' prior to this i used prosthetic limbs provided by the @entity81 which were horrible			0
i used a hook which did n’t resemble a hand at all			2
' i am slowly becoming more at one with it , the fingers even move when i yawn and stretch , but it will never be the same as having my own hand			0
' things like tying a shoe lace and chopping a vegetable are now much easier			0
i have been blown away by the robotic hand , i could sit and watch it all day - i feel like the @entity94			1
' mr @entity1 has trialled the world 's most advanced prosthetic limb - the bebionic3 hand - which has transformed his life			1
made from aluminium and alloy knuckles , it moves like a real human limb by responding to his muscle twitches the hand features a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual 's requirements right - handed mr @entity1 , who lives with his wife @entity109 , 50 , and son @entity110 , 19 , in @entity111 , @entity112 , lost his arm when it became caught in an industrial blending machine at a smelting plant in 2006			1
the metal worker instantly knew he had lost the lower - half of his limb even though doctors worked frantically to save it			1
after six months of operations and infections he decided to have a below - elbow amputation			0
but the severity of his injury meant his amputation was n’t straightforward and left him with a flared stump and difficulty finding suitable prosthetics			0
his injuries meant he was forced to take early retirement , but struggled to help at home became his dexterity was limited to the basic tasks he could perform with a replacement hook			0
mr @entity1 is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of a four - month trial , which it 's hoped will see it made publicly available			1
right : @entity144 's bionic arm in @entity94 he was approached by @entity146 - based prosthetics company , @entity147 , in may this year and asked if he would like to trail their latest hand - the most high - tech available in the world			1
it will be unveiled officially for the first time tomorrow at a launch event in @entity155			0
the hand features a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual ’s requirements			0
to make it look as natural as possible the hand can be covered with a realistic silicone skin , available in 19 different shades , although mr @entity1 has not been given one for the trial			1
while the hand has changed his life , he says it still has limitations and the keen musician has not been able to start playing the piano and saxophone again			2

he added : ' when you first lose a limb it can take a massive blow to your confidence			0
people in the street do n’t really know how to react to the fact that you have no arm and as a result you can be left feeling exceptionally withdrawn			2
' with the @entity193 people will come up and ask you about it			0
it is almost like it is science fiction for them which is amazing			0
for the first time in six years i ’m finally back in the loop			0
' people notice it when i am just walking along in the street and they come and ask questions			0
' i do n’t really like people feeling sorry for me or shying away from me , so for that not to be happening is life - changing			2
' since i started the trial it has made a massive difference to my day - to - day life and my health as well			1
' for example if you have two arms , two hands and you need to pull your trousers on , you can do it in four or five swift moves			0
' if you do it one handed you are looking at 18 or 19 moves so your body is forever over worked and run down			0
' with the special arm i can hold my dogs lead , hold the vegetables when i ’m cutting them and even grab my bank cards			0
' it is like being your old - self , with a very cool piece of machinery helping you			0
