by @entity0 @entity1 believes @entity2 possess the time and potential to bridge the gap on @entity6 before next year 's home @entity7			1
hopes of claiming only a third @entity11 scalp on @entity13 soil were dashed by a 3 - 0 series whitewash that concluded with a harrowing 36 - 13 rout in the final test			1
it was an undeniable setback despite the fixture congestion that complicated team selection and @entity2 now have 12 months left to develop into a team capable of winning the @entity7			1
humbled : @entity2 's players looked dejected after their 3 - 0 series defeat by the @entity11 @entity6 , their main rivals for the @entity26 trophy , are the first visitors to @entity28 this autumn and @entity1 is convinced they can be caught before the tournament opens in september 2015			1
‘ results-wise the tour was n't successful			1
we lost three out of three games and that 's not good enough , ’ the @entity31 scrum - half said			1
' but we play them again in the autumn and we 're on the right track			1
' they 're where we 're aiming to get to and we have 12 games before the @entity7 in which to get better			2
' the younger lads are getting more experienced and this is an incredibly exciting time for us			2
' in 12 months ' time we will not be far away from @entity6			2
' this autumn we have four tough games that will give us a really good indication of where we 're at			2
' write caption here care has won 48 caps since making his debut in 2008 but missed out on selection for @entity6 in 2011 , a disappointment that adds extra importance to the looming @entity7 year			0
' i 'm unbelievably excited			0
i have waited a long time to be involved in a @entity7 after sitting out the last one , " he said			0
' hopefully i will be all right for this one			0
there 's a long time to go but it will go quite quickly and it 's massively exciting for us			1
' care has made a full recovery from the shoulder injury that prevented him from playing in the third test against @entity6			0
trophy : @entity6 are likely to be favourites for the @entity7 , which will be hosted by @entity2 ' it 's fine now , but the timing of it was really annoying			1
i got it in my second training session of the tour			0
i was battling every day to try and get it right , ' he said			0
' i ran across to do a grubber kick to @entity79 - a kick i 'd normally do a hundred times - and completely missed the ball , tripped over and landed funnily on my shoulder			0
' i 'd fall over a thousand times in a year and it would be fine , but it was just this one time that i caught it wrong and it jarred at my @entity90 joint			0
' it was bit of a nightmare and hopefully i wo n't be doing that again anytime soon			0
