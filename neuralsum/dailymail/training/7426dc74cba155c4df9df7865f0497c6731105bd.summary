by @entity0 published : 00:54 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 03:50 est , 16 august 2013 @entity2 drinks make children as young as five violent , withdrawn and distracted , research suggests			2
a study found that boys and girls who had four soft drinks a day were more than twice as likely to get into fights , destroy others ’ possessions and physically attack people , compared with those who drank other beverages			1
the sugar - laden drinks were linked with moodiness and difficulty in concentrating			1
the girls were as bad as the boys and the more soft drinks a child had , the worse their behaviour			1
@entity2 drinks : a study found that boys and girls who had four of the drinks , such as cola , a day were more than twice as likely to get into fights , compared with those who drank other beverages ( file picture ) although the potential dangers of the popular drinks have been much researched , this study is one of the first to look at such young children			2
the @entity35 researchers said that limiting the number of colas , lemonades and other soft drinks given to a child – or even banning them all together – may improve behaviour			1
the team from @entity44 in @entity45 asked mothers of five - year - olds how often their children had fizzy drinks			1
the women also filled in a questionnaire about how their child had behaved in the previous two months			0
almost half of the 3,000 boys and girls had at least one soft drink a day			0
one in 25 had four or more , the @entity57 reports			0
the children studied were part of a larger project involving ‘ fragile families ’ – families deemed to be at greater risk of break - up and poverty than normal			0
however , the link with aggression was ‘ strong and consistent ’ , even when factors such as the number of sweets eaten , socio - economic status , domestic violence and the mother ’s mental health were taken into account			0
researcher @entity75 said that she was not able to prove that the soft drinks were making the children violent			2
for instance , it is possible that health problems that make children aggressive or moody could also create cravings for sugary drinks			0
however , she said that cutting down on consumption , or stopping it all together , may improve behaviour			0
guidance : @entity88 , of the @entity89 , whose own children have never had a fizzy drink , recommends children are given milk or water if soft drinks are to blame , the problem could lie in their sugar content			1
a can of @entity99 contains almost nine teaspoons of sugar			0
caffeine , found in many soft drinks , may also affect children ’s behaviour			1
the soft drinks enjoyed by millions of @entity104 every day have been linked to a host of health problems , including heart attacks , diabetes , weight gain , brittle bones , pancreatic and prostate cancer , muscle weakness and paralysis			1
the health and food campaign group sustain wants a sugary drinks tax to be brought in and the proceeds ploughed back into children ’s health			0
' this study adds to the overwhelming body of evidence that sugary drinks damage children ’s health and well - being by contributing to dental diseases , obesity and bad behaviour ' @entity131 , @entity132 the campaign ’s director @entity131 said : ‘ this study adds to the overwhelming body of evidence that sugary drinks damage children ’s health and well - being by contributing to dental diseases , obesity and bad behaviour			2
’ @entity88 , of the @entity89 , said that soft drinks are nutritionally very poor and drinking them at the age of five could put a child on slippery slope towards a lifetime of fast and processed foods			1
dr @entity88 , whose own children have never had a fizzy drink , recommends children are given milk or water			0
fruit juice can also be drunk but in small amounts			0
the food industry stressed that the study had not proved the soft drinks were the cause of children ’s problems and that a bad diet or lack of exercise could be to blame			1
@entity163 , the @entity104 @entity165 ’s director - general , said : ‘ parents should be careful to make sure that their children have a balanced diet and plenty of physical activity			0
’ earlier this summer , obesity experts accused the food industry of devising a ‘ master plan ’ to fool people - and governments - into believing sugar - laden fizzy drinks are healthier than they are			1
the @entity177 on @entity178 heard evidence that industry - funded studies were more likely to conclude that soft drinks did not have a major role in obesity - even though separate analysis of similar data found the opposite .			2

study finds the more soft drinks child has , the worse their behaviour
