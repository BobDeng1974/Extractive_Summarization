by @entity0 published : 12:09 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 13:48 est , 29 october 2013 all parents dream of children who help with the washing up and tidy their bedrooms without being asked			0
but @entity5 , 56 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , admits she has taken her obsession with cleaning too far , unwittingly passing her @entity9 onto daughter tuesday , 23			1
the mother and daughter spend every waking hour at home hoovering , dusting , bleaching and steaming every surface			1
@entity5 ( r ) , 56 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , has passed her @entity9 onto daughter tuesday , 23 ( l ) and they are both so frightened of catching germs and of dirt that they do n't even kiss or hug			1
but the pair are determined to get help before it 's too late			1
' my mum was always very strict when i was little about tidying , ' says tuesday			1
' for example , when i brushed my hair , i had to do it in a certain spot in the kitchen and hoover the floor straight afterwards			0
' the house has always been very minimal			1
my bedroom has always been immaculate - no creases on my bed covers , even , ' she says			0
' i ca n't even say when i started making my own bed or cleaning			1
it 's just always been normal to me as that 's the way i was brought up and i did n't know any different			1
by the time i went to school , i was dusting and wiping the surfaces and even using bleach in the toilet or in the kitchen			0
i got a real sense of satisfaction at the end of it			0
' @entity5 is trimming the edges of her immaculate lawn with a pair of scissors her mother @entity5 rarely leaves the house at all and although tuesday is a student who goes to university every day , studying @entity62 , the @entity9 is starting to have an effect on her life , too			1
' it is very debilitating , ' says tuesday			1
' i absolutely hate going to university			0
i 'm a germaphobe , so i wo n't touch the university computers or go to the canteen			1
i sit right on the edge of the seat at the lecture so there 's as little contact between me and the dirty seat as possible			0
' i do n't like to be touched			2
i do n't even like people breathing near me			2
as for coughing and sneezing - i ca n't bear it			2
i go out of my way to avoid contamination			0
' i carry anti-bacterial gel and wipes with me so that i do n't have to touch door handles or cashpoint machines			2
' i want to go travelling after my studies and then get a job , but at the moment there 's no way i could do it			0
the @entity9 controls me too much			1
@entity5 and tuesday , both pictured vacuuming their rug , admit to always be cleaning tuesday , pictured vacuuming her shelf , hates going to university because of germs ' my mum and i do n't hug or kiss either			1
i know people might think that 's odd , but we do say , " i love you " to each other so it 's just a different way of expressing our feelings			0
' whenever tuesday is at home with her mother they clean			1
whether it be steaming floors , bleaching surfaces , or dusting from top to bottom			0
' she does feel guilty about it , but i do n't blame her , ' says tuesday			1
' her influence on me has been totally unconscious			0
she did inflict this condition on me , but she did n't realise she was doing it			2
i do have my own mind , and she did n't make me turn out like this			2
' the pair star in @entity122 's @entity121 , where they talk about their condition and go and clean someone else 's house who has the opposite problem to them - hoarding			1
@entity5 cleans up the house of a hoarder			1
here she wears a white overall to mow a hoarder 's lawn ' we 're both getting help now			0
the show helped us realise how extreme we have become , and that we need to tackle this			0
i 'm having therapy , and @entity139 's seeing a psychiatrist			0
i hope we can both get it under control			0
' ' i have had @entity9 all my life , although i have only just been diagnosed officially			1
i 've honestly never thought it was a problem before			0
it 's just the way i am , ' says @entity5			1
' my mum brought three kids up on her own and the house was always clean			1
we kept the house nice and made our own beds and dusted our rooms before school , and that was the way until i left home aged 15			2
' when i got my own house , i carried on tidying and cleaning every day , and i got worse as i got older.in my 20s i had various jobs , like working in a factory , being a cake decorator , a housekeeper , bar work			1
i would clean the house before work and when i got home			1
tuesday says she wants a job , but she could n't at the moment due to @entity9 ( l ) @entity5 has had @entity9 all her life ( r ) ' when i was 33 , i had tuesday as a single parent			1
she was the shiniest , cleanest baby you ever saw , wiped to within an inch of her life			0
i changed her nappy far often than it needed			0
she barely had a chance to get it dirty before i 'd put a clean one on			2
if she was sick , i 'd change her outfit straight away and put it straight in the machine			0
i have sciatica and osteoarthritis , so i find it hard to hoover , so tuesday does that while i do the feather dusting			2
' i do n't think i 'm going to die if i do n't turn the lights on and off ten times , i 'm not like that			2
i just get angry and upset , and i ca n't stop until it 's done			2
i get furious and think , " how dare that speck of dirt be inside my house after all the dusting i 've done ? " ' if i 'm lucky , i may get to watch half an hour of tv in the evening			2
but if i see some dirt while i 'm sitting down , i have to get up and start all over again			0
' ' it 's very rare that we allow someone else in the house , ' says @entity5			1
' we allowed the cameraman in the house but he had to wear bags on his shoes , and not touch anything , and we made him use the pub 's toilets instead of our own			2
but doing the show has made me realise i need to get help			0
and i do feel for tuesday			1
it 's not that i encourage her @entity9 , but i just understand it			1
i do realise it 's totally my fault that she is that way			0
i feel so guilty , and so sorry for her			0
i do n't want her to be like me and be controlled by this			0
i want her to go and have fun			0
i think we can get better			0
i have already drunk from a coffee mug without holding a tissue around the handle , which is progress for me			0
