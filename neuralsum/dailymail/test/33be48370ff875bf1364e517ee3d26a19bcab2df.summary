there is a rich and mildly amusing irony about @entity3 fans calling @entity5 boring for defending well , when these @entity6 still celebrate a side that ground out results just to preserve their unbeaten record in 2003 - 04			1
they drew four of their last seven , the lifeless goalless stalemate at home to @entity14 a particular highlight			0
instead of giving a shallow critique fuelled by sour grapes on @entity5 's title winners , maybe those fans should focus on the shortcomings of their own players , and in particular @entity22			1
@entity22 has been sublime in recent weeks but he did n't do enough against @entity5 on sunday the @entity25 , celebrating the @entity23 win over @entity24 , needs to start performing to live up to his £ 42m tag i 've enjoyed some of @entity22 's recent performances , he 's been sublime more than spectacular , but he 's definitely been a joy to watch			1
and so as i sat down to watch @entity3 face @entity5 , i felt confident that @entity22 could be the difference between the two teams			1
i also felt that @entity3 could win the game , and win it well			0
and that if they did win it well , it would put huge pressure on @entity5 in the run - in			0
i felt there would be a chance that a big result for @entity3 at the @entity43 on sunday might just open the title door for the @entity45			2
but it was n't to be			0
and come the big moment , the big player fluffed his lines			0
@entity22 was n't terrible but he did n't impact the game enough			2
while @entity50 was sending a killer pass only for @entity52 to be wiped out by the goalkeeper ( how is that not a penalty ? ) , and @entity55 carved @entity3 up with the pass of the match to gift a great chance to @entity60 , @entity22 was tidy , nothing more			1
@entity50 outshone @entity22 on sunday as @entity5 showed why they are ahead of @entity3 this season fabregas , who left the @entity43 pitch with @entity22 's shirt , would have been better than the @entity25 for @entity3 @entity22 takes on @entity65 in a game where he was fine , but not good enough to change the result he did n't stand out			1
he did n't impact the game enough to affect the result			0
he did n't show any signs of being world class , or worth £ 42million			0
and then when he had the chance to be the match winner , @entity22 completely missed his kick with the goal gaping right in front of him			1
in the second half @entity5 played into @entity22 's hands			1
they effectively gave him the ball and asked him what he could do			0
if he 's as good as he 's purported to be , he kills off @entity5 with his ability on the ball			2
but he could n't create the winning goal			0
for all of @entity3 's pivotal , meaningful , must - win games in the last two seasons , @entity22 has looked average			1
even in the @entity23 final last year it was @entity89 and @entity90 who stood out , while @entity22 failed to shine , complaining afterwards he was tired after his first season in @entity94 football			1
he was the most expensive player on the pitch on sunday and come the end of his @entity3 career he will be judged on his impact			2
@entity22 could go down the same route as @entity100 ( left ) and @entity101 when @entity103 says @entity3 need a new spine of their team , it 's time to start listening a player with a huge reputation signed for such a huge amount has to be more than just sublime			1
he has to have a major impact in the big games , he has to take the team to another level			0
two seasons have gone and @entity22 has failed to do that at @entity3			1
there are other big signings with big reputations who have flopped in the @entity119 – @entity101 , @entity120 , @entity100 , and we 're still waiting for the biggest of them all – @entity123 - to show us what he can do			1
@entity22 could be joining that list unless he delivers something amazing next season			2
when an @entity3 legend like @entity103 points out that after all this time @entity129 has constructed a team without a spine – @entity103 said they need a goalkeeper , a centre half , a defensive midfielder , and a top striker – you have to listen			0
he 's right of course , but the knock - on effect is that the top players @entity3 have in their team need to deliver something extra special			2
and @entity22 has failed to do that			2
in one of the biggest games of @entity3 's season , @entity22 missed his kick when a late opportunity came his way @entity3 fans are defensive of the @entity152 midfielder but that is merely a sign of their low expectations @entity103 said what all @entity3 fans know , but most refuse to admit – @entity158 would have had a bigger impact in that team this season than @entity22 has			1
there 's a lot of goodwill from @entity3 fans towards @entity22 – they want him to be the hero , they want him to be their superstar			1
and that desperation means some have over-praised his performances			0
they 're hoping it 's some kind of twisted self - fulfilling prophecy – if they keep saying @entity22 is brilliant , then maybe he will be			2
witness this tweet about @entity22 from @entity3 fan @ girlgooner two weeks ago : ' i still ca n't believe he plays for my team @entity3 , i think we are very lucky , he 's a very special player			1
' it seems you only have to sign for @entity3 these days to be a legend			0
that 's how well @entity129 has managed and manipulated standards and expectations at this once great football club			0
as for @entity22 , he 's been good			0
but he needs to be brilliant .			0

@entity22 failed to deliver against @entity5 despite a perfect opportunity
@entity50 would have had a bigger impact at @entity3 this season
@entity22 showed poor technique when he had the chance to be a match winner
he may be a @entity100 , @entity101 or @entity120
