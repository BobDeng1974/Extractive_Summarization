minding their manners : young pupils at exclusive @entity7 have been told they must improve their manners after failing their headteacher 's ' @entity4 ' ' i witnessed some pretty poor behaviour from a couple of normally incredibly polite and considerate boys this week , ' he had written in january			1
' it was not directed at a teacher or another boy in the school , but directed towards their driver and nanny , respectively			2
' i really was taken aback by the way that these boys spoke and their lack of respect towards an adult			0
' mr @entity13 said the incident had prompted him to set up the @entity4 at the £ 16,935 a year school , telling parents they had his full support when it came to disciplining their children if they were rude to family members			1
in his latest letter to parents , mr @entity13 said that his initiative had improved standards of manners and courtesy in the school , and that both visitors and staff had been impressed with the politeness exhibited by pupils , who are aged between four and eight			1
alumni : the children at the private school , formed as a sister school to @entity21 where @entity23 @entity22 and @entity24 were pupils , were set the challenge of improving their manners after mr @entity13 spotted two students being rude but he said that the boys had not fully met the criteria of the challenge , and therefore it would continue into the summer term			1
' the instantaneous improvement that we witnessed earlier in the school year has dissipated somewhat , ' he wrote			0
' therefore , we are rolling over to next term			0
' i hate ending the term on a low point but i am sure you will agree that this is an important area that we can not simply cave into or one in which we should be too liberal with our praise			0
' in february , education secretary @entity89 claimed the @entity91 primary school in @entity9 , where most children are brought up with @entity93 as a foreign language offers a better education than @entity96			2
in a speech to the @entity98 , mr @entity89 said the evidence shows ‘ beyond any reasonable doubt ’ that @entity93 state education is starting to show a ‘ sustained and significant improvement ’			0

‘ like , for example , @entity91 primary in @entity9 – a school with a majority of children eligible for free school meals during the last six years , a majority coming from homes where @entity93 is not their first language – which is just as good , if not better , than the pre-eminent @entity9 prep - @entity96 school - just a mile or so away			2
‘ under the changes we 're making , it ’s becoming easier for state schools to match the offer from private schools			0
‘ instead of reinforcing the @entity143 between state and private , as the current @entity147 leadership appear to want , we should break it down			0
’ responding to mr @entity89 's comments in his blog , mr @entity13 said : ' i have no knowledge of the school they referred to but i am delighted that it is doing so well and is thriving			2
