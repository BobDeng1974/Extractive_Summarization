using a computer , tablet or smartphone in the hour before bedtime significantly delays sleep onset , according to research teenagers who spend more time watching tv , using tablets such as @entity11 and playing electronic games take longer to fall asleep and get poorer quality rest , warn researchers			1
screen time of more than four hours a day results in a 49 per cent greater risk of taking longer than an hour to go to sleep			1
in particular , using a computer , smartphone or @entity23 players in the hour before bedtime significantly delays sleep onset			1
researchers are calling for improved guidelines on the healthy use of electronic devices			2
some experts in child health recommend against having a tv or computer in children 's bedrooms to reduce screen exposure before bedtime			2
the latest study says this advice should be extended to other technology including smartphones			0
a new study suggests the growth in use of electronic media devices by children could harm physical and mental health			1
in the @entity48 , paediatric guidelines recommend that total screen time should be limited to less than two hours per day of educational , nonviolent programmes			1
there are currently no formal guidelines in the @entity53			0
the latest study from @entity55 involved almost 10,000 teenagers , all of whom were part of the youth@hordaland study in 2012			1
the 16 - 19 - year - olds were asked how much screen time they spent outside school hours , and on what activities , for any of six electronic devices : computer ; tablet , smartphone ; mp3 player ; games console ; and tv			1
they were also asked questions about their sleep routine on weekdays and at weekends : when they normally went to bed and got up ; how much sleep they needed to feel rested ; and how long it took them to get to sleep			0
girls spent significantly longer on their computers chatting online while boys spent longer playing games on consoles and computers			0
almost all of the teens said they used one or more electronic devices within an hour of going to bed			1
the study found poorer quality sleep was significantly linked to more time spent on such devices , and it often took more than an hour to drop off			1
a period of more than half an hour is normally defined as long ' sleep latency ' in adults , say the researchers in the online journal @entity99 ( to subs must credit like this )			0
total daytime screen use of more than four hours was linked to a 49 per cent greater risk of taking longer than 60 minutes to fall asleep			1
spending more than two hours on screen devices after school was strongly linked to both longer sleep onset latency and shorter sleep duration			2
on average , the teens said they needed 8 - 9 hours of sleep to feel rested			0
but those who spent more than two hours emailing or chatting online were more than three times as likely to sleep for less than five hours			0
screen time of more than four hours a day results in a 49 per cent greater risk of taking longer than an hour to go to sleep those spending more than four hours in front of any screen were 3.5 times as likely to sleep for less than five hours			1
computers were the device most likely to cause problems			0
multi-taskers who used more than one device were also more likely to take longer to fall asleep and get less rest than those on one device			2
teens who used four or more devices were a quarter more likely to take more than an hour to fall asleep than those who used just one			1
using two to three devices increased the risk by a half of getting less than five hours rest and four or more devices increased the risk to 75 per cent			0
dr @entity138 , of @entity139 , @entity140 , said screen use may simply replace sleeping time or it may interfere with sleep by stimulating the nervous system			2
it is also possible the light emitted from electronic devices may interfere with a teenager 's body clock , or circadian rhythm			2
greater parental involvement in technology use could be the way forward , she added			0
she said ' the recommendations for healthy media use given to parents and adolescents need updating , and age specific guidelines regarding the quantity and timing of electronic media use should be developed			0
' the current recommendation is not to have a tv in the bedroom			0
' it seems , however , that there may be other electronic devices exerting the same negative influence on sleep , such as pcs and mobile phones			2
' the results confirm recommendations for restricting media use in general			0

watching tv and using tablets means it could take longer to fall asleep
more than four hours screen time a day can delay sleep by an hour
study by @entity185 , @entity55 , involved almost 10,000 teenagers
using a computer , smartphone or @entity23 can also have ' significant effect '
growing use of electronic devices could harm physical and mental health
