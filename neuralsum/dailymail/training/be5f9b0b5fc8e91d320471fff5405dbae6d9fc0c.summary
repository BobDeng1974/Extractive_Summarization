@entity0 could miss @entity3 ’s @entity2 qualifiers as @entity4 seeks to resolve the player ’s fitness issues once and for all			1
the winger netted the last - gasp goal that defeated @entity10 and sealed a £ 15million jackpot in last season ’s group stages			1
but a thigh problem has become the latest issue in a catalogue of injury and illness experienced by the 22 - year - old over the past two years			1
out ? @entity0 ( right , with @entity20 and @entity21 ) may miss the @entity2 qualifiers @entity4 views @entity0 as an outstanding talent but will take all the time required to help him back into peak condition before selecting him for action			1
@entity3 face @entity28 side @entity27 in their first pre-season friendly this evening , with their @entity32 qualifier against @entity33 just 12 days away			1
‘ @entity0 is out for some weeks , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ we will see what happens in terms of the qualifiers			1
we will take it from week to week			1
‘ i do n’t want to rush @entity0			1
he has been out for such a long time that he needs time to get his fitness up			2
i saw in training that he did n’t have the fitness needed to be consistent			2
‘ when he is fit , then he can start playing games			2
he is a very explosive player			2
when you are in and out , you can push too hard to get back and end up having to start all over again			2
‘ it ’s very important that we take our time with him and get out his potential			2
if it continues the way of the last year or two then that will never happen because of all the injuries			2
‘ it ’s better to keep him out for a good while now to really get him fit			0
from there , we can get him into games			0
@entity0 is an exceptional talent but you need that fitness to play game after game			0
the medical staff know what to do with him			0
it ’s just about getting the time to do it			0
’ get that sorted , please ! new @entity3 boss @entity4 is refusing to rush @entity0 back into action @entity4 is targeting a new wide player as @entity66 has also been frequently injured since arriving at @entity3 from @entity67 last summer			1
‘ it ’s similar with @entity66 , ’ he added			0
‘ he has been out for a long time but is working well			0
he seems okay but when you have been out for a long time it can take months to get on the same level again			0
‘ @entity66 and @entity0 are the quickest wingers we have			0
last season , a lot of midfielders were used in wide positions			0
finding another winger is something we will look at			0
’ @entity81 is , however , poised to become @entity4 ’s first signing			1
the @entity83 revealed earlier this week that a deal for the @entity86 goalkeeper was close and it is now expected to be finalised within the next 48 hours			1
travelling : @entity0 is said to be out for weeks but was still with the squad as they flew to @entity88 the @entity3 boss has also insisted @entity3 could afford @entity91 prodigy @entity90 – but he has no immediate plan to move for the 15 - year - old midfielder			1
@entity4 promoted the talented teenager into first team football while in charge at the @entity83 club			0
@entity90 – who has trained with @entity98 and @entity99 – has expressed a wish to work with his old manager again in the future			0
but @entity4 ’s successor @entity103 claimed he was too pricey for @entity3 and would end up with @entity104			1
‘ it ’s incorrect to say that @entity90 is outwith our range , ’ @entity4 told @entity105			0
‘ @entity90 must do what is best for him and we will do what is best for us - we ’ll see if our paths meet at a later date			0
‘ @entity90 is a good player but not even close to being a @entity3 player at the moment			1
but there ’s no doubt that he has the capability to be in the future			0
