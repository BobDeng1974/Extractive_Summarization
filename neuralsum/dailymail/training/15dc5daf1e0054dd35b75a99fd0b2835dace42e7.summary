by @entity0 nestled in the depths of the @entity3 rainforest thousands of miles from the biblical , war - torn lands of the @entity6 , lives a small community of people who call themselves @entity9			1
@entity11 - based photographer @entity10 has made the long journey down the @entity3 to document the everyday lives of @entity15 villagers who adhere to ancient @entity18 traditions that go back thousands of years in a series of striking black and white photographs			1
officially called @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , the evangelical sect that seamlessly blends @entity25 traditions was founded in 1958 by @entity26 , a shoemaker from a small @entity15 village			1
welcome to the promised land : for the past six decades , a small community of @entity15 calling themselves @entity9 have been living in the @entity3 rainforest according to biblical laws humble beginnings : the evangelical sect called @entity21 was founded in 1958 by @entity26 , a cobbler from @entity15 in the footsteps of a prophet : @entity26 proclaimed that he had been chosen by @entity37 to build a new @entity38 in the @entity3 wilderness - and many people answered his call ancient fashions : the men in the community grow out their hair and beards , while the women dress modestly and cover their tresses with kerchiefs weekend warriors : from sunday to friday , the men keep their long hair covered and dress in plain clothes while going about their work , but on saturday they don flowing robes to take part in a community celebration of the @entity59 melting pot of beliefs : @entity9 gather in their sanctuary to read the bible , which contains both the @entity25 and @entity64 @entity10 writes in his artist statement that @entity26 , a big fan of @entity67 ’s biblical movie epics , converted from @entity68 to @entity69 some six decades ago			1
a few years later , the @entity15 cobbler proclaimed that he had been chosen by @entity37 to build a new @entity38 in the @entity3 rainforest – and some of his countrymen answered his call			1
men and women from all over @entity15 left their homes and businesses , flocking to @entity79 ’s self - styled new promised land in the tropical forest			2
like modern - day @entity81 and @entity83 , @entity79 ’s @entity9 observe the @entity59 – the traditional day of rest – on saturday , but do not celebrate @entity85 or @entity86 , and do not display crosses or images of saints			2
the sect members strictly follow the @entity91 , which they refer to as the @entity92 ; a large copy of the holy @entity91 is displayed along with a small ark in the sanctuary of the congregation			2
in line with @entity100 traditions , men grow out their hair and beards while women keep their tresses covered with kerchiefs			0
music to their ears : the congregants pray and sing hymns to the tune of a brass band like modern - day @entity81 and @entity83 , @entity79 's @entity9 observe the sabbath on saturday , but do not celebrate @entity85 or @entity86 village life : women in the village work as teachers and care for their children ; the kids of @entity9 attend school , play and do their chores @entity123 : this image shows three generations of women from the same @entity100 family living on the shores of the @entity3 fresh view : @entity11 - based photographer @entity10 has made the long journey down the @entity3 to document the everyday lives of the extraordinary @entity15 villagers joyful noise : young women dressed in their finest play tambourines festooned with colorful ribbons during the village 's weekly festivities separated : boys sit with male members of the congregation during a sabbath sermon , while women pray in a different section of the sanctuary from sunday through friday , the men wear regular clothes and hide their flowing locks beneath baseball caps as they go about farming , fishing and tending their livestock			1
the women teach in the local school and care for children			0
when saturday arrives , the community comes together for elaborate , day - long festivities that feature bible readings , singing of hymns to the tune of a brass band and a feast			2
the men attend the weekly celebration dressed in flowing robes straight out of @entity67 ’s @entity91 ; the women don their saturday ’s best , while young girls come to the event rattling tambourines decorated with multi-colored ribbons			0
after more prayers and pious readings in the sanctuary , the celebration culminates with an animal sacrifice carried out by @entity174 ’ priests on a special altar			0
the community ’s offering to @entity37 - a lamb , bull or a handful of doves – is meticulously cleaned , rubbed with salt and olive oil before being placed on a large pyre			0
as flames begin to consume the sacrificial animal , men , women and children in the audience pray - not unlike their spiritual ancestors surely did in the @entity192 thousands of years ago			0
let 's eat : after hours of prayers , bible readings , hymn singing and sermons , the community sits down to a feast grand finale : the sabbath celebration culminates with an animal sacrifice - usually doves , a lamb or a bull - which is cleaned , rubbed with salt and oil before being placed on a large pyre on an altar peace offering : as flames begin to consume the sacrificial animal , men , women and children in the audience pray			0
