@entity0 and @entity1 were married for 30 years			1
pictured together at @entity3 premiere @entity1 ’s first wife has revealed how the scientist ’s devotion to ‘ the goddess physics ’ and his fame and success damaged their marriage and saw him neglect his family			1
@entity0 was married to the professor for 30 years , helping him defy doctors who gave him only two years to live after he was diagnosed with @entity15 as a 22 - year - old @entity17 graduate			1
now she has spoken about the severe problems caused by his growing renown , the pressure she came under to idolise him and her guilt at relying on their son @entity25 to care for his father when the boy was only ten			1
her decision to leave professor @entity1 for choirmaster @entity30 is also discussed in an interview with @entity32 , given to mark the release of the film @entity3 based on her memoir travelling to @entity37 and starring @entity38 as @entity1 and @entity39 as @entity0			1
miss @entity0 , 70 , said ‘ the goddess @entity41 ’ became ‘ @entity1 ’s idol ’ and he would sometimes spend ‘ a whole weekend in his wheelchair , elbow resting on his knee like @entity49 ’s thinker			1
he would n’t take any notice of the children , or of me , and i would become very worried ’			2
in 1988 , shortly after the publication of his book @entity54 , which has sold 10million copies in 40 languages and in which he explains how our universe began , miss @entity0 said ‘ life became very complicated			0
‘ i rather felt that the family had been left behind			0
to me , @entity1 was my husband and the father of my children ; one does not say to one ’s husband , “ oh , you ’re so clever ! i must worship the ground under your feet , or in this case , wheels ”			1
i found this kind of sycophantic attitude – the attitude adopted by so many people around @entity1 – exceptionally frustrating			1
’ professor @entity1 ’s condition has left him in a wheelchair for almost half a century and able to communicate only through a voice synthesizer operated by a muscle in his cheek			1
as his health deteriorated , they shunned help from carers for many years and miss @entity0 confesses she turned to @entity25 , the eldest child			1
she said : ‘ there were times when it became all too much			0
the hardest thing was that in my exhaustion i grew to depend on @entity25 , when he was only about ten years old			0
our gorgeous child who was so willing to help was having to do things for his father that children really should n’t have to			0
‘ @entity1 did n’t want to admit that we needed “ outside ” help because every stage of deterioration – walking with a stick , having to be fed , having to resort to a wheelchair – hit him very hard			2
naturally he was in denial but also his mind was so deeply involved with the intellectual realms of research into the origins of the universe that he did not have time to think about more mundane matters			0
’ when carers were eventually brought in , the scenario was not as miss @entity0 had hoped : ‘ i expected that carers came into the home to help look after the disabled person and respect the rest of the family			1
very few of them did that			0
i was desperate ; i did n’t think i could carry on , because i was so drained			0
’ professor @entity1 , pictured with @entity0 and their children			1
the couple separated in 1990 and later divorced she met musician @entity30 through singing in a church choir and a deep friendship followed			0
realising they were drawn to each other , she wrestled with her feelings and the tie to professor @entity1 she did not feel able to sever			2
she said : ‘ it would have been easier , in some ways , simply to have walked away , but i could not contemplate doing that because i had devoted myself to @entity1 and the children for so long			2
’ miss @entity0 hints a third party may eventually have caused the breakdown of her marriage , saying : ‘ the end of the marriage was very traumatic			1
it was predictable that someone would exploit the situation and tell @entity1 that he should n’t be putting up with such an arrangement			0
’ she separated from @entity148 in 1990 and they later divorced			0
he went on to marry his carer , @entity150 , in 1995 , and their marriage , which ended after 11 years , was dogged by allegations that miss @entity150 physically abused him – claims he has always denied			2
miss @entity0 married mr @entity30 in 1997 but says she always remained in professor @entity1 ’s life : ‘ after all the years that @entity1 and i were together , all we had achieved together and the three children we had had together , i still felt that i was needed in a rather ill - defined , protective way			1
‘ after @entity1 ’s second divorce , it became possible for us to communicate again			2
he lives ten minutes from us and i call in every so often to discuss family matters			0
when the family are here in @entity17 , we have meals together			0
