by @entity0 for @entity1 the largest outbreak of the deadly disease @entity3 was caused by an infected bat biting a toddler say a group of international researchers			1
the 17 - strong team of @entity10 and @entity11 tropical disease researchers , ecologists and anthropologists have spent three weeks investigating the outbreak of the disease in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
the researchers captured the bats and other creatures near the village of @entity22 in remote eastern @entity15 , where the present epidemic began in december 2013			1
fruit bats , however , are widely eaten in rural west africa – either smoked , grilled or in a spicy soup the boy was bitten and passed the infection on to his mother and both were dead within a week			1
the disease was then spread far and wide by mourners who came to the funeral			1
scientists have long believed that bats are the main carriers for the disease but it is rare for them to pass it on to man			1
most of the previous outbreaks have been caused by meat from dead infected animals collected by hunters who then sell it on			1
fruit bats , however , are widely eaten in rural west africa – either smoked , grilled or in a spicy soup			2
the team lead by epidemiologist @entity52 , a disease ecologist at the @entity54 in @entity55 , are expected to publish their results in a major journal soon			2
initial research believed that a new strain of @entity3 had emerged in @entity32 but according to @entity60 the strain of the disease is one related to as @entity63 , identified more than 10 years ago in the @entity64			2
@entity66 - coloured fruit bats taking off from largest colony on @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70			2
@entity60 ’s team believe that an infected straw - coloured fruit bat brought the disease to @entity15			1
the mammals are known to travel long distances and usually settle in forests near cities			2
more than 1,300 people have died in the current epidemic many in @entity16			0
@entity60 said : " we spent eight days in @entity22			1
they told us they regularly catch bats , like every other village in @entity15 , @entity83 and @entity16			1
the evidence is not 100 per cent and we can only say that it is possible			0
‘ they can travel far in one night			0
i do n't think an individual bat or colony migrated all the way from @entity64 or @entity91 to @entity32			0
these big colonies are connected			0
there is a possibility for the virus to mix between colonies			0
[ the bats ] share the same fruit			0
it is likely not to have even been one species of bat			0
the virus may jump from one species to another			0
" if the bat theory confirmed , locals would try to destroy the colonies which says @entity60 ‘ would be an ecological disaster because bats pollinate plants and devour insects			0
and bat hunts would also only increase human contact with potentially infected animals			0

@entity114 began in december 2013 near village of @entity22 in eastern @entity15
within a week of infection boy and his mother were dead
mourners passed the disease on after *contracting* it at the funeral
