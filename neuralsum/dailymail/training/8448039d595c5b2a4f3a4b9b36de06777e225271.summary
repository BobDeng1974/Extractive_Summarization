in the search for ultimate beauty , many women - and some men - choose to lengthen their eyelashes			0
but a study has claimed that doing so can have detrimental effects and prevent them doing what they were supposed to do			0
the scientists say that eyelashes should not be longer than a third the width of your eye , otherwise they are less effective at keeping eyes moist and clean			1
scientists at the @entity17 studied eyelash length ( stock image shown )			1
they say they should not be longer than a third of your eye width			1
in the study they looked at 22 different species of mammal			1
they found that eyelashes played an important role in keeping eyes moist and dust - free the research , to be published in the @entity32 , was carried out by scientists from the @entity17			1
they reported that , while some of the benefits of eyelashes were already known , there were lesser known effects that would be hindered by making them longer			2
‘ we essentially found that there filtering aspect of eyelashes could help reduce the amount of airborne particulate [ dust ] deposited onto the eye , ’ phd student and author of the study @entity42 told @entity43			1
in their study they looked at 22 diverse species of mammals , ‘ from hedgehogs to giraffes , ’ and found that optimal eyelash length was typically one third an eye 's width			1
eye experts have discovered a drug used to treat glaucoma can also boost the growth and prominence of eyelashes			0
in a year - long trial , researchers at @entity68 and @entity69 in the @entity70 analysed the effects of a daily application of bimatoprost to the upper eyelid of patients with poor eyelash growth , known as idiopathic hypotrichosis , or eyelash loss as a result of recent chemotherapy			0
conventionally , under the brand name @entity84 , the drug has been used in eye drop form to decrease the amount of fluid in the eye and reduce eye pressure , treating both glaucoma and ocular hypertension			0
a total of 368 patients - four men and 364 women - of an average age of 50 - years - old took part in the study , which found length in those with idiopathic hypotrichosis increased from 5.69mm to 7.12mm after six months and thickness from 0.79mm² to 1.30mm²			2
any more , and they were less effective			0
mr @entity42 added there was no optimal minimal length , but positive effects started to be noticed ‘ above a length of zero			0
’ using synthetic meshes to simulate eyelashes , they then tested their aerodynamic capabilities in wind tunnel experiments			0
when the eyelashes were the appropriate length , one third the eye width , they reduced evaporation and dust accumulation by 50 per cent			1
the ability was due to the reduced air flow over the eye from the eyelashes			2
lengthening the eyelashes , however , stopped this ability from working			0
when they were too long , they no longer trapped air , and instead funneled air onto the eye - increasing evaporation and dust accumulation			1
in other words , they made them drier and dustier			0
‘ beyond a certain length , which was about a third of the eye , the evaporation rate would increase , ’ said mr @entity42			0
‘ to get any sort of length they need to be bigger than no lashes , but beyond the optimal length they attract more air flow			0
’ celebrities like @entity146 are known for their long eyelashes , but are they making their eyes dry and dusty in the process ? ‘ we essentially found that there filtering aspect of eyelashes could help reduce the amount of [ dust ] , ’ phd student and author of the study @entity42 told @entity43 in their study they looked at 22 diverse species of mammals , ‘ from hedgehogs to giraffes , ’ and found that optimal eyelash length was typically one third an eye 's width , as shown in this diagram			1
the researchers came to the conclusion by testing synthetic eyelashes in wind tunnel experiments while there is an aesthetic aspect to the research , there is also a less obvious conclusion to come out of it : space exploration			0
the researchers say that their studies could help develop cleaning devices for optical sensors and even rovers on other planets			0
specifically , mr @entity42 says the research could help clean solar panels on rovers on @entity186			1
@entity189 ’s @entity188 rovers , only the latter of which is still active , were both powered by solar panels			2
however , when the @entity186 winter came along , it brought with it intense dust storms for a few months			2
in order to survive these for a few months , the rovers needed to angle themselves towards the sun , to ensure they got as much sunlight as possible and stayed alive if their panels were covered in dust			2
if the rover survived , the panels were often cleaned at a later date by the @entity186 wind			2
this is ultimately what led to the demise of the @entity206 in 2010 ; when it became stuck in soft soil , it was unable to orientate itself towards the sun and survive the @entity186 winter			0
the researchers found that the longer the eyelashes , the more air was directed towards the eye ( shown in image )			2
this brought more dust with it , and prevented the eye from staying moist			2
‘ beyond a certain length , which was about a third of the eye , the evaporation rate would increase , ’ said mr @entity42 pictured is the spirit rover , which in early 2010 succumbed to the @entity186 weather and ultimately ceased contact with @entity234 after it became stuck in soil and its solar panels were covered in dust			1
this new research , however , could apparently help develop cleaning devices for panels on future rovers mr @entity42 and his team , therefore , suggest that their technique could be used to create small meshes on the rover that protect future solar panels from dust			1
‘ trying to prevent the accumulation of dust on the surface [ of the solar panels ] would help it function autonomously without it powering down and waiting for @entity186 winds to remove particles , ' he said			1
the current @entity257 , however , has a plutonium power source , as solar panels were deemed insufficient to power the large car - sized machine on @entity186			1
but maybe on future smaller rovers , @entity189 will consider employing these synthetic eyelashes to keep them operational			0
for now , the research is more applicable here on @entity234			0
beauty experts take note : do n’t make your eyelashes longer than a third of your eye width , or it could spell trouble for your sight .			1

scientists at the @entity17 studied eyelash length
they found that they should not be longer than a third of your eye width
in the study the scientists looked at 22 different species of mammal
they found that eyelashes played an important role in keeping eyes moist and preventing dust from accumulating
but when they were too long they allowed too much air over the eyes
this made them dry and also brought too much dust
the research could also help keep solar panels on @entity186 rovers clean
