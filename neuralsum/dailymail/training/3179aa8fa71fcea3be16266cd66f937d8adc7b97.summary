the paralysed man in charge of assessing benefit claimants has said the @entity3 expects too little of disabled people			2
dr @entity5 , who broke his neck during a rugby accident 33 years ago , said society is letting down the disabled by not demanding a contribution from them			1
the 53 - year - old now leads the team that will assess those who apply for the personal independence payments , which will replace the disability living allowance			2
outspoken : dr @entity5 says disabled people should be encouraged to do more for themselves dr @entity5 said : ‘ we need to move to a culture where employers recognise employment is therapeutic as opposed to illness - creating			1
‘ it is far better to go back to work to get better than to wait to get better to get back to work			0
use work as a therapeutic intervention			0
’ dr @entity5 – who trained himself to breathe by using his diaphragm rather than his chest muscles – believes more than 20 per cent of @entity3 ’s five million disabled have wrongly become dependent on benefits			1
he said ‘ at least a million , probably north of a million ’ of those ‘ deemed to be disabled ... have got there through system failure and the way society is organised ’			2
the father of four – who receives @entity34 himself and will be assessed for the new benefit – said that minor injuries had become ‘ a very common avenue towards multiple benefit receipt ’			0
courage : dr @entity5 was paralysed in a rugby accident but went on to forge a successful career in an interview , he details a claimant ’s possible path after an accident ‘ that could have happened at work as a result of lifting a box of photocopy paper ’			1
he says : ‘ it gave you a bit of a limp ; you get a no - win , no - fee solicitor , a claims farmer , coming up to you			0
’ as a result , he continues : ‘ you get , say , £ 6,000 in damages from your employers , that builds your impairment , you ’re off work for six months , then drop from full pay to half pay , then statutory sick pay			0
’ after which , dr @entity5 says ‘ you ’re feeling the financial pinch ’ , and he envisages the claimant realising he can get an enhanced income from employment support allowance , and going on to claim it			1
the scenario , he says , is : ‘ do my work capability assessment , get signed off on to the employment and support allowance at £ 106 , so have a bit to pay the loan sharks back , [ but ] i am depressed and my partner has left me ... my life is falling apart			0
’ dr @entity5 , who served on the board of the @entity80 for @entity81 , was suicidal after being paralysed as a medical student , but he refused his parents ’ offer to look after him			1
he said : ‘ when i broke my neck , my mum and dad said , “ do n’t worry , @entity5 , we will build you a granny annexe ” , and i screamed until i was blue in the face			2
‘ if they had built me one i would still be living there , they ’d have wrapped me in cotton wool and i ’d never have got back to @entity97			0
