@entity1 chairman @entity0 insists the time has come for fan ownership at @entity4 – even if it could ultimately cost him his position			1
the @entity7 club have unveiled plans backed by sir @entity9 , who currently owns 98 per cent of @entity1 , for a £ 2.5million flotation that would allow fans to take a 51 per cent controlling stake			1
@entity13 , whose own shareholding will be dramatically diluted by the influx of new cash going straight into club coffers , has also cleared @entity1 ’s bank debt and halved the overall borrowings of the club			1
@entity1 chairman @entity0 ( right ) backs plans for fan ownership at @entity4 the scheme , which has the influential backing of @entity4 legend @entity25 , opens the door for supporters – many of whom have been vitriolic in their demands for @entity0 ’s resignation – to ultimately call the shots in the boardroom			1
‘ obviously , as the balance changes from 98 per cent ownership by the holding company and two per cent by supporters at the moment , closer to the 51 per cent of supporter ownership , then that will lead to greater influence of other people to have a say in who is on the board and what roles people have , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ that will come out of the process we are on			1
‘ today is about an important announcement for the club , it ’s not about dissecting what ’s happened over the last few months			1
it is a fantastic opportunity for @entity1 supporters , it ’s what they have been saying they wanted			1
‘ i spoke to @entity25 this morning			2
he is welcoming it on behalf of supporters			2
it is something they want to unite behind			2
‘ it is important we understand this is a step along a journey			2
over time , subject to the various approvals , there will be an opportunity for the fans to have a greater stake in the football club			1
sir @entity9 currently owns 98 per cent of the @entity7 club ‘ together , as other people come on board and contribute to it , we will have a bigger group of people who are able to take the club forward			1
‘ all money raised by supporters will go into the club to help finance football activities			2
the money raised will not be used to buy shares from existing shareholders			2
instead , the club plan to issue new shares in return for the money raised			0
‘ i think this is the way forward			0
the whole environment of football has changed			0
there is even a @entity97 government working party looking at fan ownership and fan engagement			0
‘ the supporters put their faith in the club – and we ’ve put our faith in the supporters			0
together , we can take the club where it should be			0
’ @entity0 reassured fans that @entity13 is n’t about to remove the safety net provided by his financial strength , always ready in the event of an emergency , saying : ‘ sir @entity9 is not a guarantor but i understand the point about the comfort he provides			1
@entity1 owner @entity13 ( left ) poses with @entity0 at the opening of the club 's new training centre back in 2007 ‘ nothing changes			1
the holding company and every other shareholder have the shares they have at the moment			0
what we have done is take the opportunity for other people to have new shares			0
’ @entity25 , welcoming proposals that contain cast - iron guarantees over the ownership of @entity4 and the club ’s @entity129 training facility said : ‘ a lot of people have come forward since relegation and they ’ve done so because they care passionately about our club			0
a lot has been said – and now it is the time to get behind the team and support this plan			0
‘ as far as i am concerned , the plan gives people what they have been telling me they want , a much greater stake in their club			0
‘ i am particularly delighted that the stadium and training centre will remain in the ownership of the club – and therefore the supporters			0
‘ i would urge supporters to look at what is being proposed and i think they will find it to their liking			0
things also look to be going in the right direction where it matters most , on the park , and i would urge everyone to unite behind the club			0
’ the proposals will go before shareholders at the club ’s agm on january 28 and , with @entity13 already on board , they are guaranteed approval .			1
