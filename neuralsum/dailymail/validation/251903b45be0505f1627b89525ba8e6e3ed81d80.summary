it is the favourite winter holiday of the middle and upper classes - a week in a @entity3 ski resort , with days spent exploring the mountain slopes and evening tucking in to local food			1
but for some , the time spent at some of the highest spots in @entity3 is focused more on drinking , sex and partying into the small hours			2
welcome to the @entity12 resort of @entity13 , where it seems holidays are all about boarding , bargain booze and budget holidays			1
and the series , currently airing , has proved so popular that viewing figures doubled over the first two episodes			0
with @entity13 having the reputation as having the one of the best nightlife scenes of any ski resort , it 's certainly an eye - opening experience			1
the four main bars , that are packed out during ski season , are the @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and the @entity44			1
from downing shots in the bars , to having an early morning skiing lesson with ' @entity49 ' and partying with @entity50 , the ' @entity51 of @entity52 ' , all things are covered			1
and it 's not just the visitors behaving badly			0
the 30 or so @entity56 workers at the resort will often drink and part as much as the tourists , with one worker admitting she will have about ' 20 shots ' while working behind the bar			1
fellow barman @entity63 admits that in the previous season he slept with 15 girls , but says he is aiming for 22 - 25 this season			0
despite the cold weather , there 's always time to take to the @entity69 , and these tourists from @entity71 take the plunge following a night on the tiles , it would n't be wise to miss your early morning ski lesson with ' @entity49 , ' pictured here with bar worker @entity78 it seems skiing is not particularly high on the agenda for visitors , despite the high costs of booking winter holidays			1
two lively party girls from @entity86 find themselves on holiday for five days longer than they planned in episode three , while competitive @entity50 organises an alcohol - fuelled snowman - building competition , and three hungover resort workers go heli - skiing			2
' we were meant to book it for five days , ' say the two @entity86 visitors			0
' but we hit the wrong button on @entity97 and we 're here for ten			0
' ' everyone keeps saying to us ' you 're total p * * * * * * * s and you 're not going to make the slopes , ' but realistically probably all we 'll make is one day on the slopes			0
' group trips are particularly popular at the bargain resort			1
fierce drinking battles between @entity106 and @entity107 - a groups of friends who had swapped sand for snow to party hard - take place in the resort 's bars			1
both sides of life at the ski resort are show here , from necking beers and shots on a wild night out , to a moment of romance as @entity123 proposes to his girlfriend @entity124 on the slopes a group of party animals from @entity128 get into the spirit to celebrate one of their birthdays meanwhile three brothers from @entity133 , who are travelling to the resort for the first time without their parents , are under no illusions what they 're there for			1
engineer @entity140 , 19 , says : ' this year we 're allowed to go mental , completely mental			0
just go out there and get smashed , every night , just drink hard and ski harder			2
' twenty bottles of @entity144 and a further 20 of vodka are sold every night in the resort 's bars , so it 's little wonder party animals flood the venue			1
the resort is very male - dominant , with 95 per cent of those who stay there being men			2
and where alcohol and pride is concerned , this can lead to a tense atmosphere at time			0
episode four shows how things can take a turn for the worst as skiing takes a back seat for most of the holidaymakers , replaced with drinking , vomiting and fighting			0
a group of lads from @entity169 talk through how the drinking games fit into skiing			0
this pair from @entity106 are forced to show their drinking prowess when they come up with some rival holiday - goers from @entity107 ' if you fall over it 's a shot , if you fall over coming off a ski - lift that 's two shots , if you mack ( take ) somebody out that 's a pint , ' says @entity183			1
' if you 're sick that 's five shots , ' adds his friend @entity186			2
' it 's just a vicious circle basically			0
' the show also explores those much - discussed resort relationships , from bar workers @entity63 from @entity192 's and @entity41 's @entity78			2
despite being on , off and then on again , the pair work out how they are going to surprise each other for @entity196			0
and in the latest offering , the other side of life at the ski resort is revealed when @entity123 from @entity201 pops the question to his girlfriend @entity124 , complete on bended knee in the snow			2
brits on the @entity24 is shown on 5 * and the next episode is sunday , march 8 at 11pm .			0

documentary claims resort is about bargain booze and budget holidays
@entity214 does n't get in the way of *endless* shots and beers downed in bars
but you better not let a *hangover* get in the way of a ski lesson with ' @entity49 '
