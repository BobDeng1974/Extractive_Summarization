@entity1 's players have been getting to know new boss @entity2 and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits			1
here , @entity5 has exclusive extracts from @entity8 's explosive new book on the @entity9 which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at @entity13			1
they are two giants of @entity9 football			1
@entity16 , arguably the country ’s greatest player , and @entity2 , one of the greatest managers of the modern era			1
and they have a feud which has festered throughout four decades			0
some believe that proud @entity24 resented the adulation heaped on playing legend @entity16 , the man who had the place at the heart of the @entity29 team that an ambitious reserve wanted for his own			1
it might even have been as simple as @entity16 once put it : ‘ we have a bad chemistry			1
’ whatever the precise beginnings , the feud is bitter			0
it is long - standing , apparently irreparable and riddled with curious altercations			0
in 1989 , for example , @entity16 hosted a @entity37 dinner			2
@entity24 was among the guests and enjoyed the night			2
it was his family , with the news that his sister had died			0
@entity24 hastily left to be with his family			2
according to @entity24 , @entity16 blamed him for not having had the character to thank him properly for the @entity37 dinner before leaving			1
@entity16 denied this : ‘ nonsense			2
if @entity24 actually said this , he has @entity66 ’s			2
seriously , if someone thinks that of me , he lost the plot - he probably lost the whole trilogy			0
’ the battle began when the pair first met as players at @entity29			1
@entity56 was the young boy in the second team whose path to the top was blocked by the legend playing in the same position			0
both are vocal , dominant and cocky			0
you need to be when you play at @entity29 , especially when you want to be a playmaker			2
in the hotseat : @entity24 poses with @entity1 legend @entity83 after being named the club 's new boss @entity16 was the pivot at @entity29 , and @entity24 , four years his junior , was biding his time to replace the master			1
he impressed in the youth system with his skills and vision but was too slow to succeed at the top			0
their paths crossed time and again			0
@entity16 excelled as @entity29 coach before @entity24 took the job and spent his first few months in charge hearing calls for the great man to return			1
@entity24 , a surprise appointment to many , was struggling to impose his ideas and had to listen to the name of his rival being chanted from the stands			2
by the time he was winning multiple titles and the @entity106 , @entity16 was having equal success in charge of @entity109 but neither could muster the courage to congratulate the other			2
on the contrary , when @entity16 was asked in the mid- 1990s which clubs other than @entity109 played good football , he did n’t mention @entity29 - instead referring to @entity116 and @entity117 , teams that ousted @entity29 from the @entity120 tournaments in earlier seasons			1
the intriguing similarities in their careers continued when the @entity16 reign at @entity109 ended and , after @entity126 ’s one season , @entity24 took over			1
@entity16 had been @entity109 ’s longest - serving coach			2
with 11 trophies , he was also the club ’s most successful			0
but he never forgave @entity24 for taking the job he felt should be his			2
around 2000 , when @entity130 , a @entity16 disciple , was head coach of the @entity9 national team , @entity16 presented a development plan to the @entity9 @entity133			1
when the federation picked @entity24 as @entity130 ’s successor , he wiped @entity16 ’s plan off the table and presented his own , prescribing in fine detail how @entity9 coaching should operate			1
high five ! @entity141 reach the semi-finals of the @entity143 under the stewardship of @entity24 this summer after the @entity9 bid for @entity143 qualification ended in failure , @entity24 went , as did his masterplan			1
success : @entity16 as @entity109 manager holds aloft the @entity151 in 1987 the feud hit its peak in 2011 when @entity24 was invited to return to @entity29 as general director , at a time when @entity16 , as club commissioner , had seen his recommendation of winger @entity158 rejected			1
the other board members , knowing that @entity16 would not agree to @entity24 ’s return , organised a meeting while he was in @entity109 tocelebrate his daughter @entity164 ’s birthday			1
@entity16 made sly digs and refused to work with the notebook - wielding @entity24			1
@entity16 said : ‘ @entity24 has a good vision of football but it is not mine			1
he wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics			0
i want individuals to think for themselves			0
’ and @entity16 was just as critical of @entity24 ’s plans for the youth education system			1
‘ you judge football players intuitively and with your heart , ’ he said			0
‘ on the basis of the criteria which are now in use at @entity29 i would have failed the test			0
‘ when i was 15 , i could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres			0
i would not have been able to take a corner			0
i was physically weak and relatively slow			0
my two qualities were great technique and insight , which happen to be two things you ca n’t measure with a computer			0
’ after the appointment of @entity24 as technical director , @entity16 filed a lawsuit			1
the court ruled against him but legal action went on and , ultimately , he got his way - @entity24 ’s return never happened.the two men are still not on speaking terms			0
@entity202 is not big enough for the both of them			0
