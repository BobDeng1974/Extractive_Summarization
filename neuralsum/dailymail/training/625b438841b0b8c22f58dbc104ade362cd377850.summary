child ‘ judges ’ and ‘ jurors ’ as young as 14 are being given the power to punish thugs , arsonists and vandals with soft sentences such as writing poems or drawing posters to atone for their crimes			1
critics have branded the idea a ‘ crazy experiment ’ full of ‘ silly gimmicks ’ that trivialises serious offences			1
and the pilot scheme is further undermined by a @entity20 investigation which found many of the teenagers passing judgment on their peers have posted inappropriate messages online			2
under the ‘ peer court ’ , offenders are given an astonishing range of lenient punishments after being ‘ tried ’ by a mock judge and jury composed of young volunteers			1
but one 22 - year - old potential judge taking part in the taxpayer - funded experiment posted a naked photograph of himself with his private parts covered by a hat on @entity39 ; a young female volunteer retweeted a racist comment with a photograph of a black woman ; while a third boasted on @entity44 : ‘ it ’s 14.00 and we ’re already on the drinks ! ’ volunteers of the @entity48 , where cases will be heard by a judge aged 18 to 24 and 12 jurors aged from 14 a leaked document seen by @entity20 reveals the full tariff of soft - option sentences available to the court , derided as ‘ juvenile @entity56 ’ by one critic			1
the scheme will be trialled in @entity59 from next month , and is being monitored by the @entity60			1
it could be introduced in other areas , if judged a success			0
justice secretary @entity64 has expressed enthusiasm for the project , which will run for three years backed with £ 165,000 of taxpayers ’ money , saying : ‘ it ’s a very interesting idea ... we do n’t particularly want to give teenagers criminal records if we do n’t have to			2
’ but other @entity74 @entity73 are furious at what they see as going soft on crime			1
@entity77 , the mp for @entity78 , @entity79 , described it as ‘ a crazy experiment ’ which sends out the wrong message			1
and he said the social media posts of volunteers in the pilot scheme made a mockery of a court ’s authority			1
‘ are they the pillars of society people would expect to be sitting in judgement on others ? i think not			0
’ @entity94 , of the @entity95 said : ‘ this scheme combines the worst of soft sentencing and silly gimmicks			1
@entity100 , who is to be part of @entity48 who posted this photo of himself on a social network site ‘ some of the punishments read like a sick joke , trivialising serious crimes			1
it sets a bad example to young people to imply that if they commit serious offences the only result will be a few hours back in the classroom , or volunteering			2
’ the @entity48 will hear up to eight cases a week in a room at @entity117 police station			2
cases can only be referred there with the victim ’s agreement and both sides will be represented by volunteer ‘ advocates			2
’ offenders aged between ten and 17 who have admitted guilt will be brought before the ‘ judge ’ , who will be the only participant in the process aged over 18			2
the upper age limit for court staff is 24			2
one test case dealt with by the 16 volunteers during their training involved a teenage shoplifter			2
they ruled that he should be ‘ educated ’ that his offending might harm his chances of getting a job			0
he was also ordered to design a poster explaining the damaging effects of shoplifting , and give it to the shopkeeper from whom he stole , along with a letter of apology			1
another case involved a 14 - year - old boy who admitted kicking his mother			2
he escaped with a warning			0
most participants in the project came forward in response to messages posted on social media by @entity59 police and crime commissioner @entity159 and pc @entity160 , who became an enthusiast for the idea of peer courts after seeing them in action in @entity167			1
guidelines written by @entity171 for the judges and jurors say : ‘ you are expected to serve as a positive role model ... you should remain temperate and dignified and refrain from all morally reprehensible or illegal conduct			1
’ one volunteer , shop worker @entity175 , 23 , said : ‘ i want to be a police forensic investigator so i thought this would be useful			0
we ’ve learned about court procedures and helping lead the offender in the right direction			0
‘ it ’s trying to get the offender and victim talking to each other in the same room			0
we are trying not to make the courtroom look too formal as we are dealing with young people and we do n’t want to shock them			1
’ @entity175 , who will also be part of the scheme , and will probably serve as a judge is dressed in a sumo wrestling suit in one of his @entity196 posts the 12 jury members will wear blue t - shirts bearing the @entity200 logo			1
the court usher will have a black robe but there will be no wigs or formal attire for the judge			0
officials say the panel will only handle offences deemed too minor to be sent to magistrates ’ or youth courts , where harsher sentences can be imposed			0
mr @entity159 said : ‘ we ’re talking about low - level anti-social behaviour , not serious physical violence or aggravated burglary			0
‘ these are young people who have probably committed a crime for the first time and have n’t really understood the consequences			0
’ of the criticisms , he told @entity20 : ‘ you ’ve picked on what might seem trivial outcomes , but it could be community service to show that the person has understood the consequences of their crime			0
’ none of the volunteers whose social media output was highlighted by @entity20 wished to comment , according to @entity200			1
but mr @entity159 said : ‘ the 16 volunteers are from various backgrounds			0
it is important that the peer jury is reflective of the community			0
the volunteers highlighted continue to have our full support			1
’ the @entity60 said : ‘ this is not a @entity241 pilot			1
serious offences will always go to court where tough punishments are available			0
’ volunteer @entity245 , who posted a contentious tweet , will also be involved in @entity59 @entity48 they are the new faces of @entity251 ’s first ‘ peer court ’ : booze - swilling , sex - obsessed and openly offensive ... yet apparently qualified to sit in judgment of their peers			1
among them are @entity100 , 22 , who has posted a photo of himself on @entity44 , naked except for a hat covering his private parts			0
elsewhere , he boasts of sleeping with a girl whose name he did n’t even know , makes explicit references to sex acts , and calls a pal a ‘ pikey ’			0
fellow volunteer @entity266 retweeted a photograph of a black woman with the message : @entity270 is this ! ? ? ? ! ’ alongside an emotion icon of a laughing face			0
the 17 - year - old student has also posted : ‘ always feel so at home at nail salons since most of them are @entity279 lol			0
’ at 23 , @entity175 , a shop worker , is one of the older volunteers and will probably serve as a judge in charge of the proceedings			1
so it comes as something of a surprise to find a series of online photographs of him cavorting with women and men , and one on @entity196 which shows him in a fat suit dressed as a sumo wrestler			0
one of his abusive comments reads : ‘ do n’t you love it when people are c * * * s. ’ another says : ‘ this hot piece of meat has just followed me ... @entity304 ! ’ on may 3 this year he tweeted : ‘ another p * * * * ticked off ! ! ’ and two weeks later he declared : ‘ it is 14.00hrs and we are already on the drinks ! ’ @entity310 is clearly a hot topic			0
on may 31 he posted : ‘ why am i at work in my birthday ? ! wan na just get drunk ! ! ’ and last year he said : ‘ i need to start going out more and getting p * * * * d ! ’ conservative mp @entity77 , who believes the courts will only trivialise crime just last week @entity318 rightly introduced mandatory minimum sentences for knife crime offences with young thugs at the forefront of people ’s minds			1
yet here we have the exact opposite – a politically correct ‘ @entity329 ’ form of justice			0
part of the pc agenda is for everything to be ‘ representative ’ of the population and this move to have young people ‘ judging ’ other young people seems to me to be an example of that fluffy utopian view of the world			2
the whole idea sounds like a crazy experiment			1
by law , 14 - year - olds ca n’t smoke , ca n’t drink , ca n’t drive and ca n’t have sex , and yet it seems that , under these proposals , they could be allowed to influence the judicial process			0
rather like schools which encourage input from children when choosing a new head teacher , this strikes me as yet another example of blurring the line between children being children and adults being adults			0
would it not be far better to work to stop the culture of children knowing their ‘ rights ’ before understanding their responsibilities , and tackle the lack of respect that many show to adults and those in authority ? i think that a stern warning from a respected police officer would scare many children off crime			2
however , if that did not work for some little thugs , an appearance before a proper judge – or even a night in the cells at an early stage – might be much more likely to make them think twice about committing a crime again than being told to complete a first aid course or write a poem by a panel of their young peers			1
what sort of a message are we sending to young criminals by trivialising their crime in this way ? you really could n’t make it up .			2

young judges and jurors are being given the power to punish thugs , arsonists and vandals
scheme will be trialled in @entity59 and monitored by @entity60
but critics have branded the idea ' a crazy experiment ' full of ' silly gimmicks '
one @entity74 mp says social media posts of some volunteers taking part make a mockery of the court *'s* authority
youths who have admitted assault , arson and drug abuse could face nothing more onerous than being sent on a first aid course .
hooligans and shoplifters could be ordered to help a local charity with *fundraising* or send a letter or video of apology to their victim .
young *tearaways* could be ordered to return to the courtroom to serve on the jury ; or be told to follow home *curfews* or parental rules .
vandals might be told to clean police patrol cars .
