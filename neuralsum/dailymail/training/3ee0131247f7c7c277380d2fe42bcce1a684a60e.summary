speculation was rife after a 20ft wall in @entity9 , @entity10 , was scrawled with the mathematical chalk graffiti			2
the appearance of the enormous equation sparked a debate over whether it was the work of a maths genius or an artistic imposter			1
puzzling : this young boy was left scratching his head when he had a go at this maths equation scrawled on a wall in @entity10 which has been deemed ' meaningless ' but maths experts have blown the theory out of the water , describing the formula as ' meaningless '			1
@entity9 resident @entity26 , who first spotted the giant equation , claimed it to be the work of a maths graduate			1
local councillor @entity31 even issued a call to his residents to come forward and solve the puzzle			0
mr @entity31 said : ' it ’s an interesting equation , but i ’m not a chemist or a mathematician			0

@entity67 , from @entity69 ’s maths department , said : ' the formula looks interesting but appears meaningless			0
' there are small sections that may well have been taken from @entity73 text books and would make sense in isolation , but otherwise there is no greater meaning			0

the formula appeared on a building site hoardings in @entity9 , @entity10
at first it was thought the equation was the work of a maths genius
but experts have blown the theory out of the water deeming it meaningless
