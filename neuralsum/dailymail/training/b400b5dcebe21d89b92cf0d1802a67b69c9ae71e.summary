@entity1 time is a thorny subject in many households but when it is a hedgehog that needs a wash it can be even more difficult			2
this prickly customer is fast becoming an internet sensation after a video appeared online of him taking a bath			1
at first the little hedgehog - named @entity10 - does not appear too keen on having a wash but once in the sink he proves amazingly buoyant			1
initially the hedgehog stays fairly calm as he rests in his owner 's hands above the sink			2
but as he starts to be lowered in @entity31 begins to panic and attempts to wriggle free			2
he only relaxes again when he curls himself into a protective ball			0
however , once he is placed in the water ragweed happily floats in the sink and does not appear concerned at being spun around			0
his owner , who goes by the name @entity37 online , said it was the first time he had managed to get his pet to float on his back			0
prickly customer : however he starts to try and wriggle free as bath time gets closer @entity44 subject : the hedgehog tries to clamber free from the clutches of its owner @entity1 time : the spiky pet can not right himself and is lowered into the water he wrote : ' we figured that once he curls into his ball form he usually stays like that until we put him down so we thought , " lets submerge him slowly into the sink "			1
' hedgehogs , particularly the @entity61 pygmy variety have been popular pets in the @entity63 for a number of years			0
in 2008 , the craze hit the @entity66 where animals were being sold for up to Â£ 190 each			0
hedgehog pet guides say the animals should be bathed once every one to two weeks in shallow tepid water			0
they can swim for short periods of times but wild hedgehogs often drown in garden ponds if they drop in and are unable to climb out			1
plain sailing : but when he is in the water , the hedgehog happily floats around the sink buoyant : his owner said it was the first time the hedgehog had floated on his back during bath time			1
