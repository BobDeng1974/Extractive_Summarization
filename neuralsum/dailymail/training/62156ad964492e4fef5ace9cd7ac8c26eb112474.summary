it would be impossible to eliminate all instances of sexual assault and violence on college campuses , but some female students believe they have found a way to greatly curb these incidents			1
women across the country are making a push to have sororities play host to drinking parties on campus , allowing their fellow women to have more control over the events of the evening			1
there is however one major problem with this idea - sororities have banned the consumption of alcohol in their houses for decades			2
@entity25 , left , and @entity26 speak in the doorway of the @entity29 house , a sorority with no national affiliation that holds parties with alcohol , at @entity33 the @entity34 points out that many sexual assaults on college campuses occur at fraternity house parties , and this new system ' would give women - not just sorority members - the option to attend @entity42 parties that women control , from setting off - limits areas to the content of the punch			1
' helping their cause are a variety of recent studies , including one in 2007 funded by the @entity51 that reported women who frequently attend fraternity parties are more likely to be victims of sexual assault and another that found fraternity members are more likely to have committed rape than those men who are not a part of the @entity42 system			1
' i ’ve been to parties run by girls , and they ’re much more protective - they keep an eye on each other , ' said @entity70 junior @entity69			2
' at frat parties , it ’s more of a hunting ground			2
not all guys are like this , of course , but sometimes it feels like the lions standing in the background and looking at the deer			0
and then they go in for the kill			0
' what 's more , as @entity82 , a junior at @entity83 and member of @entity85 , points out , the system makes @entity42 women rely on fraternities for all social events that involve drinking			1
' it pushes us into the fraternities			2
the whole social scene is embedded in the fraternity house and makes us dependent on them , ' she explains			0
' i find this a dangerous scenario			0
' fraternity houses on the @entity102 campus in @entity102 other @entity42 females are n't sold on the idea however , acknowledging that while sexual assault is a big problem on campus , alcohol is a greater threat to women than fraternities			1
' i do n’t think saying there should be more alcohol is the solution to sexual assault , ' argues @entity116 , who is in her junior year at @entity118			1
' as women , have friends around you , and do n’t drink too much			0
be surrounded by people you know and care about you			0
' @entity125 , a member of @entity85 at the @entity126 , echoes @entity116 's thoughts , pointing out ; ' when people are under the influence , they ’re going to do what they want to do			0
it can happen anywhere , even in a sorority			0
' this all comes at a time when sexual assault on college campuses has become a frequent topic in the media , with recent high profile cases involving fraternities at @entity145 , @entity134 , @entity135 and the @entity136 , to name just a few , becoming national news			1
as for reversing the ban on alcohol in sorority houses , that may be slightly easier than some might suggest as , despite popular opinion , the ban came to be by way of a voluntary policy of all 26 houses in the @entity157 , and not the often perpetuated myth that local laws declare any home that houses more than four women and serves alcohol a brothel			2
sororities that are not part of @entity157 do not have to abide by this ban however , such as @entity29 at @entity33 , which does host parties with alcohol			1
and while female support for this change in policy may be strong , men in the @entity42 system seem less sold			1
a fraternity member at @entity102 , who declined to be identified , commented ; ' it ’s just the way it is			0
we buy the alcohol , we serve the alcohol , they drink it			0
we all have a good time			0

there has been *growing* support among women at college campuses across the country to have sororities host drinking parties
many believe that this will curb cases of sexual assault by creating a safer *zone* for women and making them less dependent on fraternities for events
this despite a decades long ban that *prohibits* national sororities from serving alcohol in their houses
others believe this just creates bigger problems by *introducing* more alcohol to the @entity42 system
