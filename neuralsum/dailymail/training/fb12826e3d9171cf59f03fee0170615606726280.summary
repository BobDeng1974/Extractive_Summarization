photographer @entity0 endured a blistering 220 - mile hike to document @entity3 's ancient @entity2 , a landmark withering away with time that he hopes to immortalise with his remarkable images			1
@entity0 , 39 , walked the once popular coastal route in @entity9 during the summer of 2013 and is currently running a @entity11 campaign to fund a book of 100 pictures of the trail entitled @entity15 of the @entity2			1
he crossed sheer cliffs , battled white water and dense jungle to uncover the amazing island scenery of the @entity2 , which was built over 500 years ago by @entity20 who ruled the island during the 16th century			1
and since i moved to @entity9 10 years ago , i 've been searching for the @entity41 , ' said mr @entity0			1
' several years ago a @entity40 man by the name of @entity44 died			1
he was a legend here among the @entity40 's as he used to walk the @entity2 every year barefoot because of a dream he had once had about having to preserve the @entity47 , or the " sacred land " as the @entity49 call it			1
' he was the only person i had ever heard of who knew the ancient trail , who had actually hiked it			2
the next summer my wife and two children were leaving for a 10 - day trip to visit their grandparents in @entity57 and i decided to walk around the island			2
' mr @entity0 battled through pain as he woke up at 5am every morning and hiked until the dark of night			1
he said : ' physically the hike was a bit of a challenge for me			2
by the end i had layers of blisters and my calves were really swollen			2
an oasis - like scene at the @entity70 in @entity9 alongside the disappearing @entity2 that @entity0 is aiming to immortalise an exposed section of the @entity2 in @entity72 , @entity9 , that @entity0 hiked during the making of his book about the ancient trail ' @entity76 was also a challenge			1
the summer before i left , a hiker had died of dehydration on the trail past @entity81 , which is where the lava fields are			1
' i was especially nervous about this section			0
the lava rocks are like razors and can cut easily through skin			0
' unfortunately , i ran out of water here and was forced to make a decision to hike along the coast or climb up several miles to the road at @entity94 where i could find water			0
i decided to hike up , over the sharp rocks			0
the detour took me a while and by the time i reached the road , i was dizzy and exhausted			0
' the first car i saw i flagged down to ask for help			0
it turns out it was a good friend of mine and her mother who had set out to find me and bring me food and water			0
' the highway was once considered the artery of the island for commerce , trade and protection from invasion			0
today , large sections of the @entity2 have disappeared into the jungle or have been completely destroyed			1
mr @entity0 said : ' along the way i stopped and asked locals and elders about the @entity41			1
the sun rises over @entity123 , @entity9 , in this serene image that will feature in his book , @entity15 of the @entity2 a stark example of the blue stone at @entity128 , @entity9 , that locals told @entity0 to follow in his quest along the @entity2 ' look for the blue stones ' is what they told me , so i set out looking the blue stones			1
everywhere i walked i would find ancient heiau or temples coved up in the jungle , pieces of the @entity2			2
' in some sections the road had been covered up , by jungle , and vines , in some areas it had been paved over or developed but in others the road stood out as if each stone had been laid out yesterday			0
' despite being a landmark on the island , there is no preservation or protection for this valuable historical relic , which was once at the heart of @entity40 culture			0
mr @entity0 said : ' i think much more could and should have been done to preserve the @entity2			1
large sections have been paved over , bulldozed or left neglected			2
the trail was an amazing feat of craftsmanship 500 years ago , laying hundreds of thousands of small stones through cliffs and gorges			1
another beautiful sunset scene on the @entity9 trail , this time at @entity163 ( left ) and the fishing stone shrine in @entity81 ' the fact that sections of it still remain is a testament to the people who built it			1
the @entity2 should be protected as a @entity171 , but sadly there is no state of federal protection or funds to protect most of it			2
' there are so many sacred sites here in @entity3 that are not protected			2
some are on private land some are in the rain forest and jungles			0
' for the past 20 years , mr @entity0 has been taking photographs in @entity184 , the @entity185 and @entity186 , documenting the human spirit			1
his photographs and essays have explored @entity191 's refugees , the tribes of @entity194 's @entity193 and the eagle hunters of @entity196			0
mr @entity0 added : ' when i graduated from college in 1999 , i sold my car and bought a one way ticket to @entity201 for the @entity202			2
i spent the next year photographing in @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity191			0
' from early on i believed in getting close to my subjects			0
in @entity207 , @entity205 , i lived for six weeks with a family of @entity191 refugees			0
in @entity203 i lived with a group of @entity211 at a sixth century monastery in the desert			0
i learned a lot about cultures , religion and people			0

@entity0 has photographed the @entity2 in @entity9 , @entity3 , in a bid to preserve its *heritage*
the trail was built 500 years ago by @entity20 , but is now being left to decay and disappear
@entity0 is *compiling* a book of 100 images from his journeys on the trail to record its legacy
