a major component of blood has been grown in the laboratory by scientists , bringing man - made blood transfusions a step closer			1
biomedical engineers have for the first time produced functional blood platelets - the cells that cause clots to form - from human bone marrow grown in the laboratory			1
the achievement raises hopes that it will soon be possible to produce fully functional blood in a similar way			2
scientists have managed to grow fully functioning platelets like the one above surrounded by red blood cells this would allow doctors to create tailor made blood transfusions for patients during surgery - helping to overcome blood donor shortages			1
artificial blood that could one day be used in humans without side - effects was created by scientists in @entity30 towards the end of last year			1
the blood contained water and salts along with a protein known as hemerythrin that is extracted from sea worms			0
researchers from @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity30 , hope it could help end blood supply shortages and prevent infections through donations			0
dr @entity45 added that it may even lead to the creation of ‘ instant blood ’ that can be transported and turns into artificial blood when water is added			0
so far the artificial blood has been tested on laboratory mice who did n't experience any adverse side effects			0
donated blood also carries risks as unless it matches the bloody type of the recipient it can be rejected , while it can also carry diseases like hepatitis and @entity60 , making it unusable			0
scientists hope that by using a patient 's stem cells , it should be possible to grow blood that is a perfect match			1
the new research demonstrates that it is possible to use human stem cells to grow bone marrow on a matrix of porous silk , which then create blood cells			1
the scientists from @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 , and the @entity78 in @entity79 were able to produce millions of human platelets			2
they believe these could be used to help treat emergency room patients with serious injuries by helping blood clots to form			1
they could also be used to help soldiers who are injured on the battlefield			0
dr @entity87 , chair of biomedical engineering at @entity75 who was a co-author of the study , said : ' the need for platelet production systems to treat patients with related diseases is significant			2
' the platelets can be generated on demand , avoiding the complications of storage problems , and in greater quantities and with better quality and control in terms of morphology and function			0
' platelet - producing bone marrow cells ( shown in blue ) released filament - like ' proplatelets ' ( green ) in the study the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity111 , used silk portien to build a bioreactor in which to generate the platelets			1
they used microtubes of spun silk , collagen and fibronectin that were surrounded by a silk sponge			0
the researchers then took bone marrow stem cells and embedded them on the silk along with cells that form the lining of blood vessels			1
dr @entity126 said : ' @entity128 protein possesses a unique molecular structure that enables it to be modeled in a wide variety of forms , stiffnesses and characteristics that have been shown to affect platelet formation and release			0
' they then tested the resulting platelets that were formed from the bone marrow and found they were capable of aggregating and clotting just as they do in the human body			2
the scientists say that the platelets could be used to help study diseases that are caused by problems with platelets but they could also be used a way of helping heal wounds , ulcers and burns			0
blood transfusions save thousands of lives a year by replacing blood loss during surgery or during accidents dr @entity157 , a biomedical engineer at @entity75 and the @entity158 who led the work , said : ' there are many diseases where platelet production or function is impaired			2
' new insight into the formation of platelets would have a major impact on patients and healthcare			0
' in this tissue system , we can culture patient - derived megakaryocytes - the bone marrow cells that make platelets - and also endothelial cells , which are found in bone marrow and promote platelet production , to design patient - specific drug administration regimes			1
' he added that the work could one day lead to replacement blood being grown in the laboratory			0
he sadi : ' i believe that the first step in order to be able to grow blood for patients is to have a model that closely represents the main features of the physiological organ			2
' the use of silk as biomaterial has incredible potential to accelerate this process			0
' several research groups around the world have been able to grow red blood cells - the cells that carry oxygen around the body - from stem cells found in the umbilical cord			1
in 2010 pluripotent stem cells were used to generate red blood cells , also raising hopes that blood could be generated using dna taken from adult skin cells			1
however , many researchers believe it could be another 10 to 15 years before it is possible to produce blood products from stem cells that can be used clinically			1
writing in the @entity215 last year , dr @entity213 from the @entity214 , said : ' despite many advances in stem cell - derived hematopoiesis research , we are still in the beginning stages of making @entity221 available , in both quantity and quality , for clinical use			2
' @entity226 - derived stem cell differentiation of @entity221 seems to be a physiologic and natural way of @entity221 procurement and would be an attractive option if functionality and production quantity can be optimized			0

scientists at @entity235 in @entity77 grew bone marrow on silk
they were able to generate functioning platelet cells that form blood clots
the cells could be used to stop *bleeding* in injured patients in @entity246 rooms
it has raised hopes that man - made blood can be created for transfusions
however some say it could be up to 15 years before stem cells can be used to create blood that can be *safely* used for transfusions during surgery
