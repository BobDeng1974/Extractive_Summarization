@entity0 have been dealt a severe blow with the news that @entity3 will be missing for the remainder of 2014			1
the midfielder went for an mri scan on a niggling knee problem and the @entity9 @entity8 confirmed that he will be out for three months			1
the 25 - year - old did n't train with @entity11 in @entity12 after growing concerns over the complaint			0
' @ @entity47 out for 10 - 12 weeks with partial lateral collateral ligament tear in left knee			0
more to follow ... get well soon ! ' the @entity9 fa tweeted			1
a slightly contradictory @entity0 statement read : ' @entity3 complained of a sore left knee after the game and the club advised the @entity9 fa to run medical checks when he joined up with his international squad			1
' the club will make further assessments and it is too early to say how long @entity3 may be out of action '			1
@entity3 , signed for Â£ 42.5million last year , had drawn criticism for a number of below - par performances in an @entity0 shirt			1
nevertheless , the news serves to intensify @entity66 's growing injury trouble just two months into the new season			2
@entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 are all long term absentees , while @entity72 is also nursing a knock			0
@entity74 ( right ) and his @entity9 team sent @entity3 to receive an mri scan in @entity77 the lateral collateral ligament ( @entity79 ) goes from the top part of the fibula ( the bone on the outside of the lower leg ) to the outside part of the lower thigh bone			1
the ligament helps keep the outer side of the knee joint stable			0
the @entity79 is usually injured by pressure or an injury that pushes the knee joint from the inside , which results in stress on the outside part of the joint			0
symptoms include swelling , the knee locking or giving way			0
it means @entity3 will miss four crucial @entity103 fixtures , along with @entity105 clashes against @entity31 and - in all probability - @entity40			2
he looks likely to be out of action for 12 domestic games			0
a statement on the @entity8 website read : ' the @entity111 examination today at @entity113 @entity112 in @entity77 revealed a partial rupture of the outer band of the left knee joint			2
' the treatment is conservative , with six weeks of immobilisation of the knee joint			0
@entity3 is likely to be ( out for ) 10 to 12 weeks			2
