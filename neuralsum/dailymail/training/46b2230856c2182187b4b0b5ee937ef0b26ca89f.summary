' and i did not chip in 10 grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a @entity3 acquisition			2
' i have the greatest respect for the talented engineers and developers at @entity4			0
it ’s been a long time since i met a more dedicated and talented group of people			2
' i understand this is purely a business deal , and i ’d like to congratulate both @entity3 and the @entity4 owners			1

at first we were sceptical - the headset looks bulky , although it is surprisingly light when attached via straps			2
however , once our demo started , doubts were quickly forgotten			0
the technology , still just a developer 's version , is breathtakingly good			0
while the resolution still does n't give the feeling of quite being in the real world , it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world			0
during several demonstrations we entered a vast dungeon and flew through space , with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as the user 's head moves			0

' the @entity24 is highly anticipated by the gaming community , and there 's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform			2

after games , we 're going to make @entity4 a platform for many other experiences			0
' @entity4 has the chance to create the most social platform ever , and change the way we work , play and communicate , ' said @entity154 , pictured ' imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game , studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face - to - face - just by putting on goggles in your home			1
