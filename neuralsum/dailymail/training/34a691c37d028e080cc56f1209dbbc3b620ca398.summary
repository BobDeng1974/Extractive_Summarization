@entity2 , who had only signed with the club three to four weeks before on £ 250 a week , said he only spoke briefly to the girl who wanted to know why first team player @entity51 was not paying any attention to her			1
at around 2am , he returned to the hotel with @entity54 , 21 , to go to bed , but was a woken half an hour later when his teams mates @entity57 and @entity58 , both 21 , came into his room with the girl			1

he was one of the main characters in the team			1
' he said the girl who was wearing a tight dress then cuddled up between him and @entity54 who were in the double bed adding ; ' she moved on to me and tried to kiss my neck but i ended up shrugging her off			1
' she tried to grab my penis area and i said to her to get off			2
i had no interest in what she seemed to be intent on			2
' it appeared she was doing the same to @entity54 , i ca n’t recall them snogging but i could hear the same thing			2
' he said @entity58 and @entity57 were giggling too and they started taking photos on his phone but he denied there was any sexual gratification to it			2
he said : ' no no. this was never the case			0
it was just a laugh			0
i understand now how stupid it was now but honest , it was just a bit of boy banter			0
as i said it was just boy banter , a good laugh			0
' she was just giggling			2
she seemed to be laughing with us			0
' allegation : the girl only realised what had happened to her when she woke up semi-naked next to @entity2 in the jury 's @entity35 ( above ) in @entity20 the next morning , the court heard but he added the atmospheres changed when @entity51 walked into the room			1
he said : ' it seemed she was laughing , being bubbly and then that ’s when she shut her eyes and seemed to be trying to go to sleep			0
i was awkward but @entity51 broke the awkwardness by laughing as well			0
from what i remember he sprayed the shaving foam on her leg			0
' he said a picture was taken of @entity54 grinning with his thumbs up after writing his initials in shaving foam on her thigh and then they all left and they went to sleep			0
the next morning the girl ' politely ' asked to borrow his phone to make a call and then ten minutes later woke him because she had discovered the images and said : ' i think she was embarrassed ' he agreed to delete the pictures but forwarded the one with @entity54 and the shaving phone via @entity134 messaging			2
@entity2 and his team - mates @entity58 ( left ) and @entity54 ( right ) all deny sexual assault and voyeurism @entity57 , who now plays for @entity138 , also denies sexual assault and voyeurism he and his team mates thought nothing more of the incident until they were arrested as they got off the team coach after returning from @entity144 in january of last year adding ' this was a shock			1
' talking about when he exposed his penis he said : ' i was standing directly above her but that was it			0
i was not kneeling down or crouching			0
i was standing on the bed while she was laughing			0
' it was a laugh , i was new at the time			0
it was funny at the time			0
looking back at it , it was just the case of fitting in and having a laugh			0
' it is alleged the ‘ pretty , outgoing ’ woman , now 21 , had asked @entity2 to delete the photos but he just laughed			1
she later confided in a work colleague what had happened , but was too scared to go to police			0
it was not until another player told her months later that the pictures were being passed around the club and threatened to post them on the internet that she finally reported it			0
@entity2 , @entity54 , @entity58 and their former team - mate @entity57 , 21 , who now plays for @entity138 , all deny charges of sexual assault and voyeurism			1
the @entity176 heard they went to several bars and she ended up coming back to their hotel room			0
but she claims the next thing she remembers is waking up in bed with @entity2 in just his underwear with her bra off and her dress pulled up			1
when interviewed by police , @entity2 refused to answer questions and the other three gave very basic accounts of what had happened that night			1
@entity54 said there was only one picture taken of him with the shaving foam , @entity58 claimed he had fallen asleep while @entity57 admitted he may have been in the background but did not get his penis out			2
