in the nuclear - armed nation where power has often changed hands through military coups rather than elections , the army is bound to play a key role in how the conflict unfolds but it has not directly intervened , apart from talking to the protagonists and calling on them to show restraint			0
if the protests get out of control and there is major violence , the army could step in decisively , imposing a curfew or even martial law			0
