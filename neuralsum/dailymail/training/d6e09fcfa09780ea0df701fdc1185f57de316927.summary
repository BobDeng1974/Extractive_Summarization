by @entity0 you might want to think twice about leaning against a lamp post the next time you have a private conversation			2
that innocuous - looking light fixture could be capable of listening to what you say			0
not only that , but it may also be live tweeting every single sentence			0
this terrifying scenario was recently played out at an art exhibition in @entity11 when a lamp - turned - spy began covertly listening in on conversations			2
not only that , but it may also be live tweeting every single sentence the @entity20 lamp can covertly listen in on conversations and then post them on @entity23			1
the system only took a few hours to put together and cost less than $ £ 60 ( $ 100 ) to make using off - the - shelf equipment			1
this included a @entity28 mini-computer , a microphone , an led and a plastic flower pot. the device screws into a standard bulb socket from where it also draws power			0
the system can upload any secretly captured audio via the nearest open @entity38 , and sends it to @entity41 's @entity40 crowdsourcing platform			1
@entity43 users are then paid a small fee to transcribe the audio and post lines of conversation to @entity20 ’s @entity23 account			1
the @entity20 lamp - its current location unknown - has been active for several months and has its own @entity23 account @ conversnitch where it posts snippets of what it has heard			1
currently the account has fragments of conversations about topics such as a failed job interview , a strained relationship and tensions at work			0
the technology , unveiled yesterday , is the brainchild of @entity68 - based @entity67 and @entity69 who wanted to make people think more about privacy issues in society			1
revealed : currently the @entity23 account has fragments of conversations about topics such as a failed job interview , a strained relationship and tensions at work strangely , the idea came to them just before @entity82 surveillance was revealed by @entity83			1
' we hope that @entity20 helps people remember the feeling of frustration and powerlessness we used to have before we got used to @entity83 announcing a new secret @entity82 mass - surveillance program every week , ' mr @entity84 told @entity91			1
' surveillance programs like @entity93 , where @entity94 intercepted millions of video chat sessions , have destroyed our ability to forget			0
' we were curious what happens when that very digital kind of ever - present surveillance is brought into the physical world			0
' the technology is n’t sophisticated			0

does this look familiar ? the @entity20 lamp - its current location unknown - has been active for several months and has its own @entity23 account @ conversnitch where it posts snippets of what it has heard no lamp is safe : you might want to think twice about leaning against a lamp post the next time you have a private conversation after two @entity68 - based designers revealed how easy it is to listen in on conversations mr @entity130 and mr @entity131 pay the users there to transcribe the audio and post lines of conversation to @entity20 ’s @entity23 account			1
the creators admit there have been some problems on the @entity43 end , with tweets deleted when they began to suspect the @entity43 workers were making up quotes			0
but the pair hope @entity20 will get people thinking about their privacy , as well as potential that they could be recorded at anytime and anywhere			2
' certainly the next step from every government surveillance agency will be to move from collecting digital records to physical ones , ' said mr @entity84			0
' we already see some of this with face recognition databases and surveillance camera databases , but they are mostly without power until they are paired with automated analysis			0
' what happens when people are not only listening to your conversations , or watching your actions , but can comment on or favourite them ? ' the kit : the system is made up of a @entity28 mini-computer , a microphone , an led and a plastic flower pot. the device screws into a standard bulb socket from where it also draws power exposed : the designers hope @entity20 will get people thinking about their privacy , as well as potential that they could be recorded at anytime and anywhere			2
