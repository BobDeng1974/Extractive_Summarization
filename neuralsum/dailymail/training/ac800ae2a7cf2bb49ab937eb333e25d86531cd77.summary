she did this weekend despite round - the - clock care for her harness : a sling was used to try and held @entity8 stand on her legs all hands on deck : while @entity8 had been eating and standing with the help of a sling just hours earlier , there were a number of problems that could have led to her death her mother who was also rescued at the same time , was found starving alongside her			1

' when i got there she was laying in the mud			0

heartbreaking : volunteers have taken turns looking after @entity8 , including @entity99 ( pictured ) volunteers at the @entity101 for horses : @entity103 fashioned a sling to help move emaciated @entity8 ( left ) , while volunteer @entity99 comforts the struggling filly ( right ) helpers : volunteers have worked around the clock to nurse little @entity8 back to health and even help her to her feet , but in the end it was all too much for her recovering : @entity8 was so weak she needed to be propped upright and swaddled in blankets at the sanctuary the abused creatures were treated with antibiotics and warm fluids before being rushed to the @entity101 for horses , south of @entity119			1
sanctuary founder @entity45 said a ' body imprint where you can see every hair strand ' remains where @entity8 lay for ' quite some time '			0
@entity124 and other volunteers at the charity worked around the clock to nurse the horses back to health but in the end for @entity8 , it was too much			2
the horses had been starved for so long , they had no @entity134 dozen or more volunteers helped to care for the horse each day along with a ranch dog named @entity138 , who caretakers said never left the filly ’s side			2

' it 's a very unfortunate situation , ' @entity170 said			0
@entity8 gorgeous : @entity8 almost looks peaceful as she lays beneath a heat lamp , on a bed of straw , swaddled in blankets for warmth so sad : the story generated emotional responses and outpourings of support via social media the story generated often emotional responses and outpourings of support via social media , and @entity45 said the hope for many was that @entity8 ’s story would lead to more awareness and policy changes that would prevent similar cases			0
