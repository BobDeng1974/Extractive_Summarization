the details were visceral , like the shock of the news			1
@entity3 suffered a vertebral artery dissection			1
the impact of the ball on the back of his head had been immense , compressing the vessel and causing it to split			1
the resulting cerebral haemorrhage was described as catastrophic , a massive bleed in his brain			1
an operation removed part of his skull to alleviate the pressure			2
@entity3 never awoke , having lapsed into unconsciousness soon after the fatal blow			1
he was pronounced dead 48 hours later , surrounded by family , friends and crying men who play games , much like him			1
remember those details the next time sellers of apparel inform you that impossible is nothing , or that the man in the arena is a superhuman			2
@entity35 is what the sadly human @entity3 encountered , in that moment when an alignment of circumstances too random to be repeated began the process that would end his life			1
@entity3 poses in front of the @entity45 flag with his tragic death sending tremors across the world @entity3 lost his life three days short of his 26th birthday to leave the cricketing world in a state of shock the @entity52 shakes hands with @entity3 at @entity54 during last year 's @entity56 series those events , the terrible misfortune at every stage , bear revisiting			1
@entity3 ’s death required a bouncing ball to be delivered by bowler @entity62 , not exceptionally fast , but slightly too slow			1
it required @entity3 to marginally misjudge the pace of that ball , or perhaps for it to stick a fraction longer on the surface than usual , causing him to mistime his shot and play early			1
it required @entity3 to have chosen to hook in answer to @entity62 ’s delivery , meaning the swing of his bat and his body turned his head around , so that the back , the part unprotected by his helmet , was exposed to impact			1
and it required the ball to strike him in a defenceless area , with sufficient force to cause a fatal rupture			1
it was as if bad luck decided to hold a party on the square at the @entity88 and invite all of its most unruly friends			2
@entity3 lost his life after the back of his head was struck by @entity62 's bouncer @entity62 ( centre ) is consoled by former @entity45 opener @entity95 outside @entity99 's @entity98 's hospital @entity101 ( left ) and @entity102 captain @entity100 arrive at the @entity88 after news of @entity3 ' death @entity3 was an opening batsman , those kings of one against 11			1
he is used to overcoming sport ’s probabilities			2
yet the odds he faced this week were insurmountable			2
and that brings the shock ; because we are used to seeing our sportsmen as invulnerable			2
yes , they lose , that is the nature of the beast ; but not like this			2
they lose tests , matches , games , races , sets , frames , fixtures , not lives			2
we revel in their indomitable nature , tell stories of their heroism and defiance , indulge their myths and legends			2
we pretend , too , that impossible is nothing : but only for them			1
while cricket mourns , perhaps the most lurid tales will abate ; but not for long			2
soon enough , we will return to inherited memories of men like @entity137 who , fable informs , liked nothing more than a cricket ball to the noggin			1
in 1966 , @entity145 captain for the final test against the @entity147 , he fielded in the silliest of silly point positions in the days before protective helmets			2
close was so near to the prolific batsman , @entity151 , that even his team - mates feared for his safety			2
‘ what if you ’re hit on the head ? ’ they asked			2
‘ he ’ll be caught at cover off the rebound , ’ @entity137 explained			2
@entity137 , who famously shunned a helmet at the crease , is hit on the shoulder by @entity164 ' bouncer a bruised close shows off some battle scars after facing the fabled @entity147 attack in 1976 like much of sport ’s folklore , who knows what was really said , or done ? a cricket ball is still a cricket ball , a skull is still a skull , even in sport ’s good old days			1
it is unlikely that close , more than any man , could have taken savage impact at point - blank range and remained unharmed			2
it is unlikely he was struck as often as we are led to believe , either			2
yet it suits us all to invest , to pretend , to mythologise this world of hard men , playing the game at the limit of endurance , surviving blows that would fell lesser mortals			1
@entity3 is the collateral damage of this delusion ; so was @entity192 ; so , too , @entity193			1
but we would n’t have it any other way , even now			2
‘ should the ball be softer ? ’ earnest reporters asked the cricket fraternity			1
they will not find one supporter for more health and safety measures , even in the school game			1
we have never left the @entity204 arena in the way we consider many sports , and the ferocious battle between a truly fast bowler and an opening batsman such as @entity3 is the essence of cricket			1
during the @entity56 tour last winter , the feral atmosphere subsided , the disappointment palpable , whenever @entity215 was n’t bowling			0
the roar as he ran in , @entity102 ’s own little @entity217			0
@entity145 could not handle @entity215 's pace and devastating short ball in the last @entity56 series with the partisan crowd behind him in @entity102 , @entity215 wreaked havoc with @entity145 's batsmen it is the loneliest position in team sport , opening batsman			1
the ball is at its newest , the bowler at his freshest , his team - mates crowd in , a gang of childish bullies , sharp - tongued and safe in numbers			1
he has a partner at the opposite end , but nobody is paying attention to him			0
they are all focused on one man			0
the kicker in rugby has a solitary role so , too , football ’s penalty taker			0
yet , on the pitch at least , in those moments there is calm			0
no physical challenge is offered , or expected			0
by contrast , the batsman is under threat of harm throughout his intense ordeal			0
he sees the bowler gathering steam on his run , he senses the desire for his downfall from the field , he is aware of the expectancy from all sides , his importance to the victory : and he knows what is coming			1
‘ get ready for a broken arm , ’ @entity100 told @entity265 , as he prepared to face @entity215 last winter			0
@entity100 , @entity102 ’s captain , wept for the loss of his friend @entity3			1
he would have settled for a bulletin about a boring old fractured radius , no doubt , but it was too late for bargains			0
a distraught @entity100 pauses before delivering a statement on behalf of the @entity3 family @entity100 indulges in some finger - wagging with @entity265 ( right ) during the last @entity56 series were fielders needling @entity3 in that manner on the day he faced his final ball ? probably			1
they did n’t mean harm and would n’t have thought anything of it			0
sledging will not end with this tragedy			0
@entity287 will pass and batsmen will start getting told they are going to leave in an ambulance again			0
it is part of the game ; just another obstacle for the superhumans to overcome ; another challenge to be faced down			1
and @entity100 is a batsman			0
whatever he said to @entity265 will have been said to him , too , in various forms			0
there is no openers ’ club			0
i have sat with former @entity145 batsmen as they have laughed like drains at footage of one of their number being beaten up by the fastest bowlers on earth			0
@entity62 was not intending to hurt @entity3 when he unleashed a bouncer that day and if it had struck him with less morbid consequences , men now wiping away tears of sadness might be crying with laughter at the slow - motion replays or cracking wise on social networks			1
all ’s well that ends well			0
the perils of facing @entity322 , @entity323 or the @entity325 - era @entity147 bowlers are an after - dinner staple for many speakers on the cricket circuit			0
the death of @entity3 rather puts a crimp in that casual fun			1
it would be a brave man to expect a laugh tonight , retelling the story of @entity337 getting hit in the y - fronts by @entity339			0
suddenly , it is all too real : @entity3 makes us realise the shallowness of our presumptions that everything is possible if we simply want it enough			1
so , too , @entity346			0
@entity339 ( left ) and @entity322 regularly left a devastating trail of destruction in their wake @entity193 ( left ) lost his life seven weeks after his fight with @entity353 in 1980 @entity354 ( left ) died during 2003 's @entity355 , while @entity192 lost his life at @entity356 in 1994 @entity357 mourns @entity3 after tragic death there have been four previous deaths in first - class cricket , going back to 1870			1
the fact we can name individuals suggests there is no widespread problem			0
cricket would be greatly safer than do - it - yourself , for instance			0
yet deaths in play , as rare as they may be , hit harder than a tumble from the shed roof			1
athletes are the fittest of the fit , the best of the best			0
we use their commitment and dedication to set our standards , to provide our role models			0
we want our sons and daughters to stand up to bouncers , to ride challenges , to run marathons			0
we want them to be little rippers like @entity3			1
most weeks , he would beat those odds of one against 11			0
to open the innings for his country , @entity3 was plainly very adept at facing up to this unique challenge			1
he had worked all his life to be there			0
his mother and his sister were watching as he prepared to face that last delivery			0
he did n’t know it was coming , neither did they and neither did we			0
still , once the tears subside , the old con will continue			0
a hit to the head , it makes no difference			0
the superhumans can take it			0
did you hear the one about @entity137 ? oh , the stories			0
one day , we ’ll look back again and laugh			0

@entity3 's death required a bouncing ball to be delivered by bowler @entity62 , not exceptionally fast , but slightly too slow
it required @entity3 to marginally misjudge the pace of that ball , or perhaps for it to stick a fraction longer on the surface than usual , causing him to mistime his shot and play early
it suits us all to invest , to pretend , to mythologise this world of hard men , playing the game at the limit of endurance , surviving blows that would fell lesser mortals
@entity3 is the collateral damage of this delusion ; so was @entity192 ; so , too , @entity193 . but we would *n't* have it any other way , even now
