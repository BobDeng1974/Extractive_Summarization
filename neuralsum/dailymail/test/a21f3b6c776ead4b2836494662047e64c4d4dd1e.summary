almost 20,000 years ago a woman was buried deep within a cave on the @entity2 , stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers			1
her grave provides the first evidence of an ancient @entity8 burial in the region and an engraved stone found near her remains appears to have been a makeshift tombstone			1
but the reasons why the female - dubbed ' the @entity15 of @entity16 ' - was buried in such an elaborate tomb , close to an area where her peers would have lived day - to - day , continues to baffle archaeologists			1
the @entity15 's remains ( burial site pictured ) were found in the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25			1
radiocarbon dating suggests she was buried 18,700 years ago			2
when the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material , later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal during the @entity32 period the @entity8 culture occupied much of western @entity33 and spanned from as early as 10,000 bc. @entity8 hunters lived in caves , but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins			1
the @entity15 's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of such a cave called @entity44 in @entity24 between @entity45 and @entity46			1
after discovering a range of individual bones , researchers from the @entity48 led by @entity51 , unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave			1

radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed			2
she was ' robust , relatively tall , [ and ] apparently healthy ' , explained the researchers , and would have lived in the ' cold , open environment of @entity69			0
' herself and her peers would have used stone tools , needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters			1
they would have hunted for ibex and red deer , fished for salmon and ate plants , including some seeds and mushrooms			2
when the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material , later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal			1
a engraved tombstone was found nearby			2
the pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects			2

@entity126 comes from the @entity128 word for ' blood ' and it is often used as a pigment , particularly in cave paintings			0
it is not known why the @entity15 was painted in this way , and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment			0
however , they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual			0
in @entity144 practices , for example , bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods			0
but the fact she was buried within the living quarters of her peers has led the anthropologists to suggest she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects			0
this status is also hinted at due to the presence of a primitive tombstone			0
during the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines			0
among these engravings the researchers spotted a v - shaped motif that they suggest represents a pubic triangle , while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers			0
' could these be indicators of the presence of the woman buried behind the block ? ' said the researchers in their paper ' " the @entity15 of @entity16 "			1

in addition there are lines engraved on the bedrock lower wall and ledge against which part of the corpse had been laid behind the block			0

her body was interred at the rear of the cave ( pictured ) where her peers would have lived and slept @entity126 comes from the @entity128 for ' blood ' and red ochre ( pictured ) is often used as a pigment , particularly in cave paintings			1
it is not known why the @entity15 was painted , and researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment			0
but , they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual the eastern face of the block was additionally ' intensely stained ' with red ochre in the area near where the bones were found , creating a link between the block and body			1
' the ochre may constitute the only demonstrable “ grave offering ” , ' continued the researchers			2
' the burial is one of the most complex features of the @entity8 record in @entity16			1
' the corpse seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall			0
' the head would have been at the northern end of the burial			0
the corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position			0
' because many of the bones are stained with red ochre , it is possible that either the woman 's clothes had been stained with this material - for decoration and / or hide preservation - or her corpse was stained as part of a burial ritual			1
' anthropologists from the @entity48 said : ' the burial is one of the most complex features of the @entity8 record in @entity16			1
the corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position [ and ] seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall ' the cave site of @entity16 is in the @entity269 valley of @entity24 , @entity25 ( marked )			1
its opening is around 850ft ( 260 metres ) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft ( 30 metres ) deep , 52ft ( 16 metres wide ) the cave site of @entity16 is in the @entity269 valley of @entity24 , @entity25			1
its opening is around 850ft ( 260 metres ) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft ( 30 metres ) deep , 52ft ( 16 metres wide )			0
research has shown that the site was occupied from the @entity279 41,000 years ago up to around @entity280			0
during the @entity32 the @entity8 culture occupied much of western @entity33 and spanned from as early as 10,000 bc. @entity8 hunters lived in caves , but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins			1
they predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life			0
in addition to @entity16 , @entity8 sites have been found from @entity295 in the west to as far east as @entity297			1
the @entity16 site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the @entity193 including @entity194 and @entity195 from the @entity300			2
during the excavations , a large engraved rock was found			0
among these engravings the researchers spotted a v - shaped motif that has been said to represent a pubic triangle , suggesting a female was buried nearby			0
the eastern face of the block ( shown on the left of this map ) was also stained ' with red ochre after discovering a series of individual bones ( plotted by red dots ) , researchers unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave			1
radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed in particular , its blood - red colour may have been symbolic of life and death			2
following her burial , the anthropologists said the grave was partially disturbed by a wolf , or similar - sized carnivore			2
they then believe the skeleton was stained a second time and covered again			0
' the scenario that is hypothesised is that the carnivore only minimally disturbed the skeleton , since the bones were unconnected by this time , ' the experts continued			0
' then humans apparently found the exposed tibia and thus the rest of the skeleton			0
they may have removed the cranium and most of the largest bones without totally rearranging the fundamental anatomical order of the former corpse , whose hands may have been placed near her head and feet tucked under her bottom			0
' using detailed mineralogical maps of the region , it is thought the @entity8 people mined the distinctive ochre from an outcrop in the modern - day city of @entity359 , situated around 12 miles ( 20km ) from the cave			1
' although lacking in clear grave offerings , the amounts of red ochre on the bones and in the burial infilling and the apparent association with rock art - both engravings and red ochre on the block against which the corpse 's back had probably rested - the evidence points to a ritualized interment , ' concluded the researchers			1
' but , at the end of the day , we are left with a mystery : who was the “ @entity15 ” of @entity16 and why was she given such special treatment after her death ? '			2

remains of the @entity8 ' red lady ' were uncovered in @entity16 cave
bones were stained with a red ochre made from a haematite crystal
grave is the first burial of this kind found in the @entity2
her identity and why she was buried in an elaborate tomb are *unknown*
