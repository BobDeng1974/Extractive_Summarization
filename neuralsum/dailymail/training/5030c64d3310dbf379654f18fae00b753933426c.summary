considering there is a ban on fans in the @entity4 , there were plenty of bodies in the stadium for tuesday night ’s match			2
around 650 people were inside the ground - club officials , sponsors and media - as well as a gathering of fans outside the stadium endeavouring to make themselves heard			0
in fact , songs went back and forth between the fans and the sponsors , who were enthusiastic enough to suggest they were n’t entirely impartial viewers			0
650 people watched @entity21 vs @entity22 due to the @entity25 club 's stadium ban @entity26 is not afraid to express his opinion , and the former @entity22 midfielder voiced his concerns over @entity31 ’s team selection during the first half			1
‘ i wonder how long @entity31 can justify playing @entity36 , ’ @entity26 tweeted , only for the @entity33 to run the game with a pass completion rate of 96 per cent			0
city boss @entity31 was criticised by @entity37 over his team selection on tuesday night the temperature at the @entity4 was below freezing on tuesday night - @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 were the only @entity22 players not wearing gloves - but not as cold as relations between the two clubs after racist chanting directed at @entity36 during @entity22 ’s last visit to @entity49			1
it was interesting , therefore , that @entity22 ’s chief executive and chairman did n’t make the trip to @entity25 this time			0
@entity43 ( right ) was one of four @entity22 players to not wear gloves during the freezing conditions in @entity25 @entity36 ( second left ) was racially abused the last time these two sides met in @entity25 video lack of concentration cost us - @entity31			1

@entity22 blew a two - goal lead to draw in @entity25 on tuesday night
@entity26 believes @entity31 was *wrong* to start @entity36
650 people watched the match at @entity4 due to @entity21 's stadium ban
relations between the club are still cold after @entity36 was racially abused the last time these two sides met in @entity25
