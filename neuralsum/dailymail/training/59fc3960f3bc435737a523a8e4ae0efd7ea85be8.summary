by @entity1 reporter published : 09:58 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 12:53 est , 29 january 2014 an @entity5 heart surgeon 's claim that a diet of unprocessed foods - not necessarily low - fat foods - can prevent and even reverse heart disease has ignited the @entity10			1
dr. @entity11 has dished the dirt on ' what really causes heart disease ' and he admits prescribing cholesterol - lowering medications , and a low - fat , high - simple carbohydrate diet for two - and - a - half decades was misguided			1
' these recommendations are no longer scientifically or morally defensible , ' he writes in an essay , that has been posted on some 250,000 @entity22 pages since it appeared on a website called tuned body in december			1
truth : dr. @entity11 , pictured , has dished the dirt on ' what really causes heart disease ' and he admits prescribing cholesterol - lowering medications , and a low - fat , high - simple carbohydrate diet for two - and - a - half decades was misguided this idea may not seem all that revolutionary , but hearing @entity11 's vivid imagery about what exactly processed foods actually do to the body would put anyone off their twinkie			1
he explains that this once ' healthy ' diet actively destroys the walls of our blood vessels by causing chronic inflammation			1
this inflammation makes cholesterol stick to the walls , forming the plaques that eventually block them , resulting in a heart attack or stroke			0
' when you spike your blood sugar level several times a day , every day , it is exactly like taking sandpaper to the inside of your delicate blood vessels , ' he writes			0
the former cardiac surgeon , who says he 's ' peered inside thousands upon thousands of arteries ' slams refined carbohydrates as well as the proportion of omega - 6 to omega - 3 fatty acids in the @entity67 diet			2
ouch : @entity11 explains that processed foods , such as @entity69 , actively destroy the walls of our blood vessels by causing chronic inflammation which results in blocked vessels fruits and veggies : ' there is but one answer to quieting inflammation and that is returning to foods closer to their natural state , ' @entity11 writes cure ? @entity11 first made his ' confession ' in his book @entity82 , ipctured he said the heavy load of omega - 6 acids vs omega - 3 in corn and soybean oils - about 15:1 when it should be 3:1 - are too much for the body to process			1
but he insists there 's a silver bullet , and it 's not all that surprising			0
' there is but one answer to quieting inflammation and that is returning to foods closer to their natural state , ' @entity11 writes			0
do n't eat anything your grandmother would n't recognize as food , eat plenty of fruits and vegetables , and lean protein , he recommends			0
he says do n't stress about saturated fats but make sure it 's olive oil , grass - fed meat or full fat dairy that you 're choosing over high - omega - 6 processed foods			1
' since we now know that cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease , the concern about saturated fat is even more absurd today , ' he writes			2
since penning the article , dr. @entity11 has come under fire from the blog @entity121 , which revealed a past fraught with legal issues including having his medical license revoked in 2008			0
the blog 's author dr. @entity124 concluded , ' dr. @entity11 would like you to believe that he has special knowledge of heart disease prevention			2
i do not trust his advice			0
' however , the basic ideas behind what @entity11 writes in the essay have become far more accepted in the treatment of heart disease and other health problems since he first made his ' confession ' in a 2007 book @entity82			2
though regular exercise and reducing stress should be added to such a diet for ultimate health , other experts point out , disputing the ' silver bullet ' claim .			0

he admits prescribing cholesterol - lowering medications , and a low - fat , high - simple carbohydrate diet for two - and - a - half decades was misguided
' these recommendations are no longer scientifically or morally defensible , ' he writes in an essay that has ignited the *internet*
he claims these foods actively destroy the walls of our blood vessels by causing chronic inflammation , which in turn causes heart disease
the cardiac surgeon recommends only eating foods your grandmother , or great - grandmother , would recognize
