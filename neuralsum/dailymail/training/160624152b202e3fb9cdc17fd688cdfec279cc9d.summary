by @entity0 for @entity1 on a freezing night last february , the body of 13 - year - old @entity3 was found lying in the back porch of the church in the tiny , remote village of @entity7 , @entity8			1
she had been battered to death			2
in one of the world ’s most hazardous natural environments , the real dangers for women living in the @entity13 come not from polar bears or cracking ice but from the men they live among			1
@entity3 ’s body lay outside the church in @entity7 for 11 hours after it was found			1
with a population of 559 , @entity7 is just one of 75 remote @entity8 villages with no police force			1
of the 53 communities in the @entity13 @entity36 province of @entity37 , only 28 have @entity39 ( @entity39 ) detachments			2
15 of these are staffed by only two people			2
in the absence of police , according to a report into @entity3 ’s murder in the @entity47 , @entity7 residents were forced to set up a rota to guard the body and patrol the village			2
since the only way out of @entity7 is by plane or boat , the killer was still at large in the community			0
state troopers arrived the following morning			0
it took investigators another few hours to make the journey from @entity60 , 1000 miles away			0
speaking to the @entity47 , @entity61 , chair of @entity7 ’s public safety committee , said , ‘ it can be terrifying			0
when something happens , we have to call 911 to get a state trooper to come			0
isolated : many villages such as this one in @entity8 are extremely isolated and can become cut off during winter distant : this street sign reveals just how far away the remote villages of @entity8 really are ' then , it can take a few hours to a day or two … by the time they get here , sometimes nothing can be done because there ’s no evidence			1
people can just get away with it			0
’ @entity3 ’s mother , @entity79 , added : ‘ people do n’t really fear the law here			0
’ they have reason not to			0
even where it exists , law enforcement often fails to act			0
the @entity86 recently reported the story of a 19 - year - old @entity8 woman raped in the remote fishing village of @entity90			1
after an intruder broke into her home and attacked her , she called the local tribal police and left a message on their voice mail			0
no one ever returned her call			0
her attacker remains in the village			0
the woman reportedly knew of five other women who had been raped by the same man , none of whom reported the crime			1
police can take the view that the prosecution of sexual crimes is too disruptive of community relations			1
a culture of victim - blaming is rampant in tiny , remote villages where , if prosecuted , the perpetrators are likely to be sent to correctional institutions thousands of miles to the south			1
to many @entity13 residents that feels like the 21st century equivalent of transportation			0
in rural settlements across @entity8 and @entity122 , violent crime against women is reaching crisis levels			1
a 2010 poll of nearly 900 @entity8 women found that a shocking 37 per cent had experienced sexual violence			1
according to a survey by the @entity134 reported in the @entity86 , rates of sexual violence in the @entity132 ’s largest state stand at 12 times the national average			1
74 per cent of victims responded to by @entity138 were under 18			1
the situation is so dire that it prompted @entity8 governor @entity140 to launch a state - wide initiative in december 2009 to halt what he called ‘ the epidemic of domestic violence , sexual assault and child sexual abuse ’ in the state			1
hostile : @entity8 's hard winters mean that the snows often cut remote villages off - leaving women vulnerable further east , the picture is the same			1
in the 53 isolated villages of the @entity13 @entity36 province of @entity37 violent crime has risen to nine times the national average			1
reports of domestic violence are six and a half times more common than in the south			1
the @entity163 women ’s group @entity164 reported that 52 per cent of women in @entity37 have suffered physical violence , and 27 per cent have been forced into sexual activity			1
in this frozen , remote zone these statistics remain the tip of the iceberg			0
the @entity36 government estimates that only 29 per cent of domestic abuse in @entity37 is ever reported			1
a recent @entity36 @entity175 report notes : ' it is truly indeed a war zone in some households , with no protection for the most vulnerable			0
' the isolation of most @entity13 communities makes fear of reprisals a real issue in reporting abuse			2
most victims of rape in the @entity13 not only know their attackers , they are forced to live side by side with them			2
beautiful : the @entity13 's stunning scenery conceals high rates of alcoholism and domestic violence dangerous : some think they can do as they please in the wilderness so the area has high levels of sex abuse speaking to @entity36 - based news network @entity207 , @entity203 of @entity205 women ’s shelter in @entity206 , the @entity37 capital , insisted that ' people do n’t want to report due to fear			1
they ’re afraid of community members			0
' even if a woman does report a sexual assault , there ’s very often no refuge or safe house to escape to			2
only seven of the 53 communities in @entity37 have shelters			0
the nearest is often hundreds of miles away			0
there are no roads out			0
in @entity122 , 15 per cent of homes do n’t even have a phone			2
a plane ticket averages c $ 1000 ( £ 500 )			0
as associate attorney general @entity227 told the @entity47 , ' where are you supposed to go ? you have nowhere to go			0
' the reasons for this epidemic of violence are complex			2
economic deprivation , custom and the often bewildering speed of social change all play a part			0
native custom dictates that sexual violence is rarely talked about			1
as a result , abuse gets passed down between generations			2
trafficking : many young girls are trafficked south by their parents while others suffer appalling abuse research : @entity246 has spent years researching the lives of people in @entity8 and northern @entity122 overcrowding , homelessness , and resettlement have deprived men of their traditional roles			1
@entity13 women are consistently out - performing men in education and employment , leading to resentment and , among the men , feelings of worthlessness and rage			2
soaring rates of alcohol and substance abuse do n’t help			1
the @entity39 informally estimates that alcohol is responsible for 95 per cent of all family violence			1
in a part of the world where , according to a study by the @entity271 , 25 per cent of young people in @entity37 have alcohol addiction issues , alcohol and drugs are often used as bait by transient outsiders eager to sexually exploit the vulnerable			1
when a mine opened at @entity279 in @entity122 police reported an increase in sex crimes of 1400 per cent			2
the sudden availability of drugs and moonshine , along with jealousies about jobs and money , led to a rise in domestic violence of 1200 per cent			1
there are stories of young girls being trafficked to the south , or even sold by parents for as much as c $ 20,000			0
right now , mines like that at @entity279 are opening weekly			0
across the @entity13 , women are beginning to speak out , in rallies and village meetings but , in the land of ice , it will take a sea change before young women like @entity3 can feel even moderately safe or protected by the law			2
as @entity306 , @entity246 writes the @entity308 series of @entity13 mysteries			0
