a @entity1 hardliner who says adulterers should be stoned to death and that gay men and fornicators should be lashed 100 times has set up an @entity8 school that has received almost £ 1million of taxpayers ’ money			1
@entity11 , one of @entity13 ’s most prominent @entity8 firebrands – who also heads a charity branded a ‘ terrorist ’ organisation by the @entity17 – is the founder and chairman of trustees of the @entity21 school in @entity22 , which teaches 250 boys and girls aged between three and 11			1
he has vilified homosexuals as paedophiles and said a man can take on a second wife if his first fails to satisfy him sexually			1
mr @entity11 has published his views in a book on @entity8 , which he claims has sold more than 50,000 copies in @entity13			1
a teacher at the @entity21 primary school in @entity22 the preacher is the founder of another controversial organisation called the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , whose leader has been accused of orchestrating a plot in @entity39 called ‘ @entity40 ’ in which @entity8 extremists have allegedly taken over 25 state schools in the city			1
last night it was reported that six @entity39 , schools implicated in the plot will be placed in ‘ special measures ’ by inspectors , meaning their leadership team could be removed			2
@entity51 is also said to be taking action at a further nine schools where the attempted takeover is less advanced			2
that news came as campaigners called for an investigation by the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) to be expanded to mr @entity11 and his @entity22 school			1
@entity60 , of anti-extremist think - tank the @entity62 , said : ‘ i would like to see the investigation widened to other cities as well as @entity39 , and maybe look at private schools in case the welfare of children is at risk			0
‘ there should be an investigation into @entity21 to see what children are being taught			0
’ @entity11 , chairman of @entity21 school said that all adulterers should be stoned to death and fornication should be punished with 100 lashes mr @entity11 , 57 , established the private school in 1998			1
he runs it with his wife @entity81 , 53			1
the school practises segregated seating for boys and girls from aged seven and does not allow music or dance lessons as they are deemed un-islamic			1
female teachers teach with their faces covered with a veil , according to images on the school ’s website			2
the school , which charges fees of up to £ 1,800 per year , has received £ 747,360 from the @entity96 in @entity22 as an early years grant for teaching three to five - year - olds since 2007			1
the preacher is the author of a book called what does @entity101 ? , which spells out his vision of ‘ true @entity8 ’			0
in it he advocates the killing of adulterers by stoning			0
the book says : ‘ any act that destabilises marriage will also destabilise society			0
hence the @entity8 punishments for such acts are severe … married men and women found guilty of adultery are to be stoned to death			0
’ the book also advocates 100 lashes for fornication and sodomy with both men and women , and condemns homosexuality as a ‘ grave sin ’			1
mr @entity11 says in the book : ‘ @entity8 , like most other major faiths of the world , categorically forbids homosexual practices ( sexual relations between two men or between two women ) , regarding them as a great sin			1
in a society under @entity8 law , such would be severely punished			2
’ he then compares homosexuals to paedophiles or those who commit incest			0
the book says : ‘ if people have such desires [ homosexuality ] , they should keep them to themselves , and control their desires to avoid forbidden practices			0
‘ the advice would be the same as , say , to someone who had sexual desires for minors or for close family : that having the desires does not legitimise realising them			0
’ the book also argues that men and women are not equal , and men have a right to assume leadership over women			0
‘ @entity8 recognises the leadership of men over women , but it does not recognise the domination of one over the other			0
’ he adds : ‘ if a woman is unable to satisfy the sexual or other needs of her husband he may consider taking another wife , rather than the common @entity169 practice of secretly taking a mistress			2
’ mr @entity11 has in the past said that ‘ political @entity172 is a threat to world peace ’ and has objected to the setting up of @entity175			1
he is also the chairman of a charity called @entity178 , which the @entity179 has designated a ‘ global terrorist entity ’ due to accusations it has raised money for the @entity183 terror group @entity182			2
however , a report by the @entity186 last year found no evidence that it had done so			0
when @entity188 contacted mr @entity11 , he said he still ‘ endorses ’ what he wrote in the book			1
‘ islamic law states that homosexuals should be lashed and adulterers should be stoned			0
i believe that is correct if it is an @entity8 state			0
i am a @entity1 and if i lived in an @entity8 state then i would live by what i wrote in my book			0
but i am in this country and follow its law , ’ he said			0
education secretary @entity201 has appointed the @entity203 ’s former counter-terrorism chief , @entity202 , to head an investigation into the alleged @entity40 plot			0
by @entity206 a state - funded @entity8 school was at the centre of controversy last night over claims that a poster banning listening to music appeared on its official noticeboard			1
the poster , alleged to have been put up at the @entity216 in @entity22 , warned that pupils ‘ must stay away from evil acts such as music and encourage others to do the same too ’			1
a photo of the poster , which is claimed to have been taken by a concerned supply teacher inside the school , has appeared on @entity225			2
a @entity225 post branding music as ' sinful ' is being investigated by council chiefs in @entity22 the poster ’s text quoted an apparent saying of the @entity232 , which said : ‘ music sows hypocrisy in the heart like water causes seeds to grow in soil			1
’ it also warned : ‘ music is a tool of @entity248 [ @entity249 ] ’ , adding : ‘ the messages of today ’s music follow a general theme of love , drugs and freedom			0
’ @entity22 assistant mayor @entity250 said : ‘ @entity252 officers will be visiting the school after @entity254 to discuss the issue with the headteacher and governors			1
’ @entity258 , a faith academy once accused of flouting the @entity260 by insisting boys and girls were segregated and taught by a member of the same sex , has received £ 18 million of state funding			1
its chairman of governors , @entity266 , said : ‘ this poster has not existed in our premises			2
i do n’t know who dreamt this hoax up			0
’ @entity273 of @entity274 , a group set up to promote @entity1 engagement with @entity13 society , said music prohibitions in the @entity8 faith related to some disputed sayings attributed to @entity232 after his death , adding : ‘ it would be bizarre if a state - funded school would not give music its due importance in the curriculum			2
’ the supply teacher said to have taken the photo declined to comment .			0

fees at the school where boys and girls are segregated are £ 1,800
