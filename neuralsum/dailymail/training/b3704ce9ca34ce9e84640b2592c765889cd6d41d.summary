the @entity0 and @entity1 may have been playing for first place in the @entity3 on thursday evening , but for a few minutes between the first and second quarter of the game , that was the last thing on the mind of any players on the field of fans in the stands			2
that was when the @entity0 presented a check for $ 1.3million to the @entity13 in @entity14 for pediatric cancer treatment and research , money raised from the sale of @entity20 jerseys , the team 's defensive tackle whose young daughter @entity23 was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in june			1
the team also honored @entity23 during this ceremony as well , and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game - and see her father play			1
it has been a whirlwind few weeks for @entity23 , who hopped on a flight from @entity55 to travel to @entity14 for thursday 's game , as the young girl also became a bit of a music video star			2
not knowing @entity23 was the daughter of @entity39 , she was one of the young children fighting cancer who was selected by @entity60 to be featured in a fundraising effort she started that featured the children singing a mashup of @entity66 's @entity65 and @entity67 , called @entity68			0
brave girl : @entity23 flew in from @entity55 , where she is receiving treatment , for the game inspiration : the $ 1.3million that was donated was all raised from the sale of @entity20 jerseys fan support : fans ( right ) also showed their support for @entity23 and her dad @entity78 ) to date , the video has been viewed over one million times			1
the @entity0 ( 5 - 2 - 1 ) helped still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in @entity55			0
they kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he 'd keep his medical coverage			0
happy girl : @entity23 and @entity39 could be seen looking at one another throughout the game ( above ) real leader : @entity93 snapped a photo with the @entity0 cheerleaders before the game big day : the young girl also wore her dad 's jersey , but with a little bling ‘ it 's going to be added motivation just knowing my daughter is watching me , ’ still said prior to thursday night in an interview with @entity101			1
‘ i want her to be able to hear how the crowd cheers that loud whenever i make a tackle , so i 'm going to go out there and do whatever i can to put a smile on her face			0
’ sadly , thought not that it mattered to @entity23 at all , the @entity0 did not come out on top , losing to the @entity1 24 to 3 .			0

@entity23 , who has stage 4 @entity118 , was able to watch her dad @entity39 , a tackle for the @entity0 , play for the first time thursday
@entity23 was also honored during the game , and $ 1.3million was donated by the team to the @entity13 in @entity14 for pediatric cancer treatment and research
