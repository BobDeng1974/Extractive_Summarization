@entity0 has hit out at a journalist who dared ask a question about the fraud allegations against him , telling him to ‘ think ’ for himself			1
mr @entity0 attacked @entity6 correspondent @entity5 while speaking at a @entity8 lunch in @entity9 after @entity5 tried to quiz him about a ‘ fraudulent and dishonest payments ’ court case he is embroiled in			1
the 60 - year - old businessman is accused of misusing $ 12 million from two @entity14 - owned companies and the case is currently before the @entity16			0
mr @entity0 refused to allow mr @entity5 to ask questions shouting ‘ no , no , no ’			1
‘ why do n’t you try to be an independent journalist ? , ’ he blasted			1
i 'm not going to take that rubbish , ’ he fumed			0
' have some guts to @entity27 , do n’t do what he tells you from @entity30 ... stand up and be a journalist			2
do n’t read off that , think off your own brain and think of a question , ' he raged			2
the @entity35 attacked the @entity6 newspaper and its cartoons as a ‘ national disgrace to journalism ’			2
a journalist at @entity41 , @entity42 , stuck up for @entity5 and fired back : ' mr @entity0 are you so convinced that @entity44 controls the views of all his journalists because you as a billionaire control the views of all your remaining senators ? ' mr @entity0 did not back down and replied : ' i do n't control anyone ’s views			1
individual citizens can think how they wish but certainly @entity44 it would seem does , as he 's sacked so many people in this country			0
’ the @entity35 attacked the @entity6 newspaper and its cartoons @entity0 's tirade did not stop when another journalist stuck up for @entity5 the mining giant went on : ' 500 people have been sacked from @entity61 in @entity62 over the last three years , if you go to the annual reports of @entity65 and have a look at that			1
the @entity68 has n't made a profit for over 50 years so you 've got to ask what its economic rationale for being there			0
‘ the editor of the @entity76 paper was sacked last election , we had @entity65 editors coming from @entity30 telling them what they could write and we had the cartoons of @entity81 and @entity82 and people being demeaned as individuals rather than attacking their policies			0
‘ as i said it makes no sense to attack individuals we need to attack the ideas to get the right policies for the country			0
' mr @entity0 became irate after he was asked about his fraud case @entity93 responded : ' why are you attacking journalists doing their job ? this is a journalist club he was asking a question			1
' mr @entity0 said he could not answer @entity5 ’s question because it was about an active court case			1
' i ca n't answer questions on that because the matter is before the court and it would be contempt of court			0
now that 's an answer and to persist with questions once you know that is really a disrespect for the court and fairness , and that 's what it 's about			0
‘ he raised serious allegations which are just allegations which have been raised before for six months by @entity65 papers and lead nowhere			2
