by @entity0 published : 04:57 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 06:31 est , 12 february 2013 long battle : former school dinner lady @entity2 has won the right to compensation two years after winning a claim for wrongful dismissal a school dinner lady who was sacked after telling a seven - year - old girl 's parents about a ' brutal ' bullying incident has won her two - year battle to get compensation for wrongful dismissal			1
@entity2 , 61 , was devastated when she was suspended from @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , after she inadvertently told a pupil 's parents about the bullying in june 2009			1
mrs @entity2 spoke to the press about her shock at her suspension and was then sacked in september 2009 by the headteacher for ' breach of confidentiality '			1
mrs @entity2 then began her campaign for justice			2
as the @entity29 reported at the time , mrs @entity2 - who supervised pupils ' games at lunchtime - had gone to the aid of a seven - year - old girl who had been tied to a fence and whipped with a skipping rope by four children			1
when mrs @entity2 later bumped into the schoolgirl ’s parents at a @entity38 meeting , she assumed they had been told and asked how she was – only to discover they had been informed she had suffered a ‘ minor accident ’			2
the girl — who had rope burns on her wrist and red welts on her thigh — had been sent home with a note for her parents stating only that she had been hurt in a ' skipping rope incident '			1
an employment tribunal in january 2011 found mrs @entity2 had been unfairly dismissed but her compensation was cut at a second hearing because she had spoken to the press about her ordeal			1
however , an employment appeal tribunal has found the decision was wrong			2
she will get at least £ 600 , but could get more pending a further hearing			2
dismissal : @entity2 was sacked from @entity14 , in @entity16 , after telling a pupil 's parents about a bullying incident in june 2009 constant reminder : @entity2 , who worked at the school for seven years , can see the playing fields from the end of her garden mrs @entity2 , from @entity66 , said : ' it has been a horrible ordeal but i feel a step closer to justice			1
' i was never doing it for the money , i was doing it because i believe what i did was right			0
' i was getting blamed for doing something i truly believed was right			0
' it the principle i was fighting for , it was never about the money , although i am happy about the outcome now			0
' mrs @entity2 now works as a cleaner around the village but misses dealing with children			2
mrs @entity2 was suspended by the school 's headteacher @entity84 , pictured , before being dismissed for ' breach of confidentiality ' she said : ' i loved that job , i would definitely still be doing it if this has not happened			2
' it is a real rollercoaster ride , one minute you 're up and the next you 're down			0
' i am delighted with the outcome			0
' mrs @entity2 was initially suspended by @entity84 , headteacher at the primary school in july 2009 , and was fired in september after speaking to the press about her ordeal			2
a statement from @entity14 , in @entity98 , said : ' the employment appeal tribunal upheld mrs @entity2 's appeal into her compensation payout following dismissal from @entity14			1
' it does not change the outcome of the overall case but there may need to be a further liabilities hearing at an employment tribunal to reassess the amount originally awarded			0
' speaking after she first won her case for unfair dismissal in 2011 , mrs @entity2 told of her distress over the ordeal			1
she said : ' i lost weight and my hair thinned because of the stress			0
' the worst part was not being at the school any more			0
not because of the money – but because of the job itself			0
i love kids and to be taken away from them like i was some sort of criminal was heartbreaking			0
' i could n’t eat , i could n’t sleep , i lost weight , i snapped at people , i suffered high blood pressure , but now i feel vindicated and can hold my head up high again			0
' i know i could n’t have lived with myself having seen what i saw and keeping quiet			0
another hurdle : mrs @entity2 won her employment tribunal for wrongful dismissal in 2011 but had her compensation cut for speaking to the press about her ordeal ' it was important for me to fight for my job , even though i earned only £ 125 a month , because i thought i was right			1
' what mother would n’t want to know that their child had been tied up and whipped with a skipping rope ? ’ @entity143 , general secretary of public sector @entity144 , said : ' @entity2 has been put through a terrible ordeal by the school and lost a job she truly loved			1
' the value of someone being free to speak out against injustice must be upheld and this decision by the employment appeal tribunal strengthens and clarifies this important principle			0
' victory : two years after winning her wrongful dismissal claim , mrs @entity2 has had the decision to cut her compensation overturned			1
