fear of a trip to the doctors and a jab of a needle could be a thing of the past , with scientists developing a world - first needless injection to dispense vaccines			1
the study has developed a method in which people can inhale a vaccine through a nebuliser device to be safeguarded against potential infections			1
researchers from @entity17 and @entity18 have successfully turned a liquid vaccination into an aerosol form against the flu through sound waves			1
world - first platform for inhaled vaccines could see the end of needles when electricity is applied to the matchbox - sized device , it interacts with the medication to agitate a small and powerful wave , which forms a fine mist of particles			1
the timing of the measures spins so fast that the dna molecules in solutions have no time to stretch or cause damage to their structure			0
lead researcher dr @entity41 told @entity42 that the new development hopes to influence more people to get their vaccinations in the future			0
@entity48 scientists have successfully trialled an aerosol form against flu dr @entity41 said the development holds a lot of promise for a replacement to vaccine injections ‘ one of the biggest problems with vaccinations is people tend to avoid getting needles because they do n’t want to go through with it , ’ she said			1
‘ we ’re hoping that the inhale method will give people an alternative option and it ’ll be a complimentary treatment as it ’s a non-invasive method as oppose to needles			2
the nebulizer works as droplets containing the vaccine , which are inhaled and deposited on the surfaces of the lungs			1
after the dna of the vaccine is introduced into a person 's cells , those cells produce ‘ antigen ’ proteins			2
the immune system is trained to attack the disease by producing antibodies against these antigen proteins			0
‘ people can prescribe the medication and purchase it over the counter , which means they can do the inhaling vaccination in their own time at home and avoid queuing up at the doctors , ' dr @entity41 told @entity42			2
the nebulizer works as droplets containing the vaccine , which are inhaled and deposited on surfaces of lungs dr @entity41 said the development holds a lot of promise for a replacement to vaccine injections which are associated with safety concerns in developing countries , requiring expensive and specialised handling , refrigeration , and staff training that many places in the world can not afford			1
‘ current vaccines often induce inflammation , causing pain , requiring monitoring by health care workers and resulting in peoples ' unwillingness to seek vaccination			0
‘ we sought to re-engineer vaccine administration with our respiratory nebuliser for plasmid dna vaccine delivery			0
a dna - based vaccine can be produced in as little as two weeks , a critically important improvement in the face of a pandemic			2
‘ there is huge potential of this work to be used for mass vaccination programs especially in the developing countries with limited resources			0
’ researchers have developed a potential alternative for vaccinations and successfully trialling a method in which people can inhale vaccine to be safeguarded against potential infections the nebulizer technology can be made portable and only requires batteries for operation but will take five to 10 minutes to vaccinate as oppose to a one minute needle jab at the doctors			1
‘ if the technology picks up and can be mass produced with enough funding , it can be very affordable and could cost just under five dollars			0
‘ they ’re designed to be reused and keep the delivery of vaccine safe for people , ' she said			0
‘ but in terms of prototypes , we are still five to 10 years away from the market but once the development is completed , this is the future to inhaling any amount of influenza in one shot			0
’ the device is especially suitable for lung - related afflictions such as influenza , and , potentially for treatment of systemic diseases such as @entity161 with entirely new dna vaccines			1
the research was done in collaboration with professor @entity165 , professor @entity166 , professor @entity167 , dr. @entity168 , professor @entity170 dr. @entity169 , dr. @entity171 , dr. @entity172 , dr. @entity173 , dr. @entity174 and associate professor @entity175 .			0
