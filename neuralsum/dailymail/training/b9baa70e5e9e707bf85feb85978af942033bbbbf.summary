by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 26 november 2013 @entity2 : 08:02 est , 26 november 2013 @entity3 failed to name the @entity5 winners sports minister @entity3 was left humiliated after she failed to get a single question right in a basic quiz – on sport			1
the @entity16 mp did not know the name of the current @entity12 women ’s champion			2
she also scored an own - goal by not knowing who won this year ’s @entity5			1
mrs @entity3 bungled her way through five questions and got every answer wrong , even when she tried to cheat by seeking help from an adviser			1
she was quizzed in a toe - curling exchange with @entity28			2
asked who won the women ’s title at @entity12 , she replied : ‘ it ’s not one of us			0
‘ i know @entity35 did it for us , which is absolutely fantastic and that ’s the important thing			0
’ the correct answer was @entity6 of @entity40			0
next she was asked who the @entity5 holders were			1
a slightly anxious - looking mrs @entity3 said : ‘ come on , help , ’ before replying : ‘ @entity43 because it ’s my favourite club			1
’ most football fans would know if their team had won such a coveted trophy			0
the correct answer was @entity4			0
mrs @entity3 did not even attempt to name the @entity8 captain ( @entity9 ) simply replying : ‘ what about hockey ? who won the women 's title at @entity12 ? which team currently holds the @entity5 ? who is the captain of the @entity8 team ? when did @entity57 [ her constituency ] leave the football league ? which paralympian won the most gold medals at @entity61 ? scroll down for the answers perhaps taking pity on her , the presenter asked her when the football team in her constituency , @entity57 , had left the football league			1
mrs @entity3 conceded : ‘ these are hard questions ’ before adding ‘ last year ’			1
the correct answer was 1992			0
finally , she was asked which paralympian had won the most gold medals at @entity61			0
an adviser whispered the answer which mrs @entity3 parroted : @entity73			1
but the correct answer was @entity75 swimmer @entity74			0
afterwards mrs @entity3 said : ‘ i was n’t told there was going to be a quiz thrown in at the end of an interview			1
if i ’d known i would have done some proper revision			0
‘ my sports pub quiz knowledge may not be encyclopaedic but i completely understand the positive impact that participating in sport has on people ’s lives			2
’ last month , the mp for @entity87 and the @entity88 said that sport was in her dna shortly after being promoted to sports minister			0
she had widely been tipped for the sack in the reshuffle			0
she later became under - 16 judo champion in the north of @entity8 and southern @entity118			1
mrs @entity3 is not the only sports minister to be left floundering after being ambushed in a quiz			1
@entity123 ’s @entity122 suffered a similar fate in 2001 , when the @entity126 ’s @entity125 asked him a string of questions about sport			2
mr @entity122 did not know that @entity130 was the then captain of the @entity132 rugby team , could not name a single jockey riding in that week ’s @entity134 and could not identify three of the four semi-finalists at the @entity137 tennis tournament			2
he made a gallant stab at naming @entity8 ’s cricket coach , declaring he was ‘ the @entity75 ’ ... but @entity140 was actually from @entity141			2
@entity74 ( @entity143 swimmer )			0

@entity3 was given a *surprise* quiz during an interview
failed to get any of the five questions right
could *n't* name @entity5 winners or @entity8 rugby captain
