an offshoot of the @entity3 's @entity2 insurgency has begun operating on southern @entity4 , less than three months after @entity6 combat troops withdrew from the region			2
a man identified as mullah @entity9 was actively recruiting fighters for the groups , flying black flags and , according to some sources , even battling @entity15 militants			1
local sources said @entity9 , a former @entity17 prisoner , had set up his base in @entity20 province and was offering good wages to anyone willing to fight for the @entity2			2

there is now an @entity33 operating in @entity4 general @entity34 , the deputy commander of the @entity4 army 's 215 corps , said residents of a number of districts in @entity20 have said @entity9 's representatives are fanning out to recruit people			0
' a number of tribal leaders , jihadi commanders and some ulema ( religious council members ) and other people have contacted me to tell me that @entity49 had contacted them and invited them to join him , ' gen @entity34 said			1
but he said the @entity15 , which is active across @entity20 , has warned people not to contact @entity9			1
@entity55 has promised to lobby @entity56 for the release of the last @entity6 resident held at @entity17 when he visits @entity59 this week , the detainee 's lawyer said			0
@entity60 , a @entity61 who is married to a @entity62 , has not been charged with any crime and was cleared for release in 2007 from the @entity66 naval base in @entity67			0
all @entity6 nationals and citizens have been released from the detention camp			0
@entity56 has pledged to close @entity17 , opened in 2002 to house suspected militants , but faces obstacles from @entity73			1
according to rights group @entity74 , @entity60 moved to @entity6 in 1996 and was in @entity4 doing voluntary work for an @entity33 charity when he was captured by @entity78 forces in 2001 and handed to the @entity66 military			0
@entity60 's lawyer , @entity80 , said mr @entity55 had written to him in the last week to say he would raise the case with @entity56			0
mr @entity80 said that was welcome but not enough			0
' he has said this before and little has come of it			0
rather than just raising @entity60 's case , mr @entity55 must come back from @entity59 with a concrete date for @entity60 's return home to @entity88 , ' said @entity80 , director of the charity reprieve			0
' people are saying that he has raised black flags and even has tried to bring down white @entity15 flags in some areas , ' said @entity94 , a tribal leader in @entity96 district , where @entity6 troops once patrolled			1
' there are reports that 19 or 20 people have been killed ' in fighting between the @entity15 and the is group , he added			1
@entity102 , who was @entity96 district governor until last month , told the @entity103 that @entity9 was believed to be moving back and forth to @entity104 and @entity105 via @entity106			2
' he is telling people that his leader is in @entity104 and that they have some activities in some parts of @entity4 , ' mr @entity102 said			2
@entity20 provincial council head @entity111 told the @entity103 that @entity9 's @entity2 cell was offering wages of $ 500 ( Â£ 330 ) a month to tempt @entity15 fighters to switch sides			1
tensions between the established militant group and the new pretender had reportedly turned deadly on at least one occasion , including a week ago when five or six people were killed when a gunfight broke out between @entity9 's followers and those of mullah @entity124 , the @entity15 commander in northern @entity20			1
the violence comes less than three months after the withdrawal of @entity6 combat troops from the country , where they had been waging war against the @entity15 for 13 years			1
a total of 453 @entity6 forces personnel or @entity133 civilians died while serving in @entity4 since the start of operations in october 2001			0
more than 2,200 members of the @entity66 military have died			0
estimates of the number of @entity15 fighters killed are sketchy , but range from 25,000 to 40,000			1
the war also resulted in the deaths of an estimated 18,000 to 20,000 @entity4 civilians			0
occupation : the establishment of the @entity2 comes less than three months after the withdrawal of @entity6 combat troops from @entity4 , where they had been waging war against the @entity15 for 13 years @entity9 was a corps commander during the @entity15 's 1996 - 2001 rule of @entity4 , according to @entity148 , governor of @entity150 province , who says he is related to @entity9 but has not seen him for almost 20 years			1
both gen @entity34 and @entity152 said @entity9 was apprehended after the fall of the @entity15 in the @entity66 - led invasion of @entity4 and was detained for years at @entity17			1
they suggested @entity9 may have fallen out with @entity15 leaders after spending time in the @entity158 city of @entity159 , where @entity4 officials and analysts believe senior @entity15 leaders are based			1
a video released on saturday purports to show militants from both @entity4 and @entity158 pledging support to @entity2			1
but @entity166 said the group was not likely to gain traction with ordinary @entity4			0
' people who want to fight in @entity4 just create new names - one day they are wearing white clothes ( of the @entity15 ) and the next day they have black clothes and call themselves @entity173 , but they are the same people , ' he said , using the @entity176 acronym for the @entity2			1
in @entity59 , @entity178 spokeswoman @entity177 said the @entity66 has noted the ' rhetorical message of support ' for @entity2 by some in @entity4			0
' we continue to watch for signs that these statements could amount to something more than just rhetorical support , ' she said			0
' that does n't mean it 's unimportant			0
' analysts say most claims of allegiance to is in @entity4 have been motivated by opportunism and that a new jihadist outfit would find it difficult to establish a presence where there are already long - established militant groups with tribal links			2
the @entity15 have confined their insurgency to @entity4 , and do not espouse the pan-islamic model of jihad embraced by the @entity2 .			2
