you can find pretty much anything to buy on @entity2 , from cast - off clothing to entire homes and perhaps soon , @entity6 's severed finger			1
the former baseball star , and admitted doper , tweeted monday night that he plans to list his left middle finger on @entity2 , which he accidentally shot off last month while cleaning a handgun			1
doctors at first reattached the finger after the october 29 accident , but the limb fell off while the 50 - year - old retired slugger was playing poker last week and now appears to be unusable			1
on monday , he tweeted about selling it on @entity2 ' i will soon put the finger that fell off in the poker tournament on @entity2 for sale , ' @entity6 tweeted monday night			1
' the @entity2 ad will read slightly used middle finger with 462 home runs could be used as a stirring straw for drinks , ' he joked			1
@entity34 went on to offer the finger as a package deal , with the 45 - caliber @entity38 gun that shot it off on october 29			1
however , it 's almost certain that @entity6 wo n't follow through with the plan , since @entity2 's policies do not allow the sell of firearms or human remains unless they are ' items containing human scalp hair , and skulls and skeletons intended for medical use			1

' @entity6 explained the bullet only narrowly missed his fiance , swimwear model @entity66 , who was standing nearby			2
she quickly ran to his aid			0
' i was telling @entity6 not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out , ' @entity66 told @entity53			2
@entity66 wrapped his hand in a towel and called 911			0
' i ’m just glad nothing happened to her ( @entity66 ) , ' @entity6 said			2
