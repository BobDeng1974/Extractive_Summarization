last week , @entity0 claimed losing @entity1 for saturday 's trip to @entity3 would be ' no problem '			0
unfortunately for the @entity8 faithful , their side fell to a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity10 without the suspended @entity11 , who had been one of seven ever - presents in the @entity13 for the @entity14 so far this season			1
despite suffering their first loss of the season , @entity0 's side still sit three points clear at the top of the table , proving that consistent selection can be key with six players having started in each of @entity8 's 15 games so far			0
six of the @entity8 first team have started every @entity13 game so far this season @entity1 was suspended for @entity8 's 2 - 1 win against @entity3 on saturday table continues below @entity30 's @entity29 are the only other team to rival @entity8 's ever - present selection , with the @entity33 boss also picking the same six players to start in each of his team 's 14 outings			1
and it 's no coincidence that these two teams sit first and fourth in the @entity13 as we head into the busy @entity41 period			0
in his second spell as @entity14 boss , @entity0 looks intent on creating a solid spine , similar to the one that brought him so much success during his time in charge 10 years ago			0
this time , rather than @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , it 's @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity52 , @entity58 and @entity59 , whenever the @entity61 striker is available			0
@entity8 would have also played the same backline in each game if it was n't for @entity65 's red card against @entity66 which saw @entity67 deputise at @entity3			2
@entity57 ( left ) , @entity68 ( centre ) and @entity52 have started all of @entity8 's 15 @entity13 games at @entity73 , @entity72 would no doubt have loved to select the same set of players each week , but the @entity33 boss has had to deal with a number of injuries to key players meaning only @entity79 has started each game			1
@entity8 's @entity13 title rivals @entity81 do not feature in the ever - present list as none of the squad have started in each of their 15 games			1
the fact that @entity88 's side still sit in second place , just three points behind leaders @entity8 , is testament to the strength in depth that @entity81 boss has at his disposal			0
@entity96 also fail to feature in the list while @entity97 can only claim to have @entity98 as their ever - present in goal			2
@entity79 is the only @entity73 player to feature in every @entity13 game for the club @entity102 has started every game during his debut season for @entity29 @entity88 has rotated his squad this season , meaning @entity81 do n't have an ever - present @entity107 unsure on seriousness of @entity110 injury			1

@entity112 had played in all @entity114 game before *missing* trip to @entity3 through suspension
@entity8 suffered a 2 - 1 defeat against @entity3 at @entity10
six @entity14 players have featured in every @entity13 match
@entity30 also has six @entity29 ever - presents
only @entity79 has featured in every @entity73 match
@entity96 and @entity81 are without at least one ever - present
