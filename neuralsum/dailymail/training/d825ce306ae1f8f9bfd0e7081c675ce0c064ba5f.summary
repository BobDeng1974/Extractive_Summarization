by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 10:40 est , 9 october 2013 as the @entity3 government shutdown enters its ninth day the closure is threatening to leave @entity3 ’s craft brewers nursing a serious hangover			1
while stores across the country will continue to stock a range of beers and ales on their shelves , the shutdown has closed an obscure agency , which quietly approves new breweries , recipes and labels			1
its closure could halt the rapidly growing craft industry in its tracks , creating huge delays for customers who expect a constant supply of inventive and seasonal beers			1
he claims the federal closure will cost him $ 8,000 a month the federal government shutdown began on october 1 after a group of @entity37 @entity36 lawmakers blocked a budget deal in a last - ditch effort to stop funding for president @entity42 ’s health care law			1
@entity27 is trying to open a craft brewery in @entity29 in december			1
his application to include a tasting room is now on hold , as are his plans to file paperwork for four new labels over the coming weeks			1
he risks losing around $ 8,000 for every month his opening is delayed			1
‘ my dream , this is six years in the making , is to open this brewery , ’ he said			2
‘ i 've been working so hard , and i find all these great investors			2
and now i ca n't get started because people are fighting over this or that in @entity57			2
‘ this is something people do n't mess around with			2
even in a bad economy , people drink beer			2
’ he said politicians do not seem to care how much damage they are causing			2
‘ for them it ’s just another day , ' he added			0
' they are still getting paid , but i ’m losing $ 8,000 a month			1
’ shut : the closure of @entity68 means mr @entity27 's application to open his new brewery , to include a tasting room , is now on hold as are plans to file paperwork for four new brews concerned : @entity76 , spokesman for @entity77 in @entity29 , said : ' right now , it 's only been a week so it 's not too bad			1
two weeks , three weeks is when we 're really going to start sweating here			1
' the @entity68 ( @entity81 ) is a little - known arm of the @entity83			1
while the agency will continue to process taxes from existing permit holders during the shutdown , applications for anything new are in limbo			1
what will happen during the shutdown ? all non-essential government services close and their staff are put on unpaid leave			1
more than 80 per cent of staff at bodies such as @entity98 and the @entity99 will be ' furloughed ' , but courts , the military and veterans ' affairs will remain functioning almost as normal			0
national parks and government - funded museums such as the @entity107 will be closed			1
@entity109 pension payments and the ' @entity111 ' health reforms will not be affected , because they are funded separately			0
what is the economic effect ? the shutdown is predicted to cost the @entity3 economy more than $ 1billion a day , according to @entity116 , thanks to the drop in output caused by federal workers staying at home , and the loss of @entity124 should people outside the @entity3 care ? @entity126 applications are expected to be delayed because consulate staff will not be paid , while officials currently involved in international trade negotiations will have to break off from talks			1
stock markets around the world fell on news of the shutdown			1
even more worryingly , the deadlock in @entity57 makes it less likely that politicians will be able to strike a deal to raise the @entity3 debt ceiling later this month - if the world 's biggest economy is forced to default on its debts , the world could be plunged into the worst economic crisis since the collapse of @entity146			1
@entity147 , director of the @entity148 , which represents more than 1,900 @entity3 breweries , said : ‘ one could think of this shutdown as basically stopping business indefinitely for anyone who did n't have certain paperwork in place back in mid-august			1
’ a woman who answered the phone on october 2 at @entity81 ’s headquarters in @entity57 abruptly hung up on @entity158 after explaining the government was shutdown			1
assistant administrator @entity161 did not respond to telephone or email messages			0
a message on the bureau ’s website warns : ‘ due to the government shutdown , information on this website is available , but may not be up to date			1
' the closing is not expected to have much effect on @entity3 ’s industry giants , including @entity173 and @entity174 , who can continue to produce existing products as normal			1
but the shutdown poses a huge problem for smaller , craft brewers who build their business by producing quirky , unusual flavours and introducing new seasonal beers			1
prior to the shutdown craft brewers claim the @entity81 was taking up to 75 days to approve applications			1
now they are bracing themselves for longer delays			0
the impact has provoked anger among smaller producers			0
@entity192 , owner of @entity193 in @entity194 , near @entity195 in @entity196 took to @entity197 to air his annoyance			0
‘ ( @entity200 ) feds are gon na shut down the already incompetent @entity201 while hundreds of small breweries , including us , have labels pending			2
’ that was followed by : ‘ wan na regulate ? perform or get out of the way			0
’ @entity209 chief operating officer @entity208 called the @entity81 shutdown a ‘ headache ’			2
he said the company was planning to submit an application to package its autumn seasonal @entity214 in 22 - ounce bottles instead of 12 - ounce bottles but ca n't move forward			2
‘ it 's just aggravating , ’ he said			0
‘ it is frustrating that government ca n't do its job			0
doing what they 're doing now is unprecedented			0
’ @entity224 , a spokesman for @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity227 , said his brewery has three recipes and five new labels awaiting approval			0
the company is especially worried that the release of its new spring label , @entity234 , could get pushed back			0
more delays might force @entity225 to shell out extra money to speed up the label printing and rush the beer to market , he said			0
mr @entity224 said : ‘ everybody is frustrated in general			0
the whole way this has played out has been disappointing for the entire country			0
’ @entity77 in @entity29 has applications pending for new packaging of its @entity247 dark ale and for permission to offer a sour cherry dark lager called @entity250 , a brewery employee 's own concoction			0
the brewery hopes to launch the @entity247 packaging in november and @entity250 in december , but plans are on hold			2
‘ if the shutdown causes delays , the brewery will probably have to rush the beers to market , ’ he said			2
‘ if we lose that first month , we lose out on a good chunk of money , ’ brewery spokesman @entity263 said			2
‘ right now , it ’s only been a week so it ’s not too bad			0
‘ two weeks , three weeks is when we ’re really going to start sweating here			2
’ president @entity42 is locked in a budget battle with the @entity36 the shutdown of the @entity3 government began on october 1 after the two houses of @entity273 failed to agree a new budget			1
president @entity42 is locked in a battle with the @entity36 , who insisted they would not pass a bill to fund the government unless @entity278 agreed to delay the president ’s signature healthcare reforms by a year			0
the @entity37 ordered non-essential services to stop operating shortly before midnight local time on october 1 - the first shutdown for more than 17 years			1
the @entity284 , which is controlled by @entity278 , refused to negotiate with the @entity36 - dominated @entity285 over ‘ @entity111 ’ , which requires every @entity3 to buy health insurance or pay a fine			1
the lack of compromise means that nearly a million federal workers are on unpaid leave until the two legislative bodies come to an agreement			2
on tuesday president @entity42 opened a new chapter in the shutdown stand - off by announcing the @entity278 are ‘ willing to pass , at least , a short - term budget ’			1
but he added he wo n’t bargain , negotiate or otherwise strike a deal on extending @entity3 ’s $ 16.7trillion debt ceiling			1
hours later , house speaker @entity300 said that @entity42 's offer wo n't do			0
' the long and short of it is : there 's going to be a negotiation here , ' @entity300 said , referring to the more daunting debt limit fight			0
' we ca n't raise the debt ceiling without doing something about what 's driving us to borrow more money and to live beyond our means			0
the idea that we should continue to spend money that we do n't have , and give the bill to our kids and our grandkids would be wrong			0
' @entity42 had insisted that he would force republicans to negotiate with him in good faith , but only on the budget			0
' i think what has changed , ' he told reporters , ' is they 're aware of the fact that i 'm not budging when it comes to the full faith and credit of the @entity3 , that that has to be dealt with			1
' the president said he was open to a second sit - down meeting with @entity37 and @entity284 leaders			2
' i 'll even spring for dinner again , ' he said			0
' but i 'm not going to do it until the more extreme parts of the @entity36 stop forcing @entity300 to issue threats about our economy			0
we ca n't make extortion routine as part of our democracy			0
' @entity300 , however , dismissed @entity42 's terms			0
' the president 's position that , " listen , we 're not going to sit down and talk to you until you surrender " is just not sustainable , ' the @entity345 @entity36 said			0
' it 's not our system of government			0
