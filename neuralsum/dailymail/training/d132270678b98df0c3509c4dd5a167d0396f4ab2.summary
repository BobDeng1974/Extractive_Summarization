by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:12 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 11:25 est , 13 march 2014 @entity3 says he 's the @entity5 's top choice to run for governor of @entity7 , telling @entity9 's today show on thursday that ' @entity5 leaders want me to run so badly			1
' @entity3 is not running – at least not yet – but that has n't stopped him from using the possibility as a launching pad to promote his business ventures and vent his political spleen			1
' i think it can be won , ' he said of the race to oust @entity21 gov. @entity20			1
but ' the @entity5 in @entity7 is a mess , ' @entity3 claims , giving him an easy out if the whole idea is a giant tease			1
meanwhile , the multi-billionaire real estate tycoon has also left the door open for a presidential run , which some @entity5 insiders say would be a more logical salve for his ever - expanding ego			1
scroll down for @entity33 @entity3 appeared on the today show to promote his @entity36 pageant , but steered the conversation toward his political aspirations ' there 's no way " @entity3 " would be satisfied with running just one state , ' laughed a @entity5 operative in @entity43 who declined to be named			1
' and besides , can you imaging the great and all - powerful @entity3 living in @entity45 and giving up his @entity47 series ? the mind boggles			1
' but @entity50 , @entity7 @entity5 chairman @entity49 told @entity51 on thursday that @entity3 had ' spoken to me directly and told me that when he announces his candidacy [ for governor ] , he 's prepared to put $ 50 million in a bank account			1
' that amount would trump – pun intended – @entity20 's $ 33 million war chest			1
' it takes some effort to amass this			0
that 's occurring , as i understand it , now , ' @entity49 said			2
' as soon as the filming of [ @entity66 ] is complete , he 's then going to focus toward the may convention			0
' @entity3 may have his sights set even higher			2
clipping a microphone to his lapel has been a reliable prescription lately for an attack on the @entity74 @entity73 , and few long - shot presidential candidates can command such a large stage to level his charges			0
' [ @entity79 ] @entity78 has eaten @entity74 's lunch , and therefore our lunch for a long time , ' he said thursday , complaining about a weak - willed @entity73 that has let @entity84 run roughshod over parts of the old @entity86			1
@entity3 is scheduled to appear at the april 12 @entity43 @entity87 , an event in the first - in - the - nation primary state that will showcase more than a half - dozen potential @entity5 presidential candidates			1
sens. @entity92 of @entity93 , @entity94 of @entity95 and @entity96 of @entity97 will speak , along with former @entity99 governor and @entity101 host @entity100 , former house speaker @entity102 and @entity104 rep. @entity103			0
his first formal appearance on the pre- 2016 @entity5 speaking circuit came a week ago at the @entity107			2
but his message about unemployment and @entity1 weakness abroad sputtered beneath the weight of a headline - inducing gaffe in which he referred to the 39th @entity1 president as ' the late , great @entity114			2
' @entity114 is very much alive			0
@entity3 said thursday on @entity9 that @entity5 leaders want him to run against @entity7 governor @entity20 ' badly ' @entity3 was on the today show to announce that the june 2014 @entity36 event , which will air on @entity9 , will be held in @entity118 , @entity119			1
@entity36 is @entity1 's qualifying pageant for that global competition			0
he called the @entity119 's capital ' a place that really wanted us			2
' ' we had about 12 places that were fighting for the rights , and we just decided that 's sort of the home of pageantry , it 's sort of the home of the whole beauty thing			0
they 're terrific people , and they 're going to put on a great show			0
' ' usually we go to @entity137			0
we never fail in @entity137 , ' he said			0
' it 's great , but we thought we 'd move it			0
' @entity3 appeared alongside @entity36 2013 @entity141 , who announced that she intended to enter the entertainment industry after her reign is over			2
he has said he plans to decide whether or not to run for governor by the end of the week .			0

@entity3 could face a *crowded* @entity5 primary field but would have a huge *advantage* in name - *recognition*
@entity21 gov. @entity20 can run for a second term but has n't formally announced his candidacy yet
some *analysts* are calling @entity20 's *re-election* a ' shoo in '
@entity119 @entity5 chairman @entity5 , the *son* - in - *law* of the late president @entity157 , has n't ruled out running himself
