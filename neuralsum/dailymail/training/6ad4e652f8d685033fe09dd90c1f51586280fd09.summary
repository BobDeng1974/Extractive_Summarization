@entity0 , pictured , said people should start preparing for the @entity3 dinner by december 1 many consider it to be the most emotionally fraught meal of the year			1
but it does n’t need to be provided you get ‘ that big sheet out ’ and start planning on monday according to @entity0			1
according to the @entity10 star preparations need to be underway for the @entity3 turkey and trimmings by monday december 1			1

the more you think about it , the easier it is			0
it is only a big roast dinner			1
monday is december 1 and that is the time to get that big sheet of paper out and start planning and the more you think about it , plan it , it is … it ’s only a big roast dinner			1
’ she added : ‘ and not on the back of an envelope mind , a proper big sheet of what you ’re going to do – you do your cards by this time , what shopping you can do , what you can do for the freezer , what you can get ready and what is last minute			1
’ it spells bad news for anyone who thinks they can make do with a quick dash to the supermarket the week before @entity3			2
most shops are already selling their festive ranges			0
and miss @entity0 said it ’s worth spacing out the shopping and cooking by beginning it weeks in advance			2
it also helps spreads out the cost according to @entity58 , whose cookery business empire is thought to be worth as much as £ 5million			0
miss @entity0 said : ‘ you should be making the puddings and cakes now , although not everyone ’s like that			1
just do as much ahead as you can			0
then it ’s a nice feeling that it ’s done			0
’ she added : ‘ the more you can do ahead the better			0
i think really you ’ve got to find out who ’s coming for @entity3 , how many there are and even now get in the heavy , the tinned goods			2
’ ms @entity0 said when you consider it , @entity3 is only a big roast dinner and pretty simple to prepare miss @entity0 also said she precooks her turkey , before driving it to her son ’s house for dinner			1
the only thing she does n’t start on early is gift - shopping			0
speaking at the @entity77 , as she received a lifetime achievement award , miss @entity0 said : ‘ i wait for my family to give me lists			2
i have a very gorgeous daughter and daughter - in - law and i say please tell me what you ’d like			0
i do n’t do things out of the blue for them , because they know what they want			0
’ miss @entity0 , who is best known as a judge on @entity10 , has written more than seventy cookery books during her 50 - year career			2
she also has product ranges at @entity95 , @entity96 ’s and @entity97 and a line of salad dressings .			0
