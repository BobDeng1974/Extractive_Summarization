for those who witnessed @entity4 ’s approach to playing @entity5 at @entity6 in november at close quarters , suggestions that they are a robust and direct unit scarcely seem tantamount to slander			1
@entity10 ’s side may not quite have mirrored the ultra-industrial style favoured by @entity13 ’s men all those years ago , yet there were precious few morsels of real quality for the game ’s purists to feast on			1
were @entity19 then , doing any more than stating the blindingly obvious this week when they spoke extensively of @entity4 ’s one - dimensional , strong - arm strategy in their qualifying games thus far ? @entity23 celebrates scoring for @entity4 against @entity24 you would n’t have thought so but , then again , @entity10 , whose @entity4 side entertain the @entity26 in @entity27 , has never been one to resist an ever - so diplomatic counter-swipe at such accusations			1
clearly keen to gain the slightest psychological edge ahead of what is being viewed as a must win game for the @entity4 , the former @entity32 manager bristled when word of the @entity26 ’ comments was relayed to him at their @entity39 base on friday			1
‘ i ’m not really bothered about what they say — genuinely not bothered , ’ @entity10 insisted			1
‘ i ’m not so sure they could glean that from the games we have played			2
it ’s not for me to retort but @entity19 are as physical a side as i have seen in some time			1
@entity50 ’s side are a pretty accomplished one , too , however			1
currently sitting on top of @entity53 , @entity4 will surely need snookers to catch them if they leave the @entity55 with another maximum return of points			1
having won in @entity24 and pinched a point in @entity60 , @entity4 ’s campaign hit the buffers with defeat in @entity63 in their last competitive outing			1
in a section with next to no margin for error , @entity10 ’s side badly need to begin a sequence of four home games from five with a win			1
in that regard , a degree of calculated risk taking is in order			0
@entity23 ’s downturn in form has seen him excluded from @entity80 ’s @entity79 side since january 31 but – while far from ideal - his international manager sees that as no barrier to inclusion			1
@entity23 ’s downturn in form at @entity79 should not affect his @entity4 position ‘ you can get away on a bit of adrenaline if you are reasonably fit and i think he ’s been fit for a number of weeks			1
he just has n’t played for @entity79 in that time , ’ said @entity10 , who handed the player his @entity32 debut 11 years ago			1
‘ adrenaline can carry you a certain distance			0
you would n’t want to be going into a game with say three or four players not having played that much football			0
‘ that may happen but you know that as some stage these players are going to tire a bit			0
but it is what it is			0
‘ it ’s a disappointment from this side but i ’m not in charge of their club commitments			1
‘ listen , it would be absolutely fantastic if players were coming in here on the back of having played games the last couple of weekends			2
‘ you always sense it ’s never going to be that way			2
i was involved as a player at @entity120 and we had players coming in who had n’t played much at club level but suddenly they got a lift from playing international football			2
‘ that ’s what i ’d be hoping for			2
’ if @entity10 is bemused by @entity23 ’s exclusion at club level , he made a fine job of hiding it			1
‘ that ’s entirely up to @entity79 , ’ he straight - batted			1
‘ if i was to make that judgment on every single player at club level , i might be listening to the wrong comments			0
‘ @entity80 is absolutely entitled to pick whoever he wants to at club level			0
‘ if he does n’t think that @entity140 is playing well enough to be picked for his team , that ’s entirely up to him			2
@entity4 coach @entity142 shares a joke with @entity23 during training session ‘ we ’ve a different aspect here			1
he is obviously very important for us			0
he ’d a great start against @entity24 , continued that on although he may have been a little disappointed ( in how he played ) against @entity5			0
‘ overall , he is important to us			0
i think just the change of environment might just give him that lift			0
‘ he ’ll be a bit disappointed that he ’s not in the @entity79 starting side			1
but he ’ s here , he knows what he ’s done for us in the recent past and that should give him a lift			2
’ @entity23 might well be facing a familiar figure in the @entity26 goal			2
@entity160 , also formerly employed in @entity63 ’s @entity161 , is being tipped to win his 60th cap here after @entity164 ’s recent relegation to the @entity166 bench			2
‘ it ’s some years ago but in his spell at @entity32 he was one of the top five goalkeepers in @entity172 football , ’ said @entity10 , who left @entity167 in 2005 just as @entity160 was coming in			1
‘ of course , there ’s some water under the bridge since then and he ’s now down at @entity176			0
but he was a fine goalkeeper before and if the manager is thinking of picking him , he must have great faith in him at the moment			0
’ self - confidence among the @entity26 is scarcely at a premium			0
still unbeaten in the qualifiers , their only blemish so far came in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity5 in @entity186			0
@entity10 knows – from bitter experience in @entity63 – how the entire dynamic of the section can turn in an instant			2
his warning then , not to gift the likes of @entity193 a prized victory hardly needs to be overstated			0
‘ we ’re 75 minutes into the game and our concentration faded , ’ @entity10 recalled of @entity196 ’s winning goal from a set - piece			1
‘ i know as you get tired in a match your concentration goes a little bit , but that really should n’t happen			0
‘ i think @entity19 ’s approach will be a pretty positive , as suggested by the results they have got			1
‘ in the game against @entity60 there were moments in the match where i would say fortune broke for them at the time			0
‘ but they have earned that and they have put up points on the board			0
‘ their second - half performance against @entity24 in @entity222 was particularly strong			0
‘ i ’m expecting a big , big game			0
but this is the first match of a run where we have four out of five at home and it is up to us to do something about it			0

@entity4 take on @entity19 in @entity232 qualifier on *sunday*
@entity23 likely to feature despite lack of playing time at @entity79
@entity10 ’s side begin sequence of four home games from five
