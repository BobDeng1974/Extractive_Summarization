it is 72 days since @entity1 looked to the future and took the emotional decision to end his 114 - cap @entity5 career			1
he came to the conclusion that the time was right to make a clean break , having given his country 14 years ’ loyal service , so he could maximise his prospects of being @entity13 ’s dominant midfield influence for the next ' two , three or four ' seasons			1
after making public his plans , the 72 hours that followed were difficult and raw for @entity1			2
@entity5 ’s performance at the @entity19 had been scarring but the promise of helping @entity13 move forward provided ample solace			2
he wanted to give his boyhood club his undivided attention			2
@entity1 's sole focus is on @entity13 , having retired from international football over the summer @entity5 's disappointing performance at the @entity19 will have been difficult for @entity1 to take there were also reassuring words from @entity30			1
‘ a lot has gone on over the summer , ’ said @entity30 , during @entity13 ’s tour of the @entity32			1
‘ i am very happy that @entity1 is going to commit to @entity13 and i am sure that ( his contract ) is something we will look at			1
i know he can continue to play beyond this season			0
‘ i have always said that			0
now he does n’t have international football , he will have that freshness			0
listen , for his own mind , i am sure he will want it sorted out , absolutely			2
you never want to leave players with not too long to go on their contracts			0
it is something i am sure will get sorted			0
’ speaking over the summer , @entity13 manager @entity30 insisted @entity1 's contract would get sorted @entity1 trains alongside @entity48 on tuesday ahead of @entity13 's @entity50 clash with @entity51 it was intimated in the same conversation that @entity1 signing a new deal was a formality but , two and a half months on , there is an element of uncertainty starting to swirl around			1
discussions have yet to begin about extending the captain ’s present deal , which expires next june			2
‘ it ( the contract ) is something we are looking at as a club and with him and how he feels , ’ @entity30 said ahead of wednesday night ’s crucial @entity50 showdown with @entity51			1
‘ he is still in a real good physical condition			0
he ’s 34 years old , never needs a day ’s rest			0
‘ this is genuine superstar , a world class player who has performed consistently for so many years			0
this country has not produced too many of them			0
he will play and prepare himself right the way through to the very end ( and when that is we shall see )			0
‘ when he still strikes a ball there are not many like him , both his passing and his shooting ; i am certainly enjoying working with him and anyone who works closely with him should			0
every football person will know the qualities and influence he still has			0
’ so here are the questions : what is the delay ? @entity1 curls the ball over the @entity93 wall to give @entity13 the lead in last week 's @entity95 @entity1 gestures seemingly in response to recent criticism of his form being below its usual lofty standard why have @entity13 not removed from the equation the possibility that , on january 1 , @entity1 would be allowed to start speaking to clubs abroad about moving when his deal expires ? never before has he been so close to being a free agent			1
there will , ultimately , come a point in the future when @entity1 is no longer the fulcrum of @entity13 ’s team but that moment is not at as imminent as some of his critics have suggested during his side ’s fragmented start to the campaign			1
yes , there have been some games in which @entity1 has not reached the levels he would expect of himself but he , remember , is the reason @entity13 face @entity51 with three points rather than one , thanks to his coolly - dispatched last - gasp penalty against @entity124			1
when @entity1 was last in @entity13 with @entity51 , in november 2002 , he was unceremoniously hauled off at half - time by @entity126 and subjected to caustic criticism from his then manager , who implored that he did not waste his potential			1
@entity1 keeps his cool to slot home an injury - time penalty to give the @entity133 victory against @entity124 the last time @entity13 faced @entity51 , back in 2002 , @entity1 was hauled off at half - time with the @entity133 3 - 0 down @entity1 , of course , emerged from the salutatory lesson to become the finest player in @entity13 ’s history , a man whose fingerprints are all over the trophies they have won during this century			1
his influence will always be there – and it needs to be for some time longer			0
@entity30 has appreciated everything @entity1 has done for him since he arrived , from the moment he cut short a family holiday to welcome the new manager into his office at @entity151 ( ' he told me he would give me 100 per cent			1
he ’s given me 200 per cent ' ) to driving last season ’s title charge			0
the manager knows @entity1 ’s importance , as do the supporters			2
the next move is in the hands of @entity13 ’s hierarchy			2
@entity1 is an influential player for the @entity133 and has been an integral part of all the club 's wins this century			1

@entity1 yet to be offered a new contract by @entity13
@entity30 insisted he was sure a deal would be sorted for @entity1
@entity133 captain will be free to talk to clubs from abroad in january
@entity1 has been influential in many of the club 's victories this century
