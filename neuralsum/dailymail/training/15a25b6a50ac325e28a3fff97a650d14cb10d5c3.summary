it ’s a common problem : you sit down for dinner and your jeans fit perfectly , but the more you eat the tighter they get			2
at the moment you have to manually undo the zip to feel comfortable , but in the future your zip may be able to adjust automatically			2
a researcher from @entity10 has created the @entity11 that uses sensors to open and close the teeth in response to movement - such as an expanding waistline			1
in a video , the robotic zipper is shown moving autonomously across a zip placed on a flat surface as well as on material wrapped around an arm ( pictured ) the @entity11 was designed by @entity17 as part of his @entity20 thesis			1

@entity11 uses optical sensors to accurately line - up the teeth so the zip does n’t become jammed or snag on the surrounding material			1
it additionally uses motion sensors to detect movement			1
during a demonstration , mr @entity17 added the zipperbot to a skirt which released and tightened in relation to the wearer ’s movements			1
the leather @entity45 looks like a normal belt , but has a charger built into the buckle			0
it is held in place using magnets so it can be easily connected and disconnected			0
the belt , which comes in black and brown , can be charged up like an ordinary smartphone via a usb cable and has enough power to charge an @entity58 6 from scratch or ' pretty much any device ' in around three hours			0
the cable is concealed behind the leather part of the belt , which contains a flexible battery			0
and in theory , this means it could be used to loosen or tighten after a meal , or between standing up and sitting down			1
other uses include helping children or people with disabilities dress themselves , or self - closing zips on biohazard suits , for example			2
mr @entity17 said : ‘ @entity11 , a robotic continuous closure for fabric edge joining , was developed to explore autonomous control of a sartorial gesture and performed as a wearable robot which was evaluated through social interactions			1
‘ clothing is a uniquely human pursuit and is nearly universal in its adoption and use			0
‘ it plays a prominent role in our individual cultures transmitting a mixture of social signals and meanings through the semiotics of fashion			0
‘ merging robotics and fashion within the practice of @entity20 will enhance the explorations of identities for both humans and robots			0
at this year 's @entity103 , a @entity102 firm demonstrated its self - adjusting belt called @entity105			0
the smart prototype syncs wirelessly to an app to track steps , loosen and tighten as wearer 's move , and even warns them when they 're being lazy			2

in theory , this means it could be used to loosen or tighten after a meal , or between standing up and sitting down the metal and plastic model was created by @entity126 - based designers @entity127 and @entity128 at @entity129			1
if the waistline begins to expand , the belt warns the user via this app that they 're putting on weight			0
when sitting down , the belt expands to give the wearer more breathing space , and it automatically tightens when the wearer stands up again			1
it does this by tracking tension on sensors fitted throughout the belt			2
at this year 's @entity103 , @entity102 firm @entity145 demonstrated its self - adjusting belt called @entity105 ( pictured )			0
the smart prototype syncs wirelessly to an app to track steps , loosen and tighten as wearer 's move , and even warns them when they 're being lazy the app can additionally be used to set maximum and minimum fittings for the belt ( pictured ) , meaning it does n’t become too tight , or too loose , when automatically adjusting @entity158 will also warn wearers if they ’ve been sat still for too long , giving them a nudge to get up and walk around			1
the app can additionally be used to set maximum and minimum fittings , meaning it does n’t become too tight , or too loose , when automatically adjusting			2
plus , if the wearer leaves their fitness tracker at home , the belt includes an accelerometer and gyroscope to record steps and exercise levels , which also syncs with the app. the product is still under development but mr @entity127 said he hopes to have @entity158 on the market by the end of the year , with prices yet to be announced .			0

the @entity11 was designed by @entity10 researcher @entity17
it uses optical sensors to automatically open and close zips
@entity11 ’s motion sensors can also detect and respond to movement
in theory , it could loosen after a large meal or when sitting down
