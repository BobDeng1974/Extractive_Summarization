' following the court hearing the victims released statements describing the physical and emotional trauma they had suffered			0

another victim said : ' at the time ms @entity2 held a sharp object against my throat i was relieved she did not seriously injure me			1
' my relief soon subsided as the after effects kicked in			0
i now go out less than i did and when i do go out i ’m always watching my back			0
