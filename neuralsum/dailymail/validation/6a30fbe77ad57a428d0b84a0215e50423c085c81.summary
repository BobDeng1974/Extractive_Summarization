' it was eventually established it was actually a coatimundi that was on the loose after escaping from a home in the area			0
' we soon discovered where he had escaped from and were in contact with the owners about getting him home safely			2
' the coati seemed to be favouring three gardens by the river to visit for food so we laid a humane trap with pieces of fresh fruit at one of the properties			2

caught : the coati escaped from its private owners after @entity9 and was finally captured in a humane trap ' considering he had been on the run for around two months he was in a very good condition and it was lovely to be able to reunite him with his owners			1
