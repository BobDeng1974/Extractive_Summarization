@entity9 , 19 , ( left ) from @entity10 , @entity11 , has been jailed for four years and eight months after admitting to strangling her 55 - year - old mother @entity13 ( right )			1
she denied murder but admitted manslaughter ' i am sure on this occasion you lost your self - control			2
you smothered your mother with a pillow as you had tried to a greater or lesser extent on two previous occasions in weeks earlier , ' the judge said			1
' on this occasion you smothered her with a pillow possibly in the course of a further argument superimposed upon others which had happened earlier that evening			2
' you resisted her efforts to struggle during which i am satisfied she scratched your face and you smothered her for about 15 seconds			0
' @entity43 @entity42 heard that it ' had been a disaster waiting to happen			0
' the judge told @entity9 , who showed no emotion during the hearing , that he did not accept her suggestion that she had not intended to kill her mother , who was suffering with alcoholism			1
' i am sure you did			0
you had had enough and that is something you will have to live with for the rest of your life , ' the judge said			0
referring to their relationship he said : ' although in many respects and in difficult circumstances your mother did her best for you and you for her , it was clear that over a period of years you suffered long term mental cruelty at her hands			2
' ' her addiction to alcohol for many years which she managed to keep from her close family clouded her judgement and it was drink which affected her ability to behave as a normal mother should			2
@entity9 , 19 , ( pictured ) admitted killing her mother following an argument on the evening of january 6 ' sadly a picture has been painted of a young girl who was belittled and under - valued and had to withstand the sort of pressure which no teenager should have to			1
' he said it was not a constant picture as they had enjoyed some good times			0
' your mother was , i think , like the girl with a curl in the nursery rhyme who when she was good was very good and when she was bad she was horrid , ' he said			0
' i am satisfied your relationship with your mother had been continuing in a gradual spiral for many years			2
he pointed out that after the killing at their home in @entity10 on the evening of january 6 , @entity9 returned to a friend 's home and the next day feigned shock and surprise at the death of her mother , who worked as a domestic at @entity107			1
she tried to claim , at a friend 's suggestion , that an intruder may have been to blame after a post-mortem examination found that @entity13 had died from asphyxiation			2
a jury cleared the student and part - time care worker of murder at a trial in june after agreeing she had lost control after being provoked			0
during the trial , the jury heard how @entity9 , who has an iq of 80 , had been unable to cope with the pressure of wanting to leave home and her mother 's wish for her to stay			1
she agreed to stay with her mother , whose number she had stored under ' the @entity127 * * * h ' , if she promised to stop drinking			0
however , @entity13 started drinking again and on night of the incident , they rowed before @entity9 returned home to get some belongings so she could stay overnight with a friend			1
they had a further argument and shortly afterwards @entity9 rang a friend and said : ' i 've killed my mum , i swear down i 've done it			0
' a jury cleared @entity9 ( above ) of murder in june but the teenager , who showed no emotion at the hearing , admitted manslaughter and was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison at @entity147 the next morning she returned home and rang 999 saying she had found her mother ' all blue ' on the floor			1
@entity150 , @entity16 , defending , said , ' here was a disaster waiting to happen			0
there was a most appalling set of circumstances building up between the deceased and the defendant			0
' it is a tragedy worth remarking upon that the deceased 's life although tried to make it good and in many ways was a good mother as best she could it fell very far short of the mark on occasion			0
' @entity9 admitted manslaughter in april and was jailed for four years and eight months by @entity167 today who told her : ' your family life may have been a very sad and very difficult one but that family is now totally destroyed and split by what you did			1
