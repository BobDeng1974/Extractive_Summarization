by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 19:46 est , 12 march 2014 lucrative pay deal : @entity3 is one of the highest - paid university chiefs despite falling numbers the head of the @entity7 is seeking a £ 45,000 - a - year aide to write his speeches despite his own £ 407,000 pay packet			1
the bumper pay deal handed to @entity3 fuelled growing anger last night over the size of salaries enjoyed by university chiefs and expanding higher education bureaucracies			2
since mr @entity3 took over at the @entity7 in 2009 , student numbers have slumped by more than 50,000 and tuition fees more than tripled – a bigger relative increase than at any conventional university			1
he took home £ 351,000 in 2012/13 , swollen by his pension to £ 407,000 , which made him one of the highest - paid university vice-chancellors in the country			1
now it has emerged mr @entity3 , an @entity28 - born former @entity27 executive , has advertised for a ‘ speechwriter ’ on a salary of £ 37,756 to £ 45,053 - a - year			1
the chosen candidate , who will be the second holder of the post , will ‘ be responsible for researching , writing and editing all of the vice-chancellor ’s speeches , explaining often complex ideas in an engaging and inspirational way ’			0
mr @entity3 is unusual among vice-chancellors in not having an academic background			0
instead he worked for education and technology firms including @entity27 , where he was responsible for developing and marketing education products			0
the pay of his predecessor , professor @entity44 , was £ 309,000 when she left in 2009 , 24 per cent less than mr @entity3 ’s			2
controversies during his tenure include the decision to more than treble tuition fees , from £ 1,540 for a full - time degree to £ 5,000 a year , and part - time courses from around £ 700 to £ 2,500			1
controversies during mr @entity3 's tenure since 2009 include more than tripling the fees from £ 1,540 to £ 5,000 a year it prompted claims the university , set up in 1969 to help those who may have missed out on educational opportunities earlier in their lives , had ‘ sold out ’ its founding principles			1
mr @entity3 ’s £ 407,000 package is 11 per cent higher than in 2011/12			2
the university said this was because he took a pay cut of 10 per cent in 2010 ‘ amid great uncertainty over future funding ’			0
in 2012/13 , the year the fee increase kicked in , his salary was restored to the full rate			0
the @entity7 said this was because it was ‘ well prepared for the new funding environment ’			0
in a speech last year , mr @entity3 – or possibly his previous speechwriter – said a new @entity7 - led ‘ @entity77 ’ initiative to put vast numbers of courses online would allow students to escape the authority of ‘ @entity80 ’ , or in other words , a university that tells students ‘ you ’re a failure because you did n’t do what we said ’			1
he added : ‘ we ’re going to let people set their own targets			0
’ ministers have repeatedly called for universities to show ‘ restraint ’ when awarding pay to senior figures			0
yet vice-chancellors in the 24 - strong @entity94 of leading universities took home average pay rises of £ 22,000 in the last academic year , taking their earnings , including salary and pension , to £ 318,500			1
professor @entity101 , vice-chancellor of @entity102 , is thought to have one of the highest basic salaries , at £ 400,000			0
@entity105 , of the @entity106 , which represents lecturers and other academic staff , said : ‘ in a year when fees have tripled and pay for other university staff continues to fall , these salary hikes will be particularly galling			1
’ in 2010 , business secretary @entity112 warned vice-chancellors ’ pay bore ‘ no relation to the underlying economics of the country ’			0
an @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ the salary offered @entity3 reflects the scale and complexity of the job			2
‘ under @entity3 ’s leadership , the @entity7 has maintained its place as one of the highest ranked institutions for student satisfaction in the @entity128 , kept its fees among the lowest in the county and brought together leading @entity128 universities to form @entity77			1
’ he said mr @entity3 had spoken at more than 50 events around the world in the past 12 months , and received 200 speaking requests a year .			2

@entity3 is the third - highest paid university executive in the @entity128
has now advertised for speechwriter with up to £ 45,000 - a - year salary
follows numbers dropping by 50,000 and fees more than tripling
