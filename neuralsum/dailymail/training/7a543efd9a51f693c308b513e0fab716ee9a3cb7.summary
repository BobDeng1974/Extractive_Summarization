by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:10 est , 2 february 2014 hundreds of thousands more union members will be able to play a more active role due to @entity7 's reforms , @entity3 has said @entity8 baron @entity3 yesterday hailed @entity7 ’s reforms to @entity11 ’s links with the trade unions as ‘ music to my ears ’			1
the unite general secretary , whose union has given @entity11 more than £ 8 million since mr @entity7 became leader , said they would allow potentially hundreds of thousands more union members to ‘ play a more active role ’			1
@entity20 insists its plans to change the way the party elects its leaders and takes money from the unions is mr @entity7 ’s ‘ @entity27 moment ’ , a reference to when @entity29 changed its constitution			2
deputy leader @entity31 insisted that allowing union members to pay £ 3 to affiliate to @entity11 and then vote in the leadership elections would ‘ breathe fresh life ’ into the party			1
she accused critics of being ‘ phobic ’ about trade union , telling the @entity40 ’s @entity39 programme : ‘ what it ’s about is opening up the @entity11 to people at workplaces up and down the country , broadening the base of the @entity11			2
‘ i do n’t know what you mean about ‘ a trade union direction ’ ; if you mean people who care about more people being able to get jobs , being able to have the living wage , caring about decent terms and conditions , caring about equality and social justice , well yes , that ’s a good thing , that ’s what the @entity11 believes in			2
’ mr @entity7 says he wants to ‘ mend , not end ’ @entity11 ’s link to the unions , and asked former trade unionist and @entity11 general secretary to draw up proposals that will be discussed this week by the party ’s ruling body			1
individual members of an affiliated trade union will be given a straight ‘ yes or no ’ choice about whether they want to pay a small sum that will be given to @entity11			2
those that want to pay this fee will also be asked if they wish - at no extra cost - to become an ‘ affiliated supporter ’ who has a direct relationship with the party as an individual			0
mr @entity7 said : ‘ this is about completing unfinished business from the past 20 years and creating a @entity84 built on the principle of one member , one vote			0
‘ and it is about letting the people back into our politics : giving people a real choice and a real voice in our party ; changing @entity11 so that @entity11 can change our country			2
’ the @entity97 - and some @entity11 critics -- say the changes will make it easier for union members to determine @entity11 leadership contests , greatly increasing the number who can vote and diluting the power of @entity106 over the outcome			0
mr @entity7 - whose received £ 8m from @entity108 since he became leader of the party - says he wants to ¿ mend , not end ¿ @entity113 s link to the unions they also warn that giving individuals a choice over whether or not to pay affiliation fees means more cash will acculumate in unions ’ political funds , which leaders can then choose whether or not to hand to the party			1
mr @entity3 told @entity127 @entity126 ’s @entity125 ’s politics : ‘ for me it was n’t necessarily a question of gaining or losing power when @entity7 [ @entity130 ] made his statement back in the summer of last year			1
he was talking about giving an opportunity to ordinary trade unionists – maybe hundreds of thousands - to play a more active role within the @entity11			1
that was music to my ears , which is why we welcome the proposals			0
’ @entity140 , head of the @entity142 union , told the @entity40 ’s @entity143 , said the proposed changes to leadership elections were ‘ very sensible ’ and the perception of a union ‘ bloc vote ’ has always been a myth			0
professor @entity150 , a trade union expert , said : ‘ it is not clear that @entity7 believes that this change will reduce union influence			0
it just changes the nature of that influence			0
but fundamentally those people who pay the bills , the unions , will still have a big say in party policy			0
’ @entity163 chairman @entity162 said : ‘ @entity7 promised to loosen the trade union barons ’ grip on the @entity84			0
but he has been too weak to deliver			0
‘ until now , the union barons could buy @entity11 ’s policies and pick @entity11 ’s leader			1
after these changes , it will be even easier for the union barons to buy @entity11 ’s policies and even easier to pick the leader			1
and @entity7 has done nothing that would stop the unions fixing @entity11 ’s candidate selections			1

@entity108 has given @entity11 more than £ 8m since @entity7 became leader
party leader 's reforms to union linke ' music to my ears ' @entity3 said
will mean thousands will play more active role , union leader added
