baby - related social media updates , wearing clothes that match your child 's , and bemoaning a lack of social life thanks to your growing brood have been voted the parenting habits we find most irksome			2
being forced to listen to a newborn 's gurgling down the phone and hearing friends do cutesy voices for their infants are also high on the list of annoying parental pastimes , according to a survey			2
from feeding habits to his friendship with @entity43 the dog , @entity1 loves sharing information , photos and anecdotes about her son @entity5 via @entity3 and @entity49 not disciplining unruly tots in public and swearing in front of your children also made the list of the most irritating traits of mothers and fathers , according to myvouchercode.co.uk			1
the survey also found that @entity60 people are n't keen on parents who wax lyrical about how perfect their children are ... and are equally put out when they criticise other people 's			1
@entity65 , @entity66 chairman , said : ' it can be tricky to admit to your friends what you find annoying about their parenting habits , even more so if you do n't have children yourself as they could return the criticism by blaming you for not understanding what being a parent feels like			1
' i guess all you can do is try to see the funny side of these things			0
and i 'm sure even if most of us will agree to find at least one of these things annoying , we 'll all end up doing the same once we have children			2
' @entity6 commits the parental sin of dressing like her children , left , while @entity1 overshares about her baby on @entity3 @entity13 ( @entity88 ) takes to @entity49 to explain why all her time is taken up with babies , a habit @entity60 people find irritating 1			1
