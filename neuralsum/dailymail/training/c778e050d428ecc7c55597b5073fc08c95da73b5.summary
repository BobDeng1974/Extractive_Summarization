by @entity0 they look good enough to hang in a gallery , but each of these stunning images is smaller than the width of a human hair			1
scientists created them using a breakthrough imaging technique that ‘ draws ’ pictures on materials using particles and atoms			2
as well as being beautiful images , they are extremely high - resolution and could pave the way for ultra-thin flexible displays			1
the breakthrough material was created by @entity19 scientists who realised they could electrically switch ' nano - pixels ' - just 300 by 300 nanometres in size - on and off to create coloured dots			1
pictured is an image of a tiger that is smaller than the width of a human hair the system relies on ‘ nano - pixels ’ just 300 nanometres across that can be electrically turned on or off to create a mosaic of coloured dots on a display			1
a team led by @entity19 scientists explored the link between the electrical and optical properties of phase change materials - materials that can change from flowing to a crystalline state			1
they discovered that by sandwiching a seven nanometre thick layer of this material between two layers of a transparent electrode they could use a tiny current to ' draw ' images			0
initially still images were created using an atomic force microscope , but the team went on to demonstrate that such tiny ' stacks ' can be turned into prototype pixel - like devices			2
these ' nano - pixels ' - just 300 by 300 nanometres in size – can be electrically switched on and off at will			1
this creates tiny coloured dots that could be used on an extremely high - resolution displays			1
the layers of the material are created using a sputtering technique where high energy particles are fired on the material at a certain point			2
these atoms are then transferred onto another material as a thin film			0
a report of the research is published in this week 's nature			0
by comparison , the width of a human hair is approximately 80,000 to 100,000 nanometres wide			1
this is done by sending tiny currents through layers of ‘ phase changing ’ material , that can switch from a flowing to a crystalline state			0
the discovery makes it possible to create images just a few hundred nanometres across			1
by creating such tiny pixels , this means images could be shown on extremely high - resolution and low - energy thin , flexible displays			1
such displays could be used in smart glasses , synthetic retinas , and foldable screens			1
' we did n't set out to invent a new kind of display , ' said professor @entity93 of @entity19 's @entity94 , who led the research			0
' we were exploring the relationship between the electrical and optical properties of phase change materials and then had the idea of creating this ' sandwich ' made up of layers just a few nanometres thick			0
‘ we found that not only were we able to create images in the stack but , to our surprise , thinner layers of @entity107 actually gave us better contrast			0
researchers discovered that by sandwiching a seven nanometre thick layer of phase change material - a material that can switch between flowing and crystallised - between two layers of a transparent electrode they could use a tiny current to ' draw ' images ( pictured ) the discovery makes it possible to create images just a few hundred nanometres across , that could pave the way for high - resolution and low - energy , flexible displays for applications such as synthetic retinas , and foldable screens ( pictured )			1
the @entity129 team has filed a patent on the discovery with the help of @entity133 ‘ we also discovered that altering the size of the bottom electrode layer enabled us to change the colour of the image			0
' although the work is still in its early stages , the @entity129 team has filed a patent on the discovery with the help of @entity133 , @entity19 's technology commercialisation company			0
@entity133 is now discussing the displays with companies who are interested in assessing the technology , and with investors			0
the layers of the gst sandwich are created using a sputtering technique where high energy particles are fired on the material at a certain point			2
initially , still images were created using an atomic force microscope , but the team went on to demonstrate that such tiny ' stacks ' could be turned into prototype pixel - like devices			2
researchers said that not only were they able to create images ( pictured ) in the stack but , the thinner layers of material produced a better contrast the team has already demonstrated that the technique works on flexible @entity168 sheets around 200 nanometres thick			1
the prototype pixels can also be tuned to create any colour we want - including the primary colours needed for a display			2
pictured is a image of a @entity176 drawn using nano - pixels these atoms are then transferred onto another material as a thin film			1
the phase change material used was the alloy @entity183 ( @entity107 or @entity107 ) sandwiched between electrode layers made of indium tin oxide ( @entity186 )			0
' because the layers that make up our devices can be deposited as thin films they can be incorporated into very thin flexible materials – we have already demonstrated that the technique works on flexible @entity168 sheets around 200 nanometres thick , ' said professor @entity93			0
' this makes them potentially useful for ' smart ' glasses , foldable screens , windshield displays , and even synthetic retinas that mimic the abilities of photoreceptor cells in the human eye			1
' professor @entity205 of @entity19 's @entity94 said : ' our models are so good at predicting the experiment that we can tune our prototype ' pixels ' to create any colour we want – including the primary colours needed for a display			2
the research suggests that flexible paper - thin displays based on the technology could also have the capacity to switch between a power - saving ' colour e-reader mode ' , and a backlit display capable of showing video			2
wave image pictured ‘ one of the advantages of our design is that , unlike most conventional lcd screens , there would be no need to constantly refresh all pixels , you would only have to refresh those pixels that actually change - static pixels remain as they were			0
‘ this means that any display based on this technology would have extremely low energy consumption			0
' the research suggests that flexible paper - thin displays based on the technology could have the capacity to switch between a power - saving ' colour e-reader mode ' , and a backlit display capable of showing video			2
such displays could also be created using cheap materials			0
co-author professor @entity246 of the @entity247 at the @entity248 added : ' along with many other researchers around the world we have been looking into the use of these gst materials for memory applications for many years , but no one before thought of combining their electrical and optical functionality to provide entirely new kinds of high - resolution , electronic colour displays – so our work is a real breakthrough			1

the breakthrough material was created by @entity19 scientists
they used it to switch ' nano - pixels ' on and off to create coloured dots
each pixel is 300 by 300 nanometres in size - smaller than a human hair
@entity283 creates images just a few hundred nanometres across
this could pave the way for high - resolution , low - energy flexible displays
it could be used in smart glasses , synthetic retinas , and foldable screens
