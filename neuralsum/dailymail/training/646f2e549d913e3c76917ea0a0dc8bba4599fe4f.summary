having been away for three years on an ' amorous adventure ' , @entity0 is now sleeping in a converted barn on his historic 6,000 acre estate the homecoming was nothing like it used to be			1
at one time , the staff at @entity7 , a vast , historic country house , rich with royal memories , would greet @entity0 in the great , pillared hall , @entity10 - style			1
this time , having been away for more than three years , he slipped sheepishly through the gates of the 6,000 - acre @entity13 estate , where both the @entity14 and prince @entity15 spent part of their honeymoons			1
but he did not head for the four towering pillars framing the front door of the @entity22 mansion left to him by his grandfather , @entity24 of @entity25			1
instead , he made for a converted barn , where his belongings were unloaded from the car			1
@entity0 , prince @entity15 ’s godson and lifelong friend , and cousin of the @entity15 , was back after an extraordinary , amorous adventure with an exotic beauty that had taken him to the @entity33			1
several weeks after this bizarre return , he is still not living in his ancestral and marital home			2
to put it mildly , things are no longer quite the same since he walked away from his 31 - year marriage			2
family friends say it is ‘ doubtful ’ that @entity0 will be able to effect a rapprochement with his wife @entity42 — prince @entity15 ’s carriage - driving companion — whose father began life as a butcher , before making a fortune as the founder of the @entity50 chain			1
thus far , the formidable @entity51 has given no indication that she is even considering inviting her wayward husband , @entity53 , to come back and live under the roof of the historic house , far less into her bed			1
understandably , she is an angry wife			2
broadlands was left to @entity0 in the expectation that he would devote his life to maintaining an estate of unique historic provenance , where @entity62 used to play the piano at weekend house parties when the @entity14 and @entity15 were staying			1
instead , @entity42 has been running it — and doing so rather well			2
in her husband ’s absence — making a mockery of the family motto ‘ in @entity77 ’ — she even took over his role of @entity71 of nearby @entity72 , wearing the blue - and - gold robes with style , and carrying out the ceremonial duties with enormous aplomb			1
@entity78 ( left ) has refused to allow her husband back into the marital home after he walked out on their 31 - year marriage to be with @entity82 ( right ) , a @entity33 fashion designer she has further stepped into his shoes by becoming patron of @entity86			1
with a touch of poetic justice , it is a rather frail - looking @entity0 who has been seen in recent days , pottering around the estate			1
the man who will be the next @entity24 on the death of his 90 - year - old mother , @entity94 , told one local : ‘ i made a mistake , but i ’m back for good — back home			1
’ that sounds like a man who wants to rebuild his life			1
this may not be easy			2
apart from his wife running the estate — her photograph now adorns the official @entity7 website — his daughter @entity106 , 31 , has supplanted him as patron of @entity108 in @entity72			1
she has also taken over , while her father was absent , as president of the town ’s scouts — the first woman to have the honour			2
it was in 2010 that @entity0 left @entity7 for @entity115 , to be with @entity82 , a @entity33 fashion designer , whose clothes sell in the enclaves of the rich , such as @entity118 , in @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity121 , in the @entity122			1
just a few weeks earlier , he had cried out ‘ wow ’ on seeing a picture she had posted of herself on @entity125			0
he had previously met her through her late husband , sir @entity128 , a tax exile whose money came from a family engineering company			1
for 66 - year - old @entity133 , the eighth @entity134 , his amorous adventure was also an escape from what he saw as the drudgery of running the @entity7 estate			1
unlike television ’s @entity139 , who saw the care and preservation of @entity10 as his life ’s work , @entity0 hated it			1
‘ at first , his new life was idyllic , ’ says a family friend , ‘ but eventually , it all began to go sour			1
frankly , i think @entity82 began to tire of him			1
she ’s got her dress business to run , she ’s always busy			0
he ’s a nice bloke with a title , but not very exciting			0
’ happier days : lord and @entity51 at the @entity153 for the @entity155 match in which prince @entity15 was playing rumours that things were not going well with them began to circulate two years ago			1
finally , the couple decided their relationship did n’t have a future , and he crept back to @entity162			1
in @entity115 this week , @entity163 , an attractive widow for seven years , has been concentrating on her successful boutique			0
‘ i ’m so sorry , ’ she says , ‘ but i do n’t feel comfortable at the moment with what has happened			0
’ the @entity167 , meanwhile , are glad that @entity53 has returned to @entity7 , but confused as to what it might mean			1
members of the family , the @entity14 in particular , are full of admiration for @entity173 and the way she has held things together , insisting that life at @entity7 must go on as normal , despite her husband ’s betrayal			1
indeed , in @entity0 ’s absence , no private royal event has been complete without an invitation to @entity42			1
@entity182 is a name automatically added to every @entity185 guest list			0
over the years , the striking @entity42 , 60 , has also been a decorative carriage - driving companion of prince @entity15 , 92			0
the two have competed in countless shows across the country			0
but her closeness to the @entity167 initially came through @entity53 ’s friendship with @entity15			0
‘ @entity14 and @entity15 have never forgotten how he helped @entity15 ( a year younger ) get through the trials and troubles of @entity195 , ’ says a family friend			2
‘ there ’s always been a special feeling because of the terrible tragedies that beset his family			2
but they ca n’t really forgive him for what he did to @entity42			0
’ there are serious doubts that he will ever again enjoy the level of intimacy he once had with the @entity208			0
those in the couple ’s circle wonder if @entity42 will weaken and have him back			2
‘ it ’s unlikely , but i doubt if she would ever contemplate divorce , either , because that would mean her leaving @entity7 , ’ says a close figure			0
‘ she will never do that			0
’ the reason is the presence of a tall stone standing on a plinth , 100 yards from the house , in full view of the drawing room			2
that is where the @entity226 ’ daughter @entity225 , who had kidney cancer and died 23 years ago at the age of five , is buried			0
‘ @entity53 was uneasy about putting her grave there , because he feared it would mean they would never get over the death of the little girl they loved so much , ’ says a friend			0
she wanted @entity225 to be where she could always see her and be with her			0
so she will never leave @entity7 , never			0
’ tragedy has certainly plagued this marriage , at which @entity53 ’s best man was prince @entity15			0
the ceremony at @entity7 , and reception for 1,000 , had to be postponed for eight weeks after @entity246 bombers blew up a small boat in the sea off @entity249 , @entity250 , in august , 1979			0
it killed @entity53 ’s grandfather , @entity24 , his 14 - year - old younger brother @entity253 , his paternal grandmother , the @entity254 , and @entity255 , a local boy who was with the family			2
@entity253 ’s twin brother @entity257 , and his parents , were all injured			0
@entity24 ’s murder meant that the newlyweds moved straight into @entity7			0
but the tragedies do not end there			0
their 32 - year - old son , @entity253 ( named after @entity53 ’s younger brother ) , has battled a drug problem			0
he spent years on crack cocaine and heroin , living in drug dens and bedsits			0
intriguingly , he began to overcome his addictions at around the time his father was flying to @entity115 to be with @entity82			1
some family friends feel that the two events are not unconnected			2
‘ it ’s as though something told him his mother needed some moral support , ’ says one			0
' members of the family , the @entity14 in particular , are full of admiration for @entity173 ( left ) and the way she has held things together , insisting that life at @entity7 must go on as normal , despite her husband ¿ s betrayal ' @entity287 , a ‘ digital artist ’ , is understood to have been ‘ clean ’ for more than three years , and has his own small company making computer - generated videos for the music industry			1
he lives in @entity292 and is engaged to a nurse , @entity293 , whose family come from @entity295			2
she , of course , will one day be the @entity298 , when @entity253 succeeds to the title			0
@entity287 is a year older than prince @entity300 and was given the responsibility of showing him the ropes at @entity303 , though they have n’t stayed close			0
despite @entity287 ’s apparent recovery , it remains unlikely that he will be entrusted with the running of the estate when the time comes			2
mindful of his difficult past , that role has been earmarked for his sister @entity106 , a forensic accountant , who is a rising star in @entity292 with a major firm of @entity316 business consultants			0
but will she want to take on @entity7 ? she is in a long - term relationship with @entity318 , an entrepreneur who connects specialist maths tutors in @entity320 to schools across the @entity162 via @entity322			0
‘ they ’re great together and very happy — but @entity106 ’s mother is getting rather anxious that they have n’t married yet , ’ says a family figure			2
which brings us back to @entity51 ’s own marriage			1
since her husband ’s reappearance , he has moved from the barn into a converted dairy , closer to the big house			1
could that be a sign of things to come ? friends say he should n’t hold his breath			0
additional reporting : @entity53 .			0

@entity0 left family estate in 2010 for life with foreign beauty

she has even taken on ceremonial roles her husband was to fill
