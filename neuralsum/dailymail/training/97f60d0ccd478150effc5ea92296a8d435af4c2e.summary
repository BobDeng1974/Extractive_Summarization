a video that was filmed over the summer shows a @entity3 police officer threatening a teen just moments before knocking him out - and all reportedly over a cigarette			1
lawyers for @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity3 , claim the 17 - year - old was walking home from school on june 4 when a plainclothes police officer stopped the boy , believing the cigarette he was smoking was marijuana			1
it is uncertain what happens immediately after the boy was stopped , but as the video shows , it ends with the officer hitting @entity7 so hard as he lays on the ground that the young boy appears to be knocked unconscious			2
pleading : @entity7 was threatened and hit by an unknown officer during an incident that happened on june 4 of the year ( above ) video : @entity7 's friends taped the incident , which shows the officer asking the boy if he wants to get ' f * * * ed up ' before hitting him now , his family is saying the young man has suffered from headaches , dizziness , and memory loss since the incident			1
the video opens with @entity7 laying on the ground and pleading with the officer that it was ' just a cigarette , ' as the cop screams at the teen , ' do you wan na get f * * * ed up ? ' the officer then goes even further , letting the boy 's friends he is fine with them filming the incident , seeming to imply he does not believe he is doing anything wrong			1
' yeah , get it on film , ' he tells the high school students			0
the sound of @entity7 being hit is heard soon after and then the boy 's entire body goes limp			0
a second man , who appears to also be an undercover officer , runs over and helps the first cop put cuffs on the seemingly unconscious teen , and at one point reaches into his back pocket as seen in the video , which was released by @entity60			2
the names of the officers are not known at this time			0
brutality : after being struck by the officer , @entity7 appears to go limp and seems unconscious ' if what happened on this video was reversed and @entity7 assaulted this officer in the same exact manner , @entity7 would be prosecuted , and this officer should be prosecuted for what he did , ' said attorney @entity69 , who is handling the family ’s civil suit			2
he added that @entity7 was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and pleaded guilty to a violation			0
the @entity74 said the incident is under investigation by the department ’s @entity77 .			0
