a good - natured police officer has joined in with a cricket match
the match was played on the street in @entity27 on @entity5
those playing *believed* the game was going to be shut down by the officer
the *talented* policeman bowled someone out and then took to the bat
he hit a six , meaning he was out according to the rules of *backyard* cricket
however he also *accidentally* ended the game for the day by losing the ball
