trainer @entity0 insists he has not lost faith in @entity2 after the 2014 @entity4 winner beat only one home in saturday ’s @entity6			1
but @entity8 ’s determination to keep the son of @entity10 away from the fast ground he encountered at @entity12 means the colt looks more likely to head to the @entity15 2,000 guineas rather than the @entity17 equivalent at @entity18 on may 2			1
@entity19 riding @entity2 to win the @entity20 at @entity18 @entity0 , who has an interesting @entity22 trial contender in @entity12 maiden winner @entity23 , said : ‘ @entity24 ( @entity25 ) looked after him and we will protect him from fast ground in future			1
his work in the build - up to the race had been excellent			0
’ @entity8 had plenty of practise of planning such a programme last year when keeping his currently sidelined @entity36 winner @entity35 away from quick ground			1
@entity19 riding @entity35 to win the @entity39 at @entity40 a trip to @entity15 for @entity2 could mean a re-match with @entity6 winner @entity43			1
trainer @entity44 said the @entity15 guineas was an option for his colt			2
@entity48 is ‘ pretty certain ’ @entity4 runner - up @entity49 will miss the @entity45 after picking up an injury			2
but @entity52 says @entity53 is likely to take her place in the @entity55 on may 3 despite her disappointing third to @entity58 ’s @entity57 in the @entity59 , an effort that prompted some bookies to remove her from ante - post lists			0
@entity52 ‘ s @entity6 second and third , @entity64 and @entity65 , also remain on course for the @entity45 where they could meet his @entity68 winner @entity67			2
@entity52 also has @entity68 third @entity69 in the @entity45			0
@entity70 will have to choose whether to ride him or @entity72 ’s @entity71			0
both are owned by @entity74			0
@entity53 ridden by @entity75 wins the @entity76 at @entity77 the @entity71 ridden by @entity70 breaks away to win the @entity78 at @entity79 @entity75 riding @entity80 in the @entity81 during @entity82 at @entity18			0

@entity0 says he has not lost faith in @entity4 winner @entity2
@entity2 beat only one home in saturday ’s @entity6 at @entity12
@entity8 *'s* determination to avoid fast ground means colt may head to @entity15
he is likely to target @entity15 2,000 guineas rather than @entity17 equivalent
