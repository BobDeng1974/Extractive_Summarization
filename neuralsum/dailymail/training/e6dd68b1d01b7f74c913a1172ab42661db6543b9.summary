by @entity0 @entity1 : 21:12 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:46 est , 21 december 2013 tragic : city worker @entity3 , 25 , was discovered face down in the water at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , two years ago one of sir @entity10 ’s health clubs has been fined £ 100,000 after a former model drowned in an unsupervised swimming pool			1
@entity13 worker @entity3 , 25 , was discovered face down in the water at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , two years ago			1
she was discovered face down in the water at the company ’s flagship £ 145 - a - month @entity7 branch two years ago			1
yesterday her grieving parents were in court to hear the company blasted for a series of health and safety failings			2
prosecutors said the risks leading to @entity3 ’s death were ‘ entirely foreseeable ’ and said managers were responsible for a string of ‘ serious shortcomings ’			1
it was revealed that blundering staff did n’t even know the young woman ’s identity and were forced to search her clothing after her death			1
they then falsified paperwork to pretend they had been monitoring the pool in a ‘ distasteful ’ bid to cover their tracks			1
but her father , @entity45 , 61 , said his daughter ’s death has left a ‘ scar on our lives ’ and many questions remain unanswered			1
he said : ‘ we are interested in only one thing - to try and understand exactly what happened , there are still a number of questions			2
‘ this is the beginning of an explanation			2
we hope a number of other important things will be addressed in due course			2
’ @entity62 discovered @entity3 floating in the unsupervised pool at @entity6 , near @entity8 ’s @entity64 , as the closed up on the evening of saturday , december 3 , 2011			1
the @entity66 graduate and 200m runner had been seen swimming 25 lengths of breast stroke in a ‘ relaxed manner ’ before the tragedy			2
she was also seen holding her breath under water while timing herself at the health club , which includes a luxury gym and spa			2
but it is not known how long the @entity79 national was unconscious , as the pool was not manned by a lifeguard or adequately monitored by @entity82			2
@entity62 dragged her out of the water and desperately tried to revive her and she was rushed to @entity84 and @entity85 where she was pronounced dead			2
an investigation found ‘ serious shortcomings in the management of risks connected with swimming activity at the club ’			1
prosecutor @entity92 said there were a catalogue of errors and anomalies in risk assessments dating back to 2009			0
he told @entity98 that ‘ the risks were entirely foreseeable ’ and staff failed to check the pool every 30 minutes			1
documents on @entity82 checks were then falsified on the day of the tragedy by unknown staff members in a ‘ distasteful ’ bid to cover their tracks			0
mr @entity92 , who represented @entity7 and @entity108 , said : ‘ there were no recorded checks at all on the day			1
‘ we say there was deliberate falsification of the records to make it seem as though checks , which had not been done , were done			0
’ an investigation found staff had not been properly briefed on potential risk			2
there were also no signs to inform visitors the pool was unsupervised			2
@entity62 failed to ensure @entity3 filled in a customer questionnaire and were forced to search her belongings to find her identification			1
fining the club £ 100,000 and ordering them to pay almost £ 32,000 costs , judge @entity127 said : ‘ the first thing that must be said is a word of sympathy for those who grieve for a young life needlessly lost			0
‘ a fine can not be any measure of the value of life that has been lost			0
‘ it ’s impossible to demonstrate the corporate faults of @entity6 caused this dreadful death so i must punish them not for causing that harm			1
‘ but i must punish them for the culpability they have , the blame they must bear , for failures to make proper assessments of risk and to manage that effectively			0
‘ this is a company that generally has a good safety record but it ’s equally clear in relation to the premises where this event happened , the picture is entirely different			0
’ ' the risks were entirely foreseeable ' : prosecutor @entity92 said there were a catalogue of errors and anomalies in risk assessments at the @entity166 branch in @entity7 dating back to 2009 @entity3 , who lived with her family at their £ 1m home in @entity170 , @entity8 , switched careers from modelling to finance and had a job at @entity174 , the world ’s biggest hedge fund			1
she was working in the client advisory group at @entity177 , which was bought by @entity174 for £ 1.1billion in 2010			0
prior to that she worked as an analyst for investment management firm , @entity180 , which has offices in @entity8 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184			0
she had been on the books of @entity186 in @entity187 where she was described her as ‘ a great girl ’ who was loved by staff			0
@entity192 , for @entity6 , said the business deeply regretted the tragedy , adding that an ‘ apology counts for very little in the circumstances			1
’ he told the court : ' the findings of the investigation , damaging and embarrassing as they are , are out of corporate character for the business			0
‘ no one thought this was a swimming pool that required constant supervision and it demonstrably did not			2
’ he said staff have been sacked in @entity7 venue and pools across all 112 @entity6 clubs now have ‘ constant poolside supervision ’			1
a @entity6 spokesman said : ' @entity3 ’s family and friends have our deepest sympathies for this tragic incident			1
' health and safety is of paramount importance in our clubs and with our staff			0
following an extensive investigation by the @entity224 , as well as one by @entity6 , there has not been any suggestion that @entity3 ’s tragic death was related to the health and safety standards at our @entity7 club			1
' @entity231 guidance , it is not a requirement to have a dedicated lifeguard on duty at the @entity7 pool			1
' however , the safety of our members is of primary importance which is why we took the decision in 2012 to exceed the requirements of @entity242 guidance and have a dedicated lifeguard on duty at all times at every one of our pools			0
' speaking after the hearing , @entity3 ’s sister , @entity247 , 31 , said : ‘ it just seems so unreal			1
we are just trying to work out how this could possibly happen			0
‘ it makes it very hard to find closure			0
we are constantly asking , ‘ what if ? ’ and wondering if things could have been changed			0
‘ it ’s out of our control , there is information we do n’t have access to , to get the answers we need			0
’ describing her younger sister she said : ‘ to me , she was bright , very bubbly , energetic , always someone who would stand out			0
‘ she was very elegant , stylish and was always smiling			0
’ standing with his wife @entity266 , 59 , mr @entity265 added : ‘ we are a very close family and life is not the same			0
it ’s a scar on our lives			0
