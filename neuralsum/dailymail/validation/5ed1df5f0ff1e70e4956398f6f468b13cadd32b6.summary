@entity2 lacked a leader in the first half , prompting @entity12 to bring @entity13 on at half - time , and @entity0 handed him the armband , as per			1
no sooner had @entity13 put it on his left bicep than he had to give it back , as he was sent off after just 38 seconds , and his deputy led @entity2 in their first @entity21 defeat of 2015			1
@entity0 had a tough afternoon as captain as @entity23 inflicted his first defeat as skipper @entity13 receives a red card after just 38 seconds in the second half after coming off the bench the sent off @entity13 throws the captain 's armband to @entity0 after being sent off early in the second half @entity0 gets the armband back after relinquishing it to @entity13 for just 38 seconds of the second half it was in june 2012 that @entity0 received criticism , namely from @entity35 , after being selected in @entity37 's squad in place of the injured @entity39			1
' if @entity0 got in , ' @entity35 wrote , ' any @entity40 not currently in the squad has to feel aggrieved			0
' sir @entity42 echoed that in 2013 , writing in his book that the midfielder ran from the knees			0
@entity0 is a different animal these days , however			0
@entity47 deems his transformation ' truly unbelievable ' , while @entity37 manager @entity49 calls it ' meteoric '			0
he has grown into a leader and was preferred in the starting xi to @entity13 - the man that scored twice and celebrated by kissing the camera at @entity55 in march 2014			2
yet that authority was absent amid a dire first 45 minutes			0
@entity23 , with @entity57 on the bench , were all over the team that had not been beaten in the @entity21 since december 14			2
by the 20th minute , @entity2 had one shot to their name - an effort from @entity63 that never troubled @entity64			1
the visitors had 64.8 per cent possession , too			0
one - sided , to say the least			0

it was n't working against @entity87 's quite brilliant team , and a change was needed			0
@entity2 had lost the four previous games in the @entity21 when trailing by half - time , and @entity13 emerged from the tunnel , kitted with the captain 's armband already on			1
his stamp on @entity95 meant they would be the underdogs for some 44 minutes , and @entity0 could sense his unbeaten record was about to end			2
@entity2 , to their credit , battled like a team that had not been beaten since late 2014			2
yet it was too little , too late , even after @entity63 gave them a glimpse of hope			0
that goal in the 69th minute was their first shot on target , but they could not find a second			1
@entity0 , then , has become @entity13 's natural replacement , and will be required for the next three games against @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 in his absence			2
@entity2 captain @entity13 's stamp on @entity95 saw him sent off at @entity74 after just 38 seconds @entity13 gave the armband back to @entity0 as he was sent off against @entity2 's great rivals united @entity13 's heat map against @entity23 as @entity2 failed to get into the @entity118 race			1
