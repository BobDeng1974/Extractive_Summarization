the @entity0 , @entity0 , is attempting to regain control of a spaceship that is spinning out of control in orbit			1
@entity6 - @entity5 appears to have suffered a major malfunction moments after launch at 3:09 am edt ( 07:09 gmt ) from @entity9			1
it was due to dock with the @entity11 six hours after take off , but that plan has now been ' indefinitely abandoned '			1
orbital parameters were due to be sent from a @entity25 @entity24 , allowing for a eight ' rendevous burns ' to be performed over the next five hours of flight			0
but , once @entity6 had arrived on orbit , only confirmation of its solar array deployment and some of the navigational antennas were made			0
meanwhile , @entity14 's @entity22 reported that a video camera on @entity6 showed it to be spinning at a ' rather significant rate			0
' @entity0 ' problems began shortly after a @entity25 @entity37 rocket launched the progress resupply vehicle			1

' the dizzying footage , which was taken from the @entity6 spacecraft , shows the @entity49 and sun moving in and out of the frame			2
' almost immediately after spacecraft separation , a series of telemetry problems were detected with the @entity6 , ' @entity17 said during a televised broadcast from @entity14 's @entity22			2
' no confirmation of navigational antenna deploy or of the pressurisation of the manifold system for the propulsion system on the spacecraft was received			1
' @entity25 spacecraft , including those used to send astronauts to the @entity11 , recently have acquired the capability to take a more direct six - hour route to the orbiting outpost			1
but they still have the option of the longer , traditional route lasting two days			0
' the crew on board the @entity11 has pressed ahead with maintenance work today as well as biomedical experiment activities , ' said @entity17			2
@entity0 ' problems began shortly after a @entity25 soyuz 2 - @entity37 rocket launched the latest progress resupply vehicle to the @entity11 ' almost immediately after spacecraft separation , a series of telemetry problems were detected with the @entity6 , ' @entity17 said during a televised broadcast from @entity14 's @entity22 @entity0 will try to make contact with the spacecraft tonight as it makes another series of passes over @entity25 ground stations			1
docking with the @entity11 has been abandoned it was unclear how long @entity6 could keep orbiting the @entity49 while @entity25 flight controllers tried to stabilise the craft and restore the system that allows them to send and receive data			1
@entity0 will try to make contact with the spacecraft tonight as it makes another series of passes over @entity25 ground stations			1
because of the loss of connection , the flight controllers were unable to confirm the deployment of the navigational antennas needed for docking , a duty officer at @entity25 's @entity22 said			0
progress is carrying about 2.5 tons of cargo , including fuel , equipment , oxygen and food , to the space station , which currently has a six - person crew from @entity25 , the @entity108 and @entity109			2
the dizzying footage ( pictured ) , which was taken from the @entity6 spacecraft , shows the @entity49 and sun moving in and out of the frame the spacecraft was scheduled to dock with the @entity11 six hours after take off , but that plan has now been ' indefinitely abandoned '			1
pictured a cargo ship in the same family , @entity118 , as seen from the @entity11 ( right ) during docking @entity6 - @entity5 appears to have suffered a major malfunction moments after launch at 3:09 a.m. edt ( 07:09 gmt ) from the @entity122 in @entity9 ' both the @entity25 and @entity124 segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight , @entity14 said in a statement			1
the cargo ship also is delivering a copy of the @entity131 , the banner raised over the @entity132 in @entity133 by victorious @entity135 soldiers in 1945			0
@entity25 is planning extensive celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the victory over @entity139 in @entity140 @entity14 is now having to rely on a single cargo shipper , @entity142			0
its other supplier , @entity143 , is still grounded following a launch explosion last october at @entity145			0
the potential loss of an entire load of supplies on @entity6 is a serious blow to the @entity11			2

@entity6 - @entity162 suffered a *glitch* moments after launch this morning
@entity0 says problem is with its antenna and propulsion system
spacecraft was scheduled to dock with the @entity11 today to deliver food
plan is ' indefinitely abandoned ' as @entity25 *scrambles* to gain control
