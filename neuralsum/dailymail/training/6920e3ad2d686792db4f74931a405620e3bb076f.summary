paramedics have been told to ring ahead before taking patients to an @entity2 struggling to cope after the closure of departments at two nearby hospitals			1
in the latest blow for health bosses who claimed their massive hospital reorganisation programme would improve care , the @entity6 has put out the warning over patients being taken to @entity13 in @entity14			1
two weeks ago , @entity15 revealed that the same hospital was experiencing the longest waits in the country following the closure of casualty units at @entity24 ’s @entity22 and @entity23 hospitals			1
a spokesman for @entity6 confirmed the ‘ call ahead ’ arrangement was now in place , saying : ‘ we are working with the hospital , so before crews go directly to @entity13 , they need to call our control room			1
they are then advised if that is appropriate			0
’ it is the only @entity24 hospital with such an arrangement			1
according to official guidelines , ambulances should have to wait no more than 15 minutes outside @entity50 to drop off patients , but at a meeting last week , @entity13 executives admitted this was exceeded hundreds of times at the site in september alone			1
crews had to wait because there was either no room in @entity2 to take the patients , or there were no staff free to care for them			2
the waiting not only affects patients already in the ambulances , but also ties up crews urgently needed elsewhere			0
the @entity15 has revealed that @entity13 has been experiencing the longest waits in the country in september , ambulances had to wait outside @entity13 for more than half an hour on 179 occasions			2
of those , 30 patients had to wait more than an hour			0
@entity74 leader @entity73 said his worst fears about the effects of closing local a&es were coming true			0
‘ immediate action needs to be taken to resolve this as we are talking about life - and - death emergency treatment			1
our residents deserve the best healthcare and we need to understand why the reconfiguration of local health services has been botched so badly			0
’ the @entity15 has campaigned for two years to keep @entity50 open nationwide , pointing out the problems that health bosses frequently gloss over			0
meanwhile , more than 20 health chiefs from @entity24 have just flown to the @entity89 on a week - long ‘ fact - finding ’ mission – at a cost of more than £ 5,000 a head			2
the taxpayer - funded trip to @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 began yesterday , with 22 officials due to visit ‘ innovative organisations renowned for excellent community care and partnership models ’ , according to an official briefing			0
@entity103 , @entity104 mp for @entity23 , said : ‘ people will see it as extraordinary that during an @entity2 crisis , senior management are jetting off on a jolly			0
