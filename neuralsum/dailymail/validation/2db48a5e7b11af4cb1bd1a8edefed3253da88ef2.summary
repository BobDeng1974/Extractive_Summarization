a powdered alcohol intended to be mixed up into drinks has gained approval from a federal regulator			1
the product , called @entity5 , had received the greenlight from the @entity7 briefly last year before the bureau backtracked and said the label approvals had been given in error			1
on wednesday , bureau spokesman @entity11 told @entity12 the issues were resolved and that four varieties of @entity5 were approved			2
but @entity11 noted that states can also regulate alcohol sales in their borders			2
dry booze : a brand of powdered alcohol has been approved by the @entity7			1
the maker of @entity5 hopes to start selling the product by summer			1
a few of their flavors of powdered alcohol seen above the approval is a step forward for a small company whose product plans have already sparked controversy			1
several states have already moved to ban powdered alcohol , including lawmakers in @entity36 who last month advanced legislation to temporarily halt its sale			1
that bill has since morphed to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it gets federal approval			1
concerns have included abuse by minors , the potential to snort the powder and whether @entity5 's light weight would make it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks			2
@entity5 would come in a pouch , with water being added to the powder inside for the equivalent of an alcoholic drink			0
a statement on @entity5 's website says the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer			1
@entity5 founder @entity62 noted the approval of his products in an email early wednesday morning , and said in a subsequent email that pricing has n't yet been determined			0
' we are n't commenting on production or distribution at this time , ' he wrote			0
the four products that have been approved include powdered versions of a cosmopolitan , a margarita , vodka and rum			0
@entity62 added that he expects another @entity5 product — @entity77 — should also be ' approved shortly			2
' previously , @entity62 had said he came up with the idea for @entity5 because he wanted a way to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to lug around heavy bottles			0
@entity11 said the @entity7 regularly reaches out to the @entity84 to get determinations on whether a product might be considered ' adulterated			0
' if the @entity84 says the product is n't adulterated , he said the bureau 's evaluation centers on whether labels accurately reflect what 's in the product			0
' potential for abuse is n't grounds for us to deny a label , ' @entity11 said .			0
