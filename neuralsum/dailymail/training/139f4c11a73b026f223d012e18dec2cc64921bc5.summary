a mother has described the torment of having a son with severe adhd , admitting that if he were an animal , she would have him put down			1
@entity6 has four children aged 25 , 23 , 19 and 10 and astonishingly , not only have they all been diagnosed with the behavioural disorder , but she too was told she had it in her mid-forties			1
but it is her youngest child @entity13 , 10 , who suffers with the most extreme symptoms of the condition as well as severe learning disabilities , subjecting @entity6 to daily violent attacks			1
she said that because she is his mother , and not a pet owner , she must put up with it			1
scroll down for the video @entity6 's son @entity13 suffers with adhd and severe learning disabilities			1
she said that his unpredictability makes life difficult and sometimes dangerous , as he subjects her to daily , violent attacks @entity6 explained that she is the main target of his frustration and that if @entity13 , who has the mental age of a two - year - old , were her husband they would have divorced by now			1
she added that people should not judge her for her comments until they have heard her story			0
@entity6 said that she used the example of putting a dog down because she has a member of the family who went through the traumatic experience of having their dog euthanised after they could not control its violence			1
' it was a horrendous traumatic experience for the whole family			0
they worked really , really , hard and did everything they could possibly do for [ the dog ]			1
' they spent lots of money and put lots of effort in and ultimately they had the choice to have her put down			2
' i do n't liken @entity13 and the dog exactly but there is a choice			1
when you have a dog that behaves [ violently ] and might attack you any minute , you have a choice			2
' i would n't be without @entity13 but [ i was trying to make the point ] that when you 're the mother of a child like @entity13 there is no choice			1
there is n't a refuge for battered mums - you have to get on with it			2
@entity6 says that although much of the time @entity13 ( pictured ) is ' gorgeous ' , he attacks her at least once a day , often scratching , punching and biting when she goes to give him a cuddle @entity6 made the startlingly frank comments on @entity76 's @entity75			1
her oldest son was diagnosed with @entity22 when he was ten			2
before then people excused his behaviour as ' just being a boy '			0
@entity6 said : ' it was a relief [ when he was diagnosed ] because he was n't just being naughty			1
' she then went on to recognise the same traits in her other children			2
@entity6 said she loves her son dearly but that unlike pet owners , mothers of disabled children do not have a choice about their situation @entity6 added that her late diagnosis of @entity22 has helped her to relate to her children and ultimately to cope with her situation			1
she said : ' if you 've got an @entity22 mind it 's difficult to to understand those who do n't have an @entity22 mind			0
' but at times she says it has been very difficult to cope , especially when all four children were little			1
her first marriage broke down in the mid-nineties but in 2002 she remarried			0
@entity6 , who had always wanted to be a mother , said she had n't expected to have any more children			1
she added that she knew that @entity13 would have problems from very early on : ' you could tell from the scans that there would be something wrong , but we did n't know what			1
he was developing very slowly and was tiny			0
' @entity13 was delivered by caesarean section at 38 weeks and weighed just 3lb 11oz when he was born			1
from then on he developed very slowly , both physically and mentally			0
due to the strain that @entity13 's problems put on her marital relationship , @entity6 's second marriage broke down in 2008 and the couple divorced			1
@entity6 said that she grieved for @entity13 when he was diagnosed with adhd and severe learning difficulties			1
' you do n't love your child any less but it 's a bit like going on holiday and not arriving in the place you expected			0
it 's a lovely place , but not what you expected			0
' @entity6 went on to explain that 99 per cent of the time @entity13 is adorable but that for that one per cent of the time he is violent and unpredictable			1
' and i think most parents would say same thing			2
there are two sides to him			0
the biggest problem is the unpredictability			2
@entity6 ( right ) made her shocking admission on @entity76 's @entity75 , speaking to @entity137 and @entity138 ( left ) about living with a child suffering with severe learning disabilities and @entity22 ' he can be gorgeous all day and then i can squat down to give him a cuddle and he might bite me or scratch me or knock my glasses off or punch me			1
' at least every day i get punched in the face			2
' but @entity6 explained you ca n't approach @entity13 as he is going to attack him and must still cuddle him ' you have to go in expecting a cuddle			1
' @entity6 said that sounds tend to trigger @entity13 's violent outbursts , with modem hand dryers being the main culprit			1
' simply changing routine can cause him to become upset but sometimes it can be nothing , ' she added			0
@entity6 , who once worked part - time in an office , but has since dedicated herself to working as @entity13 's full - time carer , says she thinks about the future and says that @entity13 's behaviour could go either way			1
' maybe he will learn to express himself better and maybe it will all get better			0
the worst fear is that he wo n't get better and he will be same size as me and do even more damage			0
' @entity6 described the lack of help provided for parents of children with @entity22 and learning difficulties @entity6 went to on to describe the lack of help provided for parents of children with @entity22 and learning difficulties			1
' unfortunately professionals do n't always believe you [ about your situation ] and it can be very difficult to get the level of support needed			2
' when you 're a mum and you tell them you 've tried everything and you 're at your wit 's end , specialists tend to keep offering other things rather than giving level of support needed			2
' ' there is help but you have to fight for it and shout loud and even be seen crying			0
' schools and social workers can help but no one will come along will say to you " you look like you 're having a difficult time - do you need some help ? " ' @entity22 ( @entity22 ) can occur in people of any intellectual ability but many people with @entity22 also have learning difficulties			1
symptoms of @entity22 tend to be first noticed at an early age , and may become more noticeable as a child grows up			0
@entity22 can be a lifelong condition , and many children continue to have symptoms as a teenager and adult			2
young children are naturally active and easily distracted			2
however , if these features are excessive for a child 's age and general developmental level , and affecting their daily life , they may indicate adhd			2
@entity22 is normally diagnosed between the ages of three and seven , although in some cases it may not be until much later			0
it is more commonly diagnosed in boys			0
the exact cause of @entity22 is not known , although research shows that it tends to run in families			0
studies have also shown that there may be differences in the way the brain works in people with @entity22			0
there is no cure for @entity22 , but it can be managed with appropriate educational support , advice and support for parents and the individual , and medication if necessary			1
' i want to get more help so we do n't reach crisis point			0

i know so many other mums who are at their wit 's end			0
luckily we have each other			0
