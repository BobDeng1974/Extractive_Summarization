by @entity0 published : 12:24 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 03:31 est , 29 august 2013 he 's famous for championing @entity3 design and for being a fan of a well cut suit but it seems @entity7 has simpler tastes when it comes to skincare			1
instead of facials and @entity12 , @entity7 , 33 , says he relies on rosehip oil after being handed a bottle during a shoot in @entity16			1
' i take 90 - odd flights a year so my skin is constantly dehydrated , ' the model revealed			2
' an @entity16 make - up artist gave me her rosehip oil and it just seemed to do wonders			0
' beauty secret : @entity7 ( pictured with @entity25 ) says rosehip oil is the secret of beautiful skin dermatologist @entity29 says more men want good skin and will use products like @entity34 's oil ( above ) the oil , which is sold by @entity16 organic beauty brand @entity34 and costs £ 18 , contains a high concentration of @entity39 nine , six and three , as well as essential fatty acids - all of which make it intensely hydrating			1
while @entity7 might be unusual in his taste for rosehip oil , male grooming in general is becoming increasingly popular , with 54 per cent of men feeling under pressure to take care of their skin , according to a recent study			1
men now spend more than more than ever on looking good every year , while 33 per cent admit to using hair removal products , nine per cent saying they wear foundation and 11 per cent applying fake tan			1
interestingly , the last figure appears to be borne out by the beautiful @entity3 2013 report - an annual survey of 2,600 salon beauty professionals commissioned by @entity59			0
despite @entity7 's popularity with the ladies , perma - tanned @entity61 @entity60 was found to be the celebrity behind the grooming efforts of more than a fifth of male clients			2
fans : @entity69 and @entity70 both use @entity72 products to keep their skin lovely ' what i have noticed is that men no longer are afraid of saying " i care about my looks			2
" , ' explains @entity79 dermatologist @entity29 , who counts @entity69 and @entity70 among his fans			1
' they want to look hot for their wives , girlfriends , or partners in life			0
men have been made aware of the negative consequences that can happen if they do n’t take care of their skin – it can become dry or uncomfortable , leathery , or sun damaged			2
so , they take pride and invest in taking care of their skin			0
he added : ' i always tell my male clients to keep their skin care routine simple so that they do n’t feel overwhelmed			0
' one important aspect of their simple routine is to invest in at least one or two anti-aging products for night time use , since skin is at rest and the regenerative powers are working in top gear			0
' i do feel that it is important that a man does not aim to look like a male @entity111 doll – it ’s all about natural , healthy skin with flexibility and a good tone – expression lines look good in a man ’s face			0
