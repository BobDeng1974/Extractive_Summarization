trolls : cycling hero sir @entity1 has been subjected to vile online abuse after making comments about the prospect of @entity6 independence @entity7 legend sir @entity1 has been subjected to offensive abuse from nationalist campaigners after he raised concerns about @entity6 independence			1
the @entity6 cycling hero was branded a ‘ bigoted @entity12 ’ , a ‘ t * * * * * ’ , a ‘ creep ’ and an ‘ imbecile ’ by the online army of so - called ‘ @entity16 ’			1
the disgraceful remarks have sparked fury , with a @entity20 minister calling on @entity21 to take action amid fears of ‘ lasting damage to damage @entity6 ’s reputation ’			1
sir @entity1 has won legions of fans across the globe with his passion and professionalism on the track			0
but @entity20 ’s greatest ever @entity33 became an enemy for the @entity16 after he warned that @entity6 athletes will find it harder to challenge on the world stage if the country becomes independent			1
the six - time gold medal winner explicitly refused to reveal his voting intention , insisting he did not want to get involved in the ‘ hornet ’s nest ’			1
but that did not stop the online abuse from pro-independence supporters who use @entity45 and news websites to attack unionists			1
twitter user @entity48 – whose profile picture includes the @entity51 logo - wrote : ' i ’ve always said @entity1 is a bigoted anti-scot			2
' @entity53 wrote on the micro-blogging site : ' @entity55 off @entity1 you soft s * *			0
' others attacked sir @entity1 ’s upbringing and his schooling at @entity62 ’s @entity61 ’s private school			0
one anonymous online comment stated : ' schooled at an expensive @entity62 private establishment where pupils were expected to sing @entity66 on a regular basis - maybe it got engrained ? ' concerns : gold medal - winning cyclist sir @entity1 warned @entity6 athletes would find it harder to compete on the world stage as an independent nation last night , @entity6 office minister @entity74 said : ' the negative and personal tone of the attacks on sir @entity1 is shameful and casts the referendum debate in a poor light			1
' this could deliver lasting damage to damage @entity6 ’s reputation abroad and lead to unnecessary hostility here at home			2
everyone has a responsibility to guard against the independence debate leaving scars that last well beyond [ next year ’s referendum in ] september next year			0
' i believe it would be helpful if the first minister and the @entity93 were explicit in their condemnation of those trying to shout down the views of sir @entity1 and others			2
the debate on our future must be open to all			0
' the row comes just weeks after comedian @entity104 revealed she was reduced to tears by online trolls after she cracked jokes about the independence referendum			0
@entity110 leader @entity109 also faced anti-english abuse from a largely pro-independence crowd of protesters on a recent visit to @entity62			2
@entity116 leader @entity115 said : ' first comedienne @entity104 , then @entity109 , now @entity7 great sir @entity1 - the nationalists seek to silence everyone they disagree with			0
if this is the kind of @entity6 we 'll get with independence i am sure even more will reject the nationalists ' plans			0
' when i stood up for @entity109 's right to speak i did so irrespective of his views			0
the same applies to @entity1 and anyone else 's right to free speech			0
' pressure : a @entity20 minister has called on @entity51 leader @entity21 , left , to condemn the attacks on sir @entity1 , pictured right with wife @entity132 , to ensure the debate surrounding independence is respectful speaking on @entity136 on tuesday , sir @entity1 said : ' i 've said numerous times how proud i am to be @entity6 and how proud i have been to compete for @entity20 too , and i do n't think these two things necessarily have to be mutually exclusive			1
' discussing the prospect of a separate @entity7 team in an independent @entity6 , he said : ' it would not be quite as simple as just saying , ' there is a @entity6 athlete , they have won a gold medal , therefore that 's a medal for @entity6 '			1
most of the athletes have had to move to facilities which are often outwith @entity6			2
' last night , an @entity51 spokesman said : ' @entity1 is one of @entity6 ’s greatest olympians and we are all proud of his achievements			1
we join @entity115 in condemning these comments regardless of what party political persuasion they come from			0
online abuse has no place in the political debate			1
' it ’s a matter of public record that [ deputy @entity51 leader ] @entity164 has been sent death threats on @entity45 , a posting on the no campaign ’s facebook page talked about firing bullets into @entity51 leaders , appalling remarks about @entity21 's dad were made on a @entity173 website , and the abuse directed at @entity104 was disgraceful			1
' all of it must stop , because the referendum debate needs to be a positive one with the people about what @entity6 can achieve as an independent country			2
