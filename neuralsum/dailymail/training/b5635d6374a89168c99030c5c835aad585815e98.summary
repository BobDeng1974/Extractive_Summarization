by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 17:56 est , 27 august 2013 @entity1 is fighting chicken wings with french fries as the fast food giants ' battle for the @entity7 buck intensifies			2
just a day after @entity8 's announced plans for a new chicken item dubbed ' @entity11 , ' @entity1 has come out with a revolutionary ' @entity12 ' for a dollar - to compete head on with its rival 's lucrative @entity14			1
@entity8 's will roll out the @entity11 nationally as a limited - time offer through november , selling the bone - in chicken wings as three , five and 10 pieces , starting at $ 2.99			2
the morsels will come with nine different sauces to choose from including @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			0
meanwhile , the ' @entity12 ' will launch on september 1 and will be available through the fall			0
want fries with that ? @entity1 to offer @entity12 for just $ 1 to compete with @entity8 's @entity14 @entity1 is focusing more on cheaper items after @entity8 's aggressive push for its @entity14 , which brings in the most cash of all its offerings			1
the burger , which clocks in at 360 calories and 19 grams of fat , is a relatively novel offering , but does n't require any extra investment from @entity1 ; it 's basically a standard beef patty topped with four of the chain 's french fries			1
the offering comes as fast - food chains jump through hoops to get customers through their doors , in large part by heavily promoting their cheapest eats			0
@entity8 's has stepped up advertising for its @entity14 , which now features its @entity47 and a more substantial @entity48 , which has two patties and a slice of cheese			2
that forced @entity1 and @entity53 's to adjust their tactics earlier this year to stress value more clearly as well			1
@entity1 , for example , has offered any two sandwiches for $ 5 and a @entity58 for $ 1.29			0
mighty wings : @entity8 's ' might wings , ' pictured , will be added to the chain 's chicken menu immediately it 's not clear whether the strategy will pay off for the chains , or what impact it could have on wearing away at profit margins over the long term			2
but in the latest quarter , @entity1 said its sales at @entity7 restaurants open at least a year slipped 0.5 per cent			1
@entity53 's reported an anemic 0.4 per cent rise , while @entity8 's reported a 1 per cent increase for @entity75 restaurants			1
the metric is an important indicator of health because it strips out the impact of newly opened and closed locations			0
other chains , by contrast , are faring better			0
@entity21 reported a 3.4 per cent increase and @entity84 said the figure rose 9 per cent .			0

the @entity12 clocks 360 calories and 19 grams of fat
comes a day after @entity8 's ' @entity90 ' were revealed
in the latest quarter , @entity1 's sales at @entity7 restaurants open at least a year slipped 0.5 ***%***
@entity53 's reported an 0.4 ***%*** rise , while @entity8 's reported a 1 ***%*** increase
