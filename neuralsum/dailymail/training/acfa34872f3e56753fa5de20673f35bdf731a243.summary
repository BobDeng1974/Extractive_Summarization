by @entity0 @entity2 councilman @entity1 wants every citizen and teacher armed			1
the full city council has agreed to debate the bill next month			1
officials in a small @entity9 town want to make sure every head of household has a firearm and knows how to use it , and they want to give school teachers training with guns too			1
@entity2 councilman @entity1 first proposed an ordinance requiring a gun in every household in the town of 1,000			1
the rest of the council scoffed at making it a requirement , but they unanimously agreed to move forward with an ordinance " recommending " the idea			1
the council also approved funding to offer concealed firearms training friday to the 20 teachers and administrators at the local elementary school			1
' it sends a statement that criminals better think twice , ' @entity1 told @entity0 on tuesday			1
' if a teacher would have had a concealed weapon in @entity38 , i think the death loss would have been fewer			1
if sane , trained people had guns , they could have shot back			2
' @entity38 is the school in @entity44 , @entity45 , where a man killed 20 children and six adults in a rampage in december			2
the measure , which will go before the full council in february for further review , seems to have the support of the council 's five members and many residents in the farming community about 90 miles south of @entity58			2
but school administrators do n't think arming teachers is wise , and they are not encouraging teachers to participate in friday 's training			2
' the more guns you have in the school , the more dangerous it is , ' said @entity67 , superintendent of the @entity68			2
councilman @entity69 said making guns in every house mandatory was too much , but he agrees the town would be safer if everyone was armed			2
with only a part - time police force , he said , response time is not like it is in a big city			2
' if a person is able to take care of themselves for a while , it would probably be a good thing , ' @entity69 said			0
police lead students out of @entity38 last month after 20 children were fatally shot			0
@entity1 said mass shootings such as this would be reduced if teachers had guns the community is still reeling from the double - murder on @entity92 2011 of an elderly couple in nearby @entity94			0
@entity1 said what used to be a peaceful , quiet town has been sullied by increasing criminal activity			0
thefts of metal for scrap and other property also have become a problem , councilman @entity98 said			0
' we are kind of tired of people breaking in and taking stuff , ' said @entity98 , explaining why he voted to urge every house to have a gun			0
@entity109 , a coal miner and father of four girls who lives in @entity2 , backs the council 's measure			1
' people think small towns are a good place to live , ' @entity109 said			0
' but there is more crime and drugs than you can imagine			0
' @entity109 , who owns 78 guns he keeps locked in a safe , does n't want teachers to act as police officers			0
he said some kids are " hooligans " and could overpower teachers for the guns			0
the legislation would arm and train every citizen with a gun , such as this one sisters @entity131 and @entity133 , however , say arming teachers would make them feel better about sending their children to the @entity136			1
the co-owners of the town 's coffee shop , @entity140 , said most @entity2 residents keep guns for hunting , leaving only a handful without weapons			1
@entity2 leaders say they got the idea from a city in @entity149 that passed a similar law			1
in 1982 , @entity151 , @entity149 , made headlines by requiring heads of households to own a gun and ammunition			0
on its website , @entity151 boasts that its burglary rate declined after the law took effect			1
but @entity161 does n't believe having more armed teachers would necessarily prevent or mitigate the damage in mass shootings			0
@entity9 law allows teachers to have concealed weapon in classrooms , but the district does n't advocate for that , @entity161 said			1
' by bringing weapons into school , are we creating more problems than we are solving ? ' he asked			0
' it could create a new problem			0
we do n't want to deal with that problem			0

law would arm every head of household and teacher in @entity2
