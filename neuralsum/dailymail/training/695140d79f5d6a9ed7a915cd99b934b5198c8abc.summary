a customer was so frustrated with the dreadful shopping experience he has endured at an east @entity3 @entity2 he set up a picture blog mocking the farcical conditions			1
@entity6 , a pr professional , ranted over food being left on the floor , missing or out - of - date goods , non-existent staff and a faulty alarm ruining his sleep at the branch in @entity14 , @entity15 , and posted pictures to hammer home his exasperation			1
' the worst place on @entity20 ' came into existence at 1am on tuesday while mr @entity6 , 30 , was being kept awake by the store 's alarm , which was going off every 30 minutes			1
haphazard : trolleys block aisles and food is dumped on the floor in these pictures it details goods dumped in busy walkways , chilled food left on normal shelves , unhelpful staff and a complete lack of the most basic produce			1
he said : ' i ’ve been taking pictures in there for a few months because even though i ’m a big fan of @entity2 i think this one store is letting them down			1
' the burglar alarm was going off every three minutes again , i could n’t sleep and had nothing better to do so i set it up as a bit of a vent			2
' stock control : empty shelves were a frequent problem for mr @entity6			2
someone wrote : ' @entity2 , every little ( very , very little ) helps ' shelves lie empty while goods are dumped on the floor and basic essentials often run out his posts are all in capital letters and include observations such as : ' @entity59			1
at 6:30 on a friday night			2
' @entity61 kicked a bag of @entity63			2
there was no one to complain to			0
' other peeved customers also joined in with their own experiences			0
one posted : ' it ’s like they looked at the all the cliches about the demographic of an east @entity3 postcode and thought , yes we ’ll stock out of date turkey twizzlers and sell stuff that has been kicked around the floor and no one will notice			1
' well , hopefully the ceo of @entity2 will notice now			1
' meal deal anyone ? : @entity81 nestles with sandwiches in the @entity2			1
@entity83 , @entity6 , who started the blog out of sheer frustration banished : the comments read : ' @entity88 had been ostracised by the others for being @entity90 ' and ' as usual , @entity2 have kindly taken the liberty of deciding my diet / hunger strike starts today ' one shopper lamented : ' i went in for potatoes but all they had was this long thing			1
i do n't know what it is but i 'm going back tonight to see if any further reductions have been made ' another said : ' i tried to buy carrots the other day for carrot cake at about 2pm , could n’t find any			0
' decided to investigate further and look at the tags to see where the carrots normally live			0
none of the bins had carrot tags on them			0
' eight different varieties of onion , no carrots ? ' the blog soon went viral and @entity2 bosses quickly got in touch to assure mr @entity6 they would amend the situation			1
mr @entity6 told the @entity119 : ' i put it out on @entity121 and @entity122 and did n’t really think much more of it , but because of the industry i work in it got picked up and one thing led to another			0
' a @entity2 spokesperson said : ' we are aware of the blog and agree this store has not met our high standards			1
we are working with the store to make sure we offer the best possible service for our customers			2
' ' they ’ve started making @entity135 to entertain the punters when they ca n’t find a single thing they were shopping for … a lethal @entity139			0
the security guard is the umpire			0
' ' someone filled a basket with pickled onions and left it in the middle of the aisle			0
it was there the whole time i was in there … no one did anything about it until a @entity153 came and pushed it next to the @entity154			0
' ' this is n’t i , robot			0
where are the people ? ! oh , that is right , they ’re running around trying to @entity161 ( self - service ) machines instead of just using the till like @entity163 … @entity164 noticed and dumped their pampers and walked @entity167			2
' ' there is never any spices			0
who is buying all the damned spices ? ! i just want some damn @entity174 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '			0

frustration drove *man* to *chronicle* a @entity178 in @entity3
his blog shows food dumped on floor , a lack of staff and hardly any stock
@entity2 have now *apologised* and *pledged* to overhaul the store
