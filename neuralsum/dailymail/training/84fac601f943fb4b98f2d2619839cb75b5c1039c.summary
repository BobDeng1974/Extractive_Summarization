pilots claim the proposed changes to flying hours and rostered rest periods will put lives at risk by increasing the chances of fatigued fliers falling asleep in the cockpits of packed passenger planes			1
the proposals still face further votes in coming weeks by the full @entity20 and the @entity21 , in which @entity2 ministers have a voice			1
puts lives at risk : @entity2 pilots are celebrating after a @entity4 transport committee rejected plans to impose controversial new flight time rules which they say are unsafe the rules must be backed by both votes to go ahead but air transport experts believe the rejection by the @entity4 ’s @entity32 – by 20 votes to 13 – increases the chances of the new rules being kicked out			1
the @entity36 ( @entity37 ) hailed the committee ’s rejection as a ‘ vote for common sense ’ and called on the @entity2 government and @entity5 ‘ to act to protect the safety of our skies '			1
today , @entity37 published polling evidence and personal testimonials from pilots admitting that both captain and co-pilot fell asleep in the cockpit at the same time			1
it also recorded testimony of a pilot whose over-tired captain nodded - off low over @entity55 as his aircraft came in to land at @entity57			0
last week @entity37 revealed a poll of 500 pilots showing six out of 10 said they had fallen asleep in the cockpit and of those , almost one in three said they woke to find the other pilot was also asleep			1
and one in six had been in the cockpit when both flight crew were asleep			1
a ' vote of common sense ' : the @entity36 ( @entity37 ) published testimonials and evidence from pilots and co-pilots who admitted they had fallen asleep in the cockpit at the same time after the @entity4 vote , @entity37 general secretary @entity73 said : ‘ @entity2 pilots will welcome the @entity76 ’s rejection of the proposed @entity4 cuts to @entity2 flight safety			1
‘ the botched new rules have been rejected by scientists , mps on the @entity2 @entity76 , @entity2 pilots with 40 million hours of flying experience between them and by the public , 90 per cent of whom are concerned that a pilot could be landing their aircraft having been awake for 22hours			1
’ ‘ the commission must now go back to the drawing board and work with pilots and scientists to develop rules on flying time and tiredness that are based on evidence and expert experience			2
‘ pilots will continue to urge @entity2 ministers , @entity5 and the @entity100 to protect the safety of our skies and help pilots make every flight a safe flight			1
’ @entity37 will press @entity2 meps to vote against the proposals in a full session of the @entity20 and for the @entity110 to oppose them in the @entity21			1
it will also press transport ministers in the @entity2 to order an audit of the proposals by an independent group of scientists and medical experts			1
over-tired pilots : @entity37 general secretary @entity73 ( right ) said rejecting to vote was an ' act to protect the safety of our skies ' and @entity122 mp @entity121 ( left ) , who chairs the @entity124 , agrees that the proposed @entity4 changes could endanger air passenger safety today pilots ’ leaders released a damning new dossier of first - hand testimony from jetlagged flight crew admitting to falling asleep in the cockpit – sometimes simultaneously			1
one transatlantic long - haul pilot reported how both he and his captain were asleep at the same time at night and woken only by the aircraft ’s warning alert system			2
he said : ‘ i was taking my turn of 40 minutes controlled rest , in the cruise , crossing the @entity140 on a night flight			0
‘ i was woken after about 20 minutes by a warning sound from the aircraft			0
the captain was awoken at the same time as me			0
it appears that he had also fallen asleep at the same time , the pilot alert system had been ignored and so the aircraft reacted to wake us up			2
’ asleep in the cockpit : in @entity37 testimonies , a pilot admitted his captain fell asleep during the landing approach at @entity55 's @entity57 a captain also admitted being asleep while his co-pilot also slept leaving no one in charge			2
he said : ‘ i have fallen asleep at the controls in command twice			0
on the one occasion my colleague was having a “ controlled rest ”			0
’ another pilot told @entity37 how his captain nodded off low over @entity55 at a ‘ critical ’ stage of the plane ’s landing approach to @entity57			0
as the plane was lined up to head into @entity57 and link with the airport ’s instrument landing system , the co-pilot spoke to his captain to prepare the plane for the manoeuvre , but noted : ‘ the captain did not respond			0
i asked him a second time and shook him at which he woke up			0
’ the pilot said : ‘ he had fallen asleep between taking a radio call from @entity178 [ air traffic control ] and me requesting flap			0
he fell asleep over a distance say of three miles while the aircraft was between 2 - 3,000ft in the @entity55 area			0
after landing the captain signed off fatigued			0
he was signed off by his doctor for a month			0
’ the testimony followed publication by the @entity100 of an incident report from a @entity190 pilot flying an @entity191 saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days but the pair were not asleep simultaneously			2
@entity121 , who chairs the influential all - party @entity124 and is @entity122 mp for @entity197 , said : ‘ i agree with @entity37 ’s concerns that the proposed changes to @entity4 rules could endanger air passenger safety			2
‘ our committee has already warned that the changes could mean pilots landing planes after being awake for 22 hours			2
’ ‘ there is still time for the @entity208 and @entity209 to think again			0
