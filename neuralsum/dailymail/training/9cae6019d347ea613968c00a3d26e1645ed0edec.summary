@entity0 has quit @entity1 - just days after her co-star @entity2 was forced to apologize over a joke about @entity5 star @entity4			1
the lilac - haired star , 30 , has been a fixture on the show since 2011			1
@entity10 confirmed @entity0 's departure on friday with a statement : ' @entity0 is departing @entity10 's @entity1 to pursue other opportunities , and we would like to thank her for her many contributions to the series over the past five years , during which time the show became a hit with viewers			1
however , a source insisted @entity0 's possible departure has nothing to do with the @entity31 row ' @entity1 will return , as scheduled , on friday , march 30th at 9:00 p.m. and no decisions have been made on her replacement , ' the statement went on to explain			1
earlier that day a source told @entity36 : ' @entity0 stayed on the show after the beloved @entity38 passed away , but nothing has been the same since			1
' the chemistry has not been the same between the hosts since the show came back on air and @entity0 knows it 's time to move on			1
' apology : @entity2 was forced to apologize after joking that @entity31 's dreadlocks at the @entity47 would ' smell of patchouli ' or ' weed ' @entity0 fired back on @entity50 after her co-star @entity2 said @entity4 's @entity47 dreadlocks looked like they would ' smell of patchouli ' or ' weed ' on the @entity55 special on monday night			1
she raged : ' @entity56 [ sic ]			0
' however , the source insisted : ' this has nothing to do @entity2			0
@entity4 accepted @entity2 's apology and she 's already moved on to a new hair style ! ' even @entity0 tweeted ' this too shall pass ' and was over it			2
' @entity38 was the mama bear , she stopped all the quarrels and held the show together , even when @entity0 was being testy			1
' when @entity1 returned on air following @entity38 's death , @entity67 was at the helm , with stylist @entity71 brought on board			1
@entity10 execs are now keen to revamp the show before it returns in march			1
@entity0 's bid to leave comes as her dad , rocker @entity76 , waded into the argument with some words of warning for @entity23			1
after the @entity24 host slammed his daughter @entity0 and stood up for pal @entity2 , the star fired back on @entity50			2
' @ @entity83 stop acting like a b * * * *			0
act like a man , ' @entity76 wrote on thursday night			0
' @entity86 or we 'll be going to hospital to get my foot out of your a * *			0
' @entity23 did not respond directly to the @entity95 star 's message , but joked about it a few hours later while discussing the viral photo of a dress that some see as white and gold and others see as blue and black			0
' need to book an opthomologist and a proctologist on @ @entity104 tomorrow			0
for @entity105 and @entity76 's foot , ' he tweeted			0
contrary to reports , @entity23 blasted the suggestion that @entity0 tried to stop @entity2 from making the comment about @entity4 's hair - and that the segment was taped three times			2
as @entity36 has revealed , the joke was actually scripted by @entity1 writers - and was not off the cuff from @entity2			2
words of warning : @entity76 told @entity23 to ' lay off ' his daughter @entity0 on thursday			2
the rock star is pictured with his daughter in november @entity121 : the @entity24 host , seen in november , slammed @entity0 over the @entity124 controversy ' we 'll be going to hospital ' : @entity76 took to @entity50 to fire back at @entity23 seeing the funny side : @entity23 did not respond directly , but joked about the @entity95 frontman 's comment a few hours later the 43 - year - old said he spoke to @entity2 directly and that she denied claims it was filmed more than once - as did the show 's network @entity10			1
' and the @entity0 part ... that never occurred , ' @entity23 went on , adding that he ' doubts ' the two hosts have made amends			2
' how could it be good ? @entity0 threw her under the bus , in my opinion , ' he said			2
@entity23 also added : ' @entity2 is taking the hit for this			0
that joke that @entity2 delivered , it was a written joke			0
which means there were a lot of people involved - and nobody saw racism			0
' @entity155 revealed that the joke about @entity31 's dreadlocks was scripted , and that @entity0 did not speak out against it during filming			1
the following day , she added : ' im giving everyone involved 24 hours to make it right or the world will hear how i really feel			0
@entity165 [ sic ] im not allowed to speak ! ' ' i did not make the @entity166			0
@entity167 [ sic ] staying on the show ! ' shortly afterwards , @entity2 apologised on @entity10 news			2
' i want to apologise for a comment that i made on last night 's @entity1 about @entity31 's hair , ' she said			1
' as you know , @entity1 is a show that pokes fun at celebrities in good spirit , but i do realise that something i said last night did cross the line			2
' sorry : @entity2 issued an apology on @entity10 news on tuesday , which @entity4 graciously accepted threatening to leave : earlier this week @entity0 suggested she would quit the show if @entity2 did n't ' make it right ' ' i just want everyone to know that i did n't intend to hurt anybody , but i learned it 's not my intent that matters , it 's the result			1
and the result is people are offended , including @entity31			0
and that is not ok			0
' @entity4 graciously accepted the apology , saying that she ' appreciates ' it and adding that she is ' glad it was a learning experience '			0
