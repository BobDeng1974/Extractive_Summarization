by @entity0 published : 13:10 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 15:28 est , 23 january 2013 researchers have downloaded @entity3 's sonnets on to synthetic @entity4 in a breakthrough that could lead to major advances in computer storage a genetic storage device has been used to ' download ' all 154 of @entity3 's sonnets on to strands of synthetic dna			1
scientists were then able to decode the information and reproduce the words of the @entity3 with complete accuracy			0
the same technique made it possible to store a 26 second excerpt from @entity19 's ' @entity21 ' speech and a photo of the @entity24 laboratory where the work took place			1
researchers were also able to turn a copy of @entity29 and @entity31 's paper describing the nature of @entity4 into genetic code			1
the landmark study paves the way to storing huge amounts of data using the same method evolved by @entity39 to write the ' @entity40 '			0
theoretically , 100million hours of high definition video could be stored in a cupful of dna - equivalent to every film and tv programme ever created			1
unlike magnetic tape , which degrades within a decade , @entity4 is a hardy material that can last for tens of thousands of years			1
a @entity4 archive also requires no constant supply of electric power , as do hard disks			1
for their experiment , the @entity52 scientists employed a @entity55 - based company to create strands of artificial dna that corresponded to their coding instructions			0
the end result was a small test - tube the size of a little finger containing a tiny amount of dry dusty material			0
this was the dna , which was then ' read ' and decoded to reproduce the original files			0
details of the technique are described today in the journal @entity39			2
five genetic ' letters ' from the genetic code - a , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 - were used to represent the noughts and ones that make up ' bytes ' of digital information			0
for instance , the upper case t in the word ' @entity78 ' from the second line of @entity3 's @entity82 - ' thou art more lovely and more temperate ' - was encoded by the sequence @entity84			2
dr @entity86 , from the @entity87 at the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity24 , said : ' we already know that @entity4 is a robust way to store information because we can extract it from bones of woolly mammoths , which date back tens of thousands of years , and make sense of it			1
currently data centres such as @entity96 's shown here , rely on traditional hard drives			1
however , they could one day be replaced by the dna drives revealed today ' it 's also incredibly small , dense and does not need any power for storage , so shipping and keeping it is easy			1
' we 've created a code that 's error tolerant using a molecular form we know will last in the right conditions for 10,000 years , or possibly longer			1
' as long as someone knows what the code is , you will be able to read it back if you have a machine that can read dna			0
' the scientists crossed a major hurdle by incorporating ' error correction ' similar to that found in devices such as laptops and mobile phones			2
this involved overlapping short strands of dna and independently writing every million - molecule fragment of code four times			0
effectively , three back ups were created for each fragment , greatly reducing the chances of mistakes			2
' you would have to have the same error on four different fragments for it to fail - and that would be very rare , ' said co-author dr @entity133 , also from the @entity87			0
currently the technology is restricted by the length of time it takes to sequence dna and its high cost - around Â£ 8,000 per megabyte of stored material			2
even so , dna - based storage could today be cost effective for archives of several megabytes over long time periods of 600 to 5,000 years , computer models predict			1
ten years from now the rapid development of more efficient , cheaper dna sequencing could make genetic storage a practical possibility for archive life spans of less than 50 years , say the scientists			2
they stressed that the dna used was wholly artificial and different to the genetic molecules of life			0
' the dna we 've created can not be incorporated accurately into the genome ( genetic code ) , ' said dr @entity86			0
' it uses a completely different code			0

same technique also used to store 26 second excerpt from @entity19 's ' @entity21 ' speech
breakthrough could have major *implications* for computer storage with @entity4 hard drives
could lead to drives that can store high definition *version* of every film and tv programme ever created in a *teacup* sized drive
