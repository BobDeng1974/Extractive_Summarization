by @entity0 published : 10:35 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 11:57 est , 10 august 2012 police are hunting the owners of a ' drunk ' dog that clamped its jaws around a cow 's face for ten minutes after its owner goaded it into a violent frenzy			1
the sozzled @entity10 bull terrier brutally attacked the helpless steer , on @entity12 , @entity13 , after it staggered away from its owners - a man and woman , also described as inebriated			1
a fierce tussle ensued as the cow attempted to trample its canine attacker with its hooves in a bid to loosen the iron grip			0
as the dog 's owners simply looked on , a passer by eventually caught the rampaging animal before tying it to a lead he had in his pocket			1
a good graze : the unnamed cow was left with a large gash on its face , but it has been treated and its owner said it is ' well and calm ' now @entity35 want to find the owners after they were called to reports of a dog that ' appeared to be drunk ' attacking a cow on wednesday evening			1
the suspected dog , thought to be called @entity41 , is said to have been baited to attack the cattle which are famous for having roamed the common undisturbed for hundreds of years			1
@entity44 , who owns the cattle , said : ' i think the owners of the dog must not have realised what would happen , but it is stupid , cruel and irresponsible			1
' the steer had lacerations to its face			0
the dog bit one steer ’s leg then attached itself to the other steer ’s face			2
' @entity58 , 30 , who was running on the common when the attack took place , said : ' it was really horrible			0
i thought at first the cows were attacking the dog but then we saw the dog has clamped on to the face of a cow and was just dangling on it for about 10 minutes			1
angry : @entity44 , who owns the cattle , said the owner 's actions were ' stupid , cruel and irresponsible ' ' there was nothing we could do			1
the dog eventually got off and then carried on chasing the cows until it finally fell down with exhaustion			2
' a really brave man came over and managed to get a lead on it			0
i do n’t think the owner even had a lead and he was really drunk			1
' he dragged it up the road because it was exhausted			0
' another witness , who asked not to be named , said the dog was goaded into the attack			1
he said : ' it was disgraceful			0
to get a dog to attack the cows is awful			2
' and @entity96 , chairman of the friends of @entity12 , said : ' there are people on the common who have given drink to dogs in the past			2
' it ’s deplorable but it is a very isolated incident			0
we are very keen on the cows here			0
' the brutal attack happened at about 7pm on wednesday evening in front of a crowd of passersby on @entity12 in @entity13			1
the cow was left with a large gash on its face , but it has been treated and its owner said it is ' well and calm '			1
the injuries to the dog , which witnesses reported was called @entity41 - or @entity121 - was kicked by the cattle , have not been reported to @entity35			1
dangerous dogs ? @entity124 are generally known for their good temperaments , intelligence and fierce loyalty			0
but in the wrong hands , these traits can be manipulated , turning pets into deadly weapons officers want to trace the owners of the dog , believed to be a man and woman , and have released a description			2
a spokesman said : ' the owners were described as a white man and woman			0
' the woman was between about 5ft and 5ft 6in tall , in her 30s , with blonde hair and was wearing a pink top and had an orange jumper tied around her waist			0
' the man was about 5ft 8in tall with dark hair			0
' we are keen to trace the owners and anyone with information should call police on 101			2
the cow was treated by a vet			2
' cattle have been roaming free on picturesque @entity12 for hundreds of years			1
@entity124 are generally known for their good temperaments , intelligence and fierce loyalty			0
but in the wrong hands , these traits can be manipulated , turning pets into deadly weapons			0
the 1991 @entity164 bans four types of fighting dog including the pit bull terrier , but the @entity10 bull terrier is not one of them .			0
