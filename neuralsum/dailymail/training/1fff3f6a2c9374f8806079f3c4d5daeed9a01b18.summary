by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:03 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 07:38 est , 30 april 2013 wives living in small towns and villages get worse divorce settlements than those who split in big cities , according to new research			1
the disparity is so great than growing numbers of women from the north of @entity12 are ‘ racing ’ to have their cases be heard in @entity16 courts			1
lawyers claim there is now a ‘ maintenance map ’ which dictates the generosity of divorce settlements and the frequency of maintenance payments			2
city dwelling ex-wives secured a bigger slice of the cake in divorce cases , research suggests according to the research wives who had their cases heard in provincial courts were less likely to be granted maintenance from their ex-husband in addition to splitting marital assets			1
legal firm @entity35 analysed some 700 cases from the last two years			2
partner @entity38 claims wives from @entity16 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 or @entity43 could expect to receive ongoing financial support from their former spouse			1
but those in smaller towns were told to ‘ stand on their own two feet ’			0
women in cities like @entity42 ( left ) and @entity43 got a better deal than those whose cases were heard in provincial towns , lawyers said she said : ‘ it is a complicated picture which reflects the differing interpretations certain courts appear to place on the needs of wives after divorce			1
‘ courts have an obligation to have a financial clean break between spouses on divorce , if possible			0
if that can not be achieved , they look to meet the immediate needs of a wife for things such as a house from any joint capital which couples might have built up as well as providing ongoing maintenance			2
‘ @entity77 law is designed to be discretionary , so that it can be flexible enough to produce outcomes suiting the particular needs of individuals			0
that also means there can be great variety in settlements			0
‘ we came across many instances of wives from the @entity88 wanting their cases heard in @entity16 because they felt they had a better chance of securing capital and generous maintenance whilst , in the @entity93 , family lawyers told me that maintenance awards were infrequent at best			1
‘ however , it ’s not simply a @entity98 settlement divide			0
there are considerable local and regional variations which demonstrate the impact of discretion on divorcees ’ circumstances			0
’ it effectively means wives face a postcode lottery over whether they will get extra support			2
some parts of the country are considered more ‘ wife - friendly ’ while judges in other areas will urge a ‘ clean break ’ .			0

lawyers say wives in big cities are more likely to be awarded maintenance
