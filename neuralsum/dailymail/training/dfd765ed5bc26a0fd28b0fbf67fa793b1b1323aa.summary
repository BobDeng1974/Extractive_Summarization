' mockery of justice ' : convicted rapist @entity2 can not be deported to @entity3 because it would breach his human rights a @entity3 rapist who held a knife to a pregnant woman ’s throat as he raped her has been allowed to stay in @entity10 to protect his human rights			1
@entity2 , 31 , was jailed for ten years after he threatened to kill his victim and repeatedly assaulted her			1
he was set to be deported on release , but immigration judges have ruled he can not be kicked out because his mother and other family members live in the @entity10			1
they said he had been here so long , it would breach his right to a private and family life to force him to return to @entity3			1
the judges also gave him credit for having ‘ faced up to what he has done ’ and having put his criminal behaviour ‘ behind him ’			2
they also concluded he posed a ‘ low risk ’ of committing further offences , based on evidence from a psychiatrist who only saw him for a couple of hours			0
the case is the latest in a series of human rights judgments in which judges favour the rights of criminals over those of victims and the wider public			2
@entity42 mp @entity41 said : ‘ this vicious man should be on the first plane back to @entity3			1
it makes a mockery of @entity10 justice and human rights to see such a dangerous thug dance rings around the @entity10 system			1
’ @entity2 came to @entity10 aged 11 in february 1993 to join his mother , brother and sister , who arrived three years earlier			1
they were all given indefinite leave to stay in 2000			0
but in 2007 he was sentenced to ten years in prison for the horrific sex attack , in which he repeatedly raped a ‘ vulnerable ’ pregnant woman in her early twenties who had been sleeping at her home , after holding a knife to her throat and threatening to kill her			1
despite the evidence against him he refused to accept his guilt , forcing his victim to go through the ordeal of a trial			2
even while in jail he refused to admit what he had done			0
when the @entity71 began efforts to deport him , he immediately claimed asylum			0
this application was rejected last year , by which time he was out of prison after serving half his sentence			2
but @entity2 ’s lawyers appealed against his deportation on human rights grounds			1
earlier this year , a @entity71 lawyer told a tribunal @entity2 should be deported because of the ‘ very serious and disgusting nature of his offence ’			1
the @entity71 pointed out that even after he was released from prison he continued to show ‘ no respect for the law ’			0
for example , while on probation , he was caught using cannabis but instead of being returned to jail , he was given a £ 60 fine			0
@entity2 said he was ‘ afraid ’ to return to the @entity94 region because of the civil war			1
he claimed that he was n’t a practising @entity96 , despite having ‘ @entity97 ’ tattooed in @entity98 on his arm and chest			0
and because his parents had never taught him about the clan structure in @entity3 , he would also struggle to fit in , he said			1
the tribunal accepted that because he had tattoos , which are considered un-islamic in @entity96 countries , he would be ‘ vulnerable to serious harassment ’ , but concluded it was safe for him to return			0
legal row : @entity2 immediately claimed asylum when the @entity71 , pictured , began efforts to deport him however , they then allowed him to stay because of his right to a private and family life under @entity113 of the @entity114			1
despite not having any children or a wife in @entity10 , they said it would be wrong to send him home because of the length of time he has lived in @entity10			1
the judges also decided he could stay because of his ‘ close relatives ’ here and ‘ very regular contact with his parent and siblings ’			2
first tier tribunal judge @entity128 , sitting in @entity127 , said that even though he did not admit his guilt in prison , he had since owned up and completed a ‘ victim empathy ’ course while on probation			0
she concluded it was ‘ shame and fear that he would be disowned by his family ’ that meant he did not confess at the time , and attributed his lack of candour to the fact that it was his first time in prison and that the offence was ‘ against the sensibilities of his own community ’			0
psychiatrist dr @entity149 said that @entity2 would be ‘ deprived of the emotional support of his mother and immediate family if deported to @entity94 ’			1
after speaking to him for just two hours , she said there was only a low risk that he would commit serious sexual or violent crimes			0
she said he was ‘ depressed as a result of possibility of deportation and from witnessing his brother committing suicide ’			0
sending him to @entity3 would also increase his suicide risk because he would be unlikely to have access to the anti-depressants and therapy he receives on the @entity166			2
she concluded that he was a ‘ well - loved member of his family and his friendship network and that his deportation would have a negative impact on their own lives ’			1
the @entity71 appealed but this was rejected by an @entity174 , which said : ‘ although he has committed serious offences , he has at last faced up to what he has done and has taken significant steps to put behind him that kind of criminal behaviour			0
’ @entity2 , of @entity180 , @entity127 , said : ‘ i ’m not commenting about the case			2
you ’ll have to speak to my solicitor			0
’ his aunt , @entity185 , said he did not want to go back to @entity3 because he had ‘ no family or friends there and it is dangerous ’			1
a @entity71 spokesman said : ‘ we are extremely disappointed with the court ’s decision and plan to appeal			0
‘ those who come to the @entity10 must abide by our laws and if they do not we will seek to remove them			2
in 2012 we removed more than 4,500 foreign national offenders			0
‘ for too long the @entity114 has been abused by foreign criminals to avoid deportation			0
' that ’s why we introduced tough new rules to protect the public that are being included in our @entity205			0

the 31 - year - old was set to be deported to @entity3 on his release
but immigration judges have ruled he can not be kicked out because his mother and other family members live in the @entity10
