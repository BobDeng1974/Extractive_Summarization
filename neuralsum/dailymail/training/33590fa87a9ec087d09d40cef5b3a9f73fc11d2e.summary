holes in the walls , cracks in the plaster and peeling tiles are just three of a long list of problems one homeowner discovered when he moved into his £ 580,000 dream house			0
@entity9 and his wife , @entity10 , 35 , hoped the newly - built property would be the perfect place to start a family			1
but they soon uncovered major faults with their four - bedroom home - and have catalogued 140 since moving in five months ago			1
and mr @entity9 , 45 , is so frustrated with homebuilder @entity17 that he has set up a @entity19 account to list them - and warn others off buying similar homes			1
freezing : @entity9 , 45 , was shocked to discover the loft of his newly - built four - bedroom home , pictured , had not been fitted with insulation poorly finished : the £ 3,000 granite kitchen worktop if the £ 580,000 property , pictured , was not fitted properly , leaving gaps between two pieces sludge : the @entity31 also discovered that no turf had been laid in the garden - just one of 140 faults they uncovered in the property the couple first found signs of wear and tear - including cracks in the walls and plaster - shortly after moving in to the home at @entity44 , @entity45 , last september			1
they also encountered bigger problems , such as a badly - fitted £ 3,000 granite kitchen unit and a misplaced toilet , in the detached home			2
and when temperatures started to plummet last winter , marketing director mr @entity9 discovered his home - which was advertised as being ' energy efficient ' - had not been fitted with loft insulation			1
he has created a @entity19 account to vent his frustration , and publicly document the long list of problems that he claims have yet to be fixed			1
desperate : this photograph , which appears to show poorly - finished floorboards , was captioned with the words ' please fix our house ! ' warning : the toilet is off - centre , left , and , right , the photographs and notice the @entity31 ' posted on their windows to publicise their problems ' gaping holes ' : this photograph shows a corner of the house that appears to be exposed to the outside , it was posted on @entity19 by mr @entity9 using the account @ @entity76 , mr @entity9 shares photographs taken inside his home along with captions explaining what is wrong			1
no loft insulation poorly - fitted kitchen counter no grass in the garden gaping hole in corner of one wall off - centre toilet unfinished floor faulty bathroom mastic peeling plaster and paintwork cracks on toilet floor gaps in bathroom sealant wonky doors ill - fitting toilets not energy efficient he said : ' i should n't have to resort to these sorts of measures to get something done			0
' i 'm really disappointed because we were told we 'd have a new home that would not need any work as we want to start a family			2
we lived in @entity109 for seven years and did a lot of work on it			0
we did n't want to live in a building site again , and that 's what 's happened			0
' the couple have even posted the photos in the windows of their home along with a warning to house - hunters hoping to buy a property in the same new development			2
and the @entity31 are not the only couple to have experienced problems since moving to the 48 - home estate			1
@entity128 and @entity129 said their home has been a constant building site since they moved in last summer			0
the couple have had three separate patios installed in just six months after bodged building work meant rainwater kept flowing into their garage and flooding it			0
mr @entity138 said : ' we have n't found anyone living here who is happy			0
' the site manager told one lady who lives on her own that they are building water - tight properties , not @entity147			0
but we are paying @entity149 prices			0
' mrs @entity129 added : ' we have reached rock bottom with the circumstances that we find ourselves in			0
' @entity153 builder @entity17 insists it is constantly working with residents to repair faults			2
a spokesman said : ' we would like to apologise to mr @entity9 and his wife for the issues they have experienced with their new home			1
we are in regular contact with the customers , and have met with them to discuss their specific concerns			0
' during these meetings we have agreed the work that will be undertaken to resolve the issues and we will complete this as soon as possible			0
' improved : mr @entity9 posted this picture on @entity19 of what the mastic in his house looks like after @entity17 had promised to fix it frustrated : marketing manager @entity9 , left , and one of the photographs of peeling paint he posted using the @ @entity178 account major problems : another photograph taken inside the loft reveals the lack of insulation			1
it is one of 48 homes on the new development fault : this photograph taken in the @entity31 ' poorly - finished bathroom was captioned ' more quality fit and finish from @ @entity193 ' mocking : mr @entity9 posted this picture with the caption ' when trimming doors most builders use straight cuts			1
not @ @entity193 ' unfinished : the 45 - year - old said that this toilet was one of the ' better fitted ones ' in their new home in @entity44 , @entity45			2

@entity9 and @entity205 hoped five - bedroom home near @entity207 , @entity45 , would be perfect place to start family
but the couple soon uncovered major faults and have catalogued 140 since moving in just five months ago
mr @entity9 , 45 , grew so frustrated with homebuiler @entity17 he set up @entity19 account to document problems
