by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 today confirmed its controversial @entity3 @entity5 will fight the upcoming @entity6 by - election for the party - despite recent controversy over a series of remarks about homosexuality			1
mr @entity5 sparked outrage in 2012 after likening gay marriage to incest			1
the 70 - year - old has also claimed people should be able to prefer being straight to being gay - like some people prefer @entity19 to ordinary tea			1
@entity5 has rarely avoided controversy during his career as an mep , but has been returned to @entity23 three times and in 2000 he said being gay is ‘ not worthy of valid equal respect ’			1
mr @entity5 's selection comes after @entity2 leader @entity28 ducked the chance to fight the @entity31 seat			1
the byelection was called after the disgraced former @entity34 mp @entity33 resigned in the wake of a cash - for - questions scandal			1
mr @entity5 was elected to the @entity37 in 1999 as the @entity3 for the @entity38 - and re-elected in 2004 and 2009 - before defecting to @entity2 in march 2012			1
his outspoken views have caused controversy throughout his career and last year even mr @entity28 said he had gone ' too far ' with his attack on gay marriage			2
in 2012 mr @entity5 said : ' if two men have a right to marry , how can we deny the same right to two siblings ? are we to authorise incest ? ' his made the bombshell remarks in a pamphlet entitled ' straight talking on @entity52 '			1
@entity28 decided not to fight the @entity6 by - election - leaving himself open to accusations that he ' bottled ' his big chance the year before he asked : ' why is it ok for a surgeon to perform a sex - change operation , but not ok for a psychiatrist to try to " turn " a consenting homosexual ? ' mr @entity5 has also dismissed homophobia as a ' weasel word '			1
he said : ' the homosexual lobby is not content with decriminalisation			0
it wants to be accepted as a " valid alternative lifestyle "			2
' but it is not a valid lifestyle worthy of equal respect			1
' at the risk of offending the politically correct , i will argue that homosexual behaviour is abnormal and undesirable			0
' he previously questioned the existence of ' homophobia ' , saying some people found gay relationships ' distasteful if not viscerally repugnant '			2
he defended the remarks , saying : ' different people have different tastes			2
you may tell me you do n't like @entity82			0
that may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you do n't like it			0
the @entity2 candidate added : ' i simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences			0
' it is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality , or vice versa			2
most of us prefer one or the other			0
' he later added : ' i said that people may prefer heterosexuality or homosexuality			2
i did not say that people could dislike – much less hate – other people on the grounds of their sexual orientation			0
' the mainstream media are engaged in a feeding frenzy against @entity2 , and are prepared to twist the facts to suit their agenda			0
' mr @entity5 also insists that he has condemned homophobia during his career			1
he said ' prejudice , hostility and violence against homosexuals are wrong and totally unacceptable '			0
but mr @entity5 's controversial views are not restricted to homosexuality			1
he has claimed that women who are date raped must ‘ share part of the responsibility ’			0
mr @entity5 said in ' stranger rape ' the blame was ' squarely on the perpetrator ' but in date rape cases ' the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility , if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend ’s mind '			2
the outspoken @entity3 has also claimed the @entity132 was ‘ systematically paedophilic ’			0
he said : ‘ so far as i know it has no rules or systems designed to support or promote paedophilia			0
' but i think it would be perfectly fair to describe it as systemically paedophile			0
’ despite mr @entity5 's controversial past , he was ' overwhelmingly ' endorsed by the @entity6 constituency association at a hustings meeting on monday before being backed by @entity2 's @entity145 , a party spokesman said			1
mr @entity5 said : ' i am both proud and humbled to have been selected by the constituency association in @entity6 to represent the @entity2 cause in this historic town in what could well prove to be an historic by - election			1
' ' it would be a huge honour to be elected to serve as @entity6 ’s mp and i will be giving my all over the next few weeks to achieve that outcome			2
' mr @entity28 said : ' he is a massively experienced and respected figure on the national political stage and on the local political stage as well			0
' i know that the @entity2 membership will rally to the cause of making @entity152 our first directly elected mp			0
' the @entity6 by - election is scheduled to take place on june 5 , with the @entity162 selecting @entity163 to run and @entity164 represented by @entity165			1
the @entity166 are expected to choose a candidate in the coming days .			0
