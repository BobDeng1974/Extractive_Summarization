@entity0 has revealed that he is sick of the notion that celebrities are controlling society as members of the secret group @entity5 , in an essay that he penned for @entity10 's @entity9 issue			1
less than a year after his wife @entity22 posed nude for the magazine , the 37 - year - old rapper stars on @entity10 's latest cover , donning a grey sweatshirt from his collection for @entity15 and a necklace featuring his daughter @entity20 's nickname , @entity21			1
in the april issue , @entity0 explained his ' world dream ' and noted that if there was an actual @entity5 , ' it would be more like the energy companies ' - not @entity29 stars			1
' i am tired of people pinpointing musicians as the @entity5			0
that 's ridiculous , ' he said			1
' we do n’t run anything ; we ’re celebrities			0
we ’re the face of brands			0
he explained that celebrities do n't even get the freedom to say and do exactly what they want , let alone ' run anything ' : ' we have to compromise what we say in lyrics so we do n’t lose money on a contract			0
' @entity50 is in her 50s and gave everything she had to go up on an award show and get choked by her cape , ' @entity0 added , referencing @entity50 's recent fall at the @entity75 in february			1
he went on to say that the 56 - year - old legend even gets ' judged for who she adopts ' , adding : ' f * * * all of this sensationalism			1
' on the subject of children , the rapper said we should be thankful that we can raise kids , before noting that we should be trying to bring them up in a ' truthful world ' , not one that is ' based on brand and concepts of perception '			1
star style : the 37 - year - old rapper modeled a @entity0 x @entity15 originals shirt and vintage military pants for the photoshoot proud dad : the father also wore a necklace featuring his daughter @entity20 's nickname , @entity21 sunny day : @entity0 put his had down as he posed in a field of wildflowers ' when i look in @entity20 ’s eyes , i ’m happy about every mistake i ’ve ever made , ' the father - of - one said			1
' i ’m happy that i fought to bring some type of reality to this world we choose to stay in right now , driven by brands and corporations			1
' in addition to striving to bring reality to the world , @entity0 said that he is a proponent of people following their dreams , advocating that a ' little self - belief can go a long way '			1
' i think the scariest thing about me is the fact that i just believe , ' he said			0
' i believe awesome is possible and i believe that beauty is important			0
' and while @entity0 said that beauty is ' undermined by our current corporate culture ' , he added that he also sees money as something that is ' equally important ' - even though ' artists have been brainwashed to look at it as a bad thing '			2
mentoring younger artists , such as @entity132 , a $ @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , is of the utmost importance to @entity0 because he said it will help ' make better music in the future '			0
turn around : the musician was also photographed with his back to the camera true artist : @entity0 showed his @entity0 x @entity145 collection ( pictured ) at @entity147 in february fatherly love : @entity0 said that when he looks into his daughter @entity20 's eyes ( pictured ) he is ' happy about every mistake ' he has ever made ' it ’s funny that i worked at the @entity153 in high school , because in my past 15 years it seems like that ’s the place i stood in my creative path - to be the gap , the bridge , ' he said			1
@entity0 also candidly discussed the fashion industry , saying that while he was grateful that his collection for @entity15 - which was shown at @entity147 in february - was ' accepted positively ' , he found an article that asked : '' should @entity0 leave fashion to the professionals ? ' to be posing an ' ignorant ' question			2
' the second i sell my first t - shirt or my first shoe , does n’t that make me a professional ? ' he asked before saying he finds it ' funny to be so famous and noted for one thing , and to have so many people try to box you out of another form of art. ' when it comes to his love of fashion , @entity0 explained he wants to be as close to as a kid as possible , because when children say that they like something , they are n't looking for a ' thumbs up ' or a ' thumbs down ' , they are just sharing their admiration			2
' @entity187 is something that ’s in my heart to do - in my spirit , ' he said			2
' there ’s no world that can stop me from what i love			2
not the rap world , not the fashion world , not the real world			2
