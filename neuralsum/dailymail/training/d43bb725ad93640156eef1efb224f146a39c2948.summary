' the judge said that the hoax call had been made just days after two explosions went off at the finish line of the @entity111 , leaving three dead , and that the tragedy ' must have been at the very forefront of peoples ’ minds '			0
plans : @entity22 and his fiancée had pencilled in a date to get married at the hall , but he never filled in the ' right to marry ' forms to legalise the marriage he added : ' your call to @entity13 must have struck sheer terror in the heart of the person that received the call and fear in the minds of the people who are charged with the responsibility of the safety of people inside the building			1
' you knew that the wedding could n’t take place and you did n’t try to level with your partner			0
