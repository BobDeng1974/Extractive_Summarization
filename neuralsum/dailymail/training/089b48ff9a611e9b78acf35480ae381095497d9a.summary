the forward produced an accomplished finish to get the @entity92 campaign up and running			0
they needed just eight mintues to double that lead , with @entity7 both starting and finishing the move			0
with a piece of improvisation , he found @entity8 with the outside of his boot and then headed home the return pass after finding space in the penalty area			0
firmly in the ascendancy , @entity0 were three to the good just moments later			0
@entity106 sprinted forward and squared to @entity8 , who found the back of the net with two assured touches			0
