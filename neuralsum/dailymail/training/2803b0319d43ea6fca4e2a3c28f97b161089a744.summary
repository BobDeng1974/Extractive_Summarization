by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 19:37 est , 20 january 2014 a coroner demanded action yesterday after a critically ill pensioner died waiting for an ambulance while several crews in the area took ‘ undisturbable ’ rest breaks			1
@entity10 could have survived if his wife ’s first desperate 999 call had been responded to in time , an inquest heard			0
@entity13 , 63 , made four increasingly frantic calls over 50 minutes after her 74 - year - old husband was taken ill with chest pains			1
' unacceptable ' : @entity13 ( left ) frantically called 999 when her husband , @entity17 , 74 , started suffering chest pains			1
crews did not reach their home for 50 minutes on her fourth and final attempt she was forced to accept : ‘ it ’s too late now , he ’s gone			1
’ as she made the calls , six of the region ’s 16 ambulances were on mandatory rest breaks , another eight were queuing outside two hospitals to hand over patients , and the remaining two were dealing with other incidents			0
after delivering a narrative verdict , coroner @entity31 announced he was calling for urgent changes to reduce the risks posed by mandatory rest breaks and delays in dropping off patients at @entity38			1
the inquest heard harrowing recordings of the 999 calls made by the retired gardener ’s wife at their home in @entity45 , near @entity46 , @entity47			1
mrs @entity13 initially phoned at 1.08am on march 21 last year and was reassured an ambulance was on the way			1
tragedy : by the time mrs @entity13 made her fourth emergency call , her husband ( pictured ) had died			1
she told the operator it was ' too late ' half an hour later – and on her third call – her husband stopped breathing and died			0
she dialled 999 for the last time at 1.51am , when she said : ‘ this is the fourth time i ’ve rung for an ambulance , it ’s too late now , he ’s gone			0
’ mr @entity10 was suffering from heart disease and a chronic lung condition and died from heart failure			0
the coroner told the inquest at @entity65 that three ambulances eventually reached the couple ’s home , with the first ‘ arriving 48 minutes after the initial call ’			1
mr @entity31 said : ‘ although it can not be established with certainty that mr @entity10 would have survived if help had reached him sooner , it is probable that if an ambulance had arrived promptly after the first call , that is to say within their target response time of eight minutes , he would have lived long enough to be transported to hospital where further medical treatment would have optimised the prospect of his survival			1
’ the inquest had previously heard how one of the first paramedics on the scene , @entity85 , received a ‘ red two ’ call – the second most serious alert – at around at 1.32am			0
but he ‘ politely declined ’ to help because he had been on shift for six hours without a break			0
prior to the call he had waited 99 minutes to hand over a patient at @entity97 ’s @entity38 department			1
a short time later mr @entity85 and his colleague @entity98 got another call requesting their help on a top priority ‘ red one ’ call , and they agreed to give up the break			0
the strict rest break policy means paramedics must be stood down to take an ‘ undisturbable ’ 30 - minute meal break once they have been working for five hours			0
delays : paramedics had to wait 99 minutes to transfer patients from their ambulance to hospital staff , meaning a limited number of ambulances were available to attend the call ambulance service officials told the inquest that the break must be taken where hot food can be prepared and served , meaning paramedics can not simply park in a layby to eat sandwiches			1
mr @entity31 said the loss of any life to a ‘ potentially avoidable delay ’ was unacceptable			2
he said he was writing to the local ambulance trust and health board to express his concerns that unless action was taken the risk of other deaths would continue			0
the coroner wants to know why the system for prioritising 999 calls does n’t take into account whether someone has been waiting for an ambulance to arrive			2
numbers : there were 15 ambulances on duty in the whole of @entity47 on the night mr @entity10 died he also wants to encourage greater sharing of @entity146 facilities			1
canteens in hospitals appear not to be available to paramedics , meaning crews could be wasting precious time ‘ returning to base ’ for their mandatory breaks			0
professor @entity153 , medical director of the @entity155 , and @entity156 , chief executive of the @entity157 , issued a joint statement , saying : ‘ we are taking a range of actions to ensure that our busy ambulances and emergency departments are available to those who need them most urgently			1
’ @entity13 ( pictured ) begged the emergency services for help for her husband , @entity17 mrs @entity13 : ‘ it ’s my fourth call , i think my husband has just died			1
’ operator asks for her full address mrs @entity13 : ‘ this is the fourth time i ’ve rung for an ambulance , it ’s too late now , he ’s gone			1
’ operator : ‘ are you with him now			0
’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ there ’s not much point now , he ’s dead			2
’ operator : ‘ how old is he ? ’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ he was 74			1
’ operator : ‘ is he awake ? ’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ no ’ operator : ‘ is he breathing ? ’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ no. ’ operator : ‘ alright , what happened ? ’ mrs @entity13 ; ‘ he just could n’t take the pain anymore and could n’t breathe anymore			2
’ operator : ‘ okay , i ’m organising help for you now			0
’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ there ’s nothing i can do now for him , he ’s just lying on the bed			2
’ operator urges mrs @entity13 to help her husband by laying him flat on his back on the floor			1
mrs @entity13 : ‘ i ca n’t do that , there ’s nobody here , he ’s died			2
’ operator : ‘ are there any neighbours that can help you ? ’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ no , there ’s nothing i can do , he ’s dead			2
’ operator : ‘ i can tell you how to help him			0
’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ you ’re too late , i ’m sorry			2
’ operator : ‘ are you wanting to help your husband ? mrs @entity13 : ‘ just let him go			1
he was in pain , i do not want him to suffer			0
it ’s not that i do not want to help him , he ’s gone			0
’ operator : ‘ let ’s help him together			0
’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ i ca n’t he ’s gone			2
do n’t you understand ? i do n’t want to get him back to suffer more			0
’ operator : ‘ when did he stop breathing ? ' mrs @entity13 : ‘ two minutes ago			1
’ operator : ‘ just follow my instructions , you do n’t have to do anything you do n’t want to do			0
’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ i just want someone to come and take him , it ’s nearly an hour … what are your target times ? ’ operator : ‘ what do you mean … we try to get to patients as quickly as possible			2
’ mrs @entity13 : ‘ well , you have n’t succeeded this time			0

@entity13 rang for ambulance when husband , @entity17 , 74 , had chest pains
delays in @entity38 meant patient transfers took 99 minutes
meant no ambulances could go to their home in @entity45 , @entity47
when a crew was found , they refused to attend as they were on a break
coroner @entity31 : ' @entity157 needs to make changes '
15 ambulances were on duty for the whole of @entity47 that night
