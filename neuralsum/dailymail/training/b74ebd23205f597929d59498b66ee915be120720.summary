by @entity0 for most people , having a shower and sponging off is an easy task - but it sends @entity6 's heart racing			2
the mother - of - four suffers from @entity8 , a fear of holes which means even the thought of holding a sponge sends shivers down her spine - and she is forced to flee the shower if she spots any bubbles floating in the plug hole			1
her terror is so real she quit her job in a school kitchen because as soon as she saw a cluster of holes - in crumpets , the bottom of mushrooms or the inside of peppers - she would have a panic attack			1
@entity27 , 45 , from @entity28 , @entity29 suffers from @entity8 - a fear of holes			1
even sponging off in the shower brings her out in a cold sweat even having a cup of tea brings her out in a cold sweat			0
she said : ‘ if i see any bubbles in my tea , i have to stir them out with a spoon or i have to drink with my eyes closed			0
’ @entity27 , who now works as a part time check out assistant , said : ‘ i ’m worried that insects will crawl out of the holes , especially in the sponges			1
it ’s not the holes themselves that frighten me , but rather what ’s inside them			2
@entity27 , 45 , had to quit her job in a kitchen because the holes in food like crumpets and peppers gave her panic attacks ‘ my life was turned upside down			1
i was in tears and started to think i was going to break down every time i saw something that triggered me			2
’ the nightmare first began three years ago , after @entity27 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , watched an advert for @entity64 shower gel on tv			1
she said : ‘ i hated it when the camera would pan out from the naked people on the screen and merge into the pores of someone ’s skin			0
‘ as soon as i saw it , my skin would crawl and after that , as soon as i heard the voice over for the advert i had to turn over to another channel			0
’ her world was turned upside down			0
she said : ‘ there were loads of things i was fine with , and then suddenly i just could n’t bear them			0
‘ when i suffered an episode at work , i felt like i was going to pass out and i ’d be on the verge of tears			0
‘ it would start with a tingle in my head , which made me want to rip my hair out then i would break out in goosebumps all over my body and i ’d want to rip my skin off			0
’ @entity27 suffered in silence , until one day at work in the school kitchens , she had a breakdown			1
the final straw came when her colleague was making a pizza and unaware of her phobia , she showed her the holey base			2
@entity27 said : ‘ she had no idea about my phobia , but was telling me how she did n’t like the patterns herself			1
i started crying and had an anxiety attack , it was horrible			2
my heart was racing and i had to sit in the office to calm down			0
‘ i realised that i could n’t carry on like this so i quit my job a month later			1
’ @entity27 researched her symptoms on the internet and discovered that her bizarre fear was in fact a phobia of holes			1
but doctors do not recognise the phobia , and @entity27 wants sufferers to be taken seriously			1
she said : ‘ not many people understand , so i am very careful who i tell about my phobia			2
i have told some friends and family and they were supportive but it was still embarrassing			0
i just do n’t want people to think i ’m mad			0
’ but her phobia does have one plus point – she does n’t have to do the washing up			2
but @entity27 's phobia does have one ' silver lining ' - she does n't have to do the washing - up because her husband @entity131 , 46 , ( pictured ) does it @entity8 is fear , revulsion or disgust of objects with irregular patterns of holes			1
@entity139 academics @entity140 and @entity141 , who claim to be the first to scientifically investigate trypophobia , believe the reaction to be based on a biological revulsion , rather than a learned cultural fear			2
they found that holes in skin , meat , wood , plants , coral , sponges , mould , dried seed pods , honeycomb , soap , cheese , soil , plants , wounds , bubbles , waffles , speakers caused sufferers distress			2
their study in journal @entity167 also found some people think that something might be living inside holes and are afraid that they might fall in the holes			0
@entity141 and @entity140 concluded that @entity8 triggers a fear of danger			1
the holes , or images of holes , stimulate ' a primitive portion of his or her brain that associates the image with something dangerous			0
' @entity27 , who lives with husband @entity131 , 46 , and children @entity183 , 22 , @entity185 , 20 , @entity186 , 14 , and @entity187 , 12 , said : ‘ it ’s the only silver lining of the phobia			1
’ and now she has started to face her fears and is receiving @entity191 to help her cope with anxiety			1
during the therapy she has to pop bubbles and is forced to use the objects she fears most - sponges and crumpets			1
@entity8 has been investigated by dr @entity141 , a lecturer in vision science at the @entity199			1
dr @entity141 believes everyone has the phobia to a certain degree			0
he said : ‘ @entity8 is the most common phobia you ’ve never heard of			1
we estimate that around 16 percent of the population is trypophobic but we think that everybody has it to a certain degree			0
’ and dr @entity141 has his own theory as to why people are so embarrassed to disclose their fear to their loved ones			0
‘ as the phobia is n’t officially recognised , people think they are the only ones to suffer from it			0
thankfully the internet is raising awareness and we hope that with more publicity we can get the condition recognised			0

@entity27 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , suffers from @entity8 , a fear of holes
her terror is so real she had to quit her job in a kitchen because she was scared of the holes in crumpets and mushrooms
the part - time check - out assistant is receiving treatment to cope with anxiety
@entity27 , 45 , who has four children , says she wants to raise awareness about bizarre phobia
