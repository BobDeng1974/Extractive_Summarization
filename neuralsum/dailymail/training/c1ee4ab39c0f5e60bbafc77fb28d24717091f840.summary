morally repugnant : april @entity11 ( left ) and her husband and father of her four children , @entity32 ( right ) are accused of mistreating a blind , special - needs girl who has been in their care since 2004 the teenager , who suffers from cerebral palsy and is visually impaired , weighted just 67lbs and appeared ' skeletal , ' and she had 23 rotten teeth			1

the rest of the @entity58 ’ home was filled with all the trappings of middle - class prosperity , including two flat screen televisions , laptops , iphones , an @entity64 , and even a large reptile menagerie			0
the couple 's ward was orphaned at age 7 and was left in their care			1
in 2004 , @entity11 became her legal guardian , and the couple spent the next eight years collecting $ 4,100 a month in @entity74 funds intended for the girl			1
instead , officials say the husband and wife pocketed all the money , which was their only source of income since neither one of them had a job			0
the sheriff 's office and the @entity84 were asked to check up on the special - needs patient in the @entity58 ’ care in october 2012 by staffers at @entity88 , who became concerned about her health			2
accused swindlers : officials say the @entity58 relied on the $ 4,100 a month in @entity74 and @entity94 payments intended for their ward 's care because neither of them had a job when detectives and a case worker knocked on the family ’s door , april @entity11 initially tried to prevent them from entering the residence , according to court documents			1

in return , she was paid $ 3,500 a month through a government program and another $ 600 in @entity94 benefits			1
however , the self - proclaimed nurse could not tell officers how the girl in her care was being fed. after the emaciated , severely neglected cerebral palsy patient was taken away from the couple , the wife filed for unemployment and received a total of nearly $ 20,000			1
torture chamber : officers who entered the family 's home in rural @entity12 were ' taken aback ' by the stench in the orphan 's room , which was strewn with trash and soiled clothes following her rescue from the couple 's home , the neglected teen was placed in the care of a court - appointed guardian ; she has since put on more than 30lbs and got 19 root canals to repair her damaged teeth			2
the @entity58 , who have been married for more than 13 years , have three sons and a daughter			0
the family have since moved from @entity12 to @entity152 , @entity153 , where @entity11 took a job at a local gym			0
