@entity0 and @entity1 are likely to be the beneficiaries of the footballing meltdown of @entity5 ’s @entity4 , with @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 ever more likely to leave at the end of the season after the 2012 @entity13 runners - up from slumped to the bottom of the @entity15			1
wednesday night ’s 1 - 0 defeat against @entity17 witnessed the extraordinary scenes of goalkeeper @entity19 climbing the perimeter fence to sympathise with angry fans after the home defeat left them three points from safety			0
@entity7 , too , was pictured talking to fans through the metal grille of the fences and apologised to fans			1
@entity0 's hopes of signing @entity7 will be boosted if @entity4 are relegated @entity29 , @entity0 and @entity1 would be interested in @entity8 if he was made available @entity1 may step up their interest in @entity4 and @entity31 midfielder @entity9 the bottom of the @entity15 as it stands but with @entity33 , @entity31 ’s most powerful newspaper , now asking : ‘ is @entity5 still the right man for @entity4 ? ’ it seems clear that the next few months will mark the end of the era for the team that so charmed @entity39 in 2011 and 2012 with its high - energy incisive football			1
@entity5 himself has to show improvement by the @entity44 derby match at the end of the month or face the sack , according to @entity33 : an extraordinary fate for a man touted as @entity50 ’s successor just a few months ago			1
@entity5 ’s team though also looks ready to be broken up as the strongest personalities , who made up its backbone in the run up to the @entity13 final , seem ready to leave			2
@entity8 ’ departure in the summer is set and it was significant that the player received the worst possible mark from @entity33 of 6 , indicating ‘ awful ’ for wednesday night 's display , with the comment that he was more of ‘ liability than leader , more of a risk than a creative force ’ and that he appeared to be ‘ longing for @entity67			0
’ @entity4 defender @entity69 talks to supporters after defeat by @entity17 on wednesday night one fan voices his frustration at @entity75 after @entity4 slumped to their 11th league defeat of the season @entity4 goalkeeper @entity19 also tried to placate angry supporters after final whistle february 7 @entity82 ( a ) 13 @entity83 ( @entity84 ) 20 @entity85 ( a ) 24 @entity86 ( a ) @entity13 last 16 , first leg 28 @entity44 ( @entity84 ) @entity88 3 @entity89 ( a ) @entity91 round of 16 7 @entity92 ( a ) 14 @entity93 ( @entity84 ) 18 @entity86 ( @entity84 ) @entity13 last 16 , second leg @entity8 , who sustained an ankle ligament injury on the eve of the @entity98 finals last year , has his heart set on a move to @entity101 , but their transfer ban means that he will no longer be able to move there in the summer			2
@entity29 are likely to step into the breach as the club most likely to sign him			0
@entity108 have been the traditional destination of @entity4 players , @entity111 and @entity112 having taken that route in the past two seasons , but relations between the club are now so bad after @entity108 's chief executive @entity116 publicly revealed that @entity8 has a £ 20million buy - out clause , that a deal there would be impossible			1
@entity120 and @entity0 ’s only chance will be if @entity29 decide not to pursue him			2
@entity1 and @entity123 would also bid – but @entity1 ’s surplus of midfielders means they may not be willing to pay the kind of wages he will be offered elsewhere			2
hummels of course has been @entity135 ’s no 1 choice of defender ever since he took the @entity0 job last summer and though the club was unable to buy him from @entity4 last summer , the fall - out from this calamitous season and @entity7 ’ own comments that he would consider his future at the end of the season mean that he is likely to end up at @entity142 – though @entity4 will demand £ 30million			1
@entity4 coach @entity5 was bewildered by his side 's 11th defeat in 19 @entity15 games @entity4 's dejected players , trailed by coach @entity5 , trudge off the field at the end of the match @entity7 is high up on @entity0 manager @entity135 's transfer wish - list @entity9 is a player who was highly - rated and desired across @entity39 two seasons ago – but who has since spent the best part of last season out with a back injury , which meant he missed out on last year ’s @entity98 triumph			1
@entity1 had him high up their list of targets prior to that injury and will sign a defensive midfielder in his role over the summer			2
the @entity163 , whose contract runs until 2016 , has a buy - out clause of £ 16m			2
@entity1 are likely to look at other options first but if he can demonstrate some of the old form , he could yet end up at the @entity170			0
for now though all three star players and @entity5 have a relegation battle with which they need to contend			0
prior to the five - week winter break , almost all pundits were convinced that , bad though things were , there was no chance of @entity4 being relegated			1
after two games back , no goals and no wins , that certainty no longer holds			0
@entity33 ripped into @entity4 following their latest loss and suggested that @entity5 has until the @entity183 with @entity44 on february 28 to show there is ' light at the end of the relegation tunnel ' otherwise his job is under threat			1
they add that the greatest example of how standards have fallen this season is star man @entity8 , who ' displays a body language more like @entity194 than @entity195			0
' they say his heart is already set on a @entity4 exit , most likely to @entity67			0
@entity33 add that @entity198 was a bad buy and does n't fit into @entity5 's system at all			1
@entity201 are scathing in their ratings , with @entity9 , @entity203 , @entity8 and @entity198 receiving a score of 5			0
in the @entity163 ratings system , 1 is regarded as ' excellent ' and 6 as ' awful '			0
new signing @entity206 and defender @entity208 both receive 4.5 , while the highest marks of 3.5 are given to @entity19 , @entity210 and @entity211 .			0

@entity4 are currently bottom of the @entity15 table
@entity5 is likely to lose his side 's top stars if @entity4 are relegated
@entity0 are keen on signing @entity4 centre back @entity7
£ *16million* - rated @entity9 is *attracting* interest from @entity1
