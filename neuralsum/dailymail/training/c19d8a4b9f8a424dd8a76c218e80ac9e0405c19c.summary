by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 11:49 est , 20 march 2012 a @entity1 that made world headlines after being infamously written off by an @entity4 agent has sold for more than $ 370,000 ( £ 230,000 )			1
the once - pristine @entity5 was stolen from a dealer in @entity7 , @entity8 , in 2003 and only discovered five years later			1
but the owner 's relief turned to rage when one of the federal officers looking after the vehicle took it for a spin and smashed it into a hedge before its return			1
oops ! the @entity5 was crashed into a hedge by an @entity4 agent in 2008 while he was looking after the vehicle during a probe into its theft five years earlier written off : the crash tore a huge hole in the left - hand side of the supercar			1
the damage came to a eye - watering $ 750,000 its chequered history did n't deter buyers , however , as a bidding frenzy erupted on @entity36 salvage website @entity37			0
the auction site was managing the sale for an insurance company following a complicated legal dispute with the @entity42			0
it eventually sold for $ 370,000 ( £ 233,000 ) after costs - with the buyer now expected to spend a further fortune painstakingly restoring it to its former glory			1
the 1995 model 's complicated history began in 2003 when pilot and criminal @entity51 entered a @entity54 @entity1 showroom requesting a test - drive			1
ouch ! the car shows severe damage to the front axle as its towed away from the scene on the mend : the new owner who bought the car for $ 370,00 is now expected to spend another vast sum to get it fully restored the 1995 model of the @entity5 is one of just 349 ever built and was the fastest car to ever come out of the @entity70 company 's factory when it was launched			1
with a 4.7 - litre v12 engine developing 513bhp , it could accelerate from 0 - 60mph in 3.7 seconds - when in full working order ( like this one above )			0
it could reach a top speed of 202mph			0
during the test , the salesman got out of the @entity1 - giving @entity51 the opportunity to accelerate away in the @entity70 car			0
it was thought the @entity1 , being one of just 50 in the @entity36 , would be shipped off to another country and into the hands of a wealthy motorist 's collection			0
so the insurance company paid out on the vehicle - only for @entity51 to have stored it in an aircraft hangar alongside two other stolen @entity92 in @entity93			2
he sold the supercar in 2008 to a @entity93 doctor for $ 375,000 ( £ 250,000 ) plus another @entity1 convertible			2
when the unsuspecting buyer went to register his ownership with @entity1 in @entity70 , he was shocked to find it was the now legendary stolen @entity5			1
he called the cops and the @entity4 arrived the next day to take car away			2
however , while transporting the @entity1 from one warehouse to another , agent @entity102 lost control and crashed it in @entity106 , @entity93			0
the insurance company , which had paid out £ 400,000 when it was stolen , demanded the @entity42 pay ( $ 750,000 ) £ 475,000 for the vehicle			0
but they refused , claiming the accident occurred ' while the @entity1 was being detained by the @entity4 ' and said the bureau was granted immunity due to a controversial federal law			2
@entity51 pleaded guilty to grand theft auto and was jailed for two years .			0

*iconic* @entity5 supercar was stolen from a dealer in @entity8 in 2003
@entity4 found it five years later , but *bungling* officer crashed into it hedge
new owner will spend another fortune restoring model to former glory
