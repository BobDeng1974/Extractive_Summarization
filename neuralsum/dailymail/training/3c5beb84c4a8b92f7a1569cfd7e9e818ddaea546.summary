it may be the most devastating act of mercy in history			2
a newspaper report chronicling how a boy of four was saved from drowning has surfaced in a @entity8 archive			1
the child – who historians believe could have been @entity11 – was plucked from the icy waters of the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity8 , in january 1894			1
rescued : @entity15 , left , saved the life of a four - year - old @entity11 , pictured right in an undated photo , when they were both children according to @entity20 , a priest who went on to become one of @entity23 's most famous organists , his predecessor @entity15 had rescued the terrified @entity11			2
father @entity20 told before his death in 1980 how @entity26 , around the same age as @entity11 , had seen the other boy struggling in the waters of the @entity13 and dived in to rescue him			1
the story was never verified by @entity11 during his lifetime			0
but now a small cutting from the @entity34 - @entity33 newspaper - of 1894 has been found in @entity14			1
it describes how a ' young fellow ' fell through the thin ice of the river in january of that year			0
the report described how a ' determined comrade ' - the paper at the time was left - wing - went into the freezing water to save the child who would grow into mankind 's biggest monster			0
icy waters : a young @entity11 fell in the @entity13 in @entity14 , southern @entity8 , across the border from his native austria the near - drowning episode also featured in a @entity8 book called ' out of @entity52 , ' by @entity53 , a personal history of her family 's connections with it			1
she wrote ; ' the banks of the @entity13 provided an idyllic setting for the children to play			0
monster : @entity11 never admitted to the near - drowning accident in later life ' in 1894 , while playing tag with a group of other children , the way many children do in @entity14 to this day , @entity11 fell into the river			1
' the current was very strong and the water ice cold , flowing as it did straight from the mountains			0
' luckily for young @entity11 , the son of the owner of the house where he lived was able to pull him out in time and so saved his life			0
' @entity11 would , as a young man and later among his generals , tell stories of how he played cowboys and @entity83 on the banks of the river but he never once related the near - drowning tale			0
' in @entity14 , however , ' said mrs @entity53 , ' everyone knew the story			0
some of the other stories told about him were that he never learned to swim and needed glasses			0
' no name is given for the child in the old @entity14 newspaper but historians believe it gives credence to @entity97 claim that it was indeed @entity11			1
later this month @entity99 is to run a news feature programme on the incident			2
called ' if @entity11 had drowned			0
the legend of a fatal lifesaving ' will feature several elderly @entity14 residents confirming that they heard the story of @entity11 's near - brush with death as they grew up in the city			1
holocaust : child survivors in @entity112 just after the camp was liberated by the @entity113 it is likely that @entity11 airbrushed the incident out of his life history			2
being rescued by a boy who went on to represent a religion he despised would not have sat well with the myth he had built around himself of being called by destiny to save @entity8 .			1
