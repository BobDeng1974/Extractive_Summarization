' it is worrying that this auction house is set to make a tidy sum of money from the sale of items that are hugely offensive to a lot of people			1
' it raises again the question about freedom of speech - you ca n't force people to stop selling @entity2 memorabilia and making money from it but you can deplore it			2

' the @entity42 auction reminds me of a set of artefacts that was presented to the @entity201 twenty - five years ago shortly after it was established by the @entity202			1
' they were a compelling illustration of how @entity205 was once such a part of everyday life			0
the challenge for the museum , according to the director , was how to present this in a public exhibition			0
' they wanted to be sure that it would demonstrate the evils of anti-semitism and not inadvertently contribute to it			0

pictured : the gates of the notorious concentration camp @entity66 @entity2 survivor @entity91 , 88 , pictured left today and right in 1946 , whose parents , @entity93 and @entity94 , and grandmother , @entity95 , were killed at @entity7 , said the auction was ' hugely offensive ' and ' deplorable ' mr @entity91 and his sister @entity225 were sent to @entity66 when they were just two years old			1

he said : ' our consignments come from all over the planet - everywhere from dusty attics to unwanted museum holdings			0

why ? well , think of another six year period of history that affected the world as greatly as did @entity137 this anti-semitic book , that features caricatures of @entity11 , is expected to fetch $ 400 anti-semitic images inside one of the books up for auction at the sale in @entity42 , @entity4 ' in this day and age when so little history is taught in schools , the war remains relevant , important and vitally interesting to almost everyone			1
' many believe that the buyers of this type of material are neo-nazis , revisionists , or people who idolise the @entity20			0
that could not be further from the truth			0
' they want ' proof ' , a connection , a relic - something to prove that these people existed , and that these events happened , good or bad			0
' i am committed to making this material available as i believe that ' not all history is good history ' and destroying or neglecting these items will only make it easier for revisionists decades or centuries from now to pretend that the @entity2 never happened			2
' dedicated collectors and institutions must have access to this ' criminal evidence ' which would otherwise be sold privately and never offered to them			0
