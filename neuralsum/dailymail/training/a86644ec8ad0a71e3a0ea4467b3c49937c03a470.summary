by @entity1 reporter a dangerous trend has seen more than a dozen women in @entity4 die from botched plastic surgeries involving injecting synthetic silicone into their buttocks			1
at least 40,000 women in the @entity10 nation have undergone a procedure where they have a gel - like substance called a synthetic biopolymer shot into the butt cheeks			1
as opposed to a silicone implant , the synthetic substance flows like an injection and spreads uncontrollably through tissue , leading to deformities and sometimes death			1
eager to resurrect her failed marriage , @entity34 dreamed of having a shapely rear end			2
a risky , potentially deadly , silicone injection technique beckoned			1
now she rues that day			2
‘ it hurts so much i can not sit down for even five minutes , ’ said the 45 - year - old , her voice quivering			2
she is so embarrassed she wo n’t give her last name			2
two years ago @entity34 received 560cc of the stuff in each buttock			2
it was a low point in her life when she was desperate to rekindle her marriage and win back her estranged husband			2
‘ i did no research on what it was			2
i just wanted to know who did the best job , ’ @entity34 says while waiting at a clinic			2
her dream is to get the silicone out of her body			1
playing with fire : dr @entity24 consults three female patients who have all undergone the dangerous amateur injections taking action : @entity63 , right , tries on a body corset before undergoing surgery to remove liquid silicone removed at a clinic in @entity68 getting ready : @entity63 stands in front of a friend as she prepares to undergo surgery devastating results : women with cosmetically enhanced behinds stand in the waiting room , some in too much pain to sit down saviour : dr @entity24 explains to patient @entity78 how the removal of the synthetic biopolymer from her body , a procedure which costs up to ten times what she would have paid for the original injection damaged goods : @entity86 shows the deformation caused by an illegal lip injection the original operation cost the equivalent of $ 800 ( £ 498 )			1
days later , she started feeling an intense pain			0
she has learned to live with it , as she has with stinging criticism from her family			0
‘ i ask @entity98 and the @entity99 for forgiveness so i can get out of this			0
this is no way to live , ’ she said , her eyes clenched shut			0
@entity103 , who underwent the same procedure only to see the gel migrate to her lower back and hips , created a support foundation in 2011			1
it is called the ‘ no to @entity114 ’ and has recorded 15 deaths so far from complications resulting from this beauty enhancing technique			1
the foundation has knowledge of 40,000 people who opted for the procedure , and the number is growing even though in november of 2012 the @entity4 government banned the use of use of stuffing - like materials such as the synthetic biopolymers for aesthetic purposes			1
the authorities have brought charges against some doctors and beauticians who continue to offer the service			0
‘ there are even recent cases of parents who give their daughters the biopolymer butt and breast treatment for their 15th birthday and now they regret it , ’ said @entity131			1
@entity139 , a 35 - year - old trainer at a gym in the western city of @entity142 , shot the gel into his pecs to look more buff and is now an utter wreck			0
finally : dr @entity24 plans the incisions on patient @entity148 , 30 , before she has the industrial silicone removed from her body fingers crossed : dr @entity24 looks at the x-rays of @entity148 before the procedure , which is done at great risk as there may not be any improvement at all horrifying end : dr @entity24 holds up a ball of liquid silicone removed from a patient who had paid to have it injected into her buttocks to increase its size surgeons remove damaged tissue and silicone from @entity148 's butt which had travelled around her body after the illegal injection the polymers migrated to muscles between his ribs , tightening his thorax and limiting his breathing			1
he ’s been flat out in bed for two years			0
‘ i can not do exercise			0
i am a living dead man , ’ said @entity139			0
with his artificially toned up muscles , he said , people shun him in hospitals and treat him as if he were @entity180 - positive			0
he went to one of two doctors known to be offering a technique to try to rid people of the stuff they pumped into themselves			0
one is a @entity68 plastic surgeon named @entity24			0
in the waiting room of his office it is standing room only			0
he says that since 2011 he must have seen about 400 patients with this problem			1
the legion of walking wounded in his clinic includes : a 60 - year - old woman who can barely move she is in so much pain ; two cousins who had the procedure done at the same time and while not yet smarting , are scared by what they are hearing ; and a woman who is trying to get pregnant and is worrying what the silicone in her body might do to a fetus			1
the best they can do : @entity63 is being cleaned up after surgery , although the swelling will go down , there is no guaranteeing a success on the other side : @entity148 recovers a day after her surgery , eagerly awaiting the results doctors put a body corset on patient @entity63 after she has had the results of a botched butt implant reversed the final result : @entity148 , shows off her giant scar during her recovery from the surgery @entity24 withdraws the silicone in a $ 6,000 ( £ 3,730 ) operation that is still considered experimental by the @entity223 , as there is no guarantee of complete recovery or even improvement			1
@entity228 , president of the society , said the only time it endorses the procedure is when the gel is actually at the point of bursting out of the body			1
‘ it is a special situation that can cause septicaemia and with it , death , ’ he said			0
a better approach is to treat the problem with steroids , which gives pretty good results , he added			0
but @entity24 said he has already operated on 50 women and three or four men			1
still , some of the gel will always remain in the body , he said			1
‘ it is an incurable disease			0
’ as for @entity34 , she got her husband back but can no longer have sex and even refuses to take her clothes off in front of him because her rear is so bruised			0
and she can no longer even have sex .			0

at least 15 women have died in @entity4 from bad butt implants since 2011
the dangerous surgeries involve having synthetic biopolymer injections
as the silicone is not in implant form , the substance travels in the body
at least 40,000 women in the country have undergone ' butt jobs '
the procedures have been banned but the women find a way around it
