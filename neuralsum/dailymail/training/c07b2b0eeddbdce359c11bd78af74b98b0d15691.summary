a tech wizard who set up a website to help people exploit a booking loophole to get cheap flights has raised $ 30,000 in donations for his legal battle with @entity7			1
the carrier is suing @entity9 , 22 , for showing thousands of fliers how to employ the ' hidden city ' ticketing technique to make substantial savings on their fares			1
his website , @entity15 , lets fliers get cheap fares by telling airlines that their final destination is only a stop - over			2
@entity9 , 22 , from @entity21 founded @entity15 last year which used the technique described as ' hidden city ' ticketing this way , some fliers can book a cheap , multi-leg ticket instead of a more expensive direct one - and simply leave the airport part during the stop			1
but lawyers for @entity7 and travel site @entity31 have said the strategy creates ' unfair competition ' and demanded $ 75,000 from the coder - prompting a flood of online donations from supporters			1
a crowdfunding page on the @entity41 website has so far attracted $ 27,000 to pay for the legal battle , with donations from 1,360 people			1
on the page , @entity9 wrote that he is certain his strategy is legal , and that he has attracted @entity7 's wrath because they are doing ' too good of a job ' saving people money			1
he said : ' @entity51 's sole purpose has always been to help you become savvy travelers			0
the site has a method which means customers could get lower fares by booking your final destination as a stop - over ' we have been doing that by exposing pricing inefficiencies for air travel , among other things			2
' unfortunately , we have been doing too good of a job so @entity7 and @entity31 recently teamed up with a lawsuit to get in the way			1
' everything @entity51 has done and continues to do is legal , but the only way to effectively prove this is with lawyers			0
please show your support for @entity51 by donating towards this campaign to help fund our legal team			2
' on the page , well - wishers wrote of their support alongside the donations			0
one , @entity80 , wrote : ' the airlines have no right to complain , it 's a system they created			0
' another , @entity86 , said : ' this is absurd , with a little investigation online any search engine you can do this yourself			0
this small company just makes it easier			0
' the ' hidden city ' technique has existed for years , though @entity9 's tool allows consumers to take advantage of it with less work on their part			1
the website promises reductions of as much as 45 per cent on some routes			0
@entity7 and @entity105 claim the strategy creates ' unfair competition ' , and are asking for $ 75,000 in damages ( file picture ) however , the practice is not effective on all routes , and airlines have been known to retaliate by billing customers the difference if they discover the ploy , or removing points from frequent flier accounts			1
it often only works for one - way journeys , as some carriers cancel the remaining parts of a booking journey as soon as a passenger misses one step			0
passengers also ca n't combine the strategy with taking bags in the hold , as they wo n't be able to get them back during the stopover			0
@entity9 , who was born in @entity130 but grew up in @entity131 , @entity21 , told @entity132 that he was expecting the lawsuit			2
he insists there is nothing illegal about his website and says he is just exposing an ' inefficiency ' in the pricing system			0
he told the site : ' [ hidden city ticketing ] has been around for a while , it just has n't been very accessible to consumers			1
' @entity9 is currently working at a tech start - up and says @entity51 is simply a ' side project '			2
@entity146 , president of @entity147 , an airline consulting firm in @entity149 , @entity150 , told the station travellers will still use similar techniques even if the site is shut down			0
@entity154 , president of @entity155 , said he worked for @entity156 as a ticket agent 30 years ago and was trained to look out for ' hidden city ' ticket sales .			2

@entity9 , 22 , from @entity21 founded @entity15 last year
the website uses ' hidden city ' technique ticketing to save money
attracted wrath of @entity7 and @entity31 travel , who sued for $ 75,000
more than 1,300 people have made online donations to fund legal battle
@entity9 is *convinced* his method is legal and will fight the large companies
