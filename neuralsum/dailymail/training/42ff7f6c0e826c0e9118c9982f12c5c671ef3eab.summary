@entity1 boss @entity0 defended his decision not to include @entity3 in his starting line - up against @entity5 , as the @entity6 's fell to a second successive @entity8 defeat on saturday			1
the 67 - year - old , who had an extraordinary bust - up with the @entity11 earlier in the season , brought @entity3 in from the cold to start him in last saturday 's defeat at @entity14 – with the 25 - year - old putting in an assured display			1
despite that , @entity0 opted not to use him from the off against @entity20 's side this time around , believing it to be too big a risk to change a system that has worked so effectively for @entity24 at @entity25 this term			1
@entity3 was left out of @entity1 's starting line - up against @entity5 , despite impressing at @entity14 @entity0 has defended the decision to bench the playmaker from @entity31 taarabt battles for the ball with @entity5 and @entity35 winger @entity34 on whether he felt he made a mistake not starting @entity3 , @entity0 replied : ' i did n't think it was right to change a system which has worked so well for us at home this season			2
' our home form has been great and its been because we 've played a certain way , and @entity46 and @entity47 have been pivotal to that			0
' he ( @entity3 ) did some bits and pieces and showed some good skill when he came on though			0
i just said to him downstairs get yourself fit as you 're an amazing talent and could be vital for us this season			0
' @entity55 brings the ball forward for @entity1 past @entity57 ( left ) and @entity58 ( centre ) @entity60 ( right ) flicks the ball past @entity1 midfielder @entity61 ( left ) @entity62 ( centre ) celebrates scoring his side 's opening goal at @entity25 second - half goals from substitutes @entity62 and @entity68 ensured @entity24 remain in the bottom three , as @entity70 's side got back to winning ways after last sunday 's defeat against @entity73			2
@entity0 , though , insisted he was pleased with his side 's display in the 2 - 0 loss - their first home league defeat since october			2
he added : ' i felt it was one of our better performances at home this season – we were a threat to them for sure			0
' i felt the system was working well again but when you 're up against a side like @entity5 , they 're always going to cause you problems as they 've got world class players and we were outdone by exactly that			0
' @entity68 seals three points for @entity5 with his cool finish past @entity96 @entity1 sit 19th in the @entity8 table with as many points and have lost 10 consecutive away games			1
