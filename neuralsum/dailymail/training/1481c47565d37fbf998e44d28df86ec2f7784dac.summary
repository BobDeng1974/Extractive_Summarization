by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 11:14 est , 23 september 2013 @entity2 scientists will launch a ‘ janitor ’ satellite with flexible tentacles that could sweep up space junk within five years			1
@entity7 will be sent to remove thousands of bits of jettisoned rocket and satellite components orbiting our planet at speeds of more than 28,000 km / h. the satellite will get hold of orbiting debris and throw it back into @entity18 's atmosphere , where they will burn up on re-entry			1
last year , a @entity29 report said that the amount of space junk orbiting earth had reached a ' tipping point '			1
in practical terms , this means that the amount of junk floating around the planet will make it difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet			1
' we 've lost control of the environment , ' said retired @entity29 senior scientist @entity44 , who authored the report			0
last year , @entity45 ( @entity45 ) announced its intention to design and launch @entity7			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites since the first object , @entity58 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris			2
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			0
it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity18 's orbit , traveling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph			1
the picture above shows a ball of twisted metal , thought to be fallen space junk , on a farm in @entity83 , @entity84 , in 2008			2
the group have now come a step closer to their goal by entering into a partnership with @entity89 ( @entity90 )			0
@entity90 is developing a new method to launch satellites weighing up to 250 kg , and will take charge of @entity7 's launch , now scheduled for 2018			2
the company said it will invest £ 10million in the project and will launch the satellite into orbit			2

@entity7 's mission is to grab hold of a piece of space junk - in this case an out - of - commission @entity2 nanosatellite measuring 10cm on each side - and thrust it into the atmosphere , where it will burn up			1
getting to and seizing the ex - satellite is a formidable feat of engineering			0
a three - phase launch @entity89 - @entity90 is now the prime partner in this project			0
the company , headquartered in @entity125 , @entity2 , is developing a new launch method for small satellites up to hundreds of kilograms in weight			0
it plans to send a small shuttle rides on top of an @entity133 jetliner			1
video : @entity7 , a @entity2 solution to space junk @entity7 's mission is to grab hold of a piece of space junk - in this case an out - of - commission @entity2 nanosatellite measuring 10cm on each side - and thrust it into the atmosphere , where it will burn up when the plane reaches cruising altitude , this @entity146 ( @entity147 ) will start its engines and take off upwards			1
when it reaches an altitude of 80km , it will eject a vessel , which after reaching an altitude of 700 km , will releases the satellite into @entity18 ’s orbit			2
according to the company , the three - phase process will cut launch costs by a factor of four			2
and to make sure that this does n’t end up putting even more space debris in @entity18 orbit , @entity90 will ensure that all the elements in the chain include their own re-entry systems			1
the company plans to launch @entity7 in 2018 and said the satellite design is on the right track			0
the design is slighter larger than originally planned , and will weigh about 30 kg. ‘ you ca n’t democratise space access without having a responsible attitude , ’ said @entity171 , chief executive of @entity89			0
‘ if we do n’t deal with the problem of orbiting space debris and its accumulation , future generations ’ access to space will be compromised			0
it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity18 's orbit , traveling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph			1

satellite will throw debris into @entity18 's atmosphere to burn up on re-entry
it will launch in 2018 using a three - stage process involving a @entity133 jetliner
there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity18 's orbit
