by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 06:08 est , 14 february 2013 despite crucial tips that led authorities to find @entity4 , it has been revealed that nobody will be able to claim the $ 1.2million reward in the case of the killer ex-cop			1
the rogue former police officer is believed dead after he was cornered in a burning cabin in the @entity11 on tuesday after a furious gunbattle with law enforcement officers			0
likely beneficiaries of the reward would have been @entity16 and @entity17 , who surprised @entity4 , who had been staying in an upstairs room in their condo near @entity21			2
when pressed about the reward by reporters , mrs @entity17 said : ' no one is getting that because he needed to be captured and convicted			0
' the @entity17 , who were tied up and had their heads wrapped in pillowcases , were able to break free after @entity52 had stolen their car and fled the home			0
the call set @entity4 's final hours in motion when the car was spotted by game wardens , who pursued it until @entity4 crashed - and he fled to another cabin , which is now ravaged by fire			0
the couple came forward to clear up earlier reports that it was their housekeepers who had surprised @entity4 and were tied up in the home			1
lucky to be alive : @entity69 was carjacked by @entity4 and says the revenge - bent former cop pointed an assault rifle at his head , but allowed him to flee with his life - and his dog @entity75 killer : @entity4 , pictured in a january surveillance tape , reportedly shot two deputies on tuesday as tried to escape out of the back door of the cabin , killing one of them but @entity4 encountered one more person before his last stand - a driver whose pick - up truck @entity4 stole moments before the gunfight with officers			1
the motorist , 61 - year - old @entity69 , told the @entity90 , that it is he who deserves the reward after he had called authorities to notify them about @entity4 's latest movements			1
he told the paper : ' someone owes me $ 1 million			0
it was my call that led the officers to him			0
' but he did say he was willing to share the reward with anyone else who may have helped authorities catch up with @entity4			2
' i know there were two other women involved and i do nâ€™t mind parting it three ways			0
' police departments , local governments , business leaders and police unions pool their money to offer a $ 1million reward two days before @entity4 's capture			1
hiding under their noses : @entity4 was discovered in a condo half a mile from a temporary command center according to @entity120 , the reward was upped to $ 1.2million after donations by @entity122 , the @entity123 and various business leaders and law enforcement groups			1
but as @entity129 reported , a technicality in the wording of the reward offer would mean that no one is eligible to receive it			1
@entity133 sources told the site that the legislative analyst and the city attorney were at odds earlier in the day about how the reward offer should be interpreted			0
in the days leading up to the final showdown , @entity4 gained national attention for his he was on the run and an bizarre online manifesto in which he detailed his plot to kill specific police officers			2
his writings also included various shoutouts to celebrities , including @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			0
@entity152 officials appealed to the public for help catching him after he killed three people , and several rewards were established to find @entity4			1
the reward was announced by @entity152 mayor @entity158 on sunday as the initial leads regarding @entity4 came up empty			2

cops and @entity164 officials had raised up to $ 1.2million for any info leading to the arrest and conviction of @entity4
maids who were tied up by @entity4 earlier on tuesday are top *candidates* for the reward
@entity69 , the driver who was carjacked by @entity4 moments before the *fatal* *firefight* , also wants a piece of the reward
because @entity4 was killed , a technicality in the wording of the reward could mean that no one would be eligible
