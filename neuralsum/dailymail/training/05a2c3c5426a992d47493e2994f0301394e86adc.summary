by @entity0 launch : @entity2 is among the @entity4 nations with plans to develop its own rocket four other @entity4 countries in receipt of hundreds of millions of pounds in @entity11 aid have their own space programmes , the @entity7 can reveal			1
the row over aid spending intensified yesterday when it emerged @entity11 is pumping more than a billion pounds into oil - rich @entity15 which has plans to put a man in space			1
but taxpayers are also funding aid programmes in @entity4 , @entity22 , @entity2 and @entity23 – all of which have their own space agencies			1
many are in their early stages , but include ambitious and expensive plans for satellites and even rockets			0
over the five years of this government , the four nations will receive more than £ 1.5billion from @entity11 taxpayers			1
@entity23 will be handed the most , a total of £ 596million , followed by @entity2 which is getting £ 480million			1
@entity22 will receive £ 460million			1
@entity4 will be given £ 112million – almost as much as it spends on its space programme			1
the long - standing project is estimated to cost some £ 110million a year			0
in may ministers announced direct aid to @entity4 would end in 2015			2
international development secretary @entity40 said it was now the region ’s ‘ economic powerhouse ’ and was ‘ in a position to fund its own development ’			0
but until then it will still be handed some £ 19million a year			0
the @entity46 was founded in 2009 – the same year that the first @entity4 government - owned satellite was launched on a @entity50 rocket			0
it cost an estimated £ 1.7million and collects images for agriculture , water management and urban planning			0
@entity23 ’s space agency was set up last year and the country ’s politicians have made clear their intentions to get a satellite into space			0
@entity2 also has a space research programme , paid for in part by its government , and plans for a satellite and rocket			2
ludicrous : despite millions of @entity69 living in extreme poverty , governments are spending huge sums on space programmes @entity22 ’s @entity73 is thought to be several years away from putting a satellite into space			2
the revelations will intensify pressure on ministers over @entity11 ’s spiralling aid spending			1
the @entity81 ’s budget will rise by 35 per cent in real terms by 2015 , at the same time as spending on areas of critical national importance such as the police , military and immigration is being slashed			0
@entity11 is also handing about £ 280million a year in aid to @entity90 , another country with its own space programme			1
changes : international development secretary @entity40 told @entity4 it will no longer receive direct aid by 2015 the row was sparked by comments from @entity97 mep @entity96 who said it was folly to give billions in aid to ‘ @entity101 ’			2
he was widely criticised for using the term ‘ @entity101 ’ but many commentators believe he was right about the building resentment over foreign aid			2
he said : ‘ how we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month , when we ’re in this sort of debt , to @entity101 is completely beyond me			0
’ and he claimed foreign leaders frittered aid money away on ‘ @entity114 sunglasses , apartments in @entity116 and @entity117 ’			0
on thursday @entity118 said the remarks were offensive and accused mr @entity96 of being guilty of a ‘ stop the world i want to get off ’ approach to foreign aid			2
but the revelations that oil - rich @entity15 , which is receiving £ 300million in @entity11 aid this year alone , had ambitious plans to launch its own rockets sparked fury			1
critics asked why @entity11 was , in effect , subsidising a space programme for a nation where 70 per cent of people live below the poverty line			0
backbench @entity135 mp @entity134 said it was ‘ totally unjustifiable and unaffordable ’ for @entity11 to give this money to @entity15 , given the scale of its ‘ grandiose ’ space programme			0
but the @entity81 has defended its aid spending , saying the money goes to poverty reduction , health and education programmes , and would benefit @entity11 by cutting immigration and crime .			1

@entity4 , @entity22 , @entity2 and @entity23 all have space agencies
countries will receive £ 1.5billion in aid from @entity11 from *current* government
revelations will intensify pressure over our foreign aid spending
