education secretary @entity0 last night stepped into a bitter race row raging over an inner - city school ’s plan to open its own boarding school in an affluent rural area			1
the top - performing @entity6 in @entity7 , near @entity8 , @entity9 , wants to transport 600 youngsters to a site with stunning views over the @entity13 every monday morning for lessons and bring them back on friday evenings , free of charge			1
it says the scheme will provide them with ‘ an @entity20 - style experience ’ and help keep pupils safe from drugs and knife crime			2
row : a disused school in the town of @entity26 , @entity27 , is earmarked to be filled with boarders from @entity9 's @entity6 , causing fury among residents who fear an influx of ethnic pupils will cause social problems @entity34 of his eye : the academy , in @entity7 , is one of the best in @entity9 and is a favourite of education secretary @entity0 but the plan has been fiercely criticised by people living near the site – a disused boarding school in the quiet village of @entity26 , @entity27			1
they have raised concerns about the number of black and @entity49 students and claimed that youngsters would need to be searched daily for drugs and weapons			1
they have also accused @entity55 ’s ‘ super-head ’ @entity56 – who has been described as a ‘ hero ’ by mr @entity0 – of ‘ spoiling a tranquil place ’ by ‘ bringing @entity8 to the countryside ’			1
but last night mr @entity0 's spokesman hit back and attacked those ‘ trying to obstruct an inspirational project ’			1
his intervention came after a local @entity66 county councillor expressed fears about the number of ethnic minority students who would attend the school			1
@entity71 , 73 , told @entity72 : ‘ ninety - seven per cent of pupils will be black or @entity49			2
it depends what type of @entity49			0
if they ’re @entity79 they ’ll rise to the top			2
if they ’re @entity83 they ’ll rise to the top			2
if they ’re @entity86 they wo n’t			0
‘ there are certain nationalities where hard work is highly valued			0
there are certain nationalities where they are uncertain what this hard work is all about			0
‘ if the children are not allowed out of the site then it will make them want to escape into the forest – it will be a sexual volcano			1
‘ has anyone asked whether these children want to be plucked from their natural surroundings ? they have never done boarding before , so they wo n’t know how it works			2
shock : @entity6 chief @entity56 has described the attitude of residents as ' shocking ' but has vowed to press on with the scheme ‘ the trauma of taking the children out of their natural surroundings is going to be considerable			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity7 is a coloured area – i have no problem with that			1
to be honest , i would far rather @entity55 took over a secondary school in @entity9 rather than shoving everybody here			2
’ @entity117 , chairman of a steering group which has been set up in the area to fight the plans , also questioned whether inner - city children would feel comfortable in such a rural environment			2
she said : ‘ it might raise tensions in their community			0
their peers might say , “ why have you been chosen to go to a special , smart school in @entity27 but i have n’t ? ” ‘ the whole thing is a massive experiment and i think it will be disastrous			1
there ’s no evidence it will increase their attainment levels			0
when you ’re a teenager , is n’t it too late to start appreciating the countryside ? i do n’t know if it ’s the right environment			0
’ at a public meeting in the nearby village of @entity141 , where actor @entity142 has a home , one unnamed resident said : ‘ you must be wary because you are talking about students who will have to be searched daily for weapons and knives			1
’ @entity148 mp @entity147 is also ‘ extremely unhappy ’ with the way the project has been handled and has written to mr @entity0 asking him to rethink the idea			1
mr @entity56 , @entity152 ’s director of education , last night described some of the comments from residents as ‘ shocking ’ but vowed to press on with the scheme			2
it is hoped the boarding school will open next year			1
he said : i ’ve heard a few comments made about pupils escaping and i said i ’m not building a prison			0
‘ it ’s sad but it makes us want to fight harder for it , and when this councillor sees the hard work and commitment from ethnic minorities i ’m sure he will change his tune			0
‘ at the moment , so many children are leaving our school well educated only to be utterly failed by the secondary system			0
‘ we want to get pupils away from hanging around the streets of @entity8 and @entity7 , where we have stabbings and a constant threat of trouble			2
it will be very hard to maintain a negative view when you see students working hard and contributing			0
you will soon realise these are frankly nothing more than baseless prejudices			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity152 has a superb record of helping some of our most disadvantaged pupils achieve brilliant results thanks to a rigorous curriculum , great teaching and sky - high expectations for all pupils			1
‘ @entity152 ’s boarding school is a bold experiment and a chance to give inner - city youngsters a truly world - class education			1
’ and leading black conservative mp @entity203 urged locals to drop their opposition to the plan			0
mr @entity203 , whose parents came to @entity208 from @entity209 and who was educated at @entity20 , said : ‘ this school is a very good idea			0
‘ obviously , the locals will have some concerns about it , but we have to give these children the chance to get a good education and a well - run boarding school in the @entity222 countryside is a perfect way to do that			1
opposition : local @entity66 councillor @entity71 is aghast at @entity152 's plans to move to @entity27 ‘ if the school is a success , as i am sure it will be , it will be a great credit to the pupils , teachers and the local community itself			1
when that happens everyone will wonder what all the fuss was about			0
’ @entity55 is a primary school that has been rated as outstanding by schools watchdog @entity239			0
but staff and governors are so concerned about standards at local secondary schools that they used the proceeds from @entity152 ’s leisure and student accommodation business to buy @entity248 , a @entity249 listed building , for £ 3.4 million in 2010			0
they want to open it as a boarding school for pupils aged 13 to 19			1
mr @entity56 has said the idea stemmed from a desire to keep youngsters away from the ‘ stabbings and constant threat of trouble ’ in @entity9			0
it secured a £ 17 million handout from the government to help finance the project			0
as an academy , @entity55 is outside local authority control , meaning it runs its own budgets and can even change the length of terms and the school day			2
@entity248 ’s , which occupies 20 acres in an area of outstanding natural beauty , used to be run by the local county council for children with special needs but closed in 2004 and has remained empty since			0
at his keynote speech at the @entity66 conference in 2011 , mr @entity0 backed the idea of opening the boarding school			1
he also praised mr @entity56 as a ‘ hero ’ after for transforming @entity152 .			0
