brothers of the @entity2 fraternity at the center of a now discredited @entity5 article about gang rape have spoken out for the first time to detail how they were forced into hiding after the story incited mass protests on campus			1
the article about the issue of sexual assault at @entity2 starts with the horrifying account of one student who claims to have been gang - raped by seven men in an apparent initiation ritual at the @entity21 fraternity two years ago			1
but after several holes in the victim 's story were brought to light , and a police investigation found no evidence the crime ever happened , the @entity21 fraternity was taken off suspension this week and are set to start their new remember recruitment - known as @entity30 - tonight			1
@entity32 president @entity31 , a 21 - year - old junior from @entity33 , @entity34 , spoke with the @entity35 and described the night in november when he and his brothers huddled around and read the damning article			2
breaking their silence : @entity21 president @entity31 , left , and fraternity brother @entity40 , right , spoke out this week to detail how their fraternity responded to the allegations in the now - discredited @entity5 article which named the house as the location of a gang rape in fall 2012 afraid : the brothers say they were forced to check into hotel rooms when their house on the @entity53 campus became the center of mass protests ' some people actually had to leave the room while they were reading it because they were so upset , ' @entity31 said			1
details of the story were so distressing and cruel that it sparked mass protests on campus , with many calling for the end of all @entity66 life			0
all fraternities and sororities were suspended for the rest of the semester while the university and local police investigated			0
just hours after the story came out , the @entity74 house was gratified with statements like ' @entity77 ' and ' @entity78 ! ' and the brothers say bricks were thrown through the windows			1
anonymous : the @entity2 junior who accused the fraternity of gang rape , identified as @entity85 , has had her story discredited in several reports fearing their safety , most of them fled the house , booking hotel rooms			1
rumors of the @entity5 article started in september , when an executive from the nationals office was dispatched to the campus to question them about a story line the reporter chasing surrounding an incident at the fraternity in the fall of 2012			1
' he basically asked if , one , we knew about [ the allegations ] and , two , if we had committed it , ' said @entity31			0
' the look around the table was complete shock and awe			0
' reporter @entity111 sent @entity31 an email with three questions before publishing the article , but would not say when the alleged gang rape happened or reveal any other details that would help him give her a detailed answer			1
the reaction after reading the article when it was finally published , was shock and then confusion			0
details of the article did n't add up to the brothers who were members of the fraternity when the alleged incident happened			1
' we knew that the @entity5 story was not true , ' said @entity40 , 22 , a senior from @entity129 , @entity34			2
the brothers checked old emails , bank accounts and other fraternity records and discovered that they did not hold a party at the house the weekend of september 28 , 2012 - and that no one in their fraternity matched the description of the primary attacker , a junior who worked at the university pool			2
they also staunchly denied the suggestion that the incident was an initiation ritual for new members , as details of the attack suggested			2
' we vehemently deny that it would be plausible as a ritualistic tradition to join our fraternity , ' @entity31 said			0
vilified : above , some of the gratified that tagged the house after the rolling @entity155 article was published in november ' it 's animalistic and totally unrealistic , ' @entity40 added			2
the brothers decided not to announce these revelations immediately , holding off until december to issue a statement that marked the quick unraveling of the victim 's claims			2
while they insist they are not the real ' victims ' of the story , the brothers do n't believe it was right that they were all automatically condemned as rapists with the publishing of the story			0
' that leads back to the bigger problem in that our society tends to rush to judge without the facts , ' @entity31 said			0
' they just see the headline and get upset , and they want to blame it on someone , and obviously we were the easiest targets for that			0
' since the article was published , @entity74 members have undergone sexual assault seminars and were the first fraternity to sign a new university policy about parties at @entity66 life parties			1
the new rules were developed to protect revelers from being slipped date rape drugs in their drinks			0
all fraternities must sign the pact by january 16 , and two are holding out so far - saying they are being blamed for the campus ' bad press .			0
