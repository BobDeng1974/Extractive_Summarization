experts say exercising can worsen the symptoms of nut allergies because it causes the gut to become ' leaky '			1
this allows the allergens to be passed into the blood faster , and blood to be pumped around the body more quickly			0
now her father , @entity56 , 58 , has spoken about his daughter 's death			2
' @entity6 's normal nut allergy control just did n't work because she 'd been exercising , ' said mr @entity61 , who lives in @entity62 , @entity63			1
' fitness was something she 'd taken up more recently			0
' @entity6 had always taken tablets for allergies , whereas in reality , she should have had an @entity69 and been educated on the risks of exercise			1
' what i 'd like to see is everybody with allergies be fully equipped and fully educated			1
' mr @entity61 , who lived with his daughter in @entity62 , @entity63 , said he will never be able to forget watching her collapse and die			0
exercise - induced anaphylaxis is where physical exercise sparks a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction			1
it can also worsen the symptoms of allergies			2
during anaphylaxis , the body ’s immune system over-reacts to an allergen , triggering the release of the chemical histamine , which can affect the airways and mucous membranes ( lips and eyes ) and cardiovascular system			0
dr @entity96 , a consultant in adult allergy at @entity99 ’s and @entity98 in @entity63 said this allergic shock can be made worse by exercise			1
he said : ‘ the exercise involved can be moderate - one patient suffered anaphylaxis when pushing her baby ’s pram up a hill - and in many different forms , from labouring on a building site or dancing in a nightclub to taking a walk or going for a run			1
' but it ’s thought that the more the person exerts themselves , the stronger the reaction			0
dr @entity96 added : ‘ one patient , a triathlete , reacted to something she had eaten the night before a race			0
’ why exercise should spark anaphylaxis is unknown , but there are theories that it increases the permeability of the gut , changes the way the blood vessels react to allergens or has an effect on the body ’s neuroendocrine cells ( specialised nerve cells that produce hormones such as adrenaline )			2
@entity134 , alcohol , anxiety and mental stress are also thought to exacerbate the problem			0
he said : ' she was grabbing for her pills for the nut reaction and then it became clear it was a shed load more serious , ' he said			1
' i 'm not sure anyone can possibly understand what it 's like to watch that take place			0
' he called 999 and paramedics arrived but she died in hospital hours later			1
' it was horrible , ' he said			0
' the health service did a great job but it was all too late			0
' now i want to warn people about exercise and allergies			1
' he said miss @entity6 had suffered from a nut allergy since she was a young girl , although no one realised the severity of it			1
she took over-the - counter @entity32 tablets to control it , but was not prescribed an @entity170 as she had no history of severe allergic reactions			1
mr @entity61 said his daughter was a bright , fun and generous girl			0
he said : ' she was fun - loving and the centre of party attention , but also blossoming out for her own career			2
' if she walked into a room full of strangers , she could handle that			0
' she was also very bright			0
she liked having fun but there was also a serious , generous side to her			0
' if she wanted something , she worked for it			0
' her family have set up a @entity187 page , and since miss @entity6 's death , donations have flooded in			1
so far more than £ 45,000 has been pledged to @entity190 , from both those who knew and loved @entity61 , and strangers who have been touched by her story			0
her father said : ' some people who we do n't know have been immensely generous , just because they 've got a son or daughter who has come close to the same fate as @entity6			1
' we want to help protect other people from this			2
' her funeral took place on february 4 in @entity62 , and colleagues from her job at recruitment company @entity208 organised a minute 's applause in tribute to her			0
when she was 16 , miss @entity6 became an organ donor , so after her death she went on to save the lives of three others – including two kidney failure patients who 've been on dialysis for five years			2
while her family have not been told the names of the people who have received her organs , they have been informed that all three are currently in good health			2
' that gives you a great indication of what @entity6 was like , ' mr @entity61 said			2

' she had a boyfriend , @entity242 , and they were planning to go to @entity244 together			0
' life was turning into quite an exciting place for her			0
she had a magnificent mix of focus , fun and heart			0
' a spokesperson for the @entity190 said : ' when someone goes into anaphylactic shock , we recommend they lay down , put their feet up , and do n't walk around or do any type of movement , because this pumps the blood around the body , so @entity6 exercising could 've played a part			1
