the shopping trolley bag so beloved of grannies may be a familiar sight in the post office queue , but it has never been the chic shopper ’s choice — until now			1
this winter , two of fashion ’s biggest names have launched luxury designer versions of the humble wheelie bag			1
of course , you ’d have to win the lottery before you found yourself trundling @entity13 ’s £ 14,100 version or @entity15 ’s £ 6,025 edition around @entity16			2
but the rediscovery of the shopping trolley goes beyond @entity20 ’s poshest labels , and this season they are the accessory of choice for stylish shoppers everywhere			1
indeed , one brand , @entity26 , has seen sales leap by almost 40 per cent in the past two months alone			1
it also has a smooth folding mechanism both in the centre ( to halve it in size for packing away ) and on the wheel configuration , which you can switch from four wheels to two for a speedier ride round supermarket corners by pushing the stand down			0
as a result , it ’s easy to manoeuvre			2
the bag itself is strong and light , in thick waterproof fabric , with an internal pocket for bits and bobs			2
trolley bags are measured in litres and this one will hold 48 — that ’s nearly 85 pints of milk			1
the top pulls closed with a duffel bag - style toggle , beneath a flap with a press - stud that protects the top from rain			2
the only disadvantage is that the wheeled height is non-adjustable , so if you ’re planning on wearing heels to do your shopping , you may find yourself having to stoop to grab the handle			2
style rating : 4/5 @entity81 @entity83 shopping trolley , £ 24 , sabichi.co.uk this pretty two - wheeler brings a touch of chintzy charm to your shopping with its delicate pattern and polka dots — and at £ 24 it is also one of the cheapest on the market			1
while the fabric feels light , it is well put together and has a thermal lining , making it perfect for transporting frozen food			0
at 40 litres ( that ’s a potential 80 tubs of @entity101 ) , it is still pretty big but the fastening is a little flimsy : just a small square of @entity104 holds the trolley ’s flap down			1
the wheels have good rubbery tyres , although it wo n’t take long for their white sheen to look grubby			0
the wheels , like the bag , are supplied unconnected to the frame , but after a couple of false starts we found them easy to put on ( make sure they are clicked properly into place ) — although you may not fancy banging the bag up and down kerbs			1
style rating : 3/5 dotty for dots @entity124 , £ 34.99 , lakeland.co.uk this is a tardis of a trolley			2
in spite of its apparently small size , it has a 40 - litre capacity			2
its clever design means you can either remove or drop the handle to carry it as a relatively normal - looking tote bag			0
the top and the front and back pockets all zip up , so it feels secure , and there ’s a side pocket for a brolly			0
it does n’t feel as sturdy as some of the larger trolleys , though — and that pink bow looks cheap			0
style rating : 2/5 cheap and cheerful @entity149 shopping trolley , £ 22 , ikea.com there ’s no denying that this trolley is a budget option			1
yes , the pattern is cheerful			0
but the 42 - litre bag feels a little flimsy and , over the drawstring fastener , the flap is held down with little plastic twist - locks that feel as if they might snap off if used too vigorously			0
yet for £ 22 it ’s not bad value and features a convenient adjustable handle that works like those on suitcase trolleys , so it will suit both dainty women and their taller sisters			0
its two rubber wheels have decent treads so it should have grip on a muddy day , and although it rattles somewhat cheaply when moved around , it would be great for occasional use			0
the removable interior pocket is a nice touch to avoid scrabbling around for small items such as keys or purses , and there ’s an extra flat zip pocket on the back of the bag which would be handy for a newspaper or magazine			1
style rating : 3/5 @entity185 @entity187 market trolley , £ 63.50 , selfridges.com this trolley from chic @entity190 homewares brand @entity187 is all about understated style			1
it feels contemporary thanks to the nicely finished details such as slender handles , double stitching on the bag , a soft foam grip , two very smooth - rolling wheels and a minimalist aesthetic			0
the laminated waxed canvas makes the bag seem waterproof and hardy , and it looks smaller than its 40 - litre capacity — there ’s plenty of room to stuff it with mineral water bottles			1
it has an internal pocket for small items and a side pocket for an umbrella — though it would probably be better with a zip over it to keep the rain out			0
then again , that would ruin those pared - back , utilitarian - chic lines			0
the main drawback ? in colour and fabric , it ’s ever so slightly @entity222			0
style rating : 3/5 steady cruiser @entity225 shopping trolley , £ 54 , debenhams.com this two - wheeled trolley from @entity225 feels solid and well - made , and is easy to fold away			1
the 40 - litre bag is sturdy , too			1
even better , it has an inner insulated bag with a drawstring top that allows you to separate cold or hot products and keeps them at the right temperature , making it a great choice for the big supermarket shop			1
the main bag also pulls tight with a drawstring , but the @entity104 fastening is less than secure and strangely positioned — one side of the @entity104 runs horizontally and one vertically , so it holds only lightly in the centre			2
the bag feels agile , though , looks a little more eye - catching and cheerful than most trolleys , and there ’s no rattle at all on the wheels — you certainly wo n’t get the wild careering of the average supermarket trolley			1
style rating : 4/5 retro hit @entity254 willow basket trolley , £ 76.10 , englishwillowbaskets.co.uk this will certainly create a stir at the farmers ’ market : it ’s made in @entity259 from willow grown in the county ’s wetlands using methods this family company has employed since 1819			2
@entity265 is incredibly long - lasting if looked after and this is a sturdy item — and although its lack of cover reduces its practicality on rainy days , it is perfect for holding a bunch of flowers without crushing them			0
it ’s a lovely , tactile object and , as it ’s not too tall , there ’s no scrabbling around for lost items			0
best of all is its strong walking - stick handle and stand			0
