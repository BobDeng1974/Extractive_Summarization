@entity1 travel to @entity2 on wednesday , but mention of the @entity5 third - round tie was completely overlooked in saturday ’s matchday programme			1
the club blame a printing error but the slip - up is symptomatic of the @entity1 ’s recent approach to cup competitions			1
last season they made public their preference to remain in the @entity15 rather than attempt to win a cup			2
pressure is mounting on @entity18 but the home fans were mostly supportive of their team last week the @entity1 boss has been critiised after a poor run of form stretching back into last season they have not gone past the fourth round of the @entity26 or @entity5 in seven years			1
this has upset fans who last saw @entity1 lift a trophy in 1969 in the shape of the @entity31 — precursor to the @entity33			2
@entity34 , editor of @entity36 fanzine , told @entity37 : ‘ to hear last year that the cups were n’t a priority was demoralising			0
‘ that was the start of the unrest which led to the walkout at the end of the season			0
if you ca n’t look forward to the cup games then it ’s a sad day			0
@entity48 celebrates the goal that helped put @entity1 out of last year 's @entity26 and start the unrest @entity50 has been struck down by illness and will miss the game against @entity2 ‘ it would be great to hear them come out and say we ’re really going for it , but at the moment there ’s nothing			1
fans will be unhappy if we do n’t get through or play a weakened team			1
’ @entity18 ’s position as manager is safe despite @entity64 sitting bottom of the table after five games			0
supporters , who had been expected to protest , instead got behind the team as they fought back for a point against @entity71 on saturday			0
@entity72 will not face @entity2 in the @entity73 due to illness but victory against @entity2 is crucial , given the fallout from the @entity26 third - round defeat by @entity78 in january when @entity18 fielded a weakened side			1
illness , however , has already robbed @entity18 of @entity50 , who scored twice against @entity71 , goalkeeper @entity72 and forward @entity81			2
@entity82 ( thigh ) and @entity84 ( hamstring ) are also missing			0
@entity81 has also been hit by the illness and will not face @entity2			0

@entity1 have *n't* reached fifth round of *domestic* cup in seven years
pressure on @entity18 to take competitions seriously this year
@entity18 put out a weakened team against @entity78 in last season 's @entity26 when defeat began the unrest among fans
@entity50 among several players who will miss the game
