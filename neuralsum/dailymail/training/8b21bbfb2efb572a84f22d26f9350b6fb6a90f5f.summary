by @entity0 for @entity1 dubbed ' @entity3 ' , @entity2 has been saving orphaned kangaroo joeys in @entity5 for the past nine years			1
while working as a tour guide in the @entity7 , he realised that people in remote areas of @entity5 were looking for a place to take orphaned or injured animals , so he opened @entity12			1
it was later redeveloped and expanded into the larger @entity14 just outside of @entity15			1
' i was a tour guide at the time and i saw the roo on the road and i got off the bus to check it			2
it was bloated and rotting , it 'd been dead for a few days but there was still a joey barely alive in there , ' @entity19 told @entity1			2
' i called her @entity27 after the tv show survivor , it was one of the tribes on there , i nursed her back to health and released her a year later			0
' the baby kangaroos are kept together to bond and form a mob so they can be released together it was from that first rescue that @entity19 began devoting his life to saving baby kangaroos			2
' that motivated me to set up an education centre , because so many people drive past carcases not knowing that there could be a little joey inside that 's still alive , ' he said			0
he quickly discovered that @entity12 needed to be expanded , but he did n't have the funds , ' i had big dreams but no money ! ' ' i had a few kangaroos that had too many injuries to be released and the @entity7 does n't allow kangaroos as pets so they [ the @entity7 government ] were pushing me to find a place for them or to have them shot '			0
@entity2 was working two jobs in order to fund the sanctuary in @entity15 in the @entity7 , when a ' supportive uncle ' left him an inheritance to build it			1
@entity19 will often have a little joey tucked under his shirt in a little pouch to keep it warm from there @entity19 's @entity14 has gone from strength to strength			1
his efforts were even documented for a @entity83 tv show called ' @entity3 ' a spin off of @entity86 's ' @entity85 '			1
@entity3 ' was a two - part series about his story and life as a surrogate mother to so many baby joeys			1
a finalist in the @entity95 awards this year , says he 's always had a passion for animals and became a zookeeper at the age of 17			1
' anyone can do it , ' he said , ' all it takes is learning how and being committed			0
' his dedication goes above and beyond , as he often camps out with the roos in his sanctuary			0
brolga makes sure the joeys grow up among other kangaroos and are released back into the wild once they are healthy @entity19 started the @entity14 from scratch working two jobs to support his passion for saving baby kangaroos @entity19 's 36 hectare area of bushland homes 30 kangaroos of various ages			1
he tries to keep the bushland untouched so that the roos all feel like they are in a natural habitat before being released			0
for the young joeys he creates a faux pouch out of canvas bags and blankets or pillow cases			0
' the babies need to be kept warm so they go everywhere i go ' he said			0
since opening in 2005 , @entity19 's @entity14 has saved over 200 kangaroos it 's a full - time job , these baby kangaroos need 24 hour care @entity19 , a true @entity20 hero hopes to build @entity136 â€™s first wildlife hospital on the grounds of his sanctuary			1
' it would be good to have a place where my mates who also care for orphaned joeys could get medical assistance for the babies without having to go to a vet where out of pocket costs fall on them ' said mr @entity2			2
' it 's a long - term goal but one that i am slowly working towards and it would really benefit us here			0
' to donate or to find out more about @entity19 's sanctuary visit @entity154			2
the joeys go where he goes			0
