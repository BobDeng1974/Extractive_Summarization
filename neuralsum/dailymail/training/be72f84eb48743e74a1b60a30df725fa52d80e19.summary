by @entity0 @entity2 - based @entity1 , 26 , joined @entity3 as a dog because , as a journalist , he was mildly interested to see how other users would interact with him as a non-human			1
@entity3 , the hugely successful dating app whereby users are matched simply by swiping through profile photos of people nearby and skipping or approving potential suitors , is known for its unique approach ; convenient at best and shallow at worst			2
joining initially as a male golden retriever called @entity16 and receiving a series of vapid and predictable ' matches ' who were clearly very bored , the game changed when mr @entity1 switched his gender to female			1
boy meets girl : journalist @entity1 joined dating app @entity3 to see how well he would do posing as a 26 - year - old - in dog years - golden retriever called @entity16 ( pictured ) mr @entity1 , who wrote about the experiment for @entity26 , ' approved ' every profile he swiped past throughout the test , and received 206 matches in the space of a week as a male dog			1
then , re-entering the cluttered digital dating pool as a female dog , he was surprised to be bombarded with 300 male matches in a mere two hours - at 9.30am on a dreary weekday morning no less			1
and while the @entity38 recently conducted a study which revealed that men are 40 per cent more likely to email a woman than the other way around , no one expected this statistic to hold strong cross-species			0
in character : it started off harmlessly enough when mr @entity1 was pretending to be a male dog , female @entity3 users like @entity49 ( pictured ) with arguably a little too much time on their hands willingly playing along canine loving : golden retrievers are undeniably handsome dogs , certainly so for ' swimmer , traveler and engineer ' @entity58 ( pictured ) ' there were too many matches to keep up , ' writes mr @entity1 , who tells @entity61 he has tried online dating as himself a few times , but not ' seriously '			1
' it became difficult to swipe right at a steady pace , because the “ it ’s a match ! ” screen animation would play after every profile and slow me down			0
' bizarrely , a large number of the chats he received as female dog were ' immediately ' sexual he notes			2
things take a turn : when mr @entity1 switched from being a male to a female dog , his profile was suddenly flooded with eager , and often aggressive , male @entity3 users like @entity82 ( pictured ) frequent deeply un-original references to ' doggy style ' flooded in			1
one man , a 31 - year - old @entity86 worker ( according to his profile ) took the time to construct a series of well - worded advances			0
' i 'd donate a kidney and two from my annoying coworker just to take you on a long hike around @entity95 , ' he writes			0
' i 'll bring the tennis ball			0
deal ? ' several were aggressive or downright rude			0
@entity82 , 23 , for example , whose captivating profile summary was : ' hi how you @entity99 let me know let me think [ sic ] ' , opened his line of communication with the simple phrase , ' shut up b * * ch. ' steady on : worryingly , many of the men were entirely unperturbed by the fact they were addressing a dog - so long as she was female , she was a sufficient target for lewd remarks scary : for hero the female dog , mr @entity1 writes ' there were too many matches to keep up ' , from fine gentleman such as @entity118 ( pictured ) who appears to have something of an anger problem another somewhat concerning character , whose profile puzzlingly reads : ' i wo n't freak out if you do n't reply back immediately ' , messaged the canine with : ' yeah that 's right ya mutt bring me the remote ' and ' stop your f * * kin barking or the shock collar is coming on [ sic ]			1
' and 25 - year - old @entity133 , whose only biographical snippet of information is that he stands at 6 ft 1 tall , offered : ' @entity136 , if only i were n't all alone and you were a real woman ... we 're so compatible ! ' before continuing with , ' maybe you can try ? to be real ? for me ? ' these responses were in sharp contrast to the messages he received as a male dog , which were far more light - hearted			0
dashing : this @entity86 trader might even be an appealing candidate , but for the fact that he is willingly engaging in a well - worded exchange with a fictional female dog and then there 's plain desperate : @entity151 ( pictured ) was locked in menial conversation with hero the dog for over an hour , according to mr @entity1 , who quickly got fed up and deleted the app @entity49 , 22 , joined in the game and engaged in a series of ' woof woof ' and ' * wags tail * ' type exchanges			2
@entity58 , also 22 , flirted using cat emojis , and another spent over an hour chatting inanely and submitting gems such as : ' 1 bark means yes and 2 barks mean no ? ' mildly amused by playing a male , and quickly fed up of experiencing a taste of the dog - eat - dog world of being a female on @entity3 - fictional or otherwise - mr @entity1 deleted the app , which claims to match over five million people worldwide every day			1
' it does seem like female users have to experience an unfair amount of objectification and casual misogyny ' ' i got sick of my phone being overloaded with @entity3 notifications and awful messages			2
even if you ’re a dog , online dating is terrible , ' he concludes			0
when we asked mr @entity1 what he deduced from his ill - fated experiment , he said : ' i 'm hesitant to derive too much meaning from pretending to be a golden retriever on a dating site , though it does seem like female users have to experience an unfair amount of objectification and casual misogyny simply by logging in			2
' it 's not necessarily the fault of dating sites , but perhaps a reflection of some ugly aspects of our culture that i hope we can improve upon			0

@entity1 , 26 , was surprised by how his ' matches ' changed when he switched from being a male to a female dog
as a ' female dog ' , he was flooded with lewd and aggressive advances
@entity3 matches over five million people per day
