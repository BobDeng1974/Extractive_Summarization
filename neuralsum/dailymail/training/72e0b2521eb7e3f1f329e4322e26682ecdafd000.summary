by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the smell of braai tinged the streets surrounding @entity5 last night and @entity6 tasted blood as they demolished @entity9 38 - 16 in the opening @entity10 in @entity11 on saturday			1
wales were served up on a plate and their dismal record against @entity16 sides continued with a woeful performance on the @entity18 since @entity19 took over as head coach in 2007 , @entity9 have beaten the big three – @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity6 – just once			1
the misery continued in @entity11 and @entity6 remains a country where @entity27 rugby goes to rack and ruin			2
too strong : @entity6 's @entity29 shrugs off @entity30 to go over for @entity6 falling short : @entity31 is denied a try at the last minute after a great tackle from @entity34 running riot : @entity6 's @entity36 holds off a tackle from @entity9 ' @entity38 there were at least three minutes of @entity27 optimism , but that was all			1
@entity42 put @entity9 ahead with an early drop - goal and it all went downhill from there			2
@entity6 quickly worked out the @entity27 frailties and they began to remind the tourists why they have never won a test match in the @entity48			2
the rush defence was unlocked and @entity50 , the gifted @entity6 , offered a master - class from full - back			1
seven minutes into the game he chipped over the pressing defensive line and @entity56 showed his poaching instincts to get in behind @entity58 and touch down for the opening try of the game			0
@entity6 ’s midfield had been identified as an area of weakness before the match			0
the experience gap between the two centre partnerships was stark			0
@entity67 and @entity68 , of @entity9 , had 98 @entity10 starts at 12 and 13 while @entity69 and @entity70 , their opponents , had zero			0
too little too late : @entity58 ( centre ) scored a brilliant late consolation try for @entity9 mercurial : @entity50 ( centre ) scored a try and played a part in three of @entity6 's other tries but @entity67 was shown a yellow card when he took out @entity81 in mid-air and the hosts took full advantage in the 10 minutes that followed			1
three minutes into @entity67 ’ cool down period and the @entity5 crowd were back on their feet			0
the @entity6 pack were inspired by the return of @entity90 , 37 , who came out of retirement to become the oldest ever @entity93 captain			0
the warhorse was reunited in the second row with partner - in - crime @entity96 for the first time since 2011 and they rolled back the years as the @entity6 pack rumbled forwards from a line - out to set up no 8 @entity102 to crash over			0
another drop goal from @entity42 offered some light relief but , with still just 21 minutes on the clock , the @entity6 scored their third try when @entity81 goose - stepped between @entity58 and @entity107 to feed @entity56 for his second			1
. on target : @entity42 kicks a drop goal past team - mate @entity111 as @entity6 's @entity112 attempts to charge down damage was done but , with @entity67 back on the field , @entity19 would have hoped to see more cohesion across the park			0
they failed to capitalise on their rare opportunities and @entity81 once again exposed the cracks when he gathered his own kick and wriggled through the tackle of @entity30 to score			0
@entity42 added a penalty just before the break but - with @entity9 trailing 28 - 9 at half time - the sun set on the @entity18 and the match turned even darker for @entity19 ’s side			1
@entity129 added to his first - half points with an early second - half penalty and @entity81 got on the outside shoulder of @entity133 to set up @entity29 for another @entity6 try			1
there was a late breakaway try from @entity58 but it was too late , @entity9 had already been cooked .			2

@entity139 , @entity50 and @entity140 also go over as @entity6 run riot in first test in @entity11
@entity6 led 28 - 9 at the break after *blistering* first - half performance
@entity58 scores consolation try for @entity9
