by @entity0 a couple who finally conceived after nine years of trying lost their baby because of a fatal human error by hospital staff , an inquest heard			0
@entity7 , 37 , and her husband @entity9 , 30 , were overjoyed when she became pregnant naturally with @entity10 after four courses of unsuccessful fertility treatment			1
but their daughter died at just seven days old last july because she had been starved of oxygen at birth			1
tragic : @entity17 died at just a week old after being starved of oxygen at birth			1
an inquest heard she would have survived had she been delivered 18 minutes earlier an inquest heard a bungling doctor at @entity23 missed vital signs the baby was in distress and failed to order a caesarean section in time – a decision which could have saved her life			1
as a result the otherwise healthy infant suffered multiple organ failure			2
coroner @entity34 ruled at the inquest last week that @entity10 would have survived if the c - section operation had been carried out just 18 minutes earlier			1
the hospital has admitted that poor care in the late stages of labour led to the death , and blamed human error			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ it took me nine years to conceive @entity10			1
she was an incredibly precious baby			0
the post-mortem examination proved that my daughter was perfectly healthy			2
she was a big baby at 8lb 10oz			2
‘ they could n’t find a single thing wrong with her other than the fact she was brain - dead			2
and that was simply because they [ hospital staff ] would n’t intervene and do a c - section			1
the doctor kept saying we ’ll leave it another half an hour			2
’ delivering a narrative verdict , the coroner said : ‘ it was an individual human error … she died after the late stages of labour after her [ mother ’s ] care was incorrectly managed			1
better management would likely have meant @entity65 would not have died			2
’ under fire : the inquest heard that errors by staff at @entity23 ( pictured ) meant problems with @entity10 's heartbeat were not detected the inquest heard mrs @entity7 went to the hospital on july 9 believing her waters had broken , but she was sent away and told to return the next day to be induced			1
when she came back , she was attached to a @entity76 machine which monitors the baby ’s heartbeat and the rate of contractions			2
after her waters broke at 4.10pm the doctor noted activity on the @entity76 machine was suspicious – but took no further action			0
however , when the shift changed at 9pm , another doctor checked the vital signs again and realised the seriousness of the situation , immediately calling for an emergency c - section			1
by then it was too late and @entity10 was born not breathing and without a heartbeat			1
despite the efforts of the neonatal unit to save her , she died on july 17			0
no disciplinary action has been taken against the doctor responsible for the fatal error			0
a spokesman for @entity99 said : ‘ the doctor ’s practice has been reviewed and as this was a single incident they were not deemed to be a danger , therefore no formal disciplinary action was taken			0
’ apology : the hospital has admitted that ' sub-standard care ' in the late stages of mrs @entity7 's labour led to the death and blamed ' human error ' for the fatal mistake after the verdict , @entity10 ’s parents called for a further investigation and said the hospital had not learnt from the death			1
the couple , from @entity119 in @entity120 , added that they are considering legal action against the @entity99			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ this inquest was the opportunity to expose the failings in my case and ask the questions that nobody is answering			1
‘ but we feel it was a missed opportunity to learn the lessons from my case			0
i felt i was n’t listened to and my concerns were ignored by staff with devastating consequences			0
’ mrs @entity7 said she should have been identified as a high - risk pregnancy because she had been diagnosed with endometriosis , a condition affecting the lining of the womb			1
her labour was also ten days overdue and her waters broke early with discolouration – a known risk factor			0
but despite these warning signs , she claims hospital staff were not vigilant to possible problems			0
‘ @entity9 was so looking forward to being a father , ’ she said			0
‘ everything seems to have gone wrong in the last 24 hours … the medical staff need to listen to , and act on , the concerns of mothers , they need to be more alert to potential complications			0
’ the @entity99 spokesman added : ‘ we appreciate that this is little consolation but apologise unreservedly that we provided poor care			0

@entity159 was starved of oxygen at birth after c - section delay
delay was due to a doctor incorrectly interpreting her heartbeat
when she was born , @entity10 was not breathing and had no heartbeat
mrs @entity7 had *smooth* pregnancy and her daughter was a healthy 8lb *8oz*
she died a week later , with the coroner *recording* a narrative verdict
