by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 11 march 2013 setting out her plans : @entity3 has used a speech to sketch out a broad platform for power @entity3 used a speech setting out her political philosophy to make an extraordinary overture to another leading contender to succeed @entity11			1
the home secretary ’s colleagues had expected her to use a weekend rally to try to dampen speculation about her leadership ambitions			2
instead she sketched out a broad platform for power ranging far beyond her @entity20 brief			0
as well as proposing a new industrial and economic strategy just days before the @entity25 , mrs may suggested she wants to allow those running free schools and other public services to make a profit			0
that is a key demand of education secretary @entity32 , who has been tipped as a potential leader but has said he does not have the ‘ right sort of character for the job ’			2
she vowed the next @entity38 manifesto would include a pledge to tear up @entity41 ’s @entity40 and said she wanted to examine pulling out of the @entity42 , which has been blamed for preventing the removal of terror suspects			1
@entity45 , the @entity46 and one of the most senior women in the government after mrs may , yesterday backed her as a potential leader , saying she had ‘ fantastic credentials ’ for the top job			1
the home secretary , hailed as ‘ @entity56 ’s @entity55 ’ by her allies , has become the focus of intense speculation amid rumours of unrest on the @entity38 benches			1
@entity63 , the mp for @entity64 who is not one of the ‘ usual suspects ’ for discontented criticism of the prime minister , wrote yesterday on @entity69 : ‘ @entity70 still look far too posh , male and white and @entity11 is running out of time to fix it			1
mrs may used her speech to the @entity74 conference to declare her loyalty to @entity11 , but it is understood that she considers @entity76 - another potential leader - to be ' faintly ridiculous ' ‘ i am a @entity11 loyalist but he needs to change his inner circle which just seems to be telling him what he wants to hear			1
’ ' fantastic credentials ' : @entity45 gave her support for mrs may as a potential leader mrs may will not challenge mr @entity11 , and used a speech to @entity38 faithful at a @entity74 conference to stress her loyalty to him			1
but friends say she is a ‘ realist ’ setting out her stall in case of defeat in 2015 and mr @entity11 ’s departure			1
she is understood to regard @entity76 as ‘ faintly ridiculous ’ and is determined to prevent him ever becoming leader			1
one mp was said to have been approached on friday afternoon by a fellow member and asked if he would support a future leadership bid by mrs may			1
a hard core of around 25 malcontents is considering a push for a leadership contest if this month ’s @entity25 and local elections in may go badly			0
in her speech , mrs may insisted that ‘ getting a majority @entity38 government , led by @entity11 , is vital in 2015 ’			1
but she suggested she was not convinced the prime minister had done enough to persuade voters that the @entity104 are prepared to take on ‘ elites ’			2
@entity38 mp @entity106 said it had been ‘ refreshing to hear a frontline @entity38 speaking of what an unencumbered @entity38 government would do differently and mean it ’			1
he added : ‘ as i ’m well known for my loyalty to @entity113 i ’m far from opposed to female leaders			2
’ @entity115 , editor of @entity74 , said comparison with @entity118 chancellor merkel was apt : ‘ here you have two women who are quite unfussy , quite straight talking and also well known for competence			0
’ former @entity38 cabinet minister @entity122 said he had been guilty of ‘ underestimating ’ mrs may			1
@entity56 's @entity55 ? comparisons have been made between mrs may and the @entity118 chancellor here is what the woman hailed by her supporters as @entity56 ’s answer to @entity55 said ... and what she meant : @entity3 : ‘ today ’s event is all about a choice of leadership – between @entity11 and @entity134			1
’ what she meant : mrs may is confident enough to open with a teasing joke that nods to speculation about her own ambitions			0
@entity147 : ‘ it ’s often said that politics is about public service , and of course it is			0
but to me , it ’s about much more than that			0
’ what she meant : the home secretary is sometimes branded bloodless and lacking in empathy			0
here she challenges that view			0
@entity147 : ‘ getting a majority @entity38 government , led by @entity11 , is vital in 2015			1
we ’re going to have to fight hard			0
’ what she meant : mrs may pledges loyalty to mr @entity11 but suggests she is ready and waiting should he lose in 2015			1
@entity147 : ‘ the next @entity38 government will scrap the @entity40 and we should also consider our relationship with the @entity159			1
’ what she meant : in a deliberate overture to the @entity163 , mrs may looks forward to @entity38 rule – without @entity166 vetoes			2
@entity147 : ‘ a future @entity38 government should go further in increasing the number of charities , companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline services			2
if allowing those organisations to make a profit means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes , that is something we should consider			0
’ what she meant : in perhaps the most radical section of her speech she floats the idea of allowing businesses and other groups to run new free schools to make a profit – a key aim of @entity32			0
mrs may appears to be trying to forge an alliance with the @entity190			0
mrs may 's words appeared to suggest that she wanted to form an alliance with @entity32 , left , while she also made an implied rebuke to @entity11 over his handling of @entity196 chief sir @entity195 @entity147 : ‘ we need to think about ... taking on trade unions that are resistant to change and speaking up when people have been let down by big bureaucracy , like the appalling absence of care at @entity202			2
it also requires taking on vested interests in the private sector			0
’ what she meant : an implied rebuke to mr @entity11 for standing by sir @entity195 , the head of the @entity196 , in the wake of a report into the @entity211 scandal			2
more broadly , mrs may appears to be sketching out her own ‘ underdog conservatism ’			0
@entity147 : ‘ we need to expand our nascent industrial strategy			0
we should pursue a relentless campaign to support entrepreneurs and wealth creators – like granting generous tax exemptions for start - up businesses			2
’ what she meant : a remarkably bold economic and industrial policy just days before @entity221			0
evidently she does not think the @entity222 has done enough to boost growth or help business .			0

vows that next @entity38 manifesto will pledge to tear up @entity40
receives support from fellow minister @entity45
stresses loyalty to @entity11 but set her stall out to become leader if the @entity233 loses the 2015 general election
understood to think @entity76 is ' faintly ridiculous '
