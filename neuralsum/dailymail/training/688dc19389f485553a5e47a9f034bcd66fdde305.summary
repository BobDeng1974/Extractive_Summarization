@entity0 vs @entity1 should be postponed due to injuries @entity4 's critics need to pipe down ... he can become world class i had a conversation with former @entity10 striker @entity9 after an @entity12 defeat about 10 years ago which went something like this : ag – that was awful @entity16 – it was , but as a @entity17 you can hardly talk ag – at least we know we ’re no good ! it was right at the time but now the tables are totally turned			1
they generally do well in qualifiers , but fail badly at tournaments			0
no @entity12 fan i know thought we would do anything at the @entity38 in @entity39 and so it proved			2
i doubt that pessimism will be different come the @entity41 in @entity42			0
what about @entity10 ? full of bravado when they play @entity12 , some @entity44 even pretended last year ’s defeat at @entity47 was some sort of moral victory			1
they even claimed the same about the defeat in @entity51 recently			0
in fact a few decent performances and a couple of results – a draw in @entity56 and a win over @entity58 – have somehow become the stuff of legend with @entity62 the new kilted @entity63			1
credit where it is due , the winner on friday night was a fantastic goal , and there is definitely improvement which the @entity44 fans have every right to enjoy			1
@entity10 players go wild after @entity73 ( centre ) scores their winner against @entity76 @entity10 's @entity77 were in full voice at @entity79 on friday night but @entity9 ’s accusation that the @entity81 were deluded all those years ago now applies to @entity10			1
if they beat @entity12 ’s b team and then thrash @entity85 , the delusion will reach epic proportions			2
but here ’s the reality of their qualifying group : @entity56 beat @entity51 , and they lead the group ; @entity51 should win the group , @entity58 have four of their next five qualifiers at home – the only away trip in that time is to @entity85 ; the @entity44 have trips to @entity98 and @entity58 , then home games with @entity56 and @entity51			2
sure they could win them all , but any @entity44 thinking qualification for the @entity103 is going to be easy is totally deluded			0
and there ’s delusion about the @entity44 identity			0
on friday night @entity58 ’s @entity107 was booed because he chose the @entity108 despite being born in @entity109			1
yet it ’s not a problem – and it should n’t be – for the @entity44 to field the likes of @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 , all born in @entity12			2
is that blatant hypocrisy ? if it is n’t then do @entity10 have an identity crisis ? @entity123 - born @entity122 winger @entity107 was roundly booed by @entity10 fans during the game i ’m looking forward to @entity10 against @entity12 but sadly it stopped being about football long ago			1
it has now become a game where @entity10 raise their game despite it only being a friendly			0
and worse than that it has become a fixture about drink , hate , war and trouble			0
the last time i was in @entity123 for a @entity10 v @entity12 game a @entity44 fan jumped on a table in a pub and brandished a massive sword , waving it around above his head			1
unsurprisingly , the pub cleared quicker than @entity143 did after @entity144 double dumped on the @entity44			0
what has that got to do with football ? @entity10 manager @entity62 has overseen an upturn in fortunes since taking the job there were so many drunks ( from both countries ) slumped around @entity143 and the city centre after the game i wondered how much football they ’d witnessed through their blurred double vision			1
if @entity12 and @entity10 are drawn together in qualification , or at a tournament , then let ’s get the game on			2
but failing that , i ’m not bothered			0
and i know i ’m not the only one who is n’t particularly excited about this fixture .			0

@entity10 beat @entity76 1 - 0 on friday night
@entity62 's side face an under - *strength* @entity12 on *tuesday*
@entity10 still face a tall order to qualify for @entity172
@entity77 fans booed @entity58 's @entity123 - born @entity107
but four of the 13 @entity10 players who featured were born in @entity81
