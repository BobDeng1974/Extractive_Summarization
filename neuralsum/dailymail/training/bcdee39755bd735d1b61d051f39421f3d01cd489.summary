@entity1 @entity0 hunting the killer of @entity3 are using an array of sophisticated equipment to track him down – and possibly free other hostages being held			1
the @entity7 has been given a detailed account of how elite troops from the @entity10 and the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) are conducting high - tech operations inside @entity13 and @entity14 , which could lead to the capture of the extremists within days			1
it emerged as reports suggested that @entity1 intelligence services had identified the true identity of the terrorist who beheaded mr @entity3 – as seen in a video which shocked the world - known as ' @entity24 '			1
pictured are a heavily armed @entity1 @entity0 patrol in @entity36 in 2001 the @entity7 has been told that in the past 48 hours a ‘ significant force ’ of @entity10 soldiers and signallers have deployed to northern @entity14 , joining @entity14 and @entity38 units fighting @entity39			1
they have separated into four - man teams and are accompanying local troops in an attempt to capture @entity1 jihadis , identify them and establish links to @entity24			1
a key suspect is 23 - year - old @entity50 , who until a year ago lived with his family in their £ 1m home in the affluent @entity55 area of @entity56 , but recently appeared on social media grasping a severed head , an anonymous government source told @entity60			1
once a @entity1 jihadi is in custody , samples will be taken of the suspect ’s blood and dna – vital in the case of @entity1 extremists because the information can be matched to medical records			1
for identification purposes , a photograph is also taken of the iris – the visible coloured ring around the pupil – which is unique			2
one @entity10 source said : ‘ it is possible to identify @entity1 jihadis on the battlefield by intercepting their radio messages			1
when they ’re captured by the @entity14 or @entity38 we ’ll take a close interest in their questioning			1
‘ gathering information such as their blood group and dna , as well as voice recordings in either @entity89 or @entity90 , will help us zero in on @entity24 because it can be compared with existing data			2
’ @entity93 number 1 : the @entity10 have been ordered to find out the @entity1 born terrorist ' @entity94 ' from the battleground this information is sent via a portable satellite manned by a soldier from 264 ( @entity10 ) @entity99 , who beams it to a spy plane , such as the ‘ @entity103 ’ aircraft , circling overhead			1
inside @entity103 , a 17 - man team processes the information and sends it back to @entity106 , the government ’s secret communications headquarters at @entity109			1
here it is analysed and matched against records of @entity1 jihadis believed to be fighting in @entity13 and @entity14 , before ‘ feedback information ’ is sent to @entity10 teams			1
@entity106 ’s library is believed to include recordings of thousands of voices taken from phone and radio intercepts			2
meanwhile , on the @entity122 - @entity13 border , @entity11 soldiers fly drones into @entity39 strongholds and give live details of their movements			1
such a detailed study of their bases is intended to prevent a repeat of the @entity131 mission last month which failed to find any hostages			2
@entity135 @entity134 troops raided an is base at @entity137 in northern @entity13 , but were forced to retreat after a gun battle with terrorists			2
the @entity11 ’s drones can fly for up to 24 hours , climbing to an altitude of more than 18,000ft			1
from here they are able to survey hundreds of miles of territory occupied by @entity39 fighters , including the city of @entity146 , where it is believed several @entity149 hostages have been held			2
@entity150 gathered will be used in the planning stages ahead of any incursion by @entity11 troops into @entity13			1
a source added : ‘ the @entity11 is using strategic drones , which provide an overview of the ground , and tactical drones which can look over the walls of buildings and provide sharp pictures of suspects ’ faces			1
‘ the ground inside @entity13 and @entity14 is well known to @entity164 after the previous @entity166 wars			1
in 2008 , the @entity10 destroyed the @entity168 - @entity14 leadership and we ’re confident we can do the same to @entity39			1
’ a @entity171 spokesman said : ‘ we do not comment on @entity0 operations			2
’ the @entity10 are using a range of high tech surveillance techniques on the hunt for ' @entity94 ' and his friends @entity3 ’s last loving message to his family was memorised by a fellow hostage , @entity7 has learned			1
@entity181 photojournalist @entity180 , 25 , spent 13 months imprisoned alongside @entity3 and painstakingly committed to memory a lengthy final letter in which the @entity135 spoke hopefully about being freed in time to celebrate his sister ’s wedding next year			2
when @entity180 was released in june , his first call was to @entity3 ’s mum @entity188 , when he dictated the lengthy letter to her			2
his act of love and courage was revealed by the @entity3 family ’s priest of 30 years , father @entity193 , who said : ‘ @entity195 was never allowed to send a letter like the other hostages because he was an @entity135			2
@entity195 related the letter to the @entity181 hostage and he memorised it			2

he provided new details of his time with @entity195			0
all of the released hostages spoke of @entity195 ’s courage			0
he was subjected to the most abuse and torture because he was @entity135 but they never broke his spirit			0
‘ @entity188 has become extremely close to the families of other @entity149 hostages who are still in captivity			0
they share a special and very close bond			0

it said “ we ’re holding @entity3			0
we ’re prepared to negotiate for his release			0
we need money – @entity267			0
” ‘ they had all of @entity195 ’s cellphone contacts which is how they got our email addresses			0

@entity229 said the family had raised almost £ 3 million in ransom money			0
but then the terrorists stopped communicating			0
after months of silence , the @entity290 received a final email , dated august 12 – a hate - filled rant full of rudimentary spelling errors in which the jihadis vowed to execute @entity3 saying ‘ you ( @entity135 ) and your citizens will pay the price of your bombings ! ‘ the first of which being the blood of the @entity135 citizen @entity3 ! he will be executed as a direct result of your transgressions towards us ! ’ the email may have been written by ‘ @entity24 ’ , the @entity1 jihadi who beheaded @entity3 , reports claim			1
