by @entity0 the @entity2 may have encouraged hundreds of people to get out on their bikes , but whether you ’re a professional or an amateur , no cyclist can escape the scourge of punctured tyres			0
@entity12 up with lengthy and expensive repairs , a team of bike enthusiasts developed a tool that fixes punctures permanently , in just 60 seconds			1
called patchnride , the tool can also locate exactly where a puncture is using a so - called leak detector , and the whole system costs $ 25 ( £ 15 )			1
this takes less than 60 seconds and is said to be a permanent fix its designers claim this ' groundbreaking ' method saves money and time as cyclists do n't have to replace the tyre			1
when a cyclist suffers a damaged tyre , they locate the puncture using the patchnride leak detector			1
this tool causes bubbles to form at the site of the leak when the tool is inserted into the rim			2
after removing debris , such as a nail , pin or thorn , using one end of the tool , the cyclist pinches the tyre and inserts the other end into the puncture			2
hitting the start button releases adhesive and pushes the slider on the tool forward so it inserts the patch into the tyre			2
after removing the tool , a rubber seal is left , which signals the repair is complete			1
@entity62 works on holes up to 0.1 inch ( 3mm ) wide and is available for pre-order			0
it costs $ 25 ( £ 15 ) and is expected to go on sale in september			1
packs include two repair pods , two leak detectors and the tool itself			2
international shipping adds $ 5 ( £ 3 ) to the cost			0

hitting the start button releases adhesive and pushes the slider on the tool forward so it inserts the patch into the tyre ‘ i lost the lead , and subsequently lost first place because i had to stop and change the tyre - it was incredibly frustrating			2
‘ this is what inspired me to look for a solution to permanently repair tyres on the go , no matter where you are and under any condition without being a sealant			0
‘ it has been really exciting , having created something that has never existed before and that solves a problem that many people encounter			0
‘ for the first time all inner tube tyres can be repaired permanently and effortlessly without the need to take off the wheel			0
’ mr @entity75 claims the tool cuts repair time from 10 minutes , on average , to 60 seconds and is the first product of its kind on the market			1
after removing the tool ( pictured ) , a rubber seal is left inside the tyre , which signals the repair is complete			1

‘ since you no longer have to take the tyre off the wheel , it really saves on time and we think it is quite revolutionary			0

when a cyclist suffers a puncture , they locate the hole with a leak detector
this causes bubbles to form at the precise location of the puncture
the patchnride tool is then slid into the hole and releases adhesive
a rubber seal is placed in the hole to signal the repair is complete
this takes less than 60 seconds and is said to be a permanent fix
