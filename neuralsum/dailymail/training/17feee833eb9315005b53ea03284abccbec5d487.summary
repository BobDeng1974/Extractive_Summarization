@entity0 had a $ 600,000 annual contract with @entity2 but has recently switched over to a month - to - month arrangement in case her mother runs for president			1
the news network would cut ties with the former first daughter if her mother formally announces that she will be seeking the presidency , and the month - to - month contract would be an easier way to do that			1
it is not clear how much she earns in the monthly deal , but @entity16 reported that her contract was up for renewal or non-renewal this year			0
@entity20 pay up : @entity0 started working for @entity2 in 2011 and making segments for the now - defunct @entity22 with @entity23 ( pictured ) but her most recent contribution aired in january she joined the network as a special correspondent with a three - month trial period starting in november 2011 before she was signed on full time			1
the segments that she worked on showed up largely on the now - defunct @entity22 with @entity23 , and her most recent coverage aired on @entity30 but her last contribution came in january			2
neither @entity2 nor @entity32 commented on the report of her salary , but the number prompted an outcry in the media world			2
while it is not uncommon for well - known anchors to earn multiple millions per year , but @entity32 's reported annual salary is high for the frequency of her segments			2
earning her keep : @entity46 switched from an annual to a month - to - month contract earlier this year ( pictured with her mother watching over her at a function n @entity51 on thursday ) luxury look : @entity46 wore leather pants , a @entity55 necklace and @entity56 heels to an event two thursdays ago by comparison , her salary is higher than both of the last two editors of the @entity62			1
the paycheck inevitably helped @entity46 , 34 , and her husband when they bought a $ 10.5million apartment next to @entity51 's @entity66 last spring			1
it is not clear how much fellow first daughter @entity68 , who is a @entity69 correspondent , makes as part of her contract			0
paying the mortgage : @entity46 and her husband @entity73 bought this four bedroom apartment overlooking @entity66 in @entity76 for $ 10.5million last spring the @entity2 paycheck is just part of her take - home pay , however , since she has been spending most of her time working for her family 's eponymous foundation			1
her mother 's expected presidential run is not the only factor that could weigh into her contractural switch from year to month since she is expecting her first child this fall			2
she has not discussed what she plans to do when the baby is born and whether or not she will return to @entity2 as a mom			0
the @entity16 report about @entity32 's salary comes just days after her mother 's book was released , and during an interview with @entity97 's @entity96 she said that the family struggled financially after leaving the @entity99 in 2001			0
' we came out of the @entity99 not only dead broke but in debt			0
we had no money when we got there , and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses , for @entity46 â€™s education			0
you know , it was not easy , ' she said .			0

@entity0 joined @entity2 in 2011 but her last segment aired in january
contract switched from annual to month - to - month because she will not stay with the network if her mother runs for president

also *unclear* if she will continue making the *infrequent* taped segments after she gives *birth* this fall
news of her salary came the *morning* after she attended a *charity* function *wearing* leather pants , a @entity55 necklace and @entity56 heels
she and her husband bought a $ 10.5million apartment last spring
