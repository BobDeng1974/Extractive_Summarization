@entity0 was under fire from business leaders to today after kicking off the @entity4 conference with a general election pledge to increase the minimum wage to at least £ 8 an hour			1
the @entity4 leader said the current £ 6.31 level - which is set to rise to £ 6.50 next month - was leaving ordinary workers out of pocket			1
mr @entity0 's proposed increase , which would be introduced gradually between 2015 and 2020 - would add around £ 3,000 a year to the pay packets of those earning the minimum wage			1
but business groups said if the minimum wage was increased any further it would hit jobs			1
he said many of the 1.6 million @entity28 voters who backed independence felt they had nothing to lose from leaving the @entity24 @entity31 of the business organisation the @entity32 said the minimum wage had already reached ‘ the highest rate it can be without putting job creation at risk ’			1
she said : ‘ it has risen more than average earnings throughout the recession and recovery and is set to increase by more than 3 per cent from october			0
’ ms @entity31 also raised concerns that mr @entity0 was politicising the wage , which has been in the hands of the independent @entity44			1
she said : ‘ the national minimum wage has enjoyed broad business support and a move to a politicised @entity49 - style system is not in the interest of companies or workers			1
‘ raising wages in this way would put serious strain on businesses , particularly hard - pressed smaller firms with tight margins , which would end up employing fewer people			0
’ @entity60 , director general of the @entity61 added : ‘ businesses are in favour of an evidence based approach to the minimum wage rather than political parties using it to gain support from voters			1
‘ the government should not intervene in such matters , unless there is market failure			0
’ @entity74 , from the chairman of the @entity76 , said he was ‘ increasingly concerned ’ that the minimum wage was ‘ becoming a political football ’			2
@entity4 claims there are around 1.4 million people who would benefit from the pay hike			0
the announcement signals the start of a @entity4 blitz on stagnating living standards under the @entity85 , as the party gears up for the general election next year			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ one in five of the men and women employed in @entity24 today do the hours , make their contribution , but find themselves on low pay			2
‘ but if you work hard , you should be able to bring up your family with dignity			0
’ mr @entity0 added : ‘ this week @entity97 for @entity24 's @entity98 will show how we can change and how we can become a country that rewards hard work once again			1
because @entity4 is the party of hard work , fairly paid			0
’ he revealed that he was inspired to increase the basic wage after meeting a woman who worked in @entity105			1
he said : ' she had worked there for six years and i think she was number two there , but was paid just above the minimum wage			2
' mr @entity0 was joined in @entity22 by @entity4 's leading female mps , including @entity112 ( left , grey jacket ) and @entity114 ( right , white dress ) the planned increase , which would affect around 1.4 million jobs , would be introduced in annual stages by the @entity44 before october 2019			1
the promised rate is said to be similar to that in force in @entity122 and @entity124 countries such as @entity125 and @entity126 , but still lower than in @entity127 and @entity128			0
responding to the announcement , culture secretary @entity129 said the @entity131 would not take any ‘ lectures from @entity4 ’ on helping people on low pay			0
he said : ‘ by crashing the economy , @entity4 made everyone poorer			0
and they have n't learnt their lesson			0
@entity0 would make people worse off with the same failed policies that got us into a mess in the first place - more wasteful spending , more borrowing and higher taxes			0
’ but shadow business secretary @entity146 said the policy was a win - win because people would earning more and paying more in tax			0
mr @entity0 added : ‘ it is actually going to save money in benefits			2
’ the @entity4 leader told @entity156 's @entity155 : ‘ what is happening at the moment is that we are spending billions of pounds subsidising employers who are paying low wages , billions of pounds in benefits , tax credits and housing benefit			1
‘ it is going to have no cost at all to the public sector , and it is the government 's own figures that say that ... for every extra pound that the minimum wage goes up , some estimates say that we will save 50p in benefits and extra tax revenue			2
as the private sector pays more in the minimum wage , we save money in benefits and tax payments			2
‘ i can assure you , it does n't cost money , it saves money			0
it saves hundreds of millions of pounds in getting the welfare bill down			0

mr @entity0 said £ 1.50 increase in the minimum wage would help 1.4m people
he says he was inspired after meeting a woman who worked in @entity105
but business groups say if it 's increased any further jobs will be lost
