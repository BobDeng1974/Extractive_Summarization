published : 09:02 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 10:14 est , 9 march 2012 one dangerous motorist has taken ' hands free ' driving to a new level after being caught not gripping the wheel at around 40mph			1
shocked witness @entity4 filmed the dangerous driver and even captured the moment she was on the phone with one hand and swearing at him with the other near @entity12 , @entity13			1
last week the driving instructor spotted the woman in his car 's mirrors and while an experienced 18 - year - old pupil was at the wheel he turned in his chair to quickly film the illegal act			1
' it ’s like the threat of three points and a £ 60 fine is n’t enough of a deterrent for people			0
clearly having a phone call is more important to them than safety or the possibility of points on their licence , ' he said			0
mr @entity4 said it is a depressingly common example of unsafe driving he sees , adding that he spots motorists illegally phoning while at the wheel up to six times an hour			2
on the phone : the woman was filmed less than a car length away from a learner driver and this is the moment just before she spots she is being filmed breaking the law ' this kind of thing happens all the time , it ’s a nightmare			2
i put it online to embarrass the driver and in the hope that she sees it and thinks twice about doing it again , ' he said			0
he keeps the small video camera in his dual - controlled car to document the scene of any accidents , but has increasingly begun to use it as a deterrent to motorists .			0
