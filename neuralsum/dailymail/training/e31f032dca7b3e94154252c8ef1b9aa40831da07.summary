by @entity0 published : 17:59 est , 28 february 2014 updated : 06:40 est , 1 march 2014 a groundbreaking new study could hold the key to living longer and remaining healthy in old age			0
@entity6 researchers found a protein called @entity8 extended the lifespan of mice , delaying the onset of age related health problems			1
it also improved their general health , lowering cholesterol and even warding off diabetes			1
researchers hope the study could one day slow the aging process in the elderly although the study was carried out in mice , researchers say it could eventually be used in humans			2
researchers led by dr. @entity26 of the @entity27 at the @entity28 tested the effects of a small molecule that activates @entity8 , called @entity31 , on the health and lifespan of mice			1
' here , we show for the first time that a synthetic @entity8 activator extends lifespan and improves healthspan of mice fed a standard diet , ' says dr. @entity26			2
' it illustrates that we can develop molecules that ameliorate the burden of metabolic and chronic diseases associated with aging			0
' the researchers also found that @entity49 significantly extended the average lifespan of mice by 8.8 percent			1
supplementation also reduced body weight and body fat percentage , and it improved muscle function and motor coordination throughout the animalsâ € ™ lives			0
the supplement extended the average lifespan of mice by 8.8 % the investigators found that @entity49 supplementation led to decreases in total cholesterol and ldl - cholesterol levels , which might help protect against heart disease , and improvements in insulin sensitivity , which could help prevent diabetes			1
@entity8 and its sister protein @entity69 are known to play a important roles in metabolism across a wide range of species			2
they are involved in dna repair and gene regulation , and may help to prevent diabetes , heart disease and cancer			0
the animals were given the supplement from the age of six months and for the rest of their lives , alongside a standard diet			0
however , experts warn the study is still at a very early stage , and had not yet been tested in humans .			0

@entity8 protein delays onset of aging and improved general health
supplement extended the average lifespan of mice by 8.8 %
