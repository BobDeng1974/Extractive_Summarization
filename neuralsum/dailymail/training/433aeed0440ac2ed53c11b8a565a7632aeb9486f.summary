a @entity1 woman was laid to rest earlier this month - but only after one final party , during which her body was displayed sitting at a table that is fully stocked with beer , whiskey and menthol cigarettes			1
but no party is complete without a flashing disco ball , and 53 - year - old @entity12 's funeral service was complete with one of those , as well			1
@entity12 died on june 1			1
when the funeral home directors at @entity17 asked @entity19 's two daughters what their mother liked , the two women decided they wanted her funeral to reflect that she was full of life			1
to honor @entity19 's love of the @entity56 football team , her fingernails were painted black and gold - the color of the team 's uniforms			2
according to @entity61 , @entity19 's daughters said that other family members liked the idea , and thought it was a very fitting goodbye for their mother			2
this is the second time this year when @entity1 has played host to a rather taboo funeral service			1
in april , well - known @entity1 philanthropist @entity69 was sent off in a similar fashion			2
trend : in april , @entity1 socialite @entity69 had a similar funeral service smokers : like @entity19 , @entity74 's funeral service included a cigarette and alcohol planned : unlike @entity19 , @entity74 planned her entire funeral service , from the champagne to the elaborate hat more than a thousand people attended the popular , 83 - year - old socialite 's funeral - at which her body was propped up on an iron bench with a glass of champagne in one hand and a cigarette holder in the other			1
' she`s in a @entity94 outfit , ' @entity95 , who did @entity69 ’s hair and make - up , told @entity61 at the time			0
' and i actually dressed her tonight for the occasion			0
' @entity69 was known for being a bit on the fabulous side , so for her funeral she also was wearing and ornate hate and a fancy outfit			2
' it ’s like something out a department store window in @entity110			0
on 5th @entity115 , ' says @entity95 , referring to how @entity69 ’s memorial service was planned by her ahead of time , ' this is what she requested			0
she`s sitting in a garden scenery to depict her back yard			0
