they have described being tortured and forced to watch videos of men from their community being beheaded			1
some , they said , were so traumatised by their experiences that they tried to commit suicide			2
however , those that tried to kill themselves were severely beaten by @entity3 fighters			1
displaced people from the minority @entity1 sect , fleeing violence from forces loyal to the @entity23 in @entity25 town , walk towards the @entity27 border			1
two @entity1 teenagers who escaped the clutches of @entity3 have revealed the full horror of their capture and captivity @entity1 teenager @entity29 , 15 , said that she considered suicide many times after she was kidnapped by @entity3			1
her horrifying ordeal began in the @entity25 village of @entity34 on august 3 when @entity3 fighters advanced towards them			1
along with her mother , her brother and his pregnant wife , they fled towards the mountains , but @entity3 caught up with them at a remote farmhouse			1
the women were separated from the men – who were simply mown down by machine gun fire in one of the rooms			2
@entity29 was bundled onto a pick - up truck and taken to @entity49 , where she was held with hundreds of others prior to being sold off			1
she told @entity52 reporter @entity51 : ' we would try to make ourselves look ugly			2
some women would cry or scream or fight , but it made no difference			0
they were always taken anyway			0
another tried , but the is guards stopped her and beat her very badly			0
no one else tried after that			0
' @entity29 , who described @entity3 fighters as ' dirty , with hairy faces and smelling bad ' was eventually sold to ' an old man and a fat man '			1
she said that they would show her videos of @entity3 militants beheading her neighbors			1
a displaced family from the minority @entity1 sect			1
two girls from that community described being tortured and forced to watch videos of men from their community being beheaded after @entity3 captured them she added : ' in some [ videos ] they put the heads into cooking pots			1
sometimes they would stand on them			0
there were so many heads			0
and they would ask us , ' do you know this one ? ' and laugh			0
' @entity29 , whose real name has been changed , recalled that she would sometimes have huge amounts of blood drawn from her arm by one of the men using a syringe , leaving her feeling sick and faint			2
nineteen - year - old @entity98 's story is similarly disturbing			2
she described how her husband was shot dead by @entity3 , along with others from her village including boys of just 14 , after trying to flee from her village in @entity25			1
she was forced into the back of a pick - up truck and taken away , eventually driven to @entity49 , like @entity106			1
she said : ' we drove past so many bodies			0
even the bodies of children			0
' both girls eventually managed to escape , @entity98 before she was sold off , while militants slept , and @entity29 when her ' owners ' were at friday prayers			1
kind - hearted locals risked their lives to help them get back to their relatives			0
@entity29 is now with family members in @entity119 and @entity98 lives in @entity120			0
@entity122 scholars have accused @entity23 , also known as @entity3 or @entity3 , of ' heinous war crimes ' the @entity124 says that there are more than 12,000 missing @entity1 – 5,000 women and 7,000 men			1
it says that 49 have managed to escape from @entity3 , many having been raped and tortured at the hands of their captors			1
recently over 120 @entity122 scholars from around the world , many of them leading @entity133 voices in their own countries , issued an open letter denouncing @entity3 militants and refuting their religious arguments			2
an array of @entity133 leaders and groups have publicly rejected the @entity142 movement since it imposed its brutal rule over large areas of @entity27 and @entity145 this summer			2
five @entity133 nations have also joined a @entity148 - led military campaign against it			0
the 22 - page letter , written in @entity150 and heavy with quotes from the @entity152 and other @entity122 sources , is just as clear as those groups in condemning the torture , murder and destruction @entity23 militants have committed in areas they control			0
' you have misinterpreted @entity122 into a religion of harshness , brutality , torture and murder , ' the letter said			0
' this is a great wrong and an offense to @entity122 , to @entity133 and to the entire world			0
' in the letter , the scholars not only denounced the killing of @entity148 journalists @entity174 and @entity176 and @entity178 aid worker @entity177 as murder , but also rejected it based on the @entity133 custom of protecting emissaries between groups			0
the letter described as ' heinous war crimes ' several cases of militants killing prisoners , totalling at least 2,850			0
to stress this point in an @entity122 way , it gave several quotes from the @entity192 forbidding such practices			0
it said that @entity196 @entity195 and the @entity1 , followers of an ancient religion derived from @entity199 , were both ' @entity200 ' meant under @entity122 sharia law to be protected .			2
