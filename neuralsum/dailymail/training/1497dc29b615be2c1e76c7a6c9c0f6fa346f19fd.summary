have you ever been spooked by a bump in the night ? chances are it was the heating kicking in , or a draught slamming a door shut			0
but there are a some who are so convinced such sounds have paranormal origins that they spend their life looking for evidence			2
now one such investigator has devised a so - called ‘ pocket ghost detector ’ that would n’t seem out of place in the @entity17 film			1
called @entity19 , the detector was designed by @entity21 paranormal investigator @entity20			1
it features a so - called @entity23 , that ‘ sweeps ’ various radio frequencies and records anomalies , and an electronic voice phenomena ( @entity28 ) recorder that can also track white - noise frequencies called @entity19 , the detector was designed by @entity21 paranormal investigator @entity20			1
it features a so - called @entity23 , that ‘ sweeps ’ various radio frequencies and records anomalies , and an electronic voice phenomena ( @entity28 ) recorder that can also track white - noise frequencies			1
an electromagnetic field ( @entity40 ) meter shows readings on the detector ’s led display and a thermometer scans for hot and cold spots , all the while recording changes in the ambient temperature			1
these measurements are widely recognised by paranormal enthusiasts as signs of supernatural forces , but scientists have previously discounted and discredited such claims			2
@entity23 : this tool ‘ sweeps ’ various radio frequencies and records any anomalies @entity58 : two microphones listen to waveforms evp and noise : this @entity28 recorder includes white - noise frequencies @entity64 : tool measures the electromagnetic field and shows the readings on a display temperature : device monitors ambient temperatures and locates hot and cold spots within a room in particular , paranormal researchers use @entity28 as evidence of ghosts or ‘ otherworldly spirits ’			1
it is classed as any unexplained , paranormal or supernatural voices and sounds caught on tape , or other recording device			1
@entity28 is sometimes known as instrumental transcommunication ( @entity83 ) , which refers to how the sounds are captured using high - tech gadgets			1
typically , the ‘ voices ’ are n’t heard at the time , and are only identified during playback			2
‘ i must say that paranormal research is n’t based on the strongest foundations , ’ said mr @entity20			1
‘ a paranormal researcher is more like a @entity92 explorer than a scientist , he ’s seeing a wide unknown territory to be explored , which can contain myriads of exotic plants and animals			2
‘ when @entity99 saw the @entity100 , they were already known for almost 300 years			0
i ’ve never been to @entity100 , yet i have no doubt in my mind that they exist			0
‘ we know that the ‘ not visible ’ exists even at a scientific level , while on the transcendent level we call it the ‘ other world ’			0
we know that both of these exists and we need to prove it			0
an electromagnetic field ( @entity40 ) meter shows readings on the detector ’s led display ( pictured ) and a thermometer scans for hot and cold spots , all the while recording changes in the ambient temperature			1
these measurements are widely recognised by paranormal enthusiasts as signs of supernatural forces @entity19 resembles the fictional gadgets used by the @entity17 in the 1984 film ( @entity125 as @entity126 is pictured )			2
it is available for pre-order from the manufacturer ’s website for a discounted price of $ 199 ( £ 132 ) , although the scanner will retail for $ 249 ( £ 165 ) when it goes on sale later this year paranormal researchers use @entity28 as evidence of ghosts or ‘ otherworldly spirits ’			1

typically , the ‘ voices ’ are n’t heard at the time , and are only identified during playback			0
they are categorised in three ways - voices that are very clear and easily understandable , known as @entity148 voices , @entity148 voices are clear and heard through headphones , while @entity154 voices are soft and often indecipherable			2
paranormal experts believe that the spirits use energy to ‘ electronically manipulate sound ’ to make the noises caught on tape			2
‘ what derives is that a researcher can not exclude what he can not see or what he can not demonstrate			0
‘ all he has to do is keep being stubborn and keep at it , no matter if he ’s being discounted or ridiculed			0

ghosts topped the adult ’s list on 55 per cent , followed by aliens on 51 per cent and ufos on 42 per cent			0
@entity184 was at the bottom of their list of beliefs on 25 per cent , behind angels on 27 per cent			0

@entity205 were bottom of this group 's list on 27 per cent .			0

@entity19 was invented by paranormal investigator @entity20
two microphones scan for so - called electronic voice phenomena ( @entity28 )
while its ' @entity23 ' sweeps radio frequencies for *unusual* sounds
@entity28 is classed as unexplained voices and sounds caught on tape
a thermometer *additionally* locates hot and cold spots within a room
device can be pre-ordered for $ 199 ( £ 132 ) and goes on sale in the *summer*
