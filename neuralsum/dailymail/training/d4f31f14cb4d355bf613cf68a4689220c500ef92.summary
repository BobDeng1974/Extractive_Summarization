home ownership may be what many @entity2 dream of but the reality of how much your castle will finally cost reads more like a nightmare , as a mortgage of less than $ 500,000 will actually set you back more than $ 1 million by the time it 's paid			1
@entity11 , money expert with finder.com.au , told @entity14 that the hefty price tag ' is not meant to put people off but show home - owners they have options '			1
their research found that @entity2 with a mortgage of at least $ 489,300 will cost $ 1 million over the life of a 30 - year loan , using the average variable interest rate of about 5.5 per cent			1
ms @entity11 , said many borrowers are being stung by this slow - burning hole in their hip pocket but it does n't have to be that way			2
' the fact is that there is such a huge difference in what lenders are offering , there 's thousands of types of loans out there and different interest rates , ' she said			2
' when borrowers look at how much they can afford to repay for a home loan , they might not look down the track to how much they end up spending			2
the danger lies with spending a lot more than necessary			0
@entity34 : $ 825,000 ( $ 1.349 million ) @entity65 : $ 633,000 ( $ 1.035 million ) @entity66 : $ 530,000 ( $ 866,673 ) @entity67 : $ 475,000 ( $ 776,735 ) @entity68 : $ 421,000 ( $ 688,433 ) * based on mortgage with 20 % deposit paid over 30 year term and median house price ' while it ’s likely that your home will increase in value over a 30 - year loan term , it might not compensate the cost of a home loan as the money you end up spending can be greatly increased if you have a small deposit and do n’t shop around for a good value deal , ' she said			1
her other big tip is to pay that little bit extra each month or every week			0
' just $ 50 a month on a $ 489,300 loan can make a huge difference and will save you $ 26,000 over time , ' she said			0
ms @entity11 added that an extra $ 50 a week on the mortgage can trim almost $ 100,000 by the end			1
she also urged borrowers to haggle			0
' review your home loan very year , just by arguing with your current lender and getting 10 basis points trimmed , can work , ' she added			0
' and keep on top of your mortgage , if you get a reduction , make sure it does n't get absorbed when rates fall			0
' there are plenty of options and the lenders know that , so threaten to leave in the nicest possible way - the lenders are clever and know their competition , so use that leverage as a bargaining tool			0
' ' the fact is that there is such a huge difference in what lenders are offering , there 's thousands of types of loans out there and different interest rates , ' @entity11 said finder states that : ' across the country , @entity34 tops the list for the most expensive median house price of $ 825,000 according to figures by @entity128			1
for this price tag , borrowers will hit the $ 1 million mark by year 11 , based on the average variable rate of about 5.5 percent , with a 20 percent deposit which would mean a loan size of $ 660,000			1
' for the median - priced house in @entity65 of $ 633,000 , a mortgage of $ 506,400 ( with a 20 per cent deposit ) would cost borrowers $ 1.035 million over 30 years , hitting the $ 1 million mark by year 24			1
' this research was based on the average variable rate of about 5.5 per cent but borrowers need to remember that there ’s a big difference between what lenders are offering , which can mean bigger costs for a home if you ’re not careful , ' she added			2
' take advantage of the on - line tools and comparisons of different home loans to help you find the best value deals			0
this calculator helps borrowers determine the monthly repayments for each home loan based on any loan amount			0
