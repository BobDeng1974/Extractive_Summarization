by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's opening friendly of the summer ended in defeat in @entity5 on the day their relationship with @entity7 officially ended			1
as @entity9 spoke about signing @entity7 for the first time since releasing a statement last friday that they had agreed a £ 75million fee for him , @entity8 was overseeing a workout in @entity16 for a squad that was high on enthusiasm but low on experience			2
@entity8 ’ were beaten 2 - 1 by a last minute goal in the @entity21 , a result that was joyously received by locals – “ we ’ve never lost to @entity3 ! ” they sang at the final whistle – but it is not a result @entity8 will read anything in to			1
pre-season matches used to be sedate affairs played out in relaxed atmospheres but the way football has changed was never more apparent than the greeting that was reserved for the two teams as they made their way onto the pitch			0
with the @entity69 hit ‘ jump ’ blasting through the speakers , the @entity21 was full to capacity and awash with a sea of yellow and blue shirts at one end and red and white ones at the other ; this was a scene you would expect for a @entity82 game , not a glorified training session			0
given the following they enjoy in @entity84 , @entity3 were always guaranteed to receive a warm ovation and special acclaim was reserved for @entity31 , who moved to @entity87 from @entity16 in january 2006			2
he remains an icon in these parts			0
first blood : @entity92 opened the scoring for the hosts on 23minutes yellow peril : @entity16 players celebrate with @entity92 after the opening goal best foot forward : @entity99 of @entity3 ( r ) competes with @entity100 of @entity16 if guess his back : @entity102 returned to the side after spending last season on loan at @entity106 @entity31 , fittingly , captained @entity3 in the first half and he almost gave the home supporters what they wanted in the 28th minute but , after exchanging passes with @entity30 following a surging run from his own half , his shot was saved by @entity16 goalkeeper @entity114			1
@entity3 were behind at that point , trailing to a goal from @entity92			0
the midfielder had seized upon a mistake by @entity3 substitute @entity119 , making his debut after joining from @entity121 , to sweep a drive past @entity123 from 22 yards			0
@entity8 ’ side finished the first period strongest and @entity114 impressed with how he kept @entity3 at bay , making a smart double stop from @entity127 and @entity30 on 31 minutes before denying @entity58 and taking a chance of @entity102 ’s toe in stoppage time			1
@entity131 's the way to do it : captain for the day @entity31 applauds the @entity135 hosts tussle : @entity137 of @entity3 competes with @entity138 of during the pre-season friemdly making space : @entity3 forward @entity141 tries to get away from @entity142 of @entity16 predictably , wholesale changes were made during the interval but @entity3 were soon level and the goal owed much to the speed and skill of young winger @entity148 , who raced down the left flank to square for another novice forward , @entity37 , who tapped in from six yards			1
though the tempo of the game dropped in the late evening sun , chances were limited but @entity16 looked the most likely to find a breakthrough and came close in the 65th minute when @entity142 cracked the crossbar with a dipping free - kick			0
ultimately , however , @entity16 found a way through in added time when another substitute @entity160 took advantage of some generous @entity3 defending – tackling was non-existent at this early stage of the campaign – to slot in from 12 yards			2
