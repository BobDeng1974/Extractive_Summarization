by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 is painfully aware of the disaster that was his first year in @entity6 football			1
he does not try to hide from it and promises to put in the work required over the next few months to salvage his reputation as one of the brightest young talents in world football			1
the early signs are promising			1
already , in the opening two games , @entity16 ’s £ 30million record signing has shown glimpses of his quality and a tantalising hint that this campaign may be altogether different , under the influence of @entity25			1
‘ he has helped me a lot of times			1
but , really , it depends on me			2
it is down to me : how i train , what i do in training and in matches			2
then i think he will put me on the pitch			2
i will play wherever he puts me			2
if i am on the pitch , i will do my best			2
‘ it is a challenge for me because last season did not go as i had hoped : the injuries , maybe because i was not 100 per cent			1
these are things you have to overcome and change yourself			2
you always have to improve			2
i do n’t know how far i can go but i will try my hardest to make my team win			2
i want to train to the maximum and continue to improve as a footballer			2
‘ i am still young			0
i can improve a lot but it depends on me			0
this season i want to help my team and my team - mates to reach our aims			1
my aim is always to give to the team all that i can and to be 100 per cent focused			0
’ strike : @entity3 has a shot on goal during @entity16 's 2 - 1 @entity67 win over @entity30 @entity3 started only three games in the @entity70 last season after his transfer from @entity72 , where he scored 15 @entity74 goals in the previous year			1
in all competitions for @entity16 , he started 10 times and scored once , a goal against @entity78 of @entity79 in the @entity67			1
he arrived less than fully fit , unfairly touted as the man to help @entity16 fans recover from the loss of @entity83 but suffered back problems and related muscular injuries and his poor form made it hard to settle in @entity6			0
there were negotiations with @entity91 clubs in january over a swift return to @entity74 but the fee was a problem and @entity16 would not agree to a loan			1
his season effectively ended in december , when @entity97 cut him from his plans so he could sort out his problems			1
it cost him a place in the @entity103 squad but allowed time to spend with his family in his native @entity31 and return with a fresh mind and strong body			1
‘ it was great , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i now feel 100 per cent , without any injuries			0
i hope to continue like this			0
when i was injured , i was not good , i was not happy			0
i am happy to be playing football again and helping the team to win			0
’ control : @entity3 ( left ) on the ball during @entity16 ' 1 - 0 win over @entity115 on the opening day of the season during his time away , @entity97 was replaced by @entity25 , his third @entity16 boss in 12 months and a fellow countryman who has faith in the 22 - year - old to show his true value in his second @entity70 season			1
@entity3 started brightly in last weekend ’s win at @entity115 , although he suffered when they went to 10 men after @entity128 ’s red card , and he was the hero in @entity129 on thursday , helping to turn a 1 - 0 deficit into a 2 - 1 win after coming on for the last 18 minutes			1
‘ i am happy , it went well , ’ he said , speaking in @entity91 because his @entity6 is ‘ not quite there ’			0
backing : @entity16 head coach @entity25 has shown faith in 22 - year - old @entity3 he added : ‘ to come on and help change the match was great			1
it was a really difficult match because of the heat			0
@entity139 , it was super-hot			0
we are not used to it			0
the most important thing is that we came back and won the game and returned home as winners			0
’ @entity16 left back @entity146 , who played in thursday ’s win , thinks he has detected a change in @entity3 since his disastrous first season			1
‘ we were allowed a night out in @entity150 ( in pre-season ) and we all saw a different side to him , ’ he said			0
‘ he really came out of his shell and was having a laugh and a joke with everybody			0
i was warming up with him last night and you could tell he was raring to get on the pitch			0
‘ he did well to assist @entity161 ( @entity26 ) for the first goal and was involved in the second			0
