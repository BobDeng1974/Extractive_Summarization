@entity0 completed a shock loan move for midfielder @entity2 , a player they first started watching in 2005			1
the move , which was first revealed by @entity5 on friday morning , has been in the pipeline for many years as @entity7 has monitored the @entity9 ’s progress following his move to @entity11 in 2006			2
@entity2 jetted in from @entity13 ’s warm weather training base in @entity14 to complete a medical on friday			1
i am so pleased to come here to learn as much as possible			0
' i ’m here to do my best for @entity0 and to help out the team , so we can achieve good results for the last part of the season			2
' @entity2 will arrive on these shores with something of a muddled @entity56 name is familiar , it has been for the best part of a decade			2
only now , however , will we be able to pass judgement on the left - footed playmaker with a fancy for free - kicks who , to the consternation of many @entity0 fans , turns 32 later this year			1
for despite his lingering presence in our psyche , @entity2 remains something of a mystery			0
late bid : @entity7 's move for the @entity73 midfielder came out of the blue twice he has lined up for @entity18 against @entity75 at major tournaments , first during the 2 - 2 draw in @entity78 at @entity79 and then again at @entity80 as the @entity75 emerged 3 - 2 victors in @entity82			1
he was also part of the @entity18 side – inspired by four - goal @entity85 – who enjoyed a 4 - 2 friendly - match triumph over @entity75 in november 2012 and has appeared 108 times for his country.during six years at @entity11 he regularly locked horns with @entity91 clubs in @entity93 competition and , just last season with @entity13 , he was sent off during the closing stages of a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity97			1
hammer time : @entity2 possesses is famed for possessing a sweet left foot back in october while playing for @entity18 against @entity100 , this photograph of the midfielder with young mascot @entity104 went viral			1
it shows @entity2 helping the young fan , who has @entity108 syndrome , before the game			0
@entity104 ’s father wrote a letter to @entity112 saying : ‘ i am writing to you because i ’m not quite sure if you understand how much of a difference you ’ve made to us			0
‘ because of your actions my son was able to experience exactly the same feelings as everyone else : pride , a sense of being special			0
’ then there is his association – unfortunate or otherwise – with the @entity124 , the computer game which forecast big things for @entity2 during his formative years with @entity127 if in his homeland			0
no team was complete without the bargain buy from @entity131 who would go on to superstardom in this alternative universe			0
so when @entity2 did leave @entity18 in the direction of @entity38 aged just 21 , it was seen as the natural progression on a journey destined for one of @entity141 ’s top clubs			1
after two - and - a - half years with @entity33 and on the back of his four appearances at the @entity144 in @entity100 , champions @entity11 moved for the midfielder			0
there he would spend six seasons as a virtual ever - present , scoring 22 goals from 269 appearances and collecting two @entity37 winners ’ medals and two @entity38 trophies along the way			0
never , though , did he scale the heights once expected and , when @entity11 president @entity155 admitted he was willing to let the player go , @entity13 came in with a £ 3million bid in the summer of 2012			2
@entity2 joined @entity158 in the @entity160 capital but , like the @entity161 , never truly @entity162 brought closure on his unhappy stay when he signed for @entity165 earlier this month and the pair will be reunited when @entity0 travel to @entity168 in april			1
during his 18 months with @entity13 , @entity2 made just 28 starts and @entity7 ’s decision to invest in the @entity9 has been met with surprise , especially when his initial target was 20 - year - old @entity27 of @entity173			1
either way , at least his arrival will finally give @entity177 fans the chance to determine whether @entity2 is indeed midfield magician or simply a myth .			0

@entity0 sign 31 - year - old @entity13 midfielder @entity2 on loan
@entity2 has played 108 times for @entity18 but never quite live up to hype
