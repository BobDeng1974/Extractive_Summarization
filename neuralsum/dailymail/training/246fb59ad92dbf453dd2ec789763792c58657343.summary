by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:05 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 15:29 est , 30 november 2012 here 's a fascinating glimpse inside the shipping container homes set to be used as temporary accommodation for homeless people			1
a housing trust in @entity7 wants to use the 36 adapted containers as a stop - gap for people without a permanent home			1
it is the latest plan aimed at tackling @entity7 and @entity14 's ' desperate ' housing crisis			2
the structures were designed for a social housing project in @entity19 two years ago but the scheme had to be abandoned after hitting funding difficulties			0
it is hoped they will instead be used as temporary homes in @entity7 and @entity14 from late spring next year until a permanent roof can be found			1
the @entity21 and developer @entity43 are to submit a planning application to the local city council for a central site featuring the modified containers with allotments on the roofs			1
@entity51 , chief executive of @entity21 , said ' imaginative solutions ' were needed to deal with the ' desperate ' housing situation in the city			1
concern : @entity7 and @entity14 authorities recognise homelessness is a serious problem in the city			0
some 43 rough sleepers were counted there this month ( file picture ) shipping - container homes have been used elsewhere , including in @entity64 , and are seen as a significantly cheaper housing option than bricks and mortar			1
the plans in @entity7 follow a warning from leading housing bodies this month that homelessness and overcrowding are getting worse amid @entity74 ’s housing shortage			0
high property prices averaging around £ 302,000 , steep private rents and low average wages in the seaside city have contributed to high levels of homelessness the problems come against a background of rising private sector rents and as more people are claiming housing benefit nationwide , a report by @entity81 , the @entity82 and the @entity83 said			2
mr @entity51 said : ' i have to admit that when it was first suggested to me that shipping containers be used for housing i was a bit sceptical			2
' however , having seen what can be achieved , i was quickly won over			0
the @entity96 and shower unit is exactly the same as my daughter had in her student accommodation and she much preferred it to having to share bathrooms and toilets with other students			0
who would n’t ? ' what really excites me about this opportunity is that land that might otherwise lie idle for five years will be brought back into life and used to provide much - needed temporary accommodation for 36 men and women in @entity7 and @entity14			0
' much - needed : @entity112 say the container homes are desperately needed to help solve the city 's housing crisis production : @entity117 has these shipping container homes manufactured in @entity119 before they are installed around @entity120 when the site comes to be redeveloped , the containers can be transferred to other locations			1
mr @entity51 added : ' this appears to me to be very attractive from a sustainability perspective			0
' comfortable : the shipping container homes will be a stop - gap for people without accommodation in @entity7 exciting : @entity21 says it needs ' imaginative ' solutions to help solve the city 's housing crisis shelter chief executive @entity134 said the government ' simply is n’t delivering the new homes we need '			1
and @entity138 , chief executive of the @entity82 , said there had been ' “ words and policy ' but ' we ’ve not had delivery '			0
in @entity7 and @entity14 , the authorities recognise homelessness as a significant problem , with 43 people found sleeping rough during an annual headcount this month , up six from the previous year			2
mr @entity51 highlighted the case of one man who was living in his car and holding down a job			0
shortage : the containers are manufactured in @entity119 using old shipping containers before being delivered to @entity120 problem : average property prices of more than £ 300,000 and low wages have contributed to high levels of homelessness in @entity7 innovative : the 36 containers purchased by @entity21 which had been earmarked for a social housing project in @entity19 two years ago but funding fell through he said he would not want to see the shipping containers used as a long - term housing option here , but there are examples in mainland @entity120			1
' the most notable project is in @entity171 , @entity19 , a development by @entity173 , of 1,000 containers using exactly the same internal design layout as the ones we are proposing to use			2
it was completed in 2006 and is still in use today , ' he said			0
@entity43 director @entity179 told local newspaper @entity180 : ' we ’re not intending to dress them up and pretend they ’re not containers			2
' i think it could be an exciting way of addressing , quickly , what ’s a massive problem			0
' innovation : shipping containers have been used as homes in the @entity74 before such as this @entity191 in @entity64 unusual : 36 shipping containers , similar to these pictured , have already been converted into studio flats complete with bathrooms and kitchens			1

@entity21 wants to use converted containers to help people while they search for permanent home
each container comes with bathroom , kitchen and plasterboarded wall
shipping container homes have already proven a success in @entity27
