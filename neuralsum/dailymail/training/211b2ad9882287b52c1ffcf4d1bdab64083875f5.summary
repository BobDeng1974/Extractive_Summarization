after a hollow winter of taking the positives from defeat , it would be churlish not to celebrate saturday ’s victory over @entity5			1
it was built up as a must - win game , and @entity8 won			1
on a basic level they can do no more			0
yet the reflections of @entity5 coach @entity12 in the aftermath contained the tiniest note of warning			1
‘ we ’ve got to be able to deal with scrums , to deal with bombs , those high balls and the mauling , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m not worried			0
we ’ve got something we are going to be adding on down the line that will do that			0
there are clear areas we ’ve got to sort out but if we do it we ’ll be all right			0
’ @entity8 players jump for joy as their scrum crashes over the line to allow @entity31 to score his second try @entity31 gives out a scream after his first try - but @entity8 's game was very forward - dominated @entity5 head coach @entity12 says his side will not repeat the same mistakes next year @entity8 's scrum was dominant and @entity5 simply did not know how to deal with it on saturday maybe he was whistling to keep his spirits up			1
the dominance of @entity8 ’s forwards was such that it is hard to imagine @entity5 finding players of equivalent impact and stature in the next 12 months			2
with the nations due to face each other in @entity49 it was important @entity8 held the psychological advantage of maintaining supremacy over @entity5 at @entity52 - as they have done on three of the last four meetings - and they did			1
yet what if @entity12 does work his miracle ? there is no doubt @entity8 were playing @entity5 at their least prepared and familiar under him			1
if he is the coach his track record suggests , they will improve			0
@entity8 players celebrate @entity31 's second try - but they must adapt to a more expansive game @entity63 ( second right ) celebrates with coaches ( from left ) @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 after @entity8 's win - but they must know that the side needs to be more expansive to win a @entity49 and this was a victory earned in one facet of the game			1
it is an important aspect , and can drive a team to victory against the toughest opponents , but if @entity5 discover a way to match @entity8 ’s scrum and maul - the vague add - on that @entity12 hopes will bring change - what then ? so take the positives by all means - they were deserved - but let ’s not get carried away			1
@entity8 were the only nation of note to lose to @entity88 this winter and @entity5 are the southern hemisphere ’s work in progress			2
they have players missing - as have @entity8 - @entity12 has been in the job one month and the team were at the end of a spiteful run of 15 tests in 25 weeks			1
this is their worst winter in nine years and they have dropped to fifth in the world rankings , their poorest position since 2008			0
@entity100 ( right ) was brilliant and was bloodied and led off the @entity102 pitch by physio @entity103 ( left ) @entity31 was excellent for @entity8 and epitomised their decision to try and bludgeon @entity5 up front having been criticised for losing to @entity107 and @entity88 , it would be harsh to deny @entity8 their due , but this was a win achieved in a very specific way			1
@entity5 ’s running rugby was superior			2
some better decision - making or tighter passing near the try line and it could have been very different			0
@entity8 ’s performance was of the bloody , battered , fight - to - a - standstill variety			1
@entity118 , along with @entity31 the man of the match , made 12 tackles in the first hour - a remarkable number for a second row			0
in total , @entity8 delivered 158 tackles to @entity5 ’s 48 and if it did n’t feel like the @entity125 that was because @entity8 ’s forwards were so dominant the home team were behind for only three of 80 minutes and led for 68			1
@entity8 head coach @entity63 ( right ) congratulates @entity118 after a magnificent performance @entity129 ( left ) of @entity5 attempts to evade @entity130 - @entity8 made a huge 158 tackles on saturday sometimes all that matters , short - term , is victory and this was one of those days			1
@entity63 , the coach , pointed out that of @entity8 ’s 26 tries in 2014 , 21 had been scored by the backs , but the game told its own story			1
this was a nuts - and - bolts triumph			0
@entity8 had identified @entity5 ’s weakness in @entity145 last week - it was hardly the best - kept secret - and had ruthlessly exploited it			1
‘ if you can go through the middle , why do you need to go wide ? ’ @entity63 asked , and he is right			2
@entity8 powered through the heart of @entity5 ’s defence and there is every likelihood the same tactic will work on october 3 next year			2
its wider worth remains to be seen			0
the @entity8 scrum was dominant on saturday and epitomised the formidable @entity157 pack @entity158 ( right ) tries to offload the ball to @entity129 ( left ) as he is tackled by @entity8 players to win the tournament - and that has to be @entity8 ’s aim as hosts - is likely to require more and even floundering @entity5 had the better backs on saturday , as usual			1
certainly , @entity8 have no equivalent of @entity129			2
yet after being humbled by @entity88 , @entity167 went back to basics at the @entity49 in 2007 and @entity8 became unlikely finalists			2
it is perhaps no coincidence , then , that at the end of the game the most animated of @entity8 ’s coaches was @entity67 , marshal of the forwards			2
if @entity8 have been taking positives that many neutrals had barely glimpsed through the winter , the one consistent quality has been @entity67 ’s group			0
unfortunately @entity8 's back are not expansive enough and they do not have a quality star like @entity129 ( left ) @entity183 and @entity8 blindside @entity184 feeds @entity186 after a clean take at lineout time the line - out has been consistent , the scrum solid and there will be those who argue that @entity8 should continue playing to these strengths and damn the critics			2
right now , it would be foolish to pretend @entity8 ’s backs are a match for the very best : not on the showing this autumn			0
so to @entity201 , for the opening @entity200 game on friday , february 6			0
to say it will be a lively encounter rather underplays the mood and significance			0
wales are also @entity49 group opponents but few are calling this a must - win game - maybe because it is thought unlikely that @entity8 will deliver on the demand			1
and that puts saturday ’s game into the sharpest perspective			0
it was a necessary step , an important step , but with limitations			0
not least because what @entity8 are best at , @entity205 are , too ; plus several others			0
@entity8 's forward got through a huge amount of work against @entity5 at @entity102 on saturday wales are up first in the @entity200 for @entity8 and they 'll be formidable opponents after beating @entity88			1

@entity8 beat @entity5 through a brute , fight - to - a - standstill performance
they targeted @entity5 's weakness and exploited it brilliantly
@entity5 coach @entity12 *insists* they will learn from the defeat
@entity63 's men need more than a dominant pack to lift @entity49
saturday 's win was a necessary step forward but it had its limitations
