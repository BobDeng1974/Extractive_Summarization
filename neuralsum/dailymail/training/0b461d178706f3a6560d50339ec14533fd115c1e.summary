by @entity0 published : 01:08 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 12:50 est , 7 march 2014 he bobbled the spelling , but president @entity4 had nothing but @entity7 - @entity6 for the ' women of soul ' who shook and rattled the rafters of the @entity11 on thursday night			1
' what a lineup ! ' @entity4 declared at the outset of a concert that featured a generations - spanning array of soul singers that stretched from musical legends @entity18 and @entity20 to 20 - year - old @entity21			1
@entity4 paid tribute to @entity23 for turning her signature song @entity24 into ' a rallying cry for african - americans , women and then everyone who felt marginalized			1
it was a mutual admiration society of sorts as @entity20 thanked the @entity56 for their tenure in the @entity11 , declaring , ' baby , you got swag ! ' every woman : singer @entity63 performed during the ' i 'm every woman : @entity65 ' in the @entity66 @entity21 , the youngster in the group , seemed in awe of her fellow performers and the august audience			1
her lead - in : ' what 's up ? how are you ? good to see you			1
thank you for having me			0
' the emotional high point came when @entity77 , 71 , sauntered in , gave a shimmy and declared ' let 's have a party			1
' then she went right into @entity82 ( @entity83 )			0
she was back later to close down the show with what @entity4 called ' one more treat , ' - a slow , soulful rendition of ' @entity88 ' that turned rowdy at the end			1
@entity91 : singer @entity92 - the winner of season 5 of @entity91 - attended the event first lady : first lady @entity96 addressed the group during the @entity98 at the @entity11 but first , all the other ladies - including @entity38 , @entity63 , @entity100 and @entity92 - collaborated on a rollicking delivery of @entity102			1
the concert was livestreamed at @entity104 / live and will be broadcast as in performance at the @entity11 : women of @entity107 on april 7 on @entity108			1
at a morning arts workshop for high school and college students , first lady @entity96 called soul the kind of music that makes you move , no matter who you are or where you come from			2
' @entity20 , @entity38 and @entity63 had plenty of stories and advice to share with the students , then got them whooping , hooting and swaying with a trio of songs in the intimate venue of the @entity66			2
mrs. @entity96 quoted @entity20 as once saying that she had succeeded because she ' took chances and sang my butt off			2
' the first lady tried her own riff on that advice - then admitted she may have taken it a little too far			0
' find your own voice and be proud of it , ' she said			0
' and then , sing your butt off			0
or work your butt off			0
or whatever you do , do it until your butt comes off			0
' then she added : ' ok , that quote is going to be kind of funny in the papers			0
my communications people are like , " what ? " but you guys all know what i meant - be good at what you do			0
' the concert was scheduled as part of @entity151			0
said the president : ' as someone who always shares this house with brilliant , creative , talented , somewhat stubborn women , i think @entity151 is the perfect time to honor a few more : the women of soul			2

the event , titled ' @entity160 ' paid tribute to @entity107 legends like @entity20 and @entity18
the president *accidentally* *misspelled* ' respect ' while trying to *recite* @entity77 's classic hit @entity7 - @entity6
@entity4 called @entity77 's song ' a rallying cry for african - americans , women and then everyone who felt marginalized . '
