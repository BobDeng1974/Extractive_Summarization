one has straight ginger hair , a fair complexion and deep blue eyes			1
the other has masses of curls , far darker skin and her eyes are a sparkling brown			1
with such opposing looks it ’s hard to believe this striking pair are sisters			0
but they are much more than that – they are twins			2
the girls were born with radically different colouring thanks to a quirk of their mixed - race parentage			0
the girls were born in january 1997			0
their mother was astonished when she first saw the twins , as nothing on the scans had prepared her for their different skin tones			1
fair - haired @entity20 , who lives with her family in @entity22 , said : ‘ it was such a shock for her because things like skin colour do n’t show up on scans before birth			1
' so she had no idea that we were so different			0
when the midwife handed us both to her she was just speechless			0
’ their mother , who is 47 and a warehouse worker , and their 53 - year - old father , who works as a scaffolder , split up after the twins were born			1
family line : the twins ' mother @entity24 is half @entity25 and their father @entity26 is white , and their siblings @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 all have darker skin than @entity20 and lighter than @entity21 two of a kind : the twins , who live in @entity22 , were born in january 1997 @entity63 studies law at @entity65 , while ' shy ' @entity20 studies art and design at @entity68 all together : @entity21 and @entity20 with their mother @entity24 and siblings @entity57 , 23 , @entity58 , 22 , and @entity59 , 21 the 18 - year - olds have three older siblings , @entity57 , 23 , @entity58 , 22 , and @entity59 , 21			1
@entity20 said : ‘ our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween @entity21 and i. we are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween			1
non-identical twins come from separate eggs , so inherit different genes			1
the girls ’ half - @entity25 mother carries genes for both white and black skin			1
by chance , @entity20 will have inherited genes for white skin and @entity21 will have genes that code for black skin			1
people with @entity94 heritage often have some @entity96 dna , dating back in many cases to the slave trade			0
this increases the chance of them passing on a gene for white skin to at least one twin			2
‘ but my grandmother has a very fair @entity107 rose complexion , just like mine			2
’ she added : ‘ no one ever believes we are twins			2
even when we dress alike , we still do n’t look like sisters , let alone twins			0
friends have even made us produce our birth certificates to prove it			0
’ certainly at school there were no problems mistaking the twins for one another – and no way of playing tricks to confuse their classmates			0
@entity20 said : ‘ we were in the same class , but no one had a problem telling us apart			2
@entity127 are known for swapping identities			0
but there was no way @entity21 and i could ever do anything like that			2
‘ most twins look like two peas in a pod – but we could n’t look more different if we tried			0
we do n’t look like we have the same parents , let alone having been born at the same time			0
’ the twins ’ interests are as different as their looks			0
@entity20 studies art and design at @entity68 whilst @entity21 studies law at @entity65			1
@entity20 explained : ‘ @entity21 was outgoing whilst i was the shy one			1
but @entity21 loves telling people at college that she has a white twin – and i ’m very proud of having a black twin			2

@entity20 has fair skin and ginger hair , while @entity21 is darker with curls
