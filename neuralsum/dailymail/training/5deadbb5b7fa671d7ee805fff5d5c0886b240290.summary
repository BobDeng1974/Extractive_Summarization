yesterday the 26 - year - old was handed @entity7 at a ceremony in @entity9			0
the honour is named for renowned @entity12 journalist @entity11 , who presented the first award in 1984			2
giving such a prestigious accolade to mr @entity0 has raised eyebrows , not least with the man himself			2
he tweeted : ' maybe i can earn a @entity11 award by investigating how long it 'll take me to actually live up to a @entity11 award			1
' before the event , organisers reach @entity23 banned reporters from asking ' off - topic ' questions - to ensure that @entity0 will not have to comment on the controversy surrounding whether his father was @entity28 or @entity29			1
the organisation even threatened to throw out anyone who broke the rule			0
' the theme of the evening is global education and service , ' a memo to the press read , reports @entity38			0
' all press are required to stay strictly on message			0
any press who ask guests or mr. @entity0 about off - message topics will be immediately escorted out of the event			0
' @entity46 denied that the diktat came from @entity0 's team			1
a statement to the @entity50 read : ' @entity0 and his team did not request any restrictions on reporters ' questions			0
' @entity0 later tweeted : ' i ’d never demand anyone not ask me anything , obviously			0
( does n’t mean i have to answer though			0
) ' @entity0 tweeted a tongue in cheek response to receiving the accolade things looked more positive in february for @entity0 when he won a coveted journalism award despite little prior experience , @entity46 had high hopes that @entity0 will help them attract millennial viewers , something which has n't happened so far earlier this month @entity28 wrote that @entity0 , his son , could have been fathered by @entity29 and claimed that mother @entity67 may have been lying about it for decades			1
the @entity70 director said @entity0 , his only biological child with @entity67 , ‘ looks a lot like @entity29 ’ thanks to his blue eyes and similar facial features			1
@entity28 said that if it were true then @entity0 would have kept a dark secret during their bitter custody battle 21 years ago to make him pay child support			2
@entity28 ’s claims were in response to an article in @entity84 magazine in which @entity0 said that @entity29 was ‘ possibly ’ @entity0 ’s father			1
writing in the @entity86 , he also for the first time publicly addressed allegations he abused his adopted daughter @entity89 and called them ‘ ludicrous ’			0
@entity28 has questioned whether @entity0 is his biological son			2
there is speculation that @entity29 is his real father			1

@entity46 anchor given prestigious journalism award despite *inexperience*
he poked *fun* at himself , admitting he has yet to ' live up to ' the award
reporters were forbidden from asking about his *disputed* *parentage*
there is speculation @entity29 , not @entity28 , is his father
