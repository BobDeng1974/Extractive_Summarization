defense secretary @entity0 defended the daring july 4 mission to rescue @entity2 and claimed it was ' flawless ' , even though the special forces mission assaulted the wrong camp and failed to bring him home			1
speaking at the @entity7 on thursday , @entity6 claimed the mission personally authorized by the president went exactly according to plan and categorically denied the assault was a failure of intelligence			1
speaking alongside @entity13 , the chairman of the @entity14 , the defense secretary said , ' the fact is you all know intelligence does n’t come wrapped in a package with a bow			0
' it is a mosaic of many pictures of many factors			0
' the enemy always has a say in everything			0
the fact is , you have to work that reality in to any decision you make , but the underlying objective was to do everything we could as the president has said to rescue these hostages , knowing their lives were in danger , clearly in danger			0
' scroll down for @entity38 flawless : @entity41 secretary of defense @entity0 ( @entity42 ) speaks next to @entity43 general @entity13 during a press briefing at the @entity7 in @entity45 on thursday mission : @entity41 secretary of defense @entity0 ( @entity42 ) and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general @entity13 hold a press briefing at the @entity7 in @entity45 on thursday mission : six weeks before a $ 132 ransom was sent to the family of @entity2 , a special forces raid on an @entity54 base named camp @entity54 was launched six weeks after the bungled strike to rescue @entity2 , 40 , his captors sent his family and the @entity41 government a $ 132 million ransom demand			1
this was ignored and one week later the revolting video of his beheading was released and justified by @entity54 as retaliation for @entity41 air strikes against them in @entity68			1
now , the failure to free @entity2 or negotiate his release has backed the president into a corner as he deals with the threat to kill the second hostage paraded in front of the camera on tuesday , @entity77			2
indeed , at the end of tuesday 's grisly video , @entity2 's executioner , who is widely believed to be @entity82 , delivers an ominous threat towards the @entity84			2
' the life of this @entity41 citizen , @entity86 , depends on your next decision , ' up until very recently , @entity54 had been trying to extort millions from the @entity41 in exchange for @entity2 , no doubt encouraged by the lucrative trade in hostages between the terror group and @entity94 countries willing to pay			1
france $ 58.1m @entity95 and oman $ 20.4m switzerland $ 12.4m @entity96 $ 11m austria $ 3.2m the @entity97 estimates that the @entity98 and @entity99 has siphoned off as much as $ 125 million from compliant @entity94 governments such as @entity101 and @entity102 , while the @entity41 and @entity82 steadfast refuse			1
four @entity101 and three @entity96 hostages were released in 2014 from @entity99 affiliates after the two countries handed over millions reported the @entity97			2
however , now that @entity41 citizens are dying , and in such public and barbaric fashion , the @entity41 is having to work out how it will free @entity77 and at least two other hostages kept in custody			0
the policy of non-negotiation , which the @entity41 shares with @entity82 , now puts it increasingly at odds with many of it @entity115 partners			0
in an opinion piece for @entity117 , @entity118 , who works for the news agency argues that by launching a mission and not paying the ransom contributed to @entity2 's death			1
' the payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows			0
it must be publicly debated , ' wrote mr. @entity118 , who escaped from the @entity130 himself by climbing out of a window			0
' @entity41 and @entity94 policy makers should be forced to answer for their actions			2
' according to the @entity97 , @entity54 has sent a list of demands to the @entity41 for prisoner swaps , including @entity137 , an @entity138 trained neuroscientist from @entity140 currently incarcerated in @entity141			2
in the aftermath of @entity2 's death , many have asked whether swapping prisoners could be an effective manner of keeping up the policy of non-negotiation			2
frightening : @entity149 tenses as his executioner addresses the camera who says this act of revenge is in responce to @entity41 airstrikes on @entity68 raid on @entity157 : the special forces team flew in from @entity159 and attacked the northern @entity161 base to free @entity2 however , the offer to spare @entity2 's life in exchange for money and the flat out refusal to negotiate has left the @entity84 sensitive to growing criticism of its policy in dealing with @entity41 hostages abroad , especially the @entity171			1
so sensitive in fact that the @entity84 confirmed on wednesday that they had launched a mission to save @entity2 , six weeks ago , but unfortunately it failed			1
over the weekend of july 4 , troops from ' nearly ever @entity41 military service ' tried and failed to rescue @entity2 from an @entity54 terror base in @entity161 named @entity157 , according to new details on the attempt			1
an operative working inside the @entity98 said that the fruitless raid was carried out by two dozen soldiers , who launched from an airbase in @entity159 and touched down on @entity161 soil to make their assault on the @entity54 stronghold , named after the dead @entity99 chief			1
authorized mission : @entity86 delivered a statement from @entity189 , @entity190 , during his vacation on wednesday			2
hours later it was revealed he authorized a mission in july to save @entity2			1
it failed the mission , the first known incursion by @entity41 troops into @entity161 since the civil war erupted in 2012 was personally authorized by president @entity86 and according to @entity200 , the unsuccessful assault left five militants dead and countless others wounded			1
it was over @entity204 weekend that @entity209 commandos , backed - up by helicopters , fixed - wing aircraft and surveillance craft began their assault from southern @entity159 in the hope of freeing the kidnapped @entity41 citizen and his fellow hostages			1
the battle - hardened soldiers touched down in the @entity216 area of @entity218 province and prepared to storm the islamic state base named after the dead @entity99 leader and mastermind of the atrocities committed on 9/11			0
the ground team failed to find any trace of @entity2 or other hostages and was attacked by @entity54 forces as they attempted to extract themselves from @entity161			1
watch video here dignified : @entity229 and @entity230 talked to reporters after the death of their son , photojournalist @entity2 , at the hands of @entity54 one @entity41 soldier was injured in the fierce gun battle that ensued , but @entity41 officials have so far declined to divulge how long troops spent searching or how long the battle between @entity41 forces and those of @entity54 lasted for			1
' the president authorized action at this time because it was the national security team ’s assessment that these hostages were in danger with each passing day , ' said @entity247 , an assistant national security adviser			0
' the @entity41 government had what we believed was sufficient intelligence			0
' confirmation of the failed attempt to rescue @entity2 came one day after the barbaric footage of his beheading was published online to the revulsion of the world			2
the mission to save the journalist and others was carried out in early july but was unsuccessful because the hostages - being held by a group of @entity82 jihadists known as ' @entity265 ' - could not be found			0
' this operation involved air and ground components and was focused on a particular captor network within @entity54 [ also known as @entity54 and @entity270 ] , ' the @entity84 said in a statement last night			0
' unfortunately , the mission was not successful because the hostages were not present at the targeted location			0
' no mercy : @entity277 president and ceo @entity278 revealed the @entity2 family had received a ' rage ' - filled email from @entity54 threatening to execute the journalist a week ago , and that the @entity84 had been aware of the threat it came as president @entity86 's conduct attracted growing criticism after he played golf immediately after he gave a speech condemning the murder of mr @entity2			1
four minutes after leaving the podium @entity86 teed - off and was seen laughing with friends and fist - bumping them during a five - hour round at @entity293 on @entity189 - his seventh 18 - holes in ten days			0
meanwhile his administration was briefing on its rescue attempts this summer and said it would not release more details on the raid , but sources told the @entity97 that the mission was carried out by two dozen special - ops members , who were dropped off in @entity161 in early july and were met with gunfire			1
' while on site , it became apparent the hostages were not there , ' one of the officials said			0
the sources would n't say where the raid was held , but pointed out that if it had happened in a heavily - populated area - it likely would have already made news			0
they also would n't comment on how many hostages were believed to be held captive at the location , or their names			0
during the fight the @entity54 forces suffered ' a good number of casualties ' while only one @entity41 was slightly wounded			2
the @entity41 team was then able to retreat back to their helicopters and escape			0
the administration kept the raid a secret until now in order to ' preserve future opportunities ' for another mission			0
details of the mission were revealed after president @entity86 spoke about the execution of @entity2 and promised new strikes on @entity54 .			1

@entity0 defended @entity209 mission to rescue @entity2 and said it was ' flawless '
ransom of $ 132 million demanded from @entity2 's family one week before he was beheaded
sent in ' *vitriolic* ' email six weeks after special forces mission to save him went to the wrong terror camp
president @entity86 personally authorized july 4 weekend raid
the assault was launched from @entity159 to @entity161 on @entity157
the @entity41 does not negotiate with terrorists nor pay ransoms
@entity54 and @entity99 has extorted $ 125 million from compliant @entity94 countries who pay
