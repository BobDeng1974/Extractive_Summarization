by @entity0 published : 19:55 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 19:55 est , 13 january 2014 families threw away mountains of good food over @entity5 amid complaints supermarkets continue to encourage people to buy too much			1
one in five people threw away or wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over @entity5 and @entity12 , according to a new study			1
tonnes of fresh vegetables and salad , mince pies and turkey were piled into bins after they went off before they could be eaten			2
a new study has found that one in five people wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over the festive period families blamed supermarket promotions for over-indulging on food purchases they could not eat			1
some 70 per cent said supermarkets urged them to increase their food purchasing over the festive season – with 45 per cent saying they did buy more			1
seventy - two per cent of shoppers said they were tempted by @entity32 ( @entity33 ) , while 70 per cent said they bought extra because of half - price deals			1
more than a third named discounts such as vouchers , money off single items and loyalty card offers as other routes to increased and often unnecessary buying			2
the study was commissioned by the @entity43 , and comes one year after it published a major study - @entity45 ; waste not , want not – estimating that between 30 to 50per cent of all food produced is never eaten			1
dr @entity48 , @entity49 , said : ‘ this latest survey shows that @entity52 shoppers still feel they are encouraged to buy too much food , despite significant progress on raising awareness of food waste in 2013 , and some retailer action to reduce over-purchasing			0
seventy - two per cent of respondents said they were tempted by @entity62 deals , while 70 per cent said they had bought extra because of the deals ‘ there are various reasons why around a third to a half of all food produced in the world never reaches a human stomach , and while it would be wrong to lay all of the blame for waste with the supermarkets - deals like @entity32 , “ half price ” offers and various other price discounting methods do exacerbate the problem			1
’ he said : ‘ it is certainly a concern that over a fifth of the people surveyed said they had thrown away more than 10per cent of the food they bought over the festive period			1
‘ this food could be used to help feed those in hunger today , and is also an unnecessary waste of the considerable land , water and energy resources that were used in the production , processing and distribution of this food - resources that could be used to meet other human needs			0
‘ if we are to have a sustainable future on a planet with over nine billion people on board it is important that everybody , from the government and retailers through to consumers at home , tries to reduce the amount of food that is wasted and thinks about the land , water and energy resources involved in bringing food to the plate			1
’ the survey of 2,023 people found that the older generation threw less food away			1
some 45per cent of over 65s said they did not waste or throw away any of the food , which compares to just a third of those aged 18 - 24			2
the @entity43 said the world produces about four billion metric tonnes of food per year , but between a third and a half of this is wasted through poor practices and inadequate infrastructure			2
the study , @entity131 ; waste not want not estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of all food produced is never eaten			1
file picture the group said it would be possible to feed the world ’s growing population without the need to increase production greatly , if more of the food that is produced was eaten rather than wasted			1
supermarkets have attempted to shift the blame for food waste from themselves to customers			0
a senior executive at @entity145 caused controversy in december by suggesting that fussy customers , who were unwilling to buy misshapen or blemished fresh produce , were to blame			0
@entity149 , food sourcing director at @entity145 , told a @entity151 inquiry , that customers will also select the freshest and best looking fruit and vegetables			0
he said : ‘ customers naturally select , they always pick the cream of crop first and the rest of it then gets left			0
‘ then the new deliveries come in and you have the new cream of the crop – the old , ugly misshapen produce goes to waste			0
‘ customers will always make the choice of the one that cosmetically looks better			0
that ’s a very difficult reality to us			0
’ in october , @entity145 revealed that it generated almost 30,000 tons of food waste in the first six months of the year			0
it found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin , including 68 per cent of bagged salads , half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes			2
much of the food was thrown away by customers but large amounts were lost because they have been on display for too long			0
the supermarket subsequently scrapped confusing ‘ display until ’ dates on fresh fruit and vegetables , and ended buy one get one free offers on salads			0
research by the @entity187 suggests families waste £ 60 a month by throwing the equivalent of almost a meal a day into the bin			0
it said a staggering £ 12.5billion worth of food is wasted annually .			2
