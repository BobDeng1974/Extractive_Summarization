by @entity0 published : 15:19 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 15:32 est , 10 november 2013 people up in arms over a @entity4 high school named after the first @entity5 of the @entity6 are working to get the name changed			1
previous attempts to rename @entity9 , in @entity10 , were unsuccessful , but officials have begun looking into a name change after the father of a district student started a petition and has said he will not allow his daughter to attend the school			1
@entity21 ’s @entity20 petition has well over 100,000 signatures , but the @entity23 has said it will have no impact on the high school ’s name			2
the first @entity5 : @entity27 was head of the @entity6 from 1866 until 1869 mr @entity30 ’s daughter attend the district , the @entity28 told @entity32 he will not allow her to set foot inside a school named after a famously notorious racist			1
‘ it just would n’t happen , ’ mr @entity30 said			0
‘ i believe it ’s outrageous that this could even be questioned by anybody … that anybody could even come to the defense of this man			0
’ he ’s not alone , the more than 160,000 people who signed his online petition come from all over the country			1
‘ i am very encouraged that [ people ] chose to support this cause and i am humbled by that and excited for change , ’ he continued			1
sentiment clearly supports a change , but there is a catch			0
a @entity23 spokesperson told @entity32 the district will only listen to a name change request originating from within its boundaries – where mr @entity30 lives , and that the final decision will be made by school board members			1
honoring a racist : @entity62 was named after the former @entity6 leader , but residents want that to change a previous attempt to change the school ’s name have somehow failed			1
despite a 2007 @entity71 study that received an overwhelming number of responses in favour of changing the school ’s name , the school board voted against changing the school ’s name , according to @entity32			1
the vote had two african - americans in favor of changing the name , but five whites voted against the idea			0
the city of @entity84 , @entity85 , earlier this year voted to rename a park named after the mr @entity27 , who also was a general in the @entity87 during the @entity88			2
the @entity6 marched on the city , with a local leader claiming ' the @entity91 is basically trying to eradicate white people out of the history books across @entity94			2
' @entity95 , the college professor who headed up the 2007 effort , is spearheading this one as well			0
he believes this time the name will change			0
‘ we do n’t want 60 percent of the kids , black kids going to a school named for somebody who would ’ve killed them and enslaved them if he had the chance , ’ mr @entity95 told @entity32			2
over 90 per cent of respondents in just under 2,000 door to door surveys conducted by mr @entity95 ’s @entity107 have responded in favour of changing the school ’s name , @entity32 noted			0
the @entity6 : klan members wear ceremonial robes and carry @entity114 flags , in a nod to their past , when marching in protest a further 36 people showed up to last week ’s school board meeting advocating to change the name , according to @entity32			1
some did speak in favour of the name remaining , arguing for mr @entity27 ’s place in history			0
‘ @entity27 , the man , and his association with the @entity6 is history , ’ 1979 graduate @entity125 said , according to @entity32			2
‘ the @entity6 ’s function was much different in his time than it is now			0
’ ‘ i think you ’d be hard pressed to find any @entity134 gentleman from that era that did n’t have some association with the @entity6 , ’ she added			0
despite further arguing by ms @entity125 that the school has very little money for band and drama programs , the school board voted unanimously to move forward with the process			1
the drawn out plan involves gathering info from many groups , including current and former students , the @entity148 and many more			0
it is unlikely a vote will be held this year , a spokesperson told @entity32 .			2

@entity9 , in @entity10 , is named after the first @entity5 of the @entity6
over 160,000 people have signed an online petition
*thousands* in @entity10 support the change
a school board vote is likely to be held next year
