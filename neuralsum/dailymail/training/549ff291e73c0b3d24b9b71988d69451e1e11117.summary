' i was always careful to ensure he never came into contact with any food with nuts in			2
he never had @entity70 food and would not eat any sweets or confectionery which may contain nuts			2
' from an early age he was self - disciplining and made sure he did n’t eat those products			2

' they would stop the game so he could use his inhaler then start it up again			0
' her son , an avid @entity5 fan , was described as ' football crazy ' , naming his bearded dragon sir @entity85 after sir @entity85			0
the inquest heard the year seven pupil was ' cheeky and funny ' and ' full of life '			1
on october 19 last year @entity0 had scored the winning goal in a youth football match			1
when he arrived home after spending the day with friends , his mother suggested the family order an @entity96 takeaway			1

' the gentleman i spoke to on the phone spoke perfect @entity117 , ' she told the inquest			1
' we discussed that my meal could n’t contain nuts			1
he assured me my meal would n’t contain nuts			1
@entity0 and i do not eat korma or tikka because it has nuts			1
' @entity0 did n’t have a lot to eat - possibly only a couple of mouthfuls because it tasted funny			1
within seconds i felt as though i could n’t breathe			2
i took a few breaths from my inhaler and went to the front door for some fresh air			0
' i came back and sat down next to @entity0 and he tapped me on the leg and said " i ca n’t breathe "			1
' i got his inhaler and he took ten breaths from it			0
the inhaler had no effect and i could tell it was n’t going well so i straight away rang 999			2
' i was comforting @entity0 and he slumped down and i was on the phone to the ambulance who were telling me what to do			1
i had already started doing cpr			2
' when paramedics arrived at the family 's @entity15 home , his condition was so serious there was no time to put him on a stretcher			1
a paramedic carried the 12 - year - old to the ambulance , and continued to try and revive him for 20 minutes en route to the @entity153			2
shortly after arriving at the hospital doctors pronounced @entity0 dead			1
tests confirmed he had suffered from a severe peanut allergy			1
he had only avoided the food on the advice of his mother , rather than seeking a professional opinion and testing			2
@entity162 , the owner of the @entity163 , said he was satisfied serving a balti to someone with an allergy at the time - but has since realised the potentially devastating effects of cross-contamination			2
football fan : the 12 - year - old @entity5 fan scored the winning goal in his youth match on the day he died			1
@entity0 's family described him as ' cheeky and funny ' and ' full of life ' emergency : @entity0 's mother mrs @entity20 started cpr while waiting for an ambulance to arrive			1
paramedics took over , attempting to revive the 12 - year - old for 20 minutes en route to the @entity153 ( pictured ) where he was later pronounced dead he maintained that woks and spoons were always clean			1
he said : ' i would be ok with someone having a balti with allergies			1
i had been aware of the risk of cross contamination			0
' i know even the slightest thing can do something to another curry so we always make sure spoons and woks are clean			2
' not just for allergies but also for flavour			2
as far as i am concerned the same utensil should not be used in my premises if it will be used for another sauce			0
' we do use @entity203 ’s balti sauce			2
it says it may contain traces of nuts			1
on the new menu i have said that all dishes may contain nuts			2
i will recommend customers not to have a balti but i ca n’t say whether or whether it does n’t contain nuts			1
anaphylaxis is a severe , potentially life - threatening allergic reaction			2
also known as anaphylactic shock , the condition can develop very rapidly			0
breathing difficulties , feeling lightheaded or faint , changes to your skin including an itchy rash , and swelling body parts , particularly the face , are all signs a person is suffering a reaction			2
anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency			0
the @entity230 website advises that if you suspect you or somebody else is suffering an anaphylatic shock you should dial 999 immediately			0
many people suffering nut allergies carry an injection of adrenaline medication with them at all times			1
the injections , often carried in an @entity240 , should be administered into a person 's thigh muscle and held in place for 10 seconds			0
if the person suffering the allergic reaction falls unconscious medics advise they are put in the recovery position			0
if their breathing stops , cpr should be performed , the @entity230 website states			0
anaphylaxis is the result of a person 's body 's immune system overreacting to a harmless substance			0
the substances , for example nuts , are known as allergens			0
the condition usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen			0
the most common triggers are insect stings , nuts , other types of food including milk and seafood , and certain medications			0
those who suspect they maybe allergic to something should seek medical advice and tests to determine the allergen			0
' there is a risk			0
no matter how careful you are there is a risk			0
business owners need to know because we do n’t want this to happen again			0
' coroner @entity286 reiterated his warning , telling the inquest that all allergy sufferers must be aware of the dangers of eating at any takeaway restaurant , especially @entity293 , where it is wise to assume there are traces of nuts in all dishes			1
@entity298 , an environmental health officer from @entity299 , said an inspection of the premises found staff at the takeaway had a poor knowledge of ' cross contamination ' of foods and were using the same spoons to decant different sauces			1
the chef was unaware @entity203 ’s sauces had an advisory label for allergy sufferers			0
miss @entity298 said : ' we did n’t notice any actual peanuts being used			0
the @entity203 ’s paste was the only product being used which may contain traces of nuts			1
' apart from that there was almond powder and coconut flakes			0
the powder was being decanted into a drum which can lead to further contamination			0
' @entity326 can contain peanuts because they are cheaper			0
' we did some research into almond powder and there has been an adulteration with high percentages of peanut powder being used to bulk it up because it is cheaper			0
' the almond powder contained at least 50 per cent peanut powder			0
we need to go back to the wholesaler to investigate further			0
' dr @entity339 of @entity153 said : ' there are more things in @entity96 food than nuts capable of causing allergies			1
i think in this very sad incident the allergy was too overwhelming and too sudden			0
' the medical cause of @entity0 ’s death was given as an acute asthma attack due to an anaphylactic reaction to food containing peanuts			1
dr @entity353 , an allergy expert at @entity354 added : ' if you are eating out in these restaurants or getting takeaways then the people providing the food need to understand you have an allergy but it is still a big risk			1
if due care is not taken then one would expect serious contamination			0
' reaching a conclusion of accidental death , @entity47 coroner mrs @entity286 said the public need to be aware of the risk that in food outlets where nuts are used there is a high likelihood of cross contamination			1
she added : ' even that small amount caused by cross contamination can be dangerous to a person with a nut allergy			0
' i do n’t think the message is sufficiently out there that not only do you need to avoid food with nuts in them but you need to be careful about eating food from premises where nuts are used with any food stuff			1
even a small amount from cross contamination can be fatal			0
' what we did n’t know until the evidence of today is the risk presented by cross contamination in premises where food is sold unsealed			0
that would include restaurants and takeaways and cafes			0
' a very small amount of allergen might be all that is required for a tragedy such as this			0
depending on the individual cross contamination might be enough to result in this sort of desperate , desperate tragedy			0
' i offer my sincere condolences			0
i am so glad he got to have that football game and scored the winning goal			0
' currently , around 10 people per year die from food - related anaphylactic shock and allergic reactions in the @entity415 .			2
