by @entity0 published : 19:00 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 5 march 2013 older people with diabetes are suffering needless life - changing complications , including amputations and blindness , because of discrimination in favour of younger patients , a new report has warned			1
half of the diabetics in the @entity14 are over the age of 60 , yet they are being denied the proper care and aggressive treatment which is routinely given to younger patients , experts say			1
this discrimination then leads to complications such as blindness and kidney failure - costing the @entity23 £ 9.8 billion a year - according to the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) report launched today			1
older diabetics are suffering needless life - changing complications , including amputations and blindness , because they are not getting the best treatment , experts warn yet within the next seven years , 60 per cent of diabetics will be over 60 and if nothing is done , more beds will be taken by elderly patients with the associated rising costs , the @entity22 report says			1
in fact , the crisis in health care threatens to bankrupt the already overstretched @entity23 , it says			1
earlier this week , shocking figures revealed that one in 20 @entity14 is suffering from diabetes as a result of soaring obesity rates			1
some 132,000 patients were found to have the condition in the last year , adding to the 2,912,000 existing sufferers in 2011			0
this brings the total to 3.04million – 4.6 per cent of the @entity14 population – compared with 2.2million six years ago			2
and a further 850,000 people are thought to have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes , according to analysis of official data by @entity54 charity and @entity55			0
the soaring rate of type 2 – which mostly affects middle - aged people – is being blamed on obesity			0
blindness is one of the most common consequences of diabetes if the condition is not managed properly nine out of ten people with diabetes have type 2 , which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar , which can damage the organs and lead to years of ill health			0
complications of diabetes include diabetic retinopathy - the leading cause of blindness in the @entity14 - nerve damage , kidney disease , heart disease and even the need for the amputation , as ulcers in the foot can become severely infected			1
in the last few years , retinopathy has increased by 118 per cent , stroke by 87 per cent , kidney failure by 56 per cent and cardiac failure by 43 per cent			0
and it is estimated that of more than 100 amputations carried out each week from diabetes complications , up to 80 per cent are preventable			2
professor @entity93 , director at @entity94 ( @entity22 ) said : ' it ’s a tragedy that so many elderly people suffer these complications when they could be so easily prevented if they were given the care and treatment that they need			2
' older patients with diabetes complications currently occupy 15 per cent of all hospital beds			0
professor @entity93 predicts that by 2030 , this figure will rocket to one in four hospital beds , costing taxpayers £ 465.25 million per year - the equivalent of 1.34 million diabetes bed days			2
he added : ' if nothing is done now to improve the care of older people with type 2 diabetes , the effect on patients and the @entity23 could be catastrophic - the impending diabetes time bomb could potentially bankrupt the already stretched service			1
' in order to ensure older people with type 2 diabetes receive better care , the institute has launched new guidelines in the form of user - friendly recommendations for doctors , nurses and care home managers who work with or care for older people with diabetes			0
the guidelines have been developed to address care gaps highlighted in previous studies			0
prof @entity93 said : ' in the past , some clinical guidelines have ignored the issues faced by older people with diabetes such as frailty , functional ability and increased dependency , focusing mainly on the needs of the young , and consequently older people have missed out on preventive treatments and suffered blindness and limb amputation as a result in some cases			0

half of the diabetics in the @entity14 are over 60 , yet are ' not getting proper care '
this leads to them suffering complications that cost the @entity23 £ 9.8bn a year
one in 20 @entity14 is now suffering from diabetes , which is linked to obesity
new report aims to *tackle* age discrimination associated with the disease
