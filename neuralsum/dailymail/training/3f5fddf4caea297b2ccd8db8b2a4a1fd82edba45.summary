by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 08:08 est , 9 march 2014 i was at @entity4 on saturday , @entity2 missed some chances because their strikers are useless , then @entity7 took control of the game , before @entity2 got a dodgy penalty and @entity11 got himself needlessly sent off			1
@entity7 were unlucky not to win			0
the @entity12 … is @entity11 really a @entity14 player ? what do you think ? he left a foot in high on @entity18 and he thoroughly deserved his red card			1
there was no need to do it – what was going through @entity11 ’ mind ? @entity11 was captain at his previous club @entity24 , but he showed no leadership on saturday , he let his @entity2 team - mates down			1
there are many who criticise the @entity14 for a lack of quality			1
@entity11 is their poster boy			1
he works hard , and that ’s about it			0
@entity11 ’ story is an example to many in that he was a bit wayward as a youngster , released by top flight clubs , and fought his way back			1
saturday ’s red card aside , he has become a true professional , and that should be admired			0
however , that alone should n’t be enough to sustain a top flight career			0
maybe i ’ve been missing that secret something that makes @entity11 special			1
too many ex-professionals and pundits are blandly kind about footballers			0
i just tell the truth as i see it			0
i think even some of those who feel they have to be nice about @entity11 , agree deep down with what i ’m saying			1
it ’s not rocket science … neither side is prolific and i was n’t expecting a goalfest			0
the goals that came were not down to great attacking play – @entity76 must have objected to @entity78 ’s @entity77 because he inexplicably stepped away from his man at a set - piece and @entity78 headed home			2
@entity2 ’s equaliser was a dodgy penalty			1
breakthrough : it took 56 minutes before @entity78 headed in for @entity7 to open the scoring against @entity2 at @entity4 delight : @entity78 runs away to celebrate with @entity89 after the goal spot on : @entity11 earned @entity2 a point by converting a 73rd - minute penalty @entity93 : @entity11 expressed delight at his equaliser but he was later sent off for a high challenge on @entity18 looking over their shoulder : both @entity2 and @entity7 are not entirely clear of the relegation dogfight there are different reasons why these two sides do n’t score enough goals : @entity2 ’s strikers are n’t good enough , @entity104 ’s best days are behind him			1
he sometimes struggles to work out whether to use his head or feet , taking so long to make a simple decision the chance is gone			0
let ’s just say he ’s long since stopped playing off instinct			0
@entity104 also missed a one - on - one early on which set the tone for his 90 minutes			1
is @entity11 the slowest player in the @entity14 ? he ’s way too slow to cause enough problems			1
@entity2 need pace and they need a finisher			1
actually they need new strikers in the summer , it really is that simple			0
lost instincts : @entity104 did n't have his most impressive display against @entity7 high boot : @entity11 was dismissed for a challenge of @entity123 during the closing stages of the match , but @entity7 were unable to grab a winner seeing red : referee @entity128 sends @entity11 for an early bath click here to read our match report from carrow road by @entity133 @entity7 have finishers in @entity135 and @entity136 – check their records at other clubs , they ’re prolific			1
but they do n’t get the service			0
in central midfield , @entity140 is their creative spark but he ’s not creative enough , not consistently game in game out			0
@entity146 and @entity147 were very wasteful with their delivery on the right , @entity145 is perhaps guilty of being too cautious on the left – i ’d love to see him marauding more down the flank and on the few occasions he has done that this season he ’s made a difference			0
the star man is @entity89 , he ’s fantastic			0
so good on the ball , his feet are quick and he can take on his man			0
his final delivery is n’t quite good enough , whether that ’s a cross or a shot			0
he ’s being played out wide but i reckon he ’d be a superstar in the hole			0
if @entity35 is brave enough to put him there , i think @entity7 could flourish			0
those strikers need to be given more clear - cut chances , the @entity7 need to be cleverer			2
@entity166 man : @entity89 was again impressive for @entity7 with his pace and ability to take on defenders the most ironic penalty of the season … go back through some games this season and you ’ll find @entity2 defenders regularly pulling and pushing , barging and holding opponents as they are trying to keep the ball out of @entity179 ’s net			1
rarely do they have penalties given against them			0
disbelief : @entity182 reacts after being adjudged to have fouled @entity183 , leading to @entity2 's equaliser yet here at @entity4 , @entity182 and @entity183 went for a ball together , both were equally physical , @entity183 ended up on the ground , the referee gave a penalty			1
i could n’t see it			0
how do @entity2 get away with persistent fouling when they ’re defending , and yet they benefited from a frankly ridiculous penalty gifted to them at @entity7			2
the most pointless loan move of the season … has to be @entity196 ’s @entity183 switching from @entity197 to @entity2			1
before the game the promising striker had played just 40 minutes of football for @entity2 since joining in january			1
at @entity7 he came on after 63 minutes ( he came on for @entity201 who i did n’t realise was playing ) , won a dubious penalty , and then was substituted 17 minutes later after @entity11 ’ red card			2
used sparingly : @entity183 , on loan from @entity197 , came on as a substitute , won a penalty that @entity11 ( right ) converted , and was then subbed off again when @entity209 got a red card that wo n’t please the @entity196 who was already expressing frustration at a lack of game time under @entity36 before january had drawn to a close			1
@entity183 scored 20 goals in 23 games for @entity218 two seasons ago			2
@entity2 lack a decent finisher			2
your work it out for yourselves			0
you ’d think @entity36 , a great striker in his day , would be able to join up the dots on that one			2
at least @entity227 ’ red card means @entity183 should get a chance			2
never forget your history … @entity7 devoted the matchday to one of their legends , @entity231			0
he was a bruising centre half who spent 33 years at @entity4 on and off the pitch			2
now aged 72 , @entity236 is suffering with @entity237 's , and is now in a care home			1
sadly he was unable to attend the game , but some of his former team - mates including @entity242 , were there , along with @entity236 ’ wife and family			1
@entity7 raised money for @entity237 's @entity247 on the day			2
all clubs have their legends , some have more than others			0
it ’s a beautiful thing that @entity7 did on saturday : not just fund - raising , but also ensuring new generations of @entity7 fans never forget the legends			2
tributes to a legend : @entity4 paid homage to former stalwart @entity231 , who has been diagnosed with @entity237 's disease special edition : the matchday programme featured an old - style cover paying tribute to @entity236			1

@entity11 could well be the slowest player in the @entity14
@entity11 does not score enough for a @entity14 striker
@entity104 's best days are behind him - he needs to rely on instincts
@entity183 's loan move from @entity197 to @entity2 is odd
@entity4 tribute to @entity236 was a class act
