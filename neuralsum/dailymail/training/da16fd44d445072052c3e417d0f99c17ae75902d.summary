' much better than that queen 's jubilee c * * p. ' ahead of the service , the @entity162 seemed keen to interview anyone it could - including mr @entity6 , who admitted his connection to the former prime minister was ' tenuous '			1
@entity168 wrote on @entity27 : ' @entity6 's commentary uncomfortably inappropriate for a @entity1 coverage of @entity3 's funeral that should be respectful today			1

mourning : the scenes of @entity3 's coffin being transported across @entity178 were missed by @entity10 presenters : @entity10 chose @entity93 and @entity92 to anchor their coverage , whereas the @entity1 went for the far more experienced @entity70 some web users also accused the @entity1 of being overly negative , focusing more on the possibility of unrest than the respectful mood felt by most bystanders			2
