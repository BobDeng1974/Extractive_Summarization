noisy neighbour : @entity7 kept at least 100 birds in his garden and locals were so upset about six years of noise they took him to court upsetting : the birds were kept in filthy conditions that has led to a total ban for @entity7 disturbance : the constant noise from birds such as these chickens forced neighbours to take legal actions as @entity7 just ignored them argument : @entity40 built a case against @entity7 and said the birds kept them awake at night and their filth attracted foxes and flies and polluted the air with their foul - smelling droppings at the height of the disruption even people living in nearby streets a mile away were knocking on the door of @entity7 's £ 190,000 detached house in @entity55 to complain about the noise			1
after pleading with him to get rid of the birds his fed - up neighbours ' pleas fell on deaf ears and they launched legal action against @entity7			1

and locals were celebrating today after magistrates prohibited @entity7 - who had already cleared the enclosure - from keeping animals in future			1
@entity7 denied causing a statutory nuisance under the 1990 @entity80 but was fined £ 100 and ordered to pay legal costs of £ 437.60 and a victim surcharge of £ 20			1
@entity83 heard how residents in @entity85 suffered frequent rat infestations after the pests were attracted by cast - off bird food			2
witnesses also told the court their sleep would be interrupted by the noise of panicked ducks whenever a fox squeezed through hall 's garden fence			1

' i 've lost count of the number of times we approached him - you 'd have a perfectly amicable conversation and he said he 'd sort it out - but nothing ever came of it			0
' he must have been oblivious to the noise and the smells but they were very obvious to everyone else			0
' despite threatening him with legal action it never seemed to spur him into cleaning the place up			0
