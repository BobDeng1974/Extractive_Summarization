' he 's done exceptionally well			0
we knew it would take a little bit of time for him to get to grips with the @entity26 and he 's done that			0
' he 's playing well			0
he 's a talented football player and i think he 's proving that in the @entity26			0
' at this stage of his career that he 's had disappointments such as being sent out on loan by @entity8 , the disappointments he had in terms of his game time and maybe how he was treated in certain situations			2
