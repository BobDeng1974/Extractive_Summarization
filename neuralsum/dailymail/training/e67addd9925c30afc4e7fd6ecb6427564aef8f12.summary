by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:54 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:01 est , 30 december 2013 discovery : painkillers found in @entity7 's chocolate and nut cones , pictured , could have been put there on purpose , police believe supermarket ice creams found to contain painkillers may have been deliberately spiked , police say			1
@entity7 was forced to recall boxes of its own - brand chocolate and nut cones last month after two were found to have been contaminated			1
now detectives believe the incident was sabotage			0
tablets were found in two separate cones in stores in different parts of the country and police are investigating the @entity26 factory near @entity27 , @entity28 , that supplies @entity7			1
detective superintendent @entity29 from the @entity31 ' major crime unit said : ' what we are trying to identify is how that product became contaminated			2
' it is a challenging investigation , because what we have got to try and identify was how and where and who was responsible for that contamination , and was it deliberate contamination			0
' with the process chain of all the ingredients that go into making an item like that , we do n’t know for sure where that contamination took place			0
' mr @entity29 added that the possibility of malicious contamination was ' one of the lines of inquiry ' and his ' gut instinct ' is that it was a ' deliberate contamination '			0
he added : ' if it was felt to be accidental from the outset , the resources we have put into it probably would n’t be to the scale we have done			2
' we have got to look at it as " we think it ’s suspicious unless we prove otherwise "			0
' @entity7 recalled its own - brand cones in november after two separate packets delivered to two different stores were found to contain the drugs			1
one tablet was found in a single cone in each packet			0
at the time the @entity67 warned consumers not to eat the product and to return it to @entity7 for a full refund			1
a @entity7 spokeswoman said : ' as a precautionary measure , we issued a product recall on @entity76 and @entity77 in november , after two individual cones were found to contain tablets			1
investigation : the supermarket chain withdrew the product november after two separate batchs were found to be contaminated ( library image ) ' we are currently investigating this incident with our supplier and we are helping the police with their enquiries			1
' @entity26 - which also produces leading brands including @entity97 lollies , @entity94 ’s @entity93 lollies , @entity88 ’s of @entity90 ice cream and @entity91 - said today they are keen to hear the results of the investigation			1
human resources director for the @entity26 @entity101 added police were ' now in the process of going through an investigation , that is taking some time '			0
he added : ' they have taken away details to have a look at and will let us know in due course what , if anything , they want to do further			0
' it is really a case of it being pending while they carry out their own investigation			0
' mr @entity101 added ' it is not something that would have been done in store , because it is two separate parts of the country so that has focused the police on the fact that it could be a potentially malicious act , perhaps by someone in the factory			1
' from our point of view , if there is evidence of anything where there is potential for a consumer to be injured in any way we need to find out how it happened			0
' if it is something like a tablet , which can not have been accidentally put into the product , it needs to be investigated to try and find the culprit			2
' @entity26 describes itself as one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of ice - cream in @entity149 .			2
