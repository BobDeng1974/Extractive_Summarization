by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity4 tea party brawl is n't over yet , an attorney for @entity8 @entity7 candidate @entity6 told reporters on monday , and the insurgent conservative 's campaign expects to find evidence of enough voter fraud in the june 24 primary runoff to trigger a new election			1
that would be the third bare - knuckle contest between @entity6 and six - term senator @entity18 , a 76 - year - old moderate @entity8 whose embrace of immigration reform and other liberal - leaning policies made him a prime target for the tea party movement			1
@entity6 campaign counsel @entity24 monday that he ' would be surprised if we do n’t find ' enough fraudulent votes to throw out the june 24 results			1
the campaign , he said , has already found ' thousands			0
' last week it was reported that an initial review of ballots flagged at least 4,900 ' irregularities			0
@entity6 came out on top but neither won at least 50 per cent of the vote			2
the runoff two weeks later was supposed to settle the matter			0
but complaints of fraud circulated throughout the state even before polls closed			0
they centered mostly on a seven - figure super pac set up to benefit him , which paid for advertisements encouraging @entity60 in majority - black counties to ' cross over ' and vote in the @entity8 runoff			1
the strategy is legal , but @entity60 can only participate in another party 's primary process if they have n't already voted in their own			1
@entity4 law provides for ' automatically a new election , ' @entity35 said monday , if the number of ' ineligible voters ' exceeds the margin of victory			1
that law , an election adviser in @entity75 , @entity4 , told @entity76 , would n't require @entity6 to find 6,700 fraudulent votes cast for his opponent			1
any 6,700 ineligible votes would suffice			2
' most of them , ' he said , ' are going to be absentee ballots			0
it 's too easy to scam , and nobody ever checks unless the margin is this close or the result this unexpected			0
' tension built monday as the @entity89 faced a 5:00 p.m. deadline to file its certified runoff results with state officials , and @entity6 aides fanned out across the state to work with county clerks to examine paper ballot applications from absentee voters			1
@entity35 said in a brief press conference that until monday the campaign 's representatives were not ' able to go into the courthouses , look in the ballot boxes and determine exactly what is contained in there , which includes the absentee information			1
and so , that is what we ’re going after today			0
' @entity18 's campaign does n't seem concerned			1
his spokesman @entity111 said in a statement that ' [ w ] e have representatives at all 82 courthouses today to monitor the review of ballot boxes and have been pleased with the results			0
' ' the county - by - county results reported thus far are revealing an extremely low number of crossover votes from the june 24th election			0
as the process moves forward , the conversation is shifting from wild , baseless accusations to hard facts			0
' @entity111 told @entity127 that @entity18 's campaign had found only one single crossover vote out of more than 2,000 votes cast in @entity130 ; three out of 4,000 in @entity135 ; five out of 2,000 cast in @entity132 ; and seven crossover voters out of more than 11,000 in @entity134			1
but the radio ads and fliers that blanketed black communities focused elsewhere in the state , including some with messages trying to tie @entity6 to the @entity141 in order to motivate @entity60 voters			1
the epicenter of the controversy is @entity146 , where @entity35 spoke near the courthouse steps			0
more than 169,000 of the county 's 245,000 residents are black , according to 2010 @entity151 data			0
last week , @entity6 offered a $ 1,000 reward for information proving that fraudulent votes were cast on june 24			2
' all citizens for @entity4 , ' a political committee that did n't legally exist before it produced and distributed literature like this flier , is one of the shadowy groups behind the cesspool - like politics in the @entity18 - @entity6 fight @entity163 vs. new blood : former @entity4 gov. and former @entity167 chairman @entity166 founded the super pac behind race - baiting ads that drove black @entity60 to vote against tea party candidate @entity6 ' it is imperative that an ineligible voter not be excluded from this , ' @entity35 said monday , ' because when i vote and there ’s an ineligible voter that also votes , he dilutes my vote			1
' @entity6 can challenge the result of the primary even after the results are certified , but he could also apply for an injunction in court on monday afternoon that would prohibit the @entity89 from finalizing its numbers			2
a more likely scenario , however , would see the @entity6 campaign filing a challenge with the party , and then in court once party leaders had been given 10 days to review it			2
and if @entity18 's victory turns out to be short - lived ? ' the correct remedy is a new election , ' @entity35 said			2
the eventual victor will square off against former @entity60 congressman @entity198 in a less contentious matchup expected to yield a @entity8 senator in a deeply red state			2
nationally , the @entity89 is teetering on the edge of reclaiming control of the @entity7			0
that accomplishment would put the @entity8 in control of both houses of @entity207 for the first time since 2007 .			0

tea party @entity8 @entity6 's campaign lawyer said monday that he expects to find enough voter fraud to force a third @entity7 primary contest with aging centrist @entity18
@entity18 won a runoff by about 6,700 votes , but @entity6 's attorney says campaign lawyers will almost certainly show at least that many ' ineligible voters ' cast ballots
@entity4 law would require a new election **–** after a primary fight and a runoff **–** between the two *republicans*
@entity6 's campaign is examining absentee ballot applications in every county to identify @entity60 who *illegally* ' crossed over ' to participate in the @entity8 primary after voting in the @entity60 primary
