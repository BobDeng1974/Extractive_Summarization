@entity0 has history for diving and the way he fell to try and win a penalty wo n’t help his reputation			2
there were two possible penalty incidents in close succession and @entity9 called both correctly			2
the first came as @entity11 burst into the penalty area only to be thwarted by a well - timed last - ditch @entity13 tackle , which took the ball cleanly			1
verdict : perfect tackle 61 mins 33 @entity22 @entity0 edges the ball past @entity27 , but drags his right foot against the defender			1
verdict : @entity30 round two : seconds later @entity0 tried to con the referee into awarding a spot - kick after an incident with @entity27 flop : the some - time @entity36 international throws himself into the air to try to coax a penalty out of @entity9 as the ball broke free , @entity0 took his chance by clipping the ball and then throwing himself theatrically to ground attempting to draw contact from @entity27			1
@entity9 saw it correctly and rightly cautioned @entity0			0
@entity36 v @entity46 ( october 2010 ) @entity0 was booked and denied a penalty after he claimed to be fouled twice during @entity36 ’s @entity49 qualifier			0
@entity51 v @entity50 ( april 2012 ) perhaps @entity0 ’s most theatrical tumble			0
the @entity51 man won his side a penalty when he flew through the air after minimal contact with @entity58			0
@entity51 v @entity59 ( april 2012 ) @entity0 ’s penalty - winning clash with @entity61 even prompted sir @entity62 to admit he ‘ overdid ’ the fall			1
@entity51 v @entity64 ( september 2013 ) @entity65 promises to reprimand the winger after admitting he tried to con the referee to give a penalty			0
@entity69 v @entity51 ( october 2013 ) @entity0 wins a penalty after a theatric reaction to a slight pull			1
@entity74 pundit @entity73 said : “ @entity0 has gone down too much in last few months ” .			0

@entity0 went to ground far too easily during the match against @entity21
@entity9 did well to spot the *midfielder* had left his trailing *leg* out as he *pushed* the ball past @entity27 in the penalty area at the @entity83
seconds beforehand @entity11 appealed for a penalty after being dispossessed inside the @entity21 *box* by @entity13
neither were given , as @entity9 got both the *decisions* spot on
the game finished 1 - 1 after @entity94 *'s* close - range finish for @entity51 was *cancelled* out by a @entity96 header *shortly* before half - time
