by @entity0 the writer of @entity2 , the latest @entity4 drama to face complaints over inaudible , mumbled dialogue , has admitted watcing the programme with the aid of subtitles			1
@entity11 - one of the @entity13 's best known screenwriters , whose work includes @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 - said he and his wife struggled to hear what the actors were saying , and required the assistance of subtitles to follow what was going on			1
@entity2 , which stars @entity25 and @entity26 , is the latest @entity4 series to experience mumbling actors and poor sound quality , after @entity30 was hit by the same complaints			1
mumbling cast : writer @entity11 said even his familiarity with the script of @entity2 - which stars @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) - was n't enough to follow what was happening on screen @entity11 , 77 , adapted @entity2 from the books by @entity39 - winning author @entity38 , but said that even his familiarity with the script was n't enough to follow what was happening on screen			2
settling down to watch the programme at their home in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity11 and his wife of 53 years , @entity49 , needed to read along with the dialogue in order to make sense of it			1
' she said , " do you mind if we have the subtitles on ? " , ' @entity11 explained to @entity55			2
' it 's a funny thing , mumbling			0
it 's a bit to do with actors , a bit do with with modern , flat - screen televisions and both my wife and i are of an age where our hearing is beginning to go , ' he added			2
@entity69 : @entity11 ( pictured ) said he and his wife struggled to hear the dialogue during @entity2 last week , a @entity4 spokesman said it had ' received complaints from some viewers unhappy with the sound quality during @entity2 '			1
' we appreciate that some viewers experienced problems with the sound when watching @entity2 , ' he added			0
' a wide range of factors can influence audibility and we are looking into why this should be and whether there are any steps we can take to improve the experience for the audience for episode two ... we will continue to work with others in the television industry on this important subject			0
' @entity11 said part of the problem with the sound may be that @entity2 's production staff are so familiar with the script that they subconsciously fill in the mumbled lines when they listen back during editing			2
' i could hear it because i knew what the words were			0
and i think that 's often the problem with the people in the production ... when you know what the lines are , there 's a tendency to think you 've heard them alright whereas if you did n't know the thing , maybe you would n't , ' he said			0
viewers watching the crime drama have reported having to turn the volume on their television sets up to the maximum setting , while others simply gave up and switched off			1
set in 1950s @entity123 , @entity2 follows the city ’s chief pathologist as he investigates a murder			0
but it seems many of the 4.2million who watched the first episode in the three - part series struggled to follow the action , with tv presenter @entity133 leading the complaints on @entity135			0
anger : tv star @entity133 was one of the viewers to vent his fury about the sound quality during @entity2 not the first time : the sound problems come after another @entity4 drama , @entity30 ( pictured ) , generated more than 2,000 complaints about ' incoherent mumbling ' @entity133 blamed the @entity4 ’s sound editing , tweeting : ‘ was really looking forward to @entity2 , @entity145 , 9pm – but despite winding volume up to 100 per cent , still ca n’t hear at least a third of dialogue ! again ! ' he later added : ‘ and it ’s definitely the programme – switched channels and sound boomed out massively loudly			1
back to @entity2 , and inaudible			0
grrrrrr ! ! ! ! ’ the sound problems come after another @entity4 drama , @entity30 , generated more than 2,000 complaints about ‘ incoherent mumbling ’ when it was broadcast in three parts of the @entity155 weekend			1
the @entity4 originally said that technical faults were responsible but following an investigation admitted another problem was that some of the cast had failed to deliver their lines clearly .			0

@entity11 , 77 , said he struggled to hear what actors were saying
his wife @entity49 asked if they could watch show with subtitles
