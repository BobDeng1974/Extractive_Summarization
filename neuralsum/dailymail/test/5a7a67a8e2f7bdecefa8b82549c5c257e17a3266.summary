@entity1 has seen a ' significant increase ' in the number of cases of @entity5 more than two weeks into a short - term needle exchange program approved by gov. @entity7 , state health officials said on friday			1
there are now 120 confirmed @entity5 cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to @entity11 , about 30 miles north of @entity12 , @entity13			1
that 's up from 106 last week , said the @entity16 @entity15			0
health officials who declared an epidemic last month have said they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested			1
but the growing number could put pressure on @entity7 to extend the 30 - day needle exchange program that he approved on march 26			1
the @entity11 outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high - powered painkiller @entity39 , health officials have said			1
the county typically sees about five @entity5 cases each year			2
since @entity7 approved the temporary needle exchange , 5,322 clean syringes have been provided to 86 participants , health officials said friday			1
about 1,400 used syringes have been returned			0
@entity47 , public health nurse for the @entity48 , said the needle - exchange program had ' really picked up a lot this week , ' in large part because a mobile unit has been traveling around neighborhoods seeking to get more iv drug users into the program			1
' it 's that trust factor			0
you have to gain that trust , and i think we 're slowly starting to do that , ' @entity47 said			0
but the future of the @entity11 program , as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle - exchange programs in other counties , is n't clear			1
the @entity11 outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high - powered prescription painkiller @entity39 , health officials have said @entity7 opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy			1
@entity77 president @entity76 @entity75 said on thursday that the emergency exchange for @entity11 was ' the right reaction ' but was n't sure if it is the correct approach long - term			1
nor was he sure whether the @entity77 would support legislation sponsored by @entity88 chairman @entity87 , @entity89 , that would allow the 23 @entity1 counties with the highest rate - per - population of hepatitis c to establish their own needle - exchange programs			2
the @entity90 reports that between 50 percent and 90 percent of people with hepatitis c are also infected with @entity5			0
health officials say because of this , high rates of hepatitis c are a key indicator of needle - sharing and a potential @entity5 outbreak			1
the @entity88 approved the bill on april 7 in a 54 - 39 vote , and the measure is scheduled for a hearing on monday in a @entity88 - @entity77 conference committee , which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the @entity108 's april 29 adjournment deadline			0
@entity75 said @entity7 is n't alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote drug use instead of prevent it			2
' at the same time , you adapt and you evolve based on the world we live in , so we 're going to have to see if that requires a pivot for us , ' @entity75 said			0
medical waste containers stored in preparation for @entity11 residents that are looking to exchange used needles			0
the needle - exchange program was created through an emergency executive order signed last week by gov. @entity7 in an attempt to curb the state 's largest - ever @entity5 outbreak @entity87 said he appreciates @entity7 's approval of the short - term needle exchange but that ' it does n't help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak			1
it 's just not enough			0
' he said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people , including lawmakers , uncomfortable			0
but he thinks the exchange program should n't be viewed as anti-drug policy , but as ' a proven and effective harm - reduction policy			2
' ' we simply ca n't afford to view this as a short - term problem , ' @entity87 said			1
money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options			0
since 1989 , the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs			2
@entity7 's executive order did n't include money for the @entity11 program			2
' they asked the state agencies to find their own money			0
how sustainable is that ? ' said dr. @entity159 , co-director of the @entity160 for @entity161 at @entity162			0
' there 's no evidence that the @entity7 administration is thinking about this in the long term at all			0

there are now 120 confirmed @entity5 cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to @entity11 , about 30 miles north of @entity12 , @entity13
outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high - powered prescription painkiller @entity39

gov. @entity7 approved a short - term needle exchange program two weeks *ago* to help combat the problem
