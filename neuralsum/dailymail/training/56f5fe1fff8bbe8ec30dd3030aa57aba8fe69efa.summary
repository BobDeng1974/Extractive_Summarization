@entity0 will speak with referees ’ chief @entity3 after @entity2 became the third @entity5 player to receive a straight red card in seven weeks			1
@entity5 will appeal against @entity8 ’s decision to send off @entity2 for using excessive force in what seemed to be a 50 - 50 challenge with @entity12			1
he appears to have a strong case			0
@entity0 said @entity12 had admitted to @entity5 goalkeeper @entity14 that he had actually fouled @entity2 , rather than the other way round			1
@entity2 was dismissed in the second half against @entity17 for a foul on @entity12 @entity5 boss @entity19 has said he is going to appeal the red card given to striker @entity2 the @entity5 forward takes the long walk from the pitch after being dismissed with the game drawn at 1 - 1 @entity25 was sent off for raising his hands at @entity28 ’s @entity27 in november and @entity29 was dismissed last week for a dangerous tackle on @entity32 midfielder @entity31			1
@entity8 is the most decisive referee in the select group with straight red cards , but sometimes he sees ones which are not there			2
when @entity2 went into a strong challenge with @entity12 it was hard to see who made the foul			1
both were committed and the @entity5 man ’s momentum meant he caught @entity12 on the follow - through			1
@entity8 would not have been influenced by @entity17 ’s players surrounding him and he had already decided			2
i hope the card is rescinded on appeal			2
@entity0 is concerned @entity5 could be getting a bad reputation			2
it ’s not right , ’ he said			0
‘ i probably will have a call ( to @entity3 )			0
i ’ll find out exactly what is going on			0
the @entity29 one i do n’t have a problem			0
the one against @entity17 i certainly have a problem			2
‘ the two of them went for a fair challenge			0
when their lad says he fouled @entity62 , that ’s where it falls down			0
‘ you have a fourth official and a linesman			0
in that moment , that magnitude of a game , you ’ve got to be 100 per cent right			0
’ @entity0 confirmed that @entity5 would be appealing against the 65th - minute dismissal			1
after @entity29 saw red last week @entity2 was @entity5 's third straight dismissal in seven weeks @entity25 was given his marching orders for raising his hands at @entity28 's @entity27			1

@entity0 said he had a problem with red card against @entity17
@entity2 was *dimissed* for a tackle on @entity17 's @entity12
the red card was @entity5 's third straight dismissal in just seven weeks
