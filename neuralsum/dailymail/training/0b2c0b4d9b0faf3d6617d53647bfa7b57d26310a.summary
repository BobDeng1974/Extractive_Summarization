by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 04:28 est , 6 march 2013 an oil tycoon worth ‘ tens of millions ’ is establishing a ‘ cheats ’ charter ’ for divorcing husbands by hiding his money in companies , the @entity1 was told			1
businessman @entity8 , 51 , is supposed to be paying ex-wife @entity9 £ 270,000 a year - but instead is giving her just £ 150 a week in cash , less than the minimum wage			1
and although he was previously ordered by the @entity12 to give her a lump sum of £ 17.5m and several @entity16 houses , he managed to quash that order at the @entity18 in october by claiming the millions of pounds in cash and properties held by companies he controls should not be counted as his assets			2
battle : @entity8 , left , is ' hiding his millions ' from ex-wife @entity26 after being ordered to give her a lump sum of £ 17.5million now , in a divorce case that has built up legal costs estimated to exceed £ 3m , mrs @entity26 , 50 , who has four children by her ex-husband , has appealed to @entity16 ’s @entity1 to get her hands on the fortune			1
the ruling could set a precedent for countless other warring couples			0
mrs @entity26 is understood to still live in the £ 4m marital home in exclusive @entity38 , west @entity16			1
technically , her court battle is against three @entity41 - registered companies under her husband ’s control : @entity45 , @entity46 , and @entity47			2
her barrister @entity48 told the court yesterday : ‘ it is not hyperbole to say that this is a case where , if the companies succeed , this wife will be rendered destitute			0
‘ they say it is not the case that this is a “ cheats ’ charter ” , even though it would result in mr @entity8 and his companies coming away with tens of millions of pounds , while the wife is reduced to claiming benefits			1
‘ they say it is not a cheats ’ charter because there are potentially other remedies available to the wife			0
we say that is not so			0
’ mr @entity72 said although mr @entity8 claimed she could simply be given shares in the companies , their whole management was so much in his hands , and he had already woven such a ‘ web of deceit in respect of ownership of these shares that it would be impossible to ever work out what the position is ’			2
seeking any such agreement with mr @entity8 , said mr @entity72 , ‘ is going to result in her being led a merry dance without any reward ’			2
the barrister went on : ‘ the husband , who is resident in @entity89 , simply uses these companies as his piggy bank			0
‘ he is supposed to be paying mrs @entity26 £ 270,000 per annum , but he simply chooses not to pay that			1
‘ the true position is that he is paying mrs @entity26 £ 150 cash per week - £ 7,800 per annum - a little bit less than the minimum wage			1
’ lawyers acting for @entity98 at the @entity1 in @entity16 said her ex-husband could leave her ' destitute ' mr @entity72 said the businessman had also ignored orders to pay massive legal costs , although his companies were financing the four children through ‘ the finest public schools with a bill exceeding £ 100,000 per annum ’			1
he said the wife had managed to identify two properties owned by the companies which arguably could be sold and the money given to her - but mr @entity8 claimed they were in negative equity			1
mr @entity72 went on to say that if mr @entity8 and his companies won the @entity1 case , other husbands would similarly be able to dishonestly hide their assets from their wives in companies , behind a ‘ corporate veil ’			2
if the case went mr @entity8 ’s way , he said , the @entity121 , put into law to give divorcing spouses a fair share of their assets , would be rendered useless			2
he said : ‘ mr @entity8 has exhibited a strong desire to thwart the intentions of the court			0
‘ it is effectively the companies ’ case that we would have a cheats ’ charter			0
‘ it would be a simple matter to incorporate a company , or better still use a company already incorporated , in order to retain assets and make them judgement - proof in a case such as this			0
’ ‘ this would be that very cheats ’ charter , it would reduce the @entity121 to being nothing more than a scarecrow			0
’ mr @entity72 added that the court should ‘ pierce the corporate veil ’ mr @entity8 was hiding his fortune behind and simply treat the companies ’ assets as his			2
in previous hearings in the lengthy divorce campaign , @entity156 mr @entity8 had been criticised by a judge who told him he was treating the case ‘ as a game ’ by claiming to be £ 48m in debt when his @entity163 companies had a turnover of almost £ 2.5bn a year			1
the @entity12 estimated his wealth to be at least £ 37.5m when it ordered him to give almost half that to mrs @entity26			1
but he then referred to ‘ native ’ @entity168 law in his successful appeal , claiming that under customary @entity156 law he was head of his extended family , and held his company assets in trust for them			0
he met his @entity176 - born and @entity41 - raised wife in @entity16 and they married in 1993			0
he was named one of the most influential black men in @entity180 in 2007			0
mrs @entity26 originally sought a payout of more than £ 30m and said she and the children needed £ 730,000 a year to cover their ‘ reasonable needs ’			1
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity8 , 51 , should be paying ex-wife @entity9 £ 270,000 a year
he is instead giving her £ 150 a week - less than the minimum wage
mrs @entity26 *'s* lawyers allege he is hiding millions in *offshore* companies
protracted legal battle has already cost an estimated £ *3million*
