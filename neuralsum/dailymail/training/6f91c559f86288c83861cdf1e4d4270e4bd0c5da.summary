@entity0 can become a @entity2 legend @entity3 let themselves down with their set - pieces against @entity5 @entity6 deserves praise for building @entity5 's £ 200m @entity8 when i wrote in this column recently that @entity11 are on the brink of something very special under @entity14 , i did n't expect it to happen this season			1
but right now they look like they 're the only team capable of catching the top two and that means they are in the title race			0
not many would have thought that possible after the 5 - 3 defeat at @entity23			0
but as i said after that game , @entity11 were brilliant going forward , and crumbled after a shocking refereeing decision gave @entity23 a way back into the game			2
@entity28 ( centre ) celebrates his winning goal against @entity31 at @entity32 's on monday night @entity34 @entity33 pops up at the back post to convert @entity37 's free - kick for his second goal @entity33 raises his arm in celebration after giving @entity11 a 1 - 0 lead on the south coast that experience built character			1
as @entity45 pointed out after the final whistle , @entity11 handled mistakes and setbacks better than @entity31 did on monday night			1
@entity11 were atrocious at times , they could barely pass the ball to each other and yet they won the game			2
their strengths are in their finishers – @entity37 and @entity28 do n't need many chances - and that worked in @entity11 's favour at @entity32 's			1
there were only three attempts on goal from @entity11 – the lowest in the @entity63 this season			1
and the lowest number created by a @entity11 side in a game for 11 years			2
but they took two of them			0
that is impressive , and it gave them three points			0
with @entity75 out injured for a while , @entity5 will need to answer questions			2
@entity78 need to show they can recover from a setback and respond positively			0
@entity11 's main strength is their finishers like @entity33 , pictured here scoring his first goal past @entity83 @entity5 will need to cope without star striker @entity75 after he was injured against @entity3 @entity85 's @entity84 scores his second goal as @entity78 suffered their first defeat of the season @entity11 's injury list could ease significantly soon – @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 in particular could make a difference			1
they are also set to spend another small fortune in january , which should improve them			0
@entity11 are not playing well , they are nowhere near their peak performance and yet they are third in the table , having won five games in succession , and having only lost once – to the champions – in 10 games , since that defeat to at @entity23			0
there are three men who i believe are chiefly responsible for @entity11 being in the title race			0
@entity111 ( left ) admitted that @entity45 's side were the better team on a chilly night at @entity32 's 1 ) @entity14 he 's a class act , and he 's always ready to make difficult decisions when necessary – like taking @entity115 off in the first half at @entity31 when he lacked confidence and was making too many mistakes			1
that was bold and brave but it worked for @entity11			0
at the same time it sent a message to the rest of the @entity11 players that they need to be totally on top of their game			2
@entity111 needed to make the change , but he taught the @entity11 squad a lesson at the same time			1
@entity11 boss @entity14 has inspired his team to five successive victories in the @entity63 2 ) @entity37 a captain , a leader , and a man ready to do whatever it takes to get @entity11 back to where they were before sir @entity138 retired			1
he is proving himself to be a worthy talisman for club and country and it 's clear the rest of the players respect him			0
his tireless running with the ball as the @entity31 game drew to a close took the pressure off @entity11 at the back and gave them an outlet in the opposition half			1
@entity11 captain @entity37 has played a pivotal role for @entity111 's side so far this season 3 ) @entity155 his calm and composure have been crucial during this winning run			1
since he returned to the side he has relaxed everyone around him			0
he will always accept the ball , always be available and he never hides			0
that is exactly what an under - pressure defence needs			0
@entity155 is a team - mate who will always help you out			2
@entity14 must be so relieved to have him fit and in the side			2
the added bonus is that the manager knows he can also trust @entity155 at centre - half			2
@entity155 ( left ) has brought a calming presence to @entity11 's midfield since returning from injury can @entity11 win the title ? i would n't put money on it			1
but it would be the most impressive turn around in @entity63 history if they did			0
to even be talking about @entity11 as title contenders shows what an amazing job @entity111 has done already			1
while some are busy trying to convince themselves the loan deal for @entity185 was a terrible error from @entity11 , @entity111 has led them up to third in the table			1
the @entity11 haters must be raging in their sleep ! @entity190 here to like our @entity11 facebook page .			0

@entity11 beat @entity31 2 - 1 at @entity32 's on monday night
@entity14 's side are now third , eight points behind leaders @entity78

@entity111 has inspired his players to five @entity63 wins in a *row*
