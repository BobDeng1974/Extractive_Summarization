by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 15 september 2012 updated : 01:58 est , 17 september 2012 the @entity1 claims his work in the @entity4 is complete despite being due to retire soon the @entity1 has resigned as the head of the @entity4 after a failed attempt to overhaul its image			1
the 60 - year - old @entity1 , who is called major general @entity9 when in uniform , called for the @entity4 to be renamed @entity11 in a bid to shed its ‘ @entity14 ’ reputation			1
but according to military sources , his campaign was defeated ‘ almost unanimously ’ by senior colleagues			1
now , the @entity1 , who is @entity19 ’s wealthiest landowner and worth £ 7 billion , has left the @entity4 ’s headquarters in @entity21 , @entity22 , and his post as deputy commander , @entity26			1
he will concentrate on raising funds for projects such as the £ 300 million refurbishment of a stately home to turn it into the country ’s biggest rehabilitation centre for wounded troops and civilians			1
he has also resigned from the @entity36 to focus on the same cause			0
the @entity1 , who was due to retire from his @entity4 post in six months , said last night his ‘ work was done ’ after a 40 - year career			1
a @entity4 officer told @entity43 : ‘ he was very frustrated to have not persuaded his colleagues of the merits of changing the name from @entity4 to @entity11			1
‘ to him , the name @entity4 was out of date and demeaning to the soldiers who give up their jobs to fight in @entity53			2
he spent a year trying to push this through , meeting a lot of resistance			0
he is not a man to stand on ceremony or give up easily			0
i am stunned and disappointed that he has gone , but his record in the @entity4 will be long remembered			2
‘ he was promoted from the junior rank of trooper to major general and achieved changes such as ensuring part - time troops are paid the same as our day jobs when we deploy			0
' job done ' : the @entity1 ( right ) resigns as head of the @entity4 after failing to overhaul its image ‘ i would have liked him to have won the name - change argument because the name @entity74 suggests all the @entity4 does is defend home territory			1
yet at any one time there are 500 @entity19 reservists fighting the @entity78			0
’ the @entity1 ’s final defeat came at this summer ’s @entity81 conference staged by the @entity82			2
he was told by senior @entity4 officers that there was nothing wrong with the @entity4 brand and the name should remain unchanged			2
undeterred , he changed the title of the @entity4 ’s magazine , @entity89 , to @entity90 for its most recent edition			2
an editorial which appeared beneath his signature read : ‘ the more observant reader will have noticed that the name of the magazine has changed			0
the debate has been going on for years over whether the @entity4 should change its name			2
‘ in favour of the new name are those who say that the name no longer represents what we do and that today ’s @entity4 is as operationally mobile as the @entity106			0
on the side of the status quo are those who point out that the brand is strong			0
’ the @entity1 leaves the @entity4 at a time when it is being expected to increase its deployable numbers			1
the @entity1 attempted to rebrand the @entity4 as @entity11 in a bid to shed it 's ' @entity14 ' reputation a @entity4 regiment were awarded their @entity116 after returning from a six month tour of duty in @entity53 in theory the @entity4 consists of 37,000 deployable troops but in practice only about 14,000 are trained and available for use overseas			1
by 2020 , it is hoped the @entity4 will form an integral part of a 120,000 - strong @entity123 , including 36,000 fully trained reservists ready to meet any challenge anywhere in the world			0
the @entity1 ’s rehabilitation centre at @entity128 , @entity129 , is expected to open in 2018			0
he is leading the refurbishment programme at the @entity133 - listed £ 6.25 million mansion which he has donated to the nation			0
the @entity1 said last night : ‘ i have served in the @entity11 for more than 40 years and while i was due to have retired next spring , i have decided to retire earlier			1
as far as i am concerned , the strategic job is done and i have achieved what i wanted to achieve			0

the @entity1 called for the @entity4 to be renamed @entity11
senior colleagues *dismissed* the idea and the @entity1 has now left the @entity4 's headquarters in @entity21 , @entity22
@entity1 will turn attention to a £ 300m stately home refurbishment
