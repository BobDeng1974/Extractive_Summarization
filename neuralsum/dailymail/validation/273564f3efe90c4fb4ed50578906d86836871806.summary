@entity0 is determined to complete his remarkable journey from ' game over ' to home city glory when he puts his @entity5 welterweight title on the line for the first time in @entity8 on saturday night			1
the 28 - year - old will take to the ring against @entity12 @entity11 less than six months after a horrific machete attack in @entity14 which left him fighting for his life with blood pouring from a 12 - inch wound			1
and having fought his way up through the city 's sports halls and leisure centres to finally top the bill in front of an expected crowd of more than 10,000 , @entity0 admitted his biggest battle might be to stop his emotions getting the better of him			1

' i thought , ' this is game over for me now ' , but i remember getting to the hospital and being wheeled out and feeling the fresh air and seeing the birds flying about and thinking ' i 'm here , i 'm alive '			0
' i think when you 've been that close to death it definitely changes you			0
' it is going to be hard going from the leisure centres to packing out the @entity58 , but i was born to do this and i believe i perform better under pressure			2
' it took me a long time to get this belt and with what i 've had to go through there is no way on this earth @entity11 is taking it off me			2
i 've kept everyone waiting and they are in for a real treat			0
' @entity0 took the title from previous holder @entity73 in @entity75 in august and knows victory over @entity11 could pave the way to much more lucrative bouts in the 147lbs division			1
while his stated aim of sealing a showdown with the winner of the may super-fight between @entity86 and @entity87 may be over-ambitious , plenty of other potential money - spinning bouts remain			0
@entity0 claimed the @entity5 welterweight title in 2014 when he defeated the previous holder @entity73 ( left ) brook and @entity11 square up with one another ahead of their @entity5 title match in @entity8 on saturday @entity0 has also expressed an interest in facing @entity86 or @entity87 in the near future and while @entity0 is right not to under - estimate his @entity94 - based opponent , it is hard to see how the 33 - year - old @entity11 is likely to pose much of a threat			1
his record is a solid enough 34 - 2 with 18 stoppage wins , but his two losses came on his only two previous forays anywhere near top class , both against @entity102 opponent @entity101 in 2010 and 2011			0
@entity0 added : ' you can never look past any opponent and you never know what is going to happen - you have to take every fight and every day at a time			2
' if you are asking me if i want to fight @entity86 or @entity87 , of course i do			0
i 'm the world champion and i 'm leading the way and i 've got to look for the higher profile fights			0
' it is a piping hot division and it just makes it all the better that i 'm the world champ and you 've got all these other top fighters who want what i 've got			0
' brook and @entity11 shake hands ahead of their @entity5 welterweight title match in @entity8 on saturday			1

@entity0 will defend his @entity5 welterweight title against @entity11 less than six months after a horrific machete attack which almost killed him
