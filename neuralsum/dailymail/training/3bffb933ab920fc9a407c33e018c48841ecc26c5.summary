the painkillers are taken by millions of @entity11 to keep their blood thin and cut the risk of potentially deadly clots			1
and a major heart conference was told blood cells were least likely to bind dangerously together following a bedtime aspirin			1
in the study , 290 people were asked to take a low - dose aspirin every morning for three months , then before bedtime for three months			1
at the end of each period , they underwent tests on their blood pressure and platelets			1
platelets are tiny cells in the blood that make it clot			2
aspirin makes it harder for them to stick together and so cuts the odds of them forming a clump that could trigger a heart attack or stroke			2
the treatment of 100mg of aspirin a day did not cut blood pressure			1
however , taking the drug at bedtime did make it more difficult for the platelets to stick together in the morning – the peak time for heart attacks			1
lead researcher dr @entity45 , of @entity46 in the @entity47 , said : ‘ this simple intervention – switching aspirin intake from morning to bedtime – could be beneficial for the millions of patients with heart disease who take aspirin on a daily basis			1
’ however , @entity11 experts said it was too early for patients to make any changes on the back of the study			2
@entity60 , of the @entity61 , said : ‘ we know aspirin can be vital in reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke			2
research into the best time to take a daily dose of aspirin is an interesting idea , but we would need to see much larger and longer studies before a change in practice can be recommended			0
‘ for now , keep taking your daily aspirin as recommended by your doctor			0
if you have any concerns about your medication , talk it through with your gp			0

previous research has shown aspirin cuts the risk of certain cancers by more than 40 per cent millions of @entity11 who have survived a heart attack or stroke take low - dose aspirin each day to keep their blood thin			1
it is also taken by some smokers and others considered to be at risk of having a first heart attack			0
some ‘ worried well ’ also take a daily dose of the painkiller as a form of health insurance			0
many will take it first thing in the morning , to prevent them from forgetting it and to get it out of the way for the day			0
previous research has shown aspirin cuts the risk of certain cancers by more than 40 per cent , even when only taken every other day			0
@entity112 researchers in the @entity113 found that even a very low dose of the painkiller drastically reduces the odds of bowel and stomach cancers			0
women who took one 100mg tablet every other day were 43 per cent less likely to get bowel cancer and 36 per cent less at risk of stomach cancer , after a period of 20 years .			0
