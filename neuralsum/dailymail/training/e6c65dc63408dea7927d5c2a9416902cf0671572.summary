a mother who was rushed to hospital with severe back ache was stunned to discover she was actually nine months ' pregnant			2
@entity3 , from @entity4 , woke up early one morning in agony , having worked a long shift as an assistant bar manager the day before			1
within 24 hours , she had become a mother for the second time after the arrival of her son @entity10			2
shock : @entity3 was suffering from extreme back pain and had no idea she was pregnant			1
her son @entity10 was born just hours later ms @entity3 had been taking the pill daily and had periods as normal , but as her agony increased en - route to hospital , she claims noticed a bump appear on her stomach			1
baffled doctors decided to give her a pregnancy test , which came back positive			1
@entity10 was born just hours later , weighing 8lb 5oz			2
ms @entity3 says she had no idea she was pregnant ,			1
in fact , friends had even told her she had lost weight			1
alongside working 14 - hour shifts , she had fallen down the stairs at her home three months before			2
she said : ' it 's come as just a little bit of a shock , to say the least			1
ms @entity3 had been taking the pill daily and had periods as normal , but as her agony increased en - route to hospital , she claims noticed a bump appear on her stomach ' i think the biggest surprise is that i did n't have a clue i was pregnant			1
i felt nothing at all , there was no morning sickness and i was just getting along with work and everything else			2
' for a few days i felt extremely tired , but i put it down to working 40 to 50 hours a week			2
' after finishing work the night before at 11.30pm , she woke up with severe backache and called her sister when the pain got worse			0
ms @entity3 , 32 , who also has son @entity53 , 11 , from a previous relationship , said : ' the aches were getting worse and worse			1
she asked me how i felt and i said it was as though i was in labour			0
' i then noticed a bump had formed on my stomach and knew something was n't right			0
the news was even more of a surprise because ms @entity3 's partner @entity63 ( left ) takes medication for @entity66 's disease that makes having a child risky ' when i got to hospital they gave me a pregnancy test and i was stunned to hear it had come back positive			1
' ms @entity3 's partner , 35 - year - old @entity72 , was stunned to receive a phone call at work from nurses at the nearby @entity76 , @entity77 , explaining that he was going to be a father			1
he said : ' my colleagues had to pick me up from the floor			0
we had n't planned the pregnancy at all			1
i thought it was a wind - up			0
the news was a particular surprise for mr @entity72 , as he suffers from @entity66 's disease			1
doctors had told him he may never be able to start a family because the medication he was on would make it ' too dangerous '			1
@entity10 with his older brother @entity53 , 11 @entity91 , @entity93 's maternity clinical services matron and supervisor of midwives , said ms @entity3 's case was rare			1
she said : ' i can count on my one hand how many i have seen in my 30 - year career here at @entity76			0
' women who may be a little taller or overweight tend to show much less [ signs of pregnancy ] , whilst menopausal women and younger busy women who are not expecting to be pregnant will simply not be looking for signs			1
' even a baby 's kicking can be easily mistaken for indigestion			1
' in some births , such as @entity3 's , babies lie with their back against their mother 's back			1
this is called the occipito - posterior ( @entity116 ) position			0
in this case if the baby is lying @entity116 or ' back to your back ' , the pregnant bump may feel squashy and mothers may feel baby kicks in the middle of their abdomen			0
' i would like to wish @entity3 and her new baby , @entity10 , all the best for the future			1
' a new mother gave birth in her bathroom just hours after being sent home by midwives who insisted she was n't in labour			0
@entity136 , 28 , phoned the @entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 , when she developed severe back pains on her due date			0
but despite showing the classic signs of contractions , nurses assured her the birth was imminent and instead advised her to stay home and take paracetamol			1
@entity136 was told by doctors she was n't in labour and sent home			2
three hours later , she gave birth to baby @entity150 in her bathroom when the pain got worse her husband @entity151 , 30 , drove her to the hospital			0
but after being examined nurses again insisted that she was not in labour and discharged her with ' back pain '			0
she ended up giving birth just two hours after arriving back at home , while sitting on the toilet			0
mrs @entity136 , from @entity160 , @entity139 , said : ' after they sent me home from hospital i tried to sleep , but by 2.30am the pain had got much worse and i could n't get comfy			0
i had all the signs that i was in labour			2
' i felt the urge to push so i went to the toilet to try and ease the pain but when i realised what was happening i just sort of gave birth			0
' i shouted to @entity151 to grab his head , but before i knew it @entity150 was in my arms			0
' i just took one push and he was out , i had him in my arms and thankfully he was just crying and crying			0
' @entity151 called the paramedics and they arrived within about seven minutes			0
' i ca n't believe they kept sending me away , it 's shocking			2
luckily we were all ok , but imagine if we were n't			0
it 's a very scary experience			2
' i 'm very angry with how i have been let down			0
' mrs @entity136 later complained to the hospital , which apologised and agreed to reimburse her for any furniture damaged during the birth .			0
