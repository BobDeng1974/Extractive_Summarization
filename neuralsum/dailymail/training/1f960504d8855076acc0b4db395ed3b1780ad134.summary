a study has revealed that emotional attachment is more hurtful than extra-marital sex women would rather their partners had a fling than form an emotional bond with another female , according to research			1
a recent study found that two - thirds of women said emotional attachment is more hurtful than extra-marital sex			1
but for men , just a third said that their partner forming an emotional bond with another man was more painful than having a passionate affair with them			1
four - fifths of women said they would be more jealous of their partner falling in love with someone else than trying different sexual positions with another woman			2
while over half of men said the idea of their partner in bed with someone else was a bigger upset			2
the @entity34 study , which polled 477 adults , was published in the journal @entity37			2
the participants were quizzed on different scenarios of emotional and sexual infidelity , and asked which would be more hurtful			0
generally , women found that their partners ’ emotional transgressions were more hurtful than cheating on them physically			1
it was the opposite for men , with most being more hurt by their partners ’ sexual affairs			1
when both love and infidelity occurred together it was physical cheating which was overwhelmingly the biggest betrayal for males , but not females			0
a third of women said they would be more hurt if their partner was sexually interested in a former lover , than if they became emotionally involved with an old flame			0
again , the opposite was true for men , with the majority being more hurt by any sexual interest with a former partner			1
researchers questioned participants over their own lifestyle , morality , how emotionally close they were with partners , and sexual history			1
men are hurt in the opposite way to women , with the majority being more hurt by any sexual interest with a former partner lead author dr @entity77 , from @entity78 , said : ‘ males reported that sexual infidelity scenarios were relatively more distressing than emotional infidelity scenarios , and the opposite was true of females			1
’ dr @entity77 said that men and women ’s fundamental attitudes were divided			1
he said : ‘ no factors showed a stronger relationship with reactions to infidelity than participant sex			0
‘ this research finds no evidence that the specific beliefs about infidelity , sex roles , attachment styles , reported socio - sexual orientation , or cognitive styles are driving the consistent sex differences found in reactions to different types of infidelity scenarios			0
’ he said there was a long running debate over whether it was nurture or nature that had created such opposing sexual attitudes			0
dr @entity77 wrote in the journal that evolutionary psychologists believed the difference was down to ‘ men facing a problem of paternity uncertainty ’			0
he continued : ‘ men can never be absolutely certain that an infant carries their genes			0
‘ this prospect should make men differentially sensitive to sexual infidelity on the part of their mate			0
‘ women , on the other hand , confront a different potential problem of ensuring continued paternal investment by the sire of their child			0
‘ this possibility should make women differentially sensitive to emotional infidelity of their mate			2

women would rather partners have fling than emotional affair
men have opposite reaction on average , *preferring* emotional treachery
researchers from @entity78 examined *447* adults for results
