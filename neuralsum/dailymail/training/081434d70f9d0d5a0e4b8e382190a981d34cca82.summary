' you need a structure , and this is a structure , ' the judge told @entity3 before the actress accepted the terms of her new probation by @entity8 reporter last updated at 11:38 am on 3rd november 2011 @entity3 has been sentenced to serve 30 days in jail after admitting she violated her probation			1
the troubled actress waived her rights at her probation violation hearing at the @entity16 superior @entity14 and admitted the violation			2
judge @entity18 ordered the actress so surrender to the jail by november 9			2
she was not immediately put behind bars because the judge decided to allow her time to complete her nude photo shoot for @entity23 , according to @entity24			2
heading back to jail : @entity3 , pictured here arriving at an @entity16 court today , has until november 9 to surrender for a 30 - day term another day , another court hearing : the star admitted to violating her probation in theft and @entity33 cases the star 's lawyer , @entity34 , is understood to have told the judge in chambers that her client had a $ 1 million contract with @entity41 's publication			1
@entity3 's jail sentence was n't the only talking point today			2
the mark on the actress ' left arm also caught the eye of some observers			0
while at first glance it appears to be a mere grimy smudge or bruise , it is in fact , an unfinished @entity49 had outline of a young angelic girl ( illustrated in full below ) inked on last year			0
it was chosen because ' she liked the innocence of the girl ' , according to reports at the time , but it has never been completed			0
she must completed the shoot this week or face being in breach of her contract and @entity18 decided to allow her one week to surrender , the website reports			0
in court , the judge imposed an otherwise strict probation regime , telling the actress : ' i 'm giving you the keys to the jail			1
' judge @entity18 said : ' @entity77 you are going to waive your right to the hearing and admit the violation , do you understand ? ' @entity3 replied : ' yes , your honour ' @entity18 then sentenced the actress to 30 days in jail with 270 days to be stayed as long as @entity3 complies with her probation conditions			1
the jail time can be reduced due to overcrowding in @entity16 jails - but @entity87 was firm there was to be no house arrest or electronic monitoring			0
@entity24 reports that she may serve just minutes behind bars			1
a source within the @entity95 's @entity94 told the website that if someone receives a misdemeanor sentence of 90 days or less , they are routinely processed in and then released			0
' she 'll be out without even having to change her clothes , ' the insider says			0
judge @entity18 told @entity3 : ' you are to surrender by november 9 and begin serving 30 days			1
' you will not be eligible for house arrest or electronic monitoring			0
' when you get out you will report to the probation department and ms @entity106			0
good luck to you with ms @entity106 - she is no nonsense			0
' as well as serving the jail time the actress must continue her community service at the @entity16 county morgue			1
in order to comply with the judge 's strict order @entity3 will spend virtually every day she is not in jail at the morgue			1
judge @entity18 said : ' the sentence i am going to impose is known as putting the keys to jail in the defendant 's hands			0
' if she fails to abide by the schedule she could be sent locked up for another 270 days			0
demure : the actress opted for a high - neck polka dot dress judge @entity18 may have sentenced @entity3 to 30 days in jail			1
but in all likeliness , the actress may not even spend a single night there - due to jail overcrowding			2
@entity3 has to surrender to jail by november 9			2
@entity133 , a spokesman for the @entity134 , told @entity24 said how long she stays in jail depends on when she decides to check herself in			0
officials told the website that misdemeanour inmates only tend to serve 20 per cent of their sentence - although inmates sentenced to 90 days or less are processed and released immediately			2
home from home : @entity141 where @entity3 has served jail time in the past only a backlog of people to process or delays in paperwork might mean @entity3 would have to stay the night			2
even though @entity149 was strict about the terms of @entity3 's sentence , prison officials told @entity24 that a federal court order on overcrowding ' trumps everything '			1
in another twist , @entity3 could be in jail on the same day as her father @entity157 , who is currently in solitary confinement in the infirmary of the @entity161 jail in @entity162			2
while @entity3 has to surrender to jail on november 9 , her father will appear in court on the same day to face a judge on charges stemming from the breach of a restraining order against his former fiance @entity169			1
it follows allegations he assaulted her - and he could face jail time for allegedly breaching the restraining order and contacting her			0
at the beginning of the hearing the @entity16 prosecutor told judge @entity177 had failed to keep appointments at court mandated psychologist therapy sessions and failed to attend mandated service at a downtown women 's shelter in @entity16 ' rough skid row area			1
judge @entity18 said she had made enquiries for @entity3 to work at the @entity186 shelter for abused families in @entity16 but they did not want her			1
she said : ' they were unwilling to take you because they do not think you are a good example for women trying to put their lives back together			0
' however , the @entity16 morgue where @entity3 has already been serving community service was happy to keep the actress on , @entity18 said			1
ready for her close up : the media gathered outside the courtroom to capture the star 's arrival ' i am converting all your community service to the morgue , ' @entity18 said			1
when @entity3 is released from jail she will have to report back to the court december 14th having already completed 12 days at the morgue			0
she will then have to complete 12 days community service before a hearing on january 17 to have the 270 day jail sentence stayed			1
she will have to complete an additional 12 days by february 17 to have the sentence stayed again			0
and finally she must complete another 17 days by march 29 , which if she completes successfully will result in her sentences being commuted to summary probation without her having to appear in court or see judge @entity18 again			0
' you need a structure , and this is a structure , ' the judge told @entity3 before the actress accepted the terms of her new probation			1
judge @entity18 also told @entity3 she must attend every court ordered psychological therapy session without fail			1
@entity18 said @entity3 should be under no illusion that if she fails to stick to the letter of her orders she will serve the additional 270 days			2
' if probation officer ms @entity106 notifies me i will put a warrant out for your arrest , ' she said .			0
