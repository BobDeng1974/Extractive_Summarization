when @entity1 graced the @entity2 , it served as a stunning showpiece of the console ’s power			1
the same can be said for @entity7			2
indeed , when you ’re first treated to hundreds of the undead roaming the streets of @entity12 , @entity13 , it ’s a wonderful glimpse inside the @entity15 ’s graphical potential			1
sadly , within 30 minutes , boring , repetitive mission structure sets in and undoes all the hard work			1
view to a kill : make too much noise and you 'll quickly be surrounded by hordes of the undead set 10 years after the events of @entity25 , you play @entity26 , who has to escape the city before the army levels it with airstrikes			0
basic plot , yes – but in similar vein to the other games , dead rising 3 tries to make the battle for survival as entertaining as possible			0
a large part of this revolves around the combat			0
@entity40 is littered with potential weapons – from plant pots and hairdryers , to more damaging kitanas , baseball bats , guns and machetes			1
but it ’s the ability to create and combine weapons that hold the most intrigue , the best of which involves splicing a motorcycle engine with some boxing gloves			1
vehicles , too , can be modified			2
full steam ahead : the @entity56 ( above ) is easily the best combination vehicle in the game strewn around the city , usable cars , bikes and lorries are indicated by flashing lights			0
in their ‘ naked ’ form , they ’re easily damaged – with several zombies hanging on to your bumper and bonnet within seconds of starting the engine			2
but when spliced with other vehicles , they become different beasts all together			2
the @entity56 is perhaps the best example – a mix of motorbike and a steamroller , mounted with flamethrowers and capable of mowing down undead hordes within seconds			0
there are also plenty of costumes around – ranging from sports wear , full - on mascot outfits and more casual offerings			1
dead rising 3 tries so hard to please , but sadly the gimmicks ca n't hide the paper - thin gameplay			1
mission structure too often involves running from one place to another , bashing some baddies or finding some item of interest , before returning			1
psycho : this fellow is one of the game 's early , human bosses - yet he takes hundreds of bullets to bring down backtracking is a soul - destroying affair , and it plagues @entity7			1
boss battles , too – although the foes remain as varied as ever – are not particularly enjoyable			1
often involving human foes rather than the undead , it ’s ironic and absurd when watching a boss take 100s of bullets to the face , only to watch them shake it off and carry on			2
it just jars with the rest of the game ... driving too , is n’t as fun as it could be			0
although there ’s a variety of sports cars and motorbikes , the inclusion of these high - performance vehicles is odd , as - given how cramped the roads are – you ’ll never come close to their top speed			1
crash landing : the city may be large in scale , but roads are cramped and cumbersome to meander the driving sections also highlight a more sinister problem … slowdown			0
as impressive the hordes of zombies are , the console does struggle when things get hectic ( and this happens a lot )			2
textures will pop up , items will float in the air for no reason			0
these are problems expected of a launch title , but are nevertheless slightly disheartening			0
still , it ’s a solid entry into the series , even though it ’s largely a case of style over substance			0
@entity7 is an @entity15 exclusive			1
it is released on friday			0
follow us on @entity155 : @ @entity156 and on @entity157 : @entity158 .			0

*staggering* number of zombies on - *screen* shows off the @entity15 's power
hundreds of weapons and vehicles to use , plus plenty of *customisation*
gameplay wears thin after a while - especially mission structure
boring lead character and *script*
boss battles grate
