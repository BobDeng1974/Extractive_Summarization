@entity3 , 50 , had been banned from contacting @entity12 newsreader @entity2 in december 2007 after bombarding her with emails , but had applied to have the ban lifted at @entity16			1
instead judges imposed a stricter ban on @entity3 which prevents him using social media sites to contact her			1
@entity3 told the court he only started contacting @entity2 , 39 , when he received ' numerous anonymous prank phone calls ' after appearing on @entity6 's @entity5 quiz show in 2004			1
he believed they were from the blonde presenter and then repeatedly emailed her for three years until she obtained an indefinite restraining order			2
@entity3 , of @entity27 , said : ' as what i was receiving was anonymous , what i gave back was sometimes anonymous			1
' when the original harassment case was brought against me i pleaded guilty because i was sorry that i had upset her			0
' he told the court that the ban was causing him problems explaining : ' i want to go to @entity38 to visit my cousin , but with the restraining order being against a celebrity , and connected to the @entity12 , i do n't think the @entity38 authorities would look at me in a kind light			1
' i believe that my passport has some kind of marker on it - i go to see my mum and dad in @entity50 from @entity51 and my car always gets searched			0
' i know that i will still have a criminal record but this restraining order is known to police as an ' active court order ' and seems to mean they stop me more			0
' i feel like the order is a @entity58 hanging over me			0
' @entity2 - who became a presenter on @entity60 in 2005 - prepared a victim impact statement saying that she wanted the order kept in place , because it was clearly working			2
host : @entity2 pictured presenting @entity5 prosecutor @entity66 said : ' she believes the order hanging over him prevents him from contacting her because of the serious repercussions			1
' the " @entity58 " , as @entity3 calls it , prevents him from making further contact with her			2
' she makes the point that if this order was removed it would involve significant unpleasant and difficult security arrangements having to be put in place			0
' mr @entity66 said the original order - imposed in december 2007 - was ' antiquated '			0
he asked magistrates to reimpose the restraining order but update it to include social media like @entity11 and @entity10			2
magistrates agreed and imposed the updated order indefinitely			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity3 , 50 , of @entity27 , had appealed against an order barring him from contacting @entity12 newsreader @entity2
he had harassed the former presenter of @entity6 's @entity5 quiz show after he appeared on the programme in 2004
now his ban has been extended to include contacting the presenter through social *networking* sites
