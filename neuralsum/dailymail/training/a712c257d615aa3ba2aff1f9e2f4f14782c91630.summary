by @entity0 tasers are being used by police against children as young as 11 almost every day , figures have revealed			1
armed officers discharged , targeted or threatened to use the 50,000 - volt weapons against youngsters more than 320 times a year – an 11-fold increase from the first year they were cleared for use against under - 18s in 2007			1
it emerged earlier this year that a girl aged just 12 had been shot by police with a taser device in @entity15			0
other children aged 11 have been threatened by officers with the weapons , forced have admitted			1
widespread : in 2011 @entity2 were used 323 times against under - 18s critics pointed out that the revelations about the controversial of @entity2 by the police come at a bad time for forces – just as they are ‘ in the dock ’ over their conduct in the @entity26 scandal			1
in the first year of officers being cleared to taser children , they were used just 29 times in @entity31			2
by 2009 , this total had increased to 135			0
new figures released to @entity34 show that one year later , in 2010 , the weapons were used 339 times against children			1
by 2011 – the latest year that figures are available , the total stood at 323			1
the figures were not broken down into whether the guns were fired , or whether officers targeted children with a red dot laser to threaten them			1
@entity45 , solicitor - advocate specialising in taser - related injuries and director of @entity48 , said she was appalled by the findings – and called for the use of @entity2 on children to be prohibited			1
‘ it is shocking that @entity2 have been used on under 18s nearly once a day for the last two years , ’ she said			1
‘ tasers should only be used on children and young adults if there is no other feasible way to restrain them due to the specific health risks they could suffer			2
if the @entity62 is fired at their chest there is a higher risk they will suffer a cardiac arrest			2
‘ the statistics show that the @entity62 is being used in contravention of the @entity70 , due to the dramatic increase in their use on under 18 ’s			2
this needs to be addressed by the police forces immediately before there is a serious injury caused to a child or young adults			0
’ shocking : the weapons use 50,000 volts of electricity to stun people whom the police need to restrain @entity84 , chief executive of the @entity85 think tank , said : ‘ it seems there is a risk of misuse of @entity2 , that the police will use them as an on - the - spot punishment			1
‘ these figures come at a time when the police is in the dock over perceived untrustworthiness			2
’ in one of the most shocking cases , @entity97 shot a 12 - year - old girl in @entity15 as she brandished two knives and threatened to harm herself			1
at the time a spokesman said : ‘ @entity62 was deployed as a means to safely detain the girl and prevent serious harm to both her , the public and the officers			0
‘ the girl was uninjured and was subsequently arrested and cautioned for the offence			0
’ freedom of information requests have revealed that over the past three years , at least six children aged only 14 have been shot with @entity2 , four ages 15 and 13 aged 16			1
children as young as 11 have been threatened			1
the latest figures , released following a parliamentary question asked by @entity115 backbencher @entity114 , did not break down the 2011 figures into the way the stun guns were deployed			1
but figures for 2009/10 , released last year , show that of the 114 usages against children , 31 had been shot with @entity2 – where an officer pulls the trigger shooting out a pointed barb attached by a wire to deliver an electric shock			1
another 74 were ‘ red dotted ’ - a threatening gesture by officers pointing the taser at the child pinpointing exactly where the barbs will hit their body with a red ‘ sniper ’s ’ dot			1
' @entity136 ' : @entity115 mp @entity114 said the statistics uncovered were ' alarming ' experts say even deploying the red dot is still very threatening and can constitute assault			0
on 18 occasions the @entity62 was ‘ drawn ’ by police as a show of force , while in nine cases the ‘ drive stun mode ’ was used to stun a suspect			2
only specialist officers can use tasers at present , but last year the @entity150 called for every officer to be armed with one			0
there are 12,000 tasers on the streets			0
official guidance from the @entity156 states that ‘ children and adults of smaller stature as being at potentially greater risk from the cardiac effects of @entity62 currents than normal adults of average or large stature ’			2
the 2008 document added : ‘ until more research is undertaken to clarify the vulnerability of children to @entity62 currents , children and persons of small stature should be considered at possible greater risk than adults			0
’ last night @entity114 , the @entity115 mp who uncovered the statistics , said : ‘ it is very alarming that hundreds of children are having tasers used against them every year			0
‘ whilst of course they do have a role , the @entity179 should have a better grip on exactly when they are being used			0
‘ it ’s alarming how many children are being targeted			0
it seems that , step by step , we are moving closer to a militarised police force rather than a civilian police force			0
’ last year police were accused last night of behaving like ‘ thugs with weapons ’ after firing a 50,000 - volt @entity62 into the back of a blind man			2
an officer mistook stroke victim @entity198 ’s white stick for a samurai sword and discharged the stun gun – leaving the retired architect writhing in agony on the ground			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity179 said : ‘ the @entity179 and the police have rigorously tested taser and independent medical assessments have concluded that the risk of serious or life threatening injuries is low			0
‘ they are only used by officers who have been carefully selected and trained and in situations where there is a serious threat of violence			0
‘ @entity62 provides the police with an additional tactical option that is less - lethal than conventional firearms and there have been no reported serious injuries or deaths in the @entity223 directly linked to their use			0

new figures have been released under freedom of information laws
they show that 323 under - 18s were fired on in 2011
it was also revealed that in 2010 , 74 children were threatened by having the @entity2 *'s* sights trained on them without firing the weapon
