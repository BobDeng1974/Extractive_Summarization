as video games were in their infancy , most people were thrilled with the heavily pixelated graphics , but never got to see ' @entity13 ' - the setting of @entity15 from the original @entity17 game released in 1991 - from the speedy hedgehog 's point of view			1
however , a stomach - churning video now lets nostalgic gamers see the game as they never have before as they race along and dodge obstacles as @entity1			2
@entity1 made his first major appearance in the now - iconic game , @entity17 , for the @entity27 where he ran through @entity29 levels to try and save the ' world ' from his nemesis , dr. @entity31			2
the character is a blue 15 - year - old anthropomorphic hedgehog , who has the ability to run at supersonic speeds as well as curl into a ball , primarily to attack enemies			0
throughout the course of the many video games , @entity1 most commonly has to race through levels , collect power up rings and survive against a host of natural obstacles and robotic evil minions to achieve his goal			2
the video by @entity50 , a gaming news channel on @entity52 , takes gamers on a familiar journey through the first mini level that they have probably played many times but with a new viewpoint			0
while fans of the platform game might risk motion sickness watching the video , they can avoid vicious robots and dodge sharp - toothed jumping fish , while riding out the bumps and clambering over the rocks that litter the course in the first mini level - all through the eyes of the spiny blue mammal			1

and that 's before the soul - destroying moment familiar to many children of the nineties when the hapless hedgehog loses all the rings just before completing the stage			0
however , a stomach - churning video now lets nostalgic gamers see the first @entity1 game as they never have before as they race along and dodge obstacles as ' the blue blur '			1
a slightly later game title is pictured while fans of the ' the blue blur ' will have played games on later consoles where they follow the hedgehog or share @entity1 's viewpoint , this is the first time gamers have got a hog 's - eye - view on the very first major game he was featured in			1
@entity1 was a huge gaming icon of the nineties and featured in numerous spin - off comics , four animated shows as well as on countless pieces of merchandise			0
