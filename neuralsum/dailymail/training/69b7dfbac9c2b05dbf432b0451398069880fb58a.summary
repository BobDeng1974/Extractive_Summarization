@entity0 is set to introduce ' no jab , no play ' legislation to ban unvaccinated children from attending childcare centres			1
the policy was successfully introduced in @entity7 in 2014 and @entity0 's participation signals a progression in the nationwide effort to crack down on parents that reject vaccination			1
the state government have begun preparations and the legislation could potentially be finalised by as soon as early 2016 , according to health minister @entity17			1
according to the laws , preschools and day care centres have the right to prohibit children from attending if they have not been vaccinated			1
parents who are conscientious objectors can only enrol their child if they have permission from a medical practitioner , who has given the parents counselling and made the parents aware of the inherent risk of failing to vaccinate their child			1
children who are proven to be unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons are also exempt from the ' no jab , no play ' laws			1
it has also been announced that whooping cough vaccines will be made free to all @entity0 expectant parents once again , the state government says			1
children who are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons are exempt from the ' no jab , no play ' laws disease rates have jumped by more than 50 per cent in the last year with children under one the most affected by the increased rates			1
premier @entity64 met with new parents at @entity67 's @entity66 on sunday to announce the program which will provide free vaccines for women in their third trimester and parents of babies up to six months old			1
' parents will get the free whooping cough shots to protect them from giving to their children , unknowingly , what can be a deadly virus , ' he told reporters			1
' this will save lives			2
' a tender process will be carried out to source the vaccine , which is currently in a worldwide shortage			0
health minister @entity17 said more than 80,000 @entity85 would be vaccinated under the program			1
it has also been announced that whooping cough vaccines will be made free to all @entity0 expectant parents once again the program had previously been in place but was removed by the @entity93 government in 2012			1
it will cost the government $ 8.4 million over four years and will be paid for through the scrapping of the @entity96 and @entity97			1
earlier this week , pro-vaccination campaigners took to social media to express their outrage over an anti-immunisation advocate 's plans to come to @entity34 shores			0
@entity104 , who has written books such as saying no to @entity106 and @entity107 and flu vaccines : what 's coming through that needle ? , will be touring in @entity67 , @entity111 , @entity112 , the @entity113 and @entity114 in february and march			0
the seminars are called @entity116 , and @entity117			0
@entity104 , who has written books such as saying no to @entity106 and @entity107 and flu vaccines : what 's coming through that needle ? , will be touring @entity121 in february and march people will also get the chance to sit down and have dinner with the high - profile anti-vaccination campaigner , with tickets ranging from $ 125 to $ 200			2
on her website , dr @entity104 writes she believes ' vaccines can cause more harm to the health of the individual ' and is against ' a system that forces parents to inject their children , against their better judgment '			1
her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the t - shirts sold on her site , which read : ' i did n't deny my children vaccines ... i spared them ' and ' fact : 1 in 50 = @entity145 , fact : 1 in 25,000 = unvaccinated , @entity143 '			1
but dr @entity104 's visit have people so outraged they have vowed to write to local politicians to stop her from spreading her message , with @entity150 the @entity151 - a group who are for vaccines - leading the charge			0
the seminars are called raising @entity155 , and will be held in @entity156 , @entity7 , @entity121 and @entity0 her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the t - shirts sold on her site stop the @entity151 's @entity158 told @entity159 the group 's concern was dr @entity104 ' peddled misinformation '			1
' she 's giving information that 's not supported by evidence and marketing it to people with alternative views and possibly leaving them in danger by not vaccinating their young children , ' he said			2
dr @entity158 - who has a phd in hiv research - said it was also concerning that people who were joining dr @entity104 , like @entity173 , were spruiking homeopathic vaccines , which are ' essentially water '			0
' the evidence shows they do n't work â€¦ and leaves their kids susceptible , ' dr @entity158 said			2
' recently a seven - month - old child who was not vaccinated died from whooping cough			1
' one of @entity150 the @entity151 's supporters wrote on social media she was going to write to federal politicians asking for their intervention			0
' i 'm writing to the @entity189 @entity188 and @entity190 ( health minister and assistant health minister )			0
vaccines are recommended by every state body in @entity121			0
they are incentivised by our federal govt , ' one woman said on @entity199			0
people have taken to social media to express their outrage , with one pro-vaccine group starting a letter writing campaign some have even taken to the @entity199 pages of venues slamming them for holding the events while others have expressed their disgust on the social media pages of the venues holding the seminars			0
' i am beyond disgusted that you are hosting an anti vaccination seminar in march ... children die each year in this country as a result of this misinformation , is the small amount of money you are going to get ... worth it ? ' a @entity199 user wrote on @entity67 's @entity225			2
another wrote : ' can not believe you are hosting an anti vaccine seminar in march , disgusting			0
never staying here , ever			0
' this comes after the @entity231 ruled against @entity232 , finding homeopathic vaccines were not scientifically proven to be effective , and said the health website had mislead people into thinking they could be used as a substitute for medical vaccines , @entity229 reported			0
@entity238 of @entity239 and surveillance director @entity240 told @entity159 dr @entity104 was tapping into people 's ' fear factor '			0
' when we 've got no disease to see , it 's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it 's something we still do n't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated			2
you can understand why people would believe that , ' he said			0
' but there are hundreds of studies that disprove that			0
' professor @entity257 added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases			2
he said it was like asking someone if they wanted to be vaccinated with ' sterile water '			2
' it 's just laughable really , ' professor @entity257 said .			0
