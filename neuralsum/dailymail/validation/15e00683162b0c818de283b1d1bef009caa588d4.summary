@entity0 : the seven lives of @entity2 by @entity3 @entity2 is a great name from our past , yet a vague one			1
an economic guru between the wars whose radical ideas helped to end the @entity12 and who then fought the @entity14 for us in the harsh , ungrateful bargaining after the end of @entity18 about who should pay for it			1
@entity2 ( right ) with his @entity22 ballerina wife , @entity21 ( left ) no one but economists read @entity2 ’ books and the controversies they created — because nobody but economists can bear to read about such ‘ a technical and difficult subject ’ , as he called it himself			1
daringly but sensibly , this renowned biographer , @entity3 , has studied @entity2 from seven points of view — not one of them as an economist			1
there is so much more left to say about him with this left out			2
he was a man who simply simmered with alpha qualities , and could have done just about anything			2
he settled for being a great economist , a pillar of @entity44 , a distinguished higher civil servant , a successful market speculator , a popular writer and journalist , a dealer in modern art who helped to restock the @entity52 , a theatre impresario who provided @entity54 with its @entity55 , a restorer of @entity57 to ballet from a wartime dance hall			2
oh , and he farmed on his estate in @entity60			2
presiding over his versatility was @entity2 ’ amazing mind			1
to quote no lesser an authority than @entity65 : ‘ @entity2 ’ intellect was the sharpest and clearest i have ever known			1
@entity69 argument darted out of him with the swiftness of an adder ’s tongue			2
’ for recreation away from all this cerebral activity , @entity2 was an active and unapologetic homosexual for his younger years			1
then he converted spectacularly to become the devoted husband of a glamorous @entity22 ballerina			1
he did n’t disapprove of making money , but he saw it as something to spend			0
money spent oiled the capitalist system ; hoarding it gummed up the works and caused recurring crises			0
on himself : ‘ i have a clever head , a weak character , an affectionate disposition and a repulsive appearance			0
i am so physically repulsive that i ’ve no business to hurl my body on anyone else ’s			0
’ but he did — and some of the most surprising pages of this book are devoted to @entity2 the lover and sexual cruiser on the pick - up			1
you would not have guessed it , because the cover - up was so careful , but the @entity103 ’ @entity102 years was a hotbed of sexuality of the most refined kind			2
a secret society called @entity108 ( of self - elected alpha minds ) held meetings at which they prided themselves on learned papers rejecting conventional moral values			0
‘ we are the @entity114 , ’ said @entity2			1
@entity2 ' ( pictured ) radical ideas helped end the @entity12 and he then fought the @entity14 at the end of @entity18 about who should pay for it returning after two years ’ absence , he commented , excitedly : ‘ the thing has come on by leaps and bounds to the point where practically everybody in @entity54 is an open and avowed @entity124 ! ’ the apostles were responsible for distinguishing between the @entity127 and the @entity128			1
of the higher kind , to which they aspired , the feelings of the lovers were so intense that they precluded any physical carryings - on			0
@entity2 entered into ‘ love ’ triangles with such @entity136 names as @entity137 and his brother			1
the spectacle of two men who both hated their appearances equally — @entity137 was tall , ungainly , with a tuft of red beard , glasses and a shrill voice , matched by @entity2 , whom @entity147 described as ‘ a gorged seal , double chin , ledge of red lip , little eyes , central , brutal , unimaginative ’ — well , it is hardly appetising			1
@entity2 ’ encounters in @entity54 were all discreet and confined within the colleges , but he took rooms in @entity136 for adventurous sallies on the streets			1
he kept accounts of his pick - ups			0
there was none of the @entity163 here			0
they would read : ‘ stable boy of @entity167 , @entity168 of the @entity52 , the soldier of the @entity170 , the young @entity14 near the @entity171			0
’ also listed were the clergyman , the @entity173 , the @entity174 nobleman of the @entity170 , the @entity175 of the @entity176			0
no names , you ’ll notice			0
anonymity was part of the attraction of the pick - up			0
the other thing missing from his notes is any kind of guilt			0
@entity2 enjoyed his hazardous sex life			1
he compiled statistics of his encounters , which averaged about 60 a year , with obvious satisfaction , as if they were cricket scores			0
they came to an end when he fell seriously in love with @entity195 , the painter of the @entity136 who had long been the lover of @entity137			2
@entity137 let out a hyena scream of pain when he found out			0
with his brother , @entity199 , he set about demolishing @entity2 ’ reputation			1
strangely enough , it was @entity2 ’ love for @entity195 , who then had a love affair with @entity147 ’s sister , @entity205 , that changed him in the same direction			1
he started paying court to @entity21 , who had arrived in @entity209 as a star of the @entity212 ’s @entity211			1
it was three years before they got together at a country house party and were swiftly married with @entity195 as best man			2
@entity2 never slept with a man again			1
his wife , known as @entity219 to his friends , proved an ideal companion — intuitive instead of intellectual , slightly dotty , full of unexpected charm and pranks			0
she looked after @entity2 , who began showing symptoms of a weak heart			1
although @entity2 was an active and unapologetic homosexual during his younger years , he never slept with a man again after he married ballerina , @entity21 he overworked at the @entity228 throughout @entity18 , but his great contributions were still to come as it ended			1
the first problem was the chaos of world trade now that it was dominated completely by a reinvigorated @entity14			0
this was averted by setting up the @entity236 trade agreement , a @entity237 and an @entity238 — all @entity2 ’ ideas			1
it took the @entity14 some little time to appreciate that , in @entity2 , they were not dealing with another @entity243 grandee , like his fellow negotiator lord @entity245 , but with the fastest brain in the @entity248			1
@entity2 knew that @entity249 was broke , having sold our assets and cleaned out our reserves to survive the war			2
the welfare plans of the @entity256 government were at stake if the @entity14 did n’t provide the finance			0
there was no @entity14 inclination to go easy on their ally , who had held the fort against @entity265			0
they still saw @entity249 as the hated imperial power they had rebelled against in 1776			0
so no cancellation of our debts was forthcoming			0
at last , the loan that @entity2 was working for would be granted — but at interest of 2 per cent for the rest of the century , which is what it took us to pay it off			2
worn out by meetings and speeches , @entity2 limped home to @entity243 with @entity219 on the @entity282 , only to die in her arms at their country house a few weeks later			2
his last services to his country were made			0
seven views of a man do not always add up neatly			0
much as one must admire @entity2 , there lingers a suspicion that he was , with reason , very arrogant and impatient with inferiors , never really at home either with his club men in @entity294 or disreputable @entity136 circle			2
nevertheless , a rewarding and fascinating book .			0
