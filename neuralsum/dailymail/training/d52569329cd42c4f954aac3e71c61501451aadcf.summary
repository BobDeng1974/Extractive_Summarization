@entity1 fans were promised cheaper access to the show by @entity4 but the hit drama is not included in the new subscription deal to win over more customers and reduce illegal downloads			1
connecting to pay tv network now starts at $ 25 per month , which includes more than 40 channels			0
however - there is an additional cost to gain access to sports , dramas and movies			1
the subscription giant has also set up a new channel , @entity20 , which screens entire seasons , back - to - back , of some of the most popular tv series including the blockbuster			0
previously it would have cost viewers a minimum of $ 74 to access the series			2
however , considering @entity43 set a world record for file sharing downloads - with more than one million accessing the show last season - the question begs is the reduced subscription enough to stop fans from illegally downloading ? according to file sharing monitor @entity50 , @entity43 is the only country in the world to reach double digit downloads of the show with 11.6 per cent of @entity1 downloads originating here			1
despite the show being a massive success - @entity4 only managed to hit the 115,000 - 175,000 viewers range - technically fewer viewers than for @entity59 on sunday mornings			0
making @entity1 cheaper to watch is not the sole reason behind @entity4 's revised pricing structure but it is the reference point for comparing the old subscription scale to the new one			2
@entity4 ceo @entity65 said there has already been a positive response to their new pay structure			0
there will also be more hd channels and the launch of an upgraded iq box to allow viewers to watch shows that have been screened in the previous 24 hours			0
more than one million @entity43 downloaded the last season of @entity1 - more than any other country			1

@entity4 promised @entity1 fans cheaper access to the show
but the reduced monthly subscription of $ 25 does *n't* include the drama
additional $ 20 *fee* is charged to gain access to sports , dramas and movies
previously it cost fans a minimum of $ 74 to access the series on @entity4
more than one million @entity43 downloaded the last season of @entity1
the only country in the world to reach those massive figures
