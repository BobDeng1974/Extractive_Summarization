the use of @entity3 spy cars that issue parking fines will be severely restricted to stop their widespread abuse , the road safety minister has promised			1
@entity7 said profits from parking penalties had more than doubled from £ 223million to £ 512million between 1998 and 2011 – and are expected to rise to £ 635million in 2014			0
during that time many councils have started using mobile @entity3 spy cars in addition to traditional parking wardens			2
money spinners : road safety minister @entity7 said a recent @entity15 revealed some councils have been using cctv cars for parking enforcement as ' a matter of routine ' there was now a ‘ deeply rooted public perception ’ that local authorities view parking enforcement as a cash cow to boost their coffers mr @entity7 warned			2
@entity3 would in future be limited to areas around schools , in bus lanes , at bus stops and on red ‘ no stop ’ routes , he said			1
speaking at the annual @entity34 exhibition in @entity35 , mr @entity7 said a recent @entity15 revealed some councils have been using @entity3 for parking enforcement as ‘ a matter of routine ’			1
he said : ‘ that is not acceptable			0
the surveillance camera code of practice has long been clear that @entity3 should be used sparingly and only where other means of enforcement are unpractical			2
‘ what is essential is that the public have confidence that where @entity3 is being used it is to promote safety and to tackle congestion			2
’ mr @entity7 said his aim was to put an end to practices that ‘ offend a sense of natural justice ’			1
' offence to a sense of natural justice ' : @entity7 said profits from parking penalties had more than doubled between 1998 and 2011 above all there must be fair enforcement , he said : ‘ the use of @entity3 , in particular , causes public concern			1
but so does the perception that enforcement officers are waiting to pounce the moment the meter runs out			0
‘ motorists should not be fearful about returning to their vehicles a few minutes late			1
indeed , in most cases , drivers return with unexpired time left and the council can then re-sell the space and , in effect , be paid double			0
’ mr @entity7 noted how the @entity15 had concluded that the current appeals system disadvantaged people who had ‘ inadvertently make a mistake			0
’ he added : ‘ their sense was that the current system discourages people from appealing their tickets			2
‘ people who have a legitimate reason not to pay are simply giving up and paying the fine			0
that offends a sense of natural justice			1
’ mr @entity7 said he wanted to give parking bosses ‘ a flavour of our thinking ’ ahead of announcing new rules soon in a new shake - up			0
but the @entity95 yesterday warned the abuse of @entity3 could continue if it was only curtailed rather than banned			0
@entity95 president @entity97 said : ‘ motorists will still have concerns about @entity3 cars , even if their use is curtailed			1
‘ but we welcome a decent grace period to protect drivers who otherwise get unfairly fined if their watch is two minutes out of synch with the town hall clock			0

@entity3 will be limited to schools , bus lanes , bus stops and red routes
aim is to put an end to practices that ‘ offend a sense of natural justice ’
' motorists should not be fearful of returning to a few minutes late '
