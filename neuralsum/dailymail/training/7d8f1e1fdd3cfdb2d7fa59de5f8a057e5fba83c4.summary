can you make a name for yourself ? can you be a hero ? can you go down in this club ’s history as the team that beat @entity9 in the cup final ? ‘ that ’s what i ’ll be challenging them to do , and we will have a plan of action to try and beat @entity9			2
just look at last season			2
@entity53 ’s players will be remembered forever as @entity12 winners , and that has to be the spur for us			2
’ @entity2 will continue talks over a new contract after the final and also plans negotiations with @entity61 over a possible £ 7million move for on - loan midfielder @entity63			1

@entity76 performer : @entity64 has been in superb form for @entity6 this season in the league and cup wonder strike : the midfielder 's glorious goal against @entity84 helped secure @entity6 's final spot ‘ the message was , the day has gone before you know it , unless you take your chances , so we intend making the most of it			1
occasions like this do n’t come around often , so grab it with both hands			0
it would genuinely be a dream come true for us all			0
