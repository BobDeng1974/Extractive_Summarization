a @entity1 woman who was turned down for a job by @entity3 after she showed up for an interview wearing a black headscarf is having her employment discrimination claim considered by the @entity7			1
@entity8 was 17 when she interviewed for a ' model ' position , as the company calls its sales staff , at an @entity13 in a shopping mall in @entity15 , @entity16 , in 2008			1
she never explicitly voiced her religious views or her need to wear a headscarf but the assistant store manager correctly assumed she was a @entity1			0
she impressed the assistant store manager , who then consulted a manager and explained that she thought @entity8 wore the scarf for religious reasons - but the manager said the headscarf was n't permitted even if it was worn because of @entity8 's religion , according to the suit			1
@entity3 has said it did n't violate the law because it never got ' direct , explicit notice ' from @entity8 that her practice conflicted with the company 's policy			1
at the time of the interview , the policy required employees to dress in a way that 's consistent with the clothing @entity3 sells , and it prohibited wearing headscarves or anything in black			1
the company has said it changed its headscarf policy as early as 2010 , but the ban on black clothing remains			2
the federal @entity38 filed suit on @entity8 's behalf , and a jury eventually awarded her $ 20,000			0
but the federal appeals court in @entity73 threw out the award and concluded that @entity3 could not be held liable because @entity8 never asked the company to relax its policy against headscarves			2
' discrimination ' : @entity8 now works in merchandising for @entity80 and has a fashion blog fighting back : the company said @entity8 never asked them to relax its policy in line with her religious practice ' [ a ] n applicant or employee can not remain silent before the employer regarding the religious nature of his or her conflicting practice and need for an accommodation and still hope to prevail in a religion - accommodation case , ' @entity3 wrote in a brief			1
' @entity3 expends a great deal of effort to ensure that its target customers receive a holistically brand - based , sensory experience			0
to @entity3 , a model who violates the look policy by wearing inconsistent clothing inaccurately represents the brand , causes consumer confusion , fails to perform an essential function of the position , and ultimately damages the brand			2
' @entity8 now works for @entity80 and also runs a fashion blog			0
the case being argued wednesday explores when an employer must take steps to accommodate the religious beliefs of a worker or job applicant			0

the @entity7 is now considering her employment discrimination claim @entity1 , @entity126 and @entity128 advocacy organizations have weighed in on @entity8 's side , as have gay - rights groups			1

@entity8 arrived for an interview for a ' model ' position at an @entity149 in @entity15 , @entity16 in 2008 wearing a black headscarf
