by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 26 july 2012 a burlesque dancer who says she was ' banned ' from collecting cash for the @entity3 because of her ' inappropriate ' costume says she is outraged by the decision			1
@entity6 , 47 , who has raised money for the charity for the last 20 years , usually wears a military - style burlesque costume to gather donations in the town of @entity12 , @entity13			1
but the dance teacher has now apparently been told to ditch the outfit in favour of a conservative look more in keeping with the upmarket town			2
@entity6 who has collected for the poppy appeal for 20 years in @entity12 , @entity13 , has been banned because of her ' inappropriate ' outfit the mother - of - three decided to raise her profile in 2010 by wearing the outfit for collections , but the local branch of the @entity3 has held a vote which decided her choice of clothing was ' inappropriate '			1
@entity29 , who performs as a dancer under the name of her alter ego ' @entity33 ' , said she was shocked by the decision			0
she said : ' i ’m fuming , this really has upset me			0
the mother - of - three , who performs under the stage name of ' @entity33 ' , said she was upset by the decision ' i ’ve no idea why it ’s happened , someone should have had the guts to talk to me about it and invite me to discuss the issue with them			2
' @entity6 says collecting money in the unusual attire has enabled her to raise hundreds of pounds since 2010 the 47 - year - old runs a local dancer troupe called the ‘ @entity48 ’ and says her burlesque outfit had helped to make her collections ' successful '			1
however , following the vote by local @entity3 members which saw 28 of the 30 members deem the unusual choice of clothing ' inappropriate ' , the future of her money - raising in the outfit looked to be in doubt			2
but fortunately for @entity60 , the main body of the charity has now stepped in			0
a spokesperson for the @entity3 has maintained that the mother - of - three will , in fact , be allowed to continue to wear her outfit when making collections			1
the spokesman said : ' the @entity3 is delighted to reassure mrs @entity6 that she is not ' banned ' from collecting for the @entity68			1
the decision of organisers in @entity12 has no validity and mrs @entity6 is absolutely welcome to collect for the welfare of our proud @entity73 wherever , whenever , and in whatever outfits she pleases			1
' we are confident that her cheeky and artistic burlesque costumes , in particular ' @entity33 ' , will bring a smile to the faces of the public as they donate generously to the care and support of our @entity73 family , in the certain knowledge that the @entity68 supported by people up and down the @entity86 representing all walks of life – burlesque performers most definitely included			2
' we apologise to mrs @entity6 for any upset that may have been caused and look forward to seeing her collecting on the streets of @entity12 come november			1
' @entity29 , whose family were in the armed forces , has backed her unusual selling technique and said it was not intended to offend anyone			0
she said : ' my grandfather was a professional @entity99 actor and a @entity101 officer			0
' he used to keep the spirits of his troops high with entertainers so what i ’m doing is respecting what he used to do , i ’m not making fun of anyone			0
' i think it takes a lot of guts to dress like that and i ’ve only ever had praise for it			0
' it ’s successful because it ’s so unique , it ’s so different and people want to donate more because they can see you ’ve made an effort			0
' mr @entity121 , the @entity68 organiser for @entity12 , declined to comment on the matter but said : ' all i ’m worried about is getting the poppies out there			2
' @entity12 is quite an ageing population with many retiring military people			0

@entity6 , 47 , says her unique outfit has helped her to raise hundreds of pounds for charity since she started wearing it for collections in 2010
the mother - of - three was told to ditch the costume after members of the local branch of the @entity3 deemed it ' inappropriate '
47 - year - old says she has only ever received praise and words of support from the public for collecting in the outfit in @entity12 , @entity13
but @entity3 have now *overridden* local branch decision and say mrs @entity6 will be allowed to continue to wear her outfit
