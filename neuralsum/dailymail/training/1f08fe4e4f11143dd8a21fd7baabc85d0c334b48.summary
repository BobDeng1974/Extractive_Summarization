the @entity2 is ‘ not fit for the future ’ and unless it undergoes radical change it may be forced to abandon free healthcare for all , in the future , the service 's top doctor has warned			1
medical director of @entity9 professor sir @entity8 said the @entity2 must become far less reliant on hospitals and needed a ‘ complete transformation ’ of the way it operates			1
sir @entity8 told the @entity15 : ‘ if the @entity2 continues to function as it does now , it ’s going to really struggle to cope because the model of delivery and service that we have at the moment is not fit for the future			1
’ gp surgeries need to be given more resources to cope with the pressures of demand and tight budgets , he added			1
he said it needs to move away from a reliance on hospitals and that @entity35 must be given extra resources to cope with demand in order for the @entity2 to keep itself sustainable , he said more services need to happen under the same roof – for example diagnostics tests and an expanded range of treatments at their gp surgery			1
sir @entity8 added : ‘ if not , we will get to a place where the @entity2 becomes unaffordable and we will have to make some very difficult decisions which will get to the very heart of the principle of the @entity2 and its values			1
‘ this will open up a whole series of discussions about whether the @entity2 is fit for purpose , whether it ’s affordable , and whether the compact with the citizen of free healthcare for all is sustainable in the longer term			2
’ he added : ‘ too many patients find the @entity2 fragmented ( and ) confusing			2
they find that they get pushed from pillar to post ; they feel like a ball in a pinball machine at times			0
’ he denied claims that ambulance services , @entity65 and gp surgeries are struggling to cope and are in crisis – despite waiting times at @entity65 being at their worst levels in a decade			1
three of the 10 ambulance trusts in @entity9 have had to declare a critical alert over the winter			2
but sir @entity8 denied it was a crisis			1
he said : ‘ everybody that ’s working out there in the @entity2 knows that they ’re under a lot of pressure at the moment			0
' they do n’t like the term " crisis " being applied willy - nilly			0
@entity86 's top doctor said despite the intense pressures on @entity65 departments and ambulance services across the @entity86 , the @entity2 is not in crisis			0
he said : ' the word " crisis " implies that you ca n't deal with it ' ‘ it ’s an evocative term which is also provocative and is used too freely for the wrong reasons			0
' it ’s a period of unprecedented pressure , of undue pressure			0
but the @entity2 is facing very difficult times , yes			0
the word " crisis " implies that you ca n’t deal with it			0
’ he added that the frontline services ‘ are going through a critical phase ’ but would recover			0
a @entity106 spokesman said : ‘ in common with healthcare systems around the world , the @entity2 is facing unprecedented demand , but undermining the principle of services being free at the point of use is not the answer			2
' instead , we are backing the @entity2 ’s plan for the future and have provided an extra £ 2bn in funding next year to transform out - of - hospital care and meet the needs of an ageing population			2

sir @entity8 , medical director of @entity9 said the health service needs a ' complete transformation ' to make it less reliant on hospitals
@entity127 surgeries need more resources to cope with high demand
if changes are not made it ' may be forced to abandon free care for all '
