by @entity0 when @entity1 left her job as an engineer at @entity4 , she did n't want her keen eye for detail to go to waste			1
so the mother - of - two from @entity9 , @entity10 , started experimenting in her kitchen - and ended up crafting spectacular cakes which are out of this world			1
the ultra-realistic creations , which can take days to make , include the likes of muddy trainers , record decks , rusty cars - and even a replica of the @entity21 character @entity22 @entity1 , 41 , pictured left , from @entity9 , @entity10 , handmakes personalised cakes - including this amazing edible copy of the @entity21 character @entity22 , right what a snap ! this realistic - looking @entity28 camera is just one of ms @entity1 's incredible creations , which can each take days to craft and perfect piece of cake ? ms @entity1 started making cakes after leaving her job as an engineer at @entity4 to have her first child - now she makes the amazing cakes full - time the 41 - year - old , who has a masters in engineering , made her first cake - a 3d caterpillar - for fun to celebrate her daughter 's first birthday			1
but after impressing her family and friends with her incredible creation , ms @entity1 now works full - time bringing amazing scenes to life using icing and sponge			0
and ms @entity1 , who outgrew her kitchen and now works from a studio , says her @entity4 background is to thank for the intricate detail which is a trademark of all her cakes			2
she said : ' @entity4 taught me about passion and dedication - i met the most innovative and creative people there who did n't have big budgets or fancy labs but had the dedication and grit to learn and understand			0
' i learned natural problems had natural and graceful solutions			0
cake design is not a dramatic change in my mind it 's just applying the methodology i soaked up from a wonderful institution to another medium			0
' i 'm passionate about problem solving and i adore cakes - completely logical step in my mind			0
' labour of love : ms @entity1 credits her background as a @entity4 engineer for her attention to detail , shown in this rusty car cake , which includes nuts , bolts and a crane incr - edible ! this muddy @entity91 high top boot , complete with twisted laces , is another one of miss @entity1 's amazing edible creations ms @entity1 accidentally fell into cake making after crafting a caterpillar cake for her daughter 's first birthday which proved a hit among family and friends she went on to start making a range of personalised cakes , including this record player , and had to move to a studio when the requests started flooding in is there anything she ca n't do ? this stunning sewing machine cake includes several key details , such as buttons , thread and pins and even tiny , handpainted patterns what a treasure : this edible beauty is overflowing with coins , jewellery and other treasured goods - all of which are made from traditional cake ingredients it 's not what it looks like ! this amazing sushi cake might include wasabi , pickled ginger , chopsticks and even soy sauce , but it is crafted entirely from sponge and icing the mother - of - two says cake design is not a dramatic change from her previous job , as cake - making involves applying the ' same methodology ' that she learned at @entity4 the cakes , which start at around Â£ 250 , include a range of 3d cars which boast the same features found on a real car model nothing is too difficult or time - consuming for ms @entity1 , as this intricate @entity146 game cake - complete with all the @entity146 pieces and their scores - proves ms @entity1 said : ' @entity4 taught me about passion and dedication - i met the most innovative and creative people there who did n't have big budgets or fancy labs but had the dedication and grit to learn and understand ' this light - hearted cake shows a bride being carried among soil in the back of a @entity162			1
ms @entity1 can make cakes for weddings , birthdays or any other special occasion this @entity167 even has a personalised number plate , with intricate wheels , leading and blacked - out windows - one of her many impressive designs it might look fishy ... but luckily this fish basket masterpiece , left , and this apple basket , right taste as sweet as an ordinary cake this muddy @entity178 cake reflect ms @entity1 's passion for cake and intricate ' problem solving ' , with chocolate - flavoured splatters covering the windscreen and wheels			2
