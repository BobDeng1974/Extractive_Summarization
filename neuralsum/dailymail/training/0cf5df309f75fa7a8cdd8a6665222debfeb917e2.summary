@entity0 has come under fire for using the description ' @entity3 ' on its website			1
earlier this morning , the disrespectful costume description could be seen above a selection of plus - size outfits for women , however @entity0 appears to have re-worded it to ' women 's @entity10 ' as of 11:30am			1
a @entity0 representative told @entity12 : ' this never should have been on our site			1
it is unacceptable , and we apologize			2
' @entity26 , @entity27 , a witch and a female vampire were among the costumes in the section			2
despite the offensive label , which presumably was never meant to be seen by the public but rather just by the internal @entity0 team , the models pictured all appear to be a very healthy size			0
mislabeled : despite the offensive category , many of the models pictured , such as the women dressed as a vampire ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) , appear to be an average weight the retailer removed the rude category after it sparked an outcry on social media			1
a firestorm of tweets this morning asked questions such as ' why ? ' and ' how did this happen ? ' ' stay classy @entity0 , ' wrote @entity51 , while @entity52 commented ' ... and that 's how you get fired as a @entity0 web developer			0
' fixed : the section , which also includes witch ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) costumes , was renamed ' women 's @entity10 ' as of 11:30am @entity61 tweeted at @entity0 , ' not sure labeling these as " @entity62 " is the best approach # rude			0
' the company 's official @entity65 account simply replied , ' your comments and suggestions are important to us and help make @entity0 even better			0
' at the time this story was published , a @entity73 search of the term ' @entity0 fat girl costumes ' still brought up the page .			0

the retailer told @entity12 ' this never should have been on our site '
