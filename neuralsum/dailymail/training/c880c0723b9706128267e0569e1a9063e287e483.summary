by @entity0 @entity1 , the @entity2 vice-chairman , has ruled himself out of standing for the @entity5 @entity4 vice-presidency following @entity7 's decision not to run against @entity8			1
@entity9 , the former @entity10 chief executive who is now a @entity11 executive committee member , was the leading candidate for the post but it is understood he has told senior figures at the @entity2 that it is ' very unlikely ' that he will allow his name to be put forward			2
@entity9 's move comes after @entity11 president @entity7 's decision last week not to challenge @entity8 for the @entity4 presidency			1
out of the running : @entity2 vice-chairman @entity1 will not run for @entity5 @entity4 vice-presidency dedicated : the former @entity10 chief executive still regularly attends their matches it is understood that @entity9 , 57 , has also told @entity7 of his intentions to remain at @entity11 but not stand for @entity4 as he does not want to work under @entity8			1
the incumbent president appears virtually assured of winning a fifth term in office with splits among @entity11 counties meaning there is no likelihood of a credible challenger being put forward from the @entity35 confederation			0
@entity9 's decision is a big blow to the @entity2 as he was the outstanding @entity38 candidate for the position , which is to be voted on by @entity11 associations in march and is expected to be contested by @entity42 @entity2 president @entity41 and @entity2 president @entity43			0
@entity9 would have been tempted if @entity7 was in office but is believed to feel that @entity4 executive committee members wield too little decision - making power and often merely rubber - stamp @entity8 's wishes			2
no go : @entity11 president @entity7 has ruled himself out of challenging @entity8 to become @entity4 president candidate : @entity52 is very well - connected in international football circles and is thought to be a candidate the @entity2 will now be under pressure to come up with another candidate , but it would need to be someone with a significant presence			1
one possibility would be sir @entity60 , who has retired from his job as the @entity2 's director of football development			1
@entity60 has profile as a former @entity65 player and experience of administration from his @entity2 role and as a past chairman of @entity65			2
an obvious choice would be former @entity71 and @entity2 vice-chairman @entity52 , who is well - connected in international football circles but the fact he does not have an official @entity2 role currently prevents him from standing			1
stepping down : @entity75 , the current @entity5 @entity4 vice-president ( right ) , has insisted he will step down in may @entity76 's @entity75 , the current @entity5 @entity4 vice-president , is due to step down next may and insists he will not change his mind due to family reasons			0
@entity75 told @entity79 : ' i have made it abundantly clear , despite having been asked by many people to continue , that i will be stepping down			0
' it is up to the @entity5 associations to make sure they send the best candidates they can for the election for this very important position			0
' the vote is due to take place at @entity11 's @entity92 in @entity93 at the end of march .			0

the @entity2 vice-chairman was the leading candidate to *replace* @entity75
