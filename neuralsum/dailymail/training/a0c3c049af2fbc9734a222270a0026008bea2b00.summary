by @entity0 a young girl has been left in tears after being told she can not join friends at their new secondary school - even though she can see it from her bedroom window			2
@entity7 , 11 , of @entity8 , south east @entity9 , was looking forward to the short walk to @entity11 when she starts high school in september			1
but instead her local education authority have given her a place at @entity15 which is over three miles and two bus journeys away			0
@entity7 , 11 , of @entity8 , south east @entity9 , can see the school that refused her entry			1
parents say they will be appealing the ' ridiculous ' decision @entity7 outside the school most of her friends are attending - even though they live further away @entity23 and @entity24 , and their daughter @entity7 , were devastated when she was refused a place at the school just five of her primary school classmates are going to the same school while most of her friends - who all live further away than her - will be going to @entity11 '			1
@entity7 and her angry parents @entity24 , 49 , and @entity23 , 43 , say they have been given no explanation for the decision			1
@entity7 , of @entity35 , south east @entity9 , said : ' i do n't understand , it 's so not fair			2
' it is n't fair that my friends can go to the school next door to my house but i have to go to a school miles away			0
' i do n't understand			0
i just want to go to school with my friends			0
' high school is scary enough without having nobody you know there			0
' @entity24 , a utility supervisor , said : ' @entity23 has lived in this house her entire life , and one of the reasons we 've stayed here is because it was so close to a good school			0
her parents say it will cost an extra £ 800 a year to go to a different school ' for the council to turn round and tell us that @entity7 will have to go to a school miles away from her house is ridiculous ' there 's a perfectly good school around the corner - it 's literally a stone 's throw away			1
' it seems so ridiculous that my daughter can not go to the school she can see from her own window			2
' he added : ' if she was forced to go to @entity15 my partner @entity23 would have to take her for the first year and because she does n't drive the bus would cost about £ 800 for a year			1
@entity7 can see the school that turned her down			2
@entity11 has nine children applying for every place ' @entity23 would also have to give up work in the mornings because she would n't be able to fulfil her duties as a carer in our local area			1
' a @entity11 spokesman said : ' we are very sorry to hear that @entity87 did not receive a place at our school			1
' we know that finding the right school for a child is very important and that this is a stressful time for parents			0
@entity7 has been offered a place at @entity15 , in @entity8 , but she will only be joined by a few of her friends ' we can not comment on individual cases , nor on the admissions policies of other schools in the @entity100 of @entity8			1
' @entity11 is heavily oversubscribed and we are scrupulous in following a fair admissions policy , which is available on our website			0
' the school added that they have nine children applying for every one place			0
the family are appealing against the decision .			0
