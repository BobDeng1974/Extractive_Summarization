' when we realised we 'd could n't have children and get married , it was heart breaking , ' she said			0
' it was devastating to give up one of our dreams			0
we knew that we were n't getting any younger so the best option was to try @entity5 one last time , and sacrifice the wedding			1
' it was a risk , because the @entity5 could have failed - and we 'd have ended up with neither			1
' but when we won the wedding competition , and then found out i was pregnant , it was unbelievable			1
although they had given up on the idea of their perfect wedding the couple were blessed with yet another stroke of luck when they won a wedding contest which allowed them to finally get married before they conceived @entity41 ( right ) and @entity32 ( left ) @entity12 and @entity13 had attempted two rounds of @entity5 ' now i 've got my dream - the perfect husband and children , i could n't be happier			1
' @entity12 and @entity13 , first started ivf treatment in 2012 after a year of failing to conceive naturally			1

but after two failed attempts , @entity12 and @entity13 were forced to make a decision , @entity12 says that it was an incredibly difficult one to make			1
' we were spending all of our money on @entity5 treatment hoping we 'd conceive but after we failed twice i wondered if i 'd ever get pregnant , ' she said			1
' we planned to use the spare money to get married but knew because of our ages we 'd have to have kids now or never			0
' i 'd always dreamt of feeling my baby kick for the first time and the bond after giving birth , so i knew we had to try @entity5 one last time			1
' after winning the wedding competition the couple were able to have the white wedding they had always wanted @entity12 , pictured with @entity41 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) in order to conceive , @entity12 , pictured with @entity41 , had to take three hormone injections a day but she says it was entirely worth it after abandoning hopes of a big celebration the couple decided to at least secure their relationship with a proposal			1
' we were advised to wait for a year before trying again - i was just counting down the days , ' she said			0
' it felt like time was ticking away so quickly			0
at the end of the year , @entity13 and i officially became engaged - it was a way to lift our spirits and we thought if we could n't have a big wedding , we could at least get engaged			1
' but unbeknownst to @entity12 , during their year long wait for @entity5 , @entity13 , who works as an electrician , entered the pair into a win a wedding competition			1
@entity12 says that once again fate was in their favour having initially been runners - up			2
@entity12 says that she and @entity13 could n't stop beaming when they discovered they were expecting twins ' we actually came second in the competition , but then the first place dropped out and so we won , ' she said			1
' we could n't believe it - after all the heart ache and the decision making , we were getting both			0
' it felt like a miracle			0
i 'd always dreamt of a big white wedding and walking down the aisle , but i 'd put that to the back of my mind			2
' i could n't believe my dreams were going to become a reality			0
' after the wedding , the pair changed fertility clinics and had their final round of @entity5			1
it was here that medics discovered @entity12 had low hormone levels and started to treat her for the problem , giving her three hormone injections a day to increase the chance of her falling pregnant when @entity12 first discovered she was pregnant she was so shocked she took four tests to make sure			2
she gave birth to twins @entity41 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) @entity12 says that it was a challenging period but she was prepared to carry on in hope of having her dream family			2
' i felt like a pin cushion while i was having all the treatment but knew it was worth it			0
' then after the eggs were implanted i took two weeks off work to relax and do nothing other than sit with my legs up in the hope it would help us to get pregnant			0
' then we did a pregnancy test and it was positive			0
we did n't want to get our hopes up but after four more tests said we were pregnant i believed it			0
' overjoyed with the news @entity12 was then astounded to find out that she was not carrying just one baby but two			2
' once i knew i was pregnant i had a feeling we were going to have twins and when doctors confirmed it we could n't believe it			0
' when the doctor told me there were two heartbeats we were all gobsmacked			0
the twins were born on 27th september last year @entity12 says that even when the @entity41 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) are screaming she feels lucky to have them ' me and @entity13 sat beaming at each other , we could n't believe we were about to have one baby let alone twins			1
' the twins were born in september last year and six months later the couple still ca n't quite believe their luck			2
@entity12 said : ' it 's amazing to think how dramatically our life changed in one year - we got married and now have a beautiful boy and girl			2
' even now i still feel so privileged to have children - even when they are screaming i keep thinking thank goodness that they are with us			0
' before i thought of myself as very unlucky , i 'd never won anything in my life			2
' but since winning our wedding and having kids it still does n't feel real			0
' i 've definitely used my life 's worth of luck now but i do n't care because i 've got everything i ever dreamed of so i 'm happy			0
