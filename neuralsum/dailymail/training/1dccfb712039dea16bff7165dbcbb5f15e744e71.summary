@entity1 chief national correspondent @entity0 could be ousted from the network in favour of new chief @entity5 correspondent @entity4 , @entity7 can reveal			1
@entity0 , 49 , has already moved out of his office to make way for @entity4 , 43 , who was poached by new @entity1 boss @entity10 from @entity11			1
and now sources have revealed that @entity0 has not signed a new contract - and has instead signed an extension to his existing deal , leaving his future at the network unclear			1
exes : @entity1 chief national correspondent @entity0 with his ex wife , @entity1 's senior congressional correspondent @entity19 at a @entity21 bash in may 2009 popular : @entity1 's new chief @entity5 correspondent @entity4 has already been given his own weekday show @entity4 , who debuted on @entity1 last week , has already been given his own weekday show by @entity10 , most likely set to launch in march or april			1
both @entity4 and @entity0 are uber forces in @entity5 and a source said : ' people are wondering what @entity10 has planned for @entity0			1
his own show did n't work and it was dropped , so where can he go ? what would be the best place for him ? ' @entity0 disappeared from the airwaves and @entity33 for nearly a month between december and january until @entity34 reported he had been on an extended vacation with his family - a post-election break			1
the longtime @entity1 correspondent who hosted ' @entity39 ' until disappointing ratings forced it off the air last summer , signed a short - term contract extension at the end of last year			1
he split from @entity1 's senior congressional correspondent @entity19 , 40 , last march after four years of marriage less than a year after she gave birth to their son @entity46			1
the petite blonde is a favourite at the network			0
@entity4 is now in @entity0 's former office - and the correspondent left him a bottle of @entity53 as a moving in gift			1
a @entity1 source told @entity7 : ' this was purely out of convenience			1
@entity4 's team are going to be based by that office , so it made sense			0
@entity0 has a got a new office , it 's really gorgeous			1
' @entity4 said he expects to take over the 4 p.m. hour currently occupied by @entity64 ’s ‘ @entity63			0
’ @entity64 will be cut back to 5 to 7 p.m. if all goes well , it could be a prelude to @entity4 breaking into the prime - time lineup and he told @entity34 : ' it ’s a little premature , but anything ’s possible			0
@entity10 says he wants to do a lot of different things			2
' everything ’s on the table			0
but maybe 4 p.m. will ultimately be a great place to be			0
it ’s when viewers start getting serious about news			0
it ’s valuable real estate			0
' a @entity1 spokeswoman said : ' we never discuss contracts			2
' this week , @entity10 - who was hired from @entity84 to shake up @entity1 after it suffered its worst rating slump in 21 years last summer - hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job			1
the first departuree was political power couple @entity87 , the veteran political analyst , and his wife @entity90 , who have been with @entity1 since 2005			2
@entity1 network 's managing editor @entity91 then announced that he was going to quit as it emerged @entity4 's former @entity11 colleague @entity94 was coming over to start a new morning show			1
shake - up : @entity1 's new boss @entity10 , pictured left , has hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job			1
however , the former editor of @entity102 's @entity101 , @entity103 , right , will keep his job @entity106 's @entity105 will also be leaving and will reportedly be heading to @entity107 , which recently parted ways with @entity109 , who , according to close sources , declined to sign a new deal with the network			2
but perhaps the biggest news of all is that the voice of @entity115 will once again speak the ' this is @entity1 ' greeting			2
the @entity117 nominee and voice of @entity119 has not been featured on the network for years but @entity10 asked that it be brought back on monday to coincide with president @entity122 's inauguration - also his first day in the job			1
the former editor of @entity102 's @entity101 , @entity103 , will remain in his position as host of @entity126 , which he began hosting on 17 january 2011 , as ratings continue to grow			0
the changes show just how serious @entity10 is about turning @entity1 around , but for so much to happen so soon has raised eyebrows			1
his actions also leave huge questions over others whose fate rests in his hands , namely @entity135 who wants to leave @entity84 for @entity1			2
another who will be feeling anxious is @entity138 , who currently hosts the @entity1 morning show ' @entity140 , ' which has struggled in the ratings despite being critically applauded			2
gone : the first departure was political power couple @entity87 , right , the veteran political analyst , and his wife @entity90 , left , who have been with @entity1 since 2005 co-anchors : @entity94 , left , will reportedly be paired with @entity147 , right , who currently hosts her prime time @entity1 show ' @entity150 ' @entity138 faces being ousted for @entity94 who will reportedly be paired with @entity147 , who currently hosts her prime time @entity1 show ' @entity150			2
' getting @entity94 , the son of @entity153 governor @entity152 , is quite a coup for @entity1 as he is a former anchor on @entity11 's @entity155 and is extremely experienced			2
but @entity138 will now have to renegotiate her role and try to avoid being put on the dreaded ' special assignment ' duty which will see her consigned to graveyard slots and obscurity			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ' @entity163 is very important to the network , and we 're discussing various options with her			1
' @entity168 's firing seems less controversial			0
he claimed that he was ' completely cool ' with being axed and that it was to do with the fact he lives in @entity172 and not @entity5			0
fate unclear : it 's not clear whether @entity135 , right , will be able to leave @entity84 for @entity1 and @entity138 , right , who currently hosts the @entity1 morning show ' @entity140 , ' could be out switch : @entity105 , left , is out , but @entity115 , right , is rehired for the @entity1 jingle he told @entity178 : ' i was told that they wanted the contributors to be more available -- essentially , closer to @entity5			2
i 'm not always available , i do n't live there			0
' @entity90 told @entity178 in an email : ' agree with everything @entity184 said			0
' i loved my time in and out at @entity1 and more , the many lifelong friendships made there			0
' @entity91 , a former @entity186 editor , left with a barb and sent out an email to staff saying that he stepped aside because @entity10 has what he called ' forceful ideas			0
' gone : @entity1 's managing editor @entity91 has resigned he then tried to smooth things over and said : ' for him to succeed , i believe he deserves his own team and management structure and the freedom to communicate one clear vision to the staff			0
' i have shared that conclusion with him and he has agreed to let me step down as managing editor and move on from @entity1			0
@entity10 will in fact take over @entity91 's role overseeing editorial content at @entity1 and there will no new managing editor appointed			1
@entity10 said in a statement : ' i want to thank @entity91 for his service at @entity1			1
we are grateful for his contributions and wish him the best in the future			0
' right - leaning @entity105 has been with @entity1 since 2010 when he started as a contributor on @entity0 , @entity39 , which has already been axed , before becoming a contributor across the network			1
the worst affected by the switch seems to be his daughter and on his @entity106 blog he wrote : ' when i told my 7 year old i had decided to leave , she laid on the sofa for an hour crying that she 'd never see @entity221 again			0
' he also wrote that even though he was not an ' easy fit ' at @entity1 and that the first month was ' tumultuous , ' he was grateful for the chance to ' learn to be friends with people who i disagreed with			0

new @entity1 chief @entity10 continues to make sweeping changes at network
@entity0 has been given an extension to his contract - and no new deal
