@entity0 and @entity1 investigated by @entity2 over ' sexist , racist and homophobic ' text messages during time at @entity4 @entity0 called @entity4 's @entity7 owner @entity6 a ' chink ' how @entity9 's exclusive story on @entity0 rocked football ... senior @entity2 figures are braced for a furious backlash if , as expected , they fail to charge @entity0 and @entity1 over their exchange of sexist , racist and homophobic texts and emails			1
the @entity2 will leave themselves open to accusations of inconsistency and weakness if they do not take action against the former @entity4 manager and the head of recruitment who worked alongside him in south @entity25			2
particularly when the correspondence was passed to the @entity2 by @entity4 , having been obtained through a search order of @entity1 's house granted by a high court judge			1
the @entity2 insist the matter is ongoing despite the fact that @entity32 first revealed the details of the texts and emails on august 21			1
but it appears to be reaching a conclusion with the belief being that the @entity2 will not charge @entity1 and @entity0			1
former @entity4 manager @entity0 is expected to avoid punishment for sending offensive texts and emails @entity0 and his former colleague @entity1 have been the subject of an @entity2 investigation since late august @entity4 owner @entity6 ( left ) helped uncover the offensive messages while investigating @entity0 and @entity1 ' @entity45			1
there 's enough dogs in @entity4 for us all to go around			0

not to be trusted ' on an official of another club ' not many white faces amongst that lot but worth considering			0

' on a player 's female agent a picture entitled @entity78 ( where every square was a " @entity81 " square ) sent to members of @entity4 's staff it is understood the @entity2 will cite their policy is not to act on ' private communications ' ; a position they adopted earlier this year when sexist emails sent by @entity90 chief executive @entity89 from his work inbox were leaked to the media			1
@entity2 officials realise there is likely to be uproar if they fail to act on the @entity0 and @entity1 messages that included deeply offensive remarks about players — @entity52 midfielder @entity51 and his representatives were referred to as ' @entity45 ' by @entity0 — as well as their own employers at @entity4 and football agents			1
the @entity2 is also expected to announce a review of the organisation 's policy on private communications			2
@entity0 has apologised for sending messages that were ' disrespectful of other cultures ' , while @entity1 resigned as director of football at @entity109 in a week when he hoped to appoint @entity0 as manager at the club			1
if there is no charge there is expected to be a detailed , written explanation from the @entity2 's governance department , outlining the efforts they went to in an attempt to bring charges against @entity0 and @entity1			1
@entity1 ( centre ) quit his role as sporting director of @entity109 after his behaviour was revealed @entity32 's chief sports reporter @entity9 broke the story about messages sent by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity0 's relationship with @entity6 ( right ) quickly deteriorated after @entity4 earned promotion to the top flight @entity0 : a powerful centre - back with @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 — winning five @entity136 caps — he began his managerial career at @entity138 club @entity134 in 2009 , after @entity139 resigned			1
he spent two years at @entity140 , safeguarding them from relegation , before moving to @entity4 in 2011			0
in his first season in charge of the @entity25 club , @entity0 , 42 , guided them to their first ever @entity148 final , which they lost to @entity149 on penalties and finished sixth in the @entity138 , though they missed out on promotion through the play - offs			2
still , 2012 ’s heartache proved to be short - lived , as @entity4 were promoted to the @entity90 as champions the following year			0
despite his successes , however , @entity0 ’s relationship with club owner @entity6 became increasingly strained			1
the @entity7 businessman was reportedly dissatisfied with @entity0 ’s transfer dealings			0
@entity0 was dismissed as @entity4 manager in december 2013			2
this , @entity32 understands , included requesting a statement from former @entity4 player @entity163 , who responded to the original revelations by tweeting and then deleting that @entity0 would call him the ' @entity165 ' during their time together at the club			1
whether a written explanation and review would appease those who feel @entity0 and @entity1 should be punished remains to be seen			1
@entity4 are sure to be unimpressed			0
but senior figures at the @entity2 already fear the organisation could be accused of double standards when players like @entity175 have been charged with misconduct for an alleged breach of @entity2 rules ; in @entity175 's case for referring to a @entity182 follower 's mother as a ' @entity183 ' , a @entity185 word for a promiscuous woman			0
the @entity2 could point to the fact that @entity175 communicated on a social media platform			0
but senior football officials see a major weakness in that particular ' private - public ' argument when last year @entity192 was condemned by the @entity2 for using the ' n ' word in a private text to another black former footballer , @entity195			2
the @entity2 accepted the resignation of anti-racism campaigner @entity192 from all his positions within the organisation after he made ' discriminatory abusive comments '			0
@entity192 , now back at the @entity2 as a member of the @entity201 , also stepped down as a trustee of the @entity203 campaign , and was criticised by then @entity2 chairman @entity205			2
@entity206 defender @entity175 was charged with misconduct by the @entity2 for a message sent on @entity182 @entity32 covered the @entity210 story right from the start , including @entity1 's resignation ( right ) former @entity4 player @entity163 claimed that @entity0 referred to him as the ' @entity214 ' @entity215 : as a graduate in @entity217 and @entity218 , @entity1 initially found work as a translator for the @entity222 side during @entity223 , before taking a staff writer ’s position at @entity226			1
in 2001 , he made the move to @entity228 , a @entity229 - based sports management franchise , then leaving to become @entity134 ’s press officer four years later			0
it was at @entity140 that @entity1 first linked up with @entity0 , forming a close professional relationship that saw him soon promoted to football operations manager			2
when @entity0 left for @entity4 in 2011 , @entity1 followed , this time as head of recruitment			1
@entity4 reached the @entity148 final in 2012 and were promoted to the @entity90 a year later , but amid a protracted bust - up between @entity0 and the club ’s controversial owner , @entity6 , @entity1 was dismissed in october 2013			1
he was replaced by 23 - year - old @entity240 , who was at the club on work experience and a friend of @entity6 ’s son			0
@entity109 were quick to appoint @entity1 as their sporting director , with a remit to improve their club infrastructure and to address weaknesses in player recruitment			1
' the use of discriminatory language is unacceptable regardless of its context and in effect has made @entity192 's position untenable , ' said @entity205			0
' the use of discriminatory language is unacceptable regardless of its context and in effect has made @entity192 's position untenable , ' said @entity205			0
now , however , context seems to be the central issue , even if other senior officials would argue that there is even an important distinction that should be recognised between the @entity89 case and the @entity1 and @entity0 case			2
as one observer put it , there is a ' clear work context ' in the communication between @entity1 and @entity0			1
the fear , claims another senior official , is that players will think there is one rule for them and another for people in positions of authority			0
the @entity89 case , and the decision under the leadership of chairman @entity281 not to act on private communication , led to calls from within the @entity2 to look at the policy of private and public accountability			2
this process was ongoing when the @entity210 story broke and the @entity2 governance department appear to have been struggling with the issue as a consequence			0
particularly when they know an attempt to charge @entity0 — and possibly even hit him with a ban that would come into effect the moment he lands a new managerial role — could face a serious legal challenge , perhaps even with the support of the @entity298			2
@entity192 ( left ) resigned from his role at @entity203 after making ' discriminatory abusive comments ' in a text @entity90 chief executive @entity89 ( centre ) was caught in a sexism scandal earlier this year the @entity298 also came in for serious criticism in august when they initially attempted to defend @entity0 by dismissing his comments as ' friendly text message banter ' , and had to then apologise for the wording of the apology			1
there is nothing in the @entity2 rules on discrimination exempting private correspondence but the controversial policy of not prosecuting such cases also recently benefited referees chief @entity316 , who made racist remarks to @entity318 , a black non-league referee coaching manager			2
@entity316 was ordered by the @entity2 to attend an equality and diversity training course but that was seen as little more than a slap on the wrists			0
the view of many within football is that the @entity2 's current policy is not sustainable in the digital age			0
' having taken a stance on @entity89 it was not long before the @entity1 and @entity0 case put the @entity2 in a very uncomfortable position , ' said another insider			1
legal experts argue that there is no basis for why the @entity2 could not bring a misconduct charge for private communication			1
as @entity339 @entity338 explained : ' whether or not the alleged remarks are made in private or in public does not matter			0
the fact is they were made and the reality is the @entity2 have a choice what to do about it			0

@entity0 and @entity1 sent a number of offensive texts and emails
@entity32 exclusively revealed the messages back in august
the @entity2 are not expected to charge them as their communication was private
but others have been punished for sending private messages
@entity0 missed out on a job at @entity109 and @entity1 resigned from his role as sporting director at @entity363
the messages were uncovered during an investigation by @entity4 owner @entity6
