by @entity1 reporter distraught : the couple took supplements that made the mother seem pregnant			1
but when they got back to the @entity8 they were arrested and the baby seized a @entity8 couple ‘ fell under the spell ’ of @entity13 fraudsters who gave the woman herbal remedies and tricked her into thinking she had given birth , the @entity10 heard			1
the court was told how the husband and wife still can not accept the baby girl they brought home from @entity13 two years ago is not their own – despite dna tests proving they are not the natural parents			1
social workers arrested the couple after they returned to the @entity8 , accusing them of being knowing parties in the fraud			1
the court heard how the little girl is now ‘ effectively an orphan ’ with no prospect of ever learning who her real parents are – and faces growing up in the @entity8 care system			1
now a judge has cleared the ‘ intelligent , educated , hard working ’ couple of any involvement in the scam , possibly paving the way for her to be returned to them			2
family judge @entity46 told the court how for ten years the couple , who can not be named , tried surgery , laser treatment and @entity51 to start a family – but to no avail			1
then in 2010 the husband ran into a university friend who told him of a couple who had had twins after ‘ some herbal treatment ’ in @entity13			1
the desperate couple decided to travel to @entity61 , where they were prescribed a course of herbal remedies by a man calling himself dr @entity66			1
after taking the herbs and returning to @entity8 , the woman ’s face , arms and abdomen swelled as if she was pregnant			1
even a ‘ kindly and well - meaning ’ local gp accepted she was seven months ’ pregnant , and signed off a maternity certificate			2
the couple then returned to @entity13 for further treatment			1
duped : the couple were told by a university friend to visit dr @entity66 in @entity13 's coastal city of @entity80 where they were given herbs that made the mother swell up as if pregnant at a clinic near the capital @entity80 , they handed over £ 4,500 and the woman was given a brown liquid to drink before entering what she thought was a delivery room			1
the man waited in the corridor outside and , after few minutes , he heard a baby cry			0
he entered the room to find the baby girl – referred to in court only as ‘ a ’ – lying on the bed beside his groggy wife			0
he was duped into believing he had seen the umbilical cord cut and was given a placenta in a plastic bag			1
after pocketing the couple ’s money , dr @entity102 wrote : ‘ treatment successful , patient delivered of a baby girl			1
@entity108 ’s doing ’ , which was the sole document that accompanied the birth			0
after returning home to the @entity8 they were arrested and @entity113 was taken into police protection			2
to the couple ’s ‘ considerable dismay and shock ’ , dna tests proved that the girl was not their child			1
cleared : mrs @entity121 ruled the ' intelligent , educated , hard - working ' couple were unaware of the scam having waited so long for a baby , the couple simply could not accept the truth , the court heard			2
far from seeing themselves as victims , they insisted that ‘ the combination of spiritual and herbal treatments was so powerful as to be able to change dna ’			2
but mrs @entity121 said : ‘ there is no evidence before me to say that the result of the dna testing was wrong or likely to be wrong			0
i do not accept the explanation of the parents			0
‘ on that basis i have to accept the validity of the results and find that the baby is not the biological child of the putative parents			2
’ social workers in the @entity147 of @entity148 , as well as the child ’s court - appointed guardian , argued that the couple were ‘ knowing parties to an elaborate fraud and charade upon the @entity8 immigration authorities and now parties to an attempted fraud on the court ’			2
they claimed the couple ’s account of the birth was ‘ littered with inconsistency ’ and implausibly embellished			0
mrs @entity121 conceded : ‘ at first blush , the immediate reaction of the ordinary man on the proverbial @entity166 omnibus would no doubt be , “ do n’t be daft , its a fraud , they knew it ”			0
’ however , noting the ‘ enormous difficulty ’ the couple had had in conceiving a child , mrs @entity121 took them at their word when they said they would ‘ never seek to buy a baby ’			0
she added : ‘ despite their education and intelligence , they are struggling with the result of the dna test			0
both of them say they still believe that @entity113 is their natural child			0
‘ in the end , having considered all the evidence ... i am driven to conclude that in some way they allowed themselves to be duped by fraudsters			0
‘ they so much wanted a baby ... they allowed themselves to fall under the spell of the herbalists , believing what was said to the mother and acting faithfully upon the instructions given to them			0
‘ contrary to the submissions of the local authority and guardian i do not find that the parents were wilfully and knowingly involved with or parties to a wrongful removal of a from her mother , or that they cynically “ bought ” a baby			2
’ the @entity212 heard the little girl , named only as a during proceedings , could spend life in care the judge concluded : ‘ what is clear to me , having found that she is not their biological child but the child of another mother and father , and having been removed from her mother very soon after her birth , is that a certainly is the victim of wrongdoing and illegality , and very possibly her mother as well			1
‘ the fact remains that @entity113 is effectively an orphan			0
there is no one in this country who has parental responsibility for her and no information as to her birth , parentage or background			0
’ mrs @entity121 ordered a further hearing to decide where @entity113 ’s best interests lie			0
her finding that the couple were innocent dupes could improve their chances of persuading the court that a should be returned to them .			0
