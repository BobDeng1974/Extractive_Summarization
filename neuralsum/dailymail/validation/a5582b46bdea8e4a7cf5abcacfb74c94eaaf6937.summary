the young @entity0 have been ordered to change their personal email addresses amid growing fears that they are being targeted by online hackers			1
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , as well as @entity7 and @entity8 , have been told to make the urgent changes after security officials detected a new threat of corporate and government snooping – most probably coming from @entity13 – aimed at the @entity0			1
the younger members of the royal family are seen as particularly vulnerable because of their use of social media			2
and the espionage risk is being taken so seriously that prince @entity4 is believed to have also been told he must close down his @entity20 page			1
i 'm told the threat has been picked up over the past five weeks and comes from hackers looking to expose state secrets and details of multi-million - pound deals , as well as @entity35 gossip			2
it is thought that snoops are offering huge rewards to anyone who can manage to hack into the @entity35 accounts			0
the young @entity0 have all been warned that just one careless or unguarded remark could be enough to jeopardise lucrative contracts			2
a source told me : ' younger members of the @entity0 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , even @entity7 and @entity8 , have been warned they are targets of electronic hackers attempting to intercept their emails			1
' they are after any useful information about high - level @entity51 plans that could affect major companies or industries			0
in the financial world , advance knowledge is worth millions			0
one slip could cost millions in business			0
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 have been told to make the urgent changes after security officials detected a new threat of corporate and government snooping ' and they have been warned to be on guard			1
they have to report anything strange that pops up immediately			0
' the warning has apparently come as quite the shock to the young @entity0 , who – perhaps naively – had ' no idea ' they could be a target			2
a threat from closer to home was exposed last year , when @entity73 , former royal editor at the now defunct @entity74 admitted in court to hacking the phones of @entity6 , @entity5 and @entity4 almost 200 times			1
and when @entity4 was in @entity79 , elaborate security precautions had to be put in place so he could communicate with his then girlfriend @entity81 while he was away			1
@entity4 , known as captain @entity83 at work , had a specially encrypted ' @entity86 ' so he could call her without being overheard during his second , 20 - week tour that ended in january 2013			2
security issues aside , some of @entity4 's close friends will be joking that there 's another reason behind the change in address			1
in typical laddish style , his previous account included the figures ' 69 ' – a suggestive allusion to a sexual position and a sure - fire way to raise a few eyebrows			0
when @entity4 was in @entity79 , elaborate security precautions had to be put in place so he could communicate with his then girlfriend @entity81 while he was away the @entity105 could see an unexpected @entity35 arrival as the @entity107 and @entity5 prepare for the birth of their second baby			1
with @entity5 living at the couple ’s @entity113 estate , @entity115 , aides have been sent to check out local hospitals ‘ just in case ’ she ca n’t make it to the @entity118 at @entity119 ’s in @entity120 in time for the birth next month			0
among those closest to @entity115 is the world - renowned @entity124 ’s in @entity126			0
‘ if there is a sudden emergency in @entity113 and there is no time to get @entity5 to @entity120 , she will go to the nearest hospital , ’ reveals an insider			0
