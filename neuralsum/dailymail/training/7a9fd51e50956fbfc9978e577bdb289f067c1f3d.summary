by @entity0 last updated at 7:30 pm on 22nd september 2011 @entity1 , chief operating officer of @entity2 , is expected to launch the @entity3 5 on october 4 @entity4 , a board member of @entity2 , seemed to give the biggest hint yet of what the tech giant had in store for us in october - referring to ' the new iphones released next month			1
' this seemed to confirm two rumours : one , that there would be more than one model , and two , that they would both appear late next month			0
mr @entity4 's statements - at a conference in @entity18 - also tied in closely with the most credible of the recent @entity3 rumours			0
@entity20 said @entity2 is expected to hold its next big media event on october 4 , when it is expected to launch the @entity3			1
@entity2 plans to make the new device available for purchase within a few weeks of the launch , sources added			0
as usual , the company declined to comment			0
while the @entity3 is much anticipated , there is more at stake than usual			0
this is because , since legendary outgoing ceo and co-founder @entity32 announced his departure , it will be newly installed ceo @entity1 â€™s first big product introduction , and the place where the public will get a first lengthy impression of him			0
people have wondered whether @entity2 can continue to compete without its creative driving force - especially as rivals such as @entity42 continue to gain ground on the tech giant			2
could @entity4 have revealed not one , but two big secrets about @entity2 - a company of which he is a board member ? ever since @entity2 launched its @entity3 , it 's been an open secret that @entity42 makes many of the components inside it - in fact @entity42 's ceo has admitted , ' @entity2 is our biggest customer			1
' but ever since @entity42 launched its own @entity58 series of phones and tablets - high - powered touchscreens whose flagship , the @entity62 , currently outpaces @entity3 on the processing front - legal war has erupted between the companies in nine countries			1
this week , a @entity42 source revealed @entity42 was considering legal action to ban @entity2 's upcoming @entity3 5 in @entity69 - after an executive admitted a similar move in @entity42 's native @entity72 was planned			1
too similar ? @entity42 's @entity73 and @entity3 are the subject of a bitter legal dispute in several countries a @entity42 executive told the @entity77 this week , ' when the @entity3 arrives here , @entity42 plans to take @entity2 to court here for its violation of @entity42 's wireless technology related patents			1
' this is in response to @entity2 's continued legal action against @entity42 's @entity58 family of touchscreen tablets and smartphones - some of which are currently illegal in @entity69 , thanks to @entity2 lawsuits claiming they are ' slavish ' copies of @entity3 and @entity92			1
@entity42 recently overtook @entity93 in the smartphone market , and its @entity62 offers a larger screen and faster processor than @entity97 - and has been a huge hit among geeky smartphone connoisseurs			0
this month , @entity2 even forced @entity42 to withdraw a prototype tablet device from the show floor of a @entity103 electronics show			2
@entity42 's larger @entity58 10.1 tablet remains illegal in @entity69 thanks to @entity2 's legal action			1
the @entity106 reported that the @entity108 firm may seek an injunction against @entity2 's new @entity3 in @entity69			1
@entity42 said it would not comment on ongoing legal issues			0
legal battle rages between @entity2 and @entity42 over alleged ' similarities between their touchscreen smartphones and handsets the two technology firms have been locked in intensifying legal battles in nine countries over their flagship smartphone and tablet products - battles made more complex by the fact that many related patents are held by other internet giants such as @entity124 and @entity125			2
the latest attacks come after @entity2 successfully blocked @entity42 from selling its latest tablets in @entity128 and some smartphone models in the @entity130 and forced its rival to delay launching new tablets in @entity133			2
after @entity2 's latest legal victory in @entity128 earlier this month , @entity42 said it would take all available legal options			0
@entity2 first sued @entity42 in april , claiming its strongest competitor had ' slavishly ' copied its product designs , and @entity42 had since counter-sued , arguing @entity2 infringed on its mobile technologies .			0

official *announcements* expected on october 4
@entity42 may sue to make @entity3 illegal in @entity69
company ' will sue ' to stop @entity3 selling in @entity72
@entity2 lawsuits attack @entity42 touchscreens
