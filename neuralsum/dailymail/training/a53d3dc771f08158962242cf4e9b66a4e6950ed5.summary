well past its prime the dilapidated @entity0 listed @entity3 landmark at 95 @entity4 in @entity5 is set for a rebirth as a four - bedroom residence that will boast a price tag of £ 70million			1
the exclusive location overlooking @entity10 , and the fact @entity12 is a close neighbour , are among the reasons that justify such an eye - watering sum for the building that was most recently the members - only @entity19			1
but in its heyday , the building was among the most impressive homes in @entity5 and part of the same @entity23 that was home to the @entity24 between 1829 and 1850 and @entity25 during his term as prime minister			1
@entity0 - listed @entity3 landmark , 95 @entity4 , is set for a rebirth as a four - bedroom home worth £ 70million the exclusive residence overlooks @entity10 and is on the other side of the park to @entity12 it became @entity19 soon after the group 's first meeting in 1918 and the men 's only clique for @entity40 expats remained tenants until the 1980s , when a long - running fixed rental lease expired			1
despite being a grand icon of @entity3 architecture , the former home built in the early 1800s has been empty for almost 30 years and in recent times has looked worse for wear			1
water ingress , dry rot and vermin infestation have left the @entity52 mansion in ' poor condition ' and with ' extensive damage ' , hardly befitting the grand company it keeps			0
but along with the neighbouring @entity57 , the main part of the @entity23 at @entity59 , no 95 was bought by the billionaire @entity60 as part of a £ 130million deal in 2011 and they now have approval for significant works to be carried out			1
@entity66 and partners have been commissioned to redevelop 95 @entity4 and return it to its original purpose as a single family home with four bedrooms			1
planning permission has been granted by @entity73 to completely refurbish the home , change the layout and create a new basement level which will feature a swimming pool and spa			2
while in bad condition , the historic fabric and plan form of the principal rooms remain largely intact , many of which have grand features including impressive fireplaces , high ceilings and a stunning central staircase			0
along with the neighbouring in and @entity57 , the main part of the @entity23 at @entity59 , no 95 was bought by the billionaire @entity60 as part of a £ 130million deal in 2011 a beautiful central staircase remains in impeccable condition but the place over all is significantly rundown when completed , 95 @entity4 will have a passenger lift , while an additional staircase will be built to access the new basement , which will include a swimming pool , lounge , gym and spa			1
the basement will feature a large kitchen and dining room , wine cellars and staff accommodation			0
the ground floor has the grand entrance lobby , and reception room along with the sitting / media room			0
all these rooms are dominated by huge pillars and high ceilings			0
when completed , 95 @entity4 will have a lift , and an additional staircase will be built to access the basement the @entity19 , a men 's only club for @entity40 expats , occupied by the building from 1918 to the 1980s on the first floor , there is a principal front room , rear dining room , a pantry and study while the second floor will be one giant suite and boast a huge master bedroom , which has its own private living room , a walk - in wardrobe , two bathrooms and a master study			1
there are three further super-sized bedrooms - all of which will have large en - suite bathrooms and dressing rooms - on the third floor , while the top floor will have a family room and outdoor terrace			2
this image of the study shows the extensive water damage and dry rot in the house the result will be a four - bedroom home worth around £ 70million , making it 400 times more expensive than a typical house in @entity151 and @entity152 , with stamp duty expected to be in excess of £ 8.3million			1
@entity155 , managing director of @entity157 estate agency , is certain the property will be stunning when ready			0
she said : ' i think we 're talking about it being a £ 70million home and that 's being conservative			1
the refurbishment will be to a very high standard and you 're overlooking the park			0
this is what people are looking for			0
' to refurbish a place like this , you 'll be looking at spending between £ 800 and £ 1,000 per square foot and this includes furniture			2
' it is likely whoever wants to buy will want to be able to move straight away			0
they want an ease of life			0
" @entity181 " properties allow this			0
' @entity183 and @entity184 , who are worth around £ 9bn , have made a fortune in the property market			1
when complete , that property which has also been known as @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity57 , is expected to be able to fetch more than £ 200million and take the crown as @entity5 's most expensive home			2
before @entity193 , the road was known for its private homes			0
number 145 , which was destroyed during the war , was a 25 - bedroom mansion which was the childhood home between 1927 and 1937 of @entity199 and princess @entity200			1
after @entity193 , due to the lack of offices in the @entity203 , @entity4 became a commercial road lined with hotels , the @entity207 embassy , offices and plush clubs			2
@entity210 , chief executive of @entity52 estate agency @entity211 , believes the area is being transformed back into a prime residential area			2
a sketch dated 1885 of the first floor dining room at 95 @entity4 , once one of @entity5 's grandest homes the rundown interiors of the home 's soon - to - be grand bedrooms , once developed by the @entity60 he said : ' booming residential values are driving the transformation of the thoroughfare back into a super-prime residential address with a series of trophy properties , super-luxury apartments and penthouses in the pipeline			1
' these mansions also provide great economic benefits through refurbishment and architectural restoration , the trickle - down effect of wealth does work in property restoration			2
' @entity155 added it would be difficult to say who exactly will be looking to buy a home like 95 @entity4 with the mansion likely to have a broad appeal to the wealthiest home buyers			1
' @entity52 is n't typical of most prime areas of @entity5 , ' she said			2
' i do n't think you can categorise exactly who might buy it			0
you do n't just get super-rich @entity252 and @entity253 buyers			0
' there are also a lot of @entity256 and @entity40 buyers who will be interested in a home like this			2
' what is interesting about properties like this one is that they were originally very grand residences and they are being returned to their original purpose			0
' @entity52 , in particular , is going back to what it was like in the 1800s			0
' at the moment i have three to four people looking for £ 50 million - plus homes but there is a shortage of choice			1
i think when this will be completed , it will be stunning			0
