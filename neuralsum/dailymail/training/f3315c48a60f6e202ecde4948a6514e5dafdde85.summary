by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 06:36 est , 30 november 2012 a teenager who visited doctors with ' heartburn ' was amazed to find he actually had a cyst the size of a grapefruit crushing his heart , and forcing it 3cm to the right			1
stunned doctors told 19 year old @entity12 if they had not caught the growth his heart would have exploded			1
mr @entity12 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , had initially believed he was suffering from chronic heart burn but was rushed to hospital after collapsing at work			1
now and then : doctors told @entity12 ( now , left ) if they had not caught the growth his heart would have exploded ( after the operation , right ) doctors performed an x-ray which revealed a large shadow on his left lung but medics were left in shock when a ct scan revealed a grapefruit - sized cyst pressing against his heart			1
they said it was growing at such a rapid rate it was literally forcing his major organs across to the opposite side of his body			2
he underwent a six hour operation at @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity15 , in june to remove the 15cm by 12cm growth			2
but , remarkably , mr @entity12 was back at work as a production assistant within three months of the massive operation and has since made a full recovery			1
he said : ' i was just at work and sat down but every time i breathed in it hurt			2
' the boss said go to hospital to get it checked			2
i expected to be back by lunch but ended up being off for three months			0
scarred : the cyst was growing at such a rapid rate it was literally forcing his major organs across to the opposite side of his body			2
it measured 15cm by 12cm - the same size as an average grapefruit mr @entity12 underwent a six hour operation at @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity15 , in june to remove the 15cm by 12cm growth ' i was really worried after the scan , i did n’t know anything about it			1
today the teenager is back in good health and is back at work ' they said it was really rare and they had never seen anything like it			0
it had moved my heart 3cm to the right			1
' i was in theatre for six hours in the end			0
they cut me open from the back and they had to crack a few ribs			0
' they managed to cut it out and reconnect a vein that it was connected to			0
i was in hospital for six days after and had three months off work			0
' ' i could n’t sit up properly and even now i ca n’t lift heavy stuff			0
i ca n’t believe something so big was growing inside me and i did n’t know anything about it			2
' doctors told me it was like dodging a seven inch bullet			1
i ’m surprised to be alive today			0
' mr @entity12 had been planning a holiday for the end of june			1
but doctors told him if he had left the cyst untreated until then , it would have killed him			1
he added : “ doctors said if i had gone on holiday in a plane like we were planning to in june , the pressure would ’ve been too much and my heart would ’ve exploded			1
' i ’m very grateful to the hospital for operating so quickly			0
' my parents were really worried about it and my girlfriend @entity114 hated it because the operation was on her 18th birthday			0
' she knew how important it was though and as soon as i came back around she was fine			0
i feel very lucky to be here today , it ’s amazing my life was saved thanks to a bit of indigestion			0

doctors told @entity12 , 19 , if he had left the cyst untreated it would have killed him
the growth was so big it had pushed his heart 3cm to the right
