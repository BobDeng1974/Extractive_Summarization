caging him judge @entity44 described @entity6 as ' wicked ' and told him he had put others ' lives at risk			1
he said : ' it was a wicked thing to do			0
in the terrible circumstances of intending to take your own life , the way you did it was to risk the lives of others			0
' his history is a sad and tortured one			0
the problem is that if someone in that awful position decides to kill themselves by risking other people 's lives , it is a very serious crime			0
' i have been able to see material about your personal history			0
i am not going to recite it in public , but you have had serious difficulties in your life			0
' by august last year it is obvious that you had become desperate and determined to kill yourself , which is an awful position for anyone to be in			0
' i do n't want you to think that when i described your behaviour as wicked i am ignoring the degree of desperation you had reached , nor is it a case where you were so clear - thinking that you identified someone 's house and decided you were going to drive into it , not caring about who may also lose their life			1
' without really giving proper consideration to what it was you were driving at you drove straight at that lodge			2
repairs to the building to return it to the state it was in before the crash are almost completed ' it was a wicked thing to do			2
' mr @entity9 told police he heard a noise like a low flying bomber just seconds before the @entity14 slammed through the wall			0
he looked out of the kitchen window to see the car careering towards him at breakneck speed			2
the court heard that @entity6 had called police in the hours before the smash , telling them he was suicidal , but did not want to be arrested			1
in interview after the incident he said he had little memory of it , but could recall sobbing before slamming into the side of what he thought was an unused shop			0
@entity6 and the @entity119 family did not know each other			1
@entity121 , defending , said @entity6 was at an ' extremely low ebb ' and that prison would just compound the problems			1
he added that @entity6 had struggled since the death of his father when he was just 15			1
speaking after the hearing a spokesperson for the @entity119 family said : ' what is done is done , but this has had a real impact on mr and mrs @entity119 , who are in their 70s and lived at the house for 30 years			2
' it is a listed building and the repairs have only just been completed			2
' people say , living on a corner , the house must have been hit by cars many times but this was the first			2
' the building was built in the early 19th century as a toll house @entity6 's @entity14 was left barely recognisable and firefighters were forced to cut off the doors in order to free the suicidal driver			1
the toll house is currently being restored to the condition it was in , but remains covered in fences and a protective sheet			2
speaking yesterday , the @entity119 's daughter @entity153 said the family were just looking to move on from the incident			0
she said : ' i do n't want to say too much but the man was local to here so should have known it was an occupied house			0
