by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 04:05 est , 9 august 2013 driving off a crowded @entity3 beach after teaching disabled children to surf , @entity1 found his path blocked by hundreds of holidaymakers – and with the tide rushing in			1
he activated his lights , sounded sirens and used his vehicle ’s @entity11 to urge people to move			0
but the more noise he made , the more people swarmed around the @entity16 and trailer to see what was going on			2
realising he was trapped mr @entity1 freed the trailer , which went floating out to sea within minutes			1
but he was unable to drive the @entity16 away and it was engulfed on the beach by the tide			2
mr @entity1 , 38 , swam out to the trailer – packed with vital equipment for his not - for - profit surf school – and climbed on top of it until it was towed back to shore by a fishing vessel			1
but that was only the beginning of his tale of woe , which unfolded at @entity22 in @entity23 on wednesday afternoon			2
an @entity45 lifeboat and other vessels surround the stranded trailer by @entity22 in @entity23 yesterday sticky situation : mr @entity1 claims tourists on the beach prevented him from moving his trailer in time to avoid the incoming tide - leaving him with no choice but to detach it from his truck and let it drift out to sea ransacked : mr @entity1 's submerged @entity16 which could n't be recovered until the low tide came in this morning when it had already been looted by snorkelers overnight good timing : a passing fishing trawler spots mr @entity1 on his trailer as it drifts further and further out to sea determined : the fishing vessel and another boat come to mr @entity1 's aid as he refuses to let his trailer disappear into the ocean he had been unable to save the @entity16 because although he had sand mats and a winch system that might have allowed him to drive it off the beach , he decided not to use the equipment because of the risk of injuring onlookers			1
the inshore lifeboat ’s attempt to tow the submerged vehicle failed			0
then at 10pm on wednesday mr @entity1 received a phone call to tell him that snorkellers were looting the @entity16			2
‘ it was tourists , or should i say opportunists , ’ he said yesterday			0
rescue : the fishing vessel towed mr @entity1 and his trailer in to the harbour in @entity23 coming ashore : mr @entity1 and his trailer pictured being towed towards the shore			1
unfortunately the @entity45 could n't move his @entity16 which was also submerged until the tide went out this morning ‘ we all know each other around here and it ’s a very small community , so it was n’t local residents			1
’ around £ 2,000 worth of wetsuits , tools , surfboards and equipment were stolen from the @entity16 which is a write - off			0
the looters vanished before police arrived			0
‘ they were n’t stealing from me , they were stealing from people less fortunate than themselves , from disabled children and adults , ’ said mr @entity1 , who is the director of @entity100 and has been teaching disadvantaged and disabled youngsters to surf for seven years			1
however , his plight has brought a generous response from strangers and @entity110 readers , who have offered equipment and cash , including one offer of £ 500			0
‘ the response has been amazing , ’ he said			0
‘ it has restored my faith in human nature			0
’ ordeal : while mr @entity1 managed to get his trailer back to shore relatively undamaged , his @entity16 was looted overnight before he had a chance to retrieve it help at hand : mr @entity1 prepares to jump off his trailer as members of @entity45 come to assist him to shore safe at last : the trailer was safely brought ashore in @entity23 yesterday with remarkably little damage after being washed out to sea video courtesy of the @entity128			1

@entity1 runs a not - for - profit organisation teaching disabled children to surf
after *finishing* a class he attempted to drive off @entity22 in @entity23
his @entity16 became submerged while his trailer was washed out to sea
the trailer was towed back to shore but the @entity16 could n't be recovered until this morning - and it had already been looted overnight
