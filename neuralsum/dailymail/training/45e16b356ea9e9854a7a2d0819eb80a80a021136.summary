@entity1 , the clerk of @entity2 , in @entity3 , has been off work since march with an ' ongoing neck complaint '			1
but instead of asking the deputy town clerk to replace her , the council voted to pay £ 6,900 for mrs @entity1 to have specialist surgery on her neck			1
council leader and mayor councillor @entity18 argued that mrs @entity1 , 45 , would have had to wait six weeks to have the operation on the @entity21			1
three @entity23 councillors voted against the decision and said taxpayers ' money should not have been used to get mrs @entity1 priority treatment			1
they accused the council of attempting to cover up the cost of the treatment by holding secret meetings to discuss it			1
and they said it was unfair for one employee to receive private healthcare when others do not			0
local resident @entity37 , 67 , of @entity38 , @entity3 , said : ' how dare councillors vote to spend our money on private healthcare for an employee ? ' no doubt @entity1 is very good at her job - probably better than many of the councillors are at their job of running our town			0
' if she has a painful problem she should use the @entity21 or , if she can afford to , use private medicine if she chooses			0
' fellow resident @entity52 , 63 , added : ' would it not have been nicer and more appropriate to dip into their own pockets to aid their colleague , and not those of the over-taxed householders and rate payers ? ' the three @entity23 councillors who voted against paying for the treatment have called for the council to publish a full report on the issue			1
mayor @entity18 has since announced that the issue will be brought before the next full council meeting on may 23 where residents can voice their opinions			0
he said : ' we did it in order to give us the best chance of the town clerk returning to work as soon as possible			2
@entity73 , the home of @entity2 ' we wanted to ensure she was off work for the shortest amount of time possible			2
we run the town council based on the numbers of staff			1
we need a full complement of staff			0
' we took the view that it was in the best interests of the council ' we were told the @entity21 waiting list would be six weeks but that it could be considerably longer than that			2
' would it not have been nicer and more appropriate to dip into their own pockets to aid their colleague , and not those of the over-taxed householders and rate payers ? ' - resident @entity52 ' we would have had to get in a replacement on a consultancy basis which would cost a considerable amount of money			0
' obviously there are a lot of unknowns in this			0
the operation has been a success but we have not heard when she will be back at work			0
' @entity109 , chief executive of the @entity110 , said : ' it 's important that council staff are fit for work so that taxpayers are not paying a hefty amount of sick pay			2
' however , taxpayers are right to question why exactly the council has forked out thousands for this private surgery			0
' local residents want to know that the money they pay in tax is being spent in the most cost effective manner so the town councillors have a lot of explaining to do as to why they splashed out on costly medical procedures			2
