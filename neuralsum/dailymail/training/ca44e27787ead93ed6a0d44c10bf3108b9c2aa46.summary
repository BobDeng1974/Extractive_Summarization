a cleaner has been reunited with his wallet after dropping it in to a marina 100 feet deep more than two years ago			1
@entity6 's leather wallet slipped out of his pocket into the water while he was working in november 2012			1
the 23 - year - old thought he 'd lost it forever until a diver found it while carrying out maintenance work on some pontoons			1
cleaner @entity6 was reunited with his wallet , including his driving licence and a @entity18 bank card , two years after he dropped it in to the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 mr @entity6 , who works for @entity22 , said he ' could n't believe ' the wallet had been discovered near @entity19 , in @entity20 , @entity21			1
remarkably it still contained his driving licence as well as a @entity18 bank card and @entity28 and @entity29 store cards			1
he told the @entity30 : ' it 's amazing because i thought i 'd never see it again			2
' i remember reaching down to pick up a log from the water and then i heard something drop into the water			0
i looked over and just saw a few bubbles and then realised what had happened			0
' when i was told it had been found i could n't believe it			2
the water there is so deep i thought it was gone forever			1
' @entity45 , managing director of @entity46 , described it as ' remarkable ' saying the chances of finding the wallet ' were pretty much nil			2
' ' it 's an astonishing story especially when you consider the depth of the water and the tides ' , he said			0
' when he lost it , @entity57 was working in the deepest part of the marina which has a depth of about 30 metres			1
' if divers are operating on the seabed , at that depth , they would have about 20 minutes of bottom time			0
' the chances of them stumbling across a wallet would be pretty much nil			2
it was a chance find and that 's what makes it even more remarkable			0
' when you imagine the storms we had last year , and the amount of movement in the water it is simply remarkable that they 've found it			2
' the wallet was discovered by diver @entity85 , carrying out maintenance work on some pontoons near @entity19 ( pictured ) - he then handed it in to the marina 's reception who identified mr @entity6 mr @entity6 , who lives in @entity20 , was reunited with the wallet after the diver , @entity85 , handed it in to the marina 's reception who identified the cleaner			1

' when i heard that they had found it my immediate response was " i remember him losing it - but that was over two years ago "			0
' it 's more than 100ft deep in places where he lost it and there 's a strong tidal pull			1
when you think about it it could have drifted a long way away but it did n't			0
it 's unbelievable that it has n't been washed away			0
' he said he was n't surprised when mr @entity6 lost the wallet			1
' he is a bit accident prone ' , he revealed .			0

@entity6 lost his leather *weather* while working in november 2012
thought it was lost forever until a diver found it doing maintenance work
the wallet still contained his driving licence as well as a @entity18 bank card
this was despite it being in a 100ft deep marina with a strong tidal pull
