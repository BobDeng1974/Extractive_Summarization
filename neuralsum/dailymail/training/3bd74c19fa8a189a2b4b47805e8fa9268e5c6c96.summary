i was just walking to my boyfriend ’s house and was n’t expecting to be attacked			2
' i had to jump over a wall to get away from them , then i called my @entity47 and he came and took me straight to hospital			2
' mrs @entity8 , 45 , said : ' i am absolutely devastated			1
if they are doing that at the age of 15 what are they going to be doing at the age of 25 ? ' there is no justice			2
they have got away unpunished , but it will always be at the back of @entity8 ’s mind			1
@entity8 , pictured this month , has only just been able to return to school 10 months on and regained the confidence to relive the horror of the attack ' i still ca n’t look at the pictures			1
it ’s like somebody ripped my heart out and threw it away			2

she is scarred for life			2
it will be seen on wedding photos			0
' it tore her world apart , she was so upset and could n’t sleep but she ’s really turned her life around			0
' she continued : ' at my age there would be somewhere these kids would be sent - stick them in the army i say			0
' because they are juveniles they have got away with it			0
if the main offender does it again she will end up in front of a judge , but why give them a chance to do it again ? ' in the moments after the attack , @entity8 managed to hide behind a wall and call her father , who rushed to help her and took her to hospital			1
she was discharged that evening but found out four weeks later her nose was in fact broken and had to have surgery			0
despite suffering serious internal bruising , post traumatic stress disorder and being left with a permanent scar on her top lip and jaw , the aspiring @entity103 servicewoman has put the attack behind her			0

she has now been chosen by the @entity118 committee to be a 2012 torch bearer			0
@entity8 added : ' i want to show everyone they can turn their life around no matter what has happened to them			1
' i was on a downward slope but managed to turn things around			0
i still ca n’t go to @entity32 but i ’m doing so much better than i thought i could ever be			0
' this is the happiest i ’ve been since the attack , i could n’t believe it when my mum phoned me to tell me i ’d been selected			0
i ’m really excited , it ’s a once in a lifetime opportunity			0
' a @entity136 spokesman said the case was passed to the @entity138 who decided not to press charges but to give a caution for common assault			1
she said : ' age is a factor in the decision but everything would have been taken into account			0
her ( @entity8 ) injuries would form part of the evidence			1
' the case would have been handed over the the @entity138 and various other agencies			1
' evidence would have been looked at to come to the decision that a caution was the necessary action to take in this case			2
