it 's a new theory that could shatter everything you thought you knew about @entity3			0
die - hard fans of the satirical cartoon have proposed that @entity6 never awoke from a coma he fell into during an episode in 1993 and that everything that occurred on the series after that happened inside @entity6 's head			1
while seeming outlandish on the surface , the theory is gaining a lot of traction in online @entity3 forums , with even the most devout of followers declaring they believe it			0
the theory lays claim to why the characters never age , and how the show moved from mundane episodes in the early 90s , such as @entity24 cheating on an iq test , to plots that saw mr. @entity27 capturing the @entity28			0
in it , @entity6 ponders the meaning of life during a conversation with @entity33			0
he insists he ca n't wait until he 's dead to find out , to which @entity33 says : ' you ca n't wait six months ? ' six months later , in april 1993 episode ' so it ’s come to this : @entity51 ' , @entity6 is crushed by a vending machine after an @entity54 's prank by @entity24 goes wrong			1
he is taken to hospital in a coma			0
comatose : @entity6 ends up in hospital in an april 1993 episode after one of @entity24 's pranks goes awry theory : every episode since this one is a dream from inside @entity6 's head watch full explanation of the theory at the end of the episode , @entity6 abruptly awakes from the coma , strangling @entity24 , and then the credits roll			1
' i propose that @entity6 did n’t actually wake up from his coma			2
he is still in a vegetative state and every single @entity3 episode afterwards is in @entity6 ’s imagination , ' the @entity38 user theorizes			1
' @entity6 remembers @entity24 , @entity79 , and @entity80 as 10 , 8 , and 1 year old , so they will always appear that way in his dreams			0
' the theory claims the show , which started simply as a tongue - in - cheek portrayal of middle - class @entity87 , became radically different from 1993			1
there was @entity6 going into space , a look - into - the - future where @entity79 was president , and an episode devoted almost entirely to @entity94 's 100 - year - old bar rag , which turns out to be his best friend			2
@entity96 : the theory claims the show became more ' zany ' after the coma episode in 1993 , with episodes such as @entity6 going into space it also claims to show how a never - ending stream of celebrities came to come in contact with the @entity3 over the years			1
this is clearly @entity6 ’s imagination running wild			0
' with no real world restrictions , @entity6 ’s mind is able to dream up scenarios of him and his family in fantasies involving him winning a @entity112 , his father fighting his boss for buried @entity116 treasure , his wife getting breast implants , his infant daughter saving him from drowning , etc. ' creator of @entity3 , @entity122 , who is typically quite vocal about his show , is yet to comment on the theory , the @entity120 reported .			2

theory claims @entity6 never awoke from a coma he fell into in april 1993
an episode six months earlier said he was *destined* to die
every episode since is a figment of his imagination
the show became more outlandish following the coma , theory says
