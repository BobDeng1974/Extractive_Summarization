by @entity0 the @entity2 candidate who could push the @entity3 into third place in a by - election this week is being backed by a bizarre figure who calls himself ‘ @entity9 ’ and once appeared in a pornographic film			1

connection : @entity2 hopeful @entity10 , left , whom some say could come second in an upcoming by - election , was nominated to stand by @entity15 , right , who once played a tv character named lord lust the disclosures suggest that @entity2 leader @entity29 is still struggling to fulfil his promise to weed out the ‘ @entity32 ’ characters among his ranks - such as councillor @entity34 , who blamed this winter ’s flooding on the government ’s decision to legalise gay marriage			1
mr @entity15 , who has been described as ‘ a cad , womaniser and bon vivant ’ , purchased the title of @entity44 of @entity45 in the 1990s			1
he went on to host a late - night adult programme called lord @entity47 , in which he was surrounded by barely clothed models , before appearing in @entity50			1
erotic links : mr @entity10 was involved in distributing the film version of @entity53 , pictured here in book form publicity material for the film said : ‘ the country estate of lord @entity9 is jam - packed with nude lovelies indulging in gentrified hanky panky , from @entity61 the poacher to vicky the portrait painter			1

’ the company went into liquidation in 2009 , owing more than £ 450,000			0
@entity2 ’s central policy is that @entity85 should withdraw from the @entity71			0
shortly after mr @entity10 was named as the party ’s candidate he said : ‘ @entity89 has outsourced the running of this country to the @entity71			2
@entity12 and the @entity92 have subjugated - by stealth - control of this country to the @entity71 and its quangos			0
’ the by - election , which follows the death of @entity12 mp @entity98 , is the first major electoral test of 2014 for @entity2			1
the party is hoping a strong showing - followed by a good result in may ’s @entity103 elections - will act as a springboard for next year ’s general election			0
strategy : mr @entity10 on the campaign trail in @entity14 , @entity108 , with @entity2 leader @entity29 , right a poll last week showed @entity12 heading for first place in the by - election with 61 points , with @entity2 second on 15 points - up 12 points since the 2010 election			1
it means the party is set to leapfrog the conservatives and the @entity120			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ @entity15 presented a programme called lord @entity9 ’s lovelies which was a @entity125 / @entity124 production on mainstream tv			0
