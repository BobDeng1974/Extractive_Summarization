by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 8 june 2012 updated : 10:18 est , 8 june 2012 @entity2 home furnishings giant @entity1 hired translators to check the names of 9,000 of its products - to make sure they did n't mean something rude in @entity8			1
the @entity9 reports that the retail chain spent nearly four years on the project to spare the blushes of its @entity14 clients			2
embarrasing : @entity1 hired a team of linguists to check their catalog to make sure their home furnishings did n't mean something rude in @entity8 the @entity9 found that ' @entity21 ' the name of an @entity1 bed , ' sounds uncomfortably close to getting to third base in @entity8 , ' and ' @entity25 ' - a grey plant pot - ' could sound like slang for sex '			1
after realising the embarrassing blunder @entity1 hired a team of linguists to make sure that items from its catalog are appropriate when translated from @entity2 to @entity8			1
confectionery retailer @entity35 on the other hand did n't seem to have the same due diligence when researching @entity38 , the new name for its global snack foods brand			2
and were left rather red faced when it emerged that the word sounded like oral sex in @entity44			1
@entity1 was founded in 1943 in @entity2 by 17 - year - old @entity45			1
the first @entity47 store opened in 1987 and @entity48 fell in love with its reasonably priced home furnishings and ready - to - assemble furniture			0
hailed as the world 's most successful mass - market retailer the chain now has 230 stores in 33 countries and hosts a whopping 410 million shoppers per year			0
but although it 's easy to see the appeal of not many would go as far as @entity62 and @entity61 who got married at their local branch this year			0
two years after they met at the store in @entity68 , @entity69 , the happy couple decided their favourite shop was the perfect venue their nuptials			0
bizarrely the racy translation did n't deter shareholders , who last month voted overwhelmingly to adopt the name			0
other companies have learned the hard way to take precautions			0
according to the @entity82 luxury car manufacturer @entity80 once described a car as being available in the color ' rape yellow			0
' the mixup was the result of a @entity88 to @entity90 translation error of ' rapeseed plant			2
' similarly , according to the @entity93 , @entity92 was forced to change the name of the @entity96 sedan in @entity97 when it came to light that ' lacrosse ' is slang for masturbation in @entity101 in @entity102 , ' vicks ' can be a term for sex , so @entity107 cough drops are called @entity108 in @entity102 , according to the @entity109 .			1

linguists found that ' @entity114 ' , the name of an @entity1 bed , sounded uncomfortably close to getting to third base in @entity8
and ' @entity117 ' , a grey plant pot , ' could sound like slang for sex '
