birdwatchers everywhere are in a bit of a flap			0
a photograph of a bird with a visible egg inside its body has been taken for what is believed to be the first time ever			2
a team of experts had visited a remote @entity12 tropical island to study the critically endangered @entity13			1
a photograph of a bird with a visible egg inside its body has been taken for what is believed to be the first time ever			2
the critically endangered @entity13 was being studied by scientists at @entity19 in the @entity12 when the amazing picture was taken unlike land birds , some sea - birds have feathers which hug their body more to stop them getting wet - thus making the bump better defined ( left )			1
pictured right , a file photo of the rare @entity13 @entity29 is known about the elusive sea - bird - but what the researchers came back with is an image of a clearly gravid ( ie egg - carrying ) member of the species in flight			1
the picture showing the obvious egg bump has given researchers fresh insight into the timing of the petrel 's breeding season on @entity19 , the bird 's only known habitat			1
the discovery was described in the latest bulletin of the @entity48			0
' against the background of a pinkish - orange sunset , with @entity19 in the distance , i spotted a petrel through my camera 's viewfinder			1
' almost immediately i saw the outline of an egg , a huge bump at its belly			2
i called out to the other expedition members - " she has an egg , she has an egg ... " ' , said author @entity60			1
' she flew close to the boat which gave me the unique chance to photograph her just before the sun set			0
' it was a magical moment , and to think that in less than an hour she would probably lay her egg and contribute to the future survival of this threatened species			0

but it was only due to a series of coincidences that the image came to light			0
unlike land birds , some sea - birds have feathers which hug their body more to stop them getting wet - thus making the bump better defined			0
furthermore , the petrel was in flight - making it even easier to spot			0
and finally , it also helped that the petrel 's eggs are ' disproportionately huge '			0
most extraordinary of all is the fact the picture was of an extremely rare bird - something which has astonished @entity105 , the conservation group that released the picture and compiles the official red list of endangered birds .			2

@entity110 photographed @entity13 off @entity19 in @entity12 while it was in flight
equally *remarkable* is the fact that unique photo is of a critically endangered bird
on catching image on camera , photographer *exclaimed* : ' she has an egg ... she has an egg ! '
