by @entity0 published : 08:05 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 08:07 est , 6 september 2013 an interactive map of the @entity3 coast devastated by a huge tsunami in march 2011 has been launched that lets web users tour the dilapidated areas			1
the photographs on @entity10 's @entity9 are a chilling reminder of the massive earthquake that rocked the area and triggered the tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people and caused a meltdown at the @entity17 nuclear power plant			1
the images that make up @entity10 's ' @entity20 ' project include photographs of towns and villages near the stricken power plant where high radiation levels have left people unable to return to their homes , as well as memories of happier times before the earthquake struck			1
the photographs on @entity10 's @entity9 , are a chilling reminder of the massive earthquake that rocked the area and triggered the tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people and caused a meltdown at the @entity17 nuclear power plant			1
this is the remains of a shopping complex the images include photographs of towns and villages near the stricken power plant where high radiation levels have left people unable to return to their homes , as well as memories of happier times before the earthquake struck - including this shopping street some villages snapped show rebuilding is under way , while others illustrate nature reclaiming shells of broken buildings			1
thanks to timing options on the interactive map , users can explore the region before the disaster and afterwards , to compare photos and really understand the devastation caused			0
@entity10 has mapped the largely deserted streets of 12 towns and villages including @entity57 and @entity58 in the region where the power station is situated			1
the images are part of a project named ' @entity64 ' which pins photographs and videos of local landmarks taken by the general public to the appropriate locations on the map			1
more than 18,000 people lost their lives when the 9.0 magnitude sub-sea earthquake sent an enormous wave crashing into @entity3 's northeast coast			2
here a boat lies in the middle of a road the catastrophic natural event broke the cooling systems of the coastal nuclear power station , sending the reactors into meltdown and causing thousands of local people to flee the area , as well as global panic			2
this is the same road before the tsunami interested web users can tour evacuation zones from the safety of their own homes , including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99			0
the images of the streets were taken as late as august this year , according to a @entity10 spokesman in @entity3 and can be seen at : @entity103 / they are part of a project named ' @entity64 ' which pins photographs and videos of local landmarks taken by the general public to the appropriate locations on the map			1

this building was a busy hospital interested web users can tour evacuation zones from the safety of their own homes , including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99			0
this is the same hospital before the tsunami in march , @entity10 released panoramic views of @entity127 , a town at the heart of the original 20 - kilometre exclusion zone around the blighted power plant			2

this road has been turned into scrub land by the natural catastrophe before the tsunami the same road used to be part of a leafy residential area			0
@entity10 has mapped the largely deserted streets of 12 towns and villages including @entity57 and @entity58 in the region where the power station is situated so far no - one has officially died as a result of radiation sickness cause by the nuclear meltdown , but experts believe that some areas close to the power station will be contaminated for decades			1
currently , residents are allowed to return to certain parts of the outer exclusion zone but are not allowed to stay overnight , to minimise their exposure to radiation , @entity170 reported			0
teams of workers have the unenviable job of scraping the top layer of soil and grass into bags to remove some radiation as part of a government - funded operation that will cost over Â£ 1bn by the end of this financial year			0
it is thought around 8,000 people are working on the clean - up operation in the region every day and now only wear gloves and a face mask instead of a full protection suit , which they would have donned a year ago			0

some redevelopment seems to be taking place in this photo but the same area was much more built up before			0
