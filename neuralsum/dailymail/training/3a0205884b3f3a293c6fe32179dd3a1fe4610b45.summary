by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 20 november 2013 immigration minister @entity1 sought to allay fears about the scale of the influx from @entity5 and @entity6 in the @entity7 @entity8 will not face a flood of migrants from @entity6 and @entity5 when border controls lapse in the @entity7 , the immigration minister insisted last night			1
@entity1 played down fears of a mass influx from the @entity15 countries and ruled out extending the restrictions on migrant workers			1
ministers have come under pressure from @entity21 backbenchers to defy the @entity22 and protect @entity8 jobs by keeping controls in place			1
currently , @entity6 and @entity5 can only work in the @entity8 on seasonal fruit - picking visas or if they are self - employed			2
from january , they will have the same working rights as @entity8			1
mr @entity1 said extending the restrictions from when they expire on @entity29 was ‘ not legally possible ’ because it would be overturned in court			1
however , he insisted he was ‘ not complacent ’ about potential problems and pointed to measures to limit migrants ’ access to social housing and benefits			0
‘ you wo n’t see people just being able to turn up and get access to social housing five minutes after they arrive , which is one of the things that drives people up the wall , ’ he said at a press conference			0
he rejected comparisons between next year ’s changes and 2004 , when @entity47 opened up the borders to eight @entity15 countries , including @entity50			1
officials predicted that just 13,000 migrants would come to @entity8 every year , but more than a million have arrived			2
controls : @entity55 officials evict @entity6 migrants			0
in 2007 , when the country joined the @entity22 , ' transitional controls ' were applied which meant migrants must have a job offer in order to cross the border mr @entity1 said there was a ‘ big difference ’ between now and 2004 because eight other @entity22 countries will also be forced to drop restrictions on january 1			1
he said migrants would be lured to @entity68 by jobs and to other countries with larger @entity6 and @entity5 populations			0
‘ in 2004 , we were the only major country not to have transitional controls , ’ he said			2
‘ all the other big countries did , so anyone that wanted to come to work somewhere legally came to the @entity8 which is why we had such a significant number of people			2
’ last week , former home secretary @entity80 said dropping border controls in 2004 was a ‘ spectacular mistake ’			0
concerns over the likely scale of immigration from the two countries , which have a combined population of 29million , prompted @entity21 backbenchers this week to demand controls be extended			1
@entity90 , the mp for @entity91 , proposed extending them until the end of 2018			0
but mr @entity1 said this would be a breach of @entity22 treaties signed by the last @entity47 government			2
he said : ‘ it simply is n’t legally possible			0
the accession treaties only give us the ability – and the other eight counties with transitional controls – to extend them to the end of the year			0
we ’ve extended the controls to their legal maximum			0
’ mr @entity1 refused to make an official prediction of how many @entity6 and @entity5 would arrive from january , claiming to do so would be a ‘ fool ’s errand ’			1
migration campaigners have predicted 50,000 a year will arrive , blowing a hole in the government ’s pledge to cut net migration to ‘ tens of thousands ’ by 2015 .			0

@entity1 seeks to allay fears about influx of new workers from january
insists immigration will not be like when borders opened to @entity50 in 2004
@entity21 *mps* have called for restrictions on workers to be extended by 5 years
but @entity1 warns it would be thrown out by the @entity8 courts as *illegal*
