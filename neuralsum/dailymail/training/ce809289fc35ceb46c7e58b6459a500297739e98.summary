the comment , apparently delivered with the utmost seriousness , may seem shocking to younger generations but the scars run deep for sir @entity3			1
scars that run deep : the passage of time has clearly done little to quell eccentric astronomer sir @entity3 's deep - seated feelings towards @entity10			1

there may be another war			2
the @entity10 will try again , given another chance			2
a @entity11 is a @entity11 is a @entity11			1
and the only good @entity11 is a dead @entity11			1
‘ a @entity10 general said to me at the end of the war , “ you won two wars			2
you wo n’t win the third			0
and that ’s the economic war			0
” i hope he ’s wrong			0
’ ' no question of anyone else : the astronomer previously told how he was so deeply in love that he entered into a life of bachelorhood after the tragedy outspoken : the presenter of @entity15 made his controversial remarks in an interview for the latest edition of @entity47 magazine he admitted there ‘ can be good , free , honourable , decent @entity10 ’ only to add : ‘ i have n’t met them myself , but i ’m sure they exist			1

stand up for @entity85 ! ’ @entity87 - wearing sir @entity3 , who began presenting @entity15 in 1957 – said he had had ‘ a rather interesting war ’			0
‘ reliable rumours ’ of his derring - do include how as a flight lieutenant he once climbed over the dead bodies of his pilot and co-pilot to land his @entity94 bomber safely			1
