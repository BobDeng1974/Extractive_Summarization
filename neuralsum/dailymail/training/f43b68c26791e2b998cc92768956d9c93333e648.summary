@entity0 , the director of public prosecutions , welcomed the ‘ transparency ’ of filming in court and said it had the potential to allow the public to ‘ see justice being done ’			1
her comments came after senior judges in @entity6 were left divided over the benefits of airing live criminal trials – a debate sparked by the broadcast of the @entity26 trial in @entity27			1
speaking at an event held by the @entity30 at law firm @entity31 in @entity32 , mrs @entity28 told @entity33 : ‘ open justice is about letting the public see justice being done and i can see real benefits of trialling cameras in criminal courts , as long as the right protections and safeguards are in place			1
‘ i am doing a lot of work to improve the court experience of victims and witnesses and where cameras in the courtroom would not disrupt this , or any other aspect of a trial , i would welcome the transparency , and indeed scrutiny , they could bring			1
’ a ban on cameras in courtrooms in @entity9 and @entity10 was introduced in 1925 , although permission was granted last year to show civil and criminal cases at the @entity61			2
the rules in @entity64 courts differ and a murder trial was allowed to be filmed last year after permission had been sought from all participants , including the defendant			1
in comparison , in @entity70 , 38 of the 50 states allow tv cameras into criminal and civil courts , providing that the judge agrees			2
the relaxed rules have allowed millions to watch infamous trials like @entity77 's in 1995			2
sentencing in major trials and criminal appeals , which are heard by senior judges without juries , has the potential for pulling in large audiences			0

prior to the trial , which saw @entity26 jailed for five years for killing his model girlfriend @entity158 , judge @entity156 said it was vital that impoverished @entity27 who feel ill - treated by the justice system be given a first - hand look at the trial			1
' the justice system is still perceived as treating the rich and famous with kid gloves whilst being harsh on the poor and the vulnerable , ' he said			0
' enabling a larger @entity27 society to be able to follow first - hand criminal proceedings which involve a celebrity , so to speak , will go a long way into dispelling these negative and unfounded perceptions			2
' others who have expressed their concerns about @entity6 court cases being televised include the former lord chief justice , lord judge			2
he has previously said filming a sentencing could spark chaos in a courtroom			0
' i 'm very troubled about having cameras just swanning around , ' he said			0
the 71 - year - old has also told how lifting the 90 - year - old filming ban could encourage hecklers to yell abuse or even cheer knowing it will be broadcast across the country			2
he said that while he was ‘ perfectly happy ’ with cameras being taken into court ‘ provided their presence does n't increase the risk that justice wo n't be done ' , he opposed the filming of the actual sentencing			1
‘ i take a very strong view about sentencing , ’ he added			0
a @entity64 murder trial became the first @entity6 criminal court case to be aired live on tv in 90 years			1

cameras have been banned within the precincts of court since 1925 , but @entity211 was granted permission to follow the six - week retrial of @entity214 at the @entity215 in @entity216 in 2012			2
after three years of negotiation , the @entity217 gave the @entity211 documentary team permission to film the judge , lawyers , defendant and witnesses during the high - profile retrial of @entity225 who was accused of killing his wife @entity227			0
the two - hour documentary , called @entity214 , was broadcast on july 9 last year			0
