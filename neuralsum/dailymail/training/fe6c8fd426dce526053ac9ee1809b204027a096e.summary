such was the hype surrounding the trial that it was ordered moved from @entity44 of the @entity46 ' home , to @entity23			0
but @entity20 argued that the trial should have been moved yet again because of the crush of publicity in @entity23			2
' before hearing even a single witness , nearly half of all prospective jurors admitted they had already decided mr. @entity8 was guilty of capital murder , ' @entity20 argues			1
and in what may be a first for the @entity57 system of justice , outside the courthouse in which the parties would try to select a fair jury , a radio station posted a large billboard which had a telephone number for people to call in and vote ' whether @entity8 was a man or monster '			2
