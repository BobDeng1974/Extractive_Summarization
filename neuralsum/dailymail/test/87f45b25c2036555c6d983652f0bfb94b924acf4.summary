@entity0 is eyeing a long - awaited homecoming ahead of his fight against @entity3			1
the @entity5 middleweight takes on @entity6 in @entity7 on saturday night bidding to avoid losing successive fights for the first time in his career			2
and assuming he does so , @entity0 is open to fighting again in @entity12 this july , five years since he last fought in the @entity13			1
@entity0 gets up close to @entity14 during the @entity15 186 weigh - in at @entity16 on friday ‘ i know it ’s a cliche but i feel like i ’m in the best shape of my life			1
i ’m ready to take on the world , and by world i mean @entity3 , ’ he said			2
‘ for me it ’s just another day in the office			2
this is what i love to do , this is what i was put on this earth to do			2
‘ make no mistake , i ’m going to deliver for the fans in @entity7			2
‘ he ’s going to look for a takedown , i ’m going to stop that takedown			2
‘ i ’m in the best training situation of my life – if i had this type of training my entire career , i ’d have been a world champion five years ago			1
i just have to prove to the world i ’m still one of the best			0
i ’ll beat @entity3 , then i ’ll beat someone else and then you ’ll hear me start talking about that title shot again			1
‘ i have n’t fought in the @entity13 in five years			1
after this fight , if the @entity15 wants me to fight on the @entity12 card i ’ll do it			0
i ’ll fight anywhere in the @entity13			1
i ’m an @entity43 at heart and it ’s been far too long since i ’ve been able to fight in the @entity13			1
’ @entity0 looks to get back to winning ways against @entity14 in @entity47 this weekend @entity0 is coming off the back of a defeat by @entity50 last november but still considers himself among the best in the world			1
‘ i ’m expecting the best @entity3 there is , and i expect him to be confident			0
but his courage will diminish as the fight goes on , and i will knock him out , ’ he added			0
‘ @entity3 is a very good athlete			0
he ’s a great wrestler , he ’s a mediocre striker – i ’m by far a better striker			0
‘ i ’ve never lost two fights back to back			1
i need to put a win streak together			1
but i still consider myself one of the best in the world			0
‘ the last fight against @entity62 , we clashed heads and i could n’t see too well – he caught me with a head kick and that was it			0
‘ i know i ’ve had my setbacks , they ’ve been well documented			0
there ’s no shame in losing to the guys i ’ve lost to ; they ’re all guys who could be world champions			0
@entity74 called me after the @entity50 fight and told me the reason i was losing fights is because i ’m consistently fighting the best guys in the world – not everyone can say that			0
‘ i ’m going to prove that i ’m still one of the best in the world			0
