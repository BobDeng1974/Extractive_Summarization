@entity0 performed well in varying circumstances in this intriguing battle ; there was not so much to do in the first half but the opposite in the second period			1
he used his experience and common sense whenever he could to ensure that his was a positive influence on the game and did well not to let the emotion of the crowd influence his decision making			0
the biggest call of the game was the clearest – once it became clear that both @entity0 and his assistant had seen @entity17 ’s stamp on @entity18 there could only be one outcome			1
@entity17 ca n't believe it after being sent off for a reckless stamp on @entity23 's @entity18 at @entity24 @entity25 ( top ) was on the receiving end of @entity17 's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch here is the stamp from @entity17 on @entity18 after both players had competed for the ball @entity17 accepted the decision to send him off after he had only been on the field for just over 30 seconds in a post-match interview			1
@entity0 did not let @entity18 escape as he cautioned him for the late challenge which provoked @entity17 ’s retaliation			1
@entity0 was always going to come under pressure from @entity41 players and fans to ‘ level things up ’ and there were opportunities to do that the most notable 10 minutes later when @entity46 mistimed a strong challenge on @entity48			1
the incident was merely a poorly timed tackle and i thought that a yellow card was appropriate but @entity46 could just have easily seen red			0
late in the game @entity41 fans screamed for @entity55 to be sanctioned when he caught @entity56 but he had been blocked off by @entity57 and that caused the collision			2
@entity41 could easily have lost a second player at the very end of the game when @entity57 followed through on @entity62 but @entity0 showed a consistent approach and let the game end in a deserved away win			2
@entity65 1990 at 10 seconds , believed to be the fastest red card in professional football			2

@entity23 's @entity83 is sent from the pitch after receiving a red card			0
@entity92 player @entity91 saw red for foul language after just two seconds in a @entity96 game in 2000			0
after the referee blew his whistle , @entity91 said : ‘ f * * * me , that was loud ’ and was promptly sent off			0
@entity17 clearly puts all his downwards force into @entity18 's right leg after the pair collided @entity17 is shown the red card by referee @entity0 after just 38 seconds of the second - half @entity17 flings back the captain 's armband towards his team - mates having been sent off at @entity24 a stunned @entity17 walks off the @entity24 pitch having been shown a straight red card for a stamp on @entity18			1
