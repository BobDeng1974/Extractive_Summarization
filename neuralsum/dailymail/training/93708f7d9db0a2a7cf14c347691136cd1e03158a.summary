president @entity0 will make the economic recovery a focal point of his @entity3 , touting his administration 's successes , while pressuring @entity6 to enact the types of reforms he believes will further buoy the middle class			1
the jan. 20 speech is expected to be less depressed in tone than the one he gave during the last joint session of @entity6 , @entity0 advisers who spoke to @entity11 indicated , and will put on a pedestal the headway the country has made in the past six years in the face of unfavorable economic winds			1
' you ca n’t convince people that their paycheck is going farther than it was -- and you should n’t try			0
that would be a big mistake			0
what you can do is try to affect people ’s optimism for the long term , ' a senior @entity0 adviser told the publication			1
president @entity0 is expected in his annual @entity3 address to put on a pedestal the headway the country has made in the past six years in the face of unfavorable economic winds			1
he is pictured here during his 2014 speech to a joint session of @entity6 ' if we can make people understand that there are reasons for a bright future and the president has a plan to address what ails them , then that will be real progress , ' the aide added			1
early drafts of the annual speech , traditionally given at the request of @entity6 in late january , draw inspiration from remarks the president made a month before the midterm elections at @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , speechwriters signaled			1
mostly lost to memory in the wake of a distracting line about @entity0 policies being on the ballot in november - a statement that haunted @entity69 throughout the rest of the general election - the remarks cast a rose - colored light on @entity74 's recent prosperity and the administration that oversaw the fruition of this ' new foundation			1
' ' sometimes the noise clutters and i think confuses the nature of the reality out there , ' @entity0 said			2
' here are the facts : when i took office , businesses were laying off 800,000 @entity74 a month			0
today , our businesses are hiring 200,000 @entity74 a month , ' he said , reminding the audience that the unemployment rate has decreased by nearly four percent since 2009			0
continuing , @entity0 stated that ' over the past four and a half years , our businesses have created 10 million new jobs ; this is the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job creation in our history			1
' right now , there are more job openings than at any time since 2001			0
all told , the @entity74 has put more people back to work than @entity100 , @entity101 , and every other advanced economy combined			1
' this progress has been hard , but it has been steady and it has been real			0
and it ’s the direct result of the @entity74 people ’s drive and their determination and their resilience , and it ’s also the result of sound decisions made by my administration , ' he contended			1
perceptions to the contrary are not based on the facts , @entity0 argued			2
' it is indisputable that our economy is stronger today than when i took office			1
by every economic measure , we are better off now than we were when i took office			0
' at the same time , it ’s also indisputable that millions of @entity74 do n’t yet feel enough of the benefits of a growing economy where it matters most -- and that 's in their own lives , ' he stated			2
the president acknowledged that ' it ’s still harder than it should be to pay the bills and to put away some money ' for many @entity74			1
' even when you ’re working your tail off , it ’s harder than it should be to get ahead , ' he said			0
average @entity74 families have n't increased their take home pay in nearly two decades , he said , which ' means it ’s harder for middle - class @entity74 to climb the ladder of success			2
it means that it ’s harder for poor @entity74 to grab hold of the ladder into the middle class			0
' ' that ’s not what @entity74 is supposed to be about			0
it offends the very essence of who we are , ' @entity0 said			2
' because if being an @entity74 means anything , it means we believe that even if we ’re born with nothing -- regardless of our circumstances , a last name , whether we were wealthy , whether our parents were advantaged -- no matter what our circumstances , with hard work we can change our lives , and then our kids can too			0
' this year 's speech , scheduled for january 20 , is expected to be less depressed in tone than the one he gave last year			1
the president will ' try to affect people ’s optimism for the long term , ' a senior @entity0 adviser said back in his hometown for the remarks , @entity0 too returned back to the message that propelled @entity69 to success in the 2012 presidential election and concurring congressional elections - economic ' fairness			1
' ' our economy can not truly succeed if we ’re stuck in a winner - take - all system where a shrinking few do very well while a growing many are struggling to get by , ' he told the audience			0
' historically , our economic greatness rests on a simple principle : when the middle class thrives , and when people can work hard to get into the middle class , then @entity74 thrives			2
and when it does n’t , @entity74 does n't			0
' the president also used the economic thread to make the case for another one of his signature achievements : health care reform			1
' health care has long been the single biggest driver of @entity74 ’s future deficits			2
it ’s been the single biggest driver of our debt			0
health care is now the single biggest factor driving down those deficits , ' he claimed			0
the @entity211 , @entity0 said , is a ' game - changer for the fourth cornerstone of this new foundation ' his administration is building for @entity74			2
' @entity74 is better poised to lead and succeed in the 21st century than any other nation on @entity216			0
we ’ve got the best cards , ' the president said			0
' and i will not allow anyone to dismantle this foundation			0
because for the first time , we can see real , tangible evidence of what the contours of the new economy will look like			0
' @entity0 is expected to bring back to the forefront of the political debate several policies his administration has long said would set @entity74 's economy on solid long - term footing , including new investments in infrastructure , research , early childhood education and clean energy technology			1
the president will also press @entity6 to take up tax reforms that prevent corporate inversions , legislation to make it easier for first - time home buyers to obtain a loan , equal pay for equal work , paid family leave and a minimum wage increase			1
if the @entity74 makes ' high - quality preschool available to every child , not only will we give our kids a safe place to learn and grow while their parents go to work , we ’ll give them the start that they need to succeed in school , and earn higher wages , and form more stable families of their own , ' @entity0 has said			1
in the @entity3 he will likely recommit to a plan to enroll 6 million children early education programs by the end of the decade			2
he 's also anticipated to touch on higher education and the need for reforms that make it easier for graduates to pay off their student loans			1
changes to the loan process will ' help a whole lot of young people breathe easier and feel freer to take the jobs they really want , ' @entity0 told attendees of his @entity59 speech			1
president @entity0 's @entity3 address will draw its inspiration from an overlooked speech he gave at @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , a month before the midterm elections another issue that is certain to come up in his address is immigration reform			1
although the president used executive action to protect as many as 5 million illegal immigrants last month , he has continued to advocate for permanent , legislative changes to the immigration system that would provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal residents			0
framing it as an economic boon , @entity0 has said comprehensive immigration reform will ' grow our economy , shrink our deficits , secure our borders			1
' @entity0 could also use the address to lecture @entity304 in a symbolic gesture aimed at his base			2
the $ 1.1 trillion spending bill passed by @entity6 and signed by the president last week that funds the federal government , with the exception of @entity312 , through the end of fiscal year 2015 contained a provision that would weaken restrictions on @entity304 enacted in 2010 as part of @entity317			1
the progressive wing of the party , led by @entity321 sen. @entity320 , attempted to derail the bill over the provision , pitting the @entity69 lawmakers against the @entity325 , which came out in support of the massive appropriations legislation			0
in order to make nice with the caucus , @entity0 may take a strong stance in favor of financial reforms that aim to rein in big banks and prevent future taxpayer - funded bailouts			1
@entity335 have resisted the @entity0 administrations efforts to slap new rules on businesses that they believe would hurt the job growth rather than help it such as a federal minimum wage increase and paid family leave			1
but the president could find a partner in the @entity335 , which will become the majority party in both legislative chambers next month , on less divisive issues like tax reform and other measures to rehabilitate the economy			2
' if [ @entity0 's ] willing to explain that , which he says he ’s for , that would be great			2
because there will be plenty of @entity69 saying the opposite , ' @entity356 sen. @entity355 told @entity11			0
' without his help , particularly with @entity69 , it will be difficult to move that agenda that he says he ’s for			0
' in the last legislative session @entity366 say they passed more than 40 bills aimed at creating jobs and boosting the economy - almost all of which died in the @entity370 controlled @entity371			0
they plan to introduce similar legislation in the first six weeks of the year as part of their ' @entity6 ' initiative			2
@entity355 said that @entity0 will have to walk the walk rather than just talk the talk if he wants @entity377 - and @entity335 - in @entity6 to adopt his priority list			1
' he has every right to go out and talk about his message			0
but he ought to spend more time up here , working with @entity69 and @entity335 alike on passing items that will actually help improve the wages of middle class @entity74 and provide more opportunity for growth in the economy , ' @entity355 said .			0

the president will ' try to affect people ’s optimism for the long term , ' a senior @entity0 adviser said
@entity0 is expected to make the case that the economy ' is stronger today ' than when he took office six years *ago* , and the country is ' better off now '
he will likely bring back to the forefront requests for new investments in infrastructure , research , early childhood education and clean energy
he may also press @entity6 to take up tax reforms that prevent corporate inversions , equal pay for equal work , paid family leave and a minimum wage increase
@entity0 is scheduled to make his remarks before @entity6 on jan. 20
