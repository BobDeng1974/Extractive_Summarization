a fish and chip shop in @entity1 has been threatened with a $ 20,000 fine , simply for having a sign in its window letting people know they are open for business			1
@entity6 in @entity7 - located about 15 minutes from @entity9 's city centre - was issued with a number of warnings for the sign which has been in the front window for 13 years			1
owner @entity14 said he is ' flabbergasted ' at why his small business has been targeted over the light - up ' open ' sign , when ' all we ’re doing is advertising that we ’re open			1
' feathers @entity21 in @entity7 , @entity1 , could face a $ 22,000 fine over a sign in their window the ' open ' sign lights are not allowed and if turned on again could cost owner @entity14 a lot of money ' there ’s a lot of things around that can distract people ; there are roadwork signs that flash brighter than that ' , he told @entity35			1
mr @entity14 first received notice of the council 's issue with the sign last october , when a letter arrived in the mail threatening him with a hefty fine should he continue to turn the sign on			2
owner @entity14 said he does n't see how he 's doing anything wrong by letting people know he 's open ' after that i spoke to the council and i said to them look i received your letter i ’m flabbergasted to why we 've been issued this , ' he said			1
‘ you ca n’t tell me that in 13 years , 365 days in a year ( and ) i 've never received a letter about it until now , ' he continued			2
the second blow came when he shop owner was in hospital with family the day his mother passed away			0
a staff member was running the shop that day and accidentally lit the sign up			0
a council member saw it on , snapped a photo of it and soon after mr @entity14 was issued with a $ 750 fine			2
however that fine was later waived , but the issue continued to ' snowball from there '			0
@entity73 senator @entity72 had also expressed his outrage at the ' bureaucratic madness '			1
he was due to hold a press conference on the issue , but the people he had hired to provide signs for the event got spooked and pulled out amid fears they would also be targeted by the council			0
' this is a case of red tape madness , ' senator @entity72 told @entity35			1
' this is mindless , petty red tape that is actually killing jobs and making it very hard for small businesses to survive			2
independent @entity73 senator @entity72 described the ordeal as a targeted attack on small businesses ' why do councils do this ? ‘ because they can , ' he added			1
mr @entity72 urged others to come forward with similar cases , saying that such instances are ' taking our country 's economy backwards			0
' ' local governments deserve to be a laughing stock for trying to enforce these sorts of regulations , ' he said , before adding that the whole situation is ' absurd '			0
potentially facing a $ 20,000 fine should the @entity107 sign be switched on again , mr @entity14 described the ordeal as ' revenue raising ' and said he had been unfairly targeted as a small business owner			1
mr @entity14 described the ordeal as ' revenue raising ' ' all i 'm doing is letting people know i 'm open ' , he said			0
' it ’s not an eyesore , you really have to look for it to see it			0
' i just think that it ’s not fair			0
' surely in this day and age we have better things to worry about than little signs , ' mr @entity14 added .			0

@entity6 has been threatened with a $ 20,000 fine
owner @entity14 said it was for the light - up open sign in the window
