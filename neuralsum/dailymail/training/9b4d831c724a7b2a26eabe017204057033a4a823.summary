by @entity0 it 's about the size of a simple two - bedroom apartment , only without any windows , refrigeration , plants or , most importantly , the ability to venture outside without a space suit			2
and six researchers who have been living in a @entity11 simulation for the last four months in @entity12 have been able to finally leave the solar - powered dome and return to the real world			1
the research mission on the @entity17 volcano ended 120 days of the @entity19 exploration as part of the second @entity22 mission , known as @entity23 , according to @entity24			1
the 1,000 - square - foot mock planet station features a kitchen , dining room , bathroom , lab and exercise space , as well as six small bedrooms			1
free at last : members of a mock @entity11 mission celebrate their return to the real world on saturday after four months inside this pod in @entity12 simulation : the landscape of the @entity17 volcano in @entity12 are similar - if only physically - to the conditions of @entity11 the 1,000 - square - foot solar - powered dome was created as a test to see how well astronauts could live on @entity11 for an extended amount of time the pod features a research lab , dining room , kitchen , exercise space and single bedrooms ' i have n't seen a tree , smelled the train , heard a bird , or felt wind on my skin in four months , ' @entity53 leader @entity52 posted on his @entity61 account			1
perhaps what the team were most excited about however was real food			0
they have been living off dehydrated meals for the entire mission			2
' it 's really great to taste fresh fruit and vegetables again , ' @entity52 told @entity24			0
' the main purpose of the project is to learn about the problems that might occur to crew members if they went to @entity11 ' @entity75 , principal investigator of the project , told @entity24			2
another major part of the process was learning to handle conflicts , depression and anxiety in a confined space , as astronauts would have to constantly do			0
' it 's not like if you have a problem with someone , you can go out for a run in a park on @entity11 , ' @entity75 said			0
' you have to get along with each other in a very small space			0
' @entity92 was run by the @entity93 at @entity94 and funded by @entity96 's @entity95 man on @entity11 : the team would stage mock space walks as part of the mission surprisingly , @entity52 said everyone got along fairly well			1
' there were n't really altercations among the crew , ' @entity52 said			0
' but even in a family vacation , you disagree with someone over something			0
' the astronauts would only venture outside in mock space suits and would treat the expedition as if they were actually on @entity11			2
@entity23 is a test to see what life would be like on @entity11 for astronauts staying on the planet for an extended period of time			2
the team entered the dome on march 28			1
preparation : this picture shows crews working to construct the dome last year @entity92 is run by the @entity93 at @entity94 and funded by @entity96 's @entity95			1
the first mission finished up after a 118 - day stint in august last year			0
@entity11 is the main long - term goal of @entity96 's human spaceflight program , according to @entity129			1
the agency aims to get astronauts to the vicinity of the @entity133 by the mid- 2030s .			0

team entered the 1,000 - square - foot solar - powered dome on @entity17 volcano in @entity12 on march 28
mock mission is a test to see how astronauts would fare living on @entity11
pod has single rooms , kitchen , lab and exercise space
explorers lived off dehydrated food and stages fake space walks
@entity11 is the main long - term goal of @entity96 's human spaceflight program
