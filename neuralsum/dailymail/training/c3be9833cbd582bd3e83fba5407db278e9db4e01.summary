by @entity0 published : 18:34 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 18:41 est , 31 july 2013 the plight of a middle - aged stroke victim who wants a nurse to help him die threw the controversial laws on suicide into fresh turmoil yesterday			1
appeal judges decided that the 48 - year - old victim , known only as @entity9 , should be given new guidelines on whether a nurse who helps him end his life will be prosecuted for assisted suicide			1
the decision means that for the second time in four years the @entity15 has been instructed by judges to draw up rules on who will and who will not be charged with helping a suicide , a crime that can bring a jail sentence of 14 years			1
ruling : the case of the 48 - year - old , known only as @entity9 , was one of three right - to - die hearings at the @entity27 in central @entity28 ( pictured ) the @entity27 ruling was immediately challenged by the @entity15 , @entity30			1
mr @entity30 , who is to step down as head of the @entity32 in the autumn , called for a final ruling from the higher @entity35 before he produces new guidelines			1
and it was also condemned in a ringing dissenting opinion by the most senior of the three judges who heard @entity9 's case			1
lord chief justice lord judge , the head of the judiciary in @entity44 and @entity45 , broke with his two colleagues and said the @entity15 should not be given powers to reform the law on his own			0
the @entity9 ruling was one of three cases of desperately disabled individuals who hope to die decided by the @entity27 yesterday			1
in a second case , 57 - year - old road accident victim @entity53 was told that no doctor will be allowed to help him take his own life at home			0
decision : lord chief justice lord judge , the head of the judiciary in @entity44 and @entity45 , broke with his two colleagues and said the @entity15 should not be given powers to reform the law on his own lord judge , sitting with master of the @entity63 and @entity64 , also denied the pleas of the family of locked - in syndrome sufferer @entity67 that human rights law means he should have been entitled to help to die			2
' i think it would be sensible for the @entity32 , if possible , to have the benefit of the views of the @entity35 before any amendments are made to the @entity15 's guidelines in this important and sensitive area of the law ' @entity30 , @entity15 mr @entity67 died last summer at the age of 58 before his request came to the @entity80			2
his death came after he refused to take food and drink shortly after losing a first @entity85 case last summer , and his wife @entity86 has been allowed to pursue his claim			0
the judges said that it is for @entity90 to make the law on assisted suicide			0
but in the @entity9 case two of the judges overruled lord judge and said he was right to ask for ' clearer guidance ' from the dpp on whether a nurse or doctor brought in to help him will face prosecution			2
@entity9 suffered a brainstem stroke five years ago which left him almost entirely unable to move and without the ability to speak			1
died last summer : lord judge also denied the pleas of the family of locked - in syndrome sufferer @entity67 ( pictured ) that human rights law means he should have been entitled to help to die he communicates by moving his head and eyes , and by staring at a computer which can detect when he looks at a letter or number , a process described by the judges as ' painfully slow '			2
instructed to draw up rules : the @entity27 ruling was immediately challenged by the @entity15 , @entity30 @entity63 and @entity64 said : ' he finds his life and his condition to be undignified , distressing and intolerable			1
' they said @entity9 had tried to dehydrate and starve himself to death , but ' his attempt failed in the most distressing circumstances			0
' his alternative , the judges said , was to travel to the @entity124 suicide clinic in @entity125			0
but , they said , @entity9 's wife , who is a nurse , does not want to help him die and will not help him travel to @entity128			2
he therefore needs to find someone else to help him , and the @entity15 should give clearer guidance on whether that person will be prosecuted			0
mr @entity30 drew up guidelines in 2010 on the instructions of the courts			0
these say that an assisted suicide prosecution is more likely if a medical professional helps in the death			0
the @entity15 said yesterday : ' while i respect the carefully considered judgment of the @entity27 , i think it would be sensible for the @entity32 , if possible , to have the benefit of the views of the @entity35 before any amendments are made to the @entity15 's guidelines in this important and sensitive area of the law			1
' lord judge said in his dissenting opinion : ' prosecutorial guidance is in danger of expanding into a method of law reform which is outside the proper ambit of the @entity15 's responsibilities			0
' he said that prosecution guidelines could be applied so that people who should in law be prosecuted escape without criminal charges .			0

case of ' @entity9 ' was one of three right - to - die hearings at @entity27
judges instructed @entity15 to draw up rules on charges for assisting suicide
challenged by @entity15 who calls for final ruling from higher @entity35
@entity9 left unable to move and without speech after stroke five years ago
