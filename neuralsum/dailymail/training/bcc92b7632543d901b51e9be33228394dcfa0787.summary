by @entity0 published : 03:23 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 03:23 est , 21 october 2013 thousands of children as young as eight years old have been caught with alcohol by police , highlighting the disturbing problem of child binge drinking			1
police in @entity7 , @entity8 , have stopped more than 2,000 youngsters for drinking alcohol on the streets and in parks while others , including a 10 - year - old boy , were admitted to casualty because of alcohol consumption			1
in a photo released by the force , officers are shown standing next to a haul of 280 litres of alcohol , the equivalent of 492 pints , which was seized by underage drinkers during a three - month operation			1
young drinkers : @entity27 seized 266 litres of beer and cider and 13 litres of spirits from 2,000 children as young as eight years old @entity8 police said that the eight year old boy who was stopped by the police was issued with a ' protecting vulnerable people ' referral			1
from july to september this year , 266 litres of beer and cider and 14 litres of spirits were confiscated from children found in possession of alcohol			1
in the three month period , 2,193 youngsters were spoken to , 154 licensed premises were visited , 76 youth referrals were issued , 54 young people were taken home by police , 23 youths were collected by their parents , six arrests were made , five cannabis warnings were handed out , seven fixed penalty notices were given and there were also two directions to leave issued			0
the operation was mounted after figures revealed 184 children had been admitted to hospital in @entity7 and neighbouring @entity58 for alcohol - related problems in the last three years			1
officers from the @entity61 worked alongside local neighbourhood policing teams in a bid to combat anti-social behaviour by targeting underage and vulnerable youths drinking alcohol			2
problem : @entity58 where children have been taken to casualty after they had been drinking @entity71 councillor @entity70 , @entity72 ’s executive member for community services , said : ' the amount of alcohol seized from children in this operation is worrying and makes you wonder where they get it from			1
' residents across our borough are suffering from anti-social behaviour fuelled by alcohol and they will be glad to see operations like this taking place to tackle the problem			0
' @entity72 will continue to work with the police and other partners to deal with the issues surrounding underage drinking but we need support from parents and other adults , and shops that sell alcohol , to prevent it getting into the hands of children in the first place			2
' specials inspector @entity103 , of @entity27 said : ' underage drinking is something that we will continue to tackle through the @entity107 operation and i am happy that we have managed to confiscate such a large amount of alcohol that could have been drank by underage teens with potentially dangerous consequences			2
treatment : @entity58 , where children had stomach pumped or were admitted because of physical injuries they had suffered as a result of alcohol consumption ' we know that underage drinking can make youngsters very vulnerable and this operation is n’t just about punishing those found to be drinking below the legal age limit , it ’s as much about protecting them from getting into harmful situations and causing a nuisance to other members of the community			1
' i would advise adults and parents not to buy children alcohol as there are all sorts of dangers and risks that come from providing them with it			0
' we will continue to tackle this issue by running the @entity107 initiative			0
' @entity71 councillor @entity144 , @entity145 cabinet member for public protection , said : ' alcohol misuse can present health risks and cause careless behaviour in all age groups , but is even more dangerous for young people			0
' because young people ’s bodies are still growing , alcohol can interfere with their development , making them particularly vulnerable to the long - term damage caused by alcohol			0
' drinking alcohol lowers people ’s inhibitions , and makes them more likely to do things they would n’t normally do			0
young people are particularly at risk because , at their stage of life , they are still testing the boundaries of what is acceptable behaviour			0
' for example , young people may go further than they wanted to in a sexual experience after drinking alcohol			0
in the most serious cases , it could lead to them becoming the victim of a sexual assault			0
' figures released under the @entity179 show 69 under - 18s were admitted to @entity58 or @entity58 hospitals in 2010			2
the figure rose to 71 the following year but last year the figure fell to 44 - although one of the casualties was a 10 - year - old boy			1
these children may have had their stomachs pumped after binge drinking while others suffered physical injuries as a result of alcohol consumption .			2
