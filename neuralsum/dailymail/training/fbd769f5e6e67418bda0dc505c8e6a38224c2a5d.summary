sad : @entity9 , who suffered from a sever form of a condition called placenta accreta , gave birth to a healthy son named @entity15 via @entity16			1
emergency surgery followed , but even a team of 15 doctors could n't save the 34 - year - old bereaved : several fundraisers have already raised over $ 60k for @entity9 's husband @entity36 and their four children left behind are @entity9 's husband @entity36 and their children @entity39 , 7 , @entity42 , 5 , @entity43 , 2 and @entity15			1
just days after @entity9 's death , members of their @entity46 community have already raised over $ 60,000 for the family			1
on just one of several crowdfunding sites set up for the family -- a youcaring page that by sunday evening had raised an impressive $ 59,753 of a goal of $ 100,000 -- @entity9 's aunt @entity54 writes : ' we all said our goodbyes with smiling faces , never imagining it would be the last time we would see her			2
' according to @entity54 , doctors told @entity9 she could deliver @entity15 early -- itself a risky proposition for the baby -- but she refused			1
' being the wonderful strong woman and mother that she was and understanding the personal risk , she chose to wait until 35 weeks when the baby would be strong enough to survive , ' @entity54 writes			2
that decision ultimately cost @entity9 her life , while it potentially saved @entity15 's			2
@entity9 was rushed into surgery following the delivery			0
with placenta accreta , the placental blood vessels grow too deeply into the mother 's uterus and sometimes into surrounding organs			1
giving birth with the condition is usually followed by the removal of the uterus and surgery to stop any hemorrhaging that can occur as the blood vessels are severed			2
in @entity9 's case , the heroic efforts of a team of 15 doctors at @entity87 in @entity88 were unable to save her and she died in surgery			0
life threatening : @entity9 suffered from a condition called placenta accreta in which the blood vessels of the placenta grow too deeply into the uterus , causing life threatening hemorrhaging at childbirth @entity9 knew the risks but chose to carry the baby to term in order to ensure he 'd be born healthy @entity9 died after childbirth because of a serious case of a condition known as placenta accreta , which affects as many as 1 in 533 pregnant women -- and can be fatal in as many as 7 percent of those affected			1
the @entity109 defines placenta accreta as : a serious pregnancy condition that occurs when blood vessels and other parts of the placenta grow too deeply into the uterine wall ... typically , the placenta detaches from the uterine wall after childbirth			1
with placenta accreta , part or all of the placenta remains strongly attached			0
this can cause vaginal bleeding during the third trimester of pregnancy and severe blood loss after delivery			0
it 's also possible for the placenta to invade the muscles of the uterus ( placenta increta ) or grow through the uterine wall ( placenta percreta )			2
if extensive placenta accreta is suspected during pregnancy , you 'll likely need a c - section delivery followed by the surgical removal of your uterus ( hysterectomy )			2
despite the risks , no one expected to lose @entity9			0
' she often mentioned how scared she was , ' her co-worker @entity142 told the @entity143			0
' we always told her to have faith and be positive			0
but we never thought this would be the outcome			0
' and with any such terrible turn of events , the family was left unprepared for the fallout , as @entity9 's aunt @entity54 writes			0
' we never think the worst will happen and do n't plan well enough for something like this			0
@entity9 ’s four children and husband @entity36 need our support , as there is n’t any financial safety net			1
please honor @entity9 by helping support her family in their time of need			0
' @entity9 's aunt @entity54 is helping raise thousands to help out the family			0
the last time she and many others saw the 34 - year - old was at her baby shower ( pictured )			1
' we all said our goodbyes with smiling faces , never imagining it would be the last time we would see her , ' @entity54 said			0

@entity9 , a 34 - year - old @entity3 special ed teacher , died monday after becoming a mother once again to a healthy baby boy , @entity15
@entity9 suffered from a condition called placenta accreta , which causes blood vessels of the placenta to grow too deeply into the uterine wall
she opted to carry @entity15 to 35 weeks rather than deliver him earlier , which would have been safer for her
friends and family have since raised over $ 60,000 using crowd funding to help her husband @entity36 financially as he raises four children alone
