by @entity0 published : 08:22 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 14:56 est , 30 october 2012 the young wife of @entity3 ’s leader has made her first public appearance in two months , bringing to an end what might have been a period of ‘ home detention ’ for being too carefree			2
@entity9 had been photographed earlier this year smiling and strolling about in a casual manner when accompanying her husband @entity11 , the newly appointed leader of the secretive @entity13 state			1
but then she disappeared from view , provoking speculation that she might be pregnant but more likely because she was not presenting the dour image promoted by her husband ’s late father , @entity18			2
the happy couple : @entity3 leader @entity11 walks arm in arm with his wife @entity9 in july , before she her two - month absence analysts say that despite the young @entity18 ’s appointment as supreme commander of the nation , he is still under the control of the military hierarchy who make sure he presents a rigid , authoritative image to the rest of the world			1
that means that his wife must remain aloof and untouchable in the eyes of the masses , say @entity3 experts			0
but now @entity9 is back in the public eye and fuzzy tv pictures from @entity3 show her enjoying the company of her husband at a football match and a musical concert this week			1
according to the official @entity50 news agency , the couple ’s appearance at the concert ‘ drew a thunderous cheer from the audience ’			2
the couple ’s attendance also marked the first public appearance in two weeks by @entity11 himself , raising speculation that he has been receiving behavioural advice from the military hierarchy			1
too cheerful ? analysts think @entity9 was kept at home because she appeared too ' carefree ' @entity65 ’s intelligence agency is convinced that the sudden disappearance of @entity67 from state media since early september is because the nation ’s elders had raised an issue over her casual and cheerful demeanour			1
‘ the analysis has been that there was concern over breach of discipline ( by @entity9 ) among @entity3 elders , plus the speculation of pregnancy , ’ reported @entity65 ’s @entity81 newspaper , quoting the @entity82 which had giving a closed - door briefing to parliament			1
photos taken at the concert showed @entity9 in a long cream coat and what appeared to be a thickening waistline , strengthening speculation that she is pregnant			1
it was also being suggested she had been kept at home as a disciplinary measure because she had been seen in public not displaying a red lapel pin bearing the image , or images , of the two previous leaders			0
all senior @entity3 and any working for the government must wear them			0
dress to impress : high ranking @entity3 must wear the red lapel pins as pictured above a pin is not visible in the latest photos of @entity9 but she might be wearing it under her coat			1
if @entity9 is pregnant and she gives birth to a son the @entity18 dynasty is assured			2
if she has a girl analysts say the hierarchy will insist she ‘ tries again ’			0
the @entity65 have carefully studied photographs of @entity18 and his wife , published over four pages in the @entity3 ’s @entity120 newspaper			0
facial expressions and the people who accompany the couple are all of vital importance to intelligence - gatherers			0

she was , said state media , his wife – and that announcements was seen as a slight lifting of the veil of mystery hiding events in the country			0
