above , one of the earliest projectors which used the technology a film camera is expected to fetch £ 20,000 at auction at @entity8 , @entity9 later this year			0
the @entity1 changed cinema on its launch in 1908 , allowing the capture of moving footage in colour			1
the camera , one of the oldest surviving pieces of equipment , will go under the hammer later this year after being put up for sale by a private owner			1
previously @entity1 projectors have sold for around £ 4,000 at auctions held by @entity24 in @entity25			1
in 2012 , footage taken using the cameras emerged , with sharp moving images of @entity25 in the early 1900s shown in colour for the first time			1
the scenes , screened at the @entity32 , ranged from roughly 5 to 40 seconds and showed a parrot , a @entity25 street scene , and three smiling children sitting around a table covered with a burgundy cloth batting at a goldfish bowl with large sunflowers			1
the clips had long been considered failed prototypes and were consigned to an archive			0
the process came about after years of tireless work by inventor @entity45			0
when he died , a colour system he had devised to record moving pictures was passed on to @entity50 @entity49			0
@entity49 teamed up with film pioneer @entity51 to develop it further , with the pair reaching success eventually in the early @entity55			0
@entity45 had established that by combining the three primary colours ( red , blue and green ) , film makers would be able to depict any other hues			2
@entity49 and @entity51 withdrew blue from the wheel after deciding an adequate palette could be reached using just red and green			0
their happy discovery in 1906 was described in account given by @entity51 years later			2
' it took about thirty seconds to make the exposure on a specially prepared negative film after which we went into @entity51 's small darkroom to develop the results in absolute darkness			0
' within two hours we had dried the negative , made a positive print of the 50 feet length , developed and dried it - and then for the grand test			0
' even today - after seventeen years , i can still feel the thrill of that moment , when i saw the result of the two - colour process - i yelled like a drunken cowboy - " we 've got it - we 've got it " '			2
it was another two years before the pair were able to unveil the technology to audiences for the first time .			1

the @entity1 allowed film to be shown in colour for the first time
in 1906 inventors found only two colours were needed to create others
@entity1 was unveiled to audiences two years later in @entity25
now one of the oldest surviving pieces of equipment is to be sold
