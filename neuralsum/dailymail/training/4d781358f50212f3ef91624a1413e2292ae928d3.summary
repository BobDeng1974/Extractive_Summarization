a computer programme that composes music by monitoring a person 's emotional response to sounds , is to have one of its musical creations performed by a full chamber orchestra at a prestigious music festival tonight			1
using its artificial intelligence , the silicon songsmith has produced a remix of the second movement of @entity6 's 7th symphony , which will be performed by the @entity23 at the @entity24 in @entity25			1
researchers played the @entity29 composer 's seminal piece to three test subjects as they underwent mri scans while the programme monitored their brains for emotional indicators			1
then using a programmed knowledge of music , it generated a new piece designed to create a similar emotional response			2
the project , which has been compared to @entity43 's @entity42 chess computer , is being led by dr @entity44 , a professor at @entity47 's @entity46 for @entity48 ( @entity47 ) , and dr @entity49 , a professor in the @entity50 at the @entity51			2
dr @entity52 told the @entity53 : ' we all know music affects mood but we do n't really know how			0
' we want to see if we can find musical melodies or rhythms which elicit specific moods			0
which kind of musical features in composition elicit physical signatures in brain patterns ? our project is to build a new system for musical composition			0
' the three volunteers - a ballerina , a @entity71 veteran and dr @entity52 himself - were chosen in an attempt to obtain a broad cross-section of brain types			2
the computer programme monitors people 's emotional response to music as they are being subjected to an mri scan			1
the composition is to be performed by a chamber orchestra at a prestigious music festival tonight while the ballerina 's created mostly rhythmic deviations from the original piece , dr @entity52 's produced mostly harmonic deviations - possibly due to the fact he is also a composer			1
he added : ' with the classical ballerina there was a lot of activation around the motor cortex because she listens to music based on the kind of movement she can make			0
' i deconstructed the @entity100 and reassembled and modified the rhythms and melodies based on information from the brain scans			0
' dr @entity52 believes the programme has potential theraputic applications and could be used too treat depression without resorting to drugs			0
it could also be used in the entertainment industry and in advertising by inducing a desired emotion when presented alongside a particular product or service .			0
