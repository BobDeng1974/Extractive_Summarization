the research challenges the notion that @entity20 are a prudish nation , with 40 per cent of women - the equivalent of 8 million of them - looking at themselves naked in the mirror every day			1
when women reach 34 - like @entity14 and @entity13 this year - they are finally happy with their bodies both @entity14 and @entity13 feel comfortable enough in their own skin to post these revealing snaps on @entity30 a further 25 per cent sneak a peek at least once a week and just 16 per cent of @entity2 women never look at themselves in the mirror when they 're nude			2
beautician @entity36 says the findings make sense : ' those in their early to mid-thirties typically have great body confidence			0

this is closely followed by legs ( 22 per cent ) and shoulders ( 19 per cent )			0
when asked what part of their body they would most like to change , the majority ( 57 per cent ) said their stomachs			2
yet as we hit peak beach season , @entity2 women are in a quandary about what to wear while sun - bathing			0
social media is influencing women ’s decision - making processes ; 65 per cent wo n’t wear a bikini on holiday for fear of embarrassing photos appearing on @entity79			2
@entity80 , 49 , had the best bikini body while @entity83 's bottom came top in the poll when it comes to @entity20 ’ bikini idols , @entity80 , 49 , secured the most votes ( 50 per cent ) in the best body category			1
@entity83 topped the poll for best bottom ( 43 per cent ) , closely followed by @entity90 ( 32 per cent ) and @entity91 ( 8 per cent )			0

topping the poll for best arms was yoga devotee @entity103 ( 47 per cent ) followed by former ballerina and @entity106 judge @entity105 ( 25 per cent )			1
@entity95 and @entity97 have the curvy bodies that women most envy @entity105 ’s ballerina - sculpted legs are also envied by 16 per cent of @entity2 women , second only to @entity111 whose athletic legs are coveted by 35 per cent of @entity20			1
