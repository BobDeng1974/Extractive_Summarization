it was not that long ago that online banking was rolled out by all major banks , but now anyone living in @entity4 with a bank account and @entity6 handle can send a tweet to transfer money			1
the service , called @entity10 , was developed by one of @entity4 's largest banks and uses the social network to send cash between users , who reportedly do n’t even have to enter bank details			1
the move by @entity18 , @entity4 's second largest bank by customers , coincides with @entity6 's own push into the world of online payments as the social network seeks new sources of revenue beyond advertising			1
the service , called @entity10 , was developed by one of @entity4 's largest banks and uses @entity6 ( screenshot pictured ) to send cash between users , who do n’t even have to enter bank details @entity6 is racing other tech giants @entity32 and @entity33 to get a foothold in new payment services for mobile phones or apps and while s - money is not an official @entity6 product , it shows what is possible on social networks			1
‘ ( @entity44 ) offers @entity6 users in @entity4 a new way to send each other money , irrespective of their bank and without having to enter the beneficiary 's bank details , with a simple tweet , ’ @entity42 , chief executive of @entity10 , @entity18 's mobile payments unit , said in a statement			1
payment by tweets will be managed via the bank 's s - money service , which allows money transfers via text message and relies on the credit - card industry 's data security standards			1
@entity33 and @entity6 are said to be working on ways for people to transfer money , making splitting the bill ( illustrated ) as easy as sending a message it is not clear at this time how the technology works and mr @entity42 simply said : ‘ the ease of use and immediacy of the s - money payment solution for individuals is perfectly adapted to the @entity6 user experience			1
’ it appears that the service simply uses @entity6 in a way that can be compared to third - party initiative such as @entity80 ’ # @entity79 and @entity82 ’s # @entity81 , where people use a specific hashtag in exchange for goods			2
last month , @entity6 started trials of its own new service , @entity89 , to allow consumers to find and buy products on its social network the service embeds a ‘ @entity89 ’ button inside tweets posted by more than two dozen non-profits music artists such as @entity98 and vendors such as @entity100 and @entity101			1
@entity6 's role to date has been to connect customers rather than processing payments or checking their identities			2
‘ from the @entity6 point of view , there is a limit to their appetite for getting involved in payments processing itself , ’ said @entity106 , a payments analyst with financial services research firm @entity108 , who is based in @entity110 , @entity111			0
‘ at the moment , banks are probably viewing @entity6 and other social media networks as marketing channels to reach a wider set of their customers and to extend the bank 's existing mobile banking initiatives , ’ he said			2
last month , @entity6 started trials of its new service , @entity89 , to allow consumers to find and buy products on its social network			2
the service embeds a ‘ @entity89 ’ button inside tweets posted by more than two dozen non-profits music artists such as @entity98 and vendors such as @entity100 ( a catwalk show is pictured ) @entity6 is testing a ' buy button ' which can generate cash from its users			1
the button sits in a tweet and lets people simply click to buy what they see			0
it 's being tested in a ' small percentage of @entity145 users '			0
a total of 20 brands , including retailers including @entity100 , musicians such as @entity150 , and non-profits are involved in the trial			0
the move is the first bug attempt by @entity6 to generate revenue by a means other than advertising			1
once users have clicked ' @entity89 ' they will be asked to enter their payment and shipping details , unless it is not their first purchase in which case their details could have been stored			2
@entity6 's success in developing additional services on its platform as @entity33 has done will be key to its future profitability			1
@entity169 in @entity170 offers a similar ‘ transfer by @entity33 ’ service that lets users of its mobile banking app send money to anyone in their @entity33 friends list			1
investors have been worried about @entity6 's slowing user growth , sending the shares down about 17 per cent this year , while rival @entity33 's have climbed 35 per cent			1
@entity181 , a marketing strategy analyst with @entity182 , said @entity6 was likely to multiply efforts to explore new ways to generate revenue with banks and credit card firms			1
‘ @entity6 wants to more explicitly demonstrate the overall value of its network as an advertising platform , ’ he said			0
@entity192 - @entity191 , ceo of @entity18 said : ' @entity18 is the first banking group to offer individuals a payment solution where they can transfer money with a simple tweet			1
‘ this @entity10 initiative opens up a whole new range of payment possibilities on the social networks			0
' there is no indication that the service will be rolled out internationally			0
friends using @entity205 could soon send each other money in a very similar way to how they currently exchange photos within private messages			0
this rumour is based on screenshots taken by a @entity145 computer science student who uncovered what he believes is @entity33 ’s next move to make its stand - alone messaging service more popular			2
the payment options appear to let users send money in the same way they send files , with the addition of in - app pin code to boost security			0
@entity226 , a student at @entity227 in @entity228 , used an @entity230 tool called @entity231 on an @entity232 to explore the ‘ forthcoming ’ feature , which has yet to be confirmed by @entity33 , @entity225 reported			0
he said users will be able to pay friends at the touch of a button within a message , but at this stage it is not known whether the feature will be offered for free , or whether users will have to pay a charge for the convenience			0
a messenger payment service would go head - to - head with @entity246 , as well as other peer - to - peer payment systems			0
it would also make @entity33 ’s offering stand out from other popular messaging apps such as @entity250			0
‘ with @entity33 messenger , you attach money just like you attach a photo or a location			0
you do n't even have to link a bank account ! ’ mr @entity226 tweeted			2
he continued that users can press a button to make a payment , entering the amount of money they want to send			2
the transaction is not posted to a user ’s @entity262 and is kept private			0
explaining how it works , mr @entity226 said the system uses ‘ some magical means ’ to look up the bank account number of a recipient , before depositing the chosen sum of money			1
mr @entity226 believes that @entity33 will roll out the feature in the @entity145 over the next few months , but concedes that it could take much longer .			0

payment function was developed by @entity4 bank @entity18
from today , @entity4 *residents* can transfer money by sending a tweet
users of the service need a @entity6 handle and bank account
details on how it works are scarce , but no bank details need to be entered
move coincides with @entity6 's attempts to generate revenue by another means other than advertising , with its ' @entity89 ' button
@entity33 is rumoured to be working on a service that lets friends transfer money to each other without the hassle of *remembering* bank details
