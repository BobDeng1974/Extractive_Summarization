by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 18:48 est , 4 july 2012 what are you to do with when all the limos are booked up on your prom night ? for best friends @entity6 and @entity7 , the answer was to take a £ 500 helicopter ride instead			1
looking more like celebrities than schoolgirls , the 16 - year - olds upped the glamour stakes by flying to their end - of - year party just eight miles from where they live			2
in a scene more akin to the @entity19 high school prom - craze , the two girls touched down outside the venue and stepped out in their ballgowns wowing their shocked school friends			2
the pair had hoped to get a limo for their trip to the prom at the @entity27 , @entity28 and were disappointed to discover they were all fully booked			0
best friends @entity6 and @entity7 , pictured , certainly arrived in style at their prom party but they certainly were n’t disappointed for long			1
@entity7 ’s dad @entity33 stepped in to help , and arranged for the girls to be glamorously dropped off to the prom by helicopter instead - and also went along for the ride			1
the girls were picked up in the @entity40 twin - engine chopper at @entity42 playing field in @entity43 and treated to a half - hour ride before surprising their friends when the chopper made its landing at the venue			2
@entity6 said : ' it was a fantastic trip - really good fun			1
we got in the helicopter and flew around for half - an - hour before being dropped off at our prom			2
' all our friends were really shocked - they could not believe it			0
@entity6 , left , and @entity7 , right , take off for the flight of their life with pilot @entity59 it was a very glamorous entrance for the girls , more akin to the @entity19 - style prom craze dressed in their ballgowns , the girls shocked their friends when they made their arrival at the venue in a helicopter ' we landed on a patch of grass right next to the tent where our prom was taking place in			1
' we had wanted to get a limousine to the venue but they had all gone by the time we went to book it - but this was even better			0
' the prom was brilliant too			0
' for @entity6 the prom marked the end of her time at @entity81 in @entity43			1
she now plans to study beauty therapy at @entity83 , while @entity7 , from @entity42 will stay on to study in @entity85 ’s sixth - form department			1
the girls may have been inspired from the blinging ways of across the pond , where extravagant high school proms are treated as a rite of passage			0
the girls , who were also joined by @entity7 's dad , @entity33 , enjoyed a 30 minute ride before being dropped off thanks to shows such as @entity95 and films like @entity97 , the @entity19 - style proms have been increasingly on the rise in @entity100			1
parents are being persuaded to spend hundreds , if not thousands , of pounds on dresses , hair , spray tans , tiaras and limos as @entity19 - style proms take hold in @entity100			0
last week @entity110 , aged 16 , from @entity111 , @entity112 , confessed that her parents @entity114 , 51 , and @entity115 , 52 , spent a staggering £ 799 on styling their daughter head - to - toe and waving her off in a limo			2
she said : ‘ of course on the day , people will be judging everyone else ’s look			0
with that many girls , and that many spray tans and big hair , there will be bitchiness			0
‘ even now , everyone is keeping their dress secret as they ’re so paranoid that someone will copy them — and they want to keep it as a surprise for their big entrance			0
