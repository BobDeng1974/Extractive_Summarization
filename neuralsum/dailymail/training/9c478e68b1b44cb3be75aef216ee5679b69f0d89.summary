bed bug outbreaks have soared over the past six years , with overseas travellers blamed for the increase in infestations			2
@entity4 and the @entity5 have been the hardest hit , with pest controllers reporting a 108 per cent increase in call - outs			0

bed bug outbreaks have soared over the past six years , with overseas travellers blamed for the increase in infestations pest control company @entity22 says the rise could in part be blamed on the 2008 financial crisis , which left hotels with smaller budgets to tackle pests			2
the problem has become so bad that @entity22 has launched a new service called ‘ @entity30 ’ - an early detection programme for bed bug activity			1
the monitoring service uses a food - based lure which actively attracts bed bugs onto a sticky pad , providing an early warning of infestation			1
the lures are placed discreetly around the bedroom , such as under the bed or in suitcase storage areas where the creatures may have hitched a ride in baggge			0
the firm says the initiative will enable housekeeping staff to be the “ first line of defence ” in detecting an infestation			0
bed bugs can lay 200 to 500 eggs over a two - month period , and are often difficult to spot - after hatching they take six to eight weeks to mature and they survive by feeding on blood spokesman @entity57 said : ‘ contrary to popular belief , bed bugs are not a sign of poor hygiene – unfortunately , they ’re a pest that can be inadvertently introduced anywhere which has a regular turnover of people and luggage			1
‘ the answer to preventing widespread infestations is early detection and dealing with an outbreak as soon as possible			0
‘ bed bugs can pose serious risks to an organisation ’s reputation and profitability and the longer you leave it , the more expensive it becomes to bring under control and eradicate			2
