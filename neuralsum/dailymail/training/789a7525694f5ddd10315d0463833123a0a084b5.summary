by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 09:47 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 20:21 est , 24 january 2013 @entity1 has signalled that he may send his eldest son to a private school , potentially sparking controversy about his commitment to state education			1
the deputy prime minister said he would put his children ’s education first and would not overrule the wishes of his wife or son for ‘ political reasons ’			1
mr @entity1 and his @entity15 wife , @entity14 , have looked around several schools , including the exclusive catholic state school @entity17 and a £ 30,000 - a - year independent school			1
deputy prime minister @entity1 said he would not overrule wife @entity14 or son @entity21 if they chose a private school the @entity26 leader ’s admission comes just days after @entity27 insisted he was ‘ committed ’ to sending his eldest daughter @entity28 to a state school as in @entity30 ‘ there ’s a real improvement taking place ’			1
but mr @entity1 refused to make the same pledge when quizzed about his 11 - year - old son @entity35 , who is due to start secondary school in september			1
the @entity37 have two other sons @entity39 , seven , and @entity40 , three			0
speaking during his regular phone - in show on @entity42 , mr @entity1 said of their eldest son : ‘ if we can and it works out to send him to a good state school we would do so			1
‘ but like all parents living in @entity30 , there ’s huge competition for places and we do n’t yet know where and exactly at what school			2
‘ i never have sought to impose a decision on my wife as well as my son for political reasons			2
‘ they are educated at the moment in the state sector , both our oldest , and i will let you know as soon as a decision has been arrived at			2
’ sources close to mr @entity1 said he recognises that the couple ’s decision is ‘ a matter of public interest ’ and they expect to make an announcement in the next couple of months			2
mr @entity1 is widely believed to defer in matters of child - rearing to his formidable wife , who ensured that they were raised as @entity73 , despite mr @entity1 ’s atheist convictions			0
he has previously condemned the gulf in educational standards between private and state schools as ‘ corrosive for our society and damaging to our economy ’			2
mr @entity1 used his weekly radio phone - in to insist he would not turn his children 's education into a political football mr @entity1 was educated at two independent schools , @entity84 in @entity85 in @entity86 - a £ 5,060 - a - term prep - school where he was joint @entity88 in 1980 - and later at @entity89 in @entity30 , which costs over £ 21,000 - a - year for day pupils			1
his son @entity39 is at primary school and @entity40 is due to start school next year			1
@entity40 and @entity21 attend a @entity95 primary school			0
the comments follow @entity27 ’s remarks last week that he remained ‘ committed ’ to sending his eldest daughter @entity28 to a state secondary school			1
mr @entity27 said : ‘ in @entity30 there ’s a real improvement taking place			0
there ’s a revolution taking place in all schools actually			0
‘ there ’s a big culture change in our schools and that ’s taking place in @entity30			0
so i remain committed to what i ’ve said in the past			0
’ but mr @entity1 has yet to make a decision , insisting ‘ i am a father before i ’m a politician ’			0
‘ i want my child to have the best possible education , i would ever , ever begrudge any parent whether they send their children to a private or a state school , to do the best for their children , it ’s the most fundamental instinct anyone has			1
‘ and by the way i have that raging through my veins as much as any father who wants the best for my child			0
‘ i ’ve said it before it ’s not about whether it ’s private or public , in that sense you ’re quite right it can be either , i just want the best for my child and that ’s exactly what i think most people listening to this programme want for their children as well			0
