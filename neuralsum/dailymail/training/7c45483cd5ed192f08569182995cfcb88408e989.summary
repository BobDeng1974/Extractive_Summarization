the two fisherman who 'd set out on a trip to check the status of their crab pots were minding their own business when a disgruntled visitor slipped beneath the surface of @entity22 , near @entity23 , before making a beeline for their boat			1
capturing the moment the croc slipped under the muddy surface was @entity0 - a fisherman who uploaded the footage to @entity31			1
he commented during the 35 second clip that the inquisitive creature was ' coming out to see us ' before he flicked the engine switch on his boat and idled away in the opposite direction			1
' ah , s * * * he 's coming straight for us , ' mr @entity39 's co fisherman said when he spotted the croc			2
' he 's after us			2
' mr @entity0 wrote the trip was all ' fun and games ' until their unexpected crocodile encounter in a part of the country teeming with the salt water reptiles			1
' the little bugger was sitting right next to the float , ' he said			2
when mr @entity0 quickly noticed the speed and direction with which the crocodile was taking he quickly began motoring off in the opposite direction			1
' f * * * that , i 'm getting out of here , ' he said , before signing off ' see ya later buddy			2
