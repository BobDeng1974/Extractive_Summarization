by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 20:11 est , 17 november 2013 a new ‘ secret justice ’ row flared up last night after it was revealed that two suspected terrorists could be tried behind closed doors			1
prosecutors will apply to a judge today for a draconian order to hold large parts of a major terrorist trial out of the public eye			1
senior @entity12 detectives believe that alleged conspirators of the men could be tipped off if details of their actions are made public			1
they said there are ‘ strong operational reasons ’ for large swathes of the trial to be held in secret			1
veil : senior @entity12 detectives believe that alleged conspirators of the terror suspects could be tipped off if details of their actions are made public but critics said the move is further evidence of a dangerous trend of secrecy despite @entity31 ’s historic commitment to open justice			1
@entity33 , director of campaign group @entity34 , condemned the move as part of a ‘ dramatic drift towards secret trials ’			1
‘ cases littered with initials instead of names are no way of ensuring trust and confidence in our justice system , ’ she said			2
fears : liberty director @entity33 condemned the move as part of a ' dramatic drift towards secret trials ' ‘ the courts should at least provide clear explanations rather than bland assertions before closing their doors on press and public			1
’ neither of the men , both aged 25 , has been named publicly since they were arrested when the tyres of their car were blown out by police in @entity63 last month			1
both terrorist suspects are @entity31 citizens , one of @entity66 origin and the second from an @entity69 background			1
one of the men , known only as @entity71 , is charged with preparing terrorist acts , which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment , and possessing a terrorist document			1
the second man , known as @entity77 , has been charged with possessing a terrorist document and an offence under the @entity80			2
the document is suspected of being instructions on how to make a bomb and prosecutors claim it was found hidden on a memory card in their mobile phones			0
during a hearing last month , prosecutor @entity88 said the defendants could not be identified to ‘ protect an ongoing investigation ’			0
he said that associates of one of the defendants may also recognise him if further details of the charges he faces are revealed			0
two other men , aged 29 and 28 , arrested at the same time were later released without charge			2
the highly - sensitive inquiry comes amid growing concern about the threat of terrorist plots in @entity31 linked to jihadi groups fighting in the @entity107 civil war			1
the @entity108 has recently provided for secret sessions in @entity111 actions involving national security			2
anonymity orders are also common in the @entity114 which hears terror - related cases			0
but similar levels of secrecy are extremely rare in the criminal courts , where almost all proceedings are held in public			2
the preliminary hearing at the @entity122 will be before mr @entity123			0
the application for the secrecy order will be made by the @entity126			0
a @entity128 spokesman said : ‘ we apply for these orders in counter-terrorism cases rarely and only when we feel it is necessary to do so			0
@entity133 said open justice is ' an important function of an open society ' sir @entity137 , head of @entity139 , ( left ) and sir @entity140 , director of @entity141 , a public grilling of the heads of @entity31 ’s three spy agencies was branded a ‘ total pantomime ’ yesterday after it was revealed they knew the questions beforehand			1
mps and peers quizzed the men earlier this month amid claims their activities have invaded the privacy of millions			2
but sources close to the @entity155 ( @entity155 ) said they agreed to warn @entity157 ’s @entity156 , sir @entity137 of @entity139 and sir @entity140 of @entity141 what questions they would face			0
the agreement was the only way they would agree to be cross-examined			0
but one @entity163 mp told a sunday newspaper : ‘ evidently the whole thing was a total pantomime			0
’ the @entity167 confirmed the three were briefed with ‘ broad areas of questioning ’			0
@entity155 chairman sir @entity171 said they were given the first question for each category discussed , ‘ and supplementaries flowed from members of the committee ’			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

detectives say alleged conspirators could be tipped off if trial was public
but civil rights group condemn ' dramatic drift towards secret trials '
the two men are @entity31 citizens of @entity66 and @entity69 extraction
