they say imitation is the most sincere form of flattery , but for @entity4 , 42 , it could have been deadly			1
the former model from @entity6 , @entity7 , was almost left paralysed after a jealous neighbour laid a tripwire outside her door , sending her hurtling down two flights of stairs			1
the trap was the climax to a bizarre sequence of events , which included @entity4 's next door neighbour @entity17 changing her appearance and dress style to seemingly look like her			1
@entity4 , 42 , from @entity7 , suffered a string of bizarre incidents with jealous neighbour @entity17 , that culminated in @entity17 leaving a tripwire at the top of the stairs			1
the trap sent @entity4 hurtling down two flights and left her with serious bruising and a brokwn then in january 2014 , @entity4 tripped over the wire as she walked out of her apartment , suffering severe injuries to her face , wrist , neck and back			1
her neighbour @entity17 was convicted last month of setting the tripwire and will be sentenced on february 5			1
@entity4 also describes how @entity38 would sit at an upstairs window - overlooking the driveway - and watch @entity4 as she went about her daily affairs			1
@entity4 , a 42 year old law graduate and former model , said : ' at first i was quite flattered that she wanted to look like me , but then it became creepy			1
i started to worry that she was jealous of me - or even infatuated in some way			2
' but i could never have foreseen what she did next			2
@entity4 now runs a property business but used to work as a model ' what upsets me most is that she was inside her flat as i went bumping down the stairs ; she must have heard me screaming for help , and yet she ignored me			1
' i could have died that day			2
' @entity4 , who runs a property business , bought her luxury penthouse next door to @entity38 's one - bedroom flat in upmarket @entity6 , @entity7 , 15 years ago			1
she began living there herself two years ago , along with her 25 - year - old son , @entity59			2
@entity4 said : ' when i had first met @entity17 she seemed nice , there was no problem			1
but after i moved in there , she had just split with her long - term partner and was really quite upset			2
' she then had a knee operation , and she piled on weight , going from a size 12 to a size 20			0
' maybe she felt like life was going against her , because she seemed quite bitter			0
@entity17 , who has been convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm against @entity4 ' whenever i came home from holiday she would say : " it 's all right for some			1
" ' i got the impression she was jealous			0
' but i have worked very hard for what i have			0
@entity17 has never had a job as long as i 've known her			1
she had no reason to resent me at all			0
' a few months on , @entity4 noticed that @entity17 was beginning to change her hair and dress style			1
she said : ' @entity17 had brown hair but she had it coloured blonde , like mine			1
then , she got hair extensions , so that it was the same length as mine			2
' i always wear leggings and the same make of boots - and @entity17 started to do the same , which was completely different to her usual style			1
' at first , i suppose i felt a bit flattered , though i could n't see why she would want to copy me			0
but then , it began to freak me out			0
' one day i bumped into her and she was wearing the exact same shade of orange lipstick which i wear every day			0
' i began to wonder whether she was obsessed with me in some way			0
it was like the film @entity96			0
' to add to @entity4 's concerns , @entity17 would spend most of her time sitting at a window which overlooked their shared driveway			1
@entity102 : ' at first , i 'd spot her and wave			0
i did n't think anything of it			0
but then , i noticed that whatever time i came home , @entity17 was there			1
' sometimes , i 'd come home from work at 1am or 2am - and she was watching me			2
' as i was unlocking my front door , she would come out			0
if i had been somewhere nice , perhaps on holiday , she 'd make a nasty comment as if she was jealous			2
' @entity4 also noticed that large amounts of her mail were going missing , including bank statements and business letters , from the shared letterbox in the apartment complex			1
she sa : ' at first i blamed my son , thinking he was losing it			0
i went to the sorting office and complained to them			0
i even called the police			0
' i had no proof where the mail had gone			0
' the police said the easiest thing would be to get my own locked letter box , and after that , the problem was solved			0
' in october 2013 , @entity4 paid a tradesman Â£ 800 to build a large storage cupboard outside her apartment			1
but when she came to use it , shortly afterwards , she found it full of @entity17 's belongings			1
@entity4 says : ' i could n't believe it			1
the cupboard was full of unopened disability aids , which @entity17 had been given by social services , but did n't use			1
' the wire at the top of the stairs that caused @entity4 to fall			1
she took the picture with her mobile phone after dragging herself back up the point at the top of the stairs where the wire was placed she continued : ' i asked her politely to take them out but she refused			1
i told her that if she did n't move them , i would			0
we did n't have a huge argument but we certainly exchanged words			0
' @entity4 says : ' looking back , the tension was building			1
she watched me and my son enjoy a family @entity156 and then we went on holiday			0
' for some twisted reason , i think she resented me			0
' days later , in january 2014 , @entity17 set the tripwire which was to bring the whole saga to a horrific end			1
@entity4 says : ' i often get up early for work and on this particular day , i was ready to leave at 5am , with my overnight bag in one hand and a bin - bag in the other			1
@entity4 is still reeling from the tripwire attack as she left her flat early one morning ' the stairway in the hall was unusually dark as we were waiting for an electrician to fix the lights			1
' as @entity4 reached the top stair , she felt something sharp on her shin and she hurtled headlong down two flights of stairs			1
she says : ' instinctively , i put my hands out and my face smashed against the wall as my wrist was bent backwards			2
' i landed upside down , and the pain was horrendous			0
i was convinced i had broken my neck			0
' my brother broke his neck as a teenager , and all i could think of was that the same had happened to me , and of how my poor mum would cope			2
' i could taste blood			0
it was running down my face and in my hair			2
' i was screaming for help and sobbing loudly , but nobody came			0
i was so disorientated , i could n't even remember whether my son had come home the night before or if he was at his girlfriend 's			0
' realising that help might be hours away , @entity4 dragged herself back up the stairs , in excruciating pain , and found her mobile phone - smashed but still working - along the way			1
it was then , with the light of the phone , that she saw the tripwire			0
she says : ' i was anxious to see what had caused my fall			0
i thought maybe a banister had fallen out or a carpet rod had come loose			0
' but then i saw the wire , wrapped several times around the banister to make it absolutely tight - and the other end disappeared inside @entity17 's flat			1
in horror , @entity4 went back inside her own apartment , where her screams awoke her son			2
@entity4 likened her situation with her next door neighbour to the film @entity96 , starring @entity221 and @entity222 ( pictured )			1
in the movie , a woman tries to find fulfillment by trying become her successful roommate she says : ' when my son realised what had happened he rushed down and took photos of the tripwire			0
' but in - between then - and the sound of the sirens approaching - the tripwire was removed			2
' @entity4 was taken to hospital with injuries to her face , neck , back and wrist			1
@entity38 was arrested but denied the offence			0
she was bailed and allowed to return to her flat , next door to @entity4			2
@entity4 says : ' there was no remorse at all			2
if anything , as she saw me struggling with my injuries , she looked rather smug			0
' @entity17 appeared before @entity244 in december 2014 and was convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm			1
@entity4 says : ' i am still suffering the effects of what she did			2
i have terrible headaches and have damage to the upper part of my spine			0
' my right wrist is also badly injured , which means i 've had to give up painting ; a hobby i used to love			2
' after the incicent , @entity4 was taken to hospital with injuries to her face , neck , back and wrist she continued : ' i ask myself constantly why she would do such a wicked thing			1
we 'd had a couple of minor disagreements , but there was nothing to suggest this			0
' she must have heard me as i fell down the stairs - i bumped along her lounge wall			1
' she must have heard me screaming and pleading for help , yet she did nothing			0
' i could drive myself mad with trying to understand what happened but i 'm a survivor and a fighter , and i will bounce back from this			0
' @entity17 has slowed me down , but she wo n't beat me			2
i only hope the courts give her the punishment she truly deserves			0
