by @entity0 published : 05:31 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 07:13 est , 7 march 2013 underground oceans could be bubbling up to the surface of @entity5 's @entity4 , scientists believe - making it the perfect place to look for life			1
a new paper has detailed the strongest evidence yet that salty water from the huge liquid ocean beneath @entity4 ’s frozen surface actually makes its way to the moon ’s surface – reinforcing suggestions that there could be life on @entity4			1
the research suggests there is a chemical exchange between the ocean and surface , making the ocean a richer chemical environment			1
illustration shows @entity28 in the foreground with @entity5 to the right and lo - another of @entity5 's moons - in the middle the report was compiled by professor @entity34 , an astronomer at the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , and @entity39 from @entity41 's @entity40 , also in @entity42			1
the exchange between the ocean and the surface , professor @entity34 said , ‘ means that energy might be going into the ocean , which is important in terms of the possibilities for life there			1
‘ it also means that if you 'd like to know what 's in the ocean , you can just go to the surface and scrape some off			1
’ @entity28 's ocean is thought to cover the moon 's whole globe and is about 60 miles deep under a thin ice shell			1
scientists have long debated the composition of @entity28 ’s surface			2
now , using the @entity64 on @entity65 , @entity66 , professor @entity34 and mr @entity39 have identified indications of the presence of a magnesium sulphate salt , a mineral called epsomite , that could have formed by oxidation of a mineral likely originating from the ocean below			0
the researchers started their study by mapping the distribution of pure water ice versus anything else			0
then , at low latitudes - the area with the greatest concentration of the non-water ice material - they found a tiny , never - before - detected , change in the results			0
the two researchers tested everything from sodium chloride to @entity88 in mr @entity39 's laboratory where he tries to simulate the environments found on various icy worlds			0
at the end of the day , the signature of magnesium sulphate persisted			0
salty water from the huge liquid ocean beneath @entity4 's frozen surface makes its way to the moon 's surface , scientists believe the authors , who are publishing their report in the @entity104 , believe that this magnesium sulphate is generated from magnesium chloride salt which originates in @entity28 ’s ocean			1
the scientists also believe the composition of @entity28 's ocean may closely resemble the salty ocean of @entity111			2
@entity28 is considered a premier target in the search for life beyond @entity111 , mr @entity39 said			0
a @entity41 - funded study team is working with the scientific community to identify options to explore @entity28 further			0
‘ if we 've learned anything about life on @entity111 , it 's that where there 's liquid water , there 's generally life , ’ mr @entity39 said			1
‘ and of course our ocean is a nice , salty ocean			0
perhaps @entity28 's salty ocean is also a wonderful place for life			2
’ @entity28 is the sixth closest moon to @entity5 and the smallest of the four @entity133 satellites that belong to the planet			2
it was discovered by @entity135 in january 1610 and is named after a @entity137 noblewoman in @entity139 mythology who was courted by @entity140 and became the queen of @entity142			0
@entity28 orbits @entity5 in around three - and - a - half days with an orbital radius of 670,900km			2
it is slightly smaller than the @entity111 's moon , but at 3,100km in diameter it is the sixth largest moon and 15th largest object in the entire solar system			1
it is likely to have an outer layer of water , some 100km thick			0
the outer layer of the water is believed to be frozen with a liquid ocean underneath			2
it is one of the smoothest objects in the solar system with few craters on its surface , which is tectonically active and relatively young .			0

water from the ocean *inside* @entity4 makes its way to the surface
this suggests that there could be life on @entity5 's moon
