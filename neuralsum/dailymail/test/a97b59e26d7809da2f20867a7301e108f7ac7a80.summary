the future of @entity2 's independent nuclear deterrent sparked a bitter war of words yesterday			1
tories claimed @entity7 leader @entity6 would be happy with @entity8 as prime minister because he can not be trusted to keep our @entity11 submarines			1
defence secretary @entity13 led a ferocious assault on the @entity16 leader – claiming he is a ' backstabber ' who can not be trusted not to sell out in a ' grubby ' deal with the @entity20			1
business and skills minister @entity25 , a close ally of @entity26 , went further , claiming the @entity7 president would be pleased to see mr @entity8 enter @entity28 propped up by @entity20 leader @entity29			1
who does @entity6 want to see running @entity2 after may 7 ? ' mr @entity25 demanded			1
' answer : the man who abandoned the @entity33 to their fate and the woman who wants to scrap our nuclear deterrent			0
he … stood alongside @entity6 in protecting [ @entity33 president ] @entity39			0
' mr @entity8 reacted with fury to the attacks , accusing the @entity5 of ' desperate smears ' and dragging the election campaign ' into the gutter ' by claiming he would ' stab the @entity2 in the back ' in the same way that he did brother @entity48 in the @entity16 leadership contest			1
' @entity26 should be ashamed , ' mr @entity8 said , insisting that @entity16 was committed to renewing the @entity11 fleet			1
but mr @entity13 's promise to renew all four submarines appeared to leave @entity16 in disarray			1
mr @entity13 said the full replacement of @entity11 would be a ' red line ' in any second conservative - liberal @entity57 coalition			1
' i want to see multilateral disarmament , i 'm not in favour of unilateral disarmament			0
that means we have got to have the least cost deterrent that we can have			0
' - @entity8 , january 5 ' we 're going to see whether there 's any way you could do it with three [ submarines ]			2
' - @entity70 , march 15 ' [ four submarines ] is exactly the policy that we have had for a very long time			0
' - @entity73 , wednesday ' four boats ... but we 'll look at that in government			0
' - @entity77 , yesterday ' it 's right to have a review because technology changes			0
' - @entity8 , yesterday for @entity16 , however , frontbenchers gave differing positions			2
some suggested a @entity16 government might cut the number of submarines			2
mr @entity8 said he favoured ' basically four boats ' but it was ' right to have a review ' while @entity16 treasury spokesman @entity73 said that maintaining four submarines was ' exactly the policy that we have had for a very long time '			1
earlier this year mr @entity8 had said he favoured the ' least cost deterrent ' possible			1
and in march , shadow chancellor @entity70 had said the party would see whether three submarines could suffice			0
military experts insist four submarines are the minimum needed to ensure @entity11 can be deployed at sea at all times			2
any fewer would mean that the missiles would on occasion be left vulnerable in port			0
mr @entity13 attacked the idea of having only three , saying there was no point in having a deterrent that ' takes the weekend off '			2
a survey of @entity16 candidates , conducted by the @entity109 , suggests that mr @entity8 would have difficulty carrying large sections of his party with him if he sought to renew @entity11			1
in several @entity16 safe seats , mps who supported @entity11 are being replaced by candidates who oppose it			2
they include @entity117 in @entity118 , whose replacement @entity119 says : ' investment in nuclear is immoral in and of itself '			0
former defence secretary @entity123 said the lack of clarity from @entity16 over @entity11 left @entity2 in a ' very dangerous position '			1
' unless we are absolutely sure where they would be then we have to assume that they are not fit to protect this country by having a continuous nuclear deterrent , ' he said ' in a very dangerous world that is a very dangerous position			0
' as many as three - quarters of @entity16 candidates oppose the replacement of @entity2 's @entity11 nuclear deterrent			1
pictured is the @entity139 off the coast of @entity141 @entity109 's survey of @entity16 candidates suggested as many as three - quarters opposed the replacement of @entity2 's @entity11 nuclear deterrent			1
the anti-nuclear group said last month it had polled a ' representative sample ' of @entity16 candidates , including sitting mps			0
but @entity16 critics claimed only 73 candidates had been surveyed with 50 or so anti-trident			0
the finding suggested anti-nuclear @entity146 could make common cause with the @entity20 , which has said it wants to ditch @entity11			2
@entity16 's official policy is to maintain a continuous , submarine - based deterrent			0
but many senior figures want @entity16 to back a more limited , cut - price deterrent – while others believe the party should scrap it altogether			0
@entity157 , @entity109 's general - secretary , said : ' @entity16 candidates are in step with public opinion			2
the majority of the public do n't want tosee £ 100 billion spent on nuclear weapons			0
' mr @entity26 backed mr @entity13 's attack and challenged mr @entity8 to rule out any arrangement with the @entity20 that would put @entity16 into power			1
he said : ' when i listen to what @entity16 are saying , they are playing fast and loose with the country 's security			0
' miss @entity29 said : ' we would never be in any deal with a @entity16 government who is going to renew @entity11			2

tories say @entity7 's @entity6 would be happy with @entity8 as @entity177
this is because he can not be trusted to keep @entity2 's @entity11 submarines
defence secretary @entity13 said @entity16 could sell out in a @entity20 deal
mr @entity8 reacted with fury , stating @entity26 should be ' ashamed '
