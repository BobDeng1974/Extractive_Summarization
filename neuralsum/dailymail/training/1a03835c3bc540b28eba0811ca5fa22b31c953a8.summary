@entity0 will defy the sceptics over his working relationship with @entity3 by striking a more substantial coaching deal than expected with the former women ’s @entity6 champion			1
the 27 year - old @entity8 , who returns to action this week at the @entity10 in @entity11 , appears to have persuaded @entity3 to travel 25 weeks per year with him , which in top level tennis terms amounts to a full - blown commitment			1
some doubted how much time she would be prepared to give to @entity0 , or whether she wanted to do the travelling necessary , but she is set to put in plenty more weeks than @entity18 was doing towards the end of his tenure as coach			1
staying together : @entity0 will defy the sceptics over his working relationship with @entity3 by striking a more substantial coaching deal @entity3 has spent weeks at @entity0 ’s recent post-wimbledon training camp in @entity27 – another thing that some doubted she would attend – and has accompanied him to @entity30 as preparations for the @entity32 start in earnest			1
a notable absentee from @entity11 , i understand , will be @entity36 , his assistant coach and long - time cornerstone of his support staff			2
he is known to have been disturbed that he was not initially kept in the loop about @entity3 ’s appointment , only finding out when its likelihood was revealed by @entity43			2
he is said to have smoothed that over with his long - time friend , who explained that the whole @entity46 - @entity6 period was the most difficult in which to settle coaching arrangements			0
@entity36 gets on well with the ex @entity50 player , but the new structure around @entity0 will not see him travelling everywhere with the @entity8 as happened before			1
the @entity52 will still work with @entity0 , but has this week off and then will join up with him for the masters level event in @entity54 that immediately follows @entity11			1
sorted : the 27 - year - old @entity8 appears to have persuaded @entity3 to travel 25 weeks per year with him the delay of an official announcement about @entity3 seems to have been caused by it being holiday time and relevant lawyers drawing up the paperwork being on vacation			1
@entity0 swiftly returned to training following his surprise @entity6 quarter final exit			2
he is said to have been pleased with the training block in @entity65 and how it has gone with @entity3 , who has firm ideas but a more consensual approach than @entity18 , who was very much a ‘ my way or the highway ’ type of operator			2
this week represents the start of a new phase of the @entity8 ’s career in many senses , as he no longer carries around the @entity6 champion tag , is fully over his back surgery , and down to number ten in the rankings			1
when the draw for @entity11 came out on friday night he was slightly shielded from his new reality by being bumped up into the top eight seedings and therefore getting a bye , only due to the long - term absence of @entity85 and the shock withdrawal of @entity87 with a wrist injury			0
@entity0 ’s first opponent will be either @entity91 @entity90 or @entity87 ’s conqueror at @entity6 , @entity94 @entity93			1
should he survive that he may face @entity95 in the quarter finals			0
frustration : @entity0 was knocked out of @entity6 at the quarter - final stage against @entity98 the @entity100 number one has made clear that he will be taking to the two masters level events ahead of @entity102 with due seriousness as he tries to regain momentum for @entity105			0
he is said to be very motivated and , given that he only has a relatively paltry 630 ranking points to defend for the rest of the year , it can be expected that by the end of 2014 he will be back among the top seeds			0
@entity87 , on the other hand , may take quite a ranking hit if the injury to his right wrist tendon does not clear			0
he excelled this time last year , winning @entity30 , @entity54 and the @entity32 , and so has nearly a third of his computer points to defend in the next five weeks			0
while the damage to his tendon is not said to be severe any wrist problem can not be easily dismissed in tennis and it is difficult to see him lining up in @entity105 having not played since the @entity93 upset			0
@entity95 got married after @entity6 and his wife @entity124 is soon expecting their first child , so his life is about to become more complicated			0
other issues to look out for as tennis revives from its post-wimbledon slumbers are whether @entity130 – turning 33 this week - can keep his @entity132 momentum going and if @entity98 and @entity133 can follow up on their semi-final appearances there .			0
