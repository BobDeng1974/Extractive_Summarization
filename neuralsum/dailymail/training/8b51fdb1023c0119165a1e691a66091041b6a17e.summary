by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 luckless @entity3 's bid for a fifth pole position in @entity5 literally went up in flames as his car caught fire early in qualifying			1
just minutes into the session at the @entity12 , @entity3 's @entity10 was ablaze at the rear , and although he attempted to crawl back to the garage , it proved a futile exercise			1
@entity3 was forced to stop on the pit lane entry road where marshals quickly used extinguishers to douse the fire , started by what @entity10 claimed to be a fuel leak			1
now click here to read the report host commentator that 's @entity27 's third straight pole , and barring a mechanical problem , he looks set to extend his lead over @entity3 as we head into the summer break			1
thank you for your company today , and be sure to join us for tomorrow 's @entity34			1
@entity35 ; 2 @entity36 ; 3 @entity37 ; 4 @entity38 ; 5 @entity39 ; 6 @entity40 ; 7 @entity41 ; 8 @entity42 ; 9 @entity43 ; 10 @entity44 the @entity45 goes faster on his final run and he is almost half - a - second quicker than @entity36 who will be on the front row for tomorrow 's race			1
@entity41 goes fourth fastest , and he has time to turn in another lap. it 's @entity37 up next and the @entity52 man misses out on pole by just over one tenth			1
but @entity27 goes fastest with a 1:23.236 and he is almost two tenths quicker than @entity36			1
has he done enough to secure pole ? surely , the circuit will be improving but is the rain coming in again ? but what a time that is from @entity36 who lays down a marker with a time of 1:23.415 and he is the best part of eight tenths faster than @entity37			1
@entity37 is the man of the moment and he sets the fastest time			1
his first run is two seconds quicker than @entity27			2
does the @entity45 have one eye on the championship ? @entity38 is second fastest , three tenths adrift of the @entity52 with @entity39 up next			2
we 're back underway in @entity5 and it appears as though the track is at its worst in @entity72			1
the track could get quite a bit quicker in the next few minutes			0
@entity27 is the first man on track and he is followed by @entity38			2
the session will re-start in two minutes			0
the brolleys are still up , but it appears as though the rain has eased off			0
@entity27 locks his brakes at @entity72 and runs wide , and @entity81 , @entity44 is in the barriers after locking his brakes , too and he heads straight into the barriers			1
a heavy shunt for the @entity87 man , but he is ok and out of his car			0
the session is suspended as the marshalls repair the tyre barrier			0
the drivers are on slick tyres , but they probably know they have one shot at posting their best time with the rain intensifying			0
it 's raining in the paddock ahead of the top - 10 shootout			2
that will add a bit of spice to the remainder of the session			0
the cars are stacked at the end of the pit lane awaiting the green light			0
@entity27 laid down the marker with a 123.3 with the two @entity110 close behind him			2
it looks as though it is the @entity45 's pole to throw away today , mind			2
' so , we could n't even beat @entity115 , ' is the message from a frustrated @entity117 over the team radio			2
he will start 15th tomorrow			2
@entity120 had set two personal bests but lost the rear of his @entity123 under braking at @entity124 , and he is out of his car			0
on track , and with three minutes remaining , @entity43 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity117 and @entity128 are heading out of qualifying			2
it 's @entity27 , in the troubled - free @entity10 , who tops the timesheets			1
@entity3 : ' i bailed out of that timed lap and something happened to my brakes so i had to engage some settings to correct it and then the engine just died			2
i was on the pit lane entry so hoped i could get it back to the pits and they could fix it but i looked in my rear mirrors and it was on fire			2
' i hoped to get it to the garage and maybe they could do something but i tried to stop and the brakes were n’t working			0
it is all pretty bad			0
i honestly do n’t know what i can do tomorrow			0
i will struggle to get in the top 10 at least the top 5 i will probably leave here more than 20 points behind @entity27 but here are still races to go			1
i will try my best			0
' @entity160 : ' it is not back yet so we have to get it back and see what it is			0
the fuel pressure went down and there was a fire so the logic is the fuel caused the fire			0
i hope the car is n't too much damaged			0
two races in a row			0
he would have been fastest today			0
he would have won the race no question			2
' we 're green for @entity181 - a 15 - minute session to reduce the 16 remaining drivers to 10			0
will we get any more drama ? meanwhile , @entity10 have confirmed that a fuel leak caused the fire on @entity3 's car			1
for the second consecutive race @entity189 has been knocked out of qualifying in @entity192			1
the @entity193 was sitting in @entity195 garage as @entity196 , on the books of the @entity199 team of course , usurped his time			0
stunning pictures of @entity204 's @entity10 on fire			1
that will now be six races without pole for the @entity209 and it 's damage limitation once more for the 29 - year - old ... back on track , and @entity3 's nemesis @entity27 is top of the timesheets some two tenths ahead of @entity38			1
@entity196 , @entity216 , @entity117 and @entity217 occupy the relegation places with @entity219 and of course @entity3 both out of qualifying			1
@entity3 ca n't believe it			1
he watches the marshals put out the fire and puts his head in his hands			0
his @entity10 is wrecked with smoke still billowing out of the engine			2
@entity3 's @entity10 is up in flames			1
the @entity209 is touring round the track , and he makes it back to the pit - lane but he has to jump out of his car			1
the marshals are quickly on the scene and extinguish the fire , but that means @entity3 will start at the very back for tomorrow 's race			1
you could n't make it up			0
what rotten luck for the @entity209			2
pastor @entity219 pulls off the track in his @entity244 with yet another mechanical error for the troubled team			0
it looked as though the @entity248 , who has already signed on with @entity244 for next season , completely lost drive			0
how many more mechanical failures can that team have ? the light goes green in @entity5 and a gaggle of cars head on to the track			2
the midfield runners head out on the harder tyre			0
the @entity260 are now reporting a 30 per cent chance of rain during qualifying			0
we get underway in a little over five minutes ... @entity265 has been speaking following his blast at the @entity268 media in friday 's press conference			1
' i stand by everything i said yesterday			0
we should n’t be talking the sport down the whole time			0
the drivers have got to be the heroes and thereafter the cars should be second to that			0
we need to give more access to the drivers and the fans have got to be able to engage with the drivers			0
' @entity280 is sporting an arm brace in the paddock this weekend after fracturing his wrist in a cycling crash earlier this week			0
@entity280 was taking part in a team building exercise with his @entity10 colleagues , but it turned in to somewhat of a farce after @entity280 ’s injuries , @entity290 suffering bruising and race engineer @entity292 cracking three ribs			1
stick to four wheels , chaps			0
the circuit is currently bathed in summer sunshine , but to the south of the track it certainly looks as though there are some dark clouds gathering			0
we 've got 30 minutes until the start of today 's qualifying session ... @entity160 has apologised in person to all at @entity195 following his derogatory remarks made in the wake of sunday 's @entity45 @entity34			1
debut on the 2016 @entity268 calendar			2
a move for @entity310 , the capital city , to host the race was first revealed by @entity312 in march			0
@entity313 team principal @entity265 launched an astonishing tirade against the @entity268 media on friday			2
my aim heading to @entity45 was firstly to extend my lead in the championship over @entity3 , and then win what is my second home race after @entity322 , so it was very special to win for myself and for @entity10 as it is one of the most important grands prix on the calendar for the team			1
@entity3 was quickest in both sessions in friday 's practice sessions for sunday 's @entity34 on a demanding track where he has won four times ; his team - mate @entity27 was second			1
@entity3 has endured somewhat of a qualifying nightmare of late			1
indeed , it ’s been five races since the @entity209 stuck his mercedes on pole			1
but where better to end his current one - lap hoodoo then @entity5 ? the 29 - year - old is a specialist in @entity5 , winning in his debut year in 2007 , then again in 2009 in a dog of a @entity87 , in 2012 , and claiming his first victory in a @entity10 last term			1
@entity3 was fastest once more this morning , meaning he has topped the timesheets in every practice session so far at the @entity12 ahead of team - mate and his rival for the title @entity27			1
@entity27 is 14 points ahead of @entity3 heading into tomorrow ’s race after victory at the @entity45 @entity34 last time out			1
@entity3 will be desperate to close the gap ahead of the four - week summer break .			1

@entity3 out of qualifying after his @entity10 catches fire
it means he will start at the very back for tomorrow 's @entity360 @entity34
@entity27 secured third straight pole and he will start ahead of @entity36 and @entity37
@entity189 knocked out of qualifying in @entity192 . he *'ll* start 17th tomorrow
@entity3 has n't been on pole since the @entity367 @entity34
he has won four times in @entity5 in 2007 , 2009 , 2012 and 2013
the @entity209 is 14 points adrift of @entity27 in @entity268 's title race
