@entity0 could face @entity1 without any senior strikers and their captain following a costly 1 - 0 victory at @entity5			1
forward @entity6 suffered a calf injury in the warm - up at the @entity9 and skipper @entity10 suffered a recurrence of a hamstring problem 77 minutes into his comeback			1
@entity6 joins fellow strikers @entity14 and @entity16 on the sidelines and there is little chance of any of them being fit in the next fortnight			0
@entity10 might also be out of action until the new year			1
@entity0 captain @entity10 feels his leg before being substituted on saturday the @entity25 defender returned to the squad after missing three matches because of a hamstring problem @entity10 down injured in what could be a serious blow to @entity0 's title chances manager @entity32 said : ' it is difficult immediately after the game to know what happened to both of them			1
' @entity10 has the same problem in his hamstring he had a few weeks ago , that is one of the reasons he did n't play on wednesday in @entity42			1
' @entity6 felt a muscle injury in his calf			2
maybe he will also be a couple of weeks out			0
i think it is impossible ( for him to return ) before the new year			0
' we will see with @entity10 how hard his injury is but i think it will be very difficult for them to play before the next year			1
' @entity6 had made only two appearances since returning from another calf injury while @entity16 , who was a substitute in wednesday 's @entity54 win at @entity55 , has had niggly hamstring issues in recent weeks			1
@entity32 said : ' @entity16 also has a problem in his hamstring after the game against @entity42			1
it is not a very important injury but i think he will also need a couple of weeks			2
' top scorer @entity14 damaged knee ligaments in last weekend 's victory over @entity65 and could be sidelined for up to eight weeks			0
@entity10 applauds fans are he walks off injured during the @entity68 match on saturday @entity10 was forced off with an injury during the second half against @entity5 the problems forced @entity32 to draft 18 - year - old forward @entity72 into his starting line - up at @entity5 and the youngster could now get further chances			1
@entity32 said : ' we will see with @entity77			1
we have other young players in the squad @entity80 manages			0
we will see also another way to play but we are not going to complain about injuries			0
' the injuries marred @entity0 's latest victory in their @entity68 title defence , although their performance was far from a convincing one			2
@entity32 's men looked lethargic after their @entity54 exertions and only another goal from on - loan former @entity92 midfielder @entity91 separated the sides			2
@entity91 has now scored six goals since joining the club on a short - term loan from sister outfit @entity98 and his latest display is likely to increase @entity32 's desire to extend the deal beyond december			2
@entity32 said : ' there have been no serious discussions , but we know exactly what we must do			2
' @entity91 wants to stay , we want to keep him			0
now we must resolve the problem with @entity98 and @entity108			0
' he is very important			0
one of the reasons why he played today was because he has scored for me			0
@entity91 has been very useful for us in this moment			0

@entity0 captain missed last three matches *due* to hamstring injury
