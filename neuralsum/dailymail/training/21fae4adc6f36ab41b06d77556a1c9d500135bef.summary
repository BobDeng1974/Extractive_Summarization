@entity1 chief executive @entity0 is poised to receive an annual bonus package worth £ 160,000 from the cash - strapped @entity4 club			1
currently caught in the crossfire between potential rival saviours , @entity8 and @entity9 , the former @entity11 executive is entitled to a discretionary performance - related bonus of up to 100 per cent of his £ 315,000 annual salary			1
@entity1 sources have confirmed to @entity16 , however , that @entity0 has had a scaled down cash payment of £ 100,000 ratified by the board ’s remuneration committee			1
@entity1 chief executive @entity0 could be in line to receive a bonus worth £ 160,000 from the club in recognition of the club ’s perilous financial position , he has asked for a further £ 60,000 to be paid in market value shares in a move yet to be waved through by shareholders – one of whom , @entity9 , is seeking to remove @entity0 and financial director @entity30 from the board at an egm			1
the @entity33 are angered by @entity9 ’s moves to flex his muscles and last night accused the @entity36 of facilitating an abuse of their rules on dual ownership of football clubs			2
@entity9 , the billionaire owner of @entity42 , has increased the heat in the @entity4 boardroom by demanding the removal of @entity0 and @entity30			1
now in control of 8.9 per cent of @entity1 ’ shares , @entity9 ’s move is being viewed as a direct hit on two men sympathetic to seeing the club refinanced by sources other than the deep pockets of the sportswear tycoon			1
@entity0 is set to receive £ 100,000 in cash and £ 60,000 in shares from the cash - strapped @entity58 club @entity16 revealed yesterday that former directors @entity8 and @entity61 , together with shareholder @entity62 , are heading an investment group willing to sink an initial £ 16million into the club – in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue			1
it has been claimed however that , if successful , @entity9 ’s motion will scupper this potential source of investment			2
and last night , the @entity72 , the supporters ’ umbrella group , claimed @entity9 ’s actions this week made a mockery of @entity36 rules banning any individual from owning more than 10 per cent in two clubs			0
‘ the move by @entity9 to grab power in the @entity1 boardroom is extremely concerning , ’ a statement read			1
@entity9 is flexing his muscles with regards to @entity1 , demanding the removal of @entity0 from the club ‘ the @entity36 ’s special dispensation , which allowed mr @entity9 to purchase up to 10 per cent of the club , was clearly designed to mirror @entity90 rules on dual ownership			1
‘ these rules do not allow anyone to exert a “ decisive influence ” over the decision - making of two clubs			0
there can be no more obvious attempt to exert “ decisive influence ” over another club than to try remove its executive directors			2
‘ @entity102 and the previous board , as placemen for shareholders currently represented by @entity106 , have already allowed mr @entity9 to plunder the club for onerous merchandise contracts and virtually free stadium - naming rights			2
he also has full control of the club stores			0
‘ we firmly believe that it is mr @entity9 ’s intention to now attempt to grab ownership of the club ’s trademark rights including our name and badge			2
we believe he is deliberately attempting to hamper the efforts of others to invest in the club so that he can provide a loan on terms which will allow him to demand these trademark rights			0
@entity9 currently owns 8.9 per cent of the @entity58 club , but is interested in increasing that stake ‘ the @entity36 has a duty to @entity1 to rigorously enforce both its own and @entity90 rules on dual ownership			1
we believe mr @entity9 ’s @entity32 call is a breach of those rules and we have written to the @entity36 calling on them to take appropriate action			0
’ @entity1 striker @entity133 , meanwhile , will be available for the visit of @entity135 next saturday after a charge of violent conduct levelled against him in the wake of last month ’s defeat to @entity140 was found not proven			0
@entity133 had been offered a two - game suspension after being charged with an altercation with ‘ headbutting or attempting to headbutt an opposing player ’ but he opted to fight the charge			0
and a @entity145 was unable to prove his guilt in the incident involving @entity148			0
however , @entity4 defender @entity149 will serve a two - game suspension after accepting a violent conduct charge for swinging an arm at centre - back @entity153 in the same match			0
rangers are second in the @entity157 , six points behind @entity159 and two ahead of @entity135			0
