@entity0 , who knows a few things about winning @entity2 , has urged @entity3 not to be afraid to appoint a woman to his coaching staff if that is what he wants			1
the 18 - time major champion joined the debate sparked by @entity10 watching @entity3 ’s first - round @entity12 match , and well - sourced reports that the two of them have at least discussed a position working with him			1
‘ if @entity3 is thinking about having a woman like @entity10 then good for him , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ there is no reason why women can not coach men and they have the experience to coach a top player			0
why not ? girl power : @entity3 has been urged by @entity0 to sign up a woman as his next coach female intuition : @entity3 was watched by @entity10 during his first round match at the @entity12 ‘ it has not been done much before but that does not mean it would not work , it just has not been tried			1
if it is blocks of time then maybe that would be attractive			0
i do n’t know how the personalities match up with @entity3 but she has a lot of experience to pass on			2
‘ i would n’t do it because i have my academy and media work but it is good that @entity3 is looking at women for coaching			0
’ if @entity3 ever wanted evidence of @entity10 ’s motivational powers then he would only have to ask his fellow reigning @entity48 champion @entity47			1
the 2006 @entity48 winner and former world @entity51 was a major part of @entity47 ’s team when she stormed to unexpected glory at the @entity55 and that level of experience appears to have drawn @entity3 towards the 34 - year - old @entity58 in the wake of @entity61 ’s departure			1
neither @entity3 nor @entity10 was keen to discuss their prospective partnership yesterday , with the @entity3 camp declining to comment			2
man behind the man : @entity3 parted company with former coach @entity61 ( r ) earlier this year golden girl : @entity0 won 18 @entity2 during her illustrious career @entity10 played down the possibility of it becoming reality , but separate sources insist that there has been discussion between them about the post			1
@entity3 — who faces @entity78 @entity77 on thursday — understandably keeps his blinkers on during @entity2 and prefers to squash potential outside distractions			2
it could well be that if he feels comfortable at @entity12 with just his trusty lieutenant @entity83 by his side there will be no appointment but @entity10 seems to have been in his @entity86 raises the interesting question of how much impact a woman can have in the macho world of men ’s tennis			2
@entity0 was not alone in being fascinated by why @entity10 should spend so much time watching @entity3 , as highlighted in @entity94			1
‘ it is interesting that @entity10 went to watch his entire match			0
i ca n’t think why she would do that , ’ she said			0
head over heels : @entity10 coached @entity47 to her 2013 @entity48 victory from @entity101 with love : @entity103 is coached by his wife @entity104 another former @entity12 champion , @entity105 , felt the same , telling the @entity106 : ‘ anything is possible			1
i did notice that she was watching and i thought to myself , “ why is she watching his match ? ”			0
’ there are not many female coaches in professional tennis , with most women opting to be guided by men and a major consideration there is that they want the power that a male hitting partner — which many coaches double up as — can provide as the best means of training			0
with @entity3 it can be argued that the best coach he ever had was his mother @entity127			2
against the odds and from a remote outpost of the sport , she managed to equip both him and his brother @entity131 with the tools to make it in the professional game			0
there is actually an example already of female - on - male coaching in the men ’s top 100			0
@entity103 , the world no 54 from @entity101 , is coached by his wife @entity104 , who began the job when they were courting			1
' @entity143 ' and @entity144 : @entity3 will face @entity77 in his next match at @entity12 @entity10 has been among the groundbreakers in this area			1
she was alongside another @entity58 , @entity148 , over the grass - court season of 2010 when he won the men ’s title at @entity152			0
her tv commitments at the @entity2 have decreased since last year but she would certainly find herself on screen enough were she to replace @entity61			0
around mid-afternoon on thursday @entity3 faces world no 66 @entity77			2
although he rejoices in the nickname ‘ @entity143 ’ he ought not to hold too many terrors on clay in a best - of - five - sets match .			0

@entity10 sparked *rumours* by watching @entity3 at the @entity12
