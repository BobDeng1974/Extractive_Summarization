‘ the general feeling of the whole thing was that he was treating me badly			0
the @entity114 picked up on it			0
’ elsewhere during the interview by @entity161 , @entity3 responded to @entity18 ’s comment that his book was ‘ a work of fiction ’ by insisting that the retired spinner was at the heart of the bullying culture that he claims was rife in the @entity13 dressing room			1

i do n't even want to give it any thought ' ‘ @entity186 lost it in @entity188 , he started screaming at @entity18 and @entity19 because they kept going at him			2

‘ but when it is run from inside the dressing room , as i was led to believe , then it paints a very different picture			2
these are guys you go to battle with , these are guys you share the dressing room with for days and days , years and years , and then i get this feeling of total horror that i find out this is going on			0
’ yet there is a strong feeling within @entity221 cricket that @entity3 is exaggerating the extent of his hurt at the parody , which the players strongly deny being involved in , to somehow excuse his texts about @entity64 which came at the same time			0
@entity3 did not dispute the contents of the dossier but said : ‘ it ’s embarrassing , they could n’t even spell @entity229 ’s name right			2
