nearly 30,000 cautions were handed to criminals in @entity10 for offences including robbery , drug smuggling and even rape			1
they made up a quarter of the 118,000 crimes counted as solved by police in the capital during those 12 months			0
lenient : hundreds of serious crimes are punished by nothing more than a warning from police in @entity10 critics said the public and police are being short - changed by a rampant ‘ cautions culture ’ which lets off serious criminals			1
the figures , revealed by a @entity31 request , showed the @entity32 issued 28,998 cautions and youth warnings last year			1
among the cautions were 5,843 for violent attacks , 165 for sexual offences and , astonishingly , five for rape			1
a total of 180 offenders were cautioned for grievous bodily harm or wounding , 131 for robbery and 318 for drug trafficking			1

cautions : @entity32 officers handed out a slap on the wrist for a quarter of all crimes ( file photo ) last month , policing minister @entity62 announced a review of guidelines for issuing police cautions as part of a wider crackdown			2
mr @entity62 said the government ’s goal was to see the use of cautions restricted to ensure serious criminals would never escape punishment			2
the review , due to report next month , will examine whether cautions should be banned for some offences			2
there are fears that victims of violent and even sexual crimes are subject to a postcode lottery where attackers in some areas are more than twice as likely to escape with a caution			0
ministers are also concerned at the way repeat offenders receive cautions for multiple crimes			2
crackdown : ministers are hoping to discourage the use of cautions by @entity93 and other police forces @entity95 , a @entity96 politician in @entity10 who uncovered the data , said justice was not being done and those who receive cautions ‘ escape punishment ’			1
a @entity32 spokesman said the force follows national guidance and cautions are issued only in the case of serious offences after discussions with prosecutors			0
he said the force ‘ supports ’ the use of cautions , which are mostly used to deal with first - time offenders			0
he added : ‘ a caution is a serious matter , which can have significant consequences for the person ’s future employment			0

@entity93 gave out 30,000 cautions in a year - some for serious crimes
