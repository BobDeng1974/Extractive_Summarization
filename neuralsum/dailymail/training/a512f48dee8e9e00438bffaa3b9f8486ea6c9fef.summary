by @entity1 reporter published : 00:56 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 10:07 est , 24 august 2013 the chairman of the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity2 has implemented a new no smoking policy for adult residents similar to those implemented in many college dormitories			1
only difference is those impacted by the new rule are n't 18 - year - old co-eds - in one case , it 's a 90 - year - old @entity16 veteran who has been told he and his 90 - year - old wife who has severe @entity19 are being evicted from the apartment where they 've lived for 20 years because he has been busted smoking cigarettes on a breezeway rather than in a designated picnic area away from the building			1
@entity26 , who won a @entity27 and two @entity28 during the war , was a combat infantryman fighting the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
the @entity35 is where he picked up his smoking habit 70 years ago , as @entity38 provided soldiers with free cigarettes during the war			1
war hero : @entity26 enjoys a cigarette in front of the apartment he and his wife are about to be evicted from habit : @entity26 started smoking while fighting the @entity30			1
he says he 's tried to quit but ca n't now that habit has cost him his home			0
' it 's like they 're going to turn this into a concentration camp , ' @entity26 told the @entity54 as he smoked a cigarette in his rolling chair that he had to wheel the appropriate distance from his apartment in a senior living center in @entity60			2
' i do n't know why they singled me out			0
' @entity63 , mr. @entity26 's daughter , has no idea where her parents will go if they are forced from their $ 714 - a - month apartment - the couple lives on a small , fixed income			1
additionally , mr. @entity26 's wife , @entity69 , is in the very late stages of @entity19 's - most of the time , she barely even recognizes her husband of nearly 70 years			1
ms. @entity63 and @entity73 - a state senator who is acting as the @entity26 's attorney free of charge - are urging the @entity4 to make an exception in mr. @entity26 's case because of his age , immobility and war record			1
new policy : the smoking restrictions were put in place at @entity60 apartments in january 2012 ' personally , i could n't sleep at night evicting a 90 - year - old war hero from government - subsidized housing , ' @entity73 said			1
' it 's just totally incredible to me that we ca n't find an exception to the rules			0
i think common sense should prevail and let mr. @entity26 live out his life because of what he did for all of us			1
' the town 's mayor has even stepped in , also urging the @entity4 to come up with some sort of compromise that would allow the @entity99 to stay in their apartment			2
however , the town has no control over the independent @entity4			2
' i fully agree that you should n't smoke , ' @entity5 mayor @entity104 said , ' but the man is 90 years old			0
there 's got to be some way to compromise so that he wo n't have to leave the home where he 's been for 20 years			0
every issue is n't black and white			0
' the @entity4 does n't seem to want to budge , though - chairman @entity111 and executive director @entity112 say that making an exception to the rule - implemented about 18 months ago - is n't going to happen			1
compromise : state senator @entity73 is acting as the @entity26 's attorney and hopes he can come to a compromise that allows the couple to stay in their home ' once you start that , where do you end that ? ' @entity111 said			2
' we made a decision that 's in the best interests of the health and safety of the tenants			0
we really feel there is n't room for making an exception on this particular issue			0
' when asked about mr. @entity26 's mobility issues , @entity133 told the paper ' he has a walker and a scooter - he gets around the property pretty well			1
' mr. @entity26 said he 's tried quitting before , but simply ca n't			1
' are you kidding ? ' he said			0
' i got the best doctor in the world			0
he gave me the patch			2
' @entity145 is the attorney representing the @entity4 when the @entity26 's case is heard on september 3			2
he said he expects a mediation session prior to the hearing			0
' can a compromise be reached ? ' @entity145 said			0
' we 're not in court yet			0
i 'm looking forward to meeting with sen. @entity73 to see if we can find an agreement satisfactory to both parties			0

@entity26 started smoking in the @entity35 when the @entity156 government gave him free cigarettes as he fought the @entity30 in @entity158 and @entity31
