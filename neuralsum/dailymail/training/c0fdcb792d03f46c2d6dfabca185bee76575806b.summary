by @entity0 published : 09:15 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 8 february 2013 as a goldfish , the last you need is a problem swimming			0
but fortunately for @entity6 , her caring owner came to the rescue with an ingenious solution after a disability left her stranded at the bottom of he tank			1
the beloved pet was given a tiny life - belt contraption that now allows @entity6 to happily swim around like all her friends			1
in a message under the video , synirr says : ' my disabled goldfish scooting around in her newly redesigned sling			0
she has trouble maintaining buoyancy on her own			0
' she looks a little silly , but it is better than lying at the bottom of the tank all day ! ' and footage in which @entity6 happily takes food from her owner 's hand is captioned : ' have to make sure she 's getting enough to eat			1
she is very tame : ) ' buoyancy problems are fairly common among goldfish and can cause them to either float on the surface or sink to the bottom of the tank			2
the cause of this imbalance is due to complications with their swim bladder , a two - chambered air sack located in their body cavity that enables them to keep balance while they are not moving			1
gloating about floating : footage of @entity6 happily swimming around her tank has become a hit on @entity36 disabled : @entity6 's owner says she has trouble maintaining her own buoyancy , which could have been caused by a problem with her swim bladder problems can occur for any number of reasons including sudden changes in temperature , pressure from food or air in the stomach , and infections			1
the condition can often be treated by changing the goldfish 's diet as the problem usually arises from its eating habits			2
owners are advised not to overfeed their fish and to try alternative floating or slow - sinking granular foods			2
it is also suggested changing the water or adding tonic salt to help reduce stress on the fish			0
if none of these measures work , it may be that the fish has permanent damage			0
but they can often live to a good age regardless , particularity if you have the added help your very own buoyancy aid .			0

@entity6 was stranded at the bottom of her owner 's tank due to a disability
it now has its own ' water - wing ' , allowing it to swim again
