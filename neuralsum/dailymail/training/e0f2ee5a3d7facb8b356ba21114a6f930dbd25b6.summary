while at large he was placed on the list of @entity18 ’s most wanted criminals after being sentenced to seven years in jail in his absence for running a branch of the @entity1			1
he was head of a crime family involved in extortion , racketeering and drug trafficking , police said			1

a note with the bullets read : ' one is for your head , one for your heart			2
' one is for the coup de grace			0
this is your final warning			0
' @entity18 detectives knew he was living in @entity2 under a false identity but could not intervene because the crime of ‘ mafia association ’ is not recognised by authorities in @entity51			1
the situation is understood to have changed significantly to have allowed @entity51 police to raid his home in @entity56 , @entity2 , on wednesday evening			1
when officers arrived at his front door he tried to escape though the back gate			0
but a detective constable was waiting there and arrested him			0
yesterday he appeared at @entity63 ’ court where a lawyer for the @entity18 government called for him to be extradited to serve his prison sentence			1
however , he could go free today because of ‘ significant deficiencies ’ in the warrant for his arrest			0
born in @entity35 , @entity36 , in 1949 , @entity0 was the son of a mafia boss called @entity73 , who was later jailed for life			1
@entity18 police say he was involved in the so - called @entity86 30 years ago			1
he was known as a ‘ man of honour ’ in the @entity1 or ‘ @entity1 ’ group which controlled the @entity35 district of @entity92 , the court heard			0
@entity0 was jailed in his absence in 1999 for being part of a criminal organisation between 1987 and 1995			1
@entity96 , a @entity1 supergrass , told @entity99 newspaper : ‘ @entity0 is dangerous , i can assure you			1
i know , because i raised him			0
’ by the time he was convicted he was already thriving in his new life with his wife @entity102 , 60 , the daughter of a former @entity18 consul to @entity2 , and their children @entity73 , 36 , and @entity77 , 33			1
sources said @entity0 was ‘ living a golden life ’ in @entity51 and was often seen driving @entity108 and @entity109 cars			1
last night neighbours expressed surprise that he had chosen their neighbourhood to live in			2
one said : ‘ people do n’t hide out in @entity56 , not even the @entity1			1
’ home : this is the house in @entity56 , @entity2 where fugitive mafia boss @entity0 had been living with his wife and two children until he was arrested last night @entity119 , 76 , said : ‘ i know him very well and he ’s one of the best neighbours you could ever have			1
‘ they have been here for years			2
i ’ve seen the children grow up with my children			0
i do n’t know the ins and outs of this , but they are the nicest people that you could wish to meet			0
’ the @entity1 , or @entity1 , which translates into @entity132 as ' our thing ' , emerged in the mid- 19th century and is still going strong			1
it is not one single organisation , instead it is made up of around 100 families who each run a territory on the island , either a district of a city , a town or a few villages			2
its stronghold is @entity35 , the capital of the @entity36 region , and the areas surrounding it , where at least half of all members are based			1
their power grew from protection , racketeering and extortion , because of the number of traders and landowners there to exploit			0
in more recent times , much of their money has come from the smuggling of cigarettes and drugs like heroin to @entity166 and @entity167			0
in the post-war era the @entity18 authorities fought against the @entity1 , but even after a series of huge court cases the families could n't be broken			2
according to @entity174 , the chief prosecutor of @entity35 , there are still 94 @entity1 families on @entity36 , with between 3,500 to 4,000 mobsters			2
tennis coach @entity179 , 53 , said : ‘ as far as i can tell he seemed a nice guy – quiet , reserved and polite			0
he would always say hello or wave			0
he would always go out dressed nicely , he was either in a very sharp suit or smart casual			0
‘ he was your typical southern @entity166			0
he had dark hair , greased down and very sharp			0
there was no real weight on him , he looked in good shape for his age			0
’ according to @entity18 media , @entity0 lived openly in @entity2 and considered himself untouchable because his conviction was apparently not recognised under @entity51 law			1
he was remanded in custody yesterday , but could walk free today because of ‘ deficiencies ’ surrounding the warrant for his arrest			0

he was eventually nabbed by the @entity267 in @entity268 , near @entity269 , his power base in @entity36			2
it prompted then - premier @entity272 to say the arrest was the latest evidence of the government 's ' unprecedented success ' in cracking down on organised crime			0
it came as @entity280 police arrested dozens of suspected mobsters that summer , including @entity282 , from the @entity251 crime syndicate in southern @entity18 , who was believed to have taken the helm of the @entity250 clan , a ruthless group responsible for murders , extortion and other trafficking - though police said he showed no resistance to his arrest			2

@entity0 's arrest is not the first time someone with links to the @entity1 has been held in @entity132			1
in 2007 , housewife @entity332 , from @entity333 , agreed to be extradited where @entity18 authorities wanted her to stand trial as one of 88 people accused over alleged @entity1 activities			2
