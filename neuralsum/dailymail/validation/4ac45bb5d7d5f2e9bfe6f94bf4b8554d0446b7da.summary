it is the dream of many young children , the chance to be sheriff of their very own @entity3 town			0
and it seems wannabe cowboys can make that dream come true after an entire @entity3 town went up for sale in @entity11 , with a guide price of $ 900,000 ( £ 600,000 )			0
for buyers who want to recreate their very own @entity15 , the town boasts a general store , a saloon and a jail , as well as a real residence			2
the @entity20 in @entity11 even has an on - site barbershop , but you might have to hire in a professional with the ticket office temporarily closed , there does n't look like being any outward train journeys out of the @entity3 the two - bedroom house is ready to move in , and is decked out in beautiful @entity3 memorabilia on @entity29 stands the @entity30 , where you can tie your horse up outside and get the day 's necessities and wannabe sheriffs can also set up home in the town as there 's a house two - bedroom house ready to move into			2
the town in @entity41 , @entity42 , has been used for advertising and movies and is now up for grabs to be turned into a family home			1
all of the buildings - including a blacksmiths , a barbershop and a print shop have been furnished with @entity15 antiques collected over the last 60 years			1
and the town 's residential property has a stone fireplace and two wood burning stoves			1
the interior is linked back to the days of rodeo and gunfights of the @entity3 , but the furniture is exquisite and tasteful those who did n't obey the strict laws in the @entity3 often met a grisly end - thankfully this graveyard is just an added ' decoration ' the @entity66 in @entity11 will cost $ 900,000 ( £ 600,000 ) and will provide a truly unique living experience a quick dust around and you could make this your sheriff 's office in the town found in @entity41 , @entity42 @entity41 is well in tune with its @entity3 history			1
once a year , parts of the town are closed down for an event known as @entity77			0
this event is traditionally held over the @entity78 weekend and consists of a community parade , a festival at the @entity81 and the @entity82			0
@entity83 ! for anyone who misbehaves , they may find themselves ' in the slammer ' , but at least they will get a bed to sleep on on taking over the town , the ticket office can finally open for business at @entity93 after a hard day riding your horse around the plains , what better way to relax than have a beer in your own saloon the interior of the bar is a tribute to the @entity3 , but you might have to share a table with the @entity108 chief seated left for the weeks leading up to the event , local organizations put on western - themed events and fundraisers			2
so there 's no excuse after buying this property to be caught short when getting involved in the celebrations .			0
