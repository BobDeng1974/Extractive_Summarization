they are as industrious as @entity1 and possess the same social intelligence as a colony of termites			0
a crew of self - organising robots created by @entity8 scientists can construct towers , castles and pyramids without any supervision or detailed instructions			1
it is hoped the study of the co-operative bots is a small step towards a time when autonomous robots could build real structures on @entity21 and even on other planets			1
scroll down for @entity23 sociable : scientists have created a crew of self - organising robots ( pictrued ) that can construct towers , castles and pyramids without any supervision or detailed instructions @entity32 bots are given an overall idea of what the finished job should look like , before being left to get on with it			1
all that guides them are signals from infrared and ultrasound sensors and simple ' traffic ' rules that determine whether to go or stop			1
@entity32 bots require no centralised controller or complex system to talk to each other			1
the bots use infrared sensors to detect black and white patterns on bricks , and sonar for navigation			1
they follow two sets of rules			2
one determines how a robot makes its next move and applies to any structure being built			2
the other consists of ' traffic laws ' that correspond to a specific structure			0
the traffic laws tell robots at any position which sites they are allowed to go to next and maintain a constant flow of robots and material through the structure			2
safety checks performed by the bots mean they do not get stranded and work with each other			0
each @entity32 bots are given an overall idea what the finished job should look like before being left to get on with it , researchers said			1
all that guides them are signals from infrared and ultrasound sensors and simple ' traffic ' rules that determine whether to go or stop			1
they also know when to lift a building brick and where to attach it , as well as how to avoid collisions and even how to reach higher levels by constructing staircases			0
while the robots are just over 6 - inches long and the building bricks are made of lightweight foam , the scientists are impressed by what their creations are capable of			1
in future , similar autonomous machines could be used to build full - scale structures for human use , possibly in dangerous settings where it might be difficult for humans to work from earthquake shelters and underwater habitats on @entity21 to bases on the moon or @entity105			1
the future of construction ? all that guides the @entity32 robots are signals from infrared and ultrasound sensors and simple ' traffic ' rules that determine whether to go or stop termites have long amazed experts with their ability build			1
millions of the insects co-operate to manufacture their mounds , which can stand 8ft tall ( pictured ) ' the key inspiration we took from termites is the idea that you can do something really complicated as a group , without a supervisor and secondly that you can do it without everybody discussing explicitly what 's going on , but just by modifying the environment , ' said @entity8 computer scientist professor @entity126 , from @entity127			1
termites have long amazed experts with their ability build			0
millions of the insects co-operate to manufacture their mounds , which can stand 8ft tall and act as sophisticated air conditioning systems for nests			0
inside each mound is a complex system of tunnels and shafts and unlike human builders , termites need no detailed blueprints from which to work , instead relying on a process called ‘ stigmergy ’ - a kind of implicit communication			0
they observe each other interacting with the environment and act accordingly in a way that , scaled up , looks intelligent			0
the @entity32 bots employ the same principle			1
in contrast to other working robots , such as those in car factories , they require no centralised controller or complex system of talking to each other			0
each robot has a set of wheels and a single lifting arm with a spring - loaded gripper			0
the bots use infrared sensors to detect black and white patterns on the bricks , and sonar for navigation			1
despite their small size , scientists are highly impressed by what their creations are capable of			0
in the future , similar autonomous machines could be used to build full scale structures for human use , possibly in dangerous settings where it might be difficult for humans to work just two kinds of rules ensure the building project does not descend into chaos			2
one determines how a robot makes its next move and applies to any structure being built			2
the other consists of ' traffic laws ' that correspond to a specific structure , according to the study , which is published in the journal @entity188			0
the traffic laws tell robots at any position which sites they are allowed to go to next and maintain a constant flow of robots and material through the structure			2
' if they built carelessly , it would be easy for them to build in a way where they got stuck , ' said team member dr @entity201 , from the @entity202 in @entity203 , @entity8 ' the safety checks involve a robot looking at the sites immediately around itself , paying attention to where the bricks already are and where others are supposed to be and making sure certain conditions in that local area are satisfied			1
' ' the key inspiration we took from termites is the idea that you can do something really complicated as a group , without a supervisor , and secondly that you can do it without everybody discussing explicitly what 's going on , but just by modifying the environment , ' said professor @entity126 , from @entity127 one of the key advantages of the system is that it is not dependent on a set number of interactive units working together , dr @entity201 explained			2
' individual robots can break down but the rest can carry on			0
there 's no one critical element that brings everything down if one fails , ’ he said			0
during the study , the scientists filmed the robots recovering from unexpected changes made to the structures they were building			2
' when many agents get together , whether they 're termites , bees or robots , often some interesting , higher - level behaviour emerges that you would n't predict from looking at the components themselves , ' dr @entity201 said			0
' broadly speaking , we 're interested in connecting what happens at the low level , with individual agent rules , to these emergent outcomes			0

scientists from @entity127 and the @entity202 in @entity203 , @entity8 built the self - organising robots
@entity32 bots are guided by signals from infrared and ultrasound sensors
they can build model towers , castles and pyramids without supervision
they also follow ' traffic ' rules that determine whether they should move
it is hoped the research will lead to structures built autonomously on @entity21
