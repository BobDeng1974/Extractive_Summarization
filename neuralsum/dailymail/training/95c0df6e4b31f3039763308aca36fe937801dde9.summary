as @entity1 prepares to face @entity2 with @entity3 this weekend , we asked @entity5 's @entity4 five questions about the @entity7			1
will he be booed ? will he celebrate ? and was @entity8 right to stick with @entity9 rather than bring @entity1 back ? @entity1 will play for @entity3 against @entity2 at @entity10 this sunday @entity1 learnt his trade and @entity2 and was the club captain ... here are the questions that need answering how do you feel about seeing @entity1 in @entity3 blue and how will the majority of @entity2 fans react to him at @entity10 ? it ’s been hard to watch @entity1 in the @entity3 strip and even harder to see him doing so well			1
you do n’t get many more loathed teams or indeed fans at the @entity24 than those who sport the blue			0
but should we feel distaste towards the @entity7 ? no. he wanted a move back to @entity30 , and @entity2 did n’t want him			0
what did we expect him to do ? @entity32 ? come on , he wants to win trophies			0
but forget @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and the rest … this reunion is the one which will hurt the @entity2 fans the most			1
it 's been hard to watch @entity1 in the @entity3 strip ... but there was nothing else he could have done forget @entity35 , this reunion will hurt the most for @entity48 fans if he scores , do you expect him to celebrate , or show respect like @entity51 did to @entity3 supporters at @entity53 ? i think you ’ve got more chance of seeing @entity56 score the perfect hat - trick than @entity1 celebrating a goal against the club who made him what he is today			1
he ’s admitted he is still a gooner at heart and would rather have donned the red of @entity2 this season than the blue of @entity3 after quitting @entity67 ; that ’s probably why the @entity3 fans do n’t like him very much			2
let ’s just say that if he does do the unthinkable and score against his former employers , i ’m confident he wo n’t do an ‘ @entity77 ’ and sprint the length of the pitch before sliding on his knees to antagonise the away fans			0
he ’s better than that			0
@entity51 was respectful after scoring against @entity3 ... expect the same from @entity1 @entity1 is a gooner at heart and would have rejoined the club were he to have the chance there will be no chance of @entity1 replicating @entity77 and running the length of the pitch ... what are your favourite memories of @entity1 in an @entity2 shirt ? giving the @entity92 trio of @entity93 , @entity94 and his mentor @entity95 the runaround at @entity97 before scoring and then teeing up @entity99 in @entity2 ’s 2 - 0 win in the @entity101 last eight will be somewhere near the top of the list			1
‘ he ’s only 18 , he ’s better than @entity105 , ’ sung the @entity2 fans , and he certainly came of age that night			2
staying in @entity109 his late spot - kick against @entity67 – scored on one leg after sustaining an injury winning the penalty – as @entity2 rallied back from two goals down to draw 2 - 2 at the @entity24 in 2010			0
and , who can forget his solo strike against @entity117 where he snatched the ball on the halfway line to score against the arch enemy ? @entity1 had many great moments at @entity2 : including this when he gave @entity92 the runaround in 2006 @entity1 scored a penalty despite an injury against hometown club @entity67 in 2010 the captain ran from the halfway line to score against archrivals @entity117 in the same year are @entity2 better with – or without – @entity1 in their midfield ? this is a difficult question			1
we never wanted him to leave ; he was our captain , talisman , and fans ’ favourite , but how many medals can the @entity7 claim to have won at @entity2 ? a solitary @entity138 triumph in 2005 , and that was a fortunate win , on penalties against a @entity143 side far superior on the day			1
undoubtedly a star player , who stood head and shoulders above his peers , but he is also one who personified a different @entity8 era – a move away from the power of @entity153 , @entity95 , @entity154 and one built around slighter , diminutive players – albeit as skilful – but which ultimately has proved to be nowhere near as successful			0
@entity1 only won one trophy at @entity2 , the @entity138 after a penalty shoot - out in 2005 his rise saw a move away from the physical side brought to the club by @entity95 @entity9 or @entity1 ? who would you rather have directing operations for your team right now ? based on current form @entity165 , but is he a better player than @entity9 ? i ’m not sure			1
is his game more suited to the @entity169 , however ? probably			0
that said i understand why @entity8 did n’t move for @entity1 in the summer			2
he and @entity9 could not have played in the same side , and when you ’ve spent a club record fee on a player why would you undermine that by bringing in someone who lines up in the same position ? nor can we forget @entity180 ’s breakthrough campaign last year			2
would it have been as a step back to sign @entity1 ? i think so			0
nevertheless , he ’s still a class act , a player who has delivered consistently in @entity185 , whether it was at @entity2 or now in the early stages of his career at @entity3 , and oozes star quality			2
let ’s hope he has an off - day on sunday			0
@entity9 is as good a player as @entity1 if not better , but the latter is better suited to the @entity169 a move for @entity1 would have been a step backwards ... @entity8 has done all he can			1
