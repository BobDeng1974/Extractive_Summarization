one of @entity1 ’s biggest landowners has joined sir @entity2 in attacking the @entity3 for wasting millions of pounds in donations and failing to protect wildlife			1
@entity6 , who was at @entity8 school with prince @entity9 , has erected signs across his 50,000 - acre @entity12 and @entity13 estate reading : ‘ @entity3 not welcome here either			1
’ in november , @entity15 published an open letter from sir @entity2 to the @entity3 , in which the former @entity19 cricket captain accused the charity of wasting millions of pounds worth of donations , being misleading in its marketing and proving ineffective at helping birds			1
they seem more intent on continuing to raise vast sums of money rather than performing their primary role of conservation and promoting the growth of protected species			2
‘ i admit it is years of frustration and anger boiling over			0
landowners , farmers and gamekeepers have always been an easy target , blamed by the society for the poisoning and shooting of raptors			0
but the @entity3 itself is doing damage			1
‘ they are so big and so powerful now , someone has to try to make them stop and think			0
if we can make them have a rethink , then at least we will have achieved something			0
’ mr @entity6 revealed that not everyone agrees with his protest ; two of his signs have been torn down , while another has been damaged			1
undeterred , the 70 - year - old , who has been joined by @entity64 of the @entity65 , says he has encouraged estates in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and the @entity70 to add their names to his campaign			2
mr @entity64 , who has erected two of the signs on his 18,000 - acre estate in @entity76 , said : ‘ the intention is to raise awareness of the fact there are some people who are unhappy about the way other people are being treated by the @entity3			1
i feel strongly about it			0
mr @entity85 said the @entity3 seem more intent on raising vast sums of money than their conservation role ‘ they seem to be getting out of control and spending an extraordinary amount of money on publicity			1
they seem to be going the same way as the @entity95 : taking as much trouble to stop hunting and other sporting activities that irritate them			0
‘ we have red kites and i was unaware that the @entity3 come and visit the sites			1
i ’ve got no objection to them coming but find it irritating to discover they have been driving around looking at things themselves			0
’ he added : ‘ as far as i can see they can do what they like			0
it rather suggests the @entity3 do n’t trust landowners to look after their land properly when we do so much for them			2
‘ i do n’t like it when people seem determined to try to catch us out rather than discuss any problems they have with us			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity3 said : ‘ while we would prefer a constructive dialogue with anyone who disagrees with our charitable work , it is of course the right of any individual to erect a sign on their private land expressing their opinion			2

@entity6 has erected signs *warning* the @entity3 they are not welcome
mr @entity6 , who has a 50,000 - acre estate said ' they are out of control '
the @entity1 landowner attended @entity8 school with prince @entity9
