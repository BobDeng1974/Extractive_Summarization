a new @entity1 study has warned teenagers who are deemed a ' healthy weight ' can still be suffering anorexia nervosa teenagers do not need to be severely underweight to be suffering from a life - threatening eating disorder , experts have warned			1
a dramatic drop in weight should be a cause for serious concern , suggesting an adolescent could be at risk of severe medical problems			2
a new study carried out at @entity1 's @entity16 noted a fivefold increase in the number of teenagers being admitted to hospital fulfilling all the criteria for anorexia nervosa - apart from being underweight			1
the researchers examined a six - year period from 2005 to 2010 , discovering more adolescents thought to be of ' normal weight ' were suffering the illness			1
despite not meeting the low weight criteria of the eating disorder , the teenagers were found to be suffering from acute , life - threatening medical complications of weight loss			1
professor @entity32 , director of @entity33 for @entity34 , said the research highlights that higher - weight adolescents who have lost a large amount of weight require careful medical assessment			2
' eating disorders can emerge at any weight , ' she said			1
' clinicians need to have a high level of suspicion about a possible restrictive eating disorder in all patients who have rapidly lost weight or lost a significant amount of weight — even if the young person is not underweight at the time they present			0
' there is poor understanding by health professionals , teachers and families of the risks of rapid , severe weight loss - at all weights			1
' most health professionals think " underweight " when they think of anorexia			0
' it is therefore not surprising that many of these adolescents were very unwell by the time they were eventually admitted to hospital			0
' lead researcher @entity66 said the dramatic increase in the proportion of adolescents admitted to hospital who were not yet underweight reflects increasing rates of obesity in adolescents			2
' obesity and eating disorders used to be considered as distinct health concerns with little overlap in patient populations , ' she said			2
' this data suggests that we need to be much more aware of the risks of eating disorders emerging in adolescents who are overweight			1
' the research showed that while some of the patients had been advised by a health professional to lose weight , none were being professionally supported to lose weight at the time they presented with an eating disorder			0
researchers said this highlights the need for supervision of appropriate weight loss efforts in overweight adolescents			1
professor @entity101 , said : ' regardless of their actual weight , clinicians consulting with adolescents who have lost a large amount of weight should , among other tasks , review the patient ’s weight loss strategies to ensure they are sustainable and safe			2
' they should also carefully assess the patient ’s cardiovascular health			0
researchers noted a fivefold increase in the number of teenagers being admitted to hospital fulfilling all the criteria for anorexia nervosa - apart from being underweight - from 2005 to 2010 ' for those adolescents who have rapidly lost a large amount of weight , anorexia nervosa should be considered			1
' researchers said that due to a combination of factors including the nature of eating disorders , lack of parental awareness , lack of training in health professionals , and delays in accessing specialist services , there are often significant delays in making the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa , even in adolescents who are very underweight			1
both researchers are part of the @entity143 program			0
the research was carried out by @entity145 , the @entity143 and the @entity146			0
eating disorder charity , @entity148 ’s chief executive , @entity147 , told @entity150 : ' eating disorders are complex mental illnesses that have serious effects on physical health too			0
it ’s very helpful to make people aware that eating disorders are not just about being very underweight			1
' we know you ca n’t tell if someone is ill just from the shape and size of their body			0
' we also know that sometimes a strict measure of @entity165 is used to decide if someone is eligible for specialist treatment			0
' this study shows how potentially dangerous that could be			0
