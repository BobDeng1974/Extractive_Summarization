by @entity1 reporter published : 14:10 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 16:54 est , 3 may 2013 the troubled city of @entity3 has the rather ominous distinction of being home to the three most violent neighborhoods in @entity7			1
the rankings come from a report of the 25 most dangerous neighborhoods released this week by @entity11			1
with its violent crimes , high unemployment , dwindling population and financial crisis , @entity3 was always a likely candidate to feature on such a list , but not only does it take the top three spots , it also has a neighborhood in the seventh spot too			0
new research to find the most dangerous neighborhoods in the entire country has found the top three are all within the troubled city of @entity3 four @entity26 neighborhoods also featured on the list , while the remainder were mainly smaller cities in the @entity30 and @entity31			1
@entity33 's founder @entity32 said the findings - in particular the absence of @entity36 and @entity37 - might surprise many people			2
‘ so many people think , well , i live in a medium city so it ca n't be that bad , not like big cities like @entity36 or @entity37 , ’ said @entity32			2
' but those cities are n't that dangerous overall - of course they have dangerous neighborhoods - but overall , they are n't nearly as dangerous as places like @entity47			2
' @entity48 analyzed @entity50 data tracking violent crimes of homicide , forcible rape , armed robbery and aggravated assault to compile this list broken city : @entity3 suffers from violent crime , high unemployment , a dwindling population and financial crisis @entity48 used census tracts to define neighborhoods , excluding those with less than 800 residents			1
then they analyzed @entity50 data tracking violent crimes of homicide , forcible rape , armed robbery and aggravated assault			0
@entity32 also noted that rather than city centers , the neighborhoods found to have the highest incidents of crime also had high levels of vacancies and were dominated by single - family homes			1
while @entity3 is well known as an area of economic blight and major social issues and the number of vacant structures is estimated at 35,000 , with many more vacant lots			0
the city 's violent crime rate is also more than five times the national average , according to last year 's @entity86 analysis of 2011 statistics			1
in february @entity3 earned another dubious honor when it topped @entity86 ’ list of the most miserable cities in the @entity7 ghost town : a wrecking crew tears down an abandoned building that once housed @entity94 from 1960 - 1972 on @entity95 in downtown @entity3 ‘ @entity3 's problems are hardly news			1
it has been in a four - decade decline paralleling the slide in the @entity7 auto industry , ’ according to @entity86 , which compiles the yearly ranking			1
earlier this year , a panel of experts said the automotive city was facing a fiscal emergency and potential bankruptcy , as well as a possible financial takeover by the state			2
once hailed as one of the nation ’s most industrious cities , @entity3 has been ravaged by a perfect storm of plummeting home prices , astronomically high crime rates and a mass exodus of residents			0
violent crime in the @entity3 metro division was down 5 per cent in 2011 , but it remains the highest in the country with 1,052 violent crimes per 100,000 people , according to the @entity50			0
mayor @entity122 responded to @entity86 in a statement : ‘ there is no question that @entity3 has many challenges			0
with all due respect to the data in this report , @entity3 is in the midst of a transformation			0
‘ that transformation is being driven by my restructuring plan , which is focused on four key areas : public safety ; public lighting ; public transportation ; and neighborhood blight removal			0
’ a woman walks next to the abandoned @entity141 building , that ceased production in the 1950 's , in @entity3			0

the troubled city is home to four of @entity7 's seven *roughest* neighborhoods
