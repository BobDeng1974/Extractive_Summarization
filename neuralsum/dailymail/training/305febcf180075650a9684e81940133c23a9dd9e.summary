by the time he died following treatment at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , the grandfather - of - four had developed pressure sores due to being bedbound and was said to look like a ' shadow of his former self			1
' tragedy : @entity8 and @entity23 on their 40th wedding anniversary			1
hospital staff were unable to recognise the retired engineer in this photo after he shed five stone in just five weeks following a fall in his back garden now after nearly a year of wrangling @entity4 bosses have apologised to mr @entity8 ’s family after admitting some of its work practises while he was being treated were ' inadequate and lacking			1
' mr @entity8 had been enjoying an active life regularly walking the dog and would love taking trips abroad with his wife @entity38 - climbing in @entity39 , and enjoying the cultures of @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
but in february last year he accidentally stumbled and fell as he was pottering in the garden of the home he shared with his wife in @entity46 , @entity16			2
after treatment at @entity15 , mr @entity8 was advised to undergo a six - week physiotherapy course at @entity49 , an intermediate care home run by the trust , because his damaged knee saw him struggling to get out of his armchair			1
but within weeks he developed painful pressure sores and became bed - bound while he was treated by @entity56 staff			1
he was sent back to @entity15 to a complex care ward because he was unwell			2
grieving : @entity23 , 86 , holds a picture of her late husband @entity8			1
the hospital has accepted there was inadequate communication with mr @entity8 and his family during his time in its care last year @entity23 , 86 , said : ' i had brought in a photograph of us to sit by @entity8 ’s bed to cheer him up			1
a member of staff was chatting to him and asked who was in the photo			0
@entity8 said " it ’s me " and the man did n’t believe him			1
' he looked so different because he ’d lost so much weight			2
he was n’t a person who liked having to rely on people , so it was frustrating to see him so helpless			0
' he would just have to lie there and look about him			0
he was deteriorating and i could see in his eyes it was as though he did n’t have anything to live for			0
' the couple ’s son @entity87 , 58 , said the family were not kept informed about deterioration in his father ’s condition and said notes and documents relating to his care were not completed properly			1
fall : mr @entity8 when he was 58 and an officer in the @entity97 he said : ' when my father went in for treatment , he was mobile but he came out on a stretcher and was taken back to hospital with two pressure sores that went through to the bone			1
after that he never got out of bed again			0
' i wish he had n’t gone in for physiotherapy in the first place - maybe he would still be here today			0
he was still getting about , he was struggling a bit because of his knee but he was still getting around the house			0
' they were obviously giving him the wrong diet because he had never suffered that in his life			2
when i saw him being lifted into the ambulance he looked just awful - they said it could be touch and go whether he ’d make it through the night			2
' we were never kept in the know about the problems he was having - the lack of paperwork and lack of communication between staff and relatives was disgraceful			0
' the complex care ward was a shambles and a joke			2
there was not enough staff to cover all the patients			0
' @entity133 put him on a liquid diet because he was unable to swallow because of dementia			1
but he hated the food - it was all mushed up and disgusting so he did n’t eat it			2
' they did n’t help him in any way , he would eat the bananas and yoghurts we would take in for him			0
he lost around five stones , he was so weak			0
but yet it was the mushed food or nothing			2
' eventually a doctor told his family that no more could be done for mr @entity8 ’s sores because the septicaemia had gone so deep , it was down to the bone - and the pensioner was discharged to go home			1
he died the following october			0
@entity87 said : ' i asked the doctor why on earth he developed the sores in the first place and he turned to me and said , " if you do n’t like the care then why do n’t you pay to put him in a home			1
" ' he also said the @entity4 was in a shambles because " some people in this room may not be paying their taxes "			2
we were shocked - he spoke to us like utter dirt			0
' the fact is my father was n’t being monitored or anything because staff were n’t updating his notes properly			0
it was heart - breaking to see my dad suffer like that			0
we had our trust in the professionals , only for them to fail			0
' the @entity4 keep promising they will get things right , but they ’re not			2
when mistakes are made in hospital , people ’s lives are at risk			0
' the cash strapped hospital is at the centre of an investigation after it emerged it had ' lost ' £ 3.8m in accounting bungles			0
this week the hospital ’s director of finance resigned			0
sores : mr @entity8 died following treatment at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , where he had developed pressure sores due to being bedbound and was said to look like a ' shadow of his former self ' @entity198 , director of patient experience and safety / chief nurse at @entity15 said : ' i fully accept that there was inadequate communication with mr @entity8 and his family during his father ’s time in our care last year and unacceptable delays in sending him reports into his subsequent complaints			1
' some patients have complex health conditions which mean they are particularly at risk of developing pressure sores			1
' we use risk assessments , provide special pressure relieving mattresses and cushions and where needed turn patients frequently to minimise these risks			0
' however , in some patients it can be very difficult to minimise all these risks and prevent pressure sores occurring			1
' in the case of mr @entity8 ’s father we believe that overall appropriate care was given however the documentation to give evidence of what had been done was sometimes lacking			1
