by @entity0 published : 20:16 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 04:23 est , 26 march 2013 @entity2 drama : @entity3 pictured as @entity4 in scene from the eponymous 1960 film directed by @entity7 for some , @entity8 is an opportunity for @entity10 reflection			0
for others it is simply a time to indulge in a chocolate egg or two			0
but @entity14 looks forward to the @entity15 weekend for a very different reason … the number of epic films traditionally broadcast on television			1
the film critic has drawn up a list of the top ten epic movies , including modern hits such as @entity24 alongside classics such as @entity26 and @entity27			1
he told the @entity28 has traditionally been ‘ a time when tv networks dusted down their epic movies for our edification – biblical epics of course – to remind us that @entity8 is about rather more than chocolate eggs and the @entity37 ’			1
big budget epics , portraying life on a grand scale , required huge sets and casts in @entity44 ’s golden era but now these elements are more often than not replaced by computer generated images			0
mr @entity14 , 79 , who presented @entity50 ’s @entity49 programme between 1972 and 1998 , said he had no problem with the use of such effects to achieve a sense of awe and scale			2
he said : ‘ an argument is currently raging about whether a film can truly be regarded as an epic if it relies heavily on @entity60 , as all recent films claiming to be epics do			1
‘ the purists say no. the use of computers to create crowds and exciting effects , they seem to suggest , is cheating			0
i think the purists should get a life			0
gladiator was ranked alongside two other @entity92 epics , @entity26 , from 1959 , and @entity4 , made the following year			2
he says of @entity26 : ‘ i doubt whether even a computer could have produced a more exciting and realistic chariot race than the one in @entity26			2
’ of @entity4 , he says : ‘ still one of the best examples of the genre			0
’ historical tale : @entity98 and @entity99 starring in the film @entity101 in 1962 describing @entity101 , made in 1962 and starring @entity99 , he says : ‘ practically every superlative you can think of has been applied to @entity104 ’s epic … and it deserves them all			1
’ apocalypse now , released in 1979 , he calls self - indulgent but magnificent and @entity27 , from 1939 , he describes as : ‘ the greatest unresolved love affair in cinema			0
’ mr @entity14 said : ‘ the main ingredient of an epic movie is size			2
it has to tell an extraordinary tale – whether @entity113 , historical or totally fictional – on a grand scale			1
‘ and ideally at the heart of it , never mind the momentous events going on , there should be an intimate story			0
’ both @entity101 and @entity26 are among the epics being screened this @entity8 weekend .			1
