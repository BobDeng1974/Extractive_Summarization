all her life , the elderly worshipper had been inspired by her church ’s fresco of @entity4 with his crown of thorns			2
so when the plaster portrait began to crumble owing to damp , the woman in her 80s decided not to stand idly by			1
without consulting the authorities at the @entity10 in @entity11 , southern @entity12 , she marched in with oil paint and brush , and started work on her own private restoration project			1
' restored ' : the image bears more resemblance to a character from @entity20 than to @entity4 after a woman in her 80 's ' repaired ' it without permission original : @entity25 's ' @entity24 ' , which has been admired by worshippers at the @entity10 in @entity27 , @entity12 , for more than 120 years damaged : moisture in the church caused the surface of the fresco , which has huge sentimental value , to deteriorate quite what she thinks of her handiwork has not been disclosed			1
but her fellow worshippers are horrified			0
the 120 - year - old fresco , @entity24 by @entity38 , has been transformed into something which looks more like a movie werewolf			0
to add to the general embarrassment , a local catholic cultural foundation , the @entity41 for @entity42 , had received a donation from the granddaughter of the artist which it was about to spend on returning the fresco to its former glory			1
as a team of experts examined the woman ’s handiwork to see if it can be reversed , a spokesman for the centre said : ‘ the value of the original work was not very high but it was more of a sentimental value			2
‘ the lady , who is in her 80s , apparently considers herself to be an artist			2
she acted without authorisation from anyone			0
‘ the church is always open because many people visit and although there is a guard , no one realised what she was doing until she had finished			0
’ video : @entity24 insists she did n't act on her own but with permission ...			0
