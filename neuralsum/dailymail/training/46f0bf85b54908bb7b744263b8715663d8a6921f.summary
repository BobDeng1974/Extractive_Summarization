were @entity0 right to part with boss @entity2 ? in the end , @entity2 's showdown with @entity0 chairman @entity4 and director of football administration @entity5 went just as they had predicted			1
the manager went out swinging			2
@entity2 had known since a meeting with @entity4 on april 7 that he was a dead man walking and he did not hold back in a full and frank exchange of opinions during tuesday ’s early - morning meeting at the training ground			1
@entity4 retaliated and it is his belief that every time @entity2 talked during his seven - month spell in charge at @entity0 , he slit his own throat			1
on tuesday , @entity4 and @entity5 finished him off			1
often they were spell - binding to listen to , a refreshing change of pace amid the guff often trotted out by managers in the @entity47			2
but @entity2 went too far			1
the former @entity0 midfielder was told on tuesday his behaviour was not becoming of a manager at a club with @entity0 ’s traditions and history			1
@entity2 maintained he was just being honest			1
@entity4 , though , believed it was only a matter of time before @entity2 broke the golden rule at @entity57 by bad - mouthing him or owner @entity58 in public			1
cross them and you are fired : just ask @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			2
this is one of the most prestigious jobs in football , but the consequences of falling out of line are always brutal			2
this was his chance to prove he could stand alongside men of stature such as @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			2
instead , he talked himself out of the job			2
it ’s a long road back			0
after @entity0 ’s 4 - 0 defeat at @entity82 on march 8 , when the team had been reduced to 10 men , @entity2 claimed : ‘ i know the players i can trust and those i ca n’t			1
then , after the 4 - 0 defeat at @entity89 on march 30 , @entity4 almost had to call in the @entity90 after @entity2 clashed with former @entity0 boss @entity91			1
opinionated : @entity2 's outspoken nature in interviews and press conferences helped cost him his job at @entity57 targets ? @entity100 boss @entity99 ( left ) and @entity102 manager @entity101 are being linked with the job in december , @entity4 had afforded @entity91 , sacked by @entity0 in 2003 following a calamitous run of results , the courtesy of an interview for the manager ’s job			1
he was never going to be appointed			0
@entity2 , aware of this , reacted badly when @entity91 , who is a regular visitor to the @entity0 boardroom on matchdays , criticised his players for their approach at @entity114			1
@entity91 ’s observations about them leaning against the wall outside the dressing room before kick - off were correct			0
‘ @entity91 ’s got a lot of opinion and he ’s also got a lot of opinion about @entity0 , and he ’s entitled to that , ’ claimed @entity2			1
‘ it ’s been a long time since @entity91 ’s managed a football team and the game has moved on significantly			2
’ back in @entity91 ’s day , when he attempted to freeze @entity128 out of the first team , the midfielder ambushed a board meeting over it			2
he has always been strong - willed			0
nothing changed after @entity4 agreed to make him the manager on an 18 - month contract following the dismissal of @entity65			1
with a few decent results behind him against teams outside the top four , he maintained the club did not need to recruit players in january			0
@entity4 was happy with this			1
then , after @entity0 lost 1 - 0 to @entity142 at @entity57 — their third defeat by @entity76 ’s side this season — @entity2 insisted he could ‘ only play the hand i ’ve been dealt ’			1
mediocre : @entity0 finished sixth in the @entity47 after @entity146 won 14 of his 28 games in charge honest : @entity2 believes @entity0 would 've challenged for the top four had they not sold @entity149 to @entity150 last summer 28 games as @entity0 manager ( 14 wins , four draws , 10 losses ) 1 gilet worn 47 goals scored during his reign at @entity0 42 @entity47 points earned ( 13 wins , three draws and six losses ) 2 @entity47 debuts from @entity0 academy players ( @entity163 , 21 , and @entity164 , 18 ) 47 goals condceded 1 win in a cup competition ( 3 - 1 ) v @entity166 , february 27 141 days in charge by then , @entity4 was keeping a low profile after conceding that he and director of football @entity169 had brought in too many players last summer			1
they were too hasty to rebuild after @entity149 ’s move to @entity150			0
still , @entity2 had his own aggressive transfer plans in place for the summer as he prepared for his first full season			1
there were proposals to bring in @entity180 defender @entity179 , @entity182 midfielder @entity181 and striker @entity183 from @entity82			1
@entity2 was convinced he could sign all three			2
he believed they would make the team competitive but @entity4 told @entity2 at their april 7 meeting that he was preparing to make yet another change			1
‘ you know i like experience , ’ @entity4 told him			2
sixth : @entity2 's last game was a 3 - 0 win over @entity31 , which secured @entity193 football on tuesday the chairman added : ‘ since appointing @entity2 as assistant first - team coach in 2008 and then as technical co-ordinator in 2010 and head of football development in 2012 , we have been supportive of him during management changes			1
i should like to state our thanks for all his efforts during his years with us			0
we wish him great success in his managerial career			0
‘ now the season is over , we shall embark on the process of finding a new head coach			0
we have a talented squad and exciting players coming through			0
we need to build on this season , develop our potential and inspire the kind of performances we associate with our great club			0
’ as for @entity2 , he is disappointed but determined to return as a @entity47 manager			1
march 8 ( following a 4 - 0 defeat at @entity82 ) there ’s a lack of characters			0
too many of them are too nice to each other			0
we need to show a bit more guts and not want to be someone ’s mate all the time			0
@entity226 12 ( reflecting on his comments at @entity82 ) they are all men , they all appreciate that i am singing it from the heart , not from the script			0
i ’m not an actor , i work on impulse			0
i ’m just going to shoot from the hip			0
i ’m a manager , not a babysitter			2
april 17 ( on @entity149 ’s move to @entity150 ) give me @entity149 and i think we might have been realistic challengers for the top four			0
his fee looks cheap now			0
may 9 ( summing up his feelings two days before the final game against @entity31 ) if you have a supply teacher who comes into your school , sometimes they ’re not treated with the respect that a headmaster is			0
if i need information on my future i ’m better off asking the players			0
i ’m not sure if the chairman has spoken to @entity255 but obviously someone has told him			2
i have had a lot of players come to me and say their agents have told them that i ’m not going to be here next year			0
it is a very difficult situation but i have got to get on with it .			0
