a large house spider might seem like a thoughtless killing machine , but a team of biologists claim arachnids have distinct personalities			2
while some individuals might be aggressive , other arachnids could be naturally ' timid ' and docile ' , the researchers said			2
they studied social grass spiders and found that a spider 's personality not only determines the creature 's survival , but contributes to the success of failure of its society			1
scientists studied social grass spiders ( like this one in a tunnel web ) and found that a spider 's personality not only determines the creature 's well - being , but contributes to the success of failure of its society researchers from the @entity24 , led by @entity25 , found the spiders could be timid or aggressive and prone to sexual cannibalism			1
while most spiders live solitary lives and territorial of their webs , a handful of species live in social groups where females share the upkeep of the web as well as jobs like raising their young and defending their home from intruders			0
the study , which took six years and was published in journal @entity41 , in july , examined sociable grass spiders			0
the researchers categorised the spiders into two groups - aggressive or docile - to investigate how the mixture of personalities serves the community 's well - being			1
they established three different spider colonies in @entity52 , beginning with a pair of docile spiders , a pair of aggressive spiders and a mixed pair			1
while some spiders might be aggressive , other arachnids could be naturally ' timid ' and docile , ' scientists said - which might go some way to helping some people become less afraid of the creatures			1
the researchers believe spiders have personalities leaving each colonies to go forth and multiplying the wild , the scientists checked on the creatures ' progress every summer for six years			0
while the docile colony seemed to be thriving at first - reproducing faster than the others and spreading colonies nearby - their webs were invaded by more aggressive species that stole their food and eggs as well as eating the passive hosts			1
at the end of the six year term , the colonies descended from the docile pair were extinct , while the colonies started by aggressive pairs and a mixture of the two personalities survived , even if their colonies got off to a slower start as they reproduced more slowly			1
the biologists found that the animals ' personalities did n't matter if there was no common enemy as when there were no invading species , all the colonies thrived			2
while the docile colony of grass spiders ( like the one pictured ) seemed to be thriving at first - reproducing faster than the others and spreading colonies nearby - their webs were invaded by more aggressive species that stole their food and eggs as well as eating the passive hosts dr @entity25 said the aggressive spiders acted like the colony 's immune system			1
he told the @entity108 : ' they keep this social disease , these parasites , at a low abundance			0
' they also found that while bold spiders were often aggressive there was no link to their body size and larger spiders could be docile			2
' hence , we show that personalities shape task differentiation in a social spider independent of age , ' the write in the study			0
the researchers have now turned their attention to other species and are looking at sexual cannibalism in grass spiders as well as social spiders in @entity129 and @entity130			0
they are also examining the personalities of tiny slave - making ants that enslave other ant species inside acorns and force them to find their food and raise their young			0
dr @entity25 said : ' sometimes they 'll have a revolt and kill the slavemakers , but it 's pretty infrequent			0
i bet you it has something to do with their personality types			0

@entity150 researchers found a spider 's personality not only determines the creature 's well - being , but contributes to the success of failure of its society
*university* of @entity161 biologists established three colonies in @entity52 with docile and aggressive couples of spiders
the docile colony thrived at once but *lacked* aggressive spiders to defend it , acting like an immune system and died out before the end of the study
