young love can be an awkward and embarrassing affair so one teenager picked a novel way to woo the object of his affections - he decided to record a cover version of a classic love song			1
@entity9 chose to perform @entity11 ' @entity10 , for his friend @entity12			1
he then posted the video online and , predictably , it has gone viral			0
it 's clear that @entity9 has closely studied the @entity11 original as , just like the singer 's video , @entity9 performs against a forest background			1
but unlike @entity11 who is wearing a blue denim jacket , @entity9 dons a @entity37 shirt , beige cargo shorts and white trainers			2
as he warbles along to the lyrics , the next shot moves to @entity9 perching on a green bike as he sings longingly into the camera			2
best shot : as he warbles along to the lyrics , the next shot moves to @entity9 perching on a green bike as he sings longingly into the camera in one scene he leans against a tree and plays an electric guitar , bobbing his head emphatically to the music			2
the video ends with a rolling message on a black screen which reads : ' special thanks to @entity12 for being beautiful , @entity11 for writing the song , @entity58 for being camera man			1
' once again @entity12 , you are beautiful and you are the best thing that 's ever happened to me			2
' the video ends with a rolling message on a black screen which reads : ' special thanks to @entity12 for being beautiful , @entity11 for writing the song , @entity58 for being camera man ' @entity9 makes clear the depth of his adoration for @entity12 but just when it looks like the love - sick tribute is over , @entity9 appears on the screen again			1
' hi @entity12 , i bet you probably think i am a creep after i gave you the music video and the song and everything , ' he says			1
' but all i can really do is tell you that i care about you more than words can express and that is why i had to make the video			1
last word : just when it looks the love - sick tribute is over , @entity9 appears on the screen again against a backdrop of foliage with his hands in his pocket and speaks to the object of his affection down the lenses of the camera ' i mean you can hate me , do whatever you want as long as you know how much i care			1
how much pain i go through to come up with ideas , just to describe it			0
' you 're pretty much all i care about , even just to tell you about this i am making myself feel insane talking to a camera but i hope you like the video			2
' then he adds : ' enjoy it			0
i enjoyed making it for you			0
' the video has already been seen by over 200,000 people and has had over 3,000 likes			0
under the clip , which was posted on @entity106 , the text reads : ' alright , here is the deal , i made this music video for @entity12 , who you know i love if you watch my vlog			1
' this is the full version , every clip is in it			0
' i know it sucks , i ca n't sing very well			0
i gave @entity12 a copy of this before posting it , she liked it , and that is the point			0
i hope you like it if you view it , i put a lot of work in			0
credit was given where credit was due			0
