by @entity0 published : 07:01 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 10 june 2013 powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity3 has been found by one of @entity6 ’s aging rover vehicles			1
evidence of water of @entity3 has been indicated by a succession of discoveries on @entity3 but until now they have all suggested flows of sulphuric acid			1
this is the first time water has been found in a form that is likely to be drinkable			2
the discovery boosts the chances that one of life ’s most important building blocks was once present on the planet , and might even still be there			2
opportunity found traces of a clay mineral on @entity3 thought to have been formed by a reaction with water			1
@entity29 is a metre - square area on a crater rim and the spot marked @entity33 in this false colour image is where the sample was taken			2
it was hailed by a leading @entity6 scientist as one of the most important yet made by the @entity24 , which is approaching the tenth anniversary of its launch			1
the find that has so excited the team behind the @entity24 mission is chemical analysis of a small rock which included a clay mineral , montmorillonite , that is likely to have been formed by water with a neutral ph. ‘ this is powerful evidence the water interacted with this rock and changed its chemistry , ’ said professor @entity51 , of @entity6 ’s @entity52 and @entity53			1
‘ clay minerals only tend to form at a more neutral ph. this is water you could drink			1
this is water that was much more favourable for things like pre-biotic chemistry - the kind of chemistry that could lead to the origin of life			2
@entity70 exists on @entity71 where it is known to be formed from a reaction with igneous rocks			1
the rock that was analysed by @entity24 by its alpha particle x-ray spectrometer and microscopic imager once the rock abrasion tool had obtained a clean sample inside a square meter test area called @entity29 within a region known as @entity82 on the rim of a 14 - mile wide crater , @entity85			2
opportunity has travelled 22.5 miles since landing on @entity3 in january 2004 on what was expected to be a three - month mission			1
it started its explorations at @entity91 , just 72 - feet across , and worked its way up to the 14 - mile wide @entity85 crater			2
signals beamed back to earth revealed to waiting scientists that it was a rock like no other yet tested by @entity24			0
‘ we ’ve been discovering evidence of water on @entity3 since we landed in 2004 , ’ said professor @entity51			1
‘ the vast majority of them point to water that was at a very low ph – it was acid			1
we run around talking ‘ water on @entity3 , water on @entity3 ’			1
in fact , what opportunity has mostly found evidence for is sulphuric acid on @entity3			1
‘ what we have here has a very different chemistry			0
clay minerals like montmorillonite only tend to form at a more neutral ph. the rock , @entity29 , that showed signs of drinking water once being on @entity3 , was within an area known as @entity82			1
the rover reached the area in august 2011 and explored it for more than 20 months , leaving in may this year			0
the while line shows the route			0
' this is the most powerful evidence for neutral chemisty water that has been found by @entity24			1
’ he added : ‘ to me right now i would say what we have found with @entity29 has sort of vaulted into my personal top five for the whole nine - and - a - half year mission			0
this is a good one			0
' @entity29 was so important , we committed several weeks to getting this one measurement of it , even though we knew the clock was ticking			0
‘ what 's so special about @entity29 is that there was enough water not only for reactions that produced clay minerals , but also enough to flush out ions set loose by those reactions , so that opportunity can clearly see the alteration			1
’ a digitally enhanced image providing a @entity151 view of the route opportunity has taken since leaving the @entity29 rock			0
it took 20 @entity3 days to get from the rock to the spot shown as ' @entity157 ' where it was on june 3			1
@entity159 1 was the day opportunity landed on @entity3			1
scientists are confident the spectrometer has revealed signs of water with a neutral ph because of the high proportion of aluminium detected by the spectrometer compared to other chemicals including iron , magnesium and calcium			1
the rover has now been instructed by its controllers to head towards @entity176 , another part of the rim of @entity85 , having spent two years exploring @entity82			0
the opportunity rover is now on its way to @entity176 , just over a mile away , to investigate more geological features			0
this false colour image highlights some of the ancient rock formations that it will have to negotiate			0
opportunity was launched on july 7 , 2003 and landed on january 25 , 2004 for what was originally expected to be a three - month mission			0
opportunity travelled 283 million miles to reach @entity3 after its launch in 2003			2
its sister rover , @entity189 , reached the planet three weeks earlier			0
@entity6 lost touch with @entity189 in march 2010 after it got stuck in soft ground			2
opportunity was the first to find evidence of water on the planet , within three months of starting operations			2
it has travelled more than 36km and its motor has made 70 million revolutions , seven time more than were guaranteed by the manufacturer			0
its performance , however , exceeded all expectations and while the rover is today described as ‘ arthritic ’ , with a ‘ gimpy shoulder ’ and a memory that is showing the first signs of failing , it is still operational and making amazing findings			0
@entity211 , the project manager for the @entity3 rover expeditions , said opportunity is in ‘ remarkably good health ’ but added : ‘ we ’ve been on borrowed time for a while			2
’ one of the rover ’s flash memories is showing signs of ‘ amnesia ’ he said but while it is proving an ‘ occasional annoyance ’ it is not yet a serious threat to the mission			0
he emphasised that the rover is operating in a ‘ very hostile environment ’ with extreme temperature fluctuation			0
‘ the @entity229 could have a catastrophic failure at any moment , ’ he added			0
‘ every day is a gift			0

clay mineral formed in a reaction with water is detected by spectrometer
*previous* evidence has pointed to water on @entity3 being extremely acidic
