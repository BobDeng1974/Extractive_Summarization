a church will hold its maundy thursday service today instead of tomorrow to allow a weekly drop - in session for prostitutes to go ahead			1
@entity4 in @entity5 re-scheduled the service , which marks the start of @entity9 celebrations , so that vulnerable women can attend their regular thursday sessions tomorrow			1
the decision comes after prostitutes were left disappointed when the drop - in sessions were cancelled on @entity15 and @entity16 because they both fell on a thursday			1
outreach : @entity4 in @entity5 , pictured , re-scheduled the service , which marks the start of @entity9 celebrations , so that vulnerable women can attend their regular thursday sessions tomorrow religious leaders have praised the initiative , which has been running since last august , as reflecting the core values of @entity22			1
@entity4 , which is in the middle of @entity5 's red light district , is the only place where prostitutes can receive the support offered by the sessions , reverend @entity23 said			1
the programme is run alongside national charities changing lives and the @entity33			2
service : @entity4 is the only place where prostitutes can receive the support offered by the sessions , reverend @entity23 , pictured , said @entity37 , team vicar at @entity4 , said : ' we throw open our doors and offer support as well as going out on the streets with hot drinks to invite women in			1
' we want to be a reliable , safe and loving place for women , it is important to honour our promise and it has had a real impact on the whole church here			2
' there is conversation , there is advice if any woman wants advice about employment or health or other issues			0
' it is well received and it is appreciated			0
@entity15 and @entity61 were on thursday and we know we had disappointed people by cancelling the session for services			1
' we had to take a vote in the congregation in january and it was 100 per cent in favour of moving the service			2
' the story of @entity71 is @entity73 meeting with a number of people and he meets with women who are outcasts			1
' one of the stories we tell on @entity71 is about @entity73 being anointed by a woman of low status and it felt wrong to cancel it			2
' the @entity84 , reverend @entity85 , said the decision to move the religious event forward was made by the church council and people should go elsewhere for a traditional thursday service			1
he said : ' this decision was n't taken lightly and there are other churches very close by where people can go to worship			0
it does n't come across as strange to me that @entity4 would do this			2
' i am very well aware of this project for street workers , it has been a great success in the last six months			0
' it performs a very important service for vulnerable women and is exactly what @entity22 churches should be doing to help their community			1
' reverend @entity109 of @entity110 in @entity111 , added : ' it is a long - standing tradition to have a @entity114 thursday ceremony and an important part of the @entity22 calendar			1
' on the other hand , if we remember what @entity73 was all about , he would always remember the outcasts in society			0
' for some of these drop - in sessions it can be quite hard to let people know what is going on if there is a change			0
' so if people turn up to see it is n't on one week , they may not come again			0
' custom : the @entity133 hands out @entity114 money during last year 's @entity71 service in @entity136 @entity71 , also known as @entity137 , is the beginning of the three - day celebration of @entity9			1
the original version of the @entity140 involved the sovereign giving money to the poor and washing their feet , a tradition which ended with @entity145 in the 18th century			0
the custom of washing feet is an an ancient one and commemorates the last supper of @entity73 with the @entity150 , echoing the story of @entity73 washing the extremities of his disciples shortly before his death			0
although foot washing is no longer part of the ceremony , the tradition of giving ' alms ' continues , albeit symbolically			0
the @entity114 gift , which the @entity133 hands to members of the congregation at a church service , is made up of two purses , one red and one white			2
many @entity167 commemorate the @entity168 in a special @entity169			0
in some churches , they may wash each other 's feet			0
some @entity167 may hold an all night vigil in church , remembering @entity73 's time in the @entity176 .			0
