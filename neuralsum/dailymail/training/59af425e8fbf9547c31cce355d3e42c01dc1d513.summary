cut off by the @entity2 , 340,000 @entity1 troops were evacuated from northern @entity3 during the ' @entity4 ' in 1940			1
but somehow , @entity5 got left behind			2
undaunted , the 20 - year - old soldier stole a car and managed to evade the @entity8 , eventually finding a skipper six days later to sail him home			1
four years on , he was back - storming the beaches of @entity11 as part of @entity13 - and lived to tell the tale			1
now aged 93 , he has finally been awarded his campaign medals - almost 68 years after peace was declared			2
reluctant hero : @entity5 , 93 , pictured with his medals at home in @entity20 , @entity21 - he did n't collect the medals for 68 years , but says he is proud to have them now despite his heroism , mr may prefers not to dwell on his wartime experiences - and it was not until a neighbour in his home town of @entity20 in @entity21 asked to see his war medals that he felt the absence of them			1
as a young man after the war ended , he had never bothered to claim them			2
after discovering this , the neighbour began the process of applying for them on mr may 's behalf			0
the six campaign medals due to him were the 1939 - 45 star , the @entity44 , the @entity45 , the @entity3 and @entity8 star , the @entity47 and the @entity4 medal			1
now that he has received them , mr may said he is proud to have the reminder of his loyal service in - and lucky escape from - two such seminal historic events of the last century			0
' i was just 20 years old in 1940 - i was n't interested in medals but i 'm proud now that i have got them , ' he revealed			1
' mr may said that he left @entity57 and joined the @entity58 in 1940 as a driver with the @entity60			0
he was stationed in @entity3 and was meant to evacuate with other @entity1 soldiers from the beaches and harbours of @entity4 as part of ' @entity4 ' , intended to rescue the @entity66 , @entity3 and @entity67 soldiers who had been cut off by the encroaching @entity8 invaders			1
honoured : mr may 's medals including the 1939 - 45 star , the @entity3 and @entity8 star , the @entity44 , the @entity45 , the @entity72 and the @entity4 medal brave troops : vessels for the invasion of @entity11 , seen from deck of the @entity78 but while nearly 340,000 troops were rescued by a band of 850 ships - many of which were privately owned and included motor yachts and fishing boats - may was not one of them			1
left behind , the soldier went on the run across @entity89 - occupied @entity3 in a stolen car with six of his army comrades			1
six days later the group found a skipper who agreed to sail them back home			0
on the way they were still under threat , and were shadowed by a @entity8 u-boat before they finally came ashore on the @entity102 coast			0
after two years serving in @entity104 , he returned to @entity3 for the @entity13 in june 1944 - also known as @entity13 , the invasion began on d - day , 6 june 1944 , and ended on 30 june 1944			1
the landings were undertaken in two phases - an airborne assault landing of 24,000 troops shortly after midnight , and an amphibious infantry landing on the coast of @entity3 starting at 6.30am			1
in total , more than 160,000 soldiers attacked along a 50 - mile stretch of coast			0
@entity11 : the landings were undertaken in two phases , an airborne assault landing of 24,000 troops shortly after midnight , and an amphibious infantry landing on the coast of @entity3 starting at 6:30 am the @entity119 swiftly established a firm foothold in @entity11 , and mr may was part of one of the great turning points for @entity1 fortunes in @entity125			1
his role was as a driver of one of the @entity130 amphibious landing vehicle known as ' ducks '			0
' it was just luck i suppose , surviving the war , ' said mr may			0
' i was a duck driver on @entity13 and when they fired the big gun on the back the thing nearly went over			0
' he remained in the @entity140 until 1946			0
after being demobbed mr may began working in sales , married his wife @entity142 , and retired to @entity21 with her more than 30 years ago			0
@entity143 : ' he is part of that generation who are not likely to start jumping around the room over a shiny bit of metal , but i could see what it meant to him , ' said mr may 's neighbour next - door - neighbour @entity153 helped @entity24 may obtain his six campaign medals after a chat revealed that mr may had nothing to show for his time in the @entity159			2
' i used to chat to him about the war - he has been through quite a lot but does n't really want to talk about it , ' said mr @entity153 , a flying instructor at @entity163			0
' it is amazing that he was at d - day and @entity4 - not many can say that , as i would imagine the odds of surviving both are pretty slim			2
' but mr @entity153 said that his neighbour was not one for fuss , and preferred to be stalwart about the medals			0
' he is part of that generation who are not likely to start jumping around the room over a shiny bit of metal , but i could see what it meant to him			0
' hailed by @entity179 as a ' miracle of deliverance ' , the evacuation of @entity1 soldiers from the beaches and harbour of @entity4 is one of the best - known episodes of the @entity125			2
after @entity66 , @entity3 and @entity67 troops became cut off by the advancing @entity8 army , some 850 ships sailed to @entity3 to rescue them			1
they included the ' famous little ships of @entity4 ' , a flotilla of about 700 merchant marine boats , fishing boats , pleasure craft and lifeboats			2
between may 27 and june 4 , 1940 , around 340,000 soldiers were rescued , including almost 200,000 @entity66 troops			1
the mission , codenamed @entity4 , incurred significant losses , however , and @entity179 warned afterwards : ' wars are not won by evacuations '			0
the @entity66 premier said there was not doubt in his mind that the @entity1 operations in @entity206 prior to the evacuation had been a ' colossal military disaster '			0
nine @entity1 destroyers - six @entity66 and three @entity3 - were sunk during @entity4 , and more than 100 @entity211 aircraft were lost in the fighting .			1

@entity5 , then 20 , missed last boat home in 1940 as the @entity66 retreated from @entity3 harbour after being cut off by @entity8
