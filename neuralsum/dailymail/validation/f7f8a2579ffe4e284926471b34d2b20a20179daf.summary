the key to a happy home is regular meals together , more than one tablet computer and a @entity5 account , a new study has revealed			1
research into the lives of 2,000 @entity10 families found that traditional values such as regular heart - to - hearts , hugs and knowing when to say sorry were still important factors for domestic bliss			1
but the study also revealed that modern families believed that having modern technology and gadgets such as a @entity5 account , fast wi - fi and @entity21 were also key to harmonious home life			1
a new study has found that one of the keys to domestic bliss is having more than one tablet computer per household ( picture posed by models ) monthly trips to the cinema , a good coffee machine for mum and dad and at least three televisions were also deemed necessities for happiness			2
the research , commissioned by @entity10 manufacturer @entity39 , found the highest rated tips for domestic bliss included eating together regularly , laughing a lot and keeping the home tidy			1
despite the importance of eating together proving the most popular source for a happy family , a third said they rarely find time to do this			1
a quarter of families also felt they have n't got a good work / life balance with the average family getting less than 12 hours a week together			1
@entity54 , managing director at @entity39 , said : ' the list of things that people attribute to happiness at home is an interesting mix of traditional processes , efforts to create a warm environment blended with the presence of technology and modern comforts			1
the whole family regularly eating together topped the list of things that helped create a harmonious family life ' it 's nice to see that eating together is still seen as the biggest sign of family bonding and a significant part of what people say makes a happy home			1
' modern life can be so hectic that families can struggle to get time together or ensure they appreciate their home life fully			1
people and their lifestyles change over time and homes need to be able to change with them			2
' whether it 's through physical changes like extending or developing the property , or through making a conscious effort to do things together more , building that home environment clearly leads to happiness			1
after all , an @entity92 's home is his castle			1
' the study also revealed that keeping the place tidy , cooking with the children and having in - jokes makes all the difference in fuelling a great home environment			1
unsurprisingly , a dishwasher helped to avoid arguments about who is going to do the washing up , while a @entity5 account was seen as an important factor in keeping the peace despite items such as fast wi - fi , @entity21 and everyone having their own smartphone or tablet , old fashioned bonding such as hugs and eating together were in the top five ways to keep a happy home while a lock on the bathroom door , movie nights and well - lit rooms were also important factors to a house being free of doom and gloom			1
a good stack of board games , a comfortable sofa everyone can pile on and picking up clothes from the floor also goes a long way			2
narrowly missing out on the top 50 elements for family happiness was the ability to share the remote control , having blinds to keep out nosy neighbours and a set of bi-fold doors opening out to the garden also help			1
more than two thirds of the families studied also felt that they were in definite need of more space at home			1
but children had other ideas when it came to essentials for a happy home with a tree house the most wished - for item , followed by a swimming pool in the garden and a bigger playroom			1
@entity54 added : ' space plays such a big part in creating a happy home environment			1
' lack of adequate space for a household has also been shown to have significant impact on health , educational attainment and family relationships			2
