an unedifying end to @entity1 provided @entity2 with a simple lesson			1
defend even remotely as poorly as this and their @entity6 campaign will end at the last - 32 stage			2
@entity8 had hoped to see positive signs for the future from this pressure - free dead rubber played amid a ghostly ambience			2
instead , the lifeless way the @entity14 side went about combating @entity17 ’s attacking threats provided cause for much head - scratching concern			2
the @entity21 are hardly a continental force			1
whichever side comes out of the hat in monday ’s draw for the first knockout round will possess significantly superior quality			1
but @entity8 ’s men allowed them to every opportunity to impress — with full - back @entity31 having a particularly lamentable evening — and that hospitality was warmly accepted			2
@entity34 claimed a hat - trick for the hosts , while @entity37 also found a way past @entity39			1
it should be noted that , once again , the goalkeeper was @entity2 ’s best player in a @entity43 outing , notching a clutch of worthy saves to prevent the scoreline swelling further			1

there were times when @entity17 entered into a pact of non-defending			0
@entity116 and @entity93 were on target as @entity2 briefly led during the first half			1
an own goal from @entity69 then gave the @entity122 champions hope of avoiding a fifth @entity43 defeat of the season but it ultimately went unfulfilled			1
yes , there were changes to @entity8 ’s line - up with only prize money and co-efficient points at stake			0
but they were all in more advanced areas			0
those at the back will have to do better – much , much better – if @entity2 are to keep an edge of glamour to their campaign come the spring			1
having also conceded three to @entity63 in their previous @entity6 outing , @entity8 may now view defensive reinforcement as a rising priority come the january window			1
maybe it was case of playing down to the surroundings , given that the @entity145 provided swathes of empty blue seats as a backdrop			0
the dismal attendance was n’t solely down to the inconsequential nature of proceedings , as @entity17 ’s hardcore fans have been calling for a boycott in protest at the direction their club has taken			0
a haul of three points from their opening five @entity1 games also led to a demand for a public apology from the players			0
it has not been a happy camp			0
more than 1,000 @entity2 fans had made the trek to @entity21 , presumably having booked up in anticipation of this being a decisive contest			1
they at least added a little pocket of noise to an otherwise eerie atmosphere , although the sight of a flare being lit at kick - off was unwelcome given the club ’s previous brushes with @entity178			0
a fringe of mist hung over the stadium as the temperature dipped towards zero			0
it was cold enough to make one think fondly about a january fixture in @entity185			0
@entity2 supporters wave flags and spark flares ahead of the match at the @entity145 in @entity190 @entity2 manager @entity8 fielded a relatively strong side despite his side already qualifying from @entity1 @entity34 gives the hosts the lead after reacting to a loose ball to slot past @entity2 keeper @entity39 the @entity17 teenager ( left ) is followed by team - mates as he races away after opening the scoring for the hosts despite appearing offside , @entity2 striker @entity116 ( left ) nods in a fortunate header to bring the @entity122 level commons celebrates after bringing @entity2 level in the first half , although his goal may not be enough to keep him at the club @entity93 ( left ) scores only minutes later to give the @entity122 champions the lead in the first half @entity212 races to the tv cameras to reveal a message on his t - shirt after scoring in the first half @entity34 ( left ) scores his second goal of the night after more woeful defending by the @entity122 champions the @entity49 forward celebrates after sending both sides in level at the interval @entity8 ’s selection contained some of the anticipated alterations – with @entity93 and @entity90 introduced – but the back four from saturday ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity225 was retained in the hope of providing a stable base			1
it did n’t quite work out			0
@entity17 had threatened early on when @entity69 cut the ball back for skipper @entity230 , whose low shot was thwarted by an @entity83 block			1
@entity233 was then offside as he found the net , but a home breakthrough duly arrived after 14 minutes			0
the @entity21 pressed around the penalty area , with @entity71 eventually miscuing a shot that fell perfectly for @entity34			1
he cut on to his right foot , leaving @entity31 spinning in his wake , before placing a calm finish beyond @entity39 and inside the far post			0
@entity2 could point to a degree of misfortune but @entity31 was skinned all too easily			1
@entity17 ’s defence had been disrupted after 11 minutes when @entity245 sustained a head knock and had to be replaced by @entity247			0
and their revised line - up was undone in a rather strange fashion as @entity8 ’s men dragged themselves level in the 24th minute			1
the ball spun high into the air after @entity254 – captain for the evening after @entity256 was left home to avoid a suspension risk – smacked a free - kick into the defensive wall			0
@entity190 goalkeeper @entity64 was motionless as @entity116 reacted quickest to divert into the net via what looked like a mix of head and shoulder			2
as a concession , it was sponge - soft			0
@entity2 were emboldened by the equaliser and promptly pushed themselves in front six minutes later			2
again , a direct free - kick was key as @entity116 curled a terrific effort against the bar after being toppled just outside the area			1
@entity88 headed back towards goal and @entity93 turned it beyond @entity64			1
the @entity276 striker lifted up his shirt to reveal a ‘ @entity283 my love ’ message as he raced off towards the @entity2 fans in celebration , earning a booking from @entity106 referee @entity105			2
the lead did n’t last long			0
the final act of a first half with all the defensive merits of tissue - paper armour arrived six minutes from the interval			2
an @entity83 challenge inside the area sent the ball to @entity31 , only for the @entity293 to trip over and continue his angst - ridden evening			0
@entity34 accepted the gift with gratitude , beating @entity39 with the aid of a deflection off @entity299			2
whatever was said in the dressing room did n’t cure @entity2 ’s ills			2
in fact , they merely fragmented further			0
@entity39 had to save from @entity70 and @entity34 in quick succession after the restart , yet had no hope of preventing @entity190 from going back in front after 48 minutes			2
@entity230 outpaced @entity31 on @entity2 ’s right flank and pulled the ball back for @entity37 on the 18 - yard line			1
his first - time finish was exquisite , curling fractionally inside the post as @entity39 clutched at air			1
@entity314 pulls off a one handed save on a bad night for @entity2 's defenders @entity37 drills in his effort to give @entity49 a 3 - 2 lead in the second half @entity37 ( centre ) wheels away after giving his side the lead for the first time in the game @entity2 keeper @entity325 ( centre ) complains after @entity34 completes his impressive hat - trick @entity17 's @entity50 was a constant threat down the left flank as he plundered a hat - trick - click here for all the stats from the game with our brilliant @entity332 @entity34 celebrates with team - mates after a performance that is bound to attract interest from @entity178 's big clubs @entity49 defender @entity69 ( left ) scores an own goal under pressure from @entity93 to set up a tense finish a fourth @entity21 goal then followed with indecent haste			1
@entity34 got in front of @entity344 to advance menacingly before crashing a 20 - yard strike into the net and completing his treble			1
it was bleak viewing from a @entity14 perspective			0
@entity31 was put out of his misery as @entity82 became the first substitute introduced by @entity8			0
@entity87 soon followed in place of the ineffective @entity86			0
@entity2 did n’t really stir again until @entity69 reached an @entity85 cross just ahead of @entity93 but succeeded only in finding his own net with nine minutes left			1
@entity87 then saw a dipping effort tipped over by @entity64 before @entity93 was painfully close with a glancing header			2
the damage had , though , already been done at the other end .			0

@entity2 had already qualified for the knockout stages as group runners - up behind @entity63
teenager @entity34 scored a hat - trick with @entity37 also on target for the @entity21 champions
@entity116 and @entity93 netted from set pieces to send the teams in level at half - time
@entity69 set up a tense finish after turning in @entity85 's low cross into his own goal
