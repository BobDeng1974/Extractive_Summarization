@entity0 said monday that it may be time to review a @entity3 program that has placed billions of dollars worth of surplus military gear and equipment in the hands of local police forces since before he became president			1
the @entity3 has been contributing to the militarization of local police forces since at least 2007 , handing over heavy armaments , battle helicopters and armored vehicles for use in urban policing scenarios			1
' i think it 's probably useful for us to review how the funding was done , how local law enforcement has used grant dollars , ' @entity0 told reporters at the @entity23 , ' to make sure that what they 're purchasing is stuff that they actually need			1
' ' there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement , and we do n't want those lines blurred			2
that would be contrary to our tradition , ' he said			0
last week 's armed confrontations between police and protesters in @entity38 , @entity39 , where an officer shot and killed an unarmed 18 - year - old , have ignited a national debate about the militarization of law enforcement agencies			2
' after 9/11 , ' he said , ' i think , understandably , a lot of folks saw local communities that were ill - equipped for a potential catastrophic terrorist attack			0
' ' and then people in @entity52 , and people of good will decided that we 've got to make sure that they get proper equipment to deal with [ it ] ... and some of that 's been useful			0
' but data from the @entity94 of the @entity96 @entity95 show that the @entity3 transferred ownership of at least 239,000 items to civilian law enforcement agencies between 2007 and april of this year			1
while some of the @entity3 's gifts are as mundane as rubber gloves and x-ray machines , others include a fleet of $ 18 million combat helicopters and 345 @entity108 ( mraps ) worth between $ 412,000 and $ 1.08 million apiece			1
mraps were put into service in the @entity96 military to protect personnel from roadside bobs and other improvised explosive devices			2
the @entity115 first obtained the raw data from the @entity3 through a @entity118 request , and completed an analysis of equipment gifted to police forces in @entity122			2
in addition to 17 mraps , law enforcement there received 696 model @entity128 rifles , 32 12 - gauge , ' riot - type shotguns ' and nine grenade launchers since 2006 , according to the paper			0
but the larger picture shows hundreds of helicopters , including some sophisticated armored models , ending up in the control of local governments			2
in 2011 the @entity3 gave @entity139 , @entity140 , a suburban coastal region that includes @entity141 and @entity142 , ownership of eight choppers valued at $ 18 million each			1
data released by the government do n't identify the flying machines by name			0
but a defense analyst told @entity150 that the per - unit cost ' matches the basic profile of an attack helicopter			0
' ' there 's really no civilian observation chopper on the market that costs that much , ' he said			0
most of the helicopters described in the data from the @entity115 are valued at less than $ 1 million each , and are identified as ' observation ' craft			0
standard kit : the @entity72 shooting 's aftermath broughtmilitary arms and vehicles -- not just standard - issue police equipment -- onto the streets of @entity38 military weapons and armor have crossed over from @entity75 bases to police barracks tens of thousands of times in the last seven years , including firearms and anti-ambush vehicles @entity176 , not @entity177 : it 's getting difficult to tell the two apart the @entity179 operates a small fleet of just three choppers			1
there at 16 different incorporated towns and cities in the county , but the @entity3 has n't provided information about which police forces operate those aircraft			2
more than $ 45 million worth of rifles – some 89,000 in all , in three calibers – also left the federal government and landed in the trunks of police cruisers			1
in three @entity96 counties , authorities received 13 @entity198 ' field range ' sniper rifles , worth $ 3,263 each			1
police in @entity200 , @entity201 ; @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 , @entity140 were the lucky recipients of those firearms			0
the latter two are home to the cities of @entity210 and @entity211 , respectively			0
the @entity3 has also donated 9,900 handguns , including more than 400 ' .38 special ' revolvers			1
a total of 98 armored vehicles are also on the list – classified as wheeled ' combat / assault / tactical ' rides			1
perhaps the strangest item migrating from a military base to a police barracks would look more at home in ' @entity222 ' than in ' @entity223			0
' two @entity225 counties got $ 4 million mobile radio broadcast stations designed to flood enemy territory with propaganda messages			1
the ' @entity229 ' ( @entity230 ) radio systems consist of radio and television broadcast stations and antennas mounted on humvees that tow their own generators			2
it 's 21 tons of gear in all , according to the @entity239			0
in @entity241 , according to congressional hearing transcripts , the @entity75 used @entity243 systems to broadcast 10,000 watts of propaganda messages into villages near @entity246 , interspersed with recordings of @entity241 music , sports reports and local news flashes			1
not just in @entity38 : police forces nationwide have requested and been given surplus military hardware to kit their officers out on the job sniper rifle : the @entity3 has transferred weapons like this to civilian police forces in several states necessary ? critics say even tiny towns are receiving battle gear now that the @entity75 has pulled out of @entity241 , this @entity264 ( @entity108 ) armored fighting vehicle could be the very same one seen on @entity39 streets the @entity266 can broadcast on any @entity267 , @entity268 , shortwave or television frequency , meaning that the @entity96 military could interrupt or overwhelm any broadcast it chose to , replacing it with political messages designed to soften locals ' objections and encourage the acceptance of political changes that favored the @entity96 mission			1
it 's unclear what authorities in @entity281 and @entity282 intend to use the gear for			0
the @entity285 reported in 1997 , when the @entity243 platform was first tested , that similar setups had instructed @entity289 soldiers on how to surrender to @entity96 troops			0
they ' can be carried into an area on two @entity293 cargo planes , set up and begin broadcasting in about three hours , ' according to the @entity285 , which called them part of a ' psyops ' – psychological operations – approach to warfare .			0

president said monday that it 's *important* to make sure police *departments* are purchasing ' stuff that they actually need '
records from the @entity96 @entity95 show local cops are getting heavy weapons that the @entity3 does n't want to *inventory* , including $ 18 million combat helicopters
two @entity225 counties got $ 5 million mobile radio broadcast stations designed to flood enemy territory with propaganda messages
more than 89,000 rifles , including some military - grade sniper models , and more than 9,900 handguns
98 battle vehicles classified as ' combat / assault / tactical '
