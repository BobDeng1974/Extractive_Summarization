@entity1 team principal @entity0 has called on @entity2 to get their act together and help save his organisation 's season			1
@entity0 was left fuming following the opening race in @entity7 on sunday after @entity1 found themselves severely handicapped by power - unit supplier @entity2 over the course of the weekend			1
initially , the @entity11 - based marque were forced to change the power unit on @entity14 's car in between practice sessions on friday due to a problem with the engine			2
@entity1 chief @entity0 has accused engine supplier @entity2 of going backwards this season @entity14 could only manage a sixth - placed finish for @entity1 during the @entity7 @entity19 @entity1 's second driver @entity20 pulled out of sunday 's opening race with a gear box failure come the race further embarrassment followed as @entity20 , on his debut for the team following his promotion last year from @entity28 , retired on the formation lap with a suspected gearbox failure			1
@entity0 has already called on the @entity31 to introduce equalisation rules as he fears @entity33 will continue to dominate after their easy one - two around @entity35 's @entity34 , spearheaded by @entity36			0
more pertinently , though , @entity0 knows @entity2 have to up their game otherwise the rest of the campaign will be a washout			2
' @entity2 need to have a clear vision and they need it quickly , ' said @entity0			2
' you can see @entity44 have made a good step forward , whereas @entity2 at this stage appear to have made a retrograde step			2
' it 's frustrating we are effectively further back than we were in @entity50 in both power and driveability			0
' it means we have n't seen the potential of our car yet because it 's masked by the engine issues we have			0
' @entity57 ( centre ) walks back to @entity28 team garage after retiring from the @entity7 @entity19 @entity36 ( right ) and @entity60 finished first and second respectively at the @entity7 @entity19 @entity61 cruises to victory in @entity7 gp as to the steps required over the coming weeks , @entity0 added : ' first we have to understand what the problem is in order to address it			1
' until @entity2 get to the bottom of what the issues are they are very difficult to address			0
a lot of dyno running needs to be done in order to understand			0
' it 's important we regroup with @entity2 and offer support where we can because it 's obviously in a bit of a mess at the moment			1
' but we need to understand things quickly			0
across the four cars ( @entity2 also supply @entity28 ) we had two engine failures - one within five laps - and a whole bunch of reliability problems			1
' it 's not the start @entity2 can afford to have			1
' after an abysmal start to pre-season a year ago @entity1 recovered to claim three wins and finish second in the constructors ' championship , albeit a long way adrift of @entity33			0
@entity1 struggled to keep up with @entity33 , @entity93 and @entity44 at the @entity7 @entity19 @entity1 and @entity2 were expected to take a step closer this season , but instead @entity0 fears they will be cut adrift			1
asked whether @entity2 were capable of producing a championship - challenging engine , @entity0 replied : ' this year , no. ' but we need to be doing a lot better than we are			2
we need to be challenging @entity44 and @entity93			0
' if we sort the issues out then we can do that , but the drivers need to have a fair run at it and they did n't have that over the weekend			0

@entity1 chief wants engine supplier to @entity2 to improve their reliability
@entity1 's @entity20 retired at @entity7 @entity19 with gearbox failure
