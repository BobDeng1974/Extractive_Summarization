@entity0 is set to release the latest version of its @entity3 software to a million users tomorrow , as part of its biggest ever test program			1
the @entity9 software will eventually allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their @entity3 - even if the phone is in another room			1
the software has also been overhauled with a new ' flat ' look , and can search the web without having to open a browser			1
the firm is making it available to users tomorrow in a special ' preview ' version @entity0 is set to release the test version of @entity9 tomorrow , but will limit users to a million , it said			1
users can visit @entity0 to sign up - and user 's machines will then be updated to the final , free version of the software when it is released later this year			1
however , the firm did warn that @entity9 is still ' beta ' software			0
the software is the first to be overseen by @entity0 's sir @entity42 , who was recently given responsibility for the design of both hardware and software at @entity0			1
the software was first revealed at @entity0 's @entity48 in @entity49			1
during the @entity23 announcement , @entity0 's @entity20 joked that @entity51 was one of the names considered , before revealing the latest version of the software will be called @entity9			1
it is available in an unprecedented public beta which begins tomorrow			0
the software has been redesigned to look ‘ flat ’ - to resemble the latest version of the @entity60 software seen on iphones and @entity62			2
it also has a new mode that lets users easily change the colour scheme , and comes with a new online storage service called @entity68 , allowing users to automatically synchronise files across multiple @entity3 , iphones , @entity62 and even @entity71 the first thing that strikes you about @entity9 is that there is less to look at			1
gones are the bells and whistles , the fake leather and other distractions of previous versions			0
instead , what you have is , without doubt , the best looking operating system ever seen			0
@entity0 's obsession with detail is clear , and when combined with high high resolution retina display of the firm 's latest laptops , the difference is incredibly obvious			1
even the tiny details , such as a new font @entity0 designed , give everything a crisp , uncluttered feel			0
menus also now have a transparent feel , giving the system an almost glass - like feel as you move windows around			0
@entity9 now has a similar notification screen to the @entity62 and @entity101 although @entity102 is not yet available so we were unable to try out the call and ' handoff ' features , the new notification centre on screen gives a real sense that the @entity101 , @entity62 and @entity3 are now one system , system than three separate gadgets			1
notifications can carry over from your @entity101 , and the ' today ' view mimics that @entity101 users are used to			1
also surprisingly useful are the upgrades to @entity116 , the @entity3 's search system			2
searching now shows you information from @entity120 pages , and you can even search the web without having to open a seperate browser window - although it does @entity123 rather than @entity124			1
you can also do basic sums , and even currency conversions form the spotlight window , and even show you cinema times if you search for a film - a real timesaver			0
the spotlight search system is also far smarter - for instance , search for movies , and it will show you what 's on at the local cinema the mail app has also been updated , with a new ' markup ' feature that lets you easily draw on images - which is great fun to play with			2
surprisingly for what is still a test piece of software , @entity9 also feels incredibly fast and snappy			0
while it is still officially ' beta ' software , once you 've tried @entity9 , going back to the previous version is hard - as well as being the best looking os we 've ever seen , @entity9 really does give a glimpse into the future of @entity0 , where all your devices work together seamlessly - as long at they are made by @entity0			2
@entity154 the software update will improve battery life , according to @entity0 , and it has added a new ‘ markup ’ option to let users easily annotate pictures they are emailing			2
the firm has also improved the way @entity3 , @entity62 and @entity101 work together			2
for example , a new feature called @entity164 lets people drop files onto their phone from a @entity3 , while @entity169 lets people swap between devices and automatically pick up where the user left off - even if an email is half written			2
elsewhere , @entity9 now has @entity174 and phone call support to @entity3 , meaning people can send texts from their @entity3 , and even use it as a speakerphone - although this is not available in the test version as @entity180 has not yet been released			0
the new @entity9 software will be made available to a million users tomorrow as part of @entity0 's biggest ever test of its @entity3 software			1
the final version , which users of the trial version can upgrade to for free , will be available later this year for example , a feature called @entity164 lets people drop files onto their phone from a @entity3 , while @entity169 lets people swap between devices and automatically pick up where the user left off - even if an email is half written			1
elsewhere , @entity9 now has @entity174 and phone call support to @entity3 , meaning people can send texts from their @entity3 , and even use it as a speakerphone			0
@entity0 boss @entity200 said the firm ’s software had been completely redesigned to work ‘ seamlessly ’ together			0
although the preview release of @entity9 will not support these features as @entity102 has yet to be released , the final version will be able to : make and receive callswhen you receive a call on your @entity101 , you can now answer it on your @entity3 , using the built - in speakers and mics as a speakerphone			1
you can also click a phone number anywhere in @entity51 to make a call through your @entity101			0
send and receive @entity215 @entity3 can now send and receive sms and @entity217 text messages through your @entity101			2
handoffthis useful feature allows you to start an activity on one device — and pick it on another			0
if you start writing an email on your @entity101 and want to finish it on your @entity3 , your @entity101 hands it to your @entity3 with the cursor in the same location			2
the new software allows you make and receive calls using your @entity101 from a @entity3 - even if your phone is in another room speaking to 5,000 developers at the @entity230 's @entity229 , earlier this year , @entity200 said : ' while the industry declined by 5 per cent , @entity3 grew by 12 per cent			1
' @entity200 also took aim at @entity235 ’s poorly received @entity234 software			0
' over 50 per cent of our users are on the latest release			0
@entity234 shipped a year before @entity239 , and it ’s at 14 per cent			0
earlier this year , @entity200 announced @entity0 is gearing up to ' enter new product categories '			0
while the recent $ 3billion acquisition of @entity243 from rapper dr @entity244 suggests the company is potentially exploring new territories .			0
