the cost of paying gold - plated pensions to @entity4 ’s public sector workers will double over the next six years to the equivalent of £ 1,500 per family , a damning report warns today			1
between april 2011 and april 2012 , the net cost of paying the pensions of retired @entity10 workers was £ 8billion			1
but this figure is set to rocket to £ 16.2billion in 2017/18 , according to the forecast by the @entity14 , the @entity15 ’s independent watchdog			1
the cost of paying gold - plated pensions to @entity4 ¿ s public sector workers will double over the next six years to the equivalent of £ 1,500 per family experts said it makes a mockery of the government ’s claim to have tackled the problem of the ballooning cost of paying such generous pensions to the state workforce			1
it comes as unions are plotting strike action over changes to their pensions as well as other grievances			2
members of the militant @entity35 walked out on @entity36 and teachers are planning industrial action later this year			2
but the report by the think - tank the @entity41 said the figures revealed ‘ the true scale of the public sector victory in pension negotiations			0
’ under the deal , hammered out between ministers and unions barons , public sector workers will have to work longer and pay more for their pensions and many will get less when they retire			2
but the figures show how the cost of public sector pensions continues to rise at a time when the majority of private sector workers do not have a single penny in a retirement pot. to make matters worse , it does not even represent the full cost to the taxpayer of paying the pensions of retired public sector workers			1
this is because it deducts the amount contributed by the employer into their workers ’ pensions - but the ‘ employer ’ is the @entity10 , paid for by taxpayers			1
figures show how the cost of public sector pensions , for health professionals and teachers for example , continues to rise at a time when the majority of private sector workers do not have a single penny in a retirement pot in 2017/18 , the employer contribution will be around £ 17.5billion , making a total of £ 33.7billion			1
@entity86 , a pensions analyst and author of the @entity41 research , predicts the total figure will be closer to £ 39billion			1
he said : ‘ the annual cost of providing public service pensions will be over £ 1,500 per household by 2016 and rising rapidly			1
’ mr @entity86 raised his concerns about the potentially disastrous pledge by ministers not to make any further changes to public sector pensions for a quarter of a century			2
@entity98 , director of the @entity41 , warned they are rising to such an extent that ‘ they will soon represent a significant driver of the deficit			0
’ @entity104 said that public sector pensions are rising to an ' eye - watering ' amount @entity104 , a leading @entity107 lord and a former pensions spokesman , said : ‘ public sector pensions costs are due to rise by an eye - watering amount every year			2
‘ meanwhile private sector pensions are being squeezed and the @entity114 ’s quantitative easing programme is hammering annuity rates for private savers			0
‘ our coalition government has only half defused the ticking public sector pensions time bomb @entity121 left us			0

‘ we ’re all living longer , and this bill is n’t getting any smaller			0
’ a @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ the government ’s package of reform will deliver £ 430billion of savings over the next fifty years , ensuring public service pensions are affordable and sustainable in the long - term			1
‘ the reformed pension schemes will rebalance the costs more fairly between employees , employers and the taxpayer , while protecting those nearest retirement and accrued rights			0
