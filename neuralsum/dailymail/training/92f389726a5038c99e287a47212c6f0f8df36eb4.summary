@entity0 needs to learn when to keep his mouth shut is the message from @entity4 co-owner @entity3			1
the @entity4 manager was fined £ 9,000 earlier this month after claiming that referee @entity6 had been influenced by @entity8 players during the home defeat against the @entity11 leaders in october			1
@entity6 had sent off @entity12 at @entity13 , with @entity14 that there were double standards at play after @entity18 did n’t receive similar treatment			0
and , while @entity0 admitted to his faults three weeks ago , @entity3 has reiterated that he must bite his tongue more in future			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 has been warned to keep quiet about referees by @entity3 @entity24 , pictured with @entity25 , does n't believe @entity0 's complaints help the club with matches ‘ i do n’t think @entity0 should complain about referees , ’ @entity3 told the @entity29			1
‘ i ’ve told him that			0
i do n’t think it helps us with matches			0
‘ i do n’t think a manager should do anything other than try to help his club			2
’ while @entity0 ’s conduct has been an important recent issue , so too have performances under his stewardship			1
that , however , took a turn for the better on sunday with the 3 - 1 demolition of @entity43			1
it has the enthusiastic @entity24 dreaming of @entity46			0
@entity4 midfielder @entity47 ( second left ) celebrates scoring in sunday 's 3 - 1 win over @entity43 ‘ there ’s no reason why @entity4 ca n’t cement itself as a @entity52 challenging club			1
the @entity53 is really difficult for any club outside the top four or five			2
‘ you might get the odd wild card			0
the next level down - right down to ninth - is very flat now			0
’ and he does n’t see a problem in bridging the gap between @entity4 and those who consistently occupy the @entity63 places in the top flight			2
‘ @entity65 probably have about £ 10 - 11million more @entity67 income than us , that ’s it , ’ he added			0
‘ so it ’s not like the old days when their gate money was a significant differentiator in the ability to spend and compete			0
