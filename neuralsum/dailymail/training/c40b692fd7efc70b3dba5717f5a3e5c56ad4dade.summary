by @entity0 according to @entity2 , @entity1 is the one forward in the @entity3 who is impossible to prepare for			1
it ’s his movement , @entity7 ’s manager will tell you			0
he ’s so clever and so full of running , there is very little you can tell a defender ahead of an encounter with the @entity14 striker			2
the energy levels certainly are astonishing , as @entity1 once again demonstrated here at @entity16			2
video : scroll down to see @entity20 ' post-match press conference stamina : @entity1 's energy levels were impressive once again in the @entity16 draw with @entity23 high praise : @entity7 manager @entity2 claimed @entity1 was the most difficult player to prepare for when @entity26 accelerated past @entity27 shortly before half - time , it was @entity1 who tracked back to make the vital interception when his colleagues in midfield had already decided that they would leave it to a defence in serious danger of conceding a second goal			1
when they were eventually beaten for a second time , in the fourth minute of second - half stoppage time , it was @entity1 who burst down the right wing to deliver what proved the last of @entity14 ’s 81 crosses			1
@entity1 who mustered one last effort from the depths of his astonishing reserves			2
he gave everything against @entity23 , as he always does			0
but you have to question why he was making that run from the central midfield position he had been asked to occupy for the final 30 minutes of the game			0
losing battle ? @entity1 gave everything against @entity23 ... but why was he played in central midfield late on ? worry : @entity20 needs to work out the best formation for his side @entity1 's heat map shows him dropping off to find possession , see more stats at our fabulous match zone service just as you have to ask why , when he is such a potent force , is it @entity1 who so often pays the price for his versatility			1
part of the problem , it would seem , is accommodating @entity72 and @entity1 in the same side when they like to drift into much the same territory on a football pitch			1
@entity20 tried to solve the problem by deploying @entity72 on the right flank and leaving @entity1 to partner @entity79 in attack			1
but @entity14 ’s new £ 37million signing was soon moving inside and the more this match progressed the more the thinking behind how to use these two players looked confused			2
@entity72 is a good signing for @entity85 , arriving at a time when a lack of creativity in the final third of the pitch has been a problem			1
but , after a decent debut against @entity94 , the @entity92 has endured two rather less impressive performances and that has to be a concern			0
the fact that @entity1 was absent from @entity14 ’s starting line - up for the first of @entity72 ’s three games — and has been on the pitch for the two games since then — is sure to puzzle @entity20			1
as is the fact that , of those 81 crosses , only 18 reached a @entity14 player			2
same position : @entity72 cuts in from the right , giving @entity1 less space to express himself in the middle shambles : are the defensive frailties that let @entity113 score more of a worry for @entity20 ? in fairness , @entity23 defended so deep any side would have found it difficult to break through			1
particularly when players like @entity119 and @entity120 were as impressive as they were in protecting @entity23 ’s goal			0
but on an afternoon when @entity14 enjoyed 75 per cent of the ball , it should have been an awful lot more comfortable than it was			2
@entity85 might argue that there were greater concerns			0
the ‘ diabolical ’ defending that enabled @entity113 to score @entity23 ’s equaliser , for instance			0
as a contest , however , it should have been settled long before then and @entity20 might have to recognise that @entity1 is not the player who should be sacrificed when the team actually need to be built around him			1
no good : @entity1 has to be @entity14 's next captain ... the departing @entity27 looks lost making him @entity14 ’s captain would come with certain risks , not least because controversy has so often been his companion			1
in sunday 's newspapers @entity20 seemed to be hinting at such fears			0
but if @entity14 ’s beleaguered manager wants a captain who leads by example , who plays with an appetite that we used to see here in @entity149 , then @entity1 is every inch the man			1
@entity27 , wonderful servant though he has been , has revealed his intention to move on and his role in @entity23 ’s equaliser suggested a significant part of him has left already			0
there is much @entity20 needs to resolve and fast given the predicament his stuttering side are now in			0
but recognising the full extent of what @entity1 offers would be a start			0
as well as playing him in the right position , he might want to consider handing him the captain ’s armband , too			0
it could be just the catalyst @entity20 needs .			0

@entity1 and @entity72 are fighting for the same area of the pitch
@entity20 should not be dropping his best player back to midfield
@entity14 should centre their play around @entity1
@entity27 has lost his appetite and @entity1 should be given captaincy
