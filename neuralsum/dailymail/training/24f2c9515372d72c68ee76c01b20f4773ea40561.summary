he emerged from his @entity2 home with a characteristic smirk and a dark glance , and girlfriend @entity5 firmly on his arm			1
then , with brutally sardonic humour , @entity7 proceeded to make a joke of yet another disturbing set of pictures of him sitting at an outside table at @entity14 , his favourite @entity16 restaurant , and seemingly reducing a girlfriend to tears			1
last summer , it was this very restaurant — and , indeed , this very table — that was the location for the ‘ throttling ’ lunch that spelled the end of @entity23 ’s marriage to @entity24			1
lunch : @entity7 had a meal with girlfriend @entity5 at @entity14 , the @entity16 seafood restaurant , a week after she was spotted there in tears @entity7 enjoys a glass of wine during lunch on sunday at @entity33 's with @entity5			1
the two sat outside in a public display which came as pictures of them arguing at the same spot a week earlier were published in pictures revealed yesterday , he is seen there again			0
only this time , it is @entity5 , his girlfriend of almost a year , who is clearly seen in serious distress , weeping over her ginger ale			2
@entity23 looks on apparently unmoved , smoking cigarettes and drinking most of a bottle of red wine			1
at one point , @entity5 removes her sunglasses to wipe away the tears			2
at another , she leaps to her feet , apparently shouting in fury			0
a witness to the incident says that @entity23 glanced around him to check if anyone had noticed what was going on			2
@entity5 shows her boyfriend @entity7 something on her mobile yesterday @entity7 rubs his nose outside @entity33 's , the @entity16 seafood restaurant , as he dines with girlfriend @entity5 a week after she cried at the same spot lawyers for the couple deny there was an argument of any sort			1
but @entity5 , 50 , who friends declare is ‘ the nicest woman in @entity70 ’ , appeared animated , even distraught at times			2
after the meal , the pair left together in a taxi			1
@entity23 , 70 , got up first and stood at the taxi rank while @entity5 took a few moments , seemingly to compose herself , before joining him			1
the parallels to the infamous @entity24 incident are crashingly obvious			0
those shocking pictures , in which the multi-millionaire art collector repeatedly put his hands around @entity24 ’s throat to her evident distress , resulted in a police caution for him			0
so , how did @entity23 explain this latest damaging contretemps yesterday ? standing outside his @entity2 home , the former advertising executive merely declared to the @entity89 that he and @entity5 were ‘ unconsciously coupling ’			1
art collector and advertising guru @entity7 wipes his mouth outside @entity33 's in @entity16 as girlfriend @entity5 gazes into the distance yesterday in keeping with his dark sense of humour , @entity23 twisted the phrase ‘ consciously uncoupling ’ , coined by actress @entity96 to describe her separation from @entity99 star @entity98			1
@entity23 then ushered @entity100 , 50 , into a taxi , adding : ‘ there , are you happy now ? ’ and off they went for sunday lunch			2
where ? why , to the very same table at @entity14 , of course			0
someone who knows both of them intimately insisted to me yesterday : ‘ there is no story			0
they are very happy together			0
’ but can this be true — or is history about to repeat itself in @entity23 ’s new relationship ? certainly , it seems that @entity23 , a dictatorial bully , has replaced one vulnerable woman with another			2
but , until now , he and @entity5 have found a certain peculiar contentment with each other			2
the pair started dating only eight weeks after the schism with @entity24 and before the trial of the @entity130 sisters , the couple ’s former housekeepers			0
@entity5 cracks a smile outside @entity33 's but boyfriend @entity7 seems lost in thought it was during the trial that @entity24 admitted she occasionally used cocaine and @entity23 contended that his actions during their notorious lunch were merely intended to help his wife ‘ focus ’			1
it was a strange time to begin a hunt for a new love — but the extraordinary truth is that @entity23 actually selected @entity5 from a shortlist drawn up by his second wife , @entity145 , to whom he is still close			1
she was terribly worried that he was ‘ falling apart ’ without a woman by his side			0
others on the list included @entity152 , the newly single film - maker sister of actor @entity153			0
i ’m told that upon meeting @entity5 , @entity23 murmured , horror - struck : ‘ my @entity155 ! those lips ! ’ but despite his initial misgivings , the liaison became very serious , very quickly			1
@entity5 , too , was n’t bothered by @entity23 ’s reputation			1
one friend even went so far as to ask her on her publicly accessible @entity163 account last october : ‘ i have a personal question			0
how can you date a man who tried to strangle his ex-wife ? you are a smart woman , i ca n’t understand			0
you are worth so much more ! ’ @entity5 responded : ‘ my darling girl — do n’t believe what you read in the press ! ! ! ! ’ within three months , @entity5 was keeping a toothbrush and clothes at the house in @entity2 that @entity23 used to share with @entity24 and her children			1
he and @entity5 dined out incessantly , often at @entity14			2
@entity7 and girlfriend @entity5 walk along a @entity16 street ( left ) having arrived from his @entity2 home in a taxi ( right ) during the @entity130 trial in december , they seemed to be in high spirits , which is more commonly seen in much younger lovers			1
i am told @entity23 has spent time with @entity5 ’s ten - year - old daughter , @entity185 , by her former husband @entity187			1
the truth is that @entity5 enjoys @entity23 ’s dictatorial bent			1
a few months after her 50th birthday , @entity5 looks unhappy as she dines out with boyfriend @entity23			1
the meal a week ago ended with the tv personality in tears the picture that ended @entity7 's marriage to @entity24 - taken outside the same restaurant , @entity33 's of @entity16 - where he had a spat with current girlfriend @entity5 and while @entity5 , a recovering drink and drug addict , is notably more sensitive than @entity24 , she , too , seems to love the lifestyle @entity23 provides her with			1
for example , over @entity203 , @entity23 treated @entity5 and @entity185 to a @entity206 trip on a £ 25million yacht			1
in february , he took her on a romantic break to @entity210 to celebrate her 50th birthday			0
with her fondness for twice - yearly botox , @entity214 dresses and £ 180 pots of @entity216 face cream , she is not a low - maintenance partner			0
in echoes of @entity24 , @entity5 jokes that she is now addicted to ‘ sugar and spending ’			2
and she , too , has something of an attraction to ‘ damaged ’ lovers			0
her romantic history , which includes liaisons with a playboy who died of a cocaine overdose and a marriage to a banker who fought an addiction to painkillers , may mean she is able to handle someone as temperamental as the thrice - divorced @entity23			2
a month ago came a surprising episode			0
@entity5 and @entity23 were guests at the opening of superchef @entity239 ’s restaurant at the @entity240 in @entity241			1
it was the sort of event that @entity5 and her socialite friends adore — but to observe the notoriously reclusive @entity23 enjoying blue lobster and purple artichoke with half of @entity70 ’s canape society came as a shock			1
all indications — until these new unsettling images — were of a very happy romance indeed			0
so why the tears ? yesterday , friends of @entity23 ’s were pressing the suggestion that @entity5 may have been complaining of continuing back pain , as only four weeks ago she had a disc replaced			1
that relatively major surgery saw her bed - bound for a week			0
she is contemplating facing the school holidays with her daughter in less than perfect health			0
the only clue to her condition is she is wearing thick - soled trainers rather than her usual heels			0
@entity7 , meanwhile , knows only too well that his romance with @entity5 has been a surprisingly effective tool in rehabilitating his image			1
if people believe he has been bullying her as well , he will lose the pr war he has fought heartily since his split from @entity24			0
when contacted by a sunday newspaper about the pictures , @entity23 denied there had been an argument			2
in a callous piece of humour , he emailed the reporter : ‘ why not send a photographer to @entity33 ’s tomorrow lunchtime and i will give @entity5 a good throttling in time for your deadline ? ’ @entity285 came bluster , when he again emailed the reporter saying : ‘ please do n’t do this			2
’ after what appeared to be a public fight at @entity33 's restaurant last weekend @entity5 seems to have forgiven @entity7 and returns to his home with a couple of suitcases just before @entity5 turned up at his @entity2 home with two suitcases last weekend after their public spat , @entity7 and his 19 - year - old daughter @entity301 arrived there and appeared to be in a playful mood finally , came bullying			1
‘ oh just run what you like , ’ he exclaimed			0
‘ how would you like it if someone was looking at you [ when you were eating ] ? it is a lie			0
i do n’t care what it looks like , you can ask me formally through my lawyer			0
’ a letter from a lawyer acting for @entity5 and @entity23 swiftly followed			1
for her part , @entity5 has even employed the same dark humour			2
musing in february about her landmark birthday , she wrote online : ‘ it ’s great that , at 50 , life can still grab you by the throat and shake you up			0
’ unfortunately for @entity23 , little has dented @entity24 ’s popularity			2
her @entity327 tv show the taste has been given a third series and she lives happily in west @entity70 with her children			0
what poison this must be for him			0
but , in the wake of recent events , the question must be : is @entity23 ’s search for a life partner on again ?			0

@entity23 looks on unmoved , smoking cigarettes and drinking red wine
after the meal , the pair left @entity16 restaurant together in a taxi
@entity5 later arrived at @entity7 's @entity2 home with two suitcases
