while the international community debates what to do about @entity2 , evidence of the use of chemical weapons dating back 1,700 years has surfaced			0
@entity7 archeologist dr @entity6 believes 20 @entity9 soldiers may have been killed by lethal poisonous gas during a @entity12 attack on their fort at @entity14 in @entity2 during the 3rd century			1
if true , it would be one of the earliest documented incidents of chemical weapons			0
poisoned : this skeleton provides evidence of one of the earliest chemical weapons attacks in @entity2 the soldiers met their fate in a narrow space in around 256ad , according to a statement by the @entity28 academic in 2009			2
speaking at the time , dr @entity6 said : ' for the @entity12 to kill 20 men in a space less than two metres high or wide , and about 11 metres long , required superhuman combat powers , or something more insidious			2
' i think the ( @entity12 ) placed braziers and bellows in their gallery , and when the @entity9 broke through , added the chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the @entity9 tunnel			1
' the @entity9 assault party were unconscious in seconds , dead in minutes			1
' dr @entity6 was alerted to the evidence by mineral residue near the bodies			0
he concluded the gas was created by adding a compound of burnt bitumen and sulfur to fire			1
fumes : an archeologist from the @entity28 believes @entity9 soldiers were gassed by @entity12 speaking to @entity54 in 2009 , dr @entity6 said : ' these provided the vital clue			1
when ignited , such materials give off dense clouds of choking gases			0
' he also rediscovered the body of a @entity12 soldier , the man who probably ignited the poisonous weapon			0
he added : ' he lingered too long to ensure it was alight , and was himself overcome by fumes from the bitumen and sulfur he used to start the blaze			0
' earlier this week @entity71 , a research scholar in classics and history of science at @entity75 , told @entity54 that chemically enhanced accelerants had been documented in even older battles , including the 429 bc @entity78			0
but the @entity12 attack may represent one of the first documented instances of soldiers purposefully producing toxic fumes			2
bellows : when @entity9 soldiers broke out , the poisonous gases were pumped into a narrow tunnel			1

@entity12 may have used poisoned gas to kill @entity9 soldiers during siege
they pumped a compound of bitumen and sulfur into narrow tunnel
the *victims* would have been *knocked* out in seconds and dead in minutes
