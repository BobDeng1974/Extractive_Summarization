@entity9 , which has been accused of making unfair decisions on when sick and disabled people lose benefits , was ordered to review its tests last summer after a government report found its assessors were of unacceptably poor quality			1
but yesterday , sources in the @entity19 it company claimed it was pulling out as its staff were increasingly coming under attack while carrying out their work			1
protesters hold placards outside @entity9 's @entity27 headquarters in august 2012 each month last year they recorded about 160 incidents of the public assaulting or abusing staff , the @entity28 reported			1
protests had erupted outside their offices this week , when staff received deaths threats in person and on @entity37 and @entity38			0
examples on social networking sites include someone calling staff ‘ murdering scumbags ’ , adding : ‘ we wo n’t be smiling when we come to hang you b * * * * * * s. ’ another said : ‘ know anyone who works for @entity9 ? kill them			1
’ the company has regularly come under fire over the assessments – which are used to gauge eligibility for employment and support allowance and incapacity benefit – amid claims people are being wrongly recommended for work or put through stressful medical interviews			0
one third of its decisions have been overturned on appeal and the firm has become a lightning rod for left - wing critics of the government ’s welfare reforms			0
@entity9 revealed it has been in discussions with officials for ‘ several months ’ about ending its work capability assessment contract , which was due to run until august 2015			1

our focus remains on delivering the services we are contracted to provide in a professional and compassionate way until a new service begins			0
’ however , relations with the @entity89 appear to be close to breakdown amid persistent criticism over the quality of @entity9 ’s assessments			2
@entity72 , shadow minister for disabled people , said : ‘ people have been badly let down by @entity9			2
