he is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time , but it seems the remarkable career of @entity5 may be coming to a crashing halt			2
only four games into the season , the @entity8 star and owner of three @entity11 rings has been putting up abysmal numbers , resulting in two losses for his team , an early season rarity for the storied dynasty			2
even worse , the @entity8 second - string quarterback , @entity19 , replaced @entity5 in last night 's game against the @entity21 , and looked like the far more experienced and capable player of the two			1
since their shocking @entity11 win in 2001 , @entity5 and the @entity8 have posted numbers unlike any team in the history of football , with five @entity11 appearances in just 11 seasons and three @entity11 wins , as well as becoming the only team since the league expanded the regular season to 16 games in 1978 to go undefeated back in 2007			2
the force behind all of this has been @entity5 , who , at 37 , is one of only two players , alongside @entity45 , in @entity30 history to win the @entity30 @entity48 and @entity49 awards multiple times			0
he also holds the record for postseason passing yards , places third on the list for postseason touchdowns , and has won an astonishing 148 regular season games and 18 postseason games , numbers that are even more impressive considering he was one of the last players picked in the 2000 draft			0
dynasty : @entity5 has led the @entity8 to three @entity11 wins , in 2001 , 2003 ( right ) and 2004 ( left ) dynamic duo : @entity5 and @entity8 coach @entity64 ( above ) are one of the greatest tandems in the history of football coming up : @entity8 second - string quarterback @entity19 ( above ) has been showing plenty of promise this season however is a far different story , with the man who was long believed by many to be untouchable posting numbers that are no doubt causing major concern for his boss , and biggest champion , @entity8 coach @entity64			1
he is completing just 59 percent of his passes and has only 791 yards , and four touchdowns , in the first four games of the season			0
last night against the @entity21 he had only 159 yards before he was pulled from the game by @entity64 , this after his second interception			1
and the @entity21 did not just beat the @entity8 , they routed the team , going up 41 - 7 at one point , the most @entity5 has ever been down in a game			1
no doubt making matters much , much worse for @entity5 was the performance of @entity19 last night , whose story as the good looking backup who comes in to save the day and plays remarkably cool under pressure is eerily similar to the one that played out between @entity5 and former @entity8 quarterback @entity96 back in 2001			1
personal life : @entity5 's wife @entity98 ( above ) is one of the biggest models in the world family : @entity98 opened the @entity102 show in @entity103 earlier today ( above left ) and the couple have two children , @entity107 and @entity108 ( right ) that being said , this is still the @entity8 , the one team that should never be counted out			1
they started the 2001 season at 0 - 2 before going on to win the @entity11 , and @entity64 and @entity5 still remain perhaps the greatest tandem in the history of the sport , or any sport for that matter			2
of course , if things do n't get better for @entity5 , there 's no need to feel too concerned for the man			0
he signed a five - year , $ 57 million contract in 2013 meaning he will likely play through the 2017 season			0
furthermore , his wife , and mother to his two children , @entity107 and @entity108 , is 34 - year - old @entity98 , one of the most successful models of all time who is still without question at the top of her game , having just opened the @entity102 show in @entity103 earlier today			0
and there is no question that no matter what happens this season or next season or the season after that , @entity5 will go down as one of the greatest to play the game			0

many believe @entity5 's reign as one of the best quarterbacks in the @entity30 may be coming to an end following his poor performance so far this season
@entity5 has thrown for only four touchdowns this season , and had two interceptions last night against the @entity21
@entity8 coach @entity64 even pulled @entity5 from the game last night and put in @entity19 , the team 's promising second - string quarterback
