by @entity0 published : 03:46 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 04:08 est , 6 january 2014 find : the skeletons of four adults and a child have been discovered behind a townhouse in central @entity6 they were the real - life bogeymen whose murderous trade in bodies for medical research led to their names going down forever in infamy			1
now , bones from five skeletons found in a shallow grave behind an upmarket townhouse in @entity6 are thought to be linked to the period of ' resurrectionists ' @entity19 and @entity19			1
archaeologists have determined that the five bodies - four adults and one child , which were found in @entity24 in the @entity26 area of the capital - date back to the early 19th century			1
@entity19 gained their murderous reputation after killing 16 people in the city in 1828 and selling the bodies			1
at the time there was a market for corpses and the remains are thought to belong to criminals or dwellers of poorhouses , who could also be sold on			0
@entity39 , from the @entity40 , was the first to examine the remains on site			0
he said : ' at the end of the @entity46 period there was significant demand for cadavers - which indeed outstripped supply - and that led to a thriving illegal trade , with @entity19 clearly the most infamous of those who supplied bodies to medical schools			1
' we ca n't rule out that those found on @entity24 were sold by the resurrectionists , as they were called , although it might be a stretch to say it was @entity19 themselves , given their crimes are well documented			1
' it is possible that , given the fact they may have been acquired illegally , that someone should wish to bury them , or it could have been as simple as a house clearance			0
' what we do know is that these were used to train the surgeons of the future and are a relic of our heritage , of that early stage of modern medicine			0
' i 'm not sure how far the project will go but there are techniques to determine where the remains came from by the kind of water they drank , the diet they had			0
' it was just a chance discovery but despite the length of time that has passed we always like to put the person into context , how old they were , how they died , who they were			0
' murderers : @entity99 serial killers @entity19 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) @entity100 , a lead archaeologist at consultants @entity102 , said : ' we found four right - sided jaws and we also had enough bone likely to be a young person			1
there were quite a few little holes in them which were to cater for wires , which leads us to believe they were used for anatomical purposes			0
' we found they were likely to date back to the early 1800s , and although there were no medical professionals living in the house , we believe they had friends who were			1
' @entity99 immigrants @entity19 sold the bodies of the dead on to dr @entity122 to use for medical research and teaching			1
when they were arrested , @entity19 was offered immunity from prosecution if he testified against @entity19 , as authorities feared they would blame each other - making it difficult for a jury to convict			2
more than 25,000 people watched @entity132 in 1829 while @entity19 disappeared after his release			1
@entity19 's skeleton is displayed at the @entity136 's @entity135			2
his death mask is exhibited at @entity138 in the capital			0
over a period of ten months in 1828 , 16 murders were committed in the @entity143 capital			2
the killings were carried out by two @entity99 immigrants @entity19 and @entity19 - who then sold the corpses of their victims			1
local doctor @entity122 received the bodies as dissection material for his anatomy lectures			0
in order to keep the bodies in a good condition , the two killed their victims by smothering them , compressing their chests until they died			1
the duo did not work alone			0
@entity19 's mistress @entity157 and @entity158 , @entity19 's wife , assisted them in their murderous spree			2
@entity19 was born in @entity162 , @entity163			2
he left his family - a wife and two children - to emigrate to @entity143 in around 1817 , and met his mistress while working on the @entity168			0
@entity19 's birthplace is less certainly documented , but it is thought he was from either @entity170 near @entity171 , or @entity172			2
he emigrated to @entity143 and also worked as a labourer on the @entity168			0
the duo met when @entity19 and his mistress moved in to @entity19 's wife 's lodgings in around 1827			0
according to @entity19 ' testimony - the first body the duo sold was that of a tenant who died of natural causes in november of that year			1
@entity19 was executed in 1829 but hare escaped being hanged after giving evidence against his former accomplice .			0
