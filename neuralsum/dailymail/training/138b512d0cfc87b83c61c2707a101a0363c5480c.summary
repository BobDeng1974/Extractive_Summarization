this is the first @entity2 @entity1 has n’t been directly involved in for more than 20 years , yet the crowning glory of a lifetime ’s work will be felt in the @entity6 on sunday night when the whole of @entity8 stops to see how @entity9 perform against @entity10 and @entity11			1
make no mistake , @entity8 is going ‘ soccer - crazy ’			2
not in an underground kind of way , but mainstream crazy , with millions following every kick and @entity19 celebrities tweeting about the hottest show in town			2
there will be tens of thousands of @entity9 fans in @entity24 — 90,000 @entity2 tickets were sold in @entity8 for this tournament , more than in any other country bar hosts @entity28 — and more than 20million viewers are expected to tune in			1
to put it into context , only 18m saw @entity32 become basketball ’s @entity33 champions last week			2
but none of it would have been possible without our greatest @entity71 export			2
@entity1 has galvanised interest since he shocked the world by leaving @entity75 for @entity76 in 2007			1
four years ago , @entity1 was in the @entity78 dug - out alongside @entity79 , having played in the three previous @entity80			1
for @entity40 , son of @entity81 and @entity83 legend @entity82 and someone who has been in @entity8 for eight years as a player , coach and manager , @entity1 has created a monster in terms of public interest			1
‘ i would n’t say soccer has grown at grassroots level too much because it was already the most popular participant sport ahead of baseball and basketball , even when i arrived in 2006 to play for @entity95 , ’ he said			0
‘ the big game - changer in terms of its growth as a professional sport was when @entity1 arrived in 2007			1
‘ he is more than a soccer player , he is an icon ; a franchise in himself			0
the @entity37 league here had only 12 teams when he arrived — next year there will be 21			1
he was a catalyst in making the sport mainstream and getting people to spend more money to watch soccer			0
’ the myth of the @entity9 being inward - looking , whose sports teams call themselves world champions without leaving @entity8 , has been shattered			0
basketball superstar @entity115 gave his 13m @entity117 followers a blow - by - blow commentary of the @entity9 ’s first game , posting immediately after @entity121 ’s 30 - second opening goal against @entity65 : ‘ now , that ’s how you start a game ! ’ american dream start : @entity121 celebrates his quickfire opener after catching @entity65 cold @entity128 is an avowed fan and even the @entity129 shared the joy after @entity131 headed @entity9 ’s winning goal against @entity65			0
‘ congrats ! great start at the @entity2 , ’ they tweeted.interest in sunday ’s game has not been topped , even when @entity8 hosted the @entity2 in 1994			1
the first four pages of the @entity138 were dedicated to soccer last week and @entity141 ’s decision to leave out the country ’s most famous player , @entity142 , caused almost as much hysteria as @entity145 did when he jettisoned @entity146 in 1998			0
‘ the backlash was intense but what it did was put a lot more attention on the national team , ’ said @entity40			0
‘ the one name everyone is familiar with , even by those who do n’t follow the game closely , is @entity142			0
he ’s the greatest footballer the @entity42 has ever produced			1
’ disbelief : @entity131 celebrates his late headed winner for the @entity42 jumping for joy : @entity121 hit the heights after giving the @entity42 the lead in @entity160 fortunately for the @entity161 , beating @entity65 has lifted the pressure , although expectations are now sky - high for the @entity11 game			1
@entity42 probably need a result to qualify , with @entity166 lying in wait for their final group game			1
despite knee problems , @entity10 is capable of beating any team but midfielder @entity172 , who plays for @entity37 side @entity173 where @entity40 is assistant - coach , says @entity9 are ready			1
‘ we ’ve watched @entity11 closely , even their warm - up games against @entity177 and @entity178 , ’ he said			1
‘ there are guys like @entity181 and @entity121 who realise that while we were ecstatic to beat @entity65 , we have to come down from the cloud and get ourselves ready , because one win is n’t enough			0
‘ everyone knows about @entity10 and we know he ’ll be motivated after the first game ( @entity166 won 4 - 0 )			0
’ as for the support , he added : ‘ it is special			0
there was just a buzz around the stadium against @entity65			0
it ’s caught us off guard that so many @entity42 are here			2
it was really emotional during the national anthem			0
’ @entity40 has only to take a straw poll of one to realise soccer is really taking off			0
‘ my wife is @entity42 but she does n’t take too much interest in soccer generally or the @entity37 , even though it ’s my job			1
but she wo n’t be missing sunday ’s @entity2 game for anything			1
’ @entity10 will be centre - stage but the excitement would not have been created without @entity1			2
‘ @entity10 and @entity204 are well known in @entity8 as footballers but nowhere like the same level of fame as @entity1			2
he was on billboards , he was on @entity209 ( a chat - show for a-list celebrities ) , ’ said @entity40			0
‘ when he arrived , he literally sold out stadiums because people wanted to see him play			0
‘ he may be retired but you can see at this @entity2 , the impact he had lives on			2

son of former @entity81 boss , @entity82 , now coaches in the @entity37 and says @entity1 has sent popularity of football *soaring* since his move to @entity76 in 2007
