by @entity0 a pensioner who was given an incorrect £ 80,000 energy bill from @entity3 is celebrating victory after winning a 12 - year legal battle against the energy giants			1
. @entity7 , 74 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was overcharged £ 35,000 for gas and electricity at a sports club he helped build and was taken to court five times over false readings			1
the grandfather - of - six claims he suffered a stroke as a result of stress brought on by the costly legal process , but says he is satisfied as the amount has now been written off			1
victory : @entity7 , 74 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , sought legal action after he was taken to court five times over false readings mr @entity7 helped build the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity9 , for local children and football clubs to enjoy in 1992			1
in 2000 , @entity3 changed the electric meter at the club and two years later he noticed his electricity charges seemed extortionately high			1
between 1999 and 2014 , he used £ 49,000 worth of electricity , but was charged £ 80,000			2
he was then hounded for payments , even though the amount was inaccurate			2
the company even went to court on five occasions seeking a warrant to have his supplies disconnected			2
after he refused to pay the entire fee , @entity3 sent in debt recovery agents 2012			1
it prompted him to seek legal advice of his own , and after a lengthy dispute the difference was written off			2
false : the incorrect bills were based on electricity and gas used at the @entity23 , in @entity24 , @entity9 , which mr @entity7 helped build for local children to use today mr @entity7 , said the court costs had exceeded the £ 80,000 bill he was contesting but declared : ' it was more a matter of principle			1
' he added : ' all i wanted to do was to say that i did not owe that sort of money			0
it has been very stressful but i am satisfied now in what i did			0
' it is 12 years of hard work but it has all paid off and i just want other people to know they do n’t have to roll over be bullied by these fat cats from huge companies			0
' i have been to the magistrates about six times			0
i was determined not to pay the money			0
that sort of money for a small club is ridiculous			2
' i actually had to remortgage my house in order to keep in going for as long as i did			0
it was a matter of principle			0
' victim : mr @entity75 said he suffered a stroke due to the stress of the court proceedings the father - of - three remained manager of @entity23 for nearly twenty years but said the court battle meant he had to close the club in 2010			1
it has now been taken on by new owners			0
mr @entity7 , who lives in @entity8 , @entity9 , with his wife of 49 - years @entity86 , 69 , added : ' that club was my pride and joy , its costs me that as well			1
' as well as the errors with the electricity they tried to charge me for units of gas that i had never used at the club			2
' they went three years without visiting and just kept sending very high estimated bills			2
i was being charged for tens of thousands of units that i had never used			0
' mr @entity7 said he does not now intend to pursue @entity3 in a civil case for damages due to the ill health he has suffered in the past two years			1
he had already made a partially successful complaint to the @entity105 in 2011 but he said @entity3 ' had not done everything he had asked			0
' he added : ' the ombudsman never really understood			0
he made a partially helpful decision in november 2011 , but even then @entity3 did not do all that he had asked			0
' @entity109 , from @entity110 , who began representing mr @entity7 in 2012 , said : ' mr @entity7 is a pillar of the local community			1
' he has been a fantastic supporter of grass roots football and social activities for decades			0
we advised that on this occasion actual legal proceedings against @entity3 should be seen as a costly last resort			0
' that being said , it took a year of patient negotiation to finally get the case in to the right hands within @entity3			0
' @entity124 of @entity125 said : ' we apologise for the prolonged difficulties that mr @entity7 has faced with his energy bills , as we make every effort to resolve complaints swiftly for our customers			1
@entity131 : he was overcharged by £ 35,000 at @entity23 , an amount that was written off during the dispute ' in this case there were a number of issues on his account dating back to 1999 , which resulted in estimated or incorrect bills			1
' we worked to resolve this , but were unable for a number of years to access the property to read the gas and electricity meters			0
' we take the outcome of any ombudsman complaint very seriously and implemented all remedies in 2011 to help reduce mr @entity7 ’s bill			1
' we have now put in place a suitable payment arrangement with the current account holder for @entity152 and agreed to write off the remaining balance left for mr @entity7 to pay as a gesture of goodwill in recognition of his circumstances			1
