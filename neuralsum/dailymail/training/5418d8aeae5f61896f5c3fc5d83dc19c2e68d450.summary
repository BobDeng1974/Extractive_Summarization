' such was the impact of his departure that @entity5 shares fell more than 5 per cent in @entity114 , briefly wiping £ 80million off the market value of the club			2
@entity2 's decision was a major shock coming so soon after he clinched his 13th @entity75 title with the club , one of his 38 trophies including two @entity123 trophies			1
