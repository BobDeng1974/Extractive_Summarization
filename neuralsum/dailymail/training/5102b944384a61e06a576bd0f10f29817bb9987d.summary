the @entity1 account of @entity3 star @entity2 was hacked yesterday with an offensive message posted about his stillborn child			1
@entity2 was targeted by an internet troll who posted the disturbing message after a court ruling that the singer had invested in a massive tax avoidance scheme			1
the message , which is too offensive to repeat , was removed after eight minutes but in that time had been re-tweeted hundreds of times			1
the @entity26 reported a spokesman for @entity2 confirmed his @entity1 account was hacked on monday lunchtime			2
the news comes as @entity31 yesterday insisted that he should be allowed to keep his obe , despite a court ruling that he had invested in a massive tax avoidance scheme			1
the @entity3 star – and prominent @entity37 supporter – has faced a barrage of criticism , with mp @entity40 branding him ‘ unethical ’ and others calling for him to hand back the honour			1
but mr @entity31 believes the measure is unnecessary			2
prime minister @entity31 said it is not ' necessary ' for @entity2 to hand back his obe the prime minister insisted the singer had ' done a huge amount for the country ' including raising money for charity			1
@entity37 - supporting @entity2 , 43 , and bandmates @entity51 , 46 , @entity52 , 42 , and their manager @entity53 , poured £ 66million into @entity54 , which styled itself as a music industry investment scheme			1
however a judge ruled last week that it was in fact a tax shelter designed to help the super-rich avoid paying income tax			2
the band members – of which @entity2 was the biggest investor – are now likely to face repaying £ 20million to @entity65			2
@entity66 , the @entity67 chairman of the commons public accounts committee , claimed @entity2 ' might want to show a bit of contrition by giving back his obe '			1
but mr @entity31 rejected the idea			2
he told @entity72 's @entity73 : ' i do n’t think that ’s necessary frankly			0
@entity2 has done a huge amount for the country , he ’s raised money for charity , he ’s done very well for @entity80 so i ’m not sure ... ' the obe was in respect of that work and what he ’s done but clearly what this scheme was was wrong and it ’s right that they ’re going to pay back the money			1
' mr @entity31 said he was against aggressive tax avoidance schemes , and it was right that @entity2 and the other @entity3 stars returned the money @entity91 mayor @entity90 also insisted the singer should be allowed to keep his gong			1
he told @entity94 : ' should @entity2 lose his obe following his multi-million pound tax dodge ? should @entity2 lose his obe following his multi-million pound tax dodge ? now share your opinion ' we will want to see him coughing up in the same way as everybody else			1
but i do n’t think as far as i understand the matter that he ’s done anything illegal , has he ? ' as far as i ’m concerned there are n’t any criminal charges against him or whatever			0
i think he should cough up but on the @entity18 question that people keep asking me , i do n’t think there ’s any need for him to hand back his obe			1
' @entity2 backed the @entity37 at the last election , joining mr @entity31 just weeks before polling day at a policy launch			1
it is believed the @entity3 stars were able to avoid tax on about £ 63million from world tours and cd sales			2
they were among nearly 1,000 people who contributed £ 300million to 62 partnerships			0
but a tax judge found that 51 of the @entity54 investment partnerships , which were formed between 2004 and 2010 , had n’t made any profit at all – despite investing in a range of musicians including @entity125			0
it was also revealed that @entity65 has been trying to shut down the scheme for years			0
@entity2 joined @entity31 on the campaign trail in the run - up to the 2010 general election , backing @entity37 plans for an x-factor - style school singing contest			1
asked if he was supporting the @entity134 , @entity2 replied : ' i would not be here if i was not			2
' the prime minister hosted a @entity80 reception in @entity139 attended by @entity2 in january 2012 @entity2 has spent more than 20 years in the public eye , rising from boyband to some calling him a national treasure			2
he was @entity3 's lead singer when the band was formed in 1989 , alongside @entity51 , @entity145 , @entity52 and @entity146			0
when the band split in 1996 , his solo career was eclipsed by @entity146			0
it was not until the band reformed in 2005 that @entity2 achieved the status of national treasure			2
in 2010 he surprised many by joining @entity31 at a @entity37 party policy launch less than a month before the 2010 general election			1
asked if he was backing the @entity134 , @entity2 replied : ' i would not be here if i was not			2
' he served as a judge on three series of x factor , and confirmed his place in the musical establishment when he organised the @entity163 in june 2012 - which featured a host of stars including @entity166 and sir @entity167 who played to a televised audience of millions			2

his charity work includes gathering a team of celebrities to climb @entity187 in 2009 for @entity188 and organising charity concerts for @entity80 in 2009 and 2011			0
the prime minister added : ' i ’m against these aggressive tax avoidance schemes but i ’m not just against them , this government has taken a huge amount of steps to legislate and toughen the laws and go after aggressive tax avoidance schemes for the very simple reason that if people go after these schemes and aggressively avoid tax they ’re making it the case that everyone else has to pay higher taxes as a result			1
' so i think we should be very clear , tax evasion is illegal and for that you can be prosecuted , you can go to prison for tax evasion			0
' tax avoidance is in these cases , very aggressive tax avoidance schemes , they are wrong and we should really persuade not to do them and that ’s why we have these court cases where the court looks at whether a scheme is really about avoiding tax rather than anything else and the court was very clear in this case			1
' judge @entity225 said : ‘ icebreaker is , and was known by all concerned to be , a tax avoidance scheme			1
' the aim was to secure [ tax ] relief for members , and to inflate the scale of the relief by unnecessary borrowing			0
’ he added : ‘ no serious or moderately sophisticated investor seeking a profit ... would rationally have chosen an @entity239 partnership			0
’ insiders say the judgment on friday took the stars by surprise , and there is speculation @entity3 will have to launch another tour to raise funds			0
there is no suggestion , however , that other band members @entity145 and @entity146 were involved in the scheme			0
last night @entity67 mp @entity40 , who sits on the @entity254 select committee , said the bandmates had no grounds to complain if they were forced to pay back a crippling sum			0

' the people who buy their records pay tax			0
it is unethical to avoid paying what you owe			0
' @entity2 should put a cheque in the post			2

one joked on @entity1 : ‘ @entity2 to swap obe for @entity275			1
’ another said : ‘ did @entity2 “ @entity3 ” too literally ? ’ @entity37 mp @entity277 , who sits on the public accounts committee , said : ‘ this case shows that however famous people are , they must pay their fair share of tax			1
’ @entity283 chief secretary to the treasury @entity284 said : ' people who do n't pay the taxes that they should undermine the economy , damage our public services and place an extra , unfair burden on hard - working families and companies who play by the rules			0
' conservative mp @entity296 told the @entity298 newspaper : ' people who have seriously abused the tax system should be stripped of their honours			0
' the group ’s spokesman declined to comment yesterday – but it was reported that @entity2 believed he ‘ was not given the full picture ’ about the scheme			1
