the full horror of the 9/11 terror attack witnessed by @entity3 gunman @entity2 that could have caused his ptsd has been revealed for the first time by his stepfather			1
in the first interview by a member of the killer 's family , @entity7 , 47 , said his stepson was going up the escalator from the subway station below the @entity15 when the first of the towers collapsed			1
@entity2 joined first responders in desperately trying to save people trapped by the collapsing building in downtown @entity21			1
@entity2 , 34 , who killed 12 people at the @entity3 on monday was present at the @entity15 on sept 11 2001 and helped to pull people from the wreckage he was left so traumatized from pulling bodies from the mangled wreckage that he did not sleep for up to three days afterwards			1
the 12th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attack took place a less than a week ago with memorial services at @entity32 and also at the @entity33 in the @entity34 family members said he suffered from @entity4 and blamed the illness for two violent gun related incidents			1
investigators are looking to @entity4 as a cause for the paranoia and delusions that led him to seek medical help just weeks before going in his deadly rampage killing 12 people			1
@entity7 sits in his car outside his home near @entity49 , @entity50 , as he spoke to @entity51 about his former step - son @entity2 @entity2 called police to his hotel in @entity55 where he said he was being followed and that he heard voices in his head			1
the 34 - year - old 's mental health problems are thought to be the main cause for the rampage at the @entity3 where 12 people were shot dead			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity51 , mr @entity7 fought back tears as he said he is struggling to understand the ‘ loving boy ’ he raised as his own could have become a mass killer			1
he is the only family member to openly speak about @entity2 as investigators try to find a motive for the killing spree			1
‘ what happened in @entity34 was not from the @entity70 knew and loved , ’ he said			2
‘ growing up he was a loving boy			2
he was a kind boy			2
in all the years i was with him there was no hint of any violence			2
’ smoke rising from the burning twin towers of the @entity15 on sept 11 , 2001 : @entity3 gunman @entity2 saw the first tower fall as he emerged from the subway that day @entity7 said @entity2 was working in the it department in a building adjacent to the @entity15 when terrorists launched their murderous attack on september 11 2001			1
mr @entity7 said his stepson was coming up the escalator from the subway station when the first of the towers collapsed			1
he said : ‘ he was on his way to his shift			2
the planes had hit the towers , but @entity2 said he was on the escalator coming up from the subway station when he saw the building come down			1
it was right in front of him , and he said he saw it collapse			0
' the planes had already hit the @entity15 and he was on the subway below the building ' ' that day was traumatic for everyone involved			1
he did not talk much about it , but he said he helped out			0
he was a strong young man so he would have done what he could			0
‘ i also worked at the site , but in another building			0
my shift had ended at 7am and i was already home by the time the planes hit			2
’ the @entity111 of the @entity15 was the first to collapse shortly before 10am on september 11			1
frantic search : emergency responders arrive at the @entity3 in @entity34 , where 12 people were killed and eight injured on monday one of @entity2 ' victims was @entity116 and a candlelight vigil was held in his honor at @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121 on tuesday @entity3 shooting victim @entity116 , 52 the @entity122 collapsed 29 minutes later causing most of the casualties among the fire crews who had been trying to get people out of the burning building			1
@entity2 and his stepfather were living in @entity129 , @entity21 , at the time of the terror attack			1
he said @entity2 was a proud @entity21 and like many people he was affected by the events of that day			1
but @entity7 , who became step dad to @entity2 when he was eight years old , said he did not see any initial signs of @entity4			1
‘ it was a traumatic time , not just for us but all the people in @entity21			2
i ca n't believe that what happened back then was to blame for what went on this week			0
’ one theory that will be probed by investigators in @entity34 is if traumatic memories from 12 years ago played any part in triggering monday 's shooting rampage			2
@entity2 's birth father @entity146 had told police in 2004 that his son was suffering from @entity4 as a result of witnessing the events at @entity32			1
he made his statement to police after his son was arrested in @entity153 for shooting out the tires of a construction worker			2

vigil for the victims : @entity7 , who became step dad to @entity2 when he was eight years old , said he did not see any initial signs of @entity4 in @entity163 after 9/11 chaos : more than 3,000 people work at the site in @entity34 where gunfire erupted on monday he was later involved in another shooting incident while living in @entity170 , @entity171 , when a neighbor complained he had fired a bullet into her floor			1
@entity2 , a former @entity3 aviation technician , did not face prosecution over either incident			1
his clean record enabled him to buy a shotgun used in the @entity3 rampage and also get security clearance as a civilian contractor working in the sprawling @entity3 office complex			2
mr @entity7 said he had not spoken to his stepson since 2007			2
‘ the last time we spoke was when he went off to the @entity3			1
he was so excited to be joining the military			0
‘ i was very close to @entity2 and we had talked about me also joining the military , but i was too old			2
‘ i know he was really looking forward to it			0
he was at my house in @entity190 before he left for boot camp			0
you could see the excitement in his face			0
’ @entity7 said he was part of @entity2 's life from the age of eight until he was in his mid- 20s			1
@entity198 , left , and @entity199 , right , were two of @entity2 ' 12 victims a moment of silence was held during a candlelight vigil at @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity203 , on tuesday in honor of @entity116 who was killed in monday 's shooting at the @entity3 in @entity34 he was married to @entity2 's mother @entity207 for two years but lived with her for a number years before their wedding			1
after their split he stayed in contact with the family , in particular @entity215 , saying he had an ‘ on - off ’ relationship with his mother			2
sitting in his car outside his home in @entity220 , mr @entity7 struggled to comprehend the grief and outrage caused by his son			1
staring down at the floor he had a vacant look on his face as he remembered a ‘ loving and kind boy ’ who loved to play chess			0
‘ what took place the other day is not something that i can ever understand , ’ he said			0
‘ i wish i had the words to explain , but i do n't			0
my thought are not with @entity2 but for the victims			2
my prayers are with their families and i just want to say how sorry i am			0
why would he do this ? ‘ i have not seen or spoken to @entity2 since 2007 but i still ca n't believe that he would do such a thing			2
escape : employees at the naval yard run from the building with their hands in the air following the shooting traumatized from pulling bodies from the mangled wreckage on 9/11 , @entity2 did n't sleep for days afterwards and later developed @entity4 - possibly as a result of what he saw at ground zero ‘ he was not a violent boy			1
the @entity70 knew loved to learn			0
we would watch the @entity257 together			0
he was like a sponge and wanted to learn so much			0
‘ in all the years i was with him i never once witnessed any violence			0
‘ i was his step - father but because i was not that much older than him i was more like a big brother			1
‘ we always got on well and he was never any trouble			0
i just wish i knew what happened to him			0
‘ something changed him because the @entity70 knew was not violent			0
’ mr @entity7 said his stepson 's years in the @entity3 before his discharge in 2011 must have changed him			1
‘ i am hearing all these reports about mental illness , that he had paranoia and heard voices			0
if that is true he should have had help , ’ he said			0
' military veterans should be given the red carpet treatment			0
they should get all the healthcare they need and be helped to get jobs			0
what kind of country are we that a veteran comes back and he has to work in @entity285			0
that is not treating them right			0
’ @entity288 , left , and @entity289 , right , were victims of monday 's massacre salute : defense secretary @entity293 , right , leads a delegation at the @entity295 in @entity34 to remember the victims of monday 's deadly shooting at the @entity3 on tuesday mr @entity7 said @entity2 had two relatives who lived in @entity299 and would often visit them during his breaks from the military			1
‘ he did love @entity299 and its people , but when he went there it was to see his uncle and cousins , ’ he said			2

‘ we just lost contact			0

’ mr @entity7 said he does n't know if he will go to his step son 's funeral			1
‘ that is going to be so hard but it will be up to his family in @entity21			0
