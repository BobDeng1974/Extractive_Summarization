by @entity0 on tuesday , the @entity1 released a warning , titled ' advice for @entity5 students studying abroad : be aware of @entity7			1
' on the webpage containing the advice is included an @entity1 - produced video called ' game of @entity12 ' the video as well as the @entity1 's new effort are in response ot the case of @entity17 , a college student from @entity18 who had studied in @entity19			1
while there , he was courted by @entity19 intelligence officers to provide national defense information to them			2
he received a total of $ 70,000 from 2005 through 2010 for his efforts			0
' @entity43 ' is a nearly 30 - minute dramatic retelling of @entity17 's story			1
in it , he is seen in @entity47 , excited to be studying abroad			0
he responds to a job ad to write political papers in a seemingly innocent job , but which is really a ploy to get him to engage in more sinister activities			0
later , he is seen meeting with a @entity19 woman who then introduces him to a @entity19 man , and @entity17 ends up finding the allure of tens of thousands of dollars to spy for the chinese government an offer too good to pass up			1
@entity17 , the former @entity18 college student who pled guilty in 2011 to charges he attempted to spy for the @entity19 government while studying in @entity47			1
he is serving a four - year sentence in a @entity5 federal prison more than 280,000 @entity5 college students studied abroad last year , according to the @entity64			1
the experience provides them with cultural opportunities , as well as langugage and leadership skills that make them more appealing to both the private sector and the @entity5 government			2
' but this same marketability makes these students tempting and vulnerable targets for recruitment by foreign intelligence officers whose long - term goal is to gain access to sensitive or classified @entity5 information , ' the @entity1 says			1
the @entity1 warns that foreign intelligence officers would never claim they work as such when approaching a student			0
rather , they first develop are relationship under seemingly harmless pretexts , such as an internship , writing assignments or cultural immersion program			0
as the relationship grows , the officer may then ask to provide information , in exchange for money or another type of reward , with the demands growing over time			0
they also suggest that the student apply for @entity5 government jobs when they graduate from college			2
and that 's exactly what happened to @entity17			0
after writing papers , the woman invited the man to meet some of her associates			0
that was when they suggested to have a ' friendship ' and @entity17 start applying for jobs with the federal government in the @entity5 @entity17 ended up applying for jobs at the @entity111 and the @entity112 , the latter as a clandestine service officer			2
he eventually realized the associates were members of the @entity19 intelligence service , but that does n't stop @entity17 from applying			2
a federal agent prepares to arrest college student @entity17 ( played by actor ) in the @entity1 - produced short film ' @entity43 ' the @entity1 advises students to avoid ' money - for - nothing ' offers , as well those that seem too good to be true			1
in addition , students should be skeptical of free favors , such as obtaining visa and work visas while abroad			0
in addition , the @entity1 suggests students minimize information about themselves through social media and not engage in contact with people who are involved with the foreign government or might be involved in criminal activities			1
' a keen awareness is the most powerful weapon [ against being recruited ] , ' @entity17 warns students .			0

effort *spurred* *due* to the case of @entity17 , who attempted to give the @entity19 government classified information while he studied in @entity47
in 2011 , @entity17 pled guilty to charges of attemping to spy for the @entity19 and sentenced to four years in a @entity5 prison
@entity1 made 30 - minute dramatization of @entity17 case called ' game of @entity12 '
the agency advises students to *beware* of foreigners offering them money for *schemes* that appear innocent , but could be a front for other activities
