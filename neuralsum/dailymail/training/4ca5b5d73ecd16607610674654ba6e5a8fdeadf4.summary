a @entity2 woman who claimed to be pregnant with nine babies is not expecting and is simply clinically obese , health officials have said			1
they have also revealed it would be impossible for @entity5 to be carrying nonuplets because her fallopian tubes have been removed			1
the 32 - year - old has also been branded a liar for saying she 'd given birth to triplets just weeks before conceiving her ' new record - breaking brood '			1
@entity13 : @entity14 has been branded a liar by doctors and health officials who say she is nothing but an attention seeker proud father : @entity5 does have three children with mechanic husband @entity22 , but they are four , 12 and 15 - years - old she does have three children with car mechanic husband @entity22 - but they are four , 12 and 15 - years - old			1
doctor @entity23 told @entity24 de @entity25 : ' everything is a crude joke , hatched by a person with an evident and urgent need to say , " here i am ! come and see me ! i exist ! ' ' humanly and scientifically a pregnancy of nine would only be possible through @entity33			1

work station : the garage where @entity5 's mechanic husband @entity43 plies his trade ' this woman needs urgent psychiatric help , because now the hoax has been discovered she will not know how to confront it , how to solve the problem she has created			1
' she will become terribly depressed , which could lead to her hurting herself and , at a given time , could try to commit suicide '			2
while the absence of fallopian tubes does not always prevent pregnancy , @entity53 's claimed lack of @entity33 treatment and the number of babies expected would make it a huge improbability			1
@entity53 stunned the world when , last week , she claimed she was due to give birth on may 20 to six girls and three boys			2
initial doubts were cast after another local doctor came forward and said she recently performed an ultra-sound on and her uterus was empty			2
home : @entity13 , as she has been dubbed , is from the northeastern state of @entity25 , which borders @entity73 but @entity53 , from the north - eastern state of @entity25 , insisted she was being treated for the pregnancy at a hospital in @entity77			2
she told @entity78 : ' it 's very early to think of names for the babies			2
first i hope that everything goes well			2

her children are now being monitored by officials with the @entity106			1
* @entity107 's note - while there is clearly room for debate about the correct grammatical term for a woman who has nine children , the classicists at @entity109 have insisted on using the ordinal @entity117 term , nona , meaning ninth , rather than the cardinal alternative , novem , meaning nine , or indeed the @entity120 , ennea			1
