by @entity0 when @entity2 told me he saw @entity3 as a potential @entity5 leader , i was incredulous			1
it was the party conference of 2007 , and @entity2 — now in @entity7 — wanted something to distract the media from speculation about a possible snap election			2
‘ build up the young guys , ’ he said			2
‘ turn it into a beauty contest about who ’ll take over from me			2
’ i asked him who he wanted me to mention to the media as potential contenders			2
game of thrones : @entity22 keeps @entity23 close at the 2009 @entity24 but secretly favoured @entity3 he reeled off surnames like a football manager naming his line - up : ‘ @entity28			1
’ i replied : ‘ you ’ve already said @entity3			1
’ ‘ both of them , ’ he said			2
‘ really ? ’ i said , surprised			2
‘ you want me to say @entity3 ? ’ @entity2 was adamant : ‘ you need to watch @entity3 , he ’s the one to watch			1
’ i could understand @entity23 being on the list , because the only thing he lacked was confidence in public speaking which — while it was clearly a very big deal — was something he could improve			1
but for all his academic and emotional intelligence , his confidence and good humour , i ’d never seen @entity3 as a potential leader until then			1
first , because i ’d never seen the drive and ambition it ’s now clear he possessed , and second because he ’d have to get past his brother , the guy who used to send him curt emails from @entity7 saying : ‘ get this sorted			2
’ but when i thought about it — more than once when deliberations were going on about a snap election in 2007 , and what that would mean for the timing of the next one — i ’d heard @entity3 say : ‘ i ’d fancy a post-olympics election in 2012			1
’ whether that was ‘ i ’ speaking for the @entity24 , or for himself , or indeed for both , was never quite clear			2
so it was n’t too incongruous to hear @entity2 talking up @entity3 ’s chances			1
then he added : ‘ you know you ’ll have to choose between them one day			0
who will you back ? ’ ‘ i ’m closer to @entity3 , ’ i said , which was undoubtedly true at the time — i did n’t send @entity23 text messages about football or gossip to him about which @entity73 civil servants might have the hots for each other			1
‘ do n’t base it on who you ’re close to , ’ @entity2 said			0
‘ base it on who you believe in			0
’ looking back , i think it was a mistake for @entity2 to say to people that we ’d one day have to choose between the @entity87 people like me who ’d always seen them as indivisible began seeing them as separate entities , and — over time — camps grew up , with the inevitable rivalry , distrust and sniping that followed			0
the team around @entity2 , which had always been remarkable for its unity , suddenly developed fissures			0
the fact that @entity3 zealots later used my sacking as an opportunity to give anonymous and aggressive briefings against @entity23 — despite the damage that would do to @entity2 as well – was a sign of how bad things got			1
it would not have been unreasonable for @entity2 to say — much as the @entity110 ’ mother did during their contest — that he would never take sides between the two eds , or expect his advisers to do so			0
so why did n’t he ? because deep down , he knew one day he ’d probably have to choose himself			0
if @entity115 emerged as a leadership front - runner , determined , as @entity2 would see it , to take the party down routes he had resisted for more than a decade — creeping privatisation of public services , closer integration with @entity123 — he would have to try to stop him			0
that would mean backing the candidate that he felt was best able to set out an alternative , @entity128 vision — and ultimately the candidate most likely to win			0
when that contest materialised almost as exactly as feared in 2010 , @entity2 , however uncomfortable it felt , was forced to pick a favoured candidate between the @entity87 , and use whatever influence he had to try to secure them votes			0
by that stage , i was long gone from @entity137 , but people try everything and everyone when the leadership is on the line			0
that september , rumours began to circulate that @entity23 might cut a late deal with @entity115 , where @entity115 would accept @entity3 ’s position on the pace of deficit reduction and proclaim his attributes as a potential shadow chancellor , in return for which @entity3 would withdraw from the race and urge his supporters to switch allegiance to @entity115			1
my mobile , usually silent those days , started to ring again : @entity2 and others close to him urged me that — if i had any influence over @entity23 or his team — i should tell him he had to reject any deal offered by @entity115 , and instead pursue the same deal with @entity3			1
it would be ‘ madness ’ , they said , if he backed @entity115 to be leader , not ed. i said i was n’t in a position to help even if i wanted to			2
as it was , balls made clear he was n’t interested in any deals , and neither @entity3 brother was inclined to offer one			1
so it came to nothing , but did very clearly expose where @entity2 had his colours nailed			0
and just as @entity3 can very cogently justify why he felt compelled to challenge his brother , i ’m sure @entity2 could equally well explain why he felt obliged privately to back @entity3 over @entity23 , while remaining publicly neutral			1
both saw their decisions as means to the most important end — victory in the battle for the soul of the @entity24			0
that was all that mattered , even if it meant @entity23 limping away from the field feeling just as bruised as @entity115			0
if @entity5 is in power after the 2015 election , either in its own right or in coalition , with @entity3 installed as prime minister and @entity23 as @entity192 , i ’m sure they ’ll invite @entity2 to the first @entity194 , and get him to tell his ‘ @entity197 admiral ’ joke for old time ’s sake			1
perhaps the three will reflect on how far they ’ve come since they first started working together in @entity2 ’s opposition office 21 years before			0
and perhaps they can all shake hands then , and let all the fissures of the past be healed , and every bygone be bygone			0

the key to @entity3 ’s personality is his father			1
indeed , few fathers have influenced their politician sons as much as @entity214 , a refugee from @entity216 - occupied @entity215 who rose to become one of the top academic analysts on modern socialism			0
the policies of @entity5 would probably have appalled @entity214 , who died in 1994 , and his younger son would doubtless have sympathised — though he was in no position to change things			0
now , of course , he is			0
it ’s hard to listen to any of @entity3 ’s occasionally tortured , over-academic speeches without hearing his father ’s voice , especially when he talks about recasting the capitalist model and re-shaping society through the empowerment of ordinary people			1
and that ’s not just about @entity3 ’s politics ; it ’s also undoubtedly central to how he explains to himself and to the rest of his family why he challenged his older brother for the @entity5 leadership			1
inspiration : @entity3 with his father @entity214 in 1989 at home what better reason than needing to achieve his father ’s vision and ensure @entity115 did not traduce it ? an act of supposed disloyalty to his brother becomes transformed in his mind into the ultimate act of tribute to his father			2
at the @entity73 , the two eds were a double act			0
the idea @entity3 was ever made to feel subordinateto @entity23 is baloney , along with the myth of him bringing balls his morning coffee			1
however , @entity3 often found himself acting as confidant for some of the more sensitive treasury ministers and advisers who occasionally felt ignored or dismissed by balls , and it was natural for @entity3 to sympathise and say he knew what they were going through ; it was the same for him			1
whether that was just good management , or artful bolstering of his clique , it worked			0
when the two stood against each other for the @entity5 leadership , it was interesting to watch how many of those who had cried on @entity3 ’s shoulder joined his camp , while the more robust types were firmly with balls			1
but if @entity3 did snipe about @entity23 behind closed doors , it was never reciprocated			2
the first time i ever heard balls say anything remotely negative about @entity3 was at the end of 2008 , when the latter effectively threatened to resign from the @entity289 if a decision was made to build a third runway at @entity292			1
balls was genuinely outraged that @entity3 could ignore the need to expand airport capacity just for the sake of his reputation with the green lobby and his own political positioning			1
he was also angry that @entity2 had been made to look weak in front of his cabinet at a time when he was already so vulnerable , by having to kowtow to a supposed ally			0
a clear subtext to @entity23 ’s irritation that day was seeing his former junior partner so brazenly betraying his political ambitions			0
doubtless @entity115 felt the same way			0
you could see that same irritation again and again during the leadership hustings in 2010 , @entity23 and @entity115 regularly exchanging looks of incredulity when they ’d hear @entity3 distance himself from @entity5 .			2

when @entity22 told @entity0 he saw @entity3 as a intentional leader he did *n't* believe him
the spin *doctor* could understand balls being on the list but never thought of @entity3 until then
