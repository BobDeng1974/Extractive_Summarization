by @entity0 and @entity1 evidence of extraterrestrial clouds covering two of the most common types of planets in our galaxy have been discovered by the @entity10 telescope			0
the atmospheres were discovered by two separate teams of scientists who were analysing the climate of planets @entity16 and @entity18			2
the researchers claim their work is an important milestone in characterising potentially habitable , @entity23 - like worlds beyond the solar system			1
an artist 's impression of the cloudy super-earth exoplanet gj 1214b			0
using the @entity10 , astronomers have determined the planet is shrouded by high - altitude clouds			1
its parent star also raises temperatures to 232 ° c and these weather conditions are expected to last ' for the foreseeable future ' gj 1214b was discovered in 2009 by the @entity37			1
it is roughly 2.7 times larger than the @entity23 and its star lies in the constellation @entity41			2
using the @entity10 to study light filtering through the planet 's atmosphere , @entity43 astronomers determined that the planet gj 1214b is shrouded by high - altitude clouds			1
earlier studies of the planet were not able to tell whether it had clear or cloudy skies but now scientists are confident it is both hot and permanently overcast - a little like @entity55 in our own solar system			1
as was the case with @entity55 until the era of space probes , the cloud cover makes it impossible to know exactly what the planet 's surface is like			0
@entity16 is categorised as a ' warm @entity66 ' because it is much closer to its star than frigid @entity66 is to our sun. the planet is located 36 light - years away in the constellation @entity73			1
gj 1214b , meanwhile , is known as a ' super-earth ' type planet			0
super-earths have masses between that of @entity23 and @entity66			0
because no such planet exists in our solar system , the physical nature of super-earths is largely unknown			1
@entity18 is located just 40 light - years from @entity23 , in the constellation @entity41			1
' both planets are telling us something about the diversity of planet types that occur outside of our own solar system ; in this case we are discovering we may not know them as well as we thought , ' said @entity95 of the @entity96			1
the planets can be observed passing in front of , or transiting , their parent stars			0
this provides an opportunity to study these planets in more detail as starlight filters through their atmospheres			0
for the @entity66 - like @entity16 , the results were more about what the researchers did n't find			2
the light , or spectra , was featureless , revealing no chemical fingerprints in the planet 's atmosphere			1
' either this planet has a high cloud layer obscuring the view , or it has a cloud - free atmosphere that is deficient in hydrogen , which would make it very unlike @entity66 , ' said professor @entity95			1
gj 1214b was discovered in 2009 by the @entity37			0
it is roughly 2.7 times larger than the @entity23 and its star lies in the constellation @entity41			2
it is called a super-earth because it has a mass between that of the @entity23 and @entity66 , pictured			2
exoplanet gj 436b is shown here to demonstrate scale @entity16 is categorised as a ' warm @entity66 ' because it is much closer to its star than frigid @entity66 is to our sun. the planet is located 36 light years away in the constellation @entity73			1
for the @entity66 - like @entity16 , the results were more about what the researchers did n't find			2
the light , or spectra , was featureless , revealing no chemical fingerprints in the planet 's atmosphere			1
' either this planet has a high cloud layer obscuring the view , or it has a cloud - free atmosphere that is deficient in hydrogen , ' said @entity95 of the @entity96			1
instead of hydrogen , it could have relatively large amounts of heavier molecules which would compress the atmosphere and make it hard to detect any chemical signature			0
' instead of hydrogen , it could have relatively large amounts of heavier molecules such as water vapor , carbon monoxide , and carbon dioxide , which would compress the atmosphere and make it hard for us to detect any chemical signatures			0
' observations similar to those obtained for @entity16 had been previously obtained for gj 1214b			0
the first spectra of this planet were also featureless and presented a similar puzzle : the planet 's atmosphere either was predominantly water vapour or hydrogen - dominated with high - altitude clouds @entity18 , whose star lies in the constellation @entity41 , is roughly 2.7 times larger than the @entity23			1
what its clouds are made of is still unknown , but computer simulations suggest they could be composed of potassium chloride or zinc sulphide dust			0
dr @entity182 , leader of the @entity184 astronomers , said : ' i think it ’s very exciting that we can use a telescope like @entity10 that was never designed with this in mind , do these kinds of observations with such exquisite precision , and really nail down some property of a small planet orbiting a distant star			0
' the observations took around 96 hours spread over 11 months - the longest period ever devoted to studying a single exoplanet with the space telescope			0
dr @entity182 's team analysed near - infrared light from the planet each time it passed in front of , or ' transited ' , its star , an event that occurs every 38 hours			2
@entity10 's high - performance @entity208 is one of few capable of peering into the atmospheres of exoplanets many trillions of miles away follow - up observations suggested that the planet ’s atmosphere was either mostly composed of water vapour or dominated by hydrogen with high - altitude clouds			1
the new study ruled out a cloud - free atmosphere of water , methane , nitrogen , carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide			0
a ' flat ' signal from the @entity10 data , lacking chemical fingerprints , indicated the presence of high altitude clouds of uncertain composition shielding what lay beneath			1
the @entity43 space agency @entity237 's 6.5 metre @entity236 , due to be placed in orbit later this decade , is expected to reveal more information about exoplanet atmospheres			0
' looking forward , @entity236 will be transformative , ' said graduate student @entity241 , another member of the @entity184 team			0
' the new capabilities of this telescope will allow us to peer through the clouds on planets like @entity18			0
but more than that , it may open the door to studies of @entity23 - like planets around nearby stars			2

super-earth @entity18 orbits a star situated 40 light - years from @entity23
it is shrouded by clouds and its star raises it temperature to around 232 ° c
@entity16 atmosphere , 36 light years away , has no chemical fingerprints
this could be because the planet has a high cloud layer obscuring the view
the work is an important milestone to characterising potentially habitable , @entity23 - like worlds beyond the solar system
