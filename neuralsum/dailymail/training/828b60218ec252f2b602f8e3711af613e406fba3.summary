published : 04:20 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 04:24 est , 23 may 2013 a 3d reconstruction of a tooth : by measuring the relative amounts of barium and calcium on a tooth 's growth lines , shown here in colours , scientists showed that a @entity12 infant probably switched to a solid diet after around 14 months neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans , according to new research			1
chemical analysis of a juvenile 's tooth reveal it was reared on mother 's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same period coupled with solid food			1
the change from breastfeeding to plants and grains can be established by looking at differences in the distribution of barium in teeth enamel			2
this enabled dr @entity34 and colleagues at @entity36 in @entity37 to discover the early life diet of a 10 - 12 year - old child that lived in a cave in @entity43 around 100,000 years ago			1
weaning is critical to developmental and reproductive rates			0
later weaning can have health benefits while doing it earlier leads to shorter intervals between births which influences population growth , evolution and success			0
the change from breastfeeding to plants and grains can be established by looking at differences in the distribution of barium in teeth enamel			0
the researchers said our understanding of the evolution of human weaning has been limited by a lack of reliable markers to indicate the timing and nature of dietary transitions			1
barium distributions in tooth enamel accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother 's milk through to feeding with other food sources , the team said			1
experiments on humans and macaques revealed barium rises during breastfeeding and drops abruptly on weaning			0
the study of a molar tooth of the @entity12 child uncovered barium levels indicating it was breastfed exclusively for seven months followed by seven months of supplementation after which breastfeeding was ceased			1
barium levels in the teeth of this @entity90 child suggest that it was partly weaned at 227 days after birth and entirely weaned at 435 days @entity93 is calcium 's cousin , and it goes where calcium goes in the body			1
over the years , it accumulates in our bones			1
when a mother begins nursing , some of that barium migrates into her breast milk , and eventually , into her baby 's teeth			0
this allowed the team to track when mothers stopped breastfeeding			0
dr @entity34 , assistant professor of dentistry at @entity36 in @entity37 , said : ' here we show large dietary shifts in early life manifest as compositional variations in dental tissues			0
' teeth from human children and captive macaques , with prospectively recorded diet histories , demonstrate barium distributions accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother 's milk through the weaning process			0
' we also document dietary transitions in a @entity12 , which shows a pattern of exclusive breastfeeding for seven months , followed by seven months of supplementation			1
' after this point barium levels in enamel returned to baseline prenatal levels , indicating an abrupt cessation of breastfeeding at 1.2 years of age			2
' neanderthals lived during the last @entity139 and would have had to have coped with extremely harsh environments			2
while blizzards raged outside the parents would have to track down something to eat , prepare it and keep the fires going			0
examination of @entity12 burial sites and caves have led researchers to conclude they were not ' savages ' but lived in small nuclear families			1
there was also some amount of social networking including interaction between family or neighbouring groups			0
and they went well beyond their capacity to fend for themselves meaning they took care of their elderly and sick - as well as their children			2
patterns of barium in baby teeth reveal the duration of breast - feeding - here , the different stages are shown they grieved at the loss of an infant or elder by burying their dead			2
it is also believed they were able to produce speech and may even have been responsible for some of the most ancient cave art on the planet			2
dr @entity34 said : ' in the @entity12 the protracted weaning process typical in primates was interrupted by unknown causes precipitating abrupt cessation of suckling			0
' the period of exclusive breastfeeding in this @entity12 is consistent with other hominoids ; human hunter - gatherers and wild chimpanzees also begin to supplement milk with solid food by around 6 months of age			1
' humans and chimpanzees may wean offspring as early as 1.0 and 4.2 years , respectively , withoutserious health effects , but average 2.3 - 2.6 years and 5.3 years			1
' he said the study will help further studies into theories @entity12 young routinely weaned at later ages than later early humans or possessed faster life histories than modern man which have important implications for models of population growth and species replacement .			0

researchers analysed tooth of a 10 - 12 year - old child that lived in a cave in @entity43 around 100,000 years ago
found it was breastfed exclusively for seven months followed by seven months of supplementation
