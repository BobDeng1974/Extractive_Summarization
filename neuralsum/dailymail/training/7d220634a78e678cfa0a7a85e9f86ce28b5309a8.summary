some of the pioneers are now grandparents , passing on their skills and enthusiasm to the next generation			0
' lots of people thought that like chopper bikes and @entity150 the fad would soon pass , but as we can see in @entity7 alone , where there are at least 75 skateparks currently in use , skateboarding is still as cool as ever , and has received a real boost thanks to the growing number of @entity159 bikers , who now shares the facilities at most skateparks			0
