the @entity0 came face - to - face with millions of portraits of herself today , as she visited a stamp factory in @entity4			1
during the visit to @entity6 , she was shown printing machines , as well as a stamp archive			0
but @entity0 , who was making her first visit to @entity4 since 1994 , certainly did n't appear to mind and beamed as she was shown around the plant in the @entity13 's i54 business park			1
joined by the @entity14 for the visit , the @entity0 , who was resplendent in a colourful turquoise ensemble , looked delighted by her welcome , smiling as she spotted a large crowd of well - wishers outside			2
but the royal couple could n't stay long and were whisked off for their second engagement of the day at the city 's brand new @entity58 factory which was recently completed at a cost of £ 500m and will create up to 1,400 jobs in the area			1
@entity0 , who formally opened the plant , toured the factory and was introduced to an excited group of local school children before being treated to a private lunch with the directors and the @entity14			2
how very kind : the @entity0 looked thrilled as she was handed a bouquet on her way out of the stamp factory big arrival : the @entity0 's first stop was at @entity6 at @entity4 's i54 business centre @entity74 to be back : both the @entity0 and the @entity14 were on cheerful form as they arrived in @entity4 thrilled : international security printers managing director @entity76 looks utterly delighted as he 's introduced to the queen wonderful day : fellow managing director @entity78 looks delighted as the monarch beams at him while shaking his hand paying attention : the @entity0 looks on intently along with @entity76 as the finer points of quality control are explained so that 's how it 's done : the @entity0 comes face - to - face with thousands of her portraits as she watches a stamp cutting machine at work although declared officially open today , the @entity58 plant will not start full production until early 2015 - but has caused much excitement among locals and is the first new factory that the company has built from the ground up			1
the facility will manufacture a new family of engines called @entity100 - the first engines to be entirely designed and built in - house by @entity58 for exclusive use in the company ’s future vehicles			0
the queen is herself a fan of @entity58 's vehicles and has often been photographed driving around the @entity108 in @entity109 in a @entity58			0
inner workings : the @entity0 looks on , clearly enjoying the visit , as she is shown a stamp cutting and finishing machine impressive stuff : the @entity0 and @entity14 are given a closer look at some of the enormous stamp printing machines important : the @entity0 opened the new @entity58 factory which is expected to bring up to 1,400 new jobs to the area interested : prince @entity14 has long had an interest in science and technology and , like the @entity0 , is regularly seen in his @entity58 wonderful : the @entity0 beamed broadly as she was met by flag - waving school children at the @entity58 plant did you do that ? the @entity14 looks impressed as he chats to an excited group of school children at the @entity58 plant top form : the @entity14 certainly appeared to enjoy his visit to @entity4 - his first since 1994 technology : the new factory will produce innovative new engines that will be used exclusively in @entity58 cars clever : the @entity0 has the new engine parts explained to her by @entity58 chief executive dr @entity141 but she has had little time for peaceful drives in recent weeks , thanks to a heavy schedule that included a reception for @entity148 and @entity149 holders at @entity150 on tuesday and a meeting with the emir of @entity153 yesterday			1
the visit to @entity4 also marks the first time she has ventured outside @entity156 since returning from her annual summer holiday at @entity108 in september and her first visit to the @entity159 for two years - the last being during the @entity161 tour			2
it is not the first time the @entity159 city has enjoyed a royal visit from a reigning queen , however			2
in 1866 , queen @entity148 visited the city and was driven through the city in an open landau to @entity169 ( now called @entity4 ) , where she unveiled a statue of @entity171			2
so impressed was the monarch with the event and the enthusiasm of the crowds , she stopped to knight the mayor , a man named @entity178 , once the unveiling ceremony was complete			0
interest : prince @entity14 , who has long had an interest in technology , is shown engine parts by director of manufacturing @entity184 impressive : the brand new factory will begin production early next year , creating up to 1,400 jobs in @entity4 interested : the royal couple listened to company executives speak about the positive impact the factory is expected to have big opening : after officially opening the new factory , the @entity0 signed the visitor 's book as the @entity14 looked on it has been named the fifth worst city in the world and was dubbed the least happy place to live in the @entity159 , so why on @entity200 would the @entity0 want to pay a visit to @entity4 ? the answer is because it 's brilliant			1
today , for instance , the monarch is set to open a new @entity58 plant			0
not only has her visit gotten locals talking , it ’s set to create 1,400 jobs			1
those who hail from @entity4 like myself will know this is the best news we ’ve had since @entity215 got promoted to the @entity216 and local lad @entity217 ( the one from the @entity159 who is n’t @entity219 ) landed a spot in @entity221			0
and @entity4 has plenty to offer the queen too			0
my advice ? stop by the @entity225 to hear the dulcet tones of @entity227 , pop in at @entity229 ’s hairdresser @entity228 for a perm and round off the day with a curry at @entity232 ( the only @entity234 rated restaurant we have to offer )			0
it might look grey from the outside but those of us who live there and love it know that @entity4 really is one of the best cities in the world			0
@entity156 patriotic : the queen and the @entity14 were greeted by flag waving crowds of well - wishers as they made their entrance big job : the @entity0 and the @entity14 were making their first trip outside of @entity156 since returning from @entity108 last month she 's here ! locals in @entity4 spoke of their excitement ahead of the @entity0 's visit - her first to the city since 1994 looking good : for the visit , the @entity0 opted for an elegant turquoise ensemble paired with one of her trademark @entity262 bags royal approval : her majesty is the second reigning queen to visit the city , which enjoyed a visit from @entity0 @entity148 in 1866			1

the @entity0 visited the @entity159 city of @entity4 accompanied by the @entity14
she was all smiles during the visit to the city which last year was named among the least happy in the @entity35
with prince @entity14 , she also visited the @entity6 plant in @entity4 's i54 business park
afterwards , she was driven to the new £ 500m @entity58 plant for its official opening
the plant , which will produce engines , is expected to create up to 1,400 new jobs for local *people*
