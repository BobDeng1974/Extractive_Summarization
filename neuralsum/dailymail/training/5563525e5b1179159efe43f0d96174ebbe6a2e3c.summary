the number of people losing their lives to malaria has halved since 2000 , but experts warn the progress made in @entity6 is in jeopardy as resources and funds are channeled into fighting @entity10			1
fragile gains against malaria in the region have been hampered by the @entity10 outbreak , which has so far claimed the lives of more than 6,300 people			2
in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 malaria programmes have been suspended in some areas while resources are directed into battling the deadly virus			1
and the epidemic has put a huge strain on already fragile health services in the three countries , hit hardest by the worst @entity10 outbreak in history			2
the @entity30 's director general @entity29 , said : ' the collapse of health systems has affected all core malaria interventions and is threatening to reverse recent gains			1
fatalities decreased 53 per cent in children under the age of five - the equivalent of averting around 3.9 million children 's deaths			0
in @entity59 , where 90 per cent of all malaria deaths occur , the mortality rate fell by 54 per cent - 58 per cent in under fives , the equivalent of around 3.9 million children 's deaths averted , the @entity30 annual report revealed			1
but @entity30 experts have warned of major gaps in access to mosquito nets and anti-malaria treatments			1
and the @entity69 agency said there is a ' worrying ' emergency of resistance to the most commonly used insecticides			2
the @entity30 said the number of infections in @entity59 at any one time fell 26 per cent during the 13 - year period			2
meanwhile , 13 of the 97 malarial countries reported no cases of the disease last year , including two , @entity81 and @entity82 , which recorded their first ever zero results			0
' these are truly unprecedented results and phenomenal news in terms of global health , ' said @entity89 , director of the @entity30 's global malaria programme			1
he attributed the progress in large part to increasing financial and political commitment , in particular regional efforts to work together to eliminate malaria			0
however , despite a threefold increase in investment since 2005 , malaria programmes are still underfunded - $ 2.7 billion ( 2.2 billion euros ) in 2013 , compared to $ 5.1 billion international target			1
malaria programmes have been suspended in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 - the three nations worst hit by the current @entity10 epidemic , which has so far claimed more than 6,300 lives and people suffering malaria in the @entity10 - ravaged region are reluctant to visit hospital or seek medical help over fears of contracting the deadly virus and as a result , major gaps remain			1
while access to insecticide - treated bed nets has improved , 278 million of the 840 million people at risk in @entity59 still live in households without one			0
as many as 15 million pregnant women do not receive any preventative treatment , while 437,000 african children are still dying from the disease each year			0
in @entity6 , since the outbreak of the current @entity10 epidemic earlier this year , the focus has shifted from fighting malaria to containing the deadly virus			1
health workers had been increasingly using simple tests to diagnose malaria on the spot , to better target treatments			2
but these have been suspended in areas rife with @entity10			2
and many people suffering malaria are staying away from clinics			0
@entity134 , lead author of the @entity30 's malaria report said if people ' are n't getting treated , you can be sure that mortality is going to increase			0
the total death toll from malaria across the three countries was expected to be about 20,000 a year before the outbreak			0
mr @entity134 said he would not predict a figure now			0
more than 6 , 300 people have died from @entity10 in the region in the past year			0
aside from the direct consequences , the resurgence of malaria could also harm the fight against @entity10 because the two have similar symptoms , making it difficult to diagnose the deadly virus , the @entity30 said			1
across the world malaria deaths fell 47 per cent over the 13 - year period			1
but the @entity30 has warned of major gaps in access to mosquito nets , anti-malarial treatment and a ' worrying ' resistance to insecticides @entity162 last week launched a campaign to provide anti-malarial drugs to 2.4 million people in @entity18 , while global aid agency @entity166 is conducting a smaller scale effort in @entity20			1
another issue threatening progress on malaria across the world is the rise of insecticide resistance , which has been reported in 49 countries since 2010 - 39 of which reported resistance to two or more insecticide classes			0
' emerging drug - and insecticide - resistance continues to pose a major threat , and if left unaddressed , could trigger an upsurge in deaths , ' dr @entity178 added .			0

worldwide malaria deaths fell 47 per cent between 2000 and 2013
but @entity30 warned recent gains could be reversed as resources and funds are *diverted* to help fight the @entity10 epidemic
in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 malaria programmes are suspended
@entity30 director general @entity29 , said the collapse of health systems in @entity6 is ' threatening to reverse recent gains ' against malaria
who warned of major gaps in access to mosquito nets and treatments
and said there is a ' worrying ' emergence of resistance to insecticides
