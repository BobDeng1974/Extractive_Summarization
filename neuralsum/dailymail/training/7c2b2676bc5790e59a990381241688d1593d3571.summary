forget soap and water - these days , women are ditching flannels in favour of electric face brushes to help give skin a super-deep clean			1
first on the scene , in 2009 , was the £ 150 @entity8 , but since then the market has exploded			1
now , every major skincare brand , from @entity11 to @entity12 , has their own			1
last month , budget store @entity13 announced a £ 9.99 version - including a year 's worth of replacement heads ( most manufacturers suggest replacing heads every three months , or when bristles become worn )			1
while features vary , broadly speaking , there are two technologies : vibrating and rotating			1
there 's no independent research to suggest one technology is superior , and most experts agree that , in general , all face brushes can be good for skin			1
' used correctly , they can help remove more surface dirt than manual cleansing , meaning the products you use penetrate better			1
' devotees claim they leave skin more toned and radiant , but dr @entity38 warns they need to be used with care : ' there is the potential for over-cleansing , damaging the skin , and they can even cause breakouts			1
it 's about using it when your skin needs it , with an appropriate cleanser , such as @entity60 , that wo n't over-dry your skin			1
' so , with dr @entity38 ’s help , we compared some of the newest electric face brushes on the market , costing from under £ 10 to £ 155 ... @entity8 sophisticated technology : the @entity8 £ 155 , clarisonic.co.uk heads included : one			1
replacements cost from £ 35 for two			1
a range of types , including deep - pore cleansing , are available			1
how it works : the market leader ( with price to match ) , it oscillates 300 times a second			1
the timer has a one - minute cycle , which beeps at 20 , 40 and 50 seconds to remind you to change area , and a two - minute cycle			2
fully charged ( via the magnetic usb charger ) , it lasts around 28 minutes			2
verdict : @entity8 brushes have the most sophisticated technology and their claims are supported by most research			1
this latest brush feels like a premium product : weighty and substantial			2
that said , i think you 're paying for a brand name			2
i 'm not convinced it cleans three times better than its £ 50 lookalike			1
' i like the timer function , ’ says dr @entity38			2
‘ it ’s very precise and anything that mitigates a tendency for overuse is a good thing , though i ’m not convinced anyone needs to be using anything other than the gentlest head			2
’ @entity112 5 in 1 @entity113 and @entity114 from £ 6.08 , @entity115 heads included : one brush , one sponge , one latex , one pumice , one massager			1
how it works : a battery - powered brush head rotating in one direction			2
@entity87 ? no. verdict : this felt cheap			2
the bristles were scratchy , the head wobbled and the other heads felt either ineffective , or downright dangerous			2
' lots of women are inclined to equate that squeaky - clean feeling with taking care of their skin when , actually , it can indicate that you 've damaged the skin 's barrier function , ' says dr @entity38			1
' the heads with this gadget mean there ’s potential for abuse : some look more suited to woodwork than skincare			2
' @entity148 £ 79 , clinique.co.uk heads included : one			1
how it works : this two - tone brush vibrates rather than rotates			2
@entity148 advises using the soft , white bristles on the cheeks for 15 seconds , and the firm , green bristles on the t - zone for 15 seconds			2
a built - in timer stops movement after 30 seconds			2
it charges via a stand with a usb cable , and a full charge lasts 180 minutes			2
verdict : for the price , this did n't deliver			2
the design was unimpressive and the stand is n't waterproof , so you ca n’t keep it in the bathroom			2
basically , it vibrates - the whole unit , not just the head			2
' i 'm not convinced that different bristles are necessary , ' says dr @entity38			0
' you 're not getting into the pores , just removing the top layer of make - up and dead skin cells			0
this did n't seem to have much cleaning power			0
i do n’t think you ’ll do any harm with it , but it ’s not the best out there			0
' cheaper choice : @entity191 claim their product works as well as the @entity8 @entity194 £ 20 , @entity115 heads included : one			1
replacements cost £ 9.99 for two			1
how it works : battery - powered brush head rotates up to 350 times a minute			0
no timer , but @entity191 advises moving it around the face for one minute			1
verdict : when @entity191 launched this brush in the @entity206 , it claimed its study showed it cleaned as effectively as the @entity8			0
@entity8 later disputed the manner in which the tests had been conducted			0
however , @entity191 is the only budget brand publishing any research			0
if you want to use it with your regular cleanser ( it 's sold with @entity191 's own ) , search @entity191 ( the name for @entity191 in @entity218 ) on @entity115 and buy the brush alone for around £ 17			1
' a waterproof model at this end of the budget is a definite plus point , ' says dr @entity38			0
' i 'd like a timer , but it ’s a good option			0
' @entity227 £ 9.99 , @entity13 heads included : three			1
replacements cost £ 7.50 for two , including shipping from @entity218			1
how it works : battery - powered brush with two modes : spinning and oscillating			0
@entity87 ? no. verdict : this wo n't win any prizes for looks , and the bristles splayed so easily , i ca n't imagine they 'd last the four months they claim			0
not the best budget option			0
' the distinction between the two modes - rotating , for a gentle cleanse , and oscillating , for a thorough cleanse - is pointless , ' says dr @entity38			0
' with no timer , people could be more inclined to use it for too long			0
' budget buy : @entity13 's version is just £ 9.99 and the bristles splayed easily @entity252 £ 49.99 , lookfantastic.com heads included : one			1
replacement heads cost £ 15.99 for two			1
a sensitive version and one for the body are available			1
how it works : uses a pulsing - or vibrating - technology , charges via a magnetic system and , fully charged , lasts around 28 minutes			0
@entity252 recommends using for 20 seconds each on the forehead , nose and chin , and ten seconds on each cheek			0
it beeps every 20 seconds and stops after one minute			0
verdict : although the design and magnetic charger look like the @entity8 , this is smaller and lighter , and moves only 10,000 times a minute , compared with the @entity8 's 18,000			0
without evidence that twice the movements makes for twice as good cleansing , i thought it a decent alternative			0
however , dr @entity38 was n’t impressed : ‘ i ’m really concerned about their claim that this can stimulate collagen production			0
' i do n't think you should be using cleansing to do that , and telling people they should be using it twice a day to get this result could tempt women with wrinkles and delicate skin to overuse it , upsetting the barrier function of the skin , and causing more damage			1
' @entity294 £ 19.50 , marksandspencer.com heads included : one			1
replacement heads cost £ 6			1
how it works : a battery - powered brush that spins in one direction			0
no timer , but the manufacturer advises moving across the face in gentle movements for between 30 seconds and a minute			1
@entity87 ? no. verdict : the brush was soft but , as with all rotating brushes , i felt it dragged the skin round the eyes more than the vibrating brushes			1
' this is a good budget option , ' says dr @entity38 , ' but not being able to use it in the shower marks it down			0
although they advise a time limit , without a built - in timer , it would be too easy to overuse			0
' expensive option : @entity321 is £ 150 @entity321 £ 150 , philips.co.uk heads included : two ( one normal , one sensitive )			1
a range of replacements , including an exfoliating one , start at £ 8 for one			1
how it works : a brush with two speeds that rotates in one direction while vibrating			0
@entity329 suggests cleansing the t - zone and both cheeks for 20 seconds each			0
it pauses every 20 seconds and turns off after a minute			0
the charger plugs into a storage cradle : a full charge lasts 30 minutes			0
verdict : this is comfortable , but looks odd and is easy to turn off accidentally			0
it 's the most expensive rotating brush here and the only rechargeable ( rather than battery - powered ) one			0
i like it , but i think you pay for the design and stand			0
' their research shows it cleanses ten times better than manual cleansing , ' says dr @entity38			0
' the timer will prevent overuse			0
as with any brush , i 'd recommend gradually introducing it to your regime , and less use in winter			0
