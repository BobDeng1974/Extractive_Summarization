by @entity1 reporter published : 12:14 est , 24 november 2012 updated : 04:32 est , 26 november 2012 while some may say never work with children or animals , photographer @entity2 decided to ignore this pearl of wisdom			1
the snapper wanted to work with something ' a little less predictable ' and certainly achieved that , by bringing in hungry wild animals and taking their portrait			1
mr @entity2 brought in hungry mountain lions , cheetahs and orangutans , who were trained not to attack humans , and using their favourite types of food managed to take their photograph in a studio by rewarding them with snacks			1
the photographer based in @entity48 , @entity49 , said the most difficult part was ' pre-production ' of his ambitious idea			0
he said : ' trying to find the animals i could bring into the studio , find the right trainers to come with these animals , and even just to find a space that could contain an elephant , contain a giraffe - and that was a big part of it			2
' once he had the animals he needed , he signed large insurance policies and liability contracts so , if an animal died during a shoot , mr @entity2 owed $ 500,000 , the website reported			2
he says , technically , the animals are considered trained , although ' not trained in the sense that a dog is trained ... they are basically trained to not come out on to the set and try to attack you ; beyond that , they are really going to do what they want to do			2
' he would allow them to sit on the set - sometimes while held by their trainer - and then inch up until he managed to take the perfect picture of them			0
he said despite the chaos around the situation , he aimed to find the perfect moment where he captured the animal			0
the photographer wanted to achieve a sense of isolation with his wild subjects , he told the website			0
the images - entitled @entity96 - were the stunning results of his work , giving a close up view more normally gleaned from zoom lenses in the wild - all from a 90 Ã— 120 - foot sound stage in a @entity104 studio lot			0
for price and availability of prints , please contact @entity109 i 'm ready ! the animals were brought in so the photographer could try and capture their portrait the photographer got up and close personal with the animals , which have been trained not to attack who are you looking at ? the photographer managed to get the unique shots after bringing the creatures into his studio and rewarding them with food beauty : the stark beauty of the arctic fox is captured against the black background - in a studio lot in @entity104 made a mistake ? this chimpanzee clutches his head , looking as if he 's just remembered something			1

@entity2 captured the wild animals portraits by offering them snacks as he inched towards them
animals are trained not to attack and are normally used in films
