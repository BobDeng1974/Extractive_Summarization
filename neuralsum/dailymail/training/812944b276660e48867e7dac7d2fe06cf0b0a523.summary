by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 18 may 2012 updated : 10:22 est , 18 may 2012 flying over the skies of @entity5 in southwest @entity2 , the @entity2 's latest stealth plane - the @entity3 - is a testament to @entity2 's growing prowess in military technology			1
the debut flight of the plane may serve as a warning to the @entity12 air force , which has been plagued by a list of problems in their jets - including the revelation that some of their jets have a faulty oxygen system which have slowly been poisoning their pilots			2
sightings of the black plane taking off have again led to claims that the plane was developed off the back of stolen @entity12 or @entity27 plans , a claim strongly denied by @entity2			1
the @entity2 j - 20 stealth fighters take too the air for test runs : the planes mark @entity2 's entry as the third nation to have stealth technology vehind the @entity12 and @entity27 see anything familiar ? the f - 22 raptor has similar canted tail - fins , a similar bubble canopy and nose section , and both have no flat surfaces to help avoid radar detection @entity44 claims that the current batch of @entity12 fighter jets are struggling due to labour disputes , cost over-runs , and lethal design flaws			1
first off , the @entity12 's @entity51 ’s @entity50 - the latest stealth fighter which cost $ 66.7 billion to develop - have been poisoning its pilots owing to a faulty oxygen system			1
meanwhile , workers at @entity51 ’s f - 35 factory have gone on strike , with no end in sight			0
the @entity59 has also been delayed by several years due to design costs - and the delay means that the cost of building thousands of new jets has risen by hundreds of billions of dollars			2
@entity2 originally claimed the @entity3 would not be ready until 2017 at the earliest , and the @entity12 , countered and said it would likely be 2020 or later			2
however , the test flight shows how close to completion the first models are , and @entity44 points out that @entity2 eschews the @entity12 system of carefully testing new jets over a decade			1
instead , @entity2 holds preliminary tests and then passes the jets over to the military , and reply on feedback to improve the next generation			0
the @entity12 tried to emulate this model with the f - 35 - but encountered design flaws which ended up costing the military billions of dollars			0
@entity44 said the @entity2 were using imported @entity27 engines to power the the @entity3 , and said this could lead to future issues and delays in rolling out the stealth jets			2
and @entity27 makes three : the @entity84 jet was built to rival the @entity12 stealth programme last year @entity2 was caught in an international row after the @entity12 charged and jailed @entity88 @entity87 , a former b - 2 stealth bomber engineer , for leaking secrets to @entity2			1
he was jailed for 32 years			0
and when the @entity3 was unveiled , other nations - incredulous how quickly the @entity2 has developed and tested the stealth fighter aircraft - said the technology must have been stolen			1
one of the more extraordinary claims was that it had gained invaluable information from parts of an @entity12 @entity98 stealth bomber that had been shot down over @entity99 during the @entity100 – the only @entity98 ever shot down			0
the @entity2 insist that the country 's j - 20 stealth fighter jet was the work of the country 's own designers and engineers			1
an unnamed official was quoted as saying : ' it 's not the first time foreign media has smeared newly unveiled @entity2 military technologies			0
it 's meaningless to respond to such a speculation			0
' @entity2 pilot @entity113 said that the @entity3 possesses an advanced supersonic cruise ability and powerful air mobility that are technological breakthroughs for the country			0
he added it would have been impossible for @entity2 to glean technology from the @entity98 as the ' outdated ' technology was behind the current generation of fighters .			0

@entity2 's first stealth plane *spotted* on test runs , making @entity2 one of three nations with stealth jet technology
*critics* claim this is a rip - off of @entity12 's f - 22 jets , which cost $ *66.7billion* to develop
