after months of testing , leaked screenshots and videos , @entity0 has officially announced its @entity4 in the car service goes live this week			2
called @entity7 , the integrated system gives drivers a ' smarter , safer and more fun way to use an @entity10 in the car			1
' it works by linking the car 's built - in display and software with @entity17 and @entity18 on the @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity13 - and will be rolled out to compatible @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 later this week			1
researchers from @entity27 recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while driving - on software including @entity0 's @entity18 - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers in april last year @entity32 researchers found that using voice commands to send text messages while driving - on software such as @entity0 's @entity18 - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers			1
they found that both methods impacted driver response times equally - but that it often took voice recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages			0
the findings were then confirmed by the @entity42 in the @entity43 in june			0
it similarly found that as mental workload and distractions increase , reaction times get slower and brain function is compromised			0
in the run up to the @entity7 release , @entity0 added eyes - free technology to its latest @entity17 software			1
the @entity54 - free tool lets users control this the system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road			2
once an @entity10 is connected to a vehicle fitted with @entity7 , @entity18 can be used to access the phone ’s contacts , make calls , return missed calls and listen to voicemails			1
when a user receives an incoming message or notification , they can reply using voice commands			0
@entity18 can also read the messages and let drivers dictate longer responses or emails			0
while driving , @entity7 can guess destinations by scanning the phone ’s calendar for appointments , and when used with @entity81 , @entity18 will give instructions , warn of any traffic incidents and keep the driver updated with the estimated time of arrival			2
drivers can also ask @entity18 for turn - by - turn directions , which are shown on the car ’s built - in display			2
elsewhere , @entity7 can be used to control music , podcasts and audiobooks on the car ’s display , or by asking @entity18 to pull up what they ’d like to hear			2
@entity7 also works with select third - party apps such as @entity97 and @entity98			1
drivers ' brainwaves were monitored while they talked on the phone and while voice - activated emails were played to them , in a system similar to that used in @entity0 's @entity7 , pictured			1
talking on a phone resulted in a moderate risk , but listening to voice - activated features was classed as an extensive risk elsewhere , @entity7 can be used to control music , podcasts and audiobooks on the car 's display , pictured , or by asking @entity18 to pull up what they 'd like to hear			1
@entity7 also works with select third - party apps such as @entity97 and @entity98 ‘ @entity7 has been designed from the ground up to provide drivers with an incredible experience using their @entity10 in the car , ’ said @entity113 , @entity0 ’s vice president of @entity10 and @entity114			1
‘ @entity10 users always want their content at their fingertips and @entity7 lets drivers use their @entity10 in the car with minimised distraction			1
we have an amazing lineup of auto partners rolling out @entity7 , and we ’re thrilled it will make its debut this week			2
’ a leaked video , posted by app developer @entity129 at the end of january , hinted to what the technology would look like			0
@entity129 shared screenshots , like the one pictured , about what @entity7 might look like other car makers including @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 will be shipping @entity7 - compatible cars later this year			1
a leaked video , posted by app developer @entity129 at the end of january , hinted to what the technology would look like			0
@entity129 shared a series of screenshots about what @entity7 might look like			0
@entity158 has also been in talks with car manufacturers , including @entity161 , to add a similar , @entity163 - based system into cars later this year			1
commenting on the news , @entity165 , ceo of @entity166 said : ' there 's an all out war for identity on the web and @entity0 has taken a first step towards entering the fray			0
' the internet of things is now clearly becoming a part of consumers ’ everyday lives , and while @entity0 ’s extension to the driver ’s seat is a positive sign , @entity0 would benefit in many more ways if it opened up @entity184 as an identity provider across devices and platforms			0
' having @entity0 @entity184 in our cars is a great initial step , but the ' internet of things ' will continue to be a throng of siloed devices until these gadgets can talk to one another through identity			0
for @entity0 , there 's a much broader , and more lucrative market to address in identity			0

integrated system works by linking a smart car 's display with an *iphone*
the files and apps of the @entity10 are then shown on the display of the car
called @entity7 , it is compatible with the @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity13 running @entity17
it will be rolled out to @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 *customers* this week
other car makers including @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142 will be shipping @entity7 - compatible cars later this year
