by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 9 december 2013 a mother of two who lets her children stay at home says they do n't need to go to school because they learn enough ' naturally ' by playing computer games and going for walks outside			1
@entity8 , 32 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , is one of a new wave of parents embracing ' unschooling ' , a new philosophy that rejects traditional , curriculum - based , education in favour of letting children choose what they want to do			1
rather than sitting down with a workbook and learning key subjects such as maths or @entity22 , miss @entity24 ' daughter @entity25 , nine , and son @entity26 , eight , enjoy playing @entity27 on their laptops , baking or going to the shops with their mother			1
but she says her children are learning ' naturally ' by playing on their own and having ' life experiences ' like cooking or playing in the park			1
she said : ' school is not necessarily the best environment to learn in and when it came to my children i wanted to give them the choice to stay at home			1
' and they 've not been held back by that - they can both read and write very well , and they 're just as advanced as children their age who go to school			2
' they pick things up every day and that 's how they learn			2
i do n't think it 's right to introduce projects and make them sit down to learn something			2
' if i tried to do that , they 'd be confused			0
' miss @entity8 , who lives with her registered disabled partner , @entity75 , and their two children , says she does n't believe in routines or schedules , so there are no set meal times and the children go to bed when their parents do , which can be between 9pm and midnight			1
miss @entity8 , who left school with no qualifications , has been told she is too uneducated to teach her children unschoolers believe that children 's innate curiosity will drive them to learn , so a curriculum is n't necessary and while children across the country are sitting down to the desks for the day 's lessons , @entity25 and @entity26 are engrossed in their favourite computer game , @entity27 , or collecting feathers and stones in the nearby country park			1
their mother said : ' both the kids have learnt numbers , words and how to type through their computer games , and they 've learnt a lot about computers too			2
' they 've learnt maths through things like shopping and baking			2
' numbers are always going through @entity26 's head - he 's fascinated with clocks and timetables			1
@entity25 is more of a words person - she learnt through games like @entity118 and @entity119			1
' they 've learnt about birds , trees and rocks just by being outdoors			0
' miss @entity8 says if her children ask her a question she does n't know the answer to , they look it up together daughter @entity25 , nine , went to primary school for eight days last year but stopped going because she did n't like it she added : ' they 're naturally curious and ask a lot of questions , which i try my best to answer			1
if i ca n't , we 'll look it up on the computer or we 'll find someone who can help			0
' miss @entity8 , who left school without any qualifications and did a variety of jobs including working on a market stall before having children , dismisses people who have told her she 's ' not educated enough ' to educated her children			1
she said : ' i have been criticised for what we 're doing and some ca n't believe it 's legal			0
' a lot of people find it hard because people have been going to school for centuries and we 're going against that			0
' we have a great deal of quality time together and it 's made us closer as a family			2
it makes me very sad when i hear parents say they ca n't wait for their children to go to school so they can have some peace and quiet			2
' why have children if you do n't want them around ? ' the children can read and write as well as or better than their peers in formal education , their mother says miss @entity8 ' children both attended nursery school five days a week but when @entity25 was four , her mother heard about unschooling and decided to give her children the choice			1
she said : ' i decided to ask the kids what they wanted to do about school			0
' i said their friends were going but it would be stricter than home and they 'd have to sit for longer periods of time at their desks			2
i also explained they would n't get days off when they wanted			0
' they both decided they wanted to be at home with their mum			0
' she said @entity25 attended primary school for eight days last year but decided it was n't for her			1
' she told me she really wanted to try it so we took her out and bought the uniform and the bag , ' she said			0
' she went to bed early , set her alarm and got herself up in the morning			0
' @entity25 went to school for eight days last year so we took her out and bought the uniform and the bag but she did n't like it in the end			1
' - @entity37 , mother ' none of the children could believe she had never been to school before			1
' she added : ' @entity25 did n't like it in the end			1
she found some things very frustrating - she was much more advanced than other kids in her swimming classes but was n't allowed to go in to the deep end of the pool			0
the teachers did n't really know how able she was			0
' she was also taught nursery rhymes like ' @entity218 ' which she found babyish			0
miss @entity8 is not concerned about her children 's prospects , saying she is bringing them up to be ' free - thinking '			1
she said : ' i 'm bringing the kids up to be free - thinking entrepreneurs who do n't have to work for someone else if they do n't want to and do n't feel they have to ' be something ' when they grow up			0
' today leading educators said a formal education offered children the best chance			1
dr @entity237 , of the @entity238 ’ @entity236 , said : ' it ’s important that we do have an element of choice within our education system , and one size will never fit all , but for the vast majority of children a school environment , with a formal curriculum and experienced teachers , is by far the best option			2
' it ’s not just the content of a formal curriculum that ’s important , it ’s also about how you learn and the life skills and attributes you develop while in education			2
' part of a rounded education , for example , is the ability to develop ‘ critical thinking ’ and to question assumptions you have grown up with , which can only truly happen outside of the home environment			0
' it is also much easier to learn skills like ‘ collaboration ’ when you are actually working alongside a group of classmates each day			0
' no lessons : miss @entity8 says her son and daughter have learnt words by playing @entity118 with her and @entity276 , headmistress of @entity277 in @entity278 , near @entity279 , said : ' schools provide an environment where there can be exciting stimuli , opportunity and support for an adolescent to safely learn and develop their thinking and personalities			1
' teenagers are very creative and , as we all do , benefit from working with those who are more experienced and experts in their subject area alongside their peers			0
' young people need to know how to filter and shown discernment in their processing of information , and it is very difficult to develop this sort of mindset in a vacuum			0
' - @entity276 , headmistress of @entity306 's , @entity278 ' research shows that a teenager ’s brain demands interaction with other teenagers and will seek it out if it is not there			0
in the age of information overload , young people need to know how to filter and show discernment in their processing of information , and it is very difficult to develop this sort of mindset in a vacuum			0
' the unconventional phenomenon of unschooling began in @entity323 but its popularity is now on the rise here in the @entity327 , and miss @entity8 knows a community of around 200 other parents in @entity10 who embrace unschooling or other variations of education that reject formal schooling			1
while home - schooling your children is legal , the legality of unschooling is unclear , with the @entity339 ( @entity340 ) saying that children of compulsory school - age must receive a suitable full - time education , whether in school or otherwise			1
a spokesman for the @entity340 said : ' parents in @entity347 must ensure that children of compulsory school age receive a full - time education ' suitable ' for their age and abilities			0
' this can be at home or at school			0
it is down to local authorities to decide whether the education a child is receiving is suitable			0
' a @entity359 spokesperson said : ' the @entity359 is supportive of parents ’ right to home school if they wish			0
' local authorities , however , have a duty to ensure that parents that are known to be home educating are providing their children with a suitable education			2
' a spokesman for @entity369 , which covers the area the @entity8 family lives in , said they could n't comment on individuals but said they were ' committed to providing the highest quality educational experiences for all children and young people '			1
he added : ' there is a very small number of parents who choose to home educate their children and the authority has a responsibility to monitor this provision to ensure that the needs of the children and young people are met			1
