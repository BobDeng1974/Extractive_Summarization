by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 27 september 2013 archaeologists have discovered a leopard trap used by hunters 5,000 - years - ago in @entity4			1
@entity4 researchers originally thought the trap , which was found in the @entity7 , was just a few hundred years old , as almost identical devices were used by @entity9 living in the region in the last century			1
scientists believe the type of trap , which to non-experts might look like a pile of stones , was used to catch carnivores , possibly by people living in the area who first kept herds of goats and sheep			2
@entity4 researchers originally thought the trap ( pictured ) , which was found in the @entity7 , was just a few hundred years old			1
archaeologists believe it could have been used to catch carnivores since people living in the area first kept herds of goats and sheep @entity30 , a geochronologist with the @entity31 of @entity4 , said : ' the most exciting thing is the antiquity of these carnivore traps , which is totally unexpected			1
' the trap was found alongside a younger , 1,600 - year - old construction and the findings published in the journal @entity39			2
there are thought to be at least 50 similar traps in the @entity7 , which merge into the rocky landscape , @entity40 reported			1
dr @entity30 said : ' they look like a pile of stones , like a cairn , and you need a good eye and also some digging around to realise what it is			0
' the trap from the ' closed side ' in the desert			0
it works by a person attaching a piece of meat to the end of a rope to entice a leopard into the stoney box , tripping the heavy door shut and trapping the animal inside the basic trap works by a person attaching a piece of meat to the end of a rope to entice a leopard into the stoney box , tripping the heavy door shut and trapping the fierce animal inside			0
there is a deliberate opening on one side of the trap and large slabs of stone form the roof of the chamber , which is around 60 centimetres high			0
the archaeologists optically dated the most recently discovered traps and compared the amount of radiation absorbed over the millennia to determine their ages			2
the age range of the traps , that were 5,000 and 1,600 year 's old , suggests that the method of trapping the animal has been used for thousands of years and must be fairly effective			2
scientists believe no leopards live in the @entity7 now as habitat loss decimated their populations			0
the last one was spotted around a decade ago both were found near sites of ancient enclosures use by early goat and sheep herders living 6,000 - years - ago who were presumably concerned with protecting their flocks			1
the site is close to the @entity102 , where numerous @entity104 and @entity105 sites were found			0
it is thought the traps also managed to entice other predators living in the @entity109 , including wolves , hyenas and long - eared cats			1

the trap , found in the @entity7 , was originally believed to be a few hundred years old , suggesting the design has not *changed* much
