officers removed six guns from @entity4 ’s home amid concerns for his mental health after he threatened to shoot himself			1
but he successfully applied for their return simply by denying that he had ever felt suicidal			0
yesterday @entity20 said the decision on removing guns should not be left solely to the discretion of a police officer and must involve a health professional as well as checks with the owner ’s partner			2
@entity4 , 42 , shot his partner @entity29 , 47 , her sister @entity30 , 44 , and niece @entity31 , 24 , shortly after returning home from a pub late on @entity10			1
detective superintendent @entity34 said @entity4 and his partner of 19 years had gone out separately and ‘ an argument took place ’ on their return to the semi-detached house in @entity41 , @entity9 , @entity42			1
he said : ‘ mr @entity4 produced a shotgun and in a matter of moments shot dead @entity29 , @entity31 and @entity30 before turning the gun on himself			1
’ the women ’s bodies were found in the kitchen and living room and a shotgun was by @entity4 ’s side			1
the killer ’s stepdaughter @entity54 , 19 , was slightly wounded and escaped from the house by climbing out of a first - floor window			1
friends said the once ‘ happy - go - lucky ’ family man had been depressed about a heart @entity61 , 74 , said both @entity62 and mrs @entity29 were ‘ very good neighbours ’			1
she added : ‘ i could n’t say anything bad about either of them			0
he was a happy - go - lucky person and very well liked			2
‘ i just do n’t know what happened to him			0
he must have snapped somehow			0
she died alongside her daughter @entity31 , right , who at 24 was the youngest of the three killed in the @entity10 tragedy @entity4 was a keen angler before taking up game shooting several years ago			1
@entity83 , a friend who runs a fishing tackle shop , said mrs @entity29 phoned her last year to ask for advice because @entity4 was refusing to get treatment for a heart problem			1
mrs @entity83 ’s husband , @entity88 , died three years ago from a heart attack			0
‘ she was really worried about @entity90 , she was on about his heart and the fact that he was n’t doing anything about it , ’ she said			0
‘ he was a very friendly chap on the outside but i do n’t know what he was like between the four walls of his house			0
laughing killer : @entity4 at an awards evening in 2005			2
he was a keen angler and took up shooting several years ago ‘ he had suffered from depression for quite a while , i think			0
i do n’t know if that ’s got something to do with this			0
they were both hot - headed but very nice people			2
’ police have referred themselves to the @entity108 over the decision to return three licensed shotguns and three ‘ high - powered ’ firearms , believed to be rifles , after @entity4 threatened to shoot himself in 2008			1
@entity113 , @entity114 mp for @entity115 , said : ‘ at the time the police took his firearms from him and he applied to have them returned			2
police made an assessment and they were returned to him			2
’ @entity107 confirmed that the weapons were taken from mr @entity4 ’s house as a precaution , but as he insisted there had been no threat to harm himself , the weapons were returned			1
shot at close range : @entity29 , circled bottom right , the partner of gunman @entity4 , was killed in the massacre ; the identities of her friends in this image is not known that decision followed national procedure , a force spokesman said			1
‘ it was one person ’s word against another , ’ he said			0
‘ if there were no grounds for applying for the revocation of a firearms licence the guns would be returned to the firearms licence holder			0
’ commenting on firearms regulations , mr @entity113 said : ‘ at the moment it is fairly subjective – the police are responsible for carrying out an assessment of whether an individual is a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence			2
‘ my view is there should be some input from a suitably qualified health care professional			0
secondly , i also wonder whether it is reasonable to keep firearms in a domestic situation			0
’ @entity159 , chairman of the @entity161 select committee , said the law ‘ should be simplified , clarified and made consistent ’			0
escape : @entity54 , pictured at her 18th birthday party , was shot during the incident but managed to escape by climbing through a window desperate : drenched in blood and hysterical , @entity54 , pictured , pounded on the door of a neighbour 's house he said it would be ‘ appropriate ’ for the government to look at gun laws in @entity174 where the partners of gun licence applicants are contacted in advance of a licence being issued			1
