' raheem on his skills ' i do keepy - uppies literally every day on the training field but i do n't do as many skills as i used to do when i was younger			2
i used to have 10 yards of space and no - one around me and used to do six or seven stepovers , but there 's no point if you 're not putting the ball in the back of the net			2

most people have started aged 7 , 8 , 9 or 10 and some make it to the last important step and some do n't , so it 's really [ a ] make or break [ situation ] initially that we 're in			0
' we work for it from a young age and people do n't see it until we 're in the public eye , so they 're probably just thinking that we 're born into playing football really , but it 's a journey we 've come on			0
' we do put hours in off the field as well and try to give back as much as possible as we do on the field			2

' yeah , i 've heard that quite a few times			0
' raheem on ignoring the hype ' it 's nice to hear the things people say but i do n't really take it in too much			0
i just try to block it out and concentrate purely on football , to improve and try to make people talk even more			0
' raheem on his unique running style ' none of them [ team - mates ] have gotten to me yet about that , but we always have a joke and a laugh about different stuff			0
i have n't been bantered so much about that , i 've more had that on social networks			0
