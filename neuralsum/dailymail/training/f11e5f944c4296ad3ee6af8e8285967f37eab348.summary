by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 18:45 est , 29 november 2012 police conducted themselves with ' integrity ' at all times during the original phone hacking investigation , @entity1 ruled police conducted themselves with ‘ integrity ’ at all times during the original phone hacking investigation , @entity1 ruled			1
in the months of fevered speculation leading up to the inquiry being called , officers had been accused of turning a blind eye to the industrial scale of the phone - hacking carried out by @entity15 journalists			1
the @entity17 force was accused in the @entity18 and elsewhere of not investigating properly because of its closeness to @entity21 , owner of the now defunct @entity23			2
@entity1 said a ‘ series of poor decisions , poorly executed ’ had contributed to this idea taking hold			1
but , crucially , he said there was no reason to doubt the integrity of the police and senior officers concerned			0
he accepted the force ’s argument that it had been under huge pressure to devote resources to thwarting terrorist attacks at the time the original decision was taken in 2006			1
@entity39 had been attacked by terrorists in july 2005 and a transatlantic bomb plot was being investigated in one of the biggest operations in modern times			0
police launched the original hacking investigation , dubbed @entity47 , after members of the @entity49 contacted them with concerns that their voicemails were hacked by the @entity52 in december 2005			2
the newspaper ’s former royal editor @entity53 and private investigator @entity55 were jailed in 2007 for hacking			2
in the months of fevered speculation leading up to the inquiry being called , officers had been accused of turning a blind eye to the industrial scale of the phone - hacking carried out by @entity15 journalists @entity63 , former assistant commissioner at the @entity17 , resigned in july 2011 over criticism of his review two years previously but police later came under fire for failing to widen the scope of the investigation despite evidence suggesting that there were many more victims , including celebrities and senior politicians			1
@entity63 , former assistant commissioner at the @entity17 , was said to have decided in a matter of hours that there was no fresh material which could lead to convictions			0
he resigned in july 2011 over criticism of his review two years previously			0
@entity1 said that mr @entity63 – a friend of @entity79 , then deputy editor of the newspaper – should have made sure he was not involved			2
the @entity52 's former royal editor @entity53 ( left ) and private investigator @entity55 ( right ) were jailed in 2007 for hacking the report by @entity86 ( above ) acknowledged that the decision to restrict the original investigation was justified , given the pressures of counter-terrorism activities at the time but the judge added : ‘ in reality , i am satisfied that i have seen no basis for challenging at any stage the integrity of the police , or that of the senior police officers concerned			1
‘ what is , however , equally clear is that a series of poor decisions , poorly executed , all came together to contribute to the perception that i have recognised			1
’ the report acknowledged that the decision to restrict the original investigation was justified , given the pressures of counter-terrorism activities at the time			1
but it added that the ‘ very experienced ’ assistant commissioner @entity63 should have reflected on whether he should be involved in an investigation into the newspaper at which he had friends , including one who was the deputy editor			2
‘ he would have been better advised to arrange for a different officer to conduct it , ’ the report said			2
‘ that is even more so when he decided , within hours and before the case papers had been recovered and could be properly reviewed , that there were no grounds for reviewing the decision : errors of recollection were inevitable and they were made			0
‘ furthermore , publicly to announce that conclusion , on camera , on the same day meant that there was no turning back			0
a defensive mindset was then established which affected all that followed			0
’ but the report concluded : ‘ the mistakes were neither more nor less than that : the integrity of the officers who gave evidence and were directly involved in the investigation shone through what they said and i do not doubt it			1
’ @entity39 had been attacked by terrorists in july 2005 ( above ) and a transatlantic bomb plot was being investigated in one of the biggest operations in modern times - putting the police under huge pressure @entity147 : voicemail messages were probably deleted automatically @entity15 was n't to blame for @entity150 ' false hope ' moment the @entity15 did not give ‘ false hope ’ to @entity147 ’s parents by deleting messages on her mobile phone , @entity1 accepts in his report			1
the toxic claim – made by the @entity18 newspaper – was the direct trigger for the prime minister establishing the inquiry in july last year			0
but the report accepts that this did not happen and that the voicemail messages were probably deleted automatically by the mobile network operator			0
during their evidence , @entity166 and @entity167 spoke movingly of the moment in march 2002 when they realised that messages on their missing daughter ’s phone had been deleted			0
this became known as the ‘ false hope moment ’ because it led them to believe that @entity150 was alive			0
several months after making its claim , the @entity18 accepted that journalists from the @entity15 – by now defunct – had not deleted the messages			1
@entity1 says in his report : ‘ i entirely reject the suggestions that this error has undermined the basis for the inquiry which , in the light of all the evidence i have heard , was and remains more than amply justified			2
‘ whereas it is true that a definitive conclusion is not possible on the existing state of the evidence , and may never be , the inquiry does conclude on the lower standard of proof of the balance of probabilities that tampering with or illegal interception of @entity147 ’s voicemail was not the cause of the “ false hope moment ”			0
‘ this resulted from nothing less banal than the automatic deletion of messages in the ordinary course of the workings of the system			0
’ the @entity15 did not give ' false hope ' to @entity147 's parents ( pictured yesterday ) by deleting messages on her mobile phone , @entity1 accepts in his report			1
