by @entity0 the @entity1 of its orbit			2
on thursday , the @entity8 astronauts raised the altitude of the @entity1 by half a mile ( 0.8km ) to prevent a gravity - style disaster			1
@entity11 said the astronauts fired 53 thrusters at on the @entity1 ’ @entity14 for three minutes , 40 seconds to complete the manoeuvre			2
the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) was forced to dodge a deadly field of space junk last week after debris came within 1,000 feet ( 0.3km ) of its orbit this was enough to prevent the space station from colliding with parts of an old @entity23 rocket which was launched by the @entity24			1
this is the second time in less than three weeks that the @entity1 has had to sidestep space junk			1
@entity11 spokesman @entity27 said the space agency has had to consider sidestepping space junk dozens of times since the outpost was launched in 1998 , sometimes cancelling the orbital dodge at the last moment			1
on thursday , the @entity8 astronauts raised the altitude of the @entity1 by half a mile ( 0.8km ) to prevent a gravity - style disaster			1
in the film in ' gravity ' two astronauts are left drifting in the void after a collision between satellite debris and their spacecraft since the first object , @entity44 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris			1
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			2
it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity68 's orbit , travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph			1
one major source of debris in the past was the testing of anti-satellite weapons carried out by both the @entity75 and @entity76 in the 1960s and 1970s			0
accidental events have also contributed to the problem			0
in february 2007 for instance , a @entity82 @entity81 booster stage exploded in orbit over @entity85			0
more recently , the @entity87 satellite , also known as the ‘ @entity88 of space ’ , made a fiery fall to @entity68 in november last year			2
the station also moved on march 16 this year to avoid an old @entity82 weather satellite part			0
and the problem is only set to get work			0
last year , @entity11 said the amount of space junk orbiting @entity68 has reached a tipping point			1
this junk – which can include anything from old rockets , abandoned satellites to missile shrapnel - will soon make it difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet , the space agency claims			2
there are currently around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			2
overall , it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity68 's orbit , travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph			1
as well as this , there are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they ca n’t be tracked			2
even tiny paint flecks can damage a spacecraft when travelling at these velocities			0
a number of space shuttle windows have had to be replaced because of damage caused by material that was analysed and shown to be paint flecks			0
‘ the greatest risk to space missions comes from non-trackable debris , ’ said @entity135 , @entity11 chief scientist for orbital debris			0
since the space age began 54 years ago , civilisation has littered the area just above @entity68 's atmosphere with leftover boosters and other parts that come off during launches , as well as old satellites			1
many pieces of space junk fall back down to @entity68 , but most burn up on re-entry			1

in february 2007 for instance , a @entity82 @entity81 booster stage exploded in orbit over @entity85			0
the booster had been carrying an @entity172 - @entity171 communication satellite but malfunctioned before it could use all of its propellant creating a cloud of space debris			0
based on a data archive , each miniature sphere in this image represents an existing object orbiting in space			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track more recently , the @entity87 satellite , also known as the ‘ @entity88 of space ’ , made a fiery fall to @entity68 in november last year			1
its debris fell along a path through @entity192 and the @entity193 to @entity194 but no one was hurt			0
several solutions to retrieving or moving the space junk have been put forward including giant cosmic versions of harpoons , nets , tethers , magnets and even a giant dish or umbrella - shaped device			2
@entity205 also has the option of taking additional precautions , such as closing hatches between some of the station ’s modules , if the likelihood of a collision is great enough			0
the debris field was created by parts of an old @entity23 rocket launched by @entity217			1

@entity1 altitude was raised by half a mile ( 0.8km ) to avoid *dangerous* collision
debris field was created by parts of an old @entity23 rocket launched by @entity217
is second time in less than 3 weeks that @entity1 has had to sidestep debris
