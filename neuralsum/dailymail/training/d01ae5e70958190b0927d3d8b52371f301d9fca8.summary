by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has vowed to make an impact at @entity4 this season and silence the critics who claim his £ 22million move from @entity8 last summer was a waste of money			1
@entity2 , 24 , made only two @entity11 starts due to a succession of niggling injuries that frustrated his new club and manager @entity15			1
there were even suggestions the gifted @entity20 forward ’s issues might be psychological rather than physical or that he was suffering from homesickness			1
‘ no it was n’t mental , ’ he said			2
‘ mentally i do n’t know where i was , but the most important thing in football is the head			2
there are so many good players but your head has to be right			2
‘ in that moment , people were saying “ @entity2 is not good and they paid £ 20m ” but i was quiet , i kept working and i knew i would show what i was capable of			1
if you want a good player you have to pay for them			0
‘ i was n’t happy , that was obvious			0
but i never said it was better to leave @entity51			0
i know i ’m good , i know i can play there			0
it was difficult but in that moment you just have to believe in yourself			0
‘ i spoke with the manager a bit about that when we came back			0
i have his confidence and i ’m going to do everything i can to repay that and show i deserve to play			0
’ despite a lack of match action last season , @entity2 still demonstrated his potential by scoring six goals in 18 appearances in all competitions			1
with @entity69 ruled out for up to two months with a broken bone in his foot and @entity72 struggling for fitness after the @entity74 , @entity4 will be relying on @entity2 for goals when they kick off the new campaign against @entity77 in the @entity78 a week on sunday			1
battle : @entity2 vies for the ball with @entity26 's @entity81 highlight : @entity2 's goal against @entity83 in the @entity84 was a rare bright moment for him last season the former @entity88 star is ready for the challenge this time , blaming last season ’s setbacks on the fact that his protracted move to @entity51 meant that he did not have a proper pre-season			1
‘ the problem was that the club had finished with the first part of pre-season in @entity101 and i was waiting to sign , ’ said @entity2 , who is set to face @entity95 at @entity96 tomorrow ( wed )			1
‘ i was working alone but it ’s not the same			0
‘ when i arrived they were starting to play matches and i was always behind the rest of the squad			0
then i had one injury after another			2
‘ in the last few months of the season , when i was fit , i played well every game			2
i came on for 30 or 45 minutes , some games i started			0
this year hopefully when i have a good preparation with the team it ’s going to be a different story and they will see the real @entity2			1
