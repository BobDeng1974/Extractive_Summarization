the toddler 's immune system was so badly damaged after cancer treatment that she could not mix with other children and spent hours alone with only her pet for company			2
but after a course of successful treatment , the one year old is finally looking forward to playing with friends in her new garden , which has been transformed by a charity makeover			1
toddler @entity3 , from @entity19 , had been forced to play in isolation away from other children after her immune system was damaged while undergoing chemotherapy for cancer doctors said she could not mix with other children and the little girls spent hours alone with only her dog @entity5 for company doctors discovered that the little girl was suffering from a rare cancer just weeks after she was born and the one year old had to undergo gruelling chemotherapy sessions			1
the treatment damaged her immune system which meant she had to be kept apart from other children to stop her catching their germs			0
she played alone in the family 's back garden at @entity39 , with just her dog @entity5 for company			0
after months , her chemotherapy sessions have ended , and the one - year - old has had immunisation jabs to protect her			0
now a charity - funded makeover has transformed the drab area into a safe and colourful place where she can play with her new friends			1
@entity50 , @entity51 , 32 , said : ' after her treatment , @entity52 was so vulnerable to infection we could barely take her outside , it was a nightmare			2
' she could n't spend time with other children and her life was very limited			0
her best friend was her dog , @entity5			0
but she has now received her immunisation jabs and can finally play with other children in her new garden , which recently received a charity - funded makeover from its drab original condition doctors discovered that the little girl was suffering from a rare cancer just weeks after she was born and the one year old had to undergo gruelling chemotherapy sessions ' now we have a beautiful garden and she is so much better - seeing her play there with other children is lovely to watch			1
it 's a blessing as we 're having a lovely summer , she 's out there constantly			0
@entity52 is blooming - and so is the garden			0
last month , @entity79 and @entity80 , a children 's cancer charity , paid to turn the area , which was filled with rocks and bare soil , into a lovely , lawned haven with outdoor toys for the toddler			2
a swing will also soon arrive for @entity90 , courtesy of the @entity93 fund , a charity which helps youngsters with childhood cancer			0
mrs @entity3 and her husband @entity97 , 32 , a technical adviser , were distraught when they learnt their new - born baby had @entity100 , a rare type of cancer found in the vulva and needed lengthy chemotherapy treatment			1
@entity50 , @entity51 , 32 , said her daughter was so vulnerable to infection after treatment they could barely take her outside the garden was once home to rocks and shrubbery and was difficult for the little girl to play in she said : ' she lost her hair and was very sick , all the usual things you would expect			1
you do n't expect children to recover when they are diagnosed with rare forms of cancer but she seems to have beaten it and i am beyond relieved , you ca n't find the words to describe how it feels			1
' although it will be some time before she is given the all clear , we have been told the cancer cells are dormant			0
' it was heartbreaking when we first started taking her to playgroup sessions , as she was so used to playing on her own she carried on doing just that and would n't interact with other kids			0
' having a safe place for her to play means so much to us , it 's a lovely garden and now she does n't have to enjoy it alone , she is playing happily with her friends			1
' mrs @entity3 , who also has a six - week - old son @entity135 , added : ' we plan to celebrate @entity52 's second birthday party in the garden if the sun shines			2

@entity3 diagnosed with a rare type of cancer shortly after birth
treatment left her open to infection and she was unable to play with friends
but little girl is looking forward to playing in new garden thanks to charity
she is now on road to recovery and has been immunised against infection
