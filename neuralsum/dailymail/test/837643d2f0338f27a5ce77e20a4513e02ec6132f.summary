while sunseekers across @entity3 have been making the most of the clear skies recently to soak up some sunshine , the lack of clouds has also proved a bonus for stargazers in @entity9 hoping to catch sight of shooting stars			0
this incredible image was captured above @entity13 in @entity14 yesterday as photographer @entity15 picked up two meteors which were part of the @entity19 meteor shower			1
the annual celestial event has been observed for the last 2,700 years across the globe , but is most visible in the northern hemisphere , and is expected to peak tonight with between 10 and 20 meteors an hour			1
the lyrids are created by debris from @entity41 , which takes about 415 years to orbit around the @entity43 , and appear to radiate outwards from a star known as @entity45 and the constellation @entity47 in which it sits - which gives the meteors their name			0
mr @entity15 , a 50 - year - old meteorologist , said : ' i was out photographing the sky and saw the meteor , which was amazing			0
' while the @entity19 shower has been known to produce up to 100 meteors sightings per hour , most years the peak , which occurs tonight , only produces between five and 20 per hour ( the @entity19 shower pictured from space )			2

lyrid meteor display is visible in skies across the globe every year in april , and has been observed for 2,700 years
number of meteors is *unpredictable* , usually peaking at around five to 20 an hour , but has reached 100 per hour
@entity15 captured this image of meteors passing through the skies over @entity13 in @entity14 yesterday
