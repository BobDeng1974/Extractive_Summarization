by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:33 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 15:09 est , 11 march 2014 the head of the @entity5 has accused the @entity6 of spying on their internal computer network during their searches about how the agency used torture during @entity14 - era terror investigations			1
the shocking allegations were made by @entity17 senator @entity16 , who publicly aired her grievances on the @entity5 floor on tuesday			1
@entity6 director @entity20 has since denied the claims during an interview later that day , but he did n’t shy away from complaining about senator @entity16 ’s behavior			1
airing her grievances : @entity5 chair senator @entity16 accused the @entity6 of improperly searching a network of computers designed for @entity29 @entity20 said the agency was not trying to stop the committee 's report and that it had not hacked into @entity5 computers			1
he said the appropriate authorities would look at the matter further and ‘ i defer to them to determine whether or not there was any violation of law or principle			0
’ @entity16 said the matter has been referred to the @entity42 for further investigation			2
she said she had ‘ grave concerns that the @entity6 's search may well have violated the separation of powers principles embodied in the @entity48			2
’ the @entity6 provided computers to congressional staffers in a secure room in northern @entity52 in 2009 so the panel could review millions of pages of top secret documents in the course of its investigation into the @entity6 's detentions and interrogations during the @entity14 administration			2
at issue now is whether the @entity6 violated an agreement made with the @entity5 about monitoring the panel 's use of @entity6 computers			2
when asked about the ongoing battle of he - said , she - said , the @entity67 sided with the @entity6 but did not expand into details			2
' @entity67 ’s perspective on this is reflected in the fact that we support the declassification of the findings of the report , ' @entity72 said at a tuesday afternoon press conference			0
@entity16 said the @entity5 staff members had an electronic search tool to deal with 6.2 million pages of documents and the ability to make copies on their computers			2
she said the arrangement suffered a blow when @entity6 personnel electronically removed the committee 's access to documents that had already been provided to the panel			0
denial : @entity6 director @entity20 said that the agency ' was in no way spying ' on the @entity29 committee in question or the @entity5 she said about 870 documents were removed in february 2010 , and an additional 50 were withdrawn without the knowledge of the committee			1
@entity16 said she has asked the agency for an apology but the @entity6 has been silent			1
director @entity20 , who first told @entity16 about the surveillance of the @entity5 investigation that occurred before he took over the @entity6 , had no immediate comment on the senator 's statement			1
the dispute comes as the @entity111 administration is trying to regain public trust after classified details about widespread surveillance of @entity115 were disclosed by former @entity117 systems analyst @entity116 last summer			0
this dispute does not involve the @entity117 spying on @entity115 , but it does show a fractious relationship between the @entity115 spy agencies and the @entity29 charged with overseeing them			0
@entity16 , as head of the @entity124 panel , has defended the @entity117 against criticism of its practices , making her comments about the @entity6 dispute highly unusual			1
senators said the stakes demanded it			0
public stage : senator @entity16 spoke about the alleged searches of the materials on the use of torture during the @entity14 administration on the @entity5 floor tuesday after having two prior private requests ignored ‘ if we do not stand up for the protection of the separation of powers and our ability to do oversight , especially when conduct has happened that is all likelihood criminal conduct on the part of a government agency , then what do we stand for ? ’ asked @entity142 ’s @entity17 senator @entity141 , the chairman of the @entity143			1
saying she wanted to set the record straight amid various published reports and rampant speculation , @entity16 said the @entity6 searched the computer network in january and she had pressed @entity20 about the agency 's actions and the legal basis for its search			1
she said she had not received any answers despite letters sent on january 17 and january 23			0
@entity16 said the @entity6 's inspector general , @entity165 , has referred the matter to the @entity42 ‘ given the possibility of a criminal violation by @entity6 personnel			1
’ in further evidence of the escalating fight , @entity16 said that after the inspector general 's referral , the acting counsel of the @entity6 filed a criminal report with the @entity42 regarding the committee staff 's actions			1
@entity16 defended the staff as professionals with appropriate security clearances			0
supporting the senator : @entity143 chairman senator @entity141 agreed with @entity16 , who claimed the @entity6 's searches undermined the separation of powers under the @entity48 ‘ i view the acting counsel general 's referral as a potential effort to intimidate this staff , and i am not taking it lightly , ’ she said			1
@entity20 , who was questioned at an appearance on another subject , said ‘ we are not in any way , shape or form trying to thwart this report			0
’ ‘ i am confident that the authorities will deal with this appropriately , ’ he said			0
‘ i would just encourage some members of the @entity5 to take their time , to make sure they do n't overstate what they claim and what they apparently believe to be the truth			0
’ democrats on the @entity5 completed their 6,300 - page interrogation report last year and are revising it with @entity6 comments			0
@entity16 said she would ask the @entity67 to declassify its 300 - plus - page executive summary , and its conclusions			0
when the report was first approved by @entity17 on the committee in december 2012 , @entity16 said her staffers came to the conclusion that the detention and interrogation program yielded little or no significant intelligence .			0
