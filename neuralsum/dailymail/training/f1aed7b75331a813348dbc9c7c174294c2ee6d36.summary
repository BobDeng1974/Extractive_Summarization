a giant 45 foot cannon so powerful it could launch satellites into space has been revealed by a @entity4 inventor			1
@entity5 hopes his design , which has a specially developed bore than continually increases the speed of the satellite			1
@entity10 believes it could even lead to giant cannons 150 feet long to launch bigger objects			2
these increments are ignited sequentially as the vehicle travels down the 8 inch bore			2
this gives you much lower pressures and much lower g loadings			0
the longer the barrel the more efficient the system becomes , claims its inventor			0
' have you ever wanted to fly something into space but you thought that it was too expensive or too complicated to do it yourself ? ' he says on the @entity38 page for the project			0
' i used to think that way too , and then i invented the @entity20 space cannon			1
' @entity10 decided to redesign the traditional cannon for his space cannon			1
the @entity20 gun is an 8 ” bore by 45 foot long multi-chambered artillery piece that has been custom designed to fire payloads into space			1
' the problem with a conventional gun as a space launcher is that it has one big propellant charge and when that charge is fired it produces a very high pressure spike , often 50,000 to 60,000 @entity56 which drops off rapidly as the projectile travels down the bore , ' said @entity10			1
' these high pressures place high @entity29 on a payload , often tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of @entity61 ’s			0
' launching at high @entity61 may be ok for simple payloads such as fuel or construction materials but it is not much good for launching payloads that are useful for the average person			0
' inventor @entity68 with the cannon			2
he believes it could be scaled up to be 150 feet long @entity10 's invention breaks the propellant charge down into a number of smaller increments			0
these increments are ignited sequentially as the vehicle travels down the bore , resulting in much lower pressures and much lower g loadings			0
' one interesting aspect of this technology is that the longer the barrel the more efficient the system becomes , ' @entity68 said			0
' the @entity20 gun has been limited to 45 ’ only because of the need to keep it road mobile , but with this technology a barrel twice or even three times as long would be practical			1

45 foot @entity20 space cannon could launch small ' *cubesats* ' into orbit
bore *gradually* increases the speed of the payload , *unlike* a traditional ' one blast ' cannon
inventor hopes to test his cannon in *august*
