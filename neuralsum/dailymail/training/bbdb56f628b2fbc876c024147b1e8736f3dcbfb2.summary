@entity1 will bundle the subscription music service it bought from beats into its @entity5 operating system early next year , the @entity0 has claimed			1
the inclusion of the paid - for beats service in an @entity5 software update , which would instantly make it available on millions of iphones and @entity11 , could happen as early as march			1
the service , which is likely to be rebranded under the @entity14 label , will compete with music streaming services like @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18			1
it says @entity1 has 200m active @entity14 customers - and estimates @entity36 has only 110,000 subscribers			1
@entity16 said its subscriber base has grown to 12.5 million , up from 10 million when the number was last reported in may			0
' the inclusion of the paid for @entity3 service in an @entity5 software update could happen as early as march , according to people familiar with the situation , ' the paper said			1
pre-installing apps on devices is seen as a fast way to reach new customers quickly - although the firm is still suffering from the publicity backlash earlier this year when it put a link to download @entity54 # s new album for free onto every @entity14 account			1
the move will pit @entity1 against @entity16 , which has suffered setbacks following a spat with @entity23 and other artists who remain sceptical about the economics of streaming , claiming the @entity63 firm does not pay them enough			2
the music streaming service responded by saying it it fights music piracy and had paid out $ 2 billion to the industry and artists since its launch in 2008			0
the statement in a blog post by ceo @entity73 came a week after @entity74 singer @entity23 pulled her entire catalog from the popular streaming site as she released her new album ' 1989 ' , which immediately soared to the top of the @entity74 charts			0
@entity23 's label @entity81 has declined to say why it asked for @entity23 's albums to be removed from the free service of @entity16 , which also offers a subscription service to users who want to eliminate advertising			2
the app , available on @entity5 , @entity88 and @entity89 , allows music to be streamed for a $ 10 monthly fee but in an op - ed piece for the @entity93 in july , @entity23 wrote that music was valuable and ' it 's my opinion that music should not be free '			2
' @entity23 is absolutely right : music is art , art has real value and artists deserve to be paid for it , ' @entity73 said in the posting on the @entity16 website			0
he said @entity16 was fighting back against music piracy on the @entity106 , which he said generated ' nothing , zilch , zero ' revenue for artists , by offering a combined free listening and subscription service that compensates the music industry			2
its subscriber base has grown to 12.5 million , up from 10 million when the number was last reported in may , he said			0
with revenue coming largely from advertising and subscriptions , @entity16 had paid out $ 1 billion to the recording industry and artists from 2008 to last year , and another $ 1 billion since then , @entity73 said			0
the beats music streaming service was acquired alongside the beats headphone brand when @entity1 bought beats for $ 3bn in may			1
' and that 's $ 2 billion worth of listening that would have happened with zero or little compensation to artists and songwriters through piracy or practically equivalent services if there was no @entity16 , ' he said , taking a swipe at competing internet streaming sites , some of which do not charge users			0
' we 're working day and night to recover money for artists and the music business that piracy was stealing away , ' he said			0
@entity1 's new service will also go up against @entity142			1
@entity142 said last week that @entity143 is rolling out a long - awaited paid monthly music subscription service called @entity145 .			0

firm expected to release update next year for all @entity5 devices
beats music service expected to be rebranded as @entity14
will be @entity1 's first move into subscription services for music
