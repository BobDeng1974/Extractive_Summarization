no probe : @entity1 is refusing to investigate the affair between @entity16 , a member of his legal team , and @entity24 , a lawyer representing phone hacking victims the @entity22 ’s code of conduct suggests affairs between opposing lawyers should be avoided in case the perception be created of ‘ a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy ’			1

the couple did not tell @entity1 or his senior counsel , @entity57 , about the relationship			2
the judge only learnt of their trip to the @entity51 island – during which the couple say they discussed ‘ the possibility of a future relationship ’ – when the @entity66 asked him to comment on it after revealing the affair			0
no effect : @entity1 has dismissed the idea that his report on media standards could have been tainted by the alleged relationship between @entity16 and @entity24 @entity1 has dismissed criticism that the revelations have undermined his inquiry , saying there was ‘ simply no room ’ for a ‘ breach of confidence or other conspiracy ’			1

‘ is it possible that she may have had an input into the inquiry ’s conclusions before august 3 , 2012 ? ‘ if the answer … is yes , i would be grateful if you would confirm what work did ms @entity25 in fact did prior to august 3 ( aside from questioning witnesses )			1
