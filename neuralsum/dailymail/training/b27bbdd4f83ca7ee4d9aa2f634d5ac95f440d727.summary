@entity0 will wonder what he has let himself in for , even if the @entity3 full back does n’t have his contract at @entity5 torn up , in line with the owner ’s threats			1
in a barmy week on the balmy @entity10 , @entity9 warned he may release @entity11 , who is yet to play for his new @entity13 employers due to a persistent groin injury			1
he also threatened to take legal action if @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 do n’t nip back from the @entity19 on the other side of the equator to line up against @entity22 on friday			1
@entity5 have threatened to tear up @entity11 's contract over a persistent groin injury @entity5 owner @entity9 has threatened legal action against players away on internationals instead of taking the matter to court , he will probably adjust their pay instead			1
@entity32 , the @entity34 full back who had a spell at @entity5 , tweeted on thursday : ‘ i came back from the autumn internationals to find out i had been docked a month ’s wages			1
’ @entity5 and other leading @entity13 clubs have engaged in a big - money duel over @entity43 imports , only for the thorny issue of international release to crop up time after time			1
the up - shot is tension and turmoil			0
@entity3 coach @entity49 says that many of his players based across the @entity52 want to leave , while @entity53 is abandoning @entity54 at the first opportunity , next summer , to return to @entity56			2
@entity9 and other wealthy owners have carte blanche to recruit as they see fit , but it is ridiculous to willingly sign current test players then carp when they go off to fulfil international duties			1
rest weekends are a grey area , but the simple solution is to target the domestic market – or test exiles such as @entity67 , who has agreed a new deal at @entity5 – rather than mostly shopping abroad			1
@entity32 revealed his pay was docked by @entity5 for playing in autumn internationals there is a lesson for @entity74 clubs here , following their decision to raise the salary cap and allow for another – overseas – signing outside the cap			1
a @entity81 boom here would increase the temptation to go star shopping , but it is vital to retain the precious emphasis on nurturing home - grown talent , while carefully adding box - office appeal			0
culture is a factor too			0
@entity92 ’s director of rugby , @entity91 , struck the right note when asked about big - name imports , saying : ‘ that is not @entity92 ’s way of doing business			0
we want guys to be here for the long haul			0
’ the @entity104 elite should note the scatter - gun approach of @entity106 , with all the attendant problems , and resolve to fire their golden bullets with more care			1
@entity111 ( r ) staked his claim for @entity104 with a commanding performance against @entity114 it is all working out exactly as @entity116 would have hoped			1
having secured agreement from the @entity74 clubs to delay the announcement of his @entity104 squads for the season , the national coach is witnessing contenders raising their games for early - season auditions			1
last sunday , @entity126 captain @entity111 delivered a colossal defensive display in the win over @entity114 , to put further pressure on the back - row incumbents			1
his personal challenge to the established hierarchy has been matched by a trio of @entity134 ; centre @entity135 , scrum half @entity137 and flanker @entity139 , not to mention @entity141 ’s rookie midfield pair – @entity142 and @entity143			2
in addition , the fly half tussle is a high - class sideshow in its own right , with @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 taking it in turns to excel as they strive to deputise for @entity155 or even usurp him			2
test cases are being made with heartening regularity for the @entity104 coaches			2
now they just have to hope that the exuberant efforts do n’t lead to a pile - up of injuries … @entity149 's ( c ) form for @entity164 could see him threaten @entity155 's @entity104 place the architect of @entity169 ’s @entity168 triumph in 2011 has warned that the @entity169 may have trouble retaining their title if they keep winning			1
@entity174 ’s dominant side have lost just once since the last global tournament and have n’t been beaten at home since 2009 , but @entity177 does n’t think that is entirely good news			2
‘ i think they need to lose , ’ he said			0
@entity177 believes @entity169 must lose if they want to retain the @entity168 ‘ the odd hiccup here and there gives you the opportunity to re-analyse where you are at , look at everything , turn over every stone ; make sure you 're on the right track			1
if you do n’t do that you might miss something			0
i think ( a loss ) galvanises people			0
’ @entity169 face @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 in their @entity168 pool next year			1
there is a very real threat that they could progress serenely between now and the quarter - finals , then find themselves caught cold , as they were under @entity177 in 2007			2
@entity205 are attempting to lure the @entity206 back to their shores in 2017 , even though @entity208 and @entity209 ’s finest were there for a tour last year			0
in a bid to generate much - needed income , the @entity211 have made a pitch to stage a warm - up match before the @entity206 arrive in @entity169			2
chief executive @entity216 said : ‘ if they want preliminary games outside @entity169 , then we would be a wonderful location			2
we would take it in a heartbeat			0
’ @entity205 want to lure the @entity206 back after they played an opener in @entity224 last year last year , the @entity206 stopped off in @entity224 for a tour opener prior to landing @entity226 , in what was an overwhelmingly commercial venture			0
this @entity229 offer must be politely rebuffed			0
@entity169 can deliver enough suitable , pre-test series opposition to make a game outside that country unnecessary			1
but if one is to take place , the @entity206 should take their high - profile roadshow to where it can do some good ; the @entity238			0
if trips to any one of the @entity243 nations became more regular than the current once - every - 12 - years routine , the aura and the magic will be lost			0
these @entity206 should be rare attractions			0
the last word the @entity245 have blundered into a storm this week , in relation to the new @entity104 kits			2
the inclusion of @entity251 symbols within the fabric of the shirt led to accusations of disrespecting military sacrifice			1
but this was clumsy , rather than a crass insult to servicemen and women			0
@entity116 has invoked the country ’s armed forces repeatedly as a source of inspiration , without suggesting that the heroism required on a rugby field equates to that needed in armed conflict			2
this is a game in which courage is a pre-requisite , but it is not a life - and - death exercise			0
the inclusion of the @entity251 in @entity104 's new shirts has kicked up controversy @entity276 once said football meant more than that , while warfare terminology has long abounded in sport			1
the 1991 @entity281 in golf was dubbed the ‘ @entity283 ’			0
more recently , @entity285 ’s @entity284 have worn army - camouflage kit			0
@entity287 referred to sport as ‘ war minus the shooting ’ and the tribalism involved has led to endless talk of battles , which largely amounts to harmless hype			0
the use of @entity251 on the @entity104 shirt is an error of judgment and the @entity245 have duly apologised			1
the underlying concept of national service was well - intentioned , but the symbolism was mis - guided .			0

@entity5 have threatened to terminate @entity11 's contract before he has even played a game
owner @entity9 has also warned legal action against several players a for playing internationals
@entity116 's idea to delay @entity104 squad announcement is working
@entity111 , @entity135 and @entity149 are all staking claims
@entity177 claims @entity169 need to lose to retain the @entity168
inclusion of @entity251 in @entity104 shirts has caused controversy
