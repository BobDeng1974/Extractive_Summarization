a woman was left with huge white patches all over her body after developing skin condition vitiligo as a child			1
@entity5 , 24 , who is from @entity6 , was targeted by bullies who made her life a misery			1
but a new treatment and a state of the art makeover could be about to change that			0
' i now have white patches covering more than a third of my body			2
' the condition is not life - threatening but its psychological effects can be devastating to sufferers			2
' when i was in high school the kids were very mean to me , ' added the 24 - year - old			2
' the abuse , the name - calling and the fighting were all very difficult to deal with			0
' i would just go home and cry - i would always run home straight to my sister , she has always had my back and fought my battles for me			0
' i 'm just so glad i had somebody there who would stick up for me and help me through the difficult times			0
@entity5 pictured with skin specialist dr @entity52 who hopes to give her @entity54 light therapy @entity5 , seen prior to a light therapy treatment , says she often receives stares and jibes in public ' the years of bullying have led me to always expect the worst when i 'm out in public			1
' when she is walking around her home @entity6 in @entity64 , @entity5 often attracts stares from passersby			2
her friend @entity67 said : ' the stares are difficult to deal with			0
until the light therapy has had a chance to take effect , @entity5 is having make - up applied to cover her white patches the make - up is perfectly shaded to @entity5 's skin using a specialist computer program the computer analysis means that the make up is an exact match to @entity5 's skin , creating the illusion of normal skin and totally transforming @entity5 's day - to - day life @entity5 seen with dermatologist @entity79 after make up has been used to cover her vitiligo ' instead of just saying : ' hello , how are you ? ' people just stare at her			1
' amazingly she does not let it get to her or if she does , she does not show it			0
' @entity85 is a long - term condition that causes pale , white patches to develop on the skin due to lack of a chemical called melanin			1
melanin is produced by specialised skin cells called melanocytes , gives your skin its colour and protects it from the sun. it is not exactly clear what causes this lack of melanin , but it has been linked to problems with the immune system ( autoimmune conditions ) and nerve endings in the skin			0
certain things can increase your chances of developing vitiligo , such as a family history of the condition or having another autoimmune problem , like hyperthyroidism ( an overactive thyroid gland )			2
@entity85 can affect any area of your skin , but most commonly occurs on skin exposed to the sun , such as your face , neck and hands			0
the condition varies from person to person			0
some people only get a few small , white patches that progress no further			0
other people get bigger white patches that join up across large areas of their skin			0
there is no way of predicting how much of your skin will be affected			0
the white patches are usually permanent			0
source : @entity134 @entity5 had a normal , happy childhood until she noticed a white mark on her body - but she had no idea what was to come or how fast it would spread			1
she added : ' i noticed it when i was around seven years old , then it developed on to my leg and it just kept spreading			1
' after 17 years of suffering she has turned to a skin specialist to for help			1
dr @entity52 said : ' this condition dramatically affects quality of life			0
' it can interfere with a person 's physical and mental well - being with devastating effects			2
' but there is hope available for @entity5 , i 'm recommending a course of @entity54 light therapy which should re-colour her skin			1
' the therapy could take some time to take effect , so in the short term @entity5 has been given a specialist cover - up product			1
a computer generates a special formula after analysing images of @entity5 's skin and it tells a dermatologist how much of each colour to use to cover over the white patches			1
after the procedure , @entity5 said : ' it just feels absolutely fantastic - to see the smile on my sister 's face when she saw me really warms my heart and my soul			1
' i feel like i can be me again			0
' @entity5 's story appears in a new series of @entity181 , which airs every thursday at 9pm on @entity182 throughout his career @entity184 's skin tone became increasingly lighter ( l - r ) 1975 , 1983 and 2007 pop legend @entity184 is undoubtedly one of the most famous sufferers of the skin condition ever			1
the @entity189 singer announced that the cause of his dramatically lightening skin was vitiligo in a 1993 interview on @entity196 's self titled chat show			1
at the time there were various rumours being put forward as to the reason behind the singer seemingly changing ethnicity			0
@entity201 had already had surgery to slim down his nose when his skin tone began to become drastically whiter from around the mid 1980s - leading some to speculate the singer was using skin bleaching as part of a effort to ' @entity209 ' his appearance			1
however , upon @entity184 's death from cardiac arrest on june 25 2009 , the autopsy revealed that @entity184 , who was 50 at the time of his death , was indeed suffering with vitiligo			2
dr @entity217 confirmed from his autopsy that @entity184 's skin became lighter in the 1980s owing to ' vitiligo , a skin pigmentation disease			1
' he added : ' so some areas of the skin appear light and others appear dark			2

@entity5 developed skin condition vitiligo when she just seven years old
began with just a patch on her leg but soon spread to cover her whole body
suffered horrendous bullying for 17 years before seeking professional help
now having @entity54 light therapy to re-colour her skin
