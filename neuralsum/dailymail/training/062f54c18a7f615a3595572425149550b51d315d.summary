a hungry hyena has found a clever way to store its leftovers for another meal - by hiding them at the bottom of a waterhole			2
photographer @entity7 , 46 , said she spotted the hyena seemingly fishing in the water at the @entity11 waterhole in @entity12 , @entity13			1
but on closer inspection it became clear that the predator was actually trying to dive for something specific			1
down we go : the hyena was seemingly fishing in the water at the @entity11 waterhole in @entity12 , @entity13 back to the surface : on closer inspection it became clear that the predator was actually trying to dive for something specific success : after a few attempts it came back to the surface with a chuck of meat proudly locked in its jaws - ripped from a carcass after a few attempts it came back to the surface with a chuck of meat proudly locked in its jaws - ripped from a carcass left at the river bed			1
mrs @entity7 , from @entity40 , @entity13 , said : ‘ i found a lone hyena circling the middle of the waterhole with only its head sticking out			1
‘ i 've seen hyenas sitting in water to cool themselves off before but never have i seen one this much submerged before			0
‘ to my absolute astonishment it proceeded to dive down head - first to the bottom and came up with something in its mouth			2
‘ i eventually came to the conclusion it was fishing - it proved very entertaining and i watched these antics for quite a while			0
approaching : the photographer set up her camera gear and waited for the hyena to bring something up to the surface and onto land hungry : other hyenas wait outside the @entity11 waterhole in @entity12 , @entity13 , hoping to share the meat getting in the action : this was the only spotted hyena displaying the skilled behaviour , according to the photographer ‘ looking at the photographs later that evening i studied the object in its mouth more closely and found it did n't resemble any fish			1
‘ next morning i trundled off to the same waterhole and sure enough , the same hyena was doing exactly the same thing as the previous day			0
’ mrs @entity7 set up her camera gear and waited for the hyena to bring something up to the surface and onto land			2
she added : ‘ the hyena came up with a large chunk of something and swam to shore			0
‘ only then did it dawn on me there must be a carcass lying at the bottom of the waterhole			0
guarding the meat : the hyena found a clever way to store its leftovers for another meal - by hiding them at the bottom of a waterhole caught on camera : the hyena regurgitates the meat for the other hyenas ( left ) , photographed by 46 - year - old @entity7 ( right ) ‘ incidentally this was the only spotted hyena displaying this skilled behaviour - none of the other members of the clan attempted to follow suit			1
‘ apparently hyena have been known to stash their food in water			0
' it 's very likely this hyena stored the carcass and has gone back at intervals to retrieve it			2
‘ that 's the beauty with interactions and observations like this - it 's fascinating and we learn a lot about animal behaviour			0
