the smell of a baby excites a woman in the same way an addict craving for drugs enjoys his fix , say scientists			0
a newborn 's odour is a chemical communication between mother and child and sparks the same reward circuits in the brain as when eating something nice - or having sex			1
researchers say when a woman feels like ' gobbling up ' a baby placed in her arms - even if it 's not hers - it 's a natural biological reaction linked to maternal functions			1

when a woman feels like ' gobbling up ' a baby placed in her arms - even if it 's not hers - it 's a natural biological reaction linked to maternal functions dr @entity34 , of @entity35 , said : ' the olfactory - thus non-verbal and non-visual - chemical signals for communication between mother and child are intense			1
' what we 've shown for the first time is the odour of newborns - which is part of these signals - activates the neurological reward circuit in mothers			1
@entity50 researchers found the odour of newborns activates the neurological reward circuit in mothers ' these circuits may especially be activated when you eat while being very hungry , but also in a craving addict receiving his drug			1
it is in fact the sating of desire			0
' dr @entity34 and colleagues presented two groups of 15 women - one that had given birth within six weeks and the other who had never had babies - with the pyjama scents of newborns while scanning their brains			2
although the babies were not their own the pleasure chemical dopamine shot up on the images of the mothers in the caudate nucleus compared to the non-mothers , says the study published in @entity78			0
the caudate nucleus is in the centre of the brain and plays a role in reward learning			2
dr @entity34 said : ' and dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter in the neural reward circuit			0
' this system reinforces the motivation to act in a certain way because of the pleasure associated with a given behaviour			0
dr @entity34 said : ' this circuit makes us desire certain foods and causes addiction to tobacco and other drugs			0
not all odours trigger this reaction			0
' only those associated with reward - such as food or satisfying a desire - cause this activation			2
' dopamine is also associated with sexual pleasure and other forms of gratification			0
the study shows the odour of newborns plays a role in the development of motivational and emotional responses between mother and child by eliciting maternal care functions such as breastfeeding and protection			1
the mother - child bond that is part of the feeling of maternal love is a product of evolution through natural selection in an environment where such a bond is essential for the newborn 's survival			1
dr @entity34 said : ' it 's possible childbirth causes hormonal changes that alter the reward circuit in the caudate nucleus - but it 's also possible that experience plays a role			1
it 's also not known of this reaction is specific to mothers since men were not part of the @entity140 said : ' what we know now and what is new is there is a neural response linked to the status of biological mother			2

a newborn 's odour is a ' chemical communication between mother and child '
and that it sparks the same reward circuits in the brain as when eating something nice - or having sex , say @entity50 researchers
