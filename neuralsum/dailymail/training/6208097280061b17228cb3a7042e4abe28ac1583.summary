by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 08:47 est , 8 september 2012 the @entity1 released a photo of first daughters @entity4 and @entity5 sitting on a couch with their father as they watched their mother give her moving convention speech last night			1
while the image of the threesome closely huddled together on the couch is undeniably heart - warming , even more striking is the degree to which the two young girls have grown over the past four years			2
the two daughters look like true teenagers four years after they were introduced to the world 's stage during mr @entity5 's first presidential campaign			2
this official @entity1 photographs shows @entity23 president @entity22 and his daughters , @entity4 ( left ) and @entity5 watch @entity25 on television in the @entity27 of the @entity1 on tuesday night last night four years ago : the two girls joined their mother on stage at the convention in @entity31 after her speech in 2008 , but they were unable to do the same this year because it was the first day of school ' hi daddy ! ' they all waved to their father who was watching from @entity36 at the time back then : @entity4 ( left ) and @entity5 ( center right ) were only 10 and 7 years old respectively when they appeared at the @entity39 in @entity31 in 2008 on the night their father accepted the nomination during the initial campaign , @entity4 was only 10 and @entity5 , whose real name is @entity43 , looks like a baby as she was only seven years old			1
with two summer birthdays - @entity5 's in june and @entity4 's on the @entity47 - they now have yet another year under their belts , and they are starting to truly look like the young ladies that they are			1
in last night 's photo , both girls were wearing skinny jeans , though they both took different approaches to the popular style			2
@entity4 sported a light blue pair with a white and grey blouse while @entity5 snuggled up with a faded pair that almost appeared acid washed			1
she completed her convention night look with a striped tank top and collection of various bracelets			0
the two girls were unable to join their mother in @entity65 on the night of her speech - which has received almost universal praise - because it was their first day of school			1
@entity5 is now in sixth grade at @entity71 , which they chose to attend once their father was elected and they moved to @entity73 color coordinated : on election night 2008 , it was clear that someone else picked out the girl 's outfits			1
more recently , it appears that the girls have had more of a say in their attire as they begin to experiment most changed : while both girls have obviously matured , @entity5 , who wore peach at the inauguration ( left ) and was only 7 when she moved into the @entity1 , looks much older now ( right ) vacation time : this past @entity91 , in 2011 , the first family traveled to their father 's home state of @entity95 parental pride : @entity1 photographer @entity97 captured this moment last night in the @entity27 @entity4 just had her first day of high school on tuesday , reaching a milestone in her education thus far			1
president and first lady @entity5 sat down with @entity104 during a campaign stop towards the end of august and at that time they said how there was a lot to think about in terms of back - to - school preparations and @entity4 's transition to high school			1
' she 's going to be great			0
the truth is my girls , they do n't seem to have all the flaws i had when i was their age			2
they 're just good kids - smart , hardworking , kind , and respectful			0
they 'll adjust really well , ' mr @entity5 said			2
@entity25 then corrected him and said that he should n't rush @entity122 to grow up quite yet , teasingly saying ' she 's the baby '			0
' she 's going through her own transistion into young ladyhood			0
we pretend she 's a baby			0
except she 's grown about a foot , ' he responded			0
while it is fair to assume that they would have liked to have their mom - in - chief home yesterday afternoon for the start of school , the close bond they show with their father in the relaxed photo released after @entity25 's speech was not simply made up for the cameras			1
first lady @entity25 addresses the @entity39 in @entity65 , @entity139 , on tuesday , september 4th all smiles : @entity23 president @entity22 and first lady @entity25 like to stay home with their daughters @entity4 , pictured left , and @entity5 , right , rather than go out daddy daughter time : @entity5 was seen lifting @entity5 out of a car in 2008 ( left ) and walking with @entity4 very recently ( right ) as they left the @entity1 loving dad : @entity5 , pictured with his daughters , @entity4 , left , and @entity5 , far right , helps with homework at the @entity1 it is well - known that when mr @entity5 is in or near @entity73 , he always tries to be home for dinner with the girls at 6.30pm			1
in her speech last night , mrs @entity25 confirmed that , saying that he enjoys ' strategizing about middle school friendships ' with his daughters			2
his priority last night , however , was keeping a straight face during her emotional and personal speech			0
' i 'm going to be at home , and i 'm going to be watching it with our girls			0
and i 'm going to try not to let them see their daddy cry			0
because when @entity25 starts talking , i start getting all misty , ' he said at a campaign event earlier that morning .			0
