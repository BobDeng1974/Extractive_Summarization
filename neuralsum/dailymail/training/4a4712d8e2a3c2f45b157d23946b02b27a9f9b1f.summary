televangelist @entity0 has been dishing out his own unique brand of marriage guidance advice again , this time telling the wife of a cheating husband to get over her man ’s infidelity and start doing more to ensure he does n’t have reason to wander			1
‘ stop talking about the cheating ! ’ he told the woman during wednesday 's episode of his daily television program , ‘ @entity13			1
’ the infamous evangelist was responding to a letter he had received from a woman called @entity17 , who had admitted to struggling with forgiveness			0
how do you let go of the anger ? how do you trust again ? ’ she wrote			0
@entity0 , known for his forthright views on a wide range of topics including homosexuality and politics , did n’t beat around the bush with his answer			2
‘ here 's the secret , ’ he said			0
‘ stop talking the cheating			2
he cheated on you , well , he 's a man			2
’ instead of focusing on the misdemeanor , @entity0 told the woman to remind herself why she married her spouse and then fall in love with him all over again			1
‘ does he provide a home for you to live in , ’ he said			2
' does he provide food for you to eat ? does he provide clothes for you to wear ? is he nice to the children ... is he handsome ? ’ on a roll , @entity0 offered further anecdotal advice on the ‘ tendency of man			1
’ @entity0 also told the viewer that it was n't really her husband 's fault he had cheated because modern society is filled with so much temptation ‘ recognize also , like it or not , males have a tendency to wander a little bit , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ what you want to do is make a home so wonderful that he does n't want to wander			1
’ @entity0 also reminded the woman that it was n’t really the man ’s fault he had cheated because modern society is filled with so much temptation such as the internet ‘ filled with pornography ’ and magazine full of ‘ salacious ’ pictures			1
‘ thank @entity74 that you have a marriage that is together and that you live in @entity76 and good things are happening , ’ said @entity0			1
this is n’t the televangelist 's first foray into marital counseling , earlier this year he told woman that if their husband is n't paying attention , it 's probably because you do n't look ' pretty ' and ' alert '			1
' a woman came to a preacher i know - it ’s so funny , ' said @entity0 on his show in january			2
' she was awful - looking			0
her hair was all torn up , she was overweight and looked terrible , clothes bad and everything , and she said , " @entity95 , what can i do ? my husband has started to drink			0
" watch : @entity0 dish out his latest marriage advice since establishing the @entity98 in 1960 , @entity0 has been no stranger to controversy			1
' and the preacher looked at her and he said : " madam , if i were married to you , i 'd start to drink too			0
" ' @entity0 chuckled and added , ' we need to cultivate romance , darling			2
' ' you always have to keep that spark of love alive , ' he said			0
' it is n't something to just lie there [ and think ] " well i 'm married to him , so he 's got to take me slatternly - looking			2
" you have got to fix yourself up , look pretty , look alert			0
' but unkempt women are n't solely responsible for failed marriages , @entity0 reasoned			1
that presumption would completely overlook another chief antagonist to an otherwise perfect union : stubborn women			0
stubborn women can also kill a romance in a heartbeat , according to @entity0			2
offering his advice to a 17 - year - old whose parents were having marital problems , @entity0 suggested that the boy 's mother was at fault			1
if your husband is n't paying attention to you , it 's probably because you do n't look ' pretty ' and ' alert , ' @entity0 told viewers in january writing to the mens ' magazine @entity136 , the teenager wrote : ' i ’m 17 years old and i ’ve noticed that there has been a change in my father ’s behavior			1
he spends too much time at the computer playing a war game			0
i ’ve noticed how alone my mom feels			0
i just want my father to spend more time with my mom			0
what should i do ? how can i talk to my father ? i feel shame for him			0
' @entity0 encouraged the boy to send his parents on a romantic getaway			2
' the romance is obviously going out of the marriage , ' he said			0
' it 's not as much excitement as it used to be and you know , it may be your mom is n’t as sweet as you think she is			0
' ' she may be kind of hard - nosed , ' he continued			0
' and so , you say , it ’s my father , he ’s not paying attention to mom , but is mom ... ' @entity0 trailed off and started chuckling			0
his female co-host interjected , ' how are you going to blame the mother ? ' @entity0 shot back : ' it 's easy to blame the mother ! ' the co-host laughed uncomfortably			1
' it comes with 58 years of marriage i know what i 'm talking about , okay ? ' @entity0 snapped			1
' now what 's next ? ' @entity0 tells his female co-host that it 's ' easy ' to blame women for failed marriages			1

he advised a viewer to stop focusing on her husband cheating because that is the ' tendency of man '
he also suggested it was n't the man 's fault as modern society is filled with temptations
the wife was told ' to make a home so wonderful that he does n't want to wander '
' thank @entity74 that you have a marriage that is together and that you live in @entity76 and good things are happening , ' said @entity0
