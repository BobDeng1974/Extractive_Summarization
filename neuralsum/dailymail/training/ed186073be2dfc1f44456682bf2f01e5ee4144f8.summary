by @entity1 reporter published : 19:55 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 10:49 est , 12 october 2012 almost 6,000 buildings and historic sites are at risk of being lost , @entity2 has revealed			1
the latest @entity6 revealed that 5,831 listed buildings , monuments , archaeological sites , battlefields , shipwrecks , places of worship , conservation areas and landscapes in @entity16 are under threat from neglect , decay and damage			1
the figure includes heritage sites with the highest levels of protection , @entity25 * listing , across the country but those with the lower @entity30 listing have only been included in @entity31			1
a terrible loss : grade i listed @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 at death 's door : grade ii @entity40 on the @entity42 curtain call : @entity30 * listed @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , which was licensed in 1912 and is a very well preserved example of an early purpose - built cinema @entity2 also announced a programme to assess @entity16 ’s 345,000 grade ii listed buildings , funding between nine and 15 pilot surveys with local authorities and other groups to find out which such structures are at risk			2
@entity30 sites already known to be at risk include an 18th century windmill in west @entity59 , an @entity61 lido for women in @entity63 and the dramatic front portico of a @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67			1
this year ’s register shows that 318 @entity25 * buildings and sites have been saved and are no longer at risk but 360 heritage structures and places have been added			2
with just 13 per cent of those on the list considered to be economic to repair , @entity2 ’s director of heritage protection dr @entity74 said that in the current climate , efforts to save buildings may have to focus on ' holding ' measures			0
must try harder : @entity84 in @entity66 , @entity83 is a @entity30 building at risk lost and @entity87 : @entity87 in @entity88 scrubs up nicely : @entity89 in @entity63 , @entity90 boarded up : @entity91 , @entity92 on @entity93 , @entity83 , is a @entity30 building at risk buildings could be saved with innovative schemes by people to find ways to preserve and find new use for structures , he said , adding ' there has never been a time when imagination and commitment has been more important '			1
other examples of heritage at risk are @entity30 * listed @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , which was licensed in 1912 and is a very well preserved example of an early purpose - built cinema but has been vacant for 10 years			2
@entity113 ’s @entity30 * @entity112 rollercoaster was built in 1919 - 20 but was badly damaged by fire in 2008 and is on the heritage at risk list			1
there are plans , supported by @entity2 and the @entity119 , to breathe new life into the @entity112 amusement park and scenic railway in the @entity124 seaside town , and it is hoped the site has a future off the at - risk register			0
a huff and a puff could blow this down : @entity132 in @entity133 not so grand : the main stairway at the @entity135 in @entity136 ( left ) and @entity137 , in @entity138 , @entity139 bitter @entity140 : @entity30 building at @entity142 , @entity143 had its ups and downs : the @entity30 - listed @entity147 at @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity124 , is @entity149 's oldest surviving rollercoaster @entity149 ’s first atomic bomb store on @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , a @entity30 * scheduled monument , has been added to the at - risk register			2
from the mid- 1960s onwards , the site ’s watchtowers were vandalised and they and the 66 kiosks used for storing nuclear components fell into disrepair			0
@entity2 said it has worked with the owners to help refurbish the five watch towers and carry out restoration , but much more needs to be done			0
@entity164 , chief executive of @entity2 , said : ' we launched a first - ever buildings at risk register in 1998			0
we have expanded it over the years to include archaeology , monuments , gardens , conservation areas , places of worship , wrecks and battlefields			1
for whom the bell tolls : @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181 mixed fortunes : while @entity186 's @entity185 ( left ) remains at risk , @entity183 ( right ) in @entity184 has recently been removed from the register ring the changes : @entity186 's @entity185 , @entity190 , @entity191 deteriorating : @entity30 sites already known to be at risk include the dramatic front portico of a @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity92 - on - @entity93 ' now with the economic climate putting more pressure than ever on @entity30 buildings , it ’s time to plug the one remaining gap			1
' @entity2 said @entity30 buildings account for 92 per cent of all listed buildings and include houses , shops , inns , offices , schools , town halls , libraries , farms and mills which make up the character of @entity16 ’s towns and country			0
dr @entity164 said : ' @entity30 buildings are the bulk of the nation ’s heritage treasury			0
when one of them is lost , it ’s as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past ; something that made your street or your village special will have gone			0
' the number of @entity30 listed buildings is not large in relation to all the buildings in @entity16 but it is too many for @entity2 to survey on its own , he said			0
the heritage body is funding the pilot surveys to work with local people to find out what historic buildings and sites most need scarce resources			0
under repair : the store tower has recently been added to the heritage at risk register up and atom : former top secret @entity246 atomic bomb store site at @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , has recently been considered ' at risk ' and is undergoing repairs spy in the sky : the @entity246 atomic bomb storage site was once top secret looks like a bomb has hit it : @entity149 's first atomic bomb store on @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 trouble at mill : @entity30 windmill in the garden of @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity59 ​ ( left ) , and a bunker at the atomic bomb store on @entity151 , ( right ) needs a bit of work : @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 worn out : @entity268 in @entity266 , @entity267 , has seen better days raise a toast : the toasting gate at @entity271 , @entity184 , has been removed from the register after repair work was carried out			1
