such was the hype surrounding the trial that it was ordered moved from @entity116 of the @entity118 ' home , to @entity86			0
but @entity83 argued that the trial should have been moved yet again because of the crush of publicity in @entity86			0
' before hearing even a single witness , nearly half of all prospective jurors admitted they had already decided mr @entity4 was guilty of capital murder , ' @entity83 argues			1
and in what may be a first for the @entity129 system of justice , outside the courthouse in which the parties would try to select a fair jury , a radio station posted a large billboard which had a telephone number for people to call in and vote ' whether @entity4 was a man or monster '			1

' after the guilty verdict was announced , the 12 jurors departing to await the beginning of the penalty phase - and decide whether mr. @entity4 would live or die - were met with wild applause and cheering			2
' beyond issues with the publicity , @entity83 argues the judge made several erroneous evidentiary decisions and other rulings that led to @entity4 receiving an unfair trial			2
@entity83 notes that @entity4 was convicted and sentenced to death even though investigators never directly proved ' how , where or when ' the murder occurred			1
prosecutors told the jury that @entity25 was killed sometime between the night of december 23 , 2002 and the following morning			1
